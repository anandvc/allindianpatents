				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the (co)polymerization of alpha olefins.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a catalytic system comprising a metallocene complex of a transition metal, active in homo- and co-polymerization processes of alpha-olefins, and particularly ethylene.<br>
It is generally known in the art that alpha-olefins can be polymerized by means of low, medium or high pressure processes with catalysts based on a transition metal, generally known as Ziegler-Natta type catalysts.<br>
A particular group of these catalysts, generally having very high polymerization activities, consists of the combination of an organo-oxygenated derivative of aluminium (commonly called aluminoxane) with a n5 -cyclopentadienyl derivative of a transition metal, also commonly called metallocene, which can be defined in its most general form with the following formula (I):<br><br>
wherein M represents a  metal of group 4   of the periodical table of elements,<br><br>
formally in the oxidation state of+4, and is preferably titanium or zirconium; R' and R2 each independently represent a group having an anionic nature such as, for example, a hydride, a haiide, a phosphonated or sulfonated anion, an alkyl or alkoxy group, an aryl or aryloxy group, an amide group, a silyl group, etc; Cp independently represents a ligand of the n-cyclopentadienyl type and is generally selected from ri'-cyclopentadienyl, n'-indenyl, r|'-fIuorenyl and their variously substituted derivatives; R' can, independently of the nature of the other substitutes, have one of the definitions of the ligand Cp, or R' or R2 groups. "Bridged" metallocenes are also of particular interest in the known art, wherein the two Cp and Rj groups, the same or different, are linked by a covalent bridge which normally also comprises other carbon atoms or heteroatoms. For a known technique for the preparation of the above compounds, reference should be made, as an example, to the publication of H. Sinn, W. Kaminsky, in Adv. Organomet. Chem., vol. 18 (1980), page 99 and U.S. patent 4.542.199.<br>
Catalytic systems based on metallocenes normally allow high polymerization activities to be reached in the presence of an aluminoxane in great molar excess with respect to the metal M, with an atomic ratio Al/M usually between 500 and 5000. This creates the presence of a relatively high quantity of aluminium in the polyolefins thus obtained, consequently making them unsuitable for numerous applications in which the presence of metal ions is not tolerable, such as, for example, when insulating properties or food compatibi-lity are required.<br>
In addition, aluminoxanes and particularly methylalumoxane which is the activator normally used, necessitate relatively complicated synthetic methods and conservation which make their use in various applications inconvenient with respect to the less costly traditional catalytic systems based on titanium or vanadium chlorides and aluminiumalkyls.<br>
More recently catalysts of the metallocene type have been developed, which<br><br>
are capable of polymerizing olefins also without aluminium compounds and particularly aluminoxanes. These systems are commonly based on the formation of a catalytic species of a cationic nature, obtained by the contact of a suitable metallocene with strong Lewis acids. Various cationic systems of this type are described for example, in the publications of R.R, Jordan in "Advances in Organometallic Chemistry", vol. 32 (1990), pages 325-387, and X. Yang et al. in "Journal of the American Chemical Society", vol. 116 (1994), page 10015, which provide, as well as a detailed description of the field, numerous patent references on the subject.<br>
The activity of cationic metallocene catalytic systems is generally lower, however, than the high activity of systems using methylalumoxane in prejudice of a wider diffusion of the former.<br>
A small increase in the activity of catalysts comprising metallocenes of transition metals, particularly Ti and Zr, has been observed in oligo- and poly-merization processes of alpha-olefins carried out in polar solvents. F.S. Duiachkovskii et al., in "Journal of Polymer Science, Part C", vol. 16 (1967) pages 1333-1339, describes an increase in the oligomerization constant of 1-decene in the presence of a catalytic system obtained by the combination of cyclopentadienyltitanium methylchloride with aluminiummethyldichloride, when the solvent medium varies from benzene to dichloroethane. The same reference also describes a polymerization experiment of ethylene in dichloroethane using the same catalytic system in the presence of an electric field. In each case the productivities observed were low. A polymerization process of olefins carried out in a solvent such as dichloroethane is also industrially unrealistic owing to the great purification difficulties of the polymer obtained with this process and for the high operating costs of the process itself<br>
German patent 4.426.122 (Nippon Oil) discloses the use of an organic<br><br>
compound containing at least one fluorine-carbon bond to increase the activity of a catalytic system comprising a metallocene of a metal of group 4 of the periodic table and methylaluminoxane (MAO). Also in this case, however, a relatively small increase in activity is observed, which is obtained, in addition, in the presence of MAO, with the relative disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
European patent application pub. No. 648,786 relates to a polymerization catalyst comprising an ionic metallocene and a Lewis base. Although increased polymerization activities are shown at high temperature with diisobutylphthalate, the strong Lewis bases disclosed in this reference are known to have a poisoning effect on olefin polymerization catalyst which make their use unsuitable for many processes at low to medium temperature.<br>
The demand for metallocene catalysts with a high activity excluding the use of aluminoxanes as activators therefore remains unanswered.<br>
The Applicant has now surprisingly found that the activity of metallocene catalysts not comprising aluminoxanes is considerably increased in the presence of particular organic substances not containing metals.<br>
A first object of the present invention therefore relates to an improved catalyst for the (co)polymerization of alpha-olefins comprising the following components in contact with each other;<br>
(A)	a metallocene derivative of a metal selected fiom the group consisting of transition metals and lanthanides, capable in itself of promoting the polymerization of olefins without organo-oxygenated compounds of metals of groups 13 or 14 of the periodic table of elements,<br>
(B)	a substance not containing metal atoms, characterized in that this substance (B) consists of an aprotic polar compound having a weak co-ordinating capacity.<br>
A second object of the present invention relates to an improved process for<br><br>
the (co)polymerization of aipha-olefins characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of the above improved catalyst.<br>
The term "(co)polymerization of alpha-olefms" as used hereafter in the text and claims refers both to the homopolymerization and copolymerization of alpha-olefms with each other or with another ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compound.<br>
The metallocene derivative (A) of the present invention is an organometallic compound of a transition metal or lanthanide, preferably a metal selected from Ti, Zr and Hf, characterized by the presence of at least one r|-cyclopentadienyl group co-ordinated to the metal, and by the capacity of promoting the polymerization of alpha-olefms also without an organo-oxygenated compound of a metal of groups 13 or 14 of the periodic table. These organo-oxygenated compounds are monomeric or polymeric organometallic derivatives containing at least one oxygen atom linked to a metal of group 13 or 14 of the periodic table, such as, for example, aluminoxanes, especially methylaluminoxane, galloxanes or stannoxanes, which are widely used as co-catalysts of many catalytic systems based on metallocenes.<br>
The elements silicon and carbon, belonging to group 14 of the periodic table of elements are not considered metals for the purposes of the present invention. In accordance with the present invention the term "transition metals" refers to metals of groups 3 to 10 of the periodic table, whereas "lanthanides" are metals having an atomic number of between 57 and 71,<br>
Metallocene derivatives (A) of the type defined above are known and have been widely described in literature. They usually consist of an ionic (anion-cation) system in which the cation comprises the metallocene. These metallocene derivatives (A) can be obtained by different methods described in literature, generally by the reaction of a metallocene with a compound capable of extracting a group  sigma-bonded to the metal with the formation of a cationic species.<br><br>
Metallocenes which are suitable for the formation of these ionic metallocene derivatives are those having the following general formula (II):<br><br>
wherein:    M represents a metal selected from metals of groups 3 to 5, or from the group of lanthanides in the periodic table of elements; Cp is an anion containing a r|-cyclopentadienyl ring co-ordinated to the metal M,<br>
each of the n R' independently represent a substituent group selected from hydride, halide, a C,-Cs alkyl group, a €3-0,2 alkylsilyl group, a C,-Cj cycloalkyl group, a Cg-C,o aryl group, a €,-€, alkoxyl group, a C,-Cg carboxyl group, a €,-€,„ dialkylamide group and a C4-C2Q alkylsilylamide group;<br>
R" represents a substituent group of the same nature as the previous R' groups, independently selected from these, or a second anion containing a Ti'-cyclopentadienyl ring co-ordinated to the metal M; R'" represents a divalent group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, preferably 0, N, P pr Si, which is bridge-linked between Cp and R" with a covalent bond. R'" is preferably selected from alkylene, dialkylsilylene, diarylsilylene, alkyl-or aryl amino or phosphino radicals, arylene, arylene-bis-alkylene etc. "n" is an integer and is equal to the valence of M less 2; "x" can be 0 or 1.<br><br>
In the compounds having the above formula (II), when "x" is 0 the two groups R" and C are not bridge-linked to each other. Typical non-limiting examples of R'" are methylene, 1,2-ethylene, dimethylsilylene groups.<br>
The metal M in the compound having formula (II) is preferably selected from titanium, zirconium or hafnium in their oxidation state of+4. In this case "n" in formula (II) is preferably equal to 2.<br>
According to the present invention, the R' groups of formula (II) can each independently represent a hydride or halide, such as chloride or bromide, a C,-Cg alkyl group such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, butyl, isopropyl, isoamyl, octyl, benzyl, a C-Cjj alkylsilyl group such as, for example, trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl or tributylsilyl, a cycloalkyl group such as cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, a Cg-Cm aryl group such as phenyl or toluyl, a C,-Cg alkoxyl group such as, for example, methoxyl, ethoxyl, iso- or sec-butoxyl, or again, a C-Cjo dialkylamide or C4-C20 alkylsilylamide group, preferably of the type which can be represented with the general formula -NR'R' wherein K* and R' are alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl or butyl groups, or, in the case of alkylsilylamides, alkylsilyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as, for example, trimethylsilyl or triethylsilyl. The R' groups, when "n" is equal to 2, can also be joined to each other with a covalent bond to form a cyclic structure comprising the metal M. (R') groups of this latter type are, for example, 1,4-tetra-methylene, ethylenedioxide or malonate groups.<br>
The R' groups (II) preferably represent a radical selected from chloride, methyl, benzyl and diethylamine.<br>
In a particularly preferred form the R' groups are the same as each other.<br>
According to the present invention, the Cp group in formula (II) is an anion containing an ri-cyclopentadienly ring which preferably derives (formally by the extraction of a H" ion) from a molecule of cyclopentadiene, indene or fluorene, or<br><br>
from a derivative of one of the above compounds, in which one or more carbon atoms of the molecular skeleton (included or not included in the cyclopentadienly ring) are substituted with C,-Cs alkyl or silylalkyl groups, or Cg-C,o aiyl or aryloxy groups or C,-Cj alkoxyl groups. This Cp group can also be condensed with one or more other aromatic rings as in the case, for example, of 4,5-benzoindenyl. Typical but non-limiting examples of these Cp groups are cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl groups and the corresponding methyl-substituted groups.<br>
As previously defined, R" in formula (II) can represent either a group included in the above definition of R' or, and preferably, a group included in the above defintion of Cp. In this latter case R" can indifferently be a cyclopentadienyl anion the same as or different from Cp.<br>
When "x" = 1, the R" group is linked to the Cp group by the bridge R'", in which case it evidently represents a group included in the definition of R' or Cp respectively, but having a position substituted by the bond with the bridge R'".<br>
Metallocenes having the above formula (II) are generally known in the art and can be prepared with one of the usual methods suitable for the case, described in synthesis handbooks of organometallic compounds, or in the vast patent literature relating to the use of metallocenes in the polymerization of olefins, which is generally used as reference.<br>
As already mentioned, the metallocene derivatives (A) of the present invention can be obtained by extraction reactions of a group sigma-bonded to the metal M in a compound having the previous formula (II). These reactions are preferably carried out in an inert liquid medium, preferably hydrocarbon, and are normally carried out by putting a compound having formula (II) in contact with a suitable co-catalyst (C) capable of activating the formation of the cationic species.<br>
Examples of these reactions are qualitatively summarized in the list below, which however does not limit the overall scope of the present invention:<br><br>
i)       by pre-reacting a metallocene having the above formula (II) with an alkylating agent, preferably an aluminium trialkyl,    in   a   molar excess 5-50/1, followed by the reaction, in an almost stoichiometric ratio with the metal    M,    with    a    strong    Lewis    acid    such    as,    for    example tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, or with an ionic compound whose cation is capable of extracting one of the groups R' or R" and forming a neutral compound, and whose anion is non-co-ordinating; ii)     by a reaction according to previous item i),  without pre-reacting an alkylating agent, when at least one R' or R" group of the metallocene having the above formula (II), is alkyl or alkylene, iii)      by the reaction of a metallocene having the above formula  (II)   with   a molar   excess,   preferably   5-50/1    of   an   aluminium   trialkyl   or   an alkylaluminium halide definible with the formula AlR2Xj., wherein R is a C|-Cg alkyl group, linear or branched, or a mixture thereof, X is a halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine, and "m" is a decimal number comprised between 1 and 3;<br>

Component (B) of the catalyst of the present invention consists of a weakly co-ordinating, aprotic polar compound. These compounds are characterized by a high polarity of the molecule and consequently by a high dielectric constant , preferably equal to or higher than 3.0, more preferably equal to or higher than 4.0. They must also have a relatively low co-ordinating capacity.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the co-ordinating capacity of a chemical compound is defined as specified in the publication of V. Guttmann "Coordination Chemistry Review", vol. 18 (1976), pages 229-231, whose contents are included herein as reference. In particular, the co-ordinating capacity of a compound B (also called "donicity", DN) is defined by the equation:<br>
•B	"BSbClS<br>
wherein Hesbcj is the molar enthalpy expressed in kcal, measured by the interaction of B with ShO in a very dilute solution of dichloroethane.<br>
A compound suitable for use as component (B) according to the present<br><br>
invention should preferably have a co-ordinating capacity DN equal to or less than 10 kcal/mole, more preferably equal to or less than 5.0 kcal/mole.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention it is preferable that the contact between (A) and (B) gives rise only to reversible physical or chemical interactions.<br>

Component (B) of the present invention preferably consists of a monomeric compound having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, or a mixture of these compounds, although polymeric compounds also having more than 30 carbon atoms are not excluded from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preferred components (B) are organic compounds containing at least one heteroatom selected from O, N, P or S which have a co-ordinating capacity DN of less than 5 kcal/mole. Particularly preferred (B) components are the organic compound containing 0, N, P or S atom(s) bonded to at least one fluorinated carbon atom or to a fluorinated aromatic ring. Also preferred are fluorinated heteroaromatic compounds.<br>
Typical but non-limiting examples of compounds which can be used as component (B) in the present invention are:<br>
halogenated ethers such as 3-perfluorohexyl-l,2-epoxypropane,<br>
3-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropoxy)-l,2-epoxypropane, 2-trifluoromethyltetra-<br>

methylether,	l,l,2-trifluoro-2-chloroethyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethylether.<br><br>
2,2,2-trifluoroethylethylether,	2,2,2-trifluoroethyltriethylether,<br>
2,5-difluorotetrahydrofuran,	2,2,2-trifluoroethyltrimethyIsilylether,<br>
2,2,2-trifluoroethyltriphenylsilylether, 2-methoxy-1,1,1 -trifluoropropane, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxycyclohexane, pentafluoroanisol, 2-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydropyrane;<br>
halogenated        weak        amines        such        as        pentafluoropyridine,<br>
perfluoro-N-methylmorpholine, N-trifluoromethylpyrrole;<br>
sterically hindered and/or electronically stabilized amines or ethers such as<br>
2,6-di-t-butylpyridine,	1,3-dimethoxybenzene,        2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-<br>
tetrahydrofuran, 2,5-di-t-butyltetrahydrofuran.<br>
The moles of component (B) in the catalyst of the present invention are normally in excess with respect to the gram-atom weight of the transitions metal or lanthanide of the metallocene derivative. The ratio between the moles of (B) and the moles of the metallocene is preferably between 2 and 10,000, more preferably between 20 and 500.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can be prepared by simply putting the two components (A) and (B) in contact in the desired proportions. The temperature is not generally critical, within the limits in which the two components have sutFicient stability. The contact preferably takes place at temperatures of between room temperature and the polymerization temperature.<br>
The contact between (A) and (B) is preferably carried out in an inert liquid medium in which at least component (B) is soluble. This liquid medium can be the same polymerization solvent, if used, or also a monomer to be polymerized. Preferred liquid mediums are the hydrocarbon solvents normally used in the polymerization of olefins such as, for example, hexane, heptane, toluene, etc.<br>
Components (A) and (B) are preferably put in contact with each other at the beginning of the polymerization, for a time at least equal to the minimum period<br><br>
necessary to complete the desired activation of component (A). This period is normally between 20 seconds and 15 minutes, depending on the respective nature of the two components. The contact between the two components (A) and (B) can obviously be prolonged beyond this period without any inconvenience, and therefore the catalyst of the present invention can be transported or stored until the moment of use without any particular drawback, provided the precautions and regulations normally required for a satisfactory conservation of component (A) alone, are observed.<br>
Besides components (A) and (B), the catalyst of the present invention can comprise, if necessary or desirable, all the other known components which are normally considered appropriate in a process for the polymerization of alpha-olefms wherein the component (A) as such is used as catalyst.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can be used in the (co)polymerization of olefins to give linear polymers having different characteristics as a function of the olefin(s) which is (co)polymerized and the process conditions. Alpha-olefins which can be polymerized with the catalysts of the present invention preferably contain from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and can also comprise heteroatoms. The present catalyst can preferably be used in homo- and co-polymerization processes of 1-alkenes such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 4-methylpentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, etc., to give amorphous or crystalline polymers with a high molecular weight or also of a lower molecular weight, when desired, the polymerization being carried out under suitable conditions for the purpose, normally known in the art.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can be used with excellent results in the polymerization of ethylene to give linear polyethylene and in the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene or higher alpha-olefins to give copolymers having different characteristics depending on the specific polymerization conditions and the quantity and structure of the alpha-olefin itself<br><br>
used as comonomer. The catalyst of the present invention can also be conveniently used for the terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene and a diene to obtain vulcanizable rubbers of the EPDM type.<br>
When the component (A) is suitably structured for the aim, the present catalysts can also be advantageously used for the stereoselective polymerization of alpha-olefms, preferably containing from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, to obtain iso- or syndiotactic polyolefins with a high stereospecificity. The iso- or syndio-tactic orientation essentially depends on the structure of the alpha-olefm which is polymerized. For example, isotactic polymers of propylene (isotactic polypropylene) and 1-butene (isotactic poly-1-butene) and syndiotactic polymers of styrene and its homologous substitutes, are obtained.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can be used with excellent results in essentially all known polymerization processes of alpha-olefms, and particularly in processes in suspension, at low, medium or high pressure and at temperatures of between 50 and 240°C, or in processes in solution in an inert diluent operating normally at pressures of between 10 and 150 bars and temperatures of between 50 and 230°C. Hydrogen is usually used as molecular weight regulator. Preferably the catalyst of the present invention is used in polymerization processes at temperatures comprised between 50 an 140 °C.<br>
In all cases, the catalysts of the present invention are characterized by a notable increase in activity with respect to that which can obtained with component (A) alone, without the addition of the weak co-ordinating polar compound (B). Increases in productivity even up to fifteen times greater than that of component (A) alone under the same conditions are surprisingly obtained with the improved catalysts of the present invention. Although not being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the higher activity with respect to component (A) alone may derive both form an activating and stabilizing effect of component (B).<br><br>
According to a particular aspect of the present invention, the improved catalyst for the (co)polymerization of alpha-olefms is prepared separately in accordance with one of the methods mentioned above, and subsequently introduced into the polymerization environment. The catalyst can be charged first into the polymerization reactor followed by the reagent mixture containing the alpha-olefin and possible comonomers, or the catalyst can be charged in the reactor already containing the reagent mixture, or, finally, the reagent mixture and the catalyst can be fed contemporaneously into a continuous reactor.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the catalyst is formed in situ in the polymerization reactor, for example by charging components (A) and (B) separately from each other in the appropriate proportions and possibly in the presence of an inert solvent.<br>
According to the present invention, component (B) can also be fed to the reactor mixed with the stream containing the monomer, component (A) being fed separately.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the (co)polymerization of alpha-olefins, in the absence of organo-oxygenated compounds of metals of groups 13 or 14 of the Periodic Table of Elements, comprising feeding said alpha-olefin and optional co-monomers to a reactor, and (co)polymerizing the mixture at a temperature of from 50 to 240°C, in the presence of a polymerization catalyst wherein said catalyst comprises the following components in contact with each other: (A) an ionic metallocene compound of a metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium and hafnium, wherein said compound has a cation and an anion, and wherein said metal is included in the cation, and wherein said compound has the property itself of promoting the polymerization of olefins without organo-oxygenated compounds of metals of groups 13 or 14 of the periodic table of<br><br>
elements, (B) a substance not containing metal atoms, and containing at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P and S, characterized in that this substance (B) consists of an aprotic polar compound having a dielectric constant greater than or equal to 3 and co-ordinating capacity DN less than or equal to 10 kcal/mole; wherein the ratio between the moles of said substance of component (B) and the gram-atoms of titanium, zirconium or hafnium in component (A) is between 2 and 10,000.<br>

0,46 ml of a 1.8 M solution of aluminium ethyldichloride in toluene (AlEtCl2, 0.8 mmoles, commercial product ALDRICH) are added to a solution obtained by dissolving 25.8 mg of bis(ri -cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride (commercial product ALDRICH, 0.1 mmoles), purified by sublimation, in 15 ml of anhydrous toluene, and the mixture is left under stirring for 10 minutes at room temperature; a solution is obtained which is initially orange and subsequently darkens to brownish colour (component A).<br><br>
0.6 ml of pentafluoroanisol (PFA, commercial product ALDRICH, 25 mmoles, component B) previously distilled on calcium hydride are then added and the mixture is left under stirring for a further 10 minutes at room temperature; an olive-green solution of the desired catalyst is obtained (molar ratios Al/Ti/PFA=8/l/40), which is maintained under an inert atmosphere.<br>
100 ml of toluene are charged into a 250 ml tailed test-tube in a nitrogen atmosphere, previously deaerated by vacuum/nitrogen repeated three times.

The polymerization is carried out for 10 minutes, continuously feeding ethylene to maintain the pressure constant at 101 kPa. The polymer is recovered by precipitation in acidified methanol and subsequent washings with acetone. After drying in a stream of air at room temperature for 24 hours, 0.44 g of polyethylene are obtained, with a catalytic activity of 86 gpg/(mmole2,* 100 kPa(„,y|j,j*h). EXAMPLE 2 (comparative)<br>

8.6 ml of a toluene solution containing 26,4 mg of tris-(pentafluorophenyl)boron (0.052 mmoles) are then added to the same suspension, and a limpid green solution is rapidly obtained (component A).<br>
1.75 ml of PFA (12.5 mmoles, component B), previously distilled on calcium hydride, are then added to the green solution and the mixture is left under stirring for a further 10 minutes at room temperature; a pink-coloured solution of the desired catalyst is obtained (molar ratios Al/Zr/PFA = 10/1/240), which is maintained under an inert atmosphere.<br>
A BUCHI autoclave with a one litre glass reactor, equipped with a propeller stirrer, thermocouple and thermostatic jacket, is preliminarily maintained under vacuum for two hours and subsequently filled with nitrogen. The same operation of vacuum/nitrogen is repeated twice. 500 ml of anhydrous toluene (distilled on metallic sodium) are then introduced and ethylene is pumped in up to a pressure of 202 kPa (2 atm). The temperature is brought to 70°C. The autoclave is depressurized and 15.1 ml of the catalyst solution prepared as above are charged, under ethylene flow (0.024 mmole of Zr).
