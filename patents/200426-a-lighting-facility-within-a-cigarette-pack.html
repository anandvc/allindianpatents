				<td>This Invention relates to "A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK".<br>
The major problem that the smokers across the world have been facing is non-availability of a composite cigarette-cum-match box. As normally these are two different units, many a times it so happens that a person has a cigarette but has to depend on others either for a match box or a lighter, which puts him in an very  embarassing or akward position. This invention aims at overcoming this drawback and provides an ideal lighting facility within the compact cigarette pack.<br>
This Invention "A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK", has a provision for lighting a cigarette, incorporated<br>
within a cigarette pack.  The details of this invention is explained herein with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
EXAMPLE : 1 WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWING SHEET N0:1<br>
Figure (1) represents a cigarette pack with the top cover (b) open and showing the position of the match sticks (c), intact.  The incorporation of the match sticks within the pack, does not call for any alteration in the design of the cigarette pack and could be accomodated within the pack, as it is.  Figure (2) of the accompanying drawing gives another view of the match sticks, which is in the position of "Ready to Use".<br><br>
This Invention "A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK" is arrived at , by opening the top cover of the cigarette pack and inserting the match sticks within the inner surface of the top cover.  The edge of the top cover is folded and is in the form of a beading.  The folded inner surface of the top cover is stretched out, glue applied on to it and the match sticks arranged in a queue, one after the other, vertically in such a manner that the stretched inner surface of the top cover, when put back in position, the match heads are on the top.  Once this assembly is made and the top cover of the pack is closed, it does not alter the position of the cigarettes within the pack, nor does it result in a 'bulge', as normally viewed.  Further, as the match sticks are embedded within the inner surface of the top cover, the match sticks are concealed when the top cover is closed and as such is not exposed to the atmosphere, consequent to which it is weatherproof and also it is not at all hazardous from the safety point of view.<br>
EXAMPLE : 2 WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWING SHEET NO: 2<br>
Example (2) is with reference to the Drawing Sheet No:2, which relates to another type of cigarette pack available in the market.  In this case, the cigarette pack is in two pieces and the inner piece (b) in which the cigarettes are placed can just be pulled out of the body (a) and the top end carries an extension, which is just folded and rests above the foil<br><br>
separating the cigarettes and the inner surface of the body (a) In this case, glue is applied on the outter surface of the extension of the inner surface (b) and match sticks (c) are fixed one after the another, in the form of a queue and when the pack is in the assembled condition, the match heads point towards the downward direction, as shown in fig (2). Similarly, even in this case, a silver paper or foil separates the cigarettes and the match sticks, there are no chances of any hazards.<br>
In the same lines, suitable arrangements can be made for positioning of the match sticks, depending upon the design and the structure of the cigarette pack.  The above two examples pertain to the two most common types of cigarette packs availa-lable in the market.  Concept being essence of the invention, positioning of the match sticks could be varied to suit the requi rement.<br>
Generally all Cigarette Manufacturers take care to ensure that the cigarettes within the pack are covered by a silver paper or any other appropriate paper or foil. This has come as a sort of 'blessing in disguise' for this Invention, as it separates the cigarettes from the match sticks thereby ensuring that the match heads are not in direct contact with the cigarette tips, ruling out any hazard, though chances of such occurances are Mery  minimal.<br>
For an advantageous assembly of the match sticks, it is<br><br>
preferred to go in for either wax coated sticks or sticks which have a horizontal cross-section alongwith a horizontal tip for lighting. This ensures that the cigarette pack does not bulge even to a minimum extent when the match sticks are assembled with in the top cover, as enumerated above.  Normally, the number of match sticks is equivalent to the number of cigarettes that the cigarette pack carries. For instance, a cigarette pack carrying 10 cigarettes shall carry 10 match sticks.<br>
A striking surface (d) is provided on the face of the cigarette pack as shown in figure (1) and figure (2) of the accompanying drawings.  (a) of the accompanying drawings represents body of the pack, (b) the flexible portion and (c) the match sticks.  The striking surface (d) is glued to the front surface of the cigarette pack, as shown in the figure, which is the best position for 'easy strike*. The main advantage of 'A Lighting facility within a cigarette pack' is that it does not call for any modification or alte-ration of the existing pack and makes the best use of the facilities, as it is.  As such, cigarette manufacturers need not go in for any changes in their manufacturing infrastructure and this incorporation is an added advantage. Thus, this Invention "A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK" offers an ideal cigarette pack, which along with it carries a lighting facility and one need not look in for either a match box or a lighter and thus is a "two-in-one".<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM,<br>
1)	"A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK"<br>
wherein Match Sticks (c) are accomodated within the body of a Cigarette Pack (a); match sticks being embedded by glue to the flexible portion (b) of the cigarette pack; when assembled, the profile is as shown in Fig (1) of accompanying Drawing Sheet No:l and Fig (2) of accompanying Drawing Sheet No:2, are compactly placed and positioned safely, a silver paper or foil separating the cigarettes and the match sticks, concealing the match sticks from external atmosphere, consequently being weather-proof and the provision of a striking surface (d) for the match sticks on the face of the body of the cigarette pack, as shown in the accompanying drawings.<br>
2)	"A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK"<br>
as claimed above, wherein the match sticks are either wax-coated ones or those which have a horizontal cross-section with a horizontal tip for lighting, being most suitable for accomodation within the pack.<br>
3)	"A LIGHTING FACILITY WITHIN A CIGARETTE PACK"<br>
as claimed in Claims (1) &amp; (2) and as substantially explained herein with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
