				<td>ULTRAHIGH-STRENGTH HOT-ROLLED STEEL AND METHOD OF<br>
PRODUCING BANDS<br>
The present invention relates to an ultrahigh-strength<br>
hot-rolled steel and to a process for manufacturing<br>
strip from this steel, the structure of which is of the<br>
bainite-martensite type and may contain up to 5%<br>
ferrite.<br>
Ultrahigh-strength steels have been developed in recent<br>
years, especially so as to meet the specific<br>
requirements of the automobile industry, which are in<br>
particular to reduce the weight, and therefore the<br>
thickness, of parts and to improve safety, by<br>
increasing the fatigue strength and impact behavior of<br>
the parts. These improvements must also not degrade the<br>
formability of the sheets used to manufacture the<br>
parts.<br>
This formability assumes that the steel has a high<br>
elongation A (greater than 10%) and a yield strength E<br>
to tensile strength Rm ratio of low value.<br>
The improvement in the impact behavior of the formed<br>
parts may be carried out in various ways and, in<br>
particular, using steels possessing, on the one hand, a<br>
high elongation A and, on the other hand, an E/Rm ratio<br>
of low value, thereby making it possible, after forming<br>
and thanks to the consolidation capacity of the steel,<br>
to increase its yield strength.<br>
The fatigue behavior of the parts defines their<br>
lifetime on the basis of the stresses to which they are<br>
subjected, and this may be improved by increasing the<br>
tensile strength Rm of the steel. However, increasing<br>
the tensile strength reduces the formability of the<br>
steel, thus limiting the parts that can be produced, in<br>
particular as regards their thickness.<br>
The term "ultrahigh-strength steel" is understood<br>
within the context of the present invention to mean a<br>
steel whose tensile strength Rm is greater than<br>
800 MPa.<br>
A first family of ultrahigh-strength steels is known,<br>
these being steels containing high proportions of<br>
carbon (more than 0.1%) and of manganese (more than<br>
1.2%), the structure of the steels being entirely<br>
martensitic. They have a tensile strength of greater<br>
than 1000 MPa, obtained by a hardening heat treatment,<br>
but they have an elongation A of less than 8%, which<br>
precludes any forming operation.<br>
A second family of ultrahigh-strength steels consists<br>
of what are called dual-phase steels, having a<br>
structure consisting of about 10% ferrite and 90%<br>
martensite. These steels exhibit very good formability,<br>
but with tensile strength levels not exceeding 800 MPa.<br>
The object of the present invention is to remedy the<br>
drawbacks of the steels of the prior art by proposing<br>
an ultrahigh-strength hot-rolled steel, capable of<br>
being formed and exhibiting improved fatigue behavior<br>
and impact behavior.<br>
For this purpose, the first subject of the invention is<br>
an ultrahigh-strength hot-rolled steel, characterized<br>
in that its chemical composition comprises, by weight:<br>
0.05% = C = 0.1%<br>
0.7% = Mn = 1.1%<br>
0.5% = Cr = 1.0%<br>
0.05% = Si = 0.3%<br>
0.05 = Ti = 0.1%<br>
Al = 0.07%<br>
S = 0.03%<br>
P = 0.05%<br>
the balance being iron and impurities resulting from<br>
the smelting, said steel having a bainite-martensite<br>
structure that may contain up to 5% ferrite.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the chemical composition<br>
furthermore comprises, by weight:<br>
0.08% = C = 0.09%<br>
0.8% = Mn = 1.0%<br>
0.6% = Cr = 0.9%<br>
0.2% = Si = 0.3%<br>
0.05% = Ti = 0.09%<br>
Al = 0.07%<br>
S = 0.03%<br>
P = 0.05%<br>
the balance being iron and impurities resulting from<br>
the smelting.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the structure of the<br>
steel according to the invention consists of 70 to 90%<br>
bainite, 10 to 30% martensite and 0 to 5% ferrite, and<br>
more particularly preferably of 70 to 85% bainite, 15<br>
to 30% martensite and 0 to 5% ferrite.<br>
The steel according to the invention may also have the<br>
following features, taken individually or in<br>
combination:<br>
- a tensile strength Rm of 950 MPa or higher;<br>
- an elongation at break A of 10% or higher;<br>
- a yield strength E of 680 MPa or higher; and<br>
- an E/Rm ratio of less than 0.8.<br>
The second subject of the invention is a process for<br>
manufacturing a strip of ultrahigh-strength hot-rolled<br>
steel according to the invention, in which a slab,<br>
whose composition comprises:<br>
0.05% = C = 0.1%<br>
0.7% = Mn = 1.1%<br>
0.5% = Cr = 1.0%<br>
0.05% = Si = 0.3%<br>
0.05 = Ti = 0.1%<br>
Al = 0.07%<br>
S = 0.03%<br>
P = 0.05%,<br>
the balance being iron and impurities resulting from<br>
the smelting, is hot-rolled, the rolling temperature<br>
being below 950°C, then the strip thus obtained is<br>
cooled down to a temperature of 400°C or below,<br>
maintaining a cooling rate of greater than 50°C/s<br>
between 800 and 700°C, and then said strip is coiled at<br>
a coiling temperature of 250°C or below.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the slab<br>
is the following:<br>
0.08% = C = 0.09%<br>
0.8% = Mn = 1.0%<br>
0.6% = Cr = 0.9%<br>
0.2% = Si = 0.3%<br>
0.05% = Ti = 0.09%<br>
Al = 0.07%<br>
S = 0.03%<br>
P = 0.05%<br>
the balance being iron and impurities resulting from<br>
the smelting.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the hot-rolled steel<br>
strip is coated with zinc or a zinc alloy, by dipping<br>
it into a bath of molten zinc or zinc alloy following<br>
the coiling operation and after having been uncoiled,<br>
and then annealed.<br>
The process according to the invention firstly consists<br>
in hot-rolling a slab of specific composition, so as to<br>
obtain a uniform structure. The rolling temperature is<br>
below 950°C, preferably below 900°C.<br>
After the rolling operation, the strip thus obtained is<br>
cooled down to a temperature of 400°C or below,<br>
maintaining a cooling rate of greater than 50°C/s<br>
between 800 and 700°C. This rapid cooling is carried<br>
out in such a way that less than 5% ferrite forms, the<br>
presence of ferrite being undesirable as titanium would<br>
preferentially precipitate in this phase. The above<br>
cooling rate is preferably between 50°C/s and 200°C/s.<br>
Next, the process consists in coiling the strip at a<br>
coiling temperature of 250°C or below. The temperature<br>
of this step is limited so as to prevent tempering of<br>
the martensite, which would reduce the mechanical<br>
strength and would raise the yield strength, hence<br>
giving a poor E/Rm ratio.<br>
The composition according to the invention contains<br>
carbon with a content of between 0.05% and 0.100%. This<br>
element is essential for obtaining good mechanical<br>
properties, but it must not be present in an<br>
excessively large amount, as it could generate<br>
segregation. A carbon content of less than 0.100 makes<br>
it possible in particular to achieve; good weldability,<br>
and an improvement in the forming and endurance limit<br>
properties.<br>
The composition also contains manganese with a content<br>
of between 0.7% and 1.1%. Manganese improves the yield<br>
strength of the steel, while greatly reducing its<br>
ductility, and so its content is limited. A content of<br>
less than 1.1% also prevents any segregation during<br>
continuous casting.<br>
The composition also contains chromium with a content<br>
of between 0.50% and 1.0%. A minimum content of 0.50%<br>
favors the appearance of bainite in the microstructure.<br>
However, its content is limited to 1.0% since a high<br>
chromium content would increase the amount of ferrite<br>
formed to greater than 5%, because of its ability to<br>
induce the alpha-phase.<br>
The composition also contains silicon with a content of<br>
between 0.05% and 0.3%. Silicon greatly improves the<br>
yield strength of the steel, while slightly reducing<br>
its ductility and degrading its coatability, which<br>
explains why its content is limited.<br>
The composition also contains titanium with a content<br>
of between 0.05 and 0.1%. This element allows the<br>
mechanical properties to be substantially improved by a<br>
precipitation effect during the rolling and cooling<br>
steps. It does not increase the hot hardness because of<br>
its moderate content. Its content is limited to 0.1% in<br>
order to avoid degrading the impact strength<br>
properties, the hot hardness and the bendability.<br>
The composition may also contain phosphorus with a<br>
content of less than 0.05%, as beyond this it would<br>
pose segregation problems during continuous casting.<br>
The composition also contains aluminum with a content<br>
of less than 0.07%, which is introduced when killing<br>
the steel during smelting in the steelworks.<br>
Examples<br>
By way of nonlimiting example, and so as to better<br>
illustrate the invention, a grade of steel was smelted.<br>
Its composition is given in the table below:<br>
The balance of the composition consists of iron and<br>
inevitable impurities resulting from the smelting.<br>
Abbreviations employed<br>
Rm: tensile strength in MPa;<br>
Rp0.2: yield strength in MPa;<br>
A: elongation, measured in %.<br>
Three specimens were prepared from grade A, by rolling<br>
them at 860°C and then subjecting them to different<br>
thermomechanical pathways. The cooling rates between<br>
800 and 700°C and the coiling temperature were varied,<br>
so as to bring out the structural differences obtained.<br>
Next, the mechanical properties of the steels obtained<br>
were measured. The results are given in the table<br>
below:<br>
* according to the invention.<br>
The microstructure of trial 1, according to the<br>
invention, was of bainite-martensite type, while the<br>
microstructure of trials 2 and 3 was of ferrite-bainite<br>
type.<br>
The table shows that a cooling rate between 800 and<br>
700°C of less than 50°C/s causes ferrite to be present<br>
in a proportion of greater than 5%. Titanium then<br>
precipitates in this ferrite, this no longer making it<br>
possible to achieve the desired level of mechanical<br>
properties, in particular a high Rm.<br>
Moreover, a coiling temperature above 250°C, combined<br>
with a cooling rate between 800 and 700°C of less than<br>
50°C/s, increases the yield strength without increasing<br>
the tensile strength. The E/Rm ratio is therefore too<br>
high.<br>
Finally, the table shows that a cooling rate between<br>
800 and 700°C of greater than 50°C/s combined with a<br>
coiling temperature below 250°C gives excellent tensile<br>
strength and yield strength values. The essentially<br>
bainite-martensitic structure gives the product a good<br>
E/Rm ratio and an elongation of greater than 10%.<br>
Furthermore, the steel according to the invention<br>
exhibits good coatability by dipping in a bath of<br>
molten metal, such as zinc or a zinc alloy, or aluminum<br>
or one of its alloys.<br>
