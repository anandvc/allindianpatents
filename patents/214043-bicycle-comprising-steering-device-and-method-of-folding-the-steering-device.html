[Prior Art]<br>
Use of bicycles such as motor-assisted bicycles has been widened, and, in some cases, the bicycle is transported by a private vehicle or the like to a resort or a shopping center, where the bicycle is used.  In such a case, it is desirable that the bicycle can be folded up into an easily transportable form.  For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. Shoe 52-30048 discloses a bicycle in which a handle projecting upward from a handle post can be folded up along the front-rear direction of the vehicle, for convenience of transportation or storage.  In this bicycle, the handle is set along the vehicle body by turning the handle with the handle post as a pivot, and is then folded by swirling it with a support portion (lug) at the upper end of the handle post as a center. [0003] [Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the bicycle described in the publication, where the length from the lug to the top end of the handle is large, the locus of the upper end of the handle at the time of folding the handle stretches out largely in the vehicle body width direction.  Therefore, a large space is required for folding up the bicycle, so that use may be limited.<br><br>

Thus, the rotation of the motor M is transmitted to the composite gear 31 through the pinion 29 and the assist gear 32, whereas a tread force inputted from the crank shaft 11 is transmitted to the composite gear 31 through the tread force input gear.  Then, the tread force and the assisting power are united with each other by the composite gear 31, and the united power is transmitted to the driving sprocket 33, and is further transmitted to the rear wheel WR through the driven sprocket 332.  A controller 37 disposed at a front portion inside the case 70 controls the rotation of the motor M based on a tread force value inputted from a tread force detecting means which is not shown. [0032]<br>
A pivot 36 for turnably supporting a main stand 35 consisting of a cast aluminum product is fitted to a rear lower portion of the main body case 70 .  A projection 70c provided at the lower end of the main body case 70 is a leg portion for self-standing of a rear portion of the bicycle inclusive of the rear frame 23 when the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23 are separated from each other, and when the rear portion is placed on the ground, the rear portion can self-stand with the projection 70c and the rear wheel WR.<br>

[0033]<br>
A lock pin 39 having a lock lever 38 is inserted through bosses 28, 28 provided at the front end of the rear frame 23.  A bolt 391 is provided so as to be turnable with the lock pin 39 as a center, and a nut 3 is mated with the bolt 391.  The bolt 391 is passed through a groove (for detailed shape, see FIGS. 9 to 12J of an engaging portion 40   formed to be projected outward from the front frame 22, and one   surface of a nut 392 makes contact with the engaging portion 40 to constitute a fastening surface.<br>
[0034]<br>
A central portion of the lock pin 39 to which the bolt 3 91 is fitted is eccentric with respect to the hole of the boss 28, and by turning the lock lever 38, the contact strength between the nut 392 and the engaging portion 40 is adjusted.  The maximum of the contact strength between the fastening surface of the nut 3 92 and the engaging portion 4 0 can be determined by the amount of turning of the nut 392.  In the condition where the lock lever 38 is turned to a position along the rear frame 2 3 as shown in the figure, the nut 392 and the engaging portion 4 0 makes strong contact with each other, and the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23 are strongly<br>
24<br><br>
connected   to   each  other.<br>
[0035]<br>
On the other hand, when the lock lever 38 is turned in the direction away from the rear frame 2 3, namely, toward the direction orthogonal to the vehicle body, the nut 392 is deviated in the direction away from the engaging portion 40 (toward the front side of the vehicle body) by a distance according to the amount of eccentricity due to the eccentric shape of the lock pin 3 9, whereby the contact strength between the nut 392 and the engaging portion 40   is   weakened.  When the bolt 391 is turned with the lock pin 39 as a shaft under the condition where the contact strength is weakened, the engagement between the nut 3 92 and the engaging portion 40 can be released, and the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23 can be folded with the hinge 24 as a center.<br>
[0036]<br>

26<br><br>
in FIG. 8 shows the condition where the lid 162 is opened. With the box main body 161 so disposed that its longitudinal direction coincides with the front-rear direction of the vehicle body, the frontage of the open upper side is larger as compared with the case where the longitudinal direction is roughly perpendicular to the front-rear direction, so that fitting and detaching of the battery 41 is facilitated.<br>
[0038]<br>
The lid 162 is provided with a window 48 so that the indicator 42 can be looked through, and is provided with a key device 54.  The key device 54 has a claw 541 which can be let in and out by turning a key (preferably used in common with the key for operating the power source switch), and the claw 541 is engaged with the upper end of the box main body 161, whereby locking is achieved.<br>
[0039]<br>
The battery 41 is contained in the box main body 161, and a terminal box 164 is provided at a bottom portion of the box main body 161.  Terminals 49, 49 to be connected to the terminals 47, 47 on the side of the battery 41 are contained in the terminal box 164.  The terminals 49, 49 are connected to the controller 37<br>
27<br><br>
through a cable not shown.  At an upper portion of the box main boxy 161, a U-shaped member 46 is provided so as to protrude sideways from a cutout formed at an edge of the lid 162.  The U-shaped member 46 is used as a receiving means for holding the lock lever 38 at a position along the rear frame 23.<br>
[0040]<br>
A lock arm 51 for holding the battery 41 in the battery box 16 is provided at a portion on the rear side of the vehicle body, of the box main body 161.  The lock arm 51 is pivotally supported on the box main boxy 161 by use of a pin 52 so as to be capable of tilting in the front-rear direction of the vehicle body.

The lock arm 51 extends upward from the pin 52, and its tip end fronts on the inside of the box main body 161 through an inside wall at a double wall portion. The position and shape of the lock arm 51 are so set that its tip end protruding to the side of the battery 41 is fitted in a recessed portion RS of the case 412 of the battery 41.<br>
[0041]<br>
A drooping piece 53 is fitted to or formed<br>
28<br><br>
integrally with an edge on the rear side of the vehicle body, of the lid 162 .  The. position and shape of the drooping piece 53 are so set that it is inserted between the back (a surface on the rear side of the vehicle body) of the lock arm 51 and an outside wall of the double wall to apply a pressing force to the back in the condition where the lid 162 is closed, and a space for allowing the lock arm 51 to tilt in the direction of the outside wall is generated in the condition where the lid 162 is opened.<br>
[0042]<br>
In FIG. 8, of the wires 831, 832 disposed through a lower portion of the battery box 16, the speed change gear wire 831 extends rearwards in a space surrounded by the rear frame 23 along the right portion 23R of the rear frame 2 3, whereas the rear brake wire 832 is deviated to the side of the left portion 23L of the rear frame 23 at its intermediate portion and extends rearwards along the left portion 23L.<br>
[0043]<br>
Next, the hinge 24 for connecting the front frame 2 2 and the rear frame 23 will be described in detail.  FIG. 9 is a sectional plan view of a rear end portion of the front frame 22 including the hinge 24, and FIG. 10 is a front view (a view from the rear side of the vehicle<br>
29<br><br>
body) of the same.  The rear end portion can be constituted of a rear end component (hereinafter referred to as "end block") integrated by welding to a pipe-shaped component constituting the front frame 2 2.  In both figures, the end block 45 is provided with a hook 451, and the size and position of the hook 451 are so set that it is fitted between the bosses 241, 241 provided on the rear frame 23 and can be engaged with the pivot pin 242. [0044]<br>
A lock plate 452 is provided so as to shut off an opening portion {cutout portion) of the U-shaped hook 451. The lock plate 452 is pivotally supported on the end block 45 by a pin 453.  Further, the end block 45 is provided with an   operating lever 4 55 pivotally supported by a spring pin 454.  The operating lever 455 includes an operating portion 455a onto which a finger is pressed, and a hook 455b.  The operating lever 455 is connected to the lock plate 4 52 by a tension spring 456, whereas the hook 4 5 5b fronts on the face side of the lock plate 452, namely, on the side of the rear frame 2 3 from a cutout window 452a formed in the lock plate 452 and is engaged with the frame of the cutout window 452a.  With the hook 455b engaged with the lock plate 452, the turning of the lock plate 452 in the direction of arrow R is restricted<br>
30<br><br>
although the tension spring 456 is acting.  The operating lever 4 55 has a contact portion 455c making contact with the end block 45 in the vicinity of the pivotal support portion, and the operating lever 455 is inhibited from turning in the direction of arrow RR from the position shown in the figure. [0045]<br>
With this constitution, the opening portion of the hook 451 is shut off by a tip end portion of the lock plate 452, so that the pivot pin 242 engaged with the hook 451 cannot escape from the hook 451.  Therefore, even when the lock device operated by the lock lever 38 is released, the vehicle body frame (consisting of the front frame and the rear frame) can only be folded with the pivot pin 242 as a center. [0046]<br>
To separate the vehicle body frame into the front frame 22 and the rear frame 2 3 after folding, the operating portion 455a of the operating lever 455 is pushed into the depth (direction of arrow RF) of the end block 45.  Consequently, the operating lever 455 is turned with the pin 454 as a center, and the lock plate 452 is turned with the pin 453 as a center, whereby the opening portion of the hook 451 is opened.  Therefore, the pivot<br>
31<br><br>
pin 242 can escape from the hook 451, and the vehicle body frame can be completely separated at the connecting portion between the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23.<br>
[0047]<br>
As a result of the turning of the operating lever 455 and the lock plate 452, the engagement between the hook 455b of the operating lever 455 and the lock plate 452 is released, so that the opened condition of the opening portion is maintained after the pressing on the operating lever 455 is stopped.  Therefore, the operation of pressing the operating lever 455 and the work of separating the vehicle body frame can easily be carried out stepwise by use of both hands.<br>
[0048]<br>
To re-assemble the separated vehicle body frame, the pivot pin 242 is hooked on the hook 451, and the lock plate 452 is pressed in to the side of the hook 451 to engage the hook 456b of the operating lever 455 and the lock plate 452.  By this operation, the opening portion of the hook 451 is shut off.  Subsequently, mating surfaces of the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23 are faced to each other, the nut 392 of the lock device shown in FIG. 4 is hooked on the engaging portion 40, and the lock lever 38 is turned to a position along the rear frame 23,<br>
32<br><br>
thereby locking. [0049]<br>
Next, a modified embodiment of the hinge 24 will be described.  FIG. 11 is a sectional plan view of a rear end portion of the front frame 22 according to the modified embodiment of the hinge 24, and FIG. 12 is a front view of the same, wherein the same reference numerals as those in FIGS. 9 and 10 denote the same or equivalent portions. In the figures, the pivot pin 242 fixed on the side of the rear frame 23 is engaged with the hook 451, and a lock plate 457 is provided at a position for shutting off the opening portion {cutout portion) of the hook 451 so that the pivot pin 242 cannot escape.  The lock plate 457 includes an operating portion 457a on which a finger can be hooked, and a lock portion 457b for shutting off the cutout portion, and is pivotally supported on the end block 45 through a pin 453.  A spring (torsion coil spring) 458 is engaged with the lock plate 457 so that a force is exerted in the direction for bringing the operating portion 4 57a toward the end block 4 5, namely, in the direction for spacing the lock portion 457b away from the end block 45.  Here, the rear end of the lock portion 457b, namely, an end portion 452c on the side of the operating portion 4 57a makes contact with an end face<br>
33<br><br>
of the end block 45, so that the lock plate 457 cannot be turned away from the end block 45 beyond the position where the lock portion 457b is opposed to the cutout portion. [0050]<br>
On the other hand, the end block 45 is provided with an escape portion (recessed portion) 4 59 so that the lock portion 457b can   be turned in the direction {arrow RA) toward the end block 45.  The depth of the escape portion 459 is so set that the lock portion 457b escapes to the side of the end block 45 to open the cutout portion of the hook 451. [0051]<br>
With this constitution, the lock plate 457 is urged by the spring 458 and the opening portion of the hook 4 51 is shut off by the lock portion 4 57b, so that the pivot pin 242 cannot escape from the hook 451.  Therefore, only releasing the lock device operated by the lock lever 38 results in that the vehicle body frame can   only be folded with the pivot pin 242 as a center. [0052]<br>
To separate the vehicle body frame into the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23 after folding, a finger is hooked on the operating portion 457a of the lock plate<br>
34<br><br>
457, and the operating portion 457a is pulled in the direction (direction of arrow RR) away from the end block 45.  Consequently, the lock portion 457b is retracted into the escape portion 459, and the opening portion of the hook 451 is opened.  Therefore, the pivot pin 242 can escape from the hook 451, and the vehicle body frame can be completely separated at the connecting portion between the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23. [0053]<br>
To re-assemble the separated vehicle body frame, the pivot pin 242 is pressed against the lock portion 457b so as to retract the lock portion 457b into the escape portion 459.  When the pivot pin 242 is contained in the hook 451, the pressing force of the pivot pin 242 onto the lock portion 457b is released.  As a result, the lock portion 457b is turned to the opposite side of arrow RA by the urging force of the spring 453, and the opening portion of the hook 451 is shut off. [0054]<br>
A surface of the end block 45 faced to the rear frame 2 3 is provided with a projected portion 4 0a adjacently to the groove of the engaging portion 40.  The projected portion 40a is provided at a position for engagement with a vehicle body right side wall between<br>
35<br><br>
the bosses 28 provided at a front portion of the rear frame 23.  The projected portion 40a prevents the end block 4 5 from being staggered to the right side of the vehicle body, and so acts that the pivot pin 242 is not disengaged from the hook 451 even when a trouble is generated in the lock plate 457 (anti-lock condition).<br>
[0055]<br>
In the above embodiment of the hinge 24, the pivot pin 242 is provided on   the side of the rear frame 2 3, while the hook 451 for engagement with the pivot pin 242 and the lock device including the lock plates 452, 457, the operating lever 4 55 and the like are provided on the side of the front frame 22.  However, this arrangement may be reversed; namely, the pivot pin 242 may be provided on the side of the front frame 22, and the lock plate 452 and the like may be provided on the side of the rear frame 23.<br>
[0056]<br>
Next, the joint 6 for connecting the handle post 7 to the front fork 5 will be described in detail.  FIG. 13 is a sectional plan view of the joint 6, and FIG. 14 is a perspective view of a major part.  A joint block 62 provided at a top portion of the front fork 5 is provided with a hole 62a through which a shaft 63 of a knob 61 can<br>
36<br><br>
penetrate horizontally, and a hole 62b orthogonal to the hole 62a.  The hole 62a and the hole 62b are provided with cutout grooves 62c, 62d so that the shaft 63 can be turned in a horizontal plane inside the joint block 62.<br>
[0057J<br>
A male screw 63a formed at the tip end of the shaft 63 is mated with a female screw 7a formed at the lower end of the handle post 7.  The handle post 7 is provided at its lower end with a hub 7b fitted to an end face of the joint block 62, and a projected portion 7c to be engaged with a recessed portion 62e formed at an end face of the joint block 62 to determine a direction relative to the joint block 62.  The hub 7b of the handle post 7 is fitted to the periphery of a terminal end portion of the cutout groove 62c, and a projected portion 62f having a vertical groove for engagement with the projected portion 7c is provided at the periphery.  A stopper 55 turnably supported by  a pin 6 4 is provided at a vehicle body rear side end portion of the joint block 62.<br>
[0058]<br>
An operation of folding the handle post 7 will be described.  FIGS. 15 are perspective views of the joint 6 for showing the procedures of folding.  FIG. 15(a) shows the joint 6 at the time of use of the motor - assisted<br>
37<br><br>
bicycle.  In this condition, the handle post 7 rises vertically upwards, and the lower end of the handle post 7 is fitted to the joint block 62.  To fold the handle post 7, first, the knob 61 is turned to loosen the fastening. [0059]<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 15(b), the stopper 55 is opened upwards with the pin 64 as a center, and the knob 61 is urged to the front side of the vehicle body. With the stopper 55 opened, a large space is created between the knob 61 and the joint block 62, as shown in FIG. 15(c) viewed from the side of the knob 61, and the knob 61 can be displaced to the front side of the vehicle body.  With the knob 61 displaced to the front side of the vehicle body, the projected portion 7c of the handle post 7 is disengaged from the recessed portion 62e of the joint block 62 (See FIG. 15(b)).  As a result, the shaft 63 can be turned counterclockwise in plan view (in the left direction with respect to the forward direction of the vehicle body).  FIG. 15(d) shows the condition where the shaft 63 is turned by 90 degrees. [0060]<br>
A modified embodiment of the joint 6 will be described.  FIG. 16 is a horizontal sectional view of a<br>
38<br><br>
major part of the handle post including the joint 6 according to the modified embodiment, and FIG. 17 is a vertical sectional view of the same.  In both figures, at a lower end portion 71 of the handle post {first portion) 7, a shaft 72 (eccentric shaft) for lock having both end portions supported by the lower end portion 71 and a central portion eccentric relative to the both end portions penetrates horizontally.  A lever 73 for turning the shaft 72 is connected to a protruding end of the shaft 72.  A stop ring 75 is fitted to the other end of the shaft 7 2 through a washer 74, whereby the shaft 72 is prevented from escaping from the lower end portion 71 of the handle post 7 . [0061]<br>
In addition, a bolt {shaft means) 76 extending in a direction orthogonal to the shaft 72 penetrates through the handle post 7, and one   end of the hoit   76 is turnably engaged with the central portion, namely, an eccentric portion of the shaft 72.  Further, the bolt 76 penetrates through a stem 77 as a second portion of the handle post fitted to the head pipe 21.  A nut (double nut) 7 8 is mated with a protruding portion of the bolt 76 penetrating through the stem 77.  A cap 78a made of a resin material is fitted onto the nut 78.  A stopper<br>
39<br><br>
(restricting means) 79 turnably supported by a bolt 80 erected on the stem 77 is intermediately disposed between the nut 78 and the stem 77.  The stopper 79 is normally urged in the direction for engagement with the bolt 76 by a coil spring 91 provided around a bolt 90. [0062]<br>
A head portion, namely, an upper portion of the stem 7 7 is provided with grooves corresponding to the cutout grooves 62c, 62d so that the bolt 7 6 can   be horizontally turned in the direction of arrow R by a predetermined angle.  Details will be described later.  A bolt 92 extending along the longitudinal direction of the stem 77 is provided, and a nut 93 is mated with a tip end portion of the bolt 92 protruding from the stem 77.  A cap 77a is fitted onto a top portion of the stem 77. [0063]<br>
Contact surfaces of the lower end portion of the handle post 7 and the stem 77 have recessed and projected shapes, and mutual engagement thereof is maintained at normal time.  The lever 73 can be turned by 90 degrees as shown in the figure, and, by this turning, the position of engagement of the bolt 76 with the eccentric portion of the shaft 72 is varied, and engagement strength between the lower end portion 71 of the handle post 7 and<br>
40<br><br>
the stem 77 is varied.  Positional relationship is so set that the engagement strength is maximized when the lever 73 is set in a position along the handle post 7.<br>
[0064]<br>
FIG. 18 is a front view (view from the front side of the vehicle body) of the stem 77, FIG. 19 is a left side view, and FIG. 20 is a right sectional view.  As shown in the figures, a head portion of the stem 77 is provided with a void 95 through which the bolt 7 6 penetrates.  The void 95 includes grooves or cutouts 95a, 95b so expanded that the bolt 76 can be turned by at least 9 0 degrees from the normal-use position, counterclockwise in plane view, namely, in the direction of arrow R (See FIG. 16).  With this construction, the bolt 76 can be freely turned from the normal-use position, namely, the position along the forward direction of the vehicle to the direction orthogonal to the forward direction of the vehicle, or vice versa.  At a position on the rear side of the vehicle body of the stem 77, a projection 97 for determining the limit of turning of the stopper 7 9 is provided.<br>
[0065]<br>
Next, the procedures of folding up the handle post 7 at the joint 6 according to the modified embodiment<br>
41<br><br>
will be described.  FIG. 21 is a perspective view of the joint 6 in a use condition.  As shown in the figure, in the normal-use position, the axial direction of the bolt 76 penetrating through the stem 77 coincides with the forward direction of the vehicle, and is parallel to the plane of the front wheel WF.  The lever 73 rises along the handle post 7, and the projected portion 71a of the lower end portion 71 of the handle post 7 and the recessed and projected portion 77b of the stem 77 are in firm contact engagement with each other.  Therefore, the turning of the handle post 7 by operating the handle 8 is securely transmitted to the front wheel WF through the front fork 5, whereby steering is controlled. [0066]<br>
From this normal-use condition, the handle post 7 is folded up.  FIGS. 22 to 25 are perspective views of a major part of the bicycle showing the procedures of folding the handle post 7.  First, in FIG. 22, the lever 73 is tilted from the position along the handle post 7 to a substantially horizontal position.  With the lever 73 turned to this position, the engagement between the lower portion 71 and the head portion of the stem 77 is loosened.  Then, the force restricting the turning (lift-up) of the stopper 79 between the nut 78 and the stem 77<br>
42<br><br>
is also loosened, so that the stopper 79 can be lifted up.<br>
[0067]<br>
In FIG. 22, the stopper 79 is turned with the bolt 80 as a pivot, and the bolt 76 is deviated so as to plug the gap generated as a result of the turning.  In this manner, the engagement between the lower end portion 71 of the handle post 7 and the stem 77 is released.  To hold the tip end of the lever 73, a holder 96 is fitted to the handle post 7.<br>
[0068]<br>
Subsequently, in FIG. 23, the bolt 76 is turned in the direction of arrow R along the grooves 95a, 95b, and the handle post 7 starts to be turned to the left side of the vehicle body.  Then, in FIG. 24, the handle post 7 is already turned by about 90 degrees to   the left side of the vehicle body.  Reference numeral 8R denotes a left grip of the handle 8, and a brake lever 81 is mounted in the vicinity of the left grip 8R.  Finally, in FIG. 25, the handle post 7 is already turned to the left side of the vehicle body, and the handle post 7 is folded by about 180 degrees with the bolt 76 as   a center.<br>
[0069]<br>
FIG. 26 is a side view of the vehicle body where the handle post 7 is folded up.  With the handle post 7<br>
43<br><br>
folded up as shown in the figure, the handle 8 is moved to a position substantially along the front wheel WF. [0070]<br>
When the handle 8 is turned with the bolt 76 as a center to the position along the front wheel WF, the handle post 7 and an axle projecting in the vehicle width direction from the center of the front wheel WF may in some cases interfere with each other.  In view of such a case, it is preferable that the handle post 7 can  be folded up without such interference with the projecting portion of the axle.  FIG. 27 is a sectional view taken along line D-D of FIG. 20.  As shown in the figure, to ensure that the bolt 76 can fall at the position where the handle post 7 is already turned to the left side of the vehicle body, surfaces of the grooves 95a, 95b with which the bolt 76 comes into contact in the condition of FIGS. 2 4 and 25 are provided with chamfered portions Cu, Cd, where clearance is generated between the bolt 76 and the grooves 95a, 95b.  The chamfered portions Cu, Cd are shown also in FIGS. 19 and 20.  With the bolt 76 thus tilted, the handle post 7 can be folded up in such a condition as to avoid the interference with the axle of the front wheel WF projecting in the vehicle width direction.  While the procedures of folding have been<br>
44<br><br>
described, re-assembly is naturally conducted in the reverse procedures. [0071]<br>
An example of transporting the vehicle body separated as above will be described.  FIG. 28 is a plan view showing a tray capable of being drawn into and out of a rear portion of a four-wheel automobile (here, a wagon type vehicle or an RV car is presumed), together with a motor-assisted bicycle contained in the tray, and FIG. 29 is a perspective view of the same as viewed from the front side of the automobile.  In both figures, a front frame 56 is fixed on the lower side of a rear seat 5 7 in the automobile WGN, and determines the limit of front position of the tray 58 in the automobile WGN.  An upper frame 59 is fixed in the automobile WGN on the rear side of the front frame 56, and supports shelf plates (not shown) thereon.  The tray 58, preferably made of a resin material, is disposed to be slidable in the front-rear direction of the automobile while being guided along rails not shown, in the space surrounded by the front frame 56 and the upper frame 59 .  A charger 60 for the battery 41 is held on the left side of the upper frame 5 9. [0072]<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 8 and 29, the procedures of<br>
45<br><br>
mounting the motor-assisted bicycle into the automobile for transportation will be described.  The tray 58 is drawn out to the rear side of the automobile, for easy mounting of the motor - assisted bicycle.  With the tray thus drawn out, first, the lid 162 of the battery box 16 is opened, the battery 41 is detached from the motor-assisted bicycle, and is contained at a front central portion in the tray 5 8.  Next, the clamper 233 is loosened, the seat post 3 is drawn out of the rear frame 23, and the seat post 3 and the seat 4 are separated from each other.  The seat 4 is contained at a right side of the battery 41, and the seat post 3 is contained at a right corner in the tray 58. [0073]<br>
Subsequently, the vehicle body frame is separated. Prior to the separation, the knob 61 of the joint 6 is operated, and the handle post 7 is folded up at the joint 6.  Then, the lock lever 38 is operated to release the lock of the connecting portion between the front frame 22 and the rear frame 23, and the vehicle body frame is folded up with the pivot pin 242 as a center.  After folding, the pivot pin 242 is made to escape from the hook 451 of the front frame 2 2 by pushing the operating lever 455 {the example of FIG. 9) or by pulling the lock<br>
46<br><br>
plate 457 (the example of FIG. 11), and the vehicle body frame is separated.  The front frame 22, the handle post 7, the handle 8, the front fork 5, and the front wheel WF are integrally contained on the left side in the tray 58. On the other hand, the rear frame 23, the assist unit 1, and the rear wheel WR are integrally contained on the right side in the tray 58, after folding up the pedals 13. [0074]<br>
FIG. 30 is a perspective view of a rear portion of the automobile WGN, and FIG. 31 is a sectional view of a major part of the same.  As shown in FIG. 30, in the condition where the tray 58 is drawn out, most of the motor - assisted bicycle is located on the rear side of the automobile outside the range covered by the shelf plate 65, so that the user can easily load the motor - assisted bicycle onto and down from the automobile without being interfered by the shelf plate 65. [0075]<br>
In addition, a plug socket 66 for AC 100 volts is provided on an interior side wall of the automobile WGN. As shown in FIG. 31, power source is supplied from the plug socket 66 to the charger 6 0  mounted on   the back side of the shelf plate 65 through a cord 67, and a direct current of a predetermined voltage rectified by the<br>
47<br><br>
charger 60 is supplied to the battery 41 through a cord 68.  The cord 68 and the battery 41 are connected to each other through a connector 43 . [0076]<br>
By utilizing the AC plug socket 66 in this manner, for example, by effective use of the time until reaching the destination such as a resort, the battery 41 can be charged by a generator driven by the engine of the automobile WGN. [0077]<br>
While the motor-assisted bicycle to which the present invention is applied has been described, the present invention is not limited to the motor-assisted bicycle, and can generally and widely be applied to bicycles in which it is desired to fold the handle portion from the handle post. [0078] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
As is clear from the above description, according to the inventions as set forth in claims 1 to 9, the handle can be swirled with the head pipe as a center with such an offset amount as to be along a side surface of the vehicle body, and the handle and the handle post can be turned in a plane along the side surface of the<br>
48<br><br>
vehicle body.  Therefore, a steering device with a large height from a folding portion to the top end can be folded up without taking a large space in the vehicle body width direction.  As a result, the bicycle can be easily disassembled, and complicatedness relating to transportation of the bicycle to a resort or the like and use of the bicycle is alleviated.  Particularly, according to the inventions as set forth in claim 5 and claim 9, folding of the handle post can be easily started by turning the eccentric shaft, so that operability is good.<br>
