				<td>ARC FURNACE PRESSURE RING ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a pressure ring assembly suitable for use in an electrical arc<br>
furnace, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to a pressure ring assembly suitable<br>
for use on a lower section of an electrode column.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Electric arc furnaces are commonly used in the steel and ferro alloy production industry<br>
during pyrometallurgical smelting operations. An electric arc furnace includes one or<br>
more electrodes that extend into the furnace and that are arranged in use proximate a<br>
furnace load for supplying the energy required during smelting operations. Electric<br>
transformers are generally located outside the furnace and electric power is conducted<br>
from such transformers to the electrodes by means of contact shoes that are<br>
circumferentially arranged about and releasably engaged with the electrodes. "<br>
It will be appreciated that for optimal power conductivity, the contact shoes must at all<br>
relevant times be maintained in proper electrical contact with the electrodes. In order to<br>
maintain proper electrical contact between the contact shoes and the electrode during<br>
generally harsh operating conditions, a pressure ring is commonly arranged<br>
circumferentially about the contact shoes and dimensioned to maintain a number of<br>
contact shoes in electrical contact with the electrode.<br>
Various pressure ring arrangements are encountered in the industry, including<br>
continuous pressure rings (commonly referred to as solid rings), and segmented<br>
pressure rings, which comprise of a number of arcuate segments that are<br>
interconnected to form a circular ring. Segmented pressure rings are often preferred<br>
due to the maintenance difficulties associated with the replacement of components of<br>
the contact shoes when a solid ring is used.<br>
One of the difficulties encountered with segmented pressure rings concerns connecting<br>
mechanisms with which adjacent ring segments are connected to each other. A first<br>
difficulty is that available connecting mechanisms are often difficult to connect and<br>
disconnect, and once disconnected even more difficult to reconnect. This is particularly<br>
problematic in a case where a hinge-and-pin-type connecting mechanism is used. A<br>
further problem associated with most known connecting mechanisms is that adjacent<br>
segments of the pressure ring need to be perfectly aligned for such mechanisms to be<br>
used and these mechanisms are not configured to aid in aligning the segments upon<br>
installation thereof. Also, known connecting mechanisms, including hinge-and-pin-type<br>
and parallel-pin-type connecting mechanisms, are designed merely to prevent<br>
segments from being displaced away from each other in use, but contributes nothing to<br>
drawing adjacent segments closer to each other during installation.<br>
A further important requirement pertaining to the contact shoes is that they must<br>
preferably be located relatively low down on the electrodes. However, this implies that<br>
the contact shoes, and thus the pressure rings, are to be located in close proximity of<br>
the high temperature section of the arc furnace. The pressure rings are therefore<br>
exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Contrary to the electrodes, the pressure<br>
rings are not classified as consumables, and must therefore be able to withstand the<br>
harsh furnace operating conditions for extended periods of time.<br>
Given the conditions in which the pressure rings operate, the overriding design<br>
parameters dominating pressure ring life are generally effective heat dissipation through<br>
the pressure rings and adequate mechanical strength. Various solutions have been<br>
proposed to extend the life of the pressure rings by optimising and/or manipulating the<br>
above design criteria.<br>
A first solution, which is implemented in a so-called "split design", suggests providing a<br>
heat shield around an outer peripheral and bottom surface of the pressure ring which is<br>
most exposed to the severe operating conditions. The heat shield is manufactured of a<br>
material that has good heat-conductivity characteristics, such as copper. The heat<br>
shield can be of limited mechanical strength, as the pressure ring, and not the heat<br>
shield, will absorb the force exerted on the contact shoes. The heat shield will thus<br>
protect the pressure ring from being exposed to excessive furnace temperatures, and<br>
the heat-conductivity of the pressure ring becomes less critical. The solution is however<br>
complex, not always cost efficient and often not feasible due to size complexities.<br>
A second solution, which is generally implemented in a so-called "compound design",<br>
suggests a pressure ring manufactured from a material having good heat-conductivity<br>
characteristics, such as pure copper. However, pure copper lacks the mechanical<br>
strength to withstand the forces imparted on the pressure ring by the contact shoes, and<br>
is especially prone to creep. The occurrence of creep is furthermore proportional to the<br>
temperature of the pressure ring, which renders pure copper generally unsuitable for<br>
use. In order to overcome the shortcomings in mechanical strength, a pressure ring<br>
made from pure copper would have to be of substantial size to allow the maximum<br>
stresses in the pressure ring to be reduced to levels where the occurrence of creep will<br>
be below acceptable limits. However, this results in the pressure ring becoming heavy<br>
and bulky, and consequently expensive to manufacture and difficult to handle. Such a<br>
pressure ring is also not compatible with standard furnace set-ups, as there is generally<br>
insufficient space for the larger pressure ring.<br>
As a compromise one may consider using a material having better mechanical strength<br>
than that of pure copper, but which as a trade-off has lower heat conductivity<br>
characteristics than pure copper. A pressure ring made from such material would thus<br>
be able to handle the stresses caused by the contact shoes, whilst still being reasonably<br>
compatible with the harsh temperature conditions. Materials such as carbon steel,<br>
stainless steel and aluminium bronze are widely used in industry, but such materials all<br>
suffer from the common disadvantage of having sub-optimal heat conductivity<br>
characteristics, thus adversely affecting the life of the pressure rings.<br>
A further aspect of pressure ring assemblies that are often problematic is the interface<br>
between the pressure ring and the contact shoes. A contact shoe is pushed away from<br>
the pressure ring towards the electrode in order to engage the same. This is generally<br>
achieved either be using a hydraulic piston arrangement, or some other mechanical<br>
drive system.<br>
A number of hydraulic piston arrangements are known in the industry. In most<br>
arrangements the piston is located in a pressurisation cavity defined in a concave face<br>
of a pressure ring segment. A fluid is introduced under pressure into the pressurisation<br>
cavity by way of flow channels that are embedded in the pressure ring segment, and<br>
imparts an outwardly directed hydraulic force on the piston, which in turn relays a force<br>
to an adjacent contact shoe to force the contact shoe into engagement with the<br>
electrode. It will be appreciated that this arrangement will only work optimally if the<br>
pressurisation cavity between the pressure' ring segment and the piston is properly<br>
sealed, as it will otherwise not be possible to raise the pressure in the cavity to actuate<br>
the piston sufficiently. In addition, the sealing arrangement between the pressure ring<br>
segment and the piston should be able to accommodate relative displacement between<br>
the pressure ring and the piston.<br>
Various seals have previously been used in this application. Rubber diaphragms have<br>
for instance been used due to their inherent resilience, but have proven to be<br>
susceptible to premature failure due to incompatibility with the high temperature<br>
conditions.<br>
A further type of resilient seal that has been used with some success in pressure ring<br>
assemblies is metal bellows. The prior art provides for two types of metal bellows in<br>
pressure rings, namely formed bellows and plate or diaphragm bellows. Formed<br>
bellows is produced by shaping a uniform metal tube or sleeve into a continuously<br>
convoluted bellows, whilst diaphragm bellows is formed by a single thin plate that<br>
deforms under pressure.<br>
However, a number of problems have been encountered with the use of both formed<br>
and diaphragm bellows. Firstly, formed bellows takes up a relatively large space, thus<br>
resulting in the piston having to be of smaller diameter in order to fit inside the<br>
pressurisation cavity in the pressure ring segment. The smaller piston diameter<br>
necessitates higher hydraulic pressure in order to exert the same force on the contact<br>
shoes.<br>
A second problem associated with both formed and diaphragm bellows is that only a<br>
limited number of convolutions can be accommodated in the small space between the<br>
piston and the pressurisation cavity and this relatively small number of convolutions<br>
must satisfy the displacement requirements of the piston. This results in the<br>
convolutions being expanded beyond optimal design criteria, which in turn results in<br>
high stresses and metal fatigue in the bellows, and necessitates higher hydraulic<br>
pressure to obtain sufficient piston movement. Also, diaphragm bellows suffer from low<br>
displacement possibilities and high stresses, leading to metal fatigue and premature<br>
failure.<br>
As an alternative to hydraulic arrangements, mechanical drive systems have also been<br>
implemented to push the contact shoes towards the electrode. However, these systems<br>
suffer from the disadvantage of being complex and prone to failure, thus not providing a<br>
suitable alternative to hydraulic arrangements.<br>
Those engaged in the industry will appreciate that an electrical arc furnace operates<br>
under negative pressure, which means that there is a tendency for atmospheric air to be<br>
sucked into the furnace. This may result in unwanted combustion of CO, resulting from<br>
pyrometallurgical reaction processes in the furnace, in the vicinity of the electrode<br>
where it protrudes through a furnace roof, thus increasing temperatures in the vicinity of<br>
the pressure rings. This may cause the pressure rings, contact shoes and pistons to<br>
overheat and break.<br>
It will further be understood that the electrode and its components are pressurised by<br>
means of a fan, directed at blowing air down the electrode so as to create a gas seal<br>
above the furnace for preventing escape of furnace gasses and resultant formation of a<br>
gas chimney upwards along the electrode. In a case of improper sealing about the<br>
pressure ring assembly, the undesired escape of furnace gasses may degrade the gas<br>
seal, causing further damage to the electrode components.<br>
The prior art makes little provision for a seal between the pressure ring and the contact<br>
shoes and at best suggests stuffing heat resistant wool or soft refractory clay into the<br>
gap between the pressure ring and the contact shoes. This makeshift seal is usually of<br>
low integrity and is often blown out of position when a sudden pressure increase occurs<br>
in the furnace interior, such as in the case of explosions in the furnace.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is accordingly an object of this invention to provide a pressure ring assembly that will,<br>
.at least partially, alleviate the disadvantages associated with existing pressure ring<br>
assemblies, and/or will provide a novel and useful alternative to existing pressure ring<br>
assemblies.<br>

SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, a non-limiting embodiment of a pressure ring assembly in<br>
accordance with the invention is generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The<br>
pressure ring assembly 10 includes a pressure ring 20, comprising a plurality of<br>
interconnected pressure ring segments 22, a plurality of contact shoes 50 located<br>
adjacent an operatively inner face 36 of the pressure ring 20, as well as a plurality of<br>
piston arrangements 40 located between each contact shoe 50 and the pressure ring<br>
20. In use the pressure ring 20 and contact shoes 50 encircles an electrode (not<br>
shown) used in the electric arc furnace (not shown).<br>
The pressure ring 20 according to the particular embodiment is a circular ring when<br>
viewed in plan, and two adjacent pressure ring segments 22 of the pressure ring are<br>
shown in figures 1 and 2. Each pressure ring segment is arcuate when viewed in plan,<br>
and includes an outer face 35 facing away from the electrode and an inner face 36<br>
facing the electrode (not shown). Each pressure ring segment has a top end 24 and a<br>
bottom end 25, the bottom end in this embodiment terminating in a substantially Lshaped<br>
section. A circumferential recess 33 is provided towards the bottom end 25 of<br>
the pressure ring segment 22, and in this particular configuration the recess 33 is<br>
located in a face of the L-shaped section that faces the contact shoe 50. A seal 54 is<br>
located in the groove, and is described in more detail herein below. A hanger bracket 23<br>
extends from the top end 24, and is used to suspend the pressure ring segment 22, and<br>
thus the pressure ring 20, from a hanger bracket 51 connected to the contact shoe 50.<br>
Each pressure ring segment 22 furthermore has opposing, parallel side ends 26, being<br>
substantially perpendicular relative to the top and bottom ends, 24 and 25.<br>
Engagement formations 27 are located proximate the side ends 26, and extends at<br>
least partially between the top end 24 and the bottom end 25 of the pressure ring<br>
segment 22. In this particular embodiment the engagement formations 27 are in the<br>
form of recesses located in the inner face 36 of the pressure ring segment 22, but it will<br>
be appreciated that the engagement formations can be in the form of elongate<br>
protrusions rather than recesses, and that the engagement formations can be located in<br>
the outer face 35 instead of the inner face 36 of the pressure ring segment 22. The<br>
recesses 27 are tapered relative to the side ends 26, and more particularly are tapered<br>
away from the side ends 26 going down from the top end 24 to the bottom end 25. In<br>
the particular embodiment the recesses 27 are tapered along an entire length thereof,<br>
but it will be appreciated that only a part of each recess needs to be tapered, and that a<br>
remainder may for instance be parallel relative to the side ends 26.<br>
As is best seen in figures 1 and 5, the recesses 27 are furthermore undercut towards<br>
side ends 26 of the pressure ring segments 22 so as to define lips 28 that aid in<br>
securely connecting adjacent pressure ring segments 22.<br>
Adjacent pressure ring segments 22 are releasably connected by means of outwardly<br>
tapering or diverting connecting means 60. In this particular example the connecting<br>
means are in the form of elongate sliding brackets, shown in perspective in figure 9.<br>
Each sliding bracket 60 includes two elongate leg sections 61, which is connected to<br>
each other by means of an intermediate bridge section 62. The two elongate leg<br>
sections 61 are tapered relative to each other and relative to an elongate axis 64 of the<br>
sliding bracket 60, and more particularly the two leg sections 61 diverge so as to fit the<br>
complimentary tapered recesses 27 in adjacent pressure ring segments 22. The bridge<br>
section 62 shown in this embodiment is in the form of a substantially solid sheet-like<br>
section extending between the leg sections 61 along substantially the whole length of<br>
the leg sections 61, but the bridge section may also comprise a plurality of spaced apart<br>
cross-braces (not shown). It will be appreciated that the leg sections and the bridge<br>
section may be integrally formed, for instance from a sheet of material being bent into a<br>
suitable shape, or cast from cast steel. The sliding bracket 60 also includes an aperture<br>
63 for use during installation and removal of the sliding bracket 60. As can be seen<br>
from figure 5, the sliding bracket 60 is substantially C-shaped when seen in crosssectional<br>
plan view. Similarly the bracket can also be U-shaped or V-shaped.<br>
In use two pressure ring segments 22 are positioned adjacent one another so that the<br>
adjacent recesses 27 form two diverging channels or engagement formations. Proper<br>
alignment is facilitated by providing alignment apertures 29 and alignment balls 34 in<br>
the sides 26 of the pressure ring segments. A connecting device 60 is subsequently<br>
inserted from the top end 24 of the pressure ring segments 22 in order for the elongate<br>
leg sections 61 to enter the recesses 27 from above. As the connecting device 60 is<br>
forced downwardly, the leg sections 61 engage the recesses 27 and the lips 28, in so<br>
doing forcing the two pressure ring segments 22 towards one another due to the<br>
tapered configuration of the sliding bracket 60 and the recesses 27. It will be<br>
appreciated that the recesses 27, and thus the leg sections 61 of the sliding bracket 60,<br>
need not be diverging or tapered along the entire length thereof. Sections of the<br>
clamping device 61 and recesses 27 may be substantially parallel, as long as at least<br>
some sections, whether upper or lower sections, are tapered.<br>
A contact shoe 50 is located adjacent the inner face 36 of each pressure ring segment<br>
22. In a complete pressure ring assembly 10 the contact shoes 50 are thus located<br>
radially inwardly from the pressure ring, so that the pressure ring 20 surrounds the<br>
contact shoes 50. The contact shoes 50 are displaceable relative to the pressure ring<br>
segments 22, so as to be able to engage an electrode (not shown) being located inside<br>
the pressure ring 20 as well as the contact shoes 50. When an electrode is engaged, a<br>
reaction force is exerted on the contact shoes towards the pressure ring segments 22,<br>
which in turn absorbs such reaction force. It should be noted that the weight of the<br>
contact shoe 50 is carried via a contact shoe hanger bracket 51, and not by the<br>
pressure ring segment 22.<br>
A piston arrangement 40, as seen in figure 3, is provided in each pressure ring segment<br>
22 in order to facilitate movement of a contact shoe 50 relative to a pressure ring<br>
segment 22. The piston arrangement 40 includes a pressurisation cavity 42 formed by<br>
a piston push plate 41, a sleeve-like housing 43 and the inner face 36 of the pressure<br>
ring segment 22. The piston push plate 41 is moveably connected relative to the<br>
pressure ring segment 22 and sleeve-like housing 43 by means of a seal 44 in the form<br>
of a bellows, which also serves to seal the pressurisation cavity 42. The bellows 44 is<br>
shown in more detail in figure 7, and comprises a number of washer-like metal discs 46,<br>
arranged side by side with spacers 49 provided there between. Outer edges of the<br>
discs 46 are welded to the spacers 49, and inner edges 47 are welded to one another to<br>
form a concertina-like bellows. This type of bellows is often referred to as leaf bellows.<br>
In use the bellows 44 is displaceable in the direction indicated by arrow A. The metal<br>
discs are typically of a thickness between 0.1mm and 2mm.<br>
A first end of the bellows 44 is welded to the piston push plate 41, and a second end of<br>
the bellows 44 is welded to an inner face of the sleeve-like housing 43. This<br>
configuration result in the piston push plate 41 being moveable relative to the bellow<br>
housing 43, but whilst still being sealed relative to the bellow housing 43. The<br>
pressurisation cavity 42 therefore remains continuously sealed along the entire stroke of<br>
the piston push plate 41. Movement of the piston push plate 41 relative to the pressure<br>
ring segment 22 is limited by means of a stroke limiter 45, which can be of various<br>
configurations, but in the particular configurations is in the form of a bolt that can be set<br>
in a required position.<br>
The pressurisation cavity 42 is be pressurised so as to impart an outward force on the<br>
piston push plate 41. The resilience of the bellows 44 allows the piston push plate 41 to<br>
be displaced away from the pressure ring segment 22, so as to in use force the contact<br>
shoes 50 into abutment with the electrode (not shown). It will be appreciated that the<br>
piston arrangement 40 can be in the form of a cartridge-type piston assembly, in which<br>
case the pressurisation cavity 42 will be defined by the piston push plate 41, sleeve-like<br>
housing 43 and an end plate extending from the sleeve-like housing 43. Such an<br>
assembly will be separate from the pressure ring segment, and will merely locate inside<br>
a recess provided in the pressure ring segment.<br>
The pressurisation cavity 42 is pressurised by introducing high-pressure fluid (such as<br>
water) into the pressurisation cavity 42 via a first flow channel 31 embedded inside the<br>
pressure ring segment 22. In this particular embodiment each pressure ring segment<br>
22 includes two internal flow channels that are configured in parallel. The second flow<br>
channel 32 is solely used as a cooling channel, wherein heat is removed from the<br>
pressure ring segment 22 by a cooling fluid flowing inside the cooling channel. Whilst<br>
the first flow channel 31 also contributes towards cooling, it also conveys liquid to and<br>
from the piston cavity 42. An increase in the feed pressure to the first flow channel 31<br>
will thus result in an increase in pressure in the pressurisation cavity 42, and thus in<br>
resultant piston push plate 41 movement.<br>
In use heat will be removed from the pressure ring segment by the fluid in the first flow<br>
channel 31 even if the second flow channel 32 is inoperative, and vice versa. This is<br>
beneficial in that the pressure ring segment can remain in operation even after the use<br>
of either the first 31 or second 32 flow channel has been terminated due to, for example,<br>
failing of the bellows 44, as sufficient heat transfer will be provided via the remaining<br>
flow channel until the system can be shut off for maintenance. This is a major<br>
improvement to other systems where heat transfer and piston displacement is facilitated<br>
by a single, shared channel. It will be appreciated that the first 31 and the second 32<br>
flow channels may be located outside the pressure ring segment 22 when a cartridgetype<br>
piston assembly is used as described hereinbefore.<br>
A secondary seal 48 is furthermore provided between the piston push plate 41 and the<br>
sleeve-like housing 43. The secondary seal 48 is located in a circumferential sealing<br>
groove located in the periphery of the piston push plate, and is typically in the form of a<br>
metal ring. This seal 48 prevents dust and dirt from entering the piston arrangement 40,<br>
and more particularly gaps between adjacent discs 46 of the bellows 44.<br>
As mentioned above, a seal 54 is located in a recess 33 provided in the bottom end 25<br>
of the pressure ring segment 22. A lower section 53 of the contact shoe 50 defines an<br>
opposing sealing face, so as to seal an annular gap between the contact shoes 50 and<br>
the pressure ring 20. The sealing arrangement is shown in more detail in figure 6. The<br>
seal may comprise a plurality of seal segments sections positioned adjacent one<br>
another to form a substantially continuous circumferential seal. It will be appreciated<br>
that various combination can be utilised, such a providing the circumferential groove in<br>
the contact shoe as opposed to the pressure ring, or to provide circumferential recesses<br>
in both the pressure ring and the contact shoe. Various seals 54 can be utilised in this<br>
application. For instance a ceramic seal can be used in which case the seal can be<br>
biased towards a sealing position by providing a spring washer between the seal and<br>
the recess. In the alternative, a resilient seal may be used, in which case a spring<br>
washer or the like will not be required.<br>
The pressure ring 20 is exposed to elevated temperatures because of its location in<br>
close proximity of the furnaces interior. In addition substantial outwardly directed<br>
reaction forces are exerted on the pressure ring due to the clamping action of the<br>
contact shoes 50 on the electrode. It is therefore important to manufacture the pressure<br>
ring 20, and more particularly the individual pressure ring segments 22, from a material<br>
firstly having good heat conductivity characteristics to ensure proper heat removal, and<br>
secondly having good mechanical strength properties at elevated temperatures. It is of<br>
particular importance that the material has a reasonably low creep rate under hightemperature,<br>
high-stress conditions.<br>
The inventors surprisingly found that copper/chrome and copper/silver micro alloys<br>
proved to be particularly suitable for this application. Alloys comprising 0.15% percent<br>
(weight by weight) silver and 1.5% percent (weight by weight) chrome were tested, and<br>
improved performance was noted. For example, the improved performance of the<br>
copper and silver (denoted CuAg in the graph) is shown in figure 9, being a comparison<br>
between the creep per 1000 hours versus stress at elevated temperatures for different<br>
materials. It will be apparent form the graph that the copper/silver alloy can withstand<br>
higher stresses at the same creep rate experienced in traditionally used materials such<br>
as oxygen-free copper (CuOF) and high-conductivity copper (HC Cu). The addition of<br>
silver or chrome to copper somewhat reduces the heat conductivity of the material<br>
compared to pure copper, but the heat conductivity is still within acceptable margins,<br>
and more particularly is still up to 6.5 times that of Aluminium Bronze and carbon steel,<br>
and up to 20 times that of stainless steel, which were all previously used in this<br>
application.<br>
It has also been found that correct material selection when designing the bellow housing<br>
43 and piston push plate 41 contributes substantially towards extending the life and<br>
increasing the reliability of the pressure ring assembly. In this regard it was found that<br>
using a material with thermal conductivity in excess of 100 Watt per meter Kelvin, such<br>
as copper, substantially improved the cooling ability of the bellow housing and piston<br>
push rate, thus resulting in a longer life expectancy.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above is only one embodiment of the invention, and that<br>
there may be many variations in detail without departing from the spirit and the scope of<br>
the invention as set out in the claims.<br>
