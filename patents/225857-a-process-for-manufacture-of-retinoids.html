Manufacture of Retinoids<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of vitamin A aldehyde (retinal), a valuable intermediate in the synthesis of further vitamin A compounds (retinoids). The retinoids, particularly vitamin A alcohol (retinol), are known to be valuable substances which promote the well-being of humans, inter alia in respect of vision, the immune system and growth, and for this reason are often used as components of multivitamin preparations and as additives for certain food- and feedstuffs. The present invention further concerns novel starting materials in the aforementioned process and further process steps leading to (all-E)-vitamin A acetate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
pr, from the compound of the formula IVe, the compound of the formula<br><br>
and, where a compound of the formula Va or Vb has been produced, hydrogenating this to produce retinal of the formula I or the compound of the formula I' respectively, and in each case where a compound of the formula I' or I" has been produced, isomerizing this under basic or acidic conditions or in the presence of a metal catalyst to the desired retinal of the formula I.<br>
In the above definition the term "C1-6allcyl" embraces (from C3) straight-chain or branched alkyl groups with up to six carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert. butyl, neopentyl and n-hexyl. This applies equally to the C1-6-alkyl part of such groups as "C1-6-alkoxy" and "C1-6-alkylthio", and to all the bracketed C1-6-alkyl and C1-6-alkoxy groups. Where more than one C1-6-aIkyl group is present in a group signified by RYR or R , e.g. in such groups as "tri(C1-6-alkyl)siIyloxy", di(C1-6-alkyl)aminon, "di(C1-6-alkyl)phosphonyl" or ntn(C1-6-alkyl)silyl", such C1-6-alkyl groups may be the same or different. "Aryl" as such or as the aryl (or "ar") part of "aryloxy", "arylthio", "aroyloxy", "arylsulphonyloxy", "arylsulphonyl", "N-aryl-(C1-6-alkyl)aminon, diarylamino", "aroyl" or "diarylphosphonyl" means phenyl, 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl, or a conventionally substituted such group, e.g. p-tolyl.<br>
The above formulae I, I1,1", Ila, lib, lie, lid, He, III, IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd, IVe, Va and Vb embrace in each case isomeric forms, e.g. optically active or inactive and E/Z-isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, unless expressly stated to the contrary. With respect to the E/Z isomerism, although the (all-E) isomeric form of the intermediate of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd, IVe, Va, Vb, I1 or I" and of the product, retinal, of the formula I, is in each case preferred, each is normally present or produced, as appropriate, as a mixture of E- and Z-isomers.<br>
In the first step of the process in accordance with the invention, i.e. the reaction of the derivative of the formula Ila, lib, lie, lid or lie [hereinafter referred to for brevity as the "5-substituted pentadiene", "pentadiene", "pentene", "penta-l-en-4-yne" or "penta-1-en-4-yne" derivative, respectively [or collectively as "5-substituted pent(adi)en(yn)e"]with<br><br>
he 1,3-butadiene derivative under acidic conditions, an exclusive attack of the former Lerivative at the y-position of the 1,3-butadiene derivative takes place.<br>
This first process step is conveniently carried out by reacting the 5-substituted ?ent(adi)en(yn)e derivative of the formula Ha, lib, He, lid or lie with the 1,3-butadiene lerivative of the formula III in an organic solvent at temperatures in the range of about -70°C to about +60°C, preferably in the temperature range of about -30°C to room :emperature, and in the presence of a Lewis or Bronsted acid as the catalyst. Suitable organic solvents are, in general, polar or non-polar aprotic solvents. Such solvents are, for example, lower halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride and chloro¬form; lower aliphatic and cyclic ethers, e.g. diethyl ether, tert. butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; lower aliphatic nitriles, e.g. acetonitrile; lower aliphatic esters, e.g. ethyl acetate; lower aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. pentane and hexane; as well as aromatic hydro¬carbons, e.g. toluene. The preferred solvent is acetonitrile, optionally in combination with further aforementioned solvents. Where a mixture of acetonitrile with a further solvent is used, the ratio by volume of acetonitrile to such other solvent is preferably about 1 : 1 to about 1 : 0.5. Examples of Lewis acids which can be used are zinc chloride, zinc chloride dietherate, zinc bromide, zinc di(trifluoromethanesulphonate), titanium tetrachloride, tin tetrachloride, boron trifluoride etherate, iron(III) chloride, trimethylsilyl triflate as well as lithium perchlorate, and examples of Bronsted acids which can be used are p-toluene-sulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, sulphuric acid as well as trifluoroacetic acid. In general, the Lewis acids, especially the aforementioned zinc salts, boron trifluoride etherate and iron(III) chloride, are preferred. The acid catalysts are in general used in catalytic (below stoichiomeric) amounts, conveniently in an amount which is about 0.5 to about 30 mol percent based on the amount of 5-substituted pent(adi)en(yn)e derivative used, the mol percent range preferably being from about 1% to about 15%. Where a 5-substituted pent(adi)en(yn)e derivative of the formula Ha, lib, lie, lid or He is used in which R 'signifies a basic group, in particular di(Ci-6-alkyl)amino, N-aryl-(C1-6-alkyl)amino or diarylamino, a greater relative amount of acid catalyst will clearly be required, generally at least one mol equivalent. Furthermore, there are conveniently used about 1.1 to about 2.5 equivalents, preferably about 1.1 to about 1.8 equivalents, of 1,3-butadiene derivative per equivalent of 5-substituted pent(adi)ene derivative. Moreover, the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure. In general the pressure is not critical.<br>
In preparing for the isolation of the product of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe, as appropriate, an acid, preferably slightly dilute aqueous acetic acid, for example featuring a ratio by volume acetic acid : water of about 9:1, may be added to the reaction mixture and the mixture is subsequently stirred for a period, for example about 30 minutes<br><br>
to about 2 hours, conveniently in the temperature range of about -10°C to about 30°C. This incorporated acidification/hydrolysis step ensures that the desired intermediate of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe is finally produced from the reaction of the pent(adi)en(yn)e derivative of the formula IIa, IIb,IIe, IId orIIe with the 1,3-butadiene derivative of the formula III. The acidification/hydrolysis step is generally unnecessary, however, when the latter derivative features R4 as tri(C1-6-alkyI)silyl. In any event the acidification/hydrolysis step is useful to remove excess butadiene derivative from the mixture after reaction and before the isolation of the product of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe.<br>
The product of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe can then be isolated from the reaction mixture and, if desired, purified in a manner known per se. Typically, the mixture is combined with water and the whole is extracted with a water-immiscible organic solvent, such as, for example, a lower alkane, dialkyl ether or aliphatic ester, e.g. hexane, tert. butyl methyl ether or, respectively, ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is washed with water and/or sodium bicarbonate solution and/or saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried and concentrated. The so-isolated and at least to some extent washed crude product can then, if desired, be purified further, for example by column chromatography, e.g. using silica as the stationary phase and an eluting agent such as hexane, ethyl acetate, toluene or a mixture of one or more of these.<br>
With respect to the further (second) process step, i.e. the elimination of the compound R"H from the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe, this can be effected with a base or an acid. Eliminations of the alkanol from p-alkoxyaldehydes or 5-alkoxy-a,p-unsaturated aldehydes with the formation of the corresponding a,(3-unsaturated aldehydes are known in the chemical literature and can be carried out under a variety of conditions, and such methodology can be applied to the present case. For example, in the field of known base-induced eliminations l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene is very often used as the base in an amount of about 1 to 2 equivalents per equivalent of aldehyde used. Such conditions are used in the known production of carotenoids [see, inter alia, Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 50, 1161 et seq. (1977), ibid. 51, 2077 et seq. (1978), Chem. Lett. 1975, 1201 et seq. and German Offenlegungsschrift 2,701,489] and of vitamin A [see, inter alia, Chem. Lett. 1975,1201 et seq. and J. Gen. Chem. USSR, 32, 63 et seq. (1962)]. Further methodology, using a sodium alkanolate as the base, is described in, for example, the European Patent Publications (EP) 814,078, 816,334 and 978,508. As examples of acid-induced alkanol cleavages reference is again made to Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 50, 1161 et seq. (1977) and to J. Gen. Chem. USSR 30, 3875 et seq. (1960), in which p-toluene-sulphonic acid or 85% phosphoric acid is used as the acid catalyst. The buffer system sodium acetate/acetic acid [Helv. Chem. Acta 39, 249 et seq. and 463 et seq. (1956)<br><br>
and US Patent Specifications (USP) 2,827,481 and 2,827,482j has been used for such a cleavage, especially in the production of carotenoids. In the case of corresponding alkoxy ketones (P-alkoxy-ketones or 5-alkoxy-a,(3-unsaturated ketones), too, the cleavage of the alkanol in general succeeds very well: see in this respect Synthesis 1986, 1004 et seq. or J. Org. Chem. 49, 3604 et seq. (1984). Taking into consideration this and other pertinent literature a person skilled in the art will have no difficulties in finding reaction conditions for the successful performance of the second step of the process in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the elimination of the compound R2H can also be carried out with several equivalent amounts of a base for each equivalent of the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe. Thus, the process step in this case is conveniently carried out by submitting the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe, dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, to treatment with a base with elimination of the compound R"H. Suitable organic solvents are, in general, protic or aprotic solvents or mixtures thereof, such as, for example, alcohols, e.g. ethanol and isopropanol, and alcohol mixtures; lower halogenated, preferably chlorinated, aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride and chloroform; and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene. The base can be inorganic or organic, and these are suitably, in general, strong bases, especially those alkali metal alcoholates which are stronger bases, e.g. sodium ethylate, and nitrogen-containing bases, such as 1,8-diaza-bicyclo[5.4.0] undec-7-ene, trialkylamines, e.g. triethylamine, and pyridine. As indicated above, there is conveniently used at least one equivalent of base per equivalent of the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe, preferably about 1 to about 2 equivalents of base.<br>
When an alkali metal alcoholate is used as the base, either a solution of the sodium alkoxide in the alkanol is prepared in advance or this solution is prepared freshly from metallic sodium and the alkanol. The bringing together of the alkanolic solution of the sodium alkoxide with the solution or suspension of the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe in the (same) alkanol, preferably likewise prepared in advance, can be effected in either sequence. The reaction mixture is then stirred, suitably in the temperature range of about -20°C to about 120°C, preferably at temperatures of about 0°C to about 70°C. Depending on the boiling point of the solvent the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure or with a slight excess pressure (in order to achieve the desired temperature). In general, however, the pressure is not critical. Under these conditions the elimination reaction is normally completed within a few hours, especially after about 30 minutes to about 4 hours.<br>
In the case of an acid-induced elimination of the compound R2H, suitable acids are, in general, strong mineral acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br><br>
^cid, hydriodic acid, sulphuric acid and perchloric acid, and sulphonic acids, such as, for example, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid. The mineral acids can be aqueous and, depending on the acid, can have a concentration of about 10 to about 50%. Hydrochloric acid (especially about 10 to 37%), hydrobromic acid (especially about 25 to 63%) or hydriodic acid (e.g. 47%) is the most suitable. In this case only a catalytic amount, i.e. up to a maximum of 1 equivalent per equivalent of the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 equivalent, is required. Further, the acid-induced elimination is effected in a solvent in which the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe has a good solubility and is dissolved therein(a so-called "homogeneous cleavage") or in a solvent in which this is not the case, i.e. in which the compound of the formula IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd or IVe is instead in suspension ("heterogeneous cleavage"). In both cases, however, the acid catalyst need not be completely dissolved. Suitable solvents for the homogenous cleavage are especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane, and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and toluene. Suitable solvents (dispersion media) for the heterogeneous cleavage are lower aliphatic nitriles, ketones and carboxylic acids, e.g. acetonitrile, acetone and, respectively, acetic acid, preferably acetonitrile and acetone. In both cases the elimination is conveniently effected in the temperature range of about -20°C to about+50°C, preferably in the range of about 0°C to room temperature. The reaction time depends in each case on the reaction temperature and can amount to several hours, the elimination reaction normally being completed at the latest after about 5 hours.<br>
Irrespective of the chosen procedure for the R H elimination step, the product of the formula I, I1,1", Va or Vb, as appropriate, can be isolated from the reaction mixture in a manner known per se, normally by cooling the reaction mixture, conveniently to room temperature or even to about 0°C, optional addition of water and extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent. As such a solvent there is suitably used a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. pentane or hexane; an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g. toluene; or a lower aliphatic ester, e.g. ethyl acetate. After its isolation the product can be purified further, if necessary or desired, by column chromatography or another conventional method for purifying retinal or an isomer or derivative thereof.<br>
In the case where the one starting material of the process of the present invention is the 5-substituted penta-l-en-4-yne derivative of the formula lid or He, the product at this stage of the process, i.e. after the elimination of the moiety R H from the compound of the formula IVd or IVe, as appropriate, is the compound of the formula Va or Vb, respectively. The next stage is the hydrogenation to produce retinal or the compound of the formula I' respectively. Said hydrogenation can be effected under catalytic<br><br>
hydrogenation conditions known per se, e.g. those conditions used in the analogous procedures described in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Vol. IV/lc ("Reduktion", Teil 1), 105 et seq., Thieme Stuttgart 1980, and UK Patent Specification 722,911. The catalyst is conveniently a "poisoned" one of the Lindlar type, preferably 5% palladium on calcium carbonate poisoned with 3.5% lead, and the temperature and pressure are suitably in the range from about 5°C to about 50°C and about 1 to about 5 bar (about 0.1 to about 0.5 MPa), respectively. As the solvent there is suitably employed an organic solvent of relatively low polarity, e.g. an alkanol or an aliphatic ester, preferably ethyl acetate. Moreover, the (poisoned) catalyst can be advantageously modified by addition of a nitrogen-containing compound, such as quinoline.<br>
Following the R2H elimination step, or in the aforementioned case the additional hydrogenation step, the pertinent isolated and optionally purified product, being retinal or the product of the formula I' or I", as appropriate, is normally present as an isomeric mixture, in particular as a mixture of four isomers in respect of the 9- and 13- double bonds, said isomeric mixture being designated conventionally as the (9 E/Z, 13 E/Z) isomer.<br>
In the case where a compound of the formula V (starting from the 5-substituted 1,4-pentadiene or penta-l-en-4-yne derivative of the formula IIb or IIe, via the compound of the formula IVb or the compounds of the formulae IVe and Vb, respectively) is produced, or alternatively where a compound of the formula I" (starting from the 5-substituted 1-pentene derivative of the formula IIe, via the compound of the formula IVc) is produced, the respective product is then isomerized to the desired retinal of the formula I. Conditions for the pertinent isomerization with a base, an acid or a metal catalyst are known per se and are described for example in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 2090 et seq. (1986) and Chem. Ber. IIS, 348 et seq. (1985) using l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and alumina in ether, respectively, as the base; in EP 647,624 and J. Chem. Res. Synop. 296 et seq. (1987) in respect of acidic conditions; and in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1593 et seq. (1984) and Tetr. Lett. 1979, 1499 et seq. for the isomerization in the presence of the nonacarbonyl di-iron complex [Fe2(CO)9j in benzene] and the tri(triphenylphosphinyl)-rhodium chloride complex [Rh(PPh3)C1], respectively, as the metal catalyst.<br>
If desired the so-produced retinal, predominantly in the (9 E/Z, 13 E/Z)-isomeric form, can then be isomerized to the generally desired isomeric form of retinal, (all-E)-retinal. The isomerization can be effected under conventional isomerizing conditions, and a particularly preferred method involves the acid-catalysed formation of an adduct of (principally) (all-E)-retinal with hydroquinone from the retinal produced as defined and described above, and initially in the essentially (9 E/Z, 13 E/Z)-isomeric form, and the hydroquinone in an organic solvent in which the adduct itself is sparingly soluble, thereby<br><br>
affording the desired (all-E)-retinal - hydroquinone adduct in crystalline form. This adduct formation represents a further aspect of the present invention. As the acid catalyst there is suitably used hydrochloric acid (especially about 37%), hydrobromic acid (48%) or hydriodic acid (47%), p-toluenesulphonic acid or elemental iodine. The molar ratio of retinal starting material: hydroquinone is suitably about 1: 0.5, and the two components are conventionally brought together in an organic solvent in which the adduct itself is sparingly soluble, such as a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. pentane or hexane; or a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether. The preferred solvent is diethyl ether or a mixture of said ether and hexane. On leaving the two adduct components in such a solvent with a trace amount of the acid catalyst at ambient temperature the crystallization of the (all-E)-retinal - hydroquinone adduct generally occurs after a relatively short time, e.g. about one hour. The crystalline adduct can then be readily removed from the liquid medium by filtration and if desired washed, e.g. with a solvent usable for the formation and as mentioned above, and dried, preferably at room temperature under reduced pressure. Such conventional methodology for the formation and isolation of the (all-E)-retinal - hydroquinone is described for example in USP 3,013,081 and French Patent Publications 1,288,975 and 1,291,622.<br>
As an alternative to the prior isolation and optional purification of the retinal formed in the above defined/described two- or three-step process (not the three- or four-step process starting from the 5-(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohex-l-enyl)-penta-l-en-4-yne derivative of the formula lid or Ile'and involving the additional hydrogenation step) of the present invention in those cases where the R2H-elimination (second process step) is acid-induced and the above-described acid-catalysed retinal - hydroquinone adduct formation is intended, said second process step and the retinal - hydroquinone adduct formation step can be combined, thus avoiding the intermediate isolation and optional purification of the retinal prior to be adduct formation. In this alternative the solvent used for the acid-induced R"H elimination reaction, if not one in which the adduct would readily dissolve, such as a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, must be replaced, on completion of the elimination reaction, by one in which the adduct is insoluble or sparingly soluble. Such a replacement solvent is suitably a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. pentane or hexane, or a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, i.e. a solvent indicated above as being suitable for the "separate" adduct formation. The solvent replacement is suitably effected by evaporating off the "unsuitable" one under reduced pressure and adding the suitable one. Thereafter the hydroquinone is added and the procedure for crystallization and isolation of the resulting crystalline (all-E)-retinal - hydroquinone adduct effected as described above for the "separate" adduct formation.<br><br>
The so-obtained (all-E)-retinal - hydroquinone adduct can be converted to the further useful end product vitamin A alcohol (retinol) in the predominantly (all-E)-isomeric form by methods known per se, for example by direct catalytic reduction with hydrogen using a ruthenium catalyst, as described in J. Molec. Catalysis 79,117-131(1993), ibid. 66, L 27-L 31 (1991) and USP 4,906,795. This reduction can also be effected with sodium borohydride, as described in Chem. Lett. 1975,1201 et seq., which also indicates how retinol can be converted to vitamin A acetate by acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine.<br>

Those 5-substituted pent(adi)ene derivatives of the formulae IIa, IIb and IIe wherein R2 signifies chlorine or bromine can also be produced by "indirect" addition of HC1 or HBr, respectively, to the triple bond of the pertinent starting acetylenic compounds of the formulae Via, Vlb, Vic, Via', Vlb' and Vic' by initial addition of an organic boron compound [see, for example, J.

An alternative method for producing those 5-substituted pent(adi)ene derivatives of the formulae IIa, IIb and IIe wherein R signifies hydroxy! and R signifies Q-6-alkoxy is also based upon the principles described in such literature as Organometallics in Synthesis, A Manual, Ed.

y is reacted with the appropriate cis-l-lithio-2-alkoxyethylene (cis LiCH=CHOC1-6-alkyl) in an ethereal solvent at temperature of about -100°C to about 0°C. As the ethereal solvent there is especially employed a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether or dimethoxyethane, or a cyclic ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is preferably effected at temperature of about -70°C to about -40°C. Furthermore, the starting cis-l-lithio-2-alkoxyethylene is conveniently prepared in situ from the corresponding cis-l-bromo-2-alko\yethyIene (cis BrCH=CHOC1-6-alkyl) and n-butyllithium or sec. butyllithium (about equimolar amounts of the two reactants) or tert. butyllithium (in about double the molar amount relative to the amount of ethylene derivative employed) using the same solvent and reaction temperature as given above for the ensuing reaction with the so-produced l-lithio-2-alkoxyethylene. The ultimately produced 5-substituted pent(adi)ene derivative is conveniently isolated from the mixture after completed reaction by addition of water thereto and extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent, particularly an aprotic such solvent, such as a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. hexane; an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g. toluene; a lower halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride or chloroform; a lower aliphatic or cyclic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxan; or a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g. chlorobenzene. After removal of the extracting solvent, suitably at somewhat elevated temperature and reduced pressure, the appropriate desired 5-substituted l-alkoxy-3-methyl-3-hydroxy-pent(adi)ene of the formula IIa,IIb or IIc is generally obtainable in good purity and in practically quantitative yield. It does not normally have to be purified further before use in the process of the present invention involving reaction with the 1,3-butadiene derivative of the formula III.<br>

In the case of the precursor of the formula IX wherein R2 signifies (C1-6-alkyl)sulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy the compounds are novel, and no analogous methods for their production are known. However, they can be produced by reaction of 3-keto-butyraldehyde with the respective alkane- or arylsulphonyl chloride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofiiran and in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine. J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1991, 885-890, and J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1992, 2855-2861, respectively, provide pertinent information as to the methodology.<br>
The alternative novel starting materials for the process of the present invention, i.e. the 5-substituted penta-l-en-4-yne derivatives of the formulae IId and IIe, can be produced from the known l-ethynyl-2,6,6-trimethyI-cyclohex-l-ene or -2-ene, respectively, of the formula<br><br>
[(see USP 2,775,626 and Tetrahedron 55, 15071-15098 (1999), and Swiss Patent Specification 651,287, respectively, for the production of each l-ethynyl-2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohexene itself] by condensation reaction under deprotonating strongly basic and anhydrous conditions with a ketone of the formula IX, given above, in an inert organic solvent. As the strong base there is suitably used a base which is customary for the deprotonation of acetylenes, especially a lithium-, sodium- or magnesium-containing base. Examples of such bases are lithium-organic compounds such as methyllithium, butyllithium or phenyllithium, Grignard reagents such as alkylmagnesium halides and dialkylmagnesium, amides such as lithium amide and sodium amide, and hydrides such as lithium hydride and sodium hydride, the preferred base being an alkyllithium or an alkylmagnesium chloride. As the solvent there is suitably used an aliphatic or cyclic ether, e.g. diethyl ether or, respectively, tetrahydrofiiran or dioxan; or an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g. hexane or a petroleum ether or, respectively, benzene, toluene or an xylene. The preferred solvent for the reaction is tetrahydrofiiran. The ketone of formula<br><br>
t<br>
IX is preferably used in an equivalent amount or slight excess, e.g. 1.1 to 1.3 equivalents per equivalent of the l-ethynyl-2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohexene of the formula Xlla or Xllb. However, a larger excess is not necessarily detrimental to the outcome of the condensation reaction. Furthermore, a slight excess of base relative to the amount of the compound of the formula Xlla or Xllb, for example about 1.1 to 1.3 equivalents, is suitably used. Moreover, it is possible to effect the condensation reaction in the additional presence of an inorganic lithium or cerium salt, which is known to slightly increase the yield of the reaction. Examples of such salts are lithium halides, cerium halides and lithium tetrafluoroborate, cerium trichloride and lithium bromide being the preferred salts. The amount of lithium or cerium salt is not critical and can amount to, for example, about 0.5 to about 2.0 equivalents per equivalent of the amount of the compound of the formula Xlla or Xllb. Regardless of the particular above-indicated conditions employed the condensation is suitably effected at temperatures from about -80°C to about 10°C, preferably from about -70°C to about -50°C. The condensation reaction affords those 5-substituted penta-l-en-4-yne derivatives of the formulae IId and IIe wherein Rl signifies hydroxyl. The remaining 5-substituted penta-l-en-4-yne derivatives of the formulae lid and IIe, i.e. those wherein R signifies a group OR , can be produced from the former derivatives by analogous methods for producing the precursors of the formulae Via', Vlb1 and Vic' from the respective precursors of the formulae Via, Vlb and Vic, as indicated hereinabove by mention of pertinent references for the hydroxyl -&gt; OR3 group transformation.<br>
This condensation reaction affords, as indicated above, the starting 5-substituted penta-l-en-4-yne derivative of the formula IId orIIe for direct use in the process of the present invention, i.e. for reacting with the 1,3-butadiene derivative of the formula III. However, instead of such direct use, the derivative can be converted to the other employable starting material, viz. the 5-substituted 1,4-pentadiene derivative of the formula IIa or IIb, respectively, by selective reduction with a complex metal hydride, preferably a hydrido-aluminate, most preferably sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aIuminium hydride, under conditions described in the literature, e.g. analogous to the procedures described in Helv. Chim. Acta 73, 868-873 (1990) and USP 4,952,716 and 5,227,507. The reduction is conveniently carried out in an inert organic solvent, examples of such being those solvents given above in connection with the reaction of the l-ethynyl-2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohexene of the formula Xlla or Xllb with the ketone of the formula IX, especially the solvents referred to there as being preferred. The temperature and pressure by which the selective reduction is carried out are not critical. As the reduction proceeds rapidly, the reduction is preferably carried out at temperatures from about -50 °C to about 30 °C, more preferably at temperatures from about -10 °C to about 0°C, and at atmospheric pressure. The reducing agent can be used in an about equivalent amount, or<br><br>
preferably in excess amount, relative to the amount of starting 5-substitutedpenta-l-en-4-yne derivative of the formula IId or IIe. An amount which is at least about 1.1 equivalents, for example 1.2 to 1.4 equivalents, per equivalent of said derivative is preferred. However, a larger excess is not necessarily detrimental to the outcome of the selective reduction.<br>
The hydrolysis of the aluminium-complex, formed as the intermediate in the above-described selective reduction, to the desired 5-substituted 1,4-pentadiene derivative of the formula IIa or IIb can be effected in a manner known per se, for example, by treatment with water in the presence of an organic or inorganic acid such as p-toluenesulphonic acid, or more preferably in the presence of an alkali, such as in sodium hydroxide solution. The temperature and pressure are not critical. However, in general, the hydrolysis is carried out at atmospheric pressure and room temperature or a lower temperature, preferably at temperatures from about 0 °C to room temperature.<br>
The 1,3-butadiene derivatives of the formula III used as starting materials in the first step of the process of the present invention are either known compounds or can be produced analogously to the known compounds, for example according to the methods described in Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 130 (2), 200-205 (1993), Tetr. Lett. 22 (29), 2833-2836 (1989) and ibid. 26 (47), 8591-8594 (1995).<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples:<br><br>

Preparation of (1Z, 4E)-l-ethoxy-3-methyl-3-hvdroxy"5-(2,6,6-trimethvI-cvclohex-l-enyl)-l,4-pentadiene<br>
To 750 ml of tetrahydrofuran in a 750 ml reaction flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and argon gasification means were added under the argon atmosphere 17.6 ml (approx. 25 g, 0.16 mol) of cis-l-bromo-2-ethoxyethylene, and the mixture was then cooled to -70°C. 210 ml (0.32 mol) of tert. butyllithium (1.5 molar solution in hexane) were then slowly added to the stirred mixture under maintenance of a temperature of ~70°C to -60°C, the addition being completed within about 30 minutes. After stirring the mixture for a further 30 minutes at -70°C a solution of 20.2 g (0.103 mol) of fi-ionone (approx. 98% pure) in 60 ml of tetrahydrofuran was slowly added, maintaining the temperature of the mixture at -70°C to -60°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at -70°C for 3 hours, after which the reaction was established by HPLC to have been completed.<br>
The cooling means was removed and 200 ml of ice/water were added to the flask contents within about 10 minutes. After the mixture had reached a temperature of 0°C it was poured into 250 ml of hexane, and the whole was washed successively with three 200 ml quantities of water and two 200 ml quantities of saturated sodium chloride solution. Then the combined aqueous phases were extracted with 250 ml of hexane. The combined i    hexane phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and after removal of the drying agent by filtration concentrated at 35°C under a reduced pressure of 100-200 mbar (10-20 kPa), followed by a concentration at room temperature under high vacuum to remove the final traces of solvent. There resulted 30.25 g (quantitative yield) of (1Z, 4E)-l-ethoxy-3-methyl-3-hydroxy-5-(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohex-l-enyl)-l,4-pentadiene as a pale yellow oil.<br>

After the mixture had been stirred for 18 hours at ambient temperature, the reaction was quenched with 1.5 ml of 25%-ammonia and stirred for a further 30 minutes. The solution was then diluted with 50 ml of hexane and extracted with three 25 ml quantities of water and two 25 ml quantities of brine. The aqueous phases were re-extracted with 50 ml of hexane. The combined organic phases were concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 1.498 g (98% yield) of 2-(5-ethoxy-3-methoxy-3-methyl-(lE, 4Z)-penta-l,4-dienyl)-1,3,3-trimethyl-cyclohexene as a yellowish oil.
