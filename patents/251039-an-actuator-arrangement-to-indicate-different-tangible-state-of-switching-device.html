3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and.the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an actuator arrangement denoting different tangible state of switching device comprising a handle for actuating the switching device. More particularly, the invention relates to an integral arrangement of components within the actuator (herein indicated as handle coupler unit) adapted to denote different tangible states -of switching device "ON", "OFF" and/or "TRIP" by means of sensing module means operatively connected with indicator means comprising one or more colors indications in consonance with physical position of the handles indicating each state. The handle coupler unit finds its application in circuit breakers, switch fuse disconnector and the like.<br>
Background And Prior Art<br>
Switching devices and their combinations with associated operative control, measuring, protection and regulating equipments are conventionally known as Switchgear. in particular , Switchgears usually make or break the current in one or more electric circuits by various methods including use of mechanical switching means which include separable contacts. Such mechanical switches can be operable by toggle of knob attached with these switching device or by an arrangement of mechanism and extension shaft wherein these are operated by rotary motion of the handle coupler unit.<br>
Under these conditions, a rotable operating shaft with pin, and mechanism suitably adapted, actuates such switching devices, which is housed inside the enclosure commonly called as panel. It is important to note that keeping in view the safety requirements of such devices, it is extremely important<br>
                            2                                                          10 NOV 2005<br><br>
for such a handle coupler unit mounted outside the enclosure where in the device is mounted inside the enclosure to denote the right state,  as any wrong indication could result in extreme casualties.<br>
As per the present sate of art, the state of the switching device mounted inside an enclosure is indicated by a pointer on the handle coupler unit mounted outside the enclosure by the alignment of the pointer to the fixed base suitably marked as "ON", "OFF" and "TRIP"Yet  another mode  of  representation  of  the  state  of	theswitching unit is by different indicating lamps mounted on thepanel door and are individually powered corresponding to the state of the device.<br>
US6744363 discloses circuitry arrangement for switch-gear cabinet monitoring arrangement with a control device for monitoring switch-gear cabinet functions including door position and for generation of monitoring signals for signaling to and /or controlling components relating to the switch-gear cabinet functions. The monitoring state is assigned its own indicator element, the indicator element displays at least two of the different monitoring states.<br>
US6400547 further discloses monitoring state parameters and device of general type ensuring a reliable indication of switching state. This is obtained by recording and evaluating sensor signals of sensors an external electrical field and external magnetic field. The step of monitoring the state parameters in the switching device includes monitoring the switch position, a tripping cause and / or device fault.                                              <br>
  10 NOV 2005<br><br>
The devices used in practice till date are different, mostly electromechanical. Knobs with single colour glows denoting the "ON" state are already existing but the combination of emitting signal in all three state of switching device is unique as described under present invention.<br>
In the present invention the indicating means is governed by the circuit sensing the power hence glowing accordingly. This is achieved by physically sensing the position and connecting the same to an electrical supply for glowing the light emitting electronic device having electrodes or terminals in three different states harmonizing the glow with the physical movement of the handle.<br>

Another object of the present invention is to provide variant glowing colour indication on the handle of the switching device indicating each state of the switching device with particular colour.<br>
Yet another object of the current invention is to give clear indication of the state of switching mechanism particularly<br><br>
"on" "off" and "trip" by directly and electrically sensing, transmitting and displaying the state of switching device.<br>
The other object of the said invention, the handle serves the dual role of a actuator knob and an indicator thus saving on component and complex wiring arrangement, adding an elementary safety since an operator and machine interact through a single media i.e. handle.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
In figure 1 an isometric block representation of contact sensing module of the present invention in combination with the switching device is illustrated. The switching device (1) and the handle coupler unit (2) is operatively interconnected with each other by means of the extension mechanism (3) . The contact sensing module (4) is block represented and this is fitted in the cavities of the switching device (1).<br>
In figure 2 an isometric view of the handle coupler unit of the present invention. The transparent handle (5} is screw fitted on the base (6) of the handle coupler unit (2). The coupler unit (2) is provided with cavity (7) wherein the printed circuit boards (8) (also shown in figure 3) are accommodated. The contact sensing module (4) comprises light emitting diodes (9D1, 9D2, 9D3) (shown in figure 3) located vertically in the module (4) and encapsulated by the handle (5). The contact sensing module (4) comprises of micro switches in the housing (10) .<br>
1 0 NOV 2005<br><br>
In figure 3 the printed circuit board elements/components of the present invention are illustrated. ON/OFF sensing module (4) comprises terminals (Al, A2 and A3). This together is a micro switch where terminals (Al and A2) are closed under normal circumstances (Al and A2 form a NC) . Upon actuation terminals (Al and A2) gets disconnected and contact is formed with terminals (Al and A3).<br>
This micro switch gets actuated in ON condition only. So in OFF condition terminals (Al and A2) remain connected and in ON condition terminals (Al and A3) get connected.<br>
Further referring to the figure 3, TRIP sensing module (4) comprises terminals (Bl, B2 and B3). This together is a micoswitch where terminals (Bl and B3} are closed under normal circumstances (Bl and B3 form a NC) . Upon actuation terminals (Bl and B3) gets disconnected and contact is formed with terminals (Bl and B2).<br>
So, this micro switch gets actuated in TRIP condition and here terminals (Bl and B2) get connected while otherwise terminals (Bl and B3) remain connected.<br>
Further the light emitting diodes (9Da, 9D2/ 9D3) used had three terminals, two active and other neutral ...2 (no. as 1 and 2) power and lneutral ( no. as 3). Here if power is fed to terminals 1 (and 3 since it is neutral) , LED glows in RED (9D0 . If Power is fed to 2 (and 3 since it is neutral) , LED glows in GREEN (9D2) and if power is fed to 1 &amp; 2 (and 3 since it is neutral) , LED glows in AMBER (9D3) .<br>

10 NOV 2005<br><br>
WORKING<br>
In ON , contacts Al,A2 gets connected and hence the circuit gets closed through A1-A2 and goes to terminal 1 of LED and thus makes it make glow in RED (9Di) .<br>
In OFF state A1,A3 gets connected and Al Bl gets internally connected. The circuit gets closed through Al-Bl and goes to terminal no. 2 and glows in GREEN (9D2) •<br>
Under TRIP condition,  terminals B1/B2 gets connected hence power goes to terminal no. 1 of LED via A1-B1-B2 route while power goes to terminal No. 2 of LED via Al-Bl route. Since power goes to both terminal no. 1 and 2 , LED glows in AMBER (9D3) .<br>
The invention has been described in a preferred form only and many variations may be made in the invention which will still be comprised within its spirit. The invention is not limited to the details cited above. For example, different light emitting diodes of varied colours may be used and the same results may be achieved. The handle descried in the present case is transparent. Translucent handle may used still the invention can be performed. In the present case three states namely, ON, OFF and TRIP is denoted. However, varying the number of PCBs the sensing of the state of the device can be differed. The invention has been described for a circuit breaker but the actuator arrangement may also be applicable in case of switch fuse disconnector and the like and still be considered to be within the spirit of the invention.<br>
