FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an "Audible warning device for side stand assembly of two wheelers".<br>
PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE<br>
Following description explain various technologies known in the art, the problem associated with prior art and the solution offered by the invention to circumvent the problem associated with it.<br>
In any two-wheeler, normally side stand is provided for parking the vehicle. In the normal circumstances the rider releases the side stand using his feet and start the vehicle for moving forward. If side stand is not released, there is every possibility of the vehicle meeting with an accident during the forward motion of the vehicle. This is overcome by providing a switch warning system. The device consists of a plunger type switch operated by the side stand being connected to the ignition switch and a bulb on the speedometer panel by electrical means. When the ignition switch is "ON" and if the side stand is not released the circuit is closed and current flows to the bulb making it glow cautioning the rider. Most of the time this caution is unnoticed by the rider especially during the daytime making it less safe. This is overcome by another known art in which, an audible piezo ceramic beeper is used to caution the rider. When the ignition switch is ON and the side stand is in the ON position, current is drawn by the piezo electric beeper and makes an audible sound, which can be heard by the rider. When the side stand is in the OFF position or released position no current is drawn by the beeper and no sound will be heard.<br>
However in the above mentioned system with beeper, there is a draw back. The side stand and the switch operated by the stand are fixed on the lower most part of the vehicle. These assemblies are prone to water entry during rainy season while riding on potholes and during water wash at the time of servicing. Due to this the switch can malfunction since water may conduct electricity. So even when the side stand is in the OFF position, due to the electric conduction of water a very low current is sufficient to activate the beeper and will give false alarm to rider while riding. Though it is possible to provide a leak proof joint and enclosure to<br><br>
avoid water entry, these solutions are not cost effective and not fool proof. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a foolproof system, which is capable of solving this problem.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
For solving the aforementioned problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a reed relay, which is electrically connected to the 12V supply and'the beeper through the side stand switch. The reed relay will close the circuit only when the required voltage is supplied to the system causing the beeper to activate and makes an audible sound. Any leakage caused by the water entry will not operate the reed relay and therefore the beeper will not give any sound.<br>
At the outset of the description, which follows, it is to be understood that ensuring description only illustrate a particular form of this invention. However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a novel audible warning device for side stand assembly of two wheelers.<br>
It is another object of invention is to invent a device, which is sturdy, effective and economical.<br>
The above and other objects features and disadvantages will be clear from the following description of preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.<br>
The foregoing description is outlined rather broadly preferred and alternative feature of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a<br><br>
basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
The invention will now be explained with reference to the drawing, which accompany the complete specification. The nature of the invention and the manner by which the invention is performed is clearly described in the complete specification. The description will be with reference to preferred embodiment shown in the illustration,.<br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiment<br>
Figure 1 - Electrical circuit diagram of the proposed invention<br>
The Figure 1 consists of a side stand switch SW2, encapsulated housing H which houses a beeper B and reed relay R connected through a reed switch RE. The 12V supply is fed to the reed relay R through Ignition switch SW1 and the side stand switch SW2.<br>
When the Ignition switch SW1 is ON, and when the stand is in the ON position, the stand switch SW2 is closed and current flows to the reed relay R and the reed switch RE will close.<br>
Through the reed switch RE, the required 12V is supplied to the beeper B that in turn will give audible sound. Any amount of leakage through the side stand switch SW2 in case of water entry, will not operate the reed relay R since the relay requires more current than the leakage current. Thus false alarm of beeper is eliminated.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention, which come within the scope of the following claims, are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br><br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	Audible warning device for side stand assembly of two wheelers comprising a reed<br>
relay, said reed relay being electrically connected to the 12V supply and the beeper<br>
through the side stand switch, the said relay will close the circuit only when the<br>
required voltage is supplied to the system causing the beeper to activate and makes<br>
an audible sound, and any leakage caused by the water entry will not operate the<br>
reed relay such that the beeper will not give any sound.<br>
2.	Audible warning device for side stand assembly of two wheelers as claimed in claim 1<br>
wherein a side stand switch, encapsulated housing which houses a beeper and reed<br>
relay connected through a reed switch, the 12V supply is fed to the reed relay through<br>
Ignition switch and the side stand switch.<br>
3.	Audible warning device for side stand assembly of two wheelers as described in the<br>
complete specification and as illustrated by way of drawings<br><br></td>
