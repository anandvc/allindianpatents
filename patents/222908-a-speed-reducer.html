				<td>A SPEED REDUCER<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a speed reducer and more specifically to a speed reducer<br>
having at least a first, second and a third reduction stage arranged in a cascade.<br>
Technological background<br>
The invention applies particularly to the specific field of speed reducers comprising at least<br>
three reduction stages of which the first is constituted by a pair of perpendicular gears, the second by<br>
an epicyclic reduction unit, and the third by a pair of parallel annular gears, the whole forming a<br>
reducer with an input and an output which are perpendicular to one another.<br>
The term "reducer" is used in this context in its most general meaning of a transmission<br>
member which can operate both in a multiplying condition and in a reducing condition between a<br>
main drive-input shaft and a main drive-output shaft.<br>
In the specific constructional implementation of reducers of the type indicated, the drive is<br>
brought to the sun gear of the epicyclic reduction unit by means of a shaft which extends through the<br>
hollow pinion of the final pair of annular gears. This particular configuration is not the subject of<br>
this patent since it is already known and described in Italian patent No. 1307377.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a reducer with perpendicular axes<br>
which has particularly small transverse dimensions and which at the same time involves greater<br>
constructional simplification than known solutions.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention by means of a speed reducer of the above-mentioned<br>
type. Accordingly, the present invention provides a speed reducer comprising at least a first, a<br>
second, and a third reduction stage, arranged in cascade, the first stage comprising a pair of gears<br>
with perpendicular axes, the second stage comprising an epicyclic reduction unit with a sun gear and<br>
respective planetary gears kinematically connected thereto, the third stage comprising a pair of gears<br>
with parallel axes, the drive-input shaft of the first stage and the drive-output shaft of the third stage<br>
constituting the drive-input and drive-output shafts of the reducer, respectively, and having respective<br>
perpendicular axes, the drive-input shaft of the third stage being hollow and housing coaxially the<br>
drive-input shaft of the second, epicyclic reduction stage, the first reduction stage comprising a<br>
bevel-gear/pinion pair, the bevel gear being fixed for rotation with the drive-input shaft of the<br>
second stage, at the end axially remote from the position of mounting of the second reduction stage,<br>
the bevel gear being supported rotatably in the reducer at a pair of support points, characterized in<br>
that bearing support is provided at one of the support points, the bevel gear being supported at the<br>
other support point by the self-centring supporting effect produced on the sun gear by the epicyclic<br>
reduction unit, the sun gear being restrained coaxially on the drive-input shaft of the second stage, at<br>
the end axially remote from the position of mounting of the bevel gear.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
The characteristics and the advantages of the invention will become clearer from the detailed<br>
description of two preferred embodiments thereof which are described by way of non-limiting<br>
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
- Figure 1 is a schematic view, in axial section, of a speed reducer formed in accordance with<br>
a first embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
- Figure 2 is a schematic view, in axial section, of a second embodiment of the reducer<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
With initial reference to Figure 1, a speed reducer formed in accordance with the invention<br>
and generally indicated 1 comprises a housing 2 inside which a first, a second, and a third reduction<br>
stage, indicated 3, 4 and 5, respectively, are housed at least partially.<br>
The housing 2 comprises structurally independent portions 2a, 2b and 2c which can be<br>
connected to one another releasably to define the housing 2 for containing the reduction stages.<br>
The first reduction stage 3 comprises a pair of gears 6, 7 which have perpendicular axes<br>
arranged on axes Y, Z, respectively, and which are advantageously produced in the form of a bevel<br>
gear and a pinion, respectively, meshed with one another and keyed to respective shafts 8, 9.<br>
The shaft 9 constitutes the main drive-input shaft of the reducer 1 and is supported by<br>
bearings 9a, 9b.<br>
The bevel gear 6 is fixed for rotation with the shaft 8 about the axis Y by<br>
means of a firm coupling, for example, an interference coupling, at one<br>
end 8a of the shaft 8. The shaft 8 is also arranged to be rendered perfectly<br>
coaxial with the bevel gear 6 by suitable centring means formed in the<br>
mutually coupled members.<br>
The shaft 8 constitutes the drive-input shaft of the second reduction<br>
stage 4. This stage comprises an epicyclic reducer with a sun gear 10 which<br>
is fixed firmly to the end 8b of the shaft 8 axially remote from the end 8a, for<br>
example, by being produced integrally therewith or by keying. The sun gear<br>
10 is meshed with a plurality of planetary gears 11 which are mounted on a<br>
spider 12 in conventional manner and also mesh with a ring gear 13 fixed to<br>
the housing 2. The spider 12 in turn is coupled for rotation with a drive-input<br>
shaft 14 of the third stage. The shaft 14 is supported in the housing 2 by<br>
bearings 14a, 14b provided at its opposite axial ends. A pinion 15 is fixed for<br>
rotation with the shaft 14, for example, by being produced integrally<br>
therewith. The pinion 15 in turn meshes with an annular gear 16 keyed to a<br>
respective shaft 17. The shaft 17 is supported for rotation in the housing 2<br>
about its own axis of rotation X by means of respective bearings 17a, 17b. It<br>
constitutes the main drive-output shaft of the reducer 1 and is hollow to<br>
permit hollow-shaft coupling with the driven shafts disposed downstream of<br>
the reduction unit, if desired.<br>
It is pointed out that the shaft 14 is hollow axially and the drive-input<br>
shaft 8 of the second epicyclic reduction stage is housed therein with ample<br>
radial clearance.<br>
According to a principal characteristic of the invention, the bevel gear 6<br>
is supported rotatably in the housing 2 at a pair of support points at the first<br>
of which, in the region of the end 8a of the shaft 8, a bearing 18, preferably<br>
of the rolling type, is provided. The second support point of the gear 6,<br>
together with the shaft 8, is formed by the self-centring supporting effect<br>
produced on the sun gear 10 by the planetary gears 11 that are meshed with<br>
the sun gear. By virtue of this self-centring supporting effect, which is typical<br>
of epicyclic reduction units, the second support point in the region of the end<br>
8b of the shaft 8 does not require the provision of any bearing-type support<br>
means or a respective housing seat in the housing 2; this has the advantage<br>
of a reduced transverse dimension and a considerable constructional<br>
simplification. To ensure adequate support of the bevel gear 6, this gear 6 is<br>
arranged to be connected rigidly to the shaft 8, for example, by the<br>
interference fixing described above.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of a reducer according to the<br>
present invention. The reducer of the second embodiment is generally<br>
indicated 20 and details similar to those of the previous embodiment are<br>
marked by the same reference numerals.<br>
The reducer 20 differs from the reducer 1 of the first embodiment in<br>
that the bevel gear 6, together with the drive-Input shaft 8 of the epicyclic<br>
reduction stage, is further supported at a third point by a support, preferably<br>
of the rolling type, in which a bearing 21 is provided. The bearing 21 is<br>
arranged axially in a position between the bearing 18 and the support zone in<br>
the region of the sun gear 10.<br>
Moreover, the bearing 21 is interposed radially between the hollow<br>
shaft 14 and the shaft 8 and is preferably housed in the axiai cavity defined<br>
inside the shaft 14. This solution can advantageously be adopted when the<br>
self-centring effect of the sun gear 10 is not of sufficient magnitude.<br>
In this variant of the invention, the bevel gear 6 is also advantageously<br>
arranged to be fixed for rotation with the shaft 8 about the axis Y by means<br>
of a torsional coupling, for example, of the type with a spiined profile 22 and<br>
in any case such as to ensure the concentricity of the coupling. This coupling<br>
is formed in the axial portion that is disposed between the support bearings<br>
18 and 21. The bearing 21 advantageously comprises rolling bodies of the<br>
needle type 23 and, again in order to reduce transverse dimensions, the<br>
needle races may be formed directly on (facing) internal and external surface<br>
portions of the shafts 14 and 8, respectively.<br>
The concentric arrangement of the bearings 21 and 14a is also pointed<br>
out. In practice, the shaft 8 is supported by the stationary portion of the<br>
housing 2 by means of the pair of concentric bearings 14a, 21, As a result,<br>
the bevel gear 6 is also supported at: a pair of opposed points located in the<br>
regions of the bearings 18 and 21. This supporting effect advantageously<br>
allows the bearing 18 to be of small dimensions since it is assisted by the<br>
bearing 21, acting as a second support. Moreover, since the bearing 21 is<br>
housed inside the pinion 15, the transverse dimensions are significantly<br>
reduced and considerably less than they would be if a second bearing were<br>
provided, mounted conventionally with a suitable housing formed in the<br>
stationary structure of the reducer housing. The advantage connected with<br>
greater simplification of construction (and of the number of components) in<br>
comparison with conventional configurations should also be noted.<br>
The invention thus achieves the object proposed, affording the<br>
advantages indicated over known solutions.<br>
