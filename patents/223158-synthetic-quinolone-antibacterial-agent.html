				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a synthetic quinolone antibacterial agent which is useful as medicaments, veterinary drugs, drugs for fishery use, or antibacterial preservatives.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Since the discovery of norfloxacin, synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents have been improved in antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics, and many compounds are now used in the clinical filed as chemotherapeutic agents which are effective for in almost systemic infectious diseases.<br>
In recent years, generation of bacteria having low sensitivity to synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents have been increasing in clinical situations. For example, like the case of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pneumococcus (PRSP) which are insusceptible to Î²-lactam antibiotics and Enterococcus (VRE) which is insusceptible to aminoglycoside antibacterial agents, a case has been increasing in which a gram-positive bacteria originally resistant to drugs other than synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents also became low sensitive to synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents. In consequence, synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents having<br><br>
higher efficacy are thus being demanded in clinical situations.<br>
With regard to the side effects of synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents, in addition to the central nervous system stimulation effect, which has been a problem since priorly, the induction of convulsion resulting from combined use with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phototoxicity, etc, have also become known, and the development of synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents having higher safety is thus also being demanded.<br>
It is known that the structure of the substituents at the 7-position and l-position (or positions corresponding to these positions; the same shall apply hereinafter) have a large influence on the antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, and safety of synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents.<br>
Quinolone derivatives, having a pyrrolidinyl group having an aminomethyl group at the 3-position, as the substituent at the 7-position of the quinolone mother skeleton, are known to exhibit strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. For example, there are 7-[3-(l-aminomethyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives [Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 29, p. 445 (1986)].<br>
Furthermore, known examples of quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives having a substituent on the carbon atom of the aminomethyl group of the 3-(1-aminomethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl<br><br>
group include 7-[3-(l-aminoethyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives [Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 36, p, 871 (1993)]; 7-[3-(1-amino-l-<br>
methYlethyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives [Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol, 37, p. 733 (1994)]; and 7-[3-(l-aminoalkyl)pyrrolidin"l-yl]quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives [Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, vol. 42, p. 1442 (1994)], etc.<br>
However, though the abovementioned quinolone derivatives, having a 3- (aminomethyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl group, a 3-(l-aminoethyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl group, or a group having a structure similar to these as a substituent, are compounds which exhibit strong antibacterial activity, it has been found that due to the low selective toxicity [see for example. Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, vol. 33, p. 685 (1994)], these compounds act not only on bacteria but also on the cells of eukaryotic organisms, and they are difficult to use as medical drugs or as veterinary drugs. Therefore, quinolone compounds having these substituents have not been put to actual clinical use up until now.<br>
Meanwhile, quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, which have a 3- (1-aminocycloalJcyl) pyrrolidin-1-yl group as a substituent and are relevant to the present invention, have been described in the form of a broad concept in PCT/JP96/00208, which provides a description of compounds with the structure shown<br><br>
in formula A or formula B. That is, with a quinolone compound of formula A, the substituent (X1) at the 6-position is defined as being a halogen atom or a hydrogen atom. However, only quinolone carboxylic acids wherein the fluorine atom or other halogen atom is the substituent at the 6-position are disclosed specifically in the abovementioned patent application. Therefore, PCT/JP96/00208 does not provide a specific description concerning quinolone carboxylic acids wherein hydrogen is substituted at the 6-position. Furthermore, this publication does not provide any specific disclosure as embodiments of 3-(l-aminocycloalkyl)pyrrolidinyl-substituted-e-hydrogen-substituted-quinolone carboxylic acids, wherein the present invention is concerned. [Formula A]<br><br>

(The definitions of the substituents in the compound shown in formula A are those given in PCT/JP96/00208 and are irrelevant to the definitions of substituents of the present invention even when the same symbols are used.)]<br>

(The definitions of the substituents in the compound shown in formula B are those given in PCT/JP96/00208 and are irrelevant to the definitions of substituents of the present invention even when the same symbols are used.)]<br>

However, even this literature does not contain any description whatsoever concerning 3-(l-aminocycloalkyl)pyrrolidinyl-substituted-6-hydrogen-substituted-quinolone carboxylic acids, which are the compounds of the present invention.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies to obtain quinolone compounds, which are excellent in antibacterial activity, high in efficacy, and yet excellent in safety â¢ As a resul t, it has been found that 3- (l-aminocycloalkyl)pyrrolidinYl-substituted-6-dehalogeno (hydrogen-substituted) quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives representedby formula (I) describedbelow, its salts and hydrates thereof exhibit potent antibacterial activity upon a broad range of gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria and, in particular, exhibit potent antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacteria, as represented by gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, PRSP, and VRE,<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that, in addition to exhibiting such excellent antibacterial activity, the compounds of this invention are excellent both in terms of safety and pharmacokinetics and thus enable use in clinical situations, which could not be achieved with compounds prior to this invention which have substituents of the same structure at the 7-position of the quinolone mother skeleton. The present invention has been achieved based on these findings.<br>
A comparison of the 6-hydrogen-substituted-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives representedby formula (I) , its salts and hydrates thereof according to the present invention with quinolone compounds wherein the hydrogen at the 6-position of a compound of this invention is substituted by a fluorine atom<br><br>
shows that both types of compounds exhibit excellent antibacterial activity upon a broad range of both gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant bacteria. However, it has been found unexpectedly that the 6-hydrogen-substituted-quinolone derivatives, which are the compounds of this invention, are compounds that, in comparison to the 6-fluorine-substituted-quinolone derivatives, are compounds of excellent safety that are reduced in acute toxicity and significantly reduced in micronuclus induction, and also exhibit good pharmacokinetics, such as improved urinary recovery, etc.<br>
That is, the present inventors have found that even a quinolone compound, which has a 3-(l-aminocycloalkyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl group having a cyclic alkyl group as a substituent on the methyl group of the 3- (aminomethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl group and which as has been mentioned above is known to be low in selective toxicity, will unexpectedly be a compound with excellent selective toxicity and be a compound of excellent pharmacokinetics as long as it is a quinolone compound with the structure of the present invention.<br>

Antibacterial activities of the compounds of this invention were measured in accordance to the standard method designated by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy, with the results shown as MIC values (microgram/ml) units in the following table. For comparison with the MIC values of the compounds of this invention, MIC values of levofloxacin (LVFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and 7-[3- (R) -(l-aminocyclopropyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-fluoro-1-[2-(S)-fluoro-1-(R)-cyclopropyl]-8-methyl-l,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (Reference drug 1) , which is described in PCT/JP96/00208, are also shown in the table .<br><br><br><br>
[Test Example 2]<br>
For the compound described as Example 1 of this invention, the micronucleus test in bone marrow of mice was performed by the following method.<br>
Mice groups, each consisting of five, six-week-old, Slc:ddY male mice, were used.  The compound of this invnetion described as Example 1 and 7-[3-(R)-(l-aminocyclopropyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-fluoro-l-[2-(S)-fluoro-l-(R)-cyclopropyl]-8-methyl-l,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (Reference drug 1) described in PCT/JP96/00208 were dissolved in and diluted with O.lmol/1 NaOH/saline solution.  The O.lmol/1 NaOH/saline solvent was used as a control, and as a positive Reference drug, a drug solution, prepared by dissolving and diluting cyclophosphamide (CP) in saline solution, was used. All drug solutions were disinfected by filtration through Mylex GS 0.22pm filters. With each drug solution, a single intravenous dose of 10ml/kg was administered at an administration rate of 0,2ml/min. 24 hours after administration, myeloma cells were collected from the femur bone, the smear preparations were prepared, and these were dyed with acrylic orange. Using a fluorescence microscope, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes were observed for each individual mouse,  and the frequency of occurrence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes and the ratio of orthochromatic erythrocytes and polychromatic erythrocytes<br><br>
among 1000 erythrocytes were calculated.<br>
As a result, a significant difference in the micronucleus induction rate was not seen between the control and any of the 25, 50, and 100mg/kg administration groups for the compound described as Example 1 and the judgment result was thus negative. That is, the compound described as Example 1 was found to be extremely weak in micronucleus induction and high in safety.<br>
In contrast, with the comparison compound, 7-[3-(R)-(l-aminocyclopropyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-fluoro-l-[ 2-(S)-fluoro-1-(R)-cyGlopropyl]-8-methyl-l,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-Garboxylic acid (Reference drug 1) described in PCT/JP96/00208, micronucleus induction in comparison to the control was clearly seen with the 50 and 100mg/kg administration groups.<br>
These results show that the compound described as Example 1 of this invention, wherein a fluorine atom of the 6-position of the comparison compound, 7-[3-(R)-(l-<br>
aminocyclopropyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-fluoro-l-[2-(S)-fluoro -1-(R)-cyclopropyl]-8-methyl-l,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid described in PCT/JP96/00208 is replaced by a hydrogen atom, exhibits a potent antibacterial action upon a broad range of both gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria, including resistant bacteria, and yet is high in safety. [Test Example 3]<br><br>
For the compound of this invention described as Example 1, the blood concentration and organ concentration after oral administration were determined by the following methods. Measurements were also made by the same methods for Reference drug 1. Method 1: Animal Tests<br>
An administration solution was prepared by dissolving a tested compound to a concentration of 2mg/ml (as free compound) in distilled water, and using a 2.5ml disposable syringe or a metal oral probe, the solution was orally administered at a dose of 20mg/kg to fasting rats (Cr j : CDIGS;male; 7-week-old; Charles River Japan, Inc.).<br>
The absorption test groups (4 rats per group; total of 6 groups) were killed by exsanguination while under ether anesthetization 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 6 hours after drug administration, and the blood, liver, kidneys, and lungs were sampled. With the blood, serum was sampled by centrifugation (3000rpm x 15 minutes, 4Â°C) after coagulation. Tissues were homogenized after adding 3 to 5ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer solution (pH7.0) and the centrifugation supernatants (SOOOrmpm X 15 minutes, 4Â°C) were collected.<br>
The excretion test groups (4 rats per group) were put in a metabolic cage after drug administration, and collected urine samples for 0 to 4 hours and 4 to 24 hours were sampled while cooling with ice, and at the time of sampling, the interior<br><br>
of the cage was washed with approximately 15ml of 0.1mol/1 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) to recover the urine attached to the interior of the cage. Also in order to examine glucuronide and other conjugated compounds, a part of the sample was separated, hydrolyzed with an equivalent amount of lmol/1 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and thereafter neutralized with 0.5mol/l hydrochloric acid, and concentration measurements were made on samples prepared in this manner. Method 2: Drug Concentration Measurements<br>
Determination of drug concentrations in liquid samples were quantified by an agar well method bioassay using the B. subtilis ATCC6051 strain as the test organism. A test medium was prepared by inoculating a suspension containing 5 x lO^CFU/ml of spores of the test bacteria at a proportion of 1% into an nutrient agar (Eiken Kagaku) that was sterilized at 121Â°C for 15 minutes and then cooled to approximately 50Â°C. After placing lOml each of this medium in a sterilized Petri dish and solidifying horizontally, four holes of 8mm diameter were made to prepare a test plate medium. The Bioassay System TDA-1 (Dainippon Seiki) was used for preparation of the test plate media. For the measurements, the test saimples (diluted with serum or phosphate buffer solution as necessary), serial dilutions of the drug solutions for calibration (two-fold serial dilutions prepared so that the inhibition ring diameter will be approximately 10 to 30mm) , and a reference drug solution<br><br>
(a drug solution of given concentration for correction of the error among plates; normally, a concentration of forming an inhibition ring of approximately 20mm is used) were prepared,<br>
and 50ÂµL of the test sample (or the drug solution for calibration) were placed in each of two of the four holes of each plate and<br>
50ÂµL of the reference solution was placed in each of the other two holes. After addition of the sample, the plate medium was<br>
set still for 1 hour at 4Â°C to perform preliminary dispersion and then culturing at 37Â°C was performed for approximately 18 hours, and the inhibition ring diameters were measured using CA-400 (Dainippon Seiki). The concentrations of the test samples were measured using a calibration curve determined by second-order regression from the logarithmic values of the drug concentration of the calibration curve serial dilutions and the inhibition ring diameters.<br>
For the tissue concentration (Âµg/ml) , the concentration (M-g/ml) in the homogenate supernatant was determined from the tissue weight (g) and the added phosphate buffer amount (ml) and using the following equation:<br>
[Tissue concentration] = [Homogenate concentration] x ([Tissue weight] + [Buffer solution amount])/[Tissue weight]<br>
The urinary excretion rate (%) was determined from the amount (Âµg) of drug administered, amount (ml) of urine (or washing solution), and concentration (Âµg/ml) in urine (or washing solution):<br><br>
[Urinary excretion rate] = 100 x ([Amount of urine] x [Concentration in urine])/[Amount of drug administered] Method 3: Calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters<br>
For each drug, the pharmacokinetic parameters in rats were calculated based on mean concentration, by non-compartmental analysis, and using the pharmacodynamics analysis software, PSAG-CP (Asmedica).<br>
The serum concentration and the organ concentration for liver, kidneys, and lungs of the compound of Example 1 and Reference drug 1, determined by the above methods, are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
As is apparent from Table 2, the compound of this invention was found to be distributed at higher concentrations, for both serum and tissue, in comparison to Reference drug 1. It is thus apparent that the compound of this invention is excellent in oral absorption. It is also apparent that the compound of this invention is excellent in tissue penetration.<br>
The structures of the compounds that were compared in activities are as follows.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Compounds of this invention exhibit excellent antibacterial action upon a broad range of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and, in particular, exhibit potent antibacterial activity even against resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) , penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) , vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), etc., and quinolone-resistant bacteria, and yet are excellent in safety<br><br>
characteristics, such as being negative in micronucleus tests, and excellent in pharmacokinetics, such as being improved in urinary recovery rates and being excellent in oral absorption and tissue penetration, etc. The compounds of this invention are thus useful as antibacterial compounds to be used in chemotherapy against microbial infections.<br><br><br><br><br>
