				<td>The present invention relates to a pyrrolidine compound of general formula (1)<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD <br>
The present invention relates to a pyrrolidine compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Three types of monoamines, known as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, act as neurotransmitters in organisms. Therefore, pharmaceuticals having a monoamine reuptake inhibitory effect are widely used as therapeutic pharmaceuticals for diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems.<br>
Many of the pharmaceuticals used to date for treating depression selectively inhibit norepinephrine or serotonin reuptake. Examples of such pharmaceuticals include imipramine (a first-generation antidepressant), maprotiline (a second-generation antidepressant), selective serotonin-uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine (SSRI, third-generation antidepressants), serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine (SNRI, fourth-generation antidepressants), and the like (see Sadanori Miura, Rinshoseishinyakuri (Japanese Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology), 2000, 3: 311-318).<br>
However, it takes at least three weeks for these pharmaceuticals to exhibit their therapeutic effects and furthermore, these pharmaceuticals fail to exhibit sufficient effects in about 30% of patients suffering from depression (see Phil Skolnick, European Journal of Pharmacology, 2001, 375: 31-40) .<br>

trifluoromethylphenyl)amine difumarate<br>
To a 1,2-dichloromethane solution  (1 ml)  containing ((S)-l-benzylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-(3-fluorophenyl)-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)amine  (0.48 g,  1.1 mmol)  was added 1-chloroethyl chloroformate (0.82 g, 5.8 mmol).  The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 hours and heated under reflux for 3 hours. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and 5 ml methanol was then added to the residue and heated under reflux for 3 hours.   After distilling the solvent off under reduced  pressure,   the  residue  was  then  dissolved  in dichloromethane and washed with an aqueous saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution.  After drying over magnesium sulfate, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethanol, fumaric acid (128 mg, 1.1 mmol) was then added thereto, giving a uniform solution.  The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the crystals produced by adding dichloromethane to the residue were separated by filtration and dried, giving 0.24 g of light brown powdery (3-fluorophenyl)-(S)-pyrrolidin-3-yl-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)amine difumarate.<br>

serotonin (5-HT) uptake into rat brain synaptosome<br>
Male Wistar rats were decapitated and the brains were removed and the frontal cortices were dissected. The separated frontal cortices were homogenized in 20 volumes as weight of 0.32 M sucrose solution by a Potter-type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at lOOOg at 4°C for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 20000g at 4°C for 20 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in incubation buffer (20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)) containing 10 mM glucose, 145 mM sodium chloride, 4.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.2 mM magnesium chloride, and 1.5 mM calcium chloride) and used as crude synaptosome fractions.<br>
The uptake reaction mixture was suspended in a final volume of 200 µl containing pargyline (final concentration of 10 µM) and sodium ascorbate (final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) in each well of 96-well-round-bottom-plate.<br>
Solvent, unlabeled 5-HT, and serial diluted test compounds were added in each well, and synaptosome fraction of 1/10 volume of the final volume were added. After a 10 min preincubation at 37°C, the uptake was initiated by the addition of tritium-labeled 5-HT solution (final concentration of 8 nM) at 37 °C. The uptake was stopped after 10 minutes by filtration under vacuum through a 96-well glass fiber filter plate. After washing the filter with cold physiological saline and drying up, Microscint-0 (Perkin-Elmer) was added, and remained radioactivity on the filter was measured.<br>
The total uptake activity with only solvent was determined as 100%, and the nonspecific uptake activity with unlabeled 5-HT (final concentration of 10 µM) was determined as 0%. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were calculated based on the concentrations of the test compounds and their<br><br>

Pharmacological Test 4 Forced-swimming test<br>
Forced-swimming test was conducted based on the method of Porsolt,  R.D.,  et al.  (Porsolt,  R.D.,  et al.,<br>
Behavioural despair in mice: A primary screening test for antidepressants. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 229, pp 327-336 (1977) with a modification.<br>
The test compound was suspended in a 5% gum arabic/physiological saline solution (w/v) and then orally administered to male ICR mice (provided by Clea Japan Inc., 5 to 6 weeks old) . One hour after administration, the mice were dropped into a tank containing 9.5 cm water maintained at 21 to 25°C. Then, the mice were forced to swim for 6 minutes. During the last four minutes of the test, the period of time the mice were not moving was measured (i.e., immobility time). The analysis and measurement of the immobility time was conducted using a SCANET MV-20 AQ system (product name of Melquest Co., Ltd.).<br>
In this test, the test compound treated animal exhibited reduction of immobility time. Therefore it is clear that the test compound is effective as an antidepressant.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
