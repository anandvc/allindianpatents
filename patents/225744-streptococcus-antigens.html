COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"STREPTOCOCCUS ANTIGENS*<br>
ID BIOMEDICAL CORPORATION; of 525 Cartier Boulevard West, Laval, Quebec H7V 3S8, Canada;<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to antigens, epitopes and 5 antibodies directed to these epitopes, more ■particularly polypeptide antigens of streptococcus pneumoniae pathogen which may be useful for. prophylaxis, diagnostic or treatment of streptococcal infection.<br>
10<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
S. pneumoniae is an important agent of disease in man especially among infants, the elderly and immunocompromised persons.  It is a bacterium frequently isolated from patients<br>
15  with  invasive . diseases  such'  as  bacteraemia/septicaemia, pneumonia,  meningitis  with  high  morbidity  and  mortality throughout  the world.    Even with appropriate  antibiotic therapy-, pneumococcal infections  still result in many deaths. Although the advent of antimicrobial drugs has reduced the<br>
20 overall mortality from pneumococcal disease, the presence of resistant pneumococcal organisms has become a major problem in the world today. Effective pneumococcal vaccines could have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality associated with S. pneumoniae disease.  Such vaccines would also potentially be<br>
25  useful to prevent otitis media in infants and young children.-<br>
Efforts to develop a pneumococcal vaccine have generally concentrated on generating immune responses to the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide.  More than 80 pneumococcal capsular<br>
30 serotypes have been identified on the basis of antigenic differences. The currently available pneumococcal vaccine, comprising 23 capsular polysaccharides that, most frequently caused disease, has significant shortcomings related primarily to the poor immunogenicity of some capsular polysaccharides,<br>
35 the diversity of the serotypes and the differences in the distribution of serotypes over time, geographic areas and age<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
groups. In particular, the failure of existing vaccines and capsular conjugate vaccines currently in development to protect young children against all serotypes spurres evaluation of other S^ pneumoniae components. Although immunogenicity of 5 capsular polysaccharides can be improved, serotype specificity will still represent a major limitation of polysaccharide-based vaccines. The use of a antigenically conserved immunogenic pneumococcal protein antigen, either by itself or in combination with additional components, offers the possibility 10  of a protein-based pneumococcal vaccine.<br>
K	^ ;<br>
PCT WO 98/1893&amp; published May 7, 1998 entitled "Streptococcus' Pneumoniae       antigens   and  vaccines"   describes   certain polypeptides which are claimed to be antigenic. However, no 15  biological  activity  of  these  polypeptides  is  reported. Similarly, no sequence conservation is reported, which is a necessary species common vaccine candidate.<br>
PCT /WO 00/39299'describes polypeptides and polynucleotides 20  encoding these polypeptides. PCT WO 00/39299 demonstrates that polypeptides designated as BVH-3 and BVH-11 provide protection against fatal experimental infection with pneumococci.<br>
Therefore there remains an unmet need for Streptococcus 25  antigens that may be used as components for the prophylaxis, diagnostic and/or therapy of Streptococcus infection.<br>

5  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It was determined that portions of the BVH-3 and BVH-11 polypeptides were internal. Other portions were not present in important strains such as encapsulated s.pneumonia causing<br>
10 disease strains. It would be advantageous to have a polypeptide that comprises a portion that is not internal. When large portions of a polypeptide are internal, these portions, are not exposed on the bacteria. However, these portions can be very immunogenic in a recombinant polypeptide<br>
15 and will not confer protection against infections. It would also be advantageous to have a polypeptide that comprises a portion that is present in most strains.<br>
The present invention is concerned with polypeptides in which 20  undesired portions have been deleted and/or modified in order to obtain a specific immune response.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there are also provided  polypeptides  or  polynucleotides  encoding  such 25  polypeptides comprising protective domains.<br>
Surprisingly, when the undesired portion of the polypeptides are deleted or modified, the polypeptides have desired biological properties. This is surprising in view of the fact<br>
30  that some of these portions were described as being epitope bearing portion in the patent application PCT WO 98/18930. In, other publications such as PCT WO 00/37105, portions- identified as histidine triad and coil coiled regions were said to be of importance. The present inventors have found that variants of<br>
35  the polypeptide BVH-3 and BVH-11 in which certain portions were deleted and/or modified and chimeras of these polypeptides have<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334	PCT/CA01/00908<br>
biological properties and generate a specific immune response.<br>

Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms<br>
used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by<br>
35  one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention<br>
belongs. All publications, patent applications, patents, and<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are 5  illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, "protection" in the biological studies is defined by a significant increase in the survival curve, rate or period. Statistical analysis using the<br>
10 Log rank test to compare survival curves, and Fisher exact test to compare survival rates and numbers of days to death, respectively, might be useful to calculate P values and determine whether the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. P values of 0.05 are regarded as<br>
15  not significant.<br>
As used herein, "fragments", "derivatives" or "analogues" of the polypeptides of the invention include those polypeptides in which  one  or more of  the amino acid residues  are<br>
20 substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably conserved) and which may be natural or unnatural. In one embodiment, derivatives and analogues of polypeptides of the invention will have about 70% identity with those sequences illustrated in the figures or fragments<br>
25 thereof. That is, 70% of the residues are the same. In a further embodiment, polypeptides will have greater than 75% homology. In a further embodiment, polypeptides will have greater than' 80% homology. In a further embodiment, polypeptides will have greater than 85% homology. In a further<br>
30 embodiment, polypeptides will have greater than 90% homology. In a further embodiment, polypeptides will have greater than 95% homology. In a further embodiment, polypeptides will have greater than 99% homology. In a further embodiment, derivatives and analogues of polypeptides of the invention<br>
35  will have less than about 20 amino acid residue substitutions, modifications or deletions and more Dreferably less than 10.<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
Preferred  substitutions  are  those  known  in  the  art  as conserved i.e. the substituted residues share physical, or chemical properties such as hydrophobicity, size, charge or functional groups. 5<br>
The skilled person will appreciate that . analogues or derivatives of the proteins or polypeptides of the invention will also find use in the context of. the present invention, i.e. as antigenic/immunogenic material.  Thus, for instance<br>
\
15  amino acid.<br>
One carl use a program ,such as the CLUSTAL program to compare amino acid sequences. This program compares amino acid sequences and finds the optimal alignment by inserting spaces<br>
20 in either sequence as appropriate. It is possible to calculate amino acid identity or similarity (identity plus conservation of amino acid type) for an optimal alignment. A program like BLASTx will align the longest stretch of similar sequences and assign a value to the fit.  It is thus-possible<br>
25 to obtain a comparison where several regions of similarity are found, each having a different score. Both types of identity analysis are contemplated in the present invention.<br>
In an alternative approach, the analogues or derivatives could 30 be fusion proteins, incorporating moieties which render purification easier, for example by effectively tagging the desired protein or polypeptide, It may be necessary to remove the "tag" or it may be the case'that the fusion protein itself retains sufficient antigenicity to be useful.<br><br><br>

PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
In an additional aspect of the invention there are provided antigenic/immunogenic   fragments   of   the   proteins   or polypeptides of the invention, or of analogues or derivatives thereof. 5<br>
The fragments of the present invention should include one or more such epitopic regions or be sufficiently similar to such regions to retain their antigenic/immunogenic properties. Thus, for fragments according to the present invention the<br>
10 degree of identity is perhaps irrelevant, since they may be 100% identical to a particular part of a' protein or polypeptide, analogue or derivative as described herein. The key issue, once again, is that the fragment retains the antigenic/immunogenic properties.<br>
15<br>
Thus, what is important for analogues, derivatives and fragments is that they possess at least a degree of the antigenicity/immunogenic of the protein or polypeptide from which they are derived,<br>
20<br>
In accordance with the present invention, polypeptides of the invention include both polypeptides and chimeric polypeptides.<br>
Also included are polypeptides which have fused thereto other<br>
25  compounds  which  alter  the  polypeptides  biological  or<br>
pharmacological properties i.e. polyethylene glycol (PEG) to<br>
increase half-life; leader or secretory amino acid sequences<br>
• for ease of purification; prepro- and pro- sequences; and<br>
(poly)saccharides.<br>
30<br>
Furthermore, in those situations where amino acid regions are found to be polymorphic, it may be desirable to vary one or more particular amino acids to more effectively mimic the different epitopes of the different streptococcus strains. 35<br>
Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
modified by terminal -NH2 acylation (e.g. by acetylation, or thiogly'colic acid amidation, terminal carboxy amidation, e.g. with ammonia or methylamine) to provide stability, increased hydrophobicity for linking or binding to a support or other 5  molecule..<br>
' Also contemplated are hetero and homo polypeptide multimers of the polypeptide fragments, analogues and derivatives. These polymeric forms include, for example, one or more polypeptides<br>
10  that have  been cross-linked with cross-linkers such as<br>
■avidin/biotin, gluteraldehyde or dimethylsuperimidate.  Such<br>
polymeric forms also include polypeptides containing two or<br>
more tandem or inverted contiguous sequences, produced from<br>
■multicistronic mRNAs'generated by recombinant DNA technology.<br>
15<br>
Preferably, a fragment, analogue or. derivative of a polypeptide of the invention will comprise at least one antigenic region i.e. at least one epitope.<br>
20. In order to achieve the formation of antigenic polymers (i.e.<br>
synthetic multimers), polypeptides may be. utilised having<br>
bishaloacetyl groups, nitroarylhalides, or the like, where the .reagents being specific for thio groups. Therefore, the link<br>
between two mercapto groups of the different peptides may be a 25  single bond or may be' composed.of a linking group of at least<br>
two, typically at least four, and not more than 16, but<br>
usually not more than about 14 carbon atoms.<br>
In a particular embodiment, polypeptide fragments, analogues 30 and derivatives of the invention do not contain a methionine (Met) starting residue. Preferably, polypeptides will not • incorporate a leader or secretory sequence (signal sequence). The signal portion of a polypeptide of the invention may be determined according to established molecular biological 35 techniques. In general, the polypeptide of interest may be isolated  from  a  streptococcus ' culture  and  subsequently<br><br><br>

PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
sequenced to determine the initial residue of the mature protein and therefore the sequence of the mature polypeptide.<br>

For recombinant production, host cells are • transfected with vectors which encode the polypeptide, and then cultured iri a nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the genes.<br>
10  Suitable vectors are those that are viable and replicable in the chosen host and include chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences e.g. bacterial plasmids, phage DNA, baculovirus, yeast plasmids, vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA.  The polypeptide sequence may be<br>
15 incorporated in the vector at the appropriate site using restriction enzymes such that it is operably linked to an expression control region comprising a promoter, ribosome binding' site (consensus region or Shine-Dalgarno sequence), and optionally an operator (control element). One  can select<br>
20 individual components of the expression control region that are appropriate for a given host and vector according to established molecular biology principles (Sambrook et al.

Suitable promoters include but are not limited to LTR or SV40 promoter, E.coli lac/ tac or trp promoters and the phage lambda Pi, promoter. Vectors will preferably incorporate an origin of replication<br>
30 as well as selection markers i.e. ampicilin resistance gene. Suitable bacterial vectors include pET, pQE70, pQE60, pQE-9, pbs, PD10 phagescript, psixl74, pbluescript SK, pbsks, pNH8A, pNHl6a, pNHlSA, pNH46A, ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, PRIT5 and eukaryotic vectors pBlueBadll, pWLNEO, pSV2CAT,<br>

Upon expression of the polypeptide in culture, cells are 5 typically harvested by centrifugation then disrupted by physical or chemical means (if the expressed polypeptide is not secreted into the media) and the resulting crude extract retained to isolate the polypeptide of interest. Purification of the polypeptide from culture media or lysate may be<br>
10 achieved by established techniques depending on the properties of the polypeptide i.e. using ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation , acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and<br>
15 lectin chromatography. Final purification may be achieved using HPLC.<br>
The polypeptide may be expressed with or without a leader or secretion sequence. In the former case the leader may be 20 removed using post-translational processing (see US 4,431,739; US 4,425,437; and US 4,338,397 incorporated herein by reference) or be chemically removed subsequent to purifying the expressed polypeptide.<br>
25 According to a further aspect, the streptococcus polypeptides of the invention may be used in a diagnostic test for streptococcus infection, in particular S._ pneumoniae infection. Several diagnostic methods are possible, for example detecting streptococcus  organism in a biological<br>
30  sample, the following procedure may be followed: a)obtaining a biological sample from a patient; b)incubating an antibody or fragment thereof reactive with a streptococcus polypeptide of the invention with the biological sample to form a mixture; and<br>
35 c)detecting specifically bound antibody or bound fragment in the. mixture which indicates the presence of streptococcus.<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
Alternatively, a method for the detection of antibody specific to a streptococcus antigen in a biological sample containing or suspected of containing said antibody may be performed as 5  follows:<br>
a)obtaining a biological sample from a patient; b) incubating one or more streptococcus polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof with the biological sample to form a mixture; and 10 c)detecting specifically bound antigen or bound fragment in the mixture which indicates the presence of antibody specific to streptococcus.<br>
One of skill in the art will recognize that this diagnostic<br>
15 test may take several forms, including an immunological test such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) , a radioimmunoassay or a latex agglutination assay, essentially to determine whether antibodies specific for the polypeptide are present in an organism.<br>
20<br>
The DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of the invention may also be used to design DNA probes for use in detecting the presence of streptococcus in a biological sample suspected of containing such bacteria.   The detection method of this<br>
25  invention comprises:<br>
a)obtaining the biological sample from a patient; b)incubating one or • more DNA probes having a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention or fragments thereof with the biological sample to form a mixture; and<br>
30 c)detecting specifically bound DNA probe in the mixture which indicates the presence of streptococcus bacteria.<br>
The DNA probes of this invention may also be used. for<br>
detecting circulating streptococcus i.e. S.pneumoniae nucleic<br>
35  acids in a sample,  for example using a polymerase chain<br>
reaction, as a method of diagnosing streptococcus infections.<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
The probe may be synthesized using conventional techniques and may be immobilized on a solid phase, or may be labelled with a detectable label. A preferred DNA probe for this application is an oligomer having a sequence complementary to at least 5 about 6 contiguous nucleotides of the streptococcus pneumoniae polypeptides of the invention.<br>
1 Another diagnostic method for the detection of streptococcus<br>
in a patient comprises: 10  a)labelling an antibody reactive with a polypeptide of the<br>
invention or fragment thereof with a detectable label;<br>
b)administering the labelled antibody or labelled fragment to<br>
the patient; 'and<br>
c)detecting specifically bound labelled antibody or labelled 15  fragment in the patient which indicates the presence of<br>
streptococcus.<br>
A further  aspect  of  the  invention  is  the  use. of  the' streptococcus polypeptides of the invention as immunogens for<br>
20 the production of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and in particular the treatment of streptococcus infection. Suitable antibodies may be determined using appropriate screening methods, for example by measuring the ability of a particular antibody to passively protect against streptococcus infection<br>
25 in a test model. One example of an animal model is the mouse model described in the examples herein. The antibody may be a whole antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and may belong to any immunoglobulin class. The antibody or fragment may be of animal origin, specifically of mammalian origin and<br>
30 more specifically of murine, rat or human origin. It may be a natural antibody or a fragment thereof, or if desired, a recombinant antibody or antibody fragment. The term recombinant antibody or antibody fragment means antibody or antibody fragment which was produced using molecular biology<br>
35 techniques. The antibody or antibody fragments' may be polyclonal, or preferably monoclonal.  It may be specific for<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
a number of  epitopes associated with the  streptococcus pneumoniae polypeptides but is preferably specific for one.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is the use of the antibodies 5 directed to the streptococcus polypeptides of the invention for passive immunization. .One could use the antibodies described in the present application. Suitable antibodies may be determined using appropriate screening methods, for example by measuring the ability of a particular antibody to passively<br>
[0 protect against streptococcus infection in a test model. One example of an animal model is the mouse model described in the examples herein. The antibody may be a whole antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and may belong to any immunoglobulin class.  The antibody or fragment may be of<br>
1'5 animal origin, specifically of • mammalian origin and more specifically of murine, rat or human origin. It may be a natural antibody or a fragment thereof, or if desired, a recombinant antibody or antibody fragment. The term recombinant antibody or antibody fragment means antibody or<br>
10 antibody fragment which was produced using molecular biology techniques. The antibody or antibody fragments may be polyclonal, or preferably monoclonal. It may be specific for a number of epitopes associated with the streptococcus pneumoniae polypeptides but is preferably specific for one.<br>

20 from the range of 30-37°C to 3 7-42°C results in the induction of the gene under the control of promoter A,PL. The PCR primers used for the generation of the recombinant plasmids had a restriction endonuclease site at the 5'end, thereby allowing directional cloning of the amplified product into the<br>
25  digested plasmid vector. The PCR oligonucleotide primers used are listed in the following Table 1.  The location of the gene sequences coding for BVH-3, BVH-11 and BVH-11-2 gene products is summarized in the Figure 25, Figure 26 and Figure 27, respectively.<br>

Recombinant pSL301 plasmids containing a PCR product were digested with restriction enzymes fox the attention of the DNA inserts. The resulting insert DNA fragments were purified and inserts corresponding to a given chimeric gene were ligated into pET21 vector for the generation of a chimeric gene. The recombinant chimeric polypeptides listed in Table 2 were as C-terminal fusion with an His-tag. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified from supernatant fractions obtained from centrifugation of sonicated IPTG-induced E._ coli cultures using a His-Bind metal chelation resin (QIAgen, Chatsworth, CA).<br>
Groups of 8 female BALB/c mice (Charles River) were immunizied subcutaneously two times at three-week intervals with 25 p.g of either affinity purified His.Tag-fusion protein identifed in presence of 15-20 jig of QuilA adjuvant. Ten to 14 days following the last immunization, the mice were challenged challenged intravenously<br>
with 10E5-10E6 CFU of S. pneumoniae type 3 strain WJ2. The polypeptides and fragments are capable of eliciting a protective immune response.<br>

Hybridomas were tested by ELISA against truncated BVH-3, BVH-<br>
10  3JL or BVH-11-2 gene products in order to characterize the<br>
epitopes recognized by the Mabs.  The truncated gene products<br>
were generated from S- pneumoniae SP64 strain except for BVH-<br>
3-Sp63 which was generated from S. pneumoniae SP63 strain. As<br>
a positive control,  the reactivity of each antibody was<br>
15  examined  with  full-length  BVH-3,  BVH-11  or  BVH-11-2<br>
recombinant proteins. In some cases, the Mab reactivity was<br>
evaluated by Western immunoblotting after separation of the<br>
gene product by SDS-PAGE and transfer on nitrocellulose paper.<br>

The deduced locations of the epitopes are summarized in Figure 28 and Figure 29. As can be seen from the data in Table 3, 5 BVH-3-reactive Mabs can be divided into two groups : BVH-3A-and BVH-3B-reactive Mabs with the exception of Mabs H11-7G11 and H3V-15A10 which reacted with both, BVH-3A and BVH-3B molecules. The BVH-3A-reactive Mabs can be subdivided in two subgroups of antibodies depending of their reactivity or lack<br>
10 of reactivity with BVH-3C recombinant protein. Mab reactive with BVH-3C protein recognized epitopes shared by both, BVH-3 and BVH-11 proteins. As can be seen in Table 4, these BVH-3-and BVH-11-cross-reactive Mabs were also reactive with BVH-11A and BVH-11-2M recombinant proteins. BVH-3B-reactive Mabs can<br>
15 be subdivided into three subgroups according to their reactivity with NEW1, NEW2 and NEW3 recombinant proteins. Some Mabs were only reactive with the NEW1 protein while other Mabs were reactive with either, NBW1 and NEW2 or NEW1 and NEW3 recombinant proteins.<br>
20<br>
Mabs H11-7G11 and H3V-15A10 react with epitopes in more than one position on BVH-3. The reactivity of H11-7G11 with BVH-3AD, BVH-3B, BVH-3C, BVH-11A and BVH-11-2M molecules suggests that H11-7G11 epitope might comprised HXXHXH sequence.  This<br>
25 sequence is repeated, respectively, 6 and 5 times in BVH-3 and BVH-ll/BVH-11-2 protein sequences. The lack of reactivity of Mab H11-7G11 with NEW 10 molecule suggests that the epitope includes the HGDHXH sequence. Multiple-position mapping of H3V-15A10 epitope on BVH-3 is suggested by the reactivity of<br>
30  the Mab with two BVH-3 fragments that do not overlap.<br>
Interestingly, Mabs H3-7G2, H3V-9C6 and H3V-16A7 were not reactive with BVH-3 Sp63 thus allowing the location of their corresponding epitopes on a 177-amino acid fragment comprised 35 between amino acids 244 and 420 on BVH-3 molecule of S. pneumoniae SP64 (Figure 31).<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
As can be seen from the data in Table 4, the Mabs that are reactive with BVH-11- and/or BVH-11-2 and that do not recognize BVH-3 molecules can be divided into three groups 5 according to their reactivities with BVH-11A and NEW10 recombinant proteins. Some Mabs reacted exclusively with either BVH-11A or NEW10 protein while other Mabs were reactive with both, BVH-11A and NEW10 recombinant proteins.<br>
10  EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example describes the construction of BVH-3 and BVH-11-2 gene libraries for the mapping of epitopes.<br>
15 BVH-3 and BVH-11-2 gene libraries were constructed using recombinant pCMV-GH and PSL301 plasmid DNA containing respectively, BVH-3 gene sequence spanning nucleotides 1837 to 4909 (SEQ ID NO: 2) or BVH-11-2 gene sequence spanning nucleotides 172 to 2630 (SEQ ID NO: 5) and the Novatope®<br>
20 library construction and screening system (Novagen) . The recombinant plasmids containing BVH-3 or BVH-11-2 gene fragment were purified Using QIAgen kit (Chatsworth, CA) and digested with the restriction enzymes Bglll and Xbal respectively.   The resulting Bglll-Xbal DNA fragments were<br>
25 purified using the QlAquick gel extraction kit from QIAgen and digested with Dnase I for the generation of randomly cleaved DNA. DNA fragments of 50 to 200 bp were purified, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to blunt the target DNA ends and add a single  3'dA  residue,  and  ligated  into  pSCREEN-T-Vector<br>
30 (Novagen) following the procedures suggested by the manufacturer (Novatope® System, Novagen). The gene libraries of E^ coli clones, each of which expressing a small peptide derived from BVH-3 or BVH-11-2 genes were screened by standard colony lift methods using Mabs as immunoprobes. The colony<br>
35 screening was not successful with Mabs producing very high backgrounds on colony lifts.  Moreover, in some cases, Mabs<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
failed to detect epitope-expressing-colonies. The lack of reactivity can possibly be explained by the small amount of recombinant proteins produced or the recognition of conformation-dependent epitopes consisting of different 5 protein domains. Sequencing of DNA inserts from positive clones determined the location of the segment that encodes the target epitope. The data are presented in Table 5. The peptides encoded by DNA inserts into the recombinant pSCREEN-T vector can be purified and used as immunogens as described 10  below in Example 6.<br>
The peptide sequences obtained from the screening of BVH-3 and BVH-11-2 gene libraries with the Mabs are in agreement with the  Mab  ELISA  reactivities  against  the  truncated  gene<br>
15 products. As expected, the amino acid sequences obtained from H11-7G11 contained the sequence HGDHXH. These findings provide additional evidence for the location of epitopes recognized with the Mabs. Interestingly, although the Mabs H112-10G9, H112-10A2 and H11B-11B8 were reactive against the<br>
20 same peptide, sequence (amino acid residues 594 to 679 on BVH-11-2 protein sequence) , clones corresponding to the sequence spanning from amino acid residues 658 to 698 were only picked up by Mab H11B-11B8 thus revealing the location of H11B-11B8 epitope between amino acid residues 658 to 679 (SEQ ID NO:<br>
25 163). Mabs H112-10G9, H112-10A2, and H11B-11B8 are directed against 3 distinct non overlapping epitopes located closely on the peptide sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 594 to 679 (SEQ ID NO: 22).<br>

EXAMPLE     4<br>
This example describes the  immunization of  animals with recombinant proteins for the generation of antibody reactive 5  with BVH-3, BVH-11 and/or BVH-11-2.<br>
NZW rabbits (Charles River Laboratories, St-Constant, Quebec, Canada) were immunized subcutaneously at multiple sites with 50 \iq    or 100 £ig of the purified BVH-3M, L-BVH-3AD, NEW1,<br>
10 NEW13, or L-BVH-11 recombinant protein in presence of 80 /ig of QuilA adjuvant (Cedarlane Laboratoratories Ltd, Hornby, Canada). The rabbits were boosted two times at three-week intervals with the same antigen and blood samples were collected before each immunization and 6 to 28 days following<br>
15 the last immunization. The sera samples were designated preimmune, post lBt, post 2nd or post 3rd injection. The rabbit immune response to immunization was evaluated by ELISA using recombinant  BVH-3M  (BVH-3M-His»Tag  fusion  protein/  pET21<br>
system)  or BVH-11M  (BVH-llM-His»Tag fusion protein/ pET21<br>
20 system) proteins or suspensions of heat-killed • S^_ pneumoniae Rx-1 cells as coating antigens. ELISA titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest sera dilution at which absorbance A4io value was 0.1 above the background value. Antibodies reactive with BVH-3 and/or BVH-11 epitopes were<br>
25 elicited following immunization in all animals as shown in the following Table 6. Antibody reactive with recombinant or pneumococcal antigens was not present in the preimmune sera. The immune response to immunization was detectable in the sera of each rabbit after a single injection of recombinant<br>
30 antigen. The antibody response following the second injection with either antigen tested was characterized by a strong increase in antibody titer. Interestingly, good titers of antibody reactive with S^ pneumoniae cells, with an average titer of 52,000 after the third immunization, were obtained,<br>
35 thus establishing that native pneumococcal epitopes are expressed on the recombinant E_;_ coli gene products.  These<br>

EXAMPLE 5 5<br>
This example describes the protection of animals against fatal experimental pneumococcal infection by administration of antibody raised to BVH-3, BVH-11 or BVH-11-2 gene products.<br>
10 High-titer Mab preparations were obtained from ascites fluid of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with Mab-secreting hybridoma cells according to the method described by Brodeur et al (J Immunol Methods 71 :265-272, 1984) • Sera samples were collected from rabbits immunized with BVH-3M as described<br>
15 in Example 4. The. rabbit sera collected after the third immunization and ascites fluid were used for the purification of antibodies by precipitation using • 45 to 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The antibody preparations were dissolved and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).<br>
20<br>
CBA/N (x'id). mice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MA) were injected intraperitoneally with either 0.1 ml of purified rabbit  antibodies  or  0.2  ml  of  ascites  fluid  before intravenous challenge with approximately 200 CFU of the type 3<br>
25 S^ pneumoniae strain WU2. Control mice received sterile PBS or antibodies purified from preimmune rabbit sera or sera from rabbits immunized with an unrelated N._ meningitidis recombinant protein antigen. One group of mice was challenged with S^ pneumoniae before the administration of anti-BVH-3<br>
30 antibody. Samples of the S. pneumoniae challenge inoculum were plated on chocolate agar plates to determine the number of CFU and verify the challenge dose. The CBA/N mice were chosen because of their high susceptibility to S_;_ pneumoniae<br><br><br>

infection. The LD50 of WU2 injected intravenously to CBA/N mice is estimated to be S1Q CFU. Deaths were recorded at 24-h intervals for a period of. at least 7 days.<br>
5 The protection data obtained from mice injected with rabbit anti-BVH-3 antibody are set forth in the following Table 7. Nine' out of 10 mice receiving the anti-BVH-3 antibody survived the challenge in contrast to none of 10 mice injected with control antibody or PBS buffer. The observation that antibody 10 raised to the BVH-3-M molecule passively protected even when administered after the challenge demonstrated the ability of anti-BVH-3 antibody to prevent death even from an already established infection.<br>

CBA/N mice were infected with 1000 CFU of WU2 S. pneumoniae before or after intraperitoneal administration of 0.1 ml of rabbit antibody. 20<br>
In an other experiment, 0.1 ml of rabbit antibody prepared from preimmune and immune sera were administered intraperitoneally to CBA/N mice four hours before intranasal challenge with 280 CFU of S^ pneumoniae P4241 type 3 strain. 25  As seen in the following Table 8, all immunized mice survived<br><br><br>

the challenge while none of 9 mice receiving preimmune sera antibody or buffer alone were alive on day 6 post-infection. S. pneumoniae hemocultures on day 11 post-challenge were negative for all surviving mice. Furthermore, 100% protection 5 was observed in mice receiving monoclonal antibodies H112-10G9 or a mixture of H112-10G9 and H11B-7E11 which are' directed against. BVH-ll/BVH-11-2.<br>

Altogether, the results from' Table 7 and Table 8 clearly establish that immunization of animals with a BVH-3 gene product such as BVH-3M elicited protective antibodies capable of  preventing  experimental  ' bacteremia  and  pneumonia<br>
20  infections.<br>
The protection data obtained for mice injected with ascites fluid are set forth in the following Table 9. Administration of a volume of 0.2 ml of ascites fluid of 0.2 ml of some sets 25 of ascites fluid prevented death from experimental infection. For example, H112-3A4 + H112-10G9 and H112-10G2 + H112-10D7<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
sets of 2 Mabs conferred complete protection against experimental infection. These data indicated that antibody targetting BVH-11 and/or BVH-11-2 epitopes gave efficient protection. The Mabs H112-3A4, H112-10G9, H112-10D7, H112-5 10A2, H112-3E8, H112-10C5, H11B-11B8, H11B-15G2, H11B-1C9, H11B-7E11, H11B-13D5 and H11-10B8 were present in at least one protective pair of Mabs and were said to be protective and reactive against protective epitopes. The locations of protection-conferring  epitopes  on BVH-11-2  molecules  are<br>
10 summarized in Table 10 and Figure 29 . Protective Mabs H112-3A4, H112-10G9, . H112-10D7, H112-10A2, H112-3E8, H112-10C5, H11B-11B8, H11B-15G2, H11B-1C9, H11B-7E11, H11B-13D5 and Hll-10B8 were all reactive with New 10 protein corresponding to amino'acid residues 271 to 838 on the BVH-11-2 molecule.  Six<br>
15 out of these 12 Mabs were directed against epitopes present in the NEW 19 protein and 3 protective Mabs recognized NEW 14. Interestingly, Mab H112-3A4 and H112-10C5 reacted with distinct epitopes exclusive to BVH-11-2 located at the carboxyl end comprised between amino acid residues 769 and<br>
20 837. Also, Mabs H11-7G11, H11-6E7 and H3-4F9 reactive with epitopes shared by pneumococcal BVH-3, BVH-11 and BVH-11-2 molecules did not succeed to protect even if given in combination with protective H112-10G9 or H112-11B8 Mab. These Mabs recognized epitopes located at the amino end of the BVH-<br>
25 3, BVH-11 and BVH-11-2 molecules comprising, respectively, the first 225, 228 and 226 amino acid residues. The comparison of the BVH-3, BVH-11 and BVH-11-2 protein sequences revealed that a large number of amino acids were conserved in the amino end portion comprising these 225-228 residues  with<br>
30  a-global 72.8 % identity (Figure 32).<br>
Altogether the data set forth in Table 9 and Table 10 suggest that the protection eliciting BVH-11- and BVH-ll-2-epitopes is comprised in the carboxy terminal product containing amino 35 acids 229 to 840 and 227 to 838, on BVH-11 and BVH-11-2 proteins, respectively.<br><br><br>

This example describes the localization of surface-exposed peptide domains using Mabs described in Example 1.<br>
8. pneumoniae type 3 strain WU2 was grown in Todd Hewitt (TH) 5 broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit MI) enriched with 0.5% Yeast extract (Difco Laboratories) at 37°C in a 8% C02 atmosphere to give an OD60o of 0.260 (-108 CFU/ml) . The bacterial suspension was then aliquoted in 1 ml samples and the S_;_ pneumoniae cells.were pelletted by centrifugation and<br>
10  resuspended in hybridoma culture supernatants. The bacterial<br>
suspensions were then incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Samples were<br>
washed twice in blocking buffer [PBS containing 2% bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA) ] , and then 1 ml of goat fluorescein<br>
(FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG + IgM diluted in, blocking<br>
15 buffer was added. After, an additional incubation of 60 min at room temperature, samples were washed twice in blocking buffer and fixed with 0.25 % formaldehyde in PBS buffer for 18-24 h at 4°C. Cells were washed once in PBS buffer and resuspended in 500 fil   of PBS buffer. Cells were kept in the dark at 4°C<br>
20 until analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics® XL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Ten thousands (10,000) cells were analyzed per sample and the results were expressed as % Fluorescence and Fluorescence index (FI) values. The % Fluorescence is the number of fluorescein-labelled S_;_ pneumoniae cells divided by<br>
25  100 and the FI value is the median fluorescence value of pneumococci treated with Mab supernatant divided by the fluorescence value of pneumococci treated with the conjugate, alone or with a control unrelated Mab. ■  A FI value of 1 indicated that the Mab has not been detected at the surface of<br>
30 the bacteria whereas a FI value higher than 2 was considered positive when at least 10 % of the pneumococcal cells were labelled and indicated that the Mab was ' reactive with cell-surface exposed epitopes. The following Table 11 summarized the data obtained with the Mabs tested by flow cytometry.<br>
35<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00908<br><br>
Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the Mabs reactive with BVH-3C and/or BVH-11A molecules did not bind to the cell surface. In contrast, with the exception of Mabs H3V-9C6 and H3V-16A7, the Mabs reactive with NEW 1, NEW 2, NEW 3, NEW 22 or NEW 23 BVH-3 gene products were detected at the surface of pneumococci. These data indicated that the first 225 amino acid residues located at the amino end of BVH-3 are internal. The lack of binding of Mabs H3V-9C6 and H3V-16A7 suggest some portions of the sequence corresponding to the 177-amino acids absent from the BVH-3 molecule of S^ pneumoniae SP63 appears not to be accessible to antibodies.<br>
Results from BVH-ll- and/or BVH-11-2-reactive Mabs revealed that there is a good correlation between surface-exposure and protection. All Mabs reactive with internal epitopes as determined by the flow cytometry assay were not protective whereas all the protective Mabs described in Example 5 gave a positive signal in flow cytometry. Although an FI value of 9.0 and a % Fluorescence of 81.2 were obtained with Mab Hll-7G11, this Mab was not shown to protect. Additional assays can be used to further evaluate whether this Mab and its corresponding epitope might participate in anti-infectious immunity.<br>

5  This example  describes the immunization of animals ' with peptide epitopes of BVH-3 and BVH-11-2.<br>
The recombinant pSCREEN-T vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing DNA fragment (nucleotides 2421 to 2626 on SEQ ID<br>
10  NO :. 5). encoding the Mab 3A4-epitope (SEQ ID NO: 24) was<br>
transformed by electrbporation (Gene Pulser II apparatus, BIO-<br>
. RAD Labs, Mississauga, Canada) into E^ coli Tuner (A.DE3) pLysS<br>
[BL21  (F' ompT hsdSB  (rB"mB_)  gal dem lacYI pLysS  (Cmr)]<br>
(Novagen) .   In this strain, the expression of the fusion<br>
15 protein is controlled by the T7 promoter which is recognized by the T7 RNA polymerase (present on the XDE3 prophage, itself under the control of the lac promoter inducible by isopropyl-P-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The pLysS plasmid reduces the basal fusion protein expression level by coding for a T7<br>
20 lysozyme, which is a natural inhibitor of the T7 RNA polymerase.<br>
The transformants were grown at 37°C with 250 RPM agitation- in LB broth (peptone lOg/1, yeast extract 5g/l, NaCl 5g/l) 25 supplemented with 50mM glucose, I00jig/ml carbenicillin and 34/zg/ml chloramphenicol, until the absorbance at 600nm reached a value of 0,7. The overexpression of T7gene 10 protein-His»Tag-3A4.1 fusion protein was then induced by the addition of IPTG   to a final concentration of lmM • and further<br><br><br>

incubation at 25°C with 250 RPM agitation for 3 hours. Induced cells from a 800-ml culture were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at -70°C. The fusion protein was purified from the soluble cell fraction by affinity chromatography based on the 5 binding of a six histidine residues sequence (His-Tag) to divalent cations (Ni2+) immobilized on a metal chelation Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada). Briefly, the pelleted cells were thawed and resuspended in Tris buffered sucrose solution (50mM Tris, 25%(w/v) sucrose) and frozen at -<br>
10  70°C for 15 minutes. Cells were incubated 15 minutes on ice in<br>
the  presence  of  2mg/ml  lysozyme  before  disruption  by<br>
sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 12000 RPM for 30<br>
• minutes and Nickel charged Ni-NTA resin (QIAgen) was added to<br>
the supernatant for an overnight incubation at 4°C, with 100<br>
15 RPM agitation. After washing the resin with a buffer consisting of 20mM Tris, 500mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole pH 7,9, the fusion 3A4.1 protein was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 250mM imidazole.  The removal of the salt<br>
and imidazole was done by dialysis against PBS at 4°C. The 20  protein concentration was determined with BCA protein assay reagent kit (Perce, Rockford,IL) and adjusted to 760 ^g/ml.  .<br>
To evaluate whether immunization with an epitope peptide sequence could confer protection against disease, groups of 6<br>
25 female CBA/N (xid) mice (National Cancer Institute) are immunized subcutaneously three times at three-week intervals with affinity purified T7genel0 protein-His«Tag-3A4.1 fusion protein or, as control, with QuilA adjuvant alone in PBS. Twelve to fourteen days following the third immunization, the<br>
30 mice are challenged intravenously with S^ pneumoniae WU2 strain or intranasally with P4241 strain. Samples of the S. pneumoniae challenge inoculum are plated on chocolate agar plates to determine the number of CFU and to verify the challenge dose. The challenge dose are approximalety 300 CFU.<br>

WO 01/98334	PCT/CA01/00908<br>
14 post-challenge, the surviving mice are sacrificed and blood samples tested for the presence of S^ pneumoniae organisms. The 3A4.1 protein or other tested protein is said protective when the number of mice surviving the infection or the median 5 number of days to death is significantly greater in the 3A4.1-immunized group compared to the .control mock-immunized group.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
10 This example illustrates the improvement of the antibody response to pneumococci using BVH-3 fragments and variants thereof.<br>
The combined results obtained from studies of Mab reactivity<br>
15 with truncated gene products, epitope-expressing colonies and live intact pneumococci presented in examples 2, 3 and 6, allowed to delineate between surface-exposed and internal epitopes'. The epitopes detected by Mabs that efficiently bound to pneumococci cells mapped to a region comprised<br>
20 between amino acid residues 223 to 1039 of BVH-3 described in SEQ ID NO 6. The existence of protective epitopes in the BVH-3-carboxyl half was confirmed by demonstrating that mice immunized with NEWl molecule were protected from fatal infection with P4241 strain.<br>
25<br>
Gene sequence comparison revealed that in some strains, the region of BVH-3 encoding for amino acids 244 to 420 as described in SEQ ID N06 is absent thus suggesting the lack of utility of this sequence in vaccine to prevent disease caused<br>
30 by such strains (SEQ ID NO: 9 versus SEQ ID NO: 1) . Further BVH-3 fragments or variants thereof were designed in the purpose to develop a universal highly effective vaccine that would target the immune response to ubiquitous surface-exposed protective epitopes.  BVH-3 gene fragments designated NEWl<br>
35  (encoding amino acid residues 4 72 to 103 9 from SEQ ID NO: 6) and NEW40 (encoding amino acid residues 4 08 to 103 9 from SEQ<br><br><br>

ID NO: 6) were amplified from the S^ pneumoniae strain SP64 by PCR using pairs of oligonucleotides engineered •for the amplification of the appropriate gene fragment. Each of the primers had a restriction endonuclease site at the 5'end, 5 thereby.allowing directional in-frame cloning of the amplified product into the digested plasmid vector. pCR-amplified products were, digested with restriction endonucleases and ligated to linearized plasmid pET21 (Novagen) expression vector digested likewise.   Oligonucleotide primers HAMJ489<br>
10  (ccgaattccatatgcaaattgggcaaccgactc,-   Ndel)    and   HAMJ279<br>
(cgccaagcttcgctatgaaatcagataaattc; Hindlll) were used for the<br>
NEW 40 construction.   Clones were first stabilized in E^ coli<br>
DH5a before  introduction  into  E_;_ coli  BL21  (ADE3)  for<br>
expression of the truncated gene products.  Variants from NEW1<br>
15 and NEW40 were generated by mutagenesis using the Quickchange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit ' from Stratagene and the oligonucleotides designed to incorporate the appropriate mutation. The presence of 6 histidine tag residues on the C~ terminus  of  the  recombinant  molecules  simplified  the<br>
20 purification of the proteins by nickel chromatography. The following tables 12 and 13 describe the sequences of the primers used for the mutagenesis experiments and the variant gene products generated, respectively. Mutagenesis experiments using primer sets 39, 40, 46, 47 or 48 resulted in silent<br>
25. changes and were performed in the purpose of improving the expression of the desired gene or gene fragment since it was observed that during the course of expression, BVH-3 gene and fragments . of, shorter secondary translation initiation products were coexpressed.<br><br><br>

Groups of 7 or 8 female BALB/c mice (Charles River) immunized as described earlier in example 1 were used for protection experiments against intranasal challenge with virulent S_;_ 5 pneumoniae P4241 strain. The mice were observed for 10 to 14 days post-infection. Data from Table 15 clearly indicate that the NEW35A molecule was equivalent to the parental NEW1 in term of protection. Interestingly, high survival rates where obtained for NEW40- and NEW56-immunized groups with 7 and 8 10 survivors out of 8 animals, respectively. Similarly, NEW25 comprising amino acid residues 233 to 1039 protected 7 out of 8 animals from lethal infection.<br>

5 cytometry results are expressed as fluorescence index value where the fluorescence index is the median fluorescence value of pneumococci treated with test sera divided by the background fluorescence value of pneumococci treated with the fluorescein conjugate alone, in these flow cytometric assays, 10 all sera were used at a dilution of 1 :50 and the sera from mice immunized with BVH-3C fragment or QuilA adjuvant alone gave a value similar to the background value.<br>
Altogether the protection and pneumococci antibody binding 15  data indicate that vaccination using NEWl or NEW40 molecules and variants thereof, directs the immune response to conserved protective surface-exposed epitopes.<br>

The recombinant plasmids containing each of the four were digested with restriction endonucleases corresponding with the 5' end of each primer pair used for the PCR-amplification.  The fragments were purified from agarose<br>
25 gel like described earlier and were all ligated to linearized plasmid pET2lb ( + ) digested with the restriction enzymes Ndel and Hindlll for the in-frame cloning of .the four different regions of the BVHll-2 gene.

EXAMPLE 10<br>
This example describes the cloning and expression of chimeric genes encoding for a chimeric protein corresponding to the carboxy-terminal region of, BVH-3 or variants thereof in fusion, at either the carboxyl end or the amino end, to NEW43<br>
#<br>
or variants thereof.<br>
The chimeric genes comprising a BVH-3 truncate variant gene and a NEW43 or NEW43 variant gene have been designed following<br><br><br>
WO 01/98334<br><br>
PCT/CAO1/00908<br><br>
the procedure described in example 1. The polypeptides encoded by these chimeric genes are listed in the table 22. Briefly, gene fragments to be included in a chimeric gene were amplified by PCR using pairs of oligonucleotides engineered so 5 that the primers had a restriction endonuclease site at the 5' end, thereby allowing directional in-frame cloning of the amplified product into digested plasmid vectors (Table 23 and Table 24) . PCR-amplified products were digested with restriction endonucleases and ligated to linearized plasmid<br>
10 pSL301 vector. The resultant plasmid construct were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The recombinant pSL301 plasmids containing a PCR product were redigested with the same endonuclease restriction enzyme for the obtention of the DNA inserts. The resulting insert DNA fragments were purified<br>
15 and inserts corresponding to a given chimeric gene were ligated into pURV22-NdeI vector for the generation of a chimeric gene. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified from supernatant fractions obtained from centrifugation of sonicated heat-induced E^_ coli cultures<br>
20  using multiple chromatographic purification steps.<br>
