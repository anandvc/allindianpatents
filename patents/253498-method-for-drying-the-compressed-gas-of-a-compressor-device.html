Method      for     drying      compressed      gas      and      device     used thereby.<br>
The     present     invention     concerns     a     method     for     drying compressed   gas,    in   particular   compressed  gas   coming   from   a 5       compressor   device   with   a   compressor   having   at    least    two pressure  stages  connected  in  series.<br>
It    is    already   known,    in   order    to   dry   compressed   gas, to    make    use    of    a    dryer    having    at    least    two    pressure vessels   which  are   filled  with   a   desiccant   or  drying  agent, 10       which pressure  vessels   work  alternately,   such  that   when  one pressure   vessel   is   in   action   to   dry   the   compressed   gas, the      other      pressure      vessel      is      being      regenerated, whereby,    in   order   to   dry   the    compressed   gas,    this   gas   is first    cooled    in   a    cooler    and    is    then    sent    through    the 15       drying pressure  vessel   and  whereby,    in  order   to   regenerate the     other    pressure    vessel,     at     least    a    part     of     this compressed       gas       is       guided       counterflow       through       the regenerating pressure vessel.<br>
Also,     it    is    already   known    to   use,    at    the    end    of    the 20      regeneration  cycle  of   the   regenerating   pressure   vessel, a    part    of    the    compressed   gas    to   cool    the    regenerated   or almost   regenerated  drying   agent   by   making   this   part   of   the compressed   gas   expand   to   the   atmospheric   pressure    first, whereby   this   expanded   gas,    after   its   passage    through   the 25      regenerating     pressure      vessel,       is     blown     off      in      the<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
2<br>
atmosphere.<br>
An  advantage  of  cooling  the  drying  agent   in  the   regenerating pressure   vessel    at    the   end   of    the    regeneration    cycle    is 5       that,     at    the    time    the    pressure    vessels     switch     over, whereby    the    regenerated   pressure    vessel    becomes    drying pressure   vessel   and  vice  versa,       temperature   and   dew  point peaks  of   the  compressed gas  are  avoided.<br>
A   disadvantage   of    this   known   method,    however,     is    that 10       relatively   large    amounts    of    compressed    air    are    lost    in the    atmosphere   and    that   blowing   off    already   compressed air    to    an    atmospheric    pressure    entails     large     energy losses,    which   may   lead    to   considerable    extra    costs in     the     case     of     a     compressor    device     with     a     large 15       capacity.<br>
Also, the invention aims to remedy the above-mentioned and other disadvantages by providing a method which makes it possible to cool the drying agent in the regenerating pressure vessel in a more economical manner and with less 20       losses   at   the   end  of   the   regeneration phase.<br>
To   this   end,   the  invention  concerns   a  method   for  drying   the compressed   gas    of    a    compressor   device    with    a    compressor having   at    least    two   pressure   stages   connected   in   series, whereby  a   dryer   is   used  with   at   least   two  pressure   vessels 25      which   are   filled   with   a   desiccant   or   drying   agent,    which pressure    vessels    work    alternately,     such    that    when    one pressure   vessel    is   in   action   to   dry   the   compressed    gas, the       other      pressure      vessel       is      being      regenerated,<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
3<br>
whereby, in order to dry the compressed gas, this gas is cooled first in a cooler and is then sent through the drying pressure vessel and whereby, in order to regenerate the other pressure vessel, at least a part of this compressed 5  gas is guided through the regenerating pressure vessel, and whereby, at least at the end of the regeneration cycle of the  regenerating  pressure  vessel,  this  part  of  the compressed gas, after its passage through the regenerating pressure vessel, is guided to the pressure pipe between 10  two pressure stages.<br>
In this manner, the part of the compressed gas which is used for cooling the drying agent in the regenerating pressure vessel is brought in again between two pressure stages of the compressor, such that there are no losses of 15  compressed air.<br>
Moreover, there is no expansion at an atmospheric pressure, but at a higher pressure prevailing between a high and a low pressure stage of the compressor, such that less compression energy is lost.<br>
20 In practice, it is found that the energy required to cool the drying agent in the regenerating pressure vessel can be reduced to one third when compared to the known method.<br>
The above-mentioned part of the compressed gas which is used to cool the drying agent in the regenerating pressure 25 vessel is preferably expanded first so as to further cool and dry the drying agent when passing through the regenerating pressure vessel.<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
4<br>
The  invention  also  concerns  a  device  which  makes  it possible to apply the above-described method for drying compressed  gas  of  a  compressor  having  at  least  two 5  pressure stages connected in series, which device mainly comprises at least two pressure vessels which are filled with desiccant or drying agent,  whereby these pressure vessels work alternately,  such that  when  one  pressure vessel is in action to dry the compressed gas, the other 10  pressure vessel is being regenerated; a cooler to cool the compressed gas; and pipes with stop cocks which connect the compressor to the above-mentioned pressure vessels, whereby additional pipes and stop cocks are provided which make it possible for at least a part of the compressed 15  gas  of  the  compressor,  after its passage  through the cooler and pressure vessel in the drying stage,  to be guided to the pressure pipe between two pressure stages via the regenerating pressure vessel.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics  of  the 20  invention, the following preferred embodiment is described as an example only without being limitative in any way, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
figure 1 represents a compressor device provided with a device according to the invention for 25         drying the compressed gas;<br>
figures 2 and 3 represent the device of figure 1, but at other stages of the drying process.<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
5<br>
Figure 1 represents a compressor device 1 which mainly consists of a compressor 2 and a drying device 3 according  to  the   invention.<br>
The compressor 2 mainly comprises a low pressure stage 4 5 and a high pressure stage 5 which are connected in series by means of a pressure pipe 6 in which are successively implemented an intercooler 7 and a water separator  5.<br>
The    drying    device    3    comprises    a    first    isolated    pressure 10      vessel    9   with   an    inlet    10    and   an   outlet    11    containing silica   gel    or    any   other   drying   agent;    a    second    isolated pressure    vessel    12    with    an    inlet    13    and    an    outlet     14 which    also    contains    silica    gel     as    a     drying    agent;     a cooler   15;    and   pipes   16   with   stop   cocks    17   and   valves    18 15       which   make   it   possible   to  connect   the   compressor   2   to   the pressure  vessels   9   and   12   to   dry   the   compressed  gas   and   to regenerate   the   drying   agent   in   the   pressure   vessels   and   to make  a  connection  to  the  consumption  network  19.<br>
Additional pipes 20, 21 respectively and stop cocks 22 are 20 provided which allow at least a part of the hot compressed gas of the compressor 2 to be guided to the pressure pipe 6 via one of the pressure vessels 9 or 12 between the two pressure  stages  4   and  5.<br>
The     pipe     20     is     formed     of     a     bridge     which   can     be<br>
25      blocked    between     the     outlets     11     and     14     of	the     two<br>
pressure    vessels    9    and    12,    and    it    comprises    a	pressure<br>
relief valve  23.<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
6<br>
The pipe 21 connects each of the inlets 10 and 13 of the pressure vessels 9 and 12 to the pressure pipe 6, more particularly to the part of the pressure pipe 6 at the inlet of the intercooler 7, and it comprises a filter 24 5  and a valve 25 respectively.<br>
The pipe 21 can be connected to the atmosphere via a tap 26 in which is included a valve 27, and in which a sound absorber can be optionally provided,  to bring back  the pressure  in the regenerating pressure vessel  9  to  the 10  pressure  in the pressure pipe 6 between two pressure stages 4,5, and in which is optionally provided a sound absorber 28 as well.<br>
The working of the compressor device 1 and of the dryer 3 is simple and is illustrated by means of figures 1 to 3, 15  whereby the stop cocks 17 and 22 are represented in black in their closed position,  and in white  in their open position, and whereby the path of the compressed gas is represented in bolt.<br>
During a first phase, as represented in figure 1,  the 20  entire non-cooled compressed gas flow of the compressor 2, more particularly of the high pressure stage 5, is guided counterflow through the pressure vessel 9,  where this gas flow will regenerate the drying agent or desiccant material, for example silica gel, making use of the heat 25  contained in the compressed gas .<br>
Next, the compressed gas flow goes to the cooler where it is cooled further, to be then carried through the pressure<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
7<br>
vessel 12 so as to dry the compressed gas.<br>
The outlet 14 of the pressure vessel 12 is connected to the consumption network 19 at that time,  onto which one or 5  several non-represented consumers of compressed air are connected.<br>
During a second phase, at the end of the regeneration cycle of the drying agent  in the regenerating pressure vessel 9, according to the invention and as represented in 10   figure  2,  the  entire  output  of  compressed  gas  is successively  guided  through  the  cooler  15  and  the pressure vessel 12 to be further dried, after which a part of the cooled gas is supplied to the consumption network 19; the remaining part is guided counterflow through the 15   pressure vessel 9 via the pipes 20 in order to cool the drying agent in the pressure vessel 9, and it is further diverted via the pipe 21 and the filter 24 to the pressure pipe 6 with the intercooler 1.<br>
Before the valve 25 is opened for the cooling, the 20 pressure vessel 9, which needs to be cooled and which is situated at the end pressure, is relieved via valve 27 and sound absorber 28 to a pressure which corresponds to the intercooler 7, in order to prevent a pressure impulse being created towards the intercooler 7.<br>
25 The part of the gas output which flows through the regenerating pressure vessel 9 to cool the drying agent is relieved at the pressure relief valve 23, which may result in an additional cooling.<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
8<br>
This part of the gas output opens into the inlet of the intercooler 7 and is subsequently compressed again by the high pressure stage 5.  Thus, no compressed gas will get lost and the energy required to compress the gas, up to the 5  level  of  the  intercooler  pressure,  which  amounts  for example to 3 bar, is recovered.<br>
The pressure relief valve 23 is preferably selected such or is set such that the expanse of the gas from the nominal end pressure at the outlet of the compressor 2, 10 which end pressure is for example 8 bar, to the intercooler pressure of for example 3 bar, mainly occurs at the pressure relief valve 23.<br>
The part of the gas output which flows through the regenerating pressure vessel 9 before the drying agent is is  cooled, is preferably a fraction of the total gas output which is compressed by the compressor 2,  whereby this fraction is preferably in the order of magnitude of 6% of the total compressor output.<br>
As is represented in figure 3,  in a third and final 20  phase,   immediately  before  the  pressure  vessels  are switched,  whereby the  regenerating pressure vessel  9 becomes the drying pressure vessel and vice versa, the wet compressed gas is distributed for a short time span via the cooler 15 over both pressure vessels 9 and 12. The 25  regenerated pressure vessel 9 is hereby cooled somewhat further and the almost saturated pressure vessel 12 is relieved somewhat.<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
9<br>
The result of the second and third phase is a minimal dew point peak and temperature peak at the time of the above-mentioned switching of the pressure vessels 9 and 12.<br>
If necessary, the drying device 2 may be completed with 5   heating elements 29 which are built-in in the pressure vessels 9 and 12 and which can be activated to promote and optimize the drying process.<br>
It is clear that, for the above-mentioned second phase of the drying process, the part of the compressed gas which is 10   used to cool the regenerated or almost regenerated drying agent, must not be necessarily tapped off at the outlet 14 behind the drying pressure vessel 12, although this is preferred.<br>
It is also clear that the compressor 2 may comprise more<br>
is   than two pressure stages 4-5 and that an intercooler 7 is<br>
not imperative,  whereby the gas which is used for the<br>
cooling of the regenerated drying agent may be guided<br>
between two successive pressure stages as desired.<br>
It also clear that instead of silica gel as a drying agent, 20  also other desiccants are suitable.<br>
The device 1 and the compressor 2 may possibly be provided with measuring appliances to measure the pressure PI, the temperature TT, the dew point TS and the output, as well as with a non-represented controller to control the cycle 25 of the device 1 and the energy consumption as a function of  the required quality of the dry air at the outlet,<br><br>
WO 2006/050582	PCT/BE2005/000149<br>
10<br>
whereby the stop cocks 17 and 22 are controlled stop cocks in this case which can be controlled by the above-mentioned controller.<br>
Also  the  pressure  relief  valve  23  may  be  set  and 5   controlled, if need be, by the above-mentioned controller to make the above-mentioned second and third phase of the drying process pass off optimally.<br>
The  invention can also be  applied to  other  types  of desiccant dryers, for example to rotating desiccant 10  dryers whereby the pressure vessels are made so to say as separate  compartments  of  one  and  the  same  dryer  and whereby  a  common  drying  agent  is  used  for  these compartments which is erected in a rotating manner and which extends partly in each of both compartments,  such 15  that the part of the drying agent in one compartment is used to dry the compressed gas, whereas the part of the drying agent in the other compartment is regenerated.<br>
The  invention can also be applied in combination with different types of compressors, with oil-free; as well as 20  oil-injected compressors.<br>
It is clear that the present invention is not restricted to the above-described method and the device applied thereby, but that it can be applied in all sorts of shapes and combinations while still remaining within the scope of 25  the present invention.<br><br>
