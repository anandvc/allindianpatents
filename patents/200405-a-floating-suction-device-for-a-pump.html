				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
This invention relates to suction equipment for pumps(pumping systems) and more particularly to floating suction equipment for pumps and pumping systems. This invention also relates to pumps(or pumping systems) comprising the floating suction equipment of the invention.<br>
In a pumping system, a down line(downpipe) extends from the suction port to the source of the liquid required to be pumped. Said down line may comprise one or more pipe sections, pipe fittings and other conqjonents, such as valves, bends, instrumentation and others suitably joined/assembled together to form a connection/conduit between said soiu^ce and pump.<br>
Said pipe sections, pipe fittings and other components making up the downpipe may be of metallic, non-metallic or composite construction and may be rigid or flexible. Said source may comprise any body of water such as a well, borewell, tubewell, tank, reservoir, lake, stream, river and others.<br>
The outward end of a said downpipe is referred to in this specification as the suction equipment. It is through said suction equipment that the liquid to be pumped enters the pumping system. Said suction equipment is in contact with the water body being partly or fiilly immersed therein during operation.<br>
In a simple pumping system, said downpipe merely comprises a pipe extending into the water and in this case the outer end of said pipe constitutes the said suction equipment of the system. Said outer end(outer segment) may be integral with the remainder of said pipe or attached thereto by any of the known means. Altematively, said outer segment may be joined to said remainder by a length of flexible hose, pipe or tube.<br><br>
In practice, however, suction equipment may, and generally do, additionally comprise one or more components such as filters and/or strainers, devices to ensure uni-directional flow such as foot valves, check valves, non-retum valves and others. Thus, the floating suction equipment of the invention may also additionally and optionally comprise one or more of aforesaid components.<br>
Suction equipment is also referred to in the art by other terms such as intake, foot valve and others. In this section the term 'suction equipment' is uniformly used and is intended to cover said other terms and expressicais used in the art. Similar scope apphes to the term 'floating suction equipment'. In this specification, in some parts the terms 'suction equipment' and 'floating suction equipment' have been shortened to 'suction' and 'floating suction' respectively. This is in the interests of conciseness and convenience.<br>
Water is the liquid that is generally referred to in this specification as the liquid being pumped or expecting to be pumped. This is in the interests of conciseness and clarity and is without limitation to the scope of the invention. In feet, the floating suction of the invention and the pump(pumping system) of the invention are easily and simply adapted for pumping of liquids other than water and even for pumping of slurries.<br>
The floating suction of the invention can be simply and easily adapted for use with centrifugal pumps, reciprocating pumps, turbine(air jet) pumps used in tubewells/borewells and other punq)s. The term 'pump' and 'pumping system' differ in scope somewhat but are used interchangeably in this specification as the floating suction of the invention is equally easily adapted for both. Further, the term 'pumping system' has been shortened to 'system' in some portions of the specification in the interests of conciseness. The term 'pumping system' includes a system<br><br>
comprising multiple pumps. A said system, therefore, may comprise one or more pumps and said pumps may be single-stage or multi-stage or both.<br>
The suction point in a system is the point where the suction takes place, that is, where the water enters said downpipe and is taken to be the centre point of the mouth of said down pipe. In deciding the location of said suction point with respect to a water body the parameters of the system and the water body are taken into account. For example, in the case of wells/borewells, the position of the water table, the amount of water to be periodically extracted and the rate of replenishment(rate of inflow) may be considered.<br>
Systems of prior art operate on the basis of fixed suction points. TTiat is, c»ice said location is decided generally a system continues to be operated on the same suction point location till there is a major change in one or other of the operational parameters such as, for example, dqjletion of the water table.<br>
In view of the fixed nature of said locations, downpipes of prior art systems are generally rigid, that is, made of rigid pipes and fittings. Where flexible pipes/hoses are used it is with the object of making the system portable or to allow pumping fi-om different sources and/or different levels.<br>
In contrast, in the systems of the invention, said centre point does not remain fixed during operation but rises and falls with^e rise and fall of the water level. The floating sucticm of the invention when used in a said system floats «i the water during operation and follows the level as it rises or falls, Thus, a constant spacing between said centre point and the water surfece, that is, a constant relationshio between the former anH lattftr ic maintainaA /!..«««»«,=«♦;««<br><br>
It will therefore be observed, that the floating suction of the invention is ideally suited to applications such as a well, borewell or a tubewell where changes in water level occur or are e5q)ected to occur. In these applications the water table drops during the dry seasons and rises during the rainy periods.<br>
In prior art systems, where such depletion of water table takes place said suction point is lowered by extension of the down pipe. This involves adding pipe segments to the downpipe. Such additions are done in stages in general synchronisation with the falling water table. As the depletions are generally seasonal the table begins to regain the lost height with the arrival of fresh inflows of water. When the table begins to rise, in prior art systems said pipe segments are successively removed in general synchronisation with the rising table. The reason for going in for said successive additions and removals is that water in most wells/borewells is found to be more potable at or near the surface of water than at lower levels. By maintaining said suction point at or near the water surfece during the replenishment season it is possible harvest the freshly inflowed new water before any substantial intermixing of said new water with the lower level brackish water has taken place. Similarly, during the lean seasons, maintaining said location at or near the water face, water is drawn from the upper levels where it is generally more potable than at lower levels.<br>
As mentioned, prior art systems maintain said centre point at or near the water surfece by the process of said additions/removals of pipe segments which process is not only cumbersome but wastefiil of time and money.<br>
This drawback is avoided by using the floating suction of the invention. The floating suction of the invjsrtion floats on the water and therefore follows the changes in the water level, if any and<br><br>
maintains said centre point at or close to the water surfece all the time. ITiis ensures drawal of water constantly from or near the water surface.<br>
Apart from eliminating said drawback, the floating suction of invention offers the following advantages:<br>
i.	drawal of water from or close to the surface;<br>
ii,	very suitable and advantageous for wells, borewells and tubewells that have<br>
brackish water and/or suspended matter as the water in the upper layers is<br>
generally less brackish(more potable) and holds lesser suspended solids than that<br>
at lower levels; iii.        compactly designed floating suction which can even be accomodated in narrow<br>
borewells/tubewells of size as low as 127mm(5" dia); iv.        provision for adjustment of flow area at said suction point; V.        provision of adjustment means for adjustment of spacing between said suction<br>
point and water level; and vi.        adaptibility for use with any water source.<br>
The floating suction of the invention is also particularly relevant where the bottom(floor) of a said source may be changing with time, for example, a river where there is a rise or fell in the riverbed level at the point of suction. Another example is settling tanks where the zone of settled or partly settled solids varies from operation to operation.<br>
Essentially, the floating suction of the invention comprises a buoyancy member and a suction member. Said buoyancy member and suction member are either integral with, or attached to each other. Said buoyancy member provides the required buoyancy to keep the assembly of said two<br><br>
members afloat and also to bear the weight of the flexible means used for connecting said assembly witli the remainder of said down pipe. Said flexible means comprises a flexible pipe/hose/tube and allows for movement of said floating suction with rising and falling water level.<br>
According to tlie invention, therefore, tliere is provided a floating suction device for a pmnp, or a set of pumps, comprising a buoyancy member and a suction member, said buoyancy member having air chamber(s) tliat provides buoyancy to the said suction member and said suction member having opening(s)/port(s) for flow of water (or other liquid) Uiereinto and then through a flexible pipe/hose thereof to the downpipe of said pump/pump set, the device ftirtlier comprising means for varjong the spacing between said buoyancy and suction members and, ftutliemiore, vahe means for regulating said flow.<br>
According to tlie invention, there is also provided pump(s) and pumping installations{s) incorporating said floating suction device of the invention.<br>
Said buoyancy member essentially comprises one or more hollow chambers to provide the desired buoyancy to maintain said floating suction as a whole afloat. Thus, tlie buoyancy effect generated must balance not only the weight of the floating suction but also that of said flexible means in all positions thereof<br><br>
Each said chamber may be a single compartment or multiple compartment type. Said chambers/compartments may comprise control means to flood them partly or fully as required. Said control means allow adjustment of the buoyancy of the floating suction to adapt it for different applications and also to give it the right degree of stability.<br>
The configuration of said chambers/compartments may be hollow cylindrical with or without conical bottoms or other geometrical shapes/designs. Said buoyancy chambers may also be of generally conical configuration or of a stq)ped configuration. The latter is relevant where stability considerations are important. Similarly, within the scope of the invention, said buoyancy members may comprise shapes and structures that specifically provide stability such as fins and others. This would be relevant for adaptation of the floating suction of the invention for certain water sources.<br>
Said buoyancy members may be of generally metallic or non-metallic or composite construction and made by casting, moulding, febrication or other processes.<br>
Said suction member comprises raie or more said openings for the entry of water. Further the suction member comprises one or more passages therethrough to allow the water to flow into said flexible means and fiom there into the further part of the downpipe. In the simplest arrangement, said suction member is a pipe-like member comprising one opening at the top thereof and a single passage to the bottom thereof, the latter being connected to said flexible means. Said suction member may be cast, moulded, fabricated or made by other processes and may be of generally metallic, non-metallic or composite construction. The number and shape of said passages is determined with a view to minimise the flow resistance of the suction member. As mentioned, said suction member may comprise said additional components and fittings such as check/non-<br><br>
return valves for ensuring uni-directional flow and others. The valve means of said suction member, for controlling the flow therethrough may be integral therewith or attached thereto.<br>
As mentioned, said suction member may be integral with said buoyancy member or attached thereto. If attached said attachment means may be rigid or flexible. Alternatively, said suction member may also be suspended from said buoyancy member. Said suction member is required to be connected to the remainder of the said downpipe by flexible means. Thus, the water flows through said suction means and flexible means and through the further parts of the downpipe to the pump. Said flexible means may comprise flexible hose, pipe or tube.<br>
The degree of flexibility and stiffiiess of the connecting hose(said flexible means) and the configuration thereof are iraportsat considerations in selection thereof and said selection may differ from appUcation to application.  This is particularly relevant for borewell/tubewell applications as in this case the flexible hose is required to operate in an extremely narrow space. The hose must not put excessive sideways pressure on said floating suction which may lead to wedging thereof against the sides of the well casing and must also withstand the repeated flexing within the narrow confines of the well casing. The length of the hose is carefially selected to provide the necessary range of movement for the said floating suction, hi short, said flexible means have been selected such as to provide maximum operational reliability.<br>
Within the scope of the invention said suction member may con^rise one or more said openings and one or more said passages.<br>
In the embodiment described hereinbelow, said buoyancy member is of generally cylindrical hollow construction and has a generally conical hollow bottom portion. It is of plastics construction. Said suction member is generally pipe-like in configuration and has a single said<br><br>
opening for water entry at the top thereof and a single water passage leading to said flexible hose connected between said suction member and the said remainder of the downpipe.   The suction member comprises integral valve means for control of the water flow.<br>
Said valve means is located within said pipe-like structure and comprises a disc-shaped member which can be moved towards and away from said opening along the axis of the floating suction. The movement of said disc member in one direction increases the flow area at said opening while the opposite movement decreases the same. Said disc member is mounted on a spindle that is threaded at one end. Operation of said threaded means causes the movement of the disc member. The suction member is of generally brass construction and is rigidly but adjustably attached to said buoyancy member.<br>
The floating suction of the invention is simply and easily adapted for different water sources, in particular, to a well, borewell/tubewell, tank, lake and river. It is similarly easily and simply adapted for use with other applications such as, for example, settling tanks used in ore processing plants and water and sewage treatment plants.  The adaptation of said floating suction to tanks where separation of immiscible Uquids is carried out is also simple and easy and so also to tanks where a plurality of immiscible liquids are being stored.<br>
In selecting the abovementioned materials of construction, namely plastics and brass for the buoyancy member and suction member respectively of the floating suction of the invention, cost, ease of manufacture and corrosion resistance to water were the main considerations   Other materials of construction are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
In order to provide a clearer understanding of the invention and without limitation to the scope of the invention an embodiment thereof will now be described with respect to the accompanying<br><br>
drawing wherein reference numeral 1 denotes said buoyancy member of the floating suction of the invention, which comprises a generally cylindrical hollow portion 2 and a generally conical hollow bottom portion 3. Said suction member 4 comprises said opening 5 for entry of water into said downpipe 6 and a said passage for flow into said flexible means 10. Said suction member 4 also comprises valve means 7 for control of flow of water thereinto. Valve means 7 conqjrise a valve disc member 8 that can be moved forwards and backwards al<aig the axis of suction member movement valve disc is effected by operation threaded means></aig>
The bottom end of surtion member 4 is connected to flexible hose 10 which, in turn, c<mmects to end of pipe down suction member is rigidly attached buoyancy through connection that comprises a threaded part by means which adjustment said water surfece point distance can be carried out. plastics and brass.></mmects>
The length of the flexible hose 10 must be adequate to provide the desired range of movement for the floating suction. The parameters of the hose 10 such as the configuration and flexibility thereof, the degree of buoyancy of member 1, the material and configuration of the buoyancy member 1 have been selected such that they ensure smooth repeated up and down movement of the floating suction and substantially exclude the possibility of wedging of the floating suction against any adjacent surface in the water source. This embodiment is therefore particularly relevant for application of the floating suction of the invention to borewellsAubewells and in fact, comprises the floating suction of the invention installed in a said tubewell.<br>
