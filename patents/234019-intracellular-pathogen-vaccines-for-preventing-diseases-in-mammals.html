Reference to Government<br>
This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. AI31338 awarded by<br>
the Department of Health and Human Services. The Government has certain rights in this<br>
invention.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to immunotherapeutic agents and vaccines against<br>
intracellular pathogenic organisms such as bacteria, protozoa, viruses and fungi. More<br>
specifically, unlike prior art vaccines and immunotherapeutic agents based upon pathogenic<br>
subunits, killed pathogens and attenuated natural pathogens, the present invention uses<br>
recombinant attenuated pathogens, or closely related species, that express and secrete<br>
immunogenic determinants of a selected pathogen stimulating an effective immune response in<br>
mammalian hosts. The immunostimulatory vaccines and immunotherapeutics of the present<br>
invention are derived from recombinant attenuated intracellular pathogens, or closely related<br>
species, that express immunogenic determinants in silv.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It has long been recognized that parasitic microorganisms possess the ability to infect<br>
animals thereby causing disease and often the death of the host. Pathogenic agents have been a<br>
leading cause of death throughout history and continue to inflict immense suffering. Though the<br>
last hundred years have seen dramatic advances in the prevention and treatment of many<br>
infectious diseases, complicated host-parasite interactions still limit the universal effectiveness of<br>
therapeutic measures. Difficulties in countering the sophisticated invasive mechanisms displayed<br>
by many pathogenic organisms is evidenced by the resurgence of various diseases such as<br>
tuberculosis, as well as the appearance of numerous drug resistant strains of bacteria and viruses.<br>
Among those pathogenic agents of major epidemiological concern, intracellular bacteria<br>
have proven to be particularly intractable in the face of therapeutic or prophylactic measures.<br>
Intracellular bacteria, including the genus Mycobacterium and the genus Legionella, complete all<br>
or part of their lifecycle within the cells of the infected host organism rather than extraceilularly.<br>
Around the world, intracellular bacteria are responsible for millions of deaths each year and untold<br>
suffering. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from a single disease agent worldwide, with<br>
10 million new cases and 2.9 million deaths every year. In addition, intracellular bacteria are<br>
responsible for millions of cases of leprosy. Other debilitating diseases transmitted by intracellular<br>
agents include cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease),<br>
listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, trachoma, psittacosis, Q-fever, and legionellosis. At<br>
this time, relatively little can be done to prevent debilitating infections in susceptible individuals<br>
exposed to many of these organisms Due to this inability to effectively protect populations from<br>
such intracellular pathogens and the resulting human and animal morbidity and mortality caused<br>
by such agents, tuberculosis, is one of the most important diseases now confronting mankind.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the following exemplary discussion of M.<br>
tuberculosis is illustrative of the teachings of the present invention and is in no way intended to<br>
limit the scope of the present invention to the treatment of M. tuberculosis. Similarly, the<br>
teachings herein are not limited in any way to the treatment of tubercular infections. On the<br>
contrary, this invention may be used to advantageously provide safe and effective vaccines and<br>
immunotherapeutic agents against any pathogenic agent by using recombinant attenuated<br>
pathogens, or recombinant avirulent organisms, to express, and of equal importance to release the<br>
immunologically important proteins of the pathogenic organism.<br>
Currently it is believed that approximately one-third of the world's population is infected<br>
by M. tuberculosis resulting in millions of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis annually. More<br>
specifically, human pulmonary tuberculosis primarily caused by M. tuberculosis is a major cause<br>
of death in developing countries. Capable of surviving inside macrophages and monocytes, M.<br>
tuberculosis may produce a chronic intracellular infection. M. tuberculosis is relatively successful<br>
in evading the normal defenses of the host organism by concealing itself within the cells primarily<br>
responsible for the detection of foreign elements and subsequent activation of the immune system.<br>
Moreover, many of the front-line chemotherapeutic agents used to treat tuberculosis have<br>
relatively low activity against intracellular organisms as compared to extracellular forms. These<br>
same pathogenic characteristics have heretofore prevented the development of fully effective<br>
immunotherapeutic agents or vaccines against tubercular infections.<br>
While this disease is a particularly acute health problem in the developing countries of<br>
Latin America, Africa, and Asia, it is also becoming more prevalent in the first world. In the<br>
United States specific populations are at increased risk, especially urban poor,<br>
immunocompromised individuals and immigrants from areas of high disease prevalence. Largely<br>
due to the AIDS epidemic, in recent years the incidence of tuberculosis has increased in developed<br>
countries, often in the form of multi-drug resistant M tuberculosis.<br>
Recently, tuberculosis resistance to one or more drugs was reported in 36 of the 50 United<br>
States. In New York City, one-third of all cases tested was resistant to one or more major drugs.<br>
Though non-resistant tuberculosis can be cured with a long course of antibiotics, the outlook<br>
regarding drug resistant strains is bleak. Patients infected with strains resistant to two or more<br>
major, antibiotics have a fatality rate of around 50%. Accordingly, safe and effective vaccines<br>
against such varieties ofM tuberculosis are sorely needed.<br>
Initial infections of M. tuberculosis almost always occur through the inhalation of<br>
aerosolized particles as the pathogen can remain viable for weeks or months in moist or dry<br>
sputum. Although the primary site of the infection is in the lungs, the organism can also cause<br>
infection of nearly any organ including, but not limited to, the bones, spleen, kidney, meninges<br>
and skin. Depending on the virulence of the particular strain and the resistance of the host, the<br>
infection and corresponding damage to the tissue may be minor or extensive. In the case of<br>
humans, the initial infection is controlled in the majority of individuals exposed to virulent strains<br>
of the bacteria. The development of acquired immunity following the initial challenge reduces<br>
bacterial proliferation thereby allowing lesions to heal and leaving the subject largely<br>
asymptomatic.<br>
When M. tuberculosis is not controlled by the infected subject it often results in the<br>
extensive degradation of lung tissue. In susceptible individuals lesions are usually formed in the<br>
lung as the tubercle bacilli reproduce within alveolar or pulmonary macrophages. As the<br>
organisms multiply, they may spread through the lymphatic system to distal lymph nodes and<br>
through the blood stream to the lung apices, bone marrow, kidney and meninges surrounding the<br>
brain. Primarily as the result of cell-mediated hypersensitivity responses, characteristic<br>
granulomatous lesions or tubercles are produced in proportion to the severity of the infection.<br>
These lesions consist of epithelioid cells bordered by monocytes, lymphocytes and fibroblasts. In<br>
most instances a lesion or tubercle eventually becomes necrotic and undergoes caseation<br>
(conversion of affected tissues into a soft cheesy substance).<br>
While M tuberculosis is a significant pathogen, other species of the genus Mycobacterium<br>
also cause disease in animals including man and are clearly within the scope of the present<br>
invention. For example, M. bovis is closely related to M. tuberculosis and is responsible for<br>
tubercular infections in domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, horses, dogs and cats.<br>
Further, M. bovis may infect humans via the intestinal tract, typically from the ingestion of raw<br>
milk. The localized intestinal infection eventually spreads to the respiratory tract and is followed<br>
shortly by the classic symptoms of tuberculosis. Another important pathogenic vector of the<br>
genus Mycobacterium is M. leprae that causes millions of cases of the ancient disease leprosy.<br>
Other species of this genus which cause disease in animals and man includeM kansasii, M. avium<br>
intracellulare, M. fortuitum, M. marinum, M. chelonei, and M. scrofulaceum. The pathogenic<br>
mycobacterial species frequently exhibit a high degree of homology in their respective DNA and<br>
corresponding protein sequences and some species, such as M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, are<br>
highly related.<br>
For obvious practical and moral reasons, initial work in humans to determine the efficacy<br>
of experimental compositions with regard to such afflictions is infeasible. Accordingly, in the<br>
early development of any drug or vaccine it is standard procedure to employ appropriate animal<br>
models for reasons of safety and expense. The success of implementing laboratory animal models<br>
is predicated on the understanding that immunogenic epitopes are frequently active in different<br>
host species. Thus, an immunogenic determinant in one species, for example a rodent or guinea<br>
pig, will generally be immunoreactive in a different species such as in humans. Only after the<br>
appropriate animal models are sufficiently developed will clinical trials in humans be carried out<br>
to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a vaccine in man.<br>
With regard to alveolar or pulmonary infections by M tuberculosis, the guinea pig model<br>
closely resembles the human pathology of the disease in many respects. Accordingly, it is well<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that it is appropriate to extrapolate the guinea pig model of<br>
this disease to humans and other mammals. As with humans, guinea pigs are susceptible to<br>
tubercular infection with low doses of the aerosolized human pathogen M. tuberculosis. Unlike<br>
humans where the initial infection is usually controlled, guinea pigs consistently develop<br>
disseminated disease upon exposure to the aerosolized pathogen, facilitating subsequent analysis.<br>
Further, both guinea pigs and humans display cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions<br>
characterized by the development of a dense mononuclear cell induration or rigid area at the skin<br>
test site. Finally, the characteristic tubercular lesions of humans and guinea pigs exhibit similar<br>
morphology including the presence of Langhans giant cells. As guinea pigs are more susceptible<br>
to initial infection and progression of the disease than humans, any protection conferred in<br>
experiments using this animal model provides a strong indication that the same protective<br>
immunity may be generated in man or other less susceptible mammals. Accordingly, for purposes<br>
of explanation only and not for purposes of limitation, the present invention will be primarily<br>
demonstrated in the exemplary context of guinea pigs as the mammalian host. Those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate that the present invention may be practiced with other mammalian hosts<br>
including humans and domesticated animals.<br>
Any animal or human infected with a pathogenic organism and, in particular, an<br>
intracellular organism, presents a difficult challenge to the host immune system. While many<br>
infectious agents may be effectively controlled by the humoral response and corresponding<br>
production of protective antibodies, these mechanisms are primarily effective only against those<br>
pathogens located in the body's extracellular fluid. In particular, opsonizing antibodies bind to<br>
extracellular foreign agents thereby rendering them susceptible to phagocytosis and subsequent<br>
intracellular killing. Yet this is not the case for other pathogens. For example, previous studies<br>
have indicated that the humoral immune response does not appear to play a significant protective<br>
role against infections by intracellular bacteria such as M. tuberculosis. However, the present<br>
invention may generate a beneficial humoral response to the target pathogen and, as such, its<br>
effectiveness is not limited to any specific component of the stimulated immune response.<br>
More specifically, antibody mediated defenses seemingly do not prevent the initial<br>
infection of intracellular pathogens and are ineffectual once the bacteria are sequestered within the<br>
cells of the host. As water soluble proteins, antibodies can permeate the extracellular fluid and<br>
blood, but have difficulty migrating across the lipid membranes of cells. Further, the production<br>
of opsonizing antibodies against bacterial surface structures may actually assist intracellular<br>
pathogens in entering the host cell. Accordingly, any effective prophylactic measure against<br>
intracellular agents, such as Mycobacterium, should incorporate an aggressive cell-mediated<br>
immune response component leading to the rapid proliferation of antigen specific lymphocytes<br>
that activate the compromised phagocytes or cytotoxically eliminate them. However, as will be<br>
discussed in detail below, inducing a cell-mediated immune response does not equal the induction<br>
of protective immunity. Though cell-mediated immunity may be a prerequisite to protective<br>
immunity, the production of vaccines in accordance with the teachings of the present invention<br>
requires animal based challenge studies.<br>
This cell-mediated immune response generally involves two steps. The initial step,<br>
signaling that the cell is infected, is accomplished by special molecules (major histocompatibility<br>
or MHC molecules) which deliver pieces of the pathogen to the surface of the cell. These MHC<br>
molecules bind to small fragments of bacterial proteins that have been degraded within the<br>
infected cell and present them at the surface of the cell. Their presentation to T-cells stimulates<br>
the immune system of the host to eliminate the infected host cell or induces the host cell to<br>
eradicate any bacteria residing within.<br>
Attempts to eradicate tuberculosis using vaccination was initiated in 1921 after Calmette<br>
and Guerin successfully attenuated a virulent strain of M. bovis using in vitro serial passage<br>
techniques. The resultant live vaccine developed at the Institut Pasteur in Lille, France is known<br>
as the Bacille Calmette and Guerin, or BCG vaccine. Nearly eighty years later this vaccine<br>
remains the only prophylactic therapy for tuberculosis currently in use. In fact, all BCG vaccines<br>
available today are derived from the original strain of M. bovis developed by Calmette and Guerin<br>
at the Institut Pasteur.<br>
The World Health Organization considers the BCG vaccine an essential factor in reducing<br>
tuberculosis worldwide, especially in developing nations. In theory, BCG vaccine confers cell-<br>
mediated immunity against an attenuated mycobacterium that is immunologically related to M.<br>
tuberculosis. The resulting immune response should prevent primary tuberculosis. Thus, if<br>
primary tuberculosis is prevented, latent infections cannot occur and disease reactivation is<br>
avoided.<br>
However, controlled clinical trials have revealed significant variations in vaccine efficacy.<br>
Reported efficacy rates have varied between 0-80%. Vaccine trials conducted in English school<br>
children reported a ten-year post vaccination protection rate in excess of 78%. However, in a<br>
similar trial in South India, BCG failed to protect against culture-proven primary tuberculosis in<br>
the first 5 years post inoculation. A recent meta-analysis of BCG efficacy in the prevention of<br>
tuberculosis estimated that overall prophylactic efficacy was approximately 50%. (Colditz, G.A.<br>
T.F. Brewer, C.S. Berkey, M.E. Wilson, E. Burdick, H.V. Fineberg, and F. Mosteller. 1994.<br>
JAMA 271.698-702.)<br>
This remarkable disparity in reported efficacy rates remains a vexing problem for health<br>
officials and practitioners that must determine when and how to use the BCG vaccine. Numerous<br>
factors have been implicated that may account for these observed efficacy disparities including<br>
differences in manufacturing techniques, routes of inoculation and characteristics of the<br>
populations and environments in which the vaccines have been used. Recent work suggests that<br>
incidental contact with environmental mycobacteria may result in a "natural vaccine" that<br>
prevents the vaccine recipient from mounting an effective response to native BCG proteins.<br>
In order to minimize BCG immunogenicity variation, vaccine manufactures maintain<br>
master stocks of original vaccine strains in the lyophilized (freeze-dried) state. Each production<br>
strain derived therefrom is in turn named after the manufacturing site, company or bacterial strain,<br>
for example: BCG-London, BCG-Copenhagen, BCG-Connaught, or BCG-Tice (marketed<br>
worldwide by Organon, Inc.). In an effort to standardize manufacturing techniques in the United<br>
States, the Federal Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Biologic Education and<br>
Research (CBER) regulates vaccine manufacturing. The FDA's CBER branch has specified that<br>
each lyophilized BCG strain used for vaccination must be capable of inducing a specified<br>
tuberculin skin test reaction in guinea pigs and humans. Unfortunately, induced tuberculin<br>
sensitivity has not been shown to correlate with protective immunity.<br>
Current BCG vaccines are provided as lyphophilzed cultures that are re-hydrated with<br>
sterile diluent immediately before administration. The BCG vaccine is given at birth, in infancy,<br>
or in early childhood in countries that practice BCG vaccination, including developing and<br>
developed countries. Adult visitors to endemic regions who may have been exposed to high doses<br>
of infectious mycobacteria may receive BCG as a prophylactic providing they are skin test non-<br>
reactiye. Adverse reactions to the vaccine are rare and are generally limited to skin ulcerations<br>
and lymphadenitis near the injection site. However, in spite of these rare adverse reactions, the<br>
BCG vaccine has an unparalleled history of safety with over three billion doses having been<br>
administered Avorldwide since 1930.<br>
Eighty-years have now passed since BCG was developed and there remains paucity in<br>
acceptable vaccine alternatives. Recently, the present inventors have made considerable<br>
progress in the isolation, characterization and recombinant expression of extracellular proteins<br>
secreted by intracellular pathogens. For example, the inventors' U.S. Patent No. 5,108,745,<br>
issued April 28, 1992 and several pending U.S. Patent applications provide vaccines and methods<br>
of producing protective immunity against L. pneumophila and M. tuberculosis as well as other<br>
intracellular pathogens. These prior art vaccines are broadly based on extracellular products<br>
originally derived from proteinaceous compounds released extracellularly by the pathogenic<br>
bacteria into broth culture in vitro and released extracellularly by bacteria within infected host<br>
cells in vivo. As provided therein, these vaccines are selectively based on the identification of<br>
extracellular products or their analogs that stimulate a strong immune response against the target<br>
pathogen in a mammalian host.<br>
Vaccines prepared from selected M. tuberculosis extracellular products are currently being<br>
optimized for use as human prophylactic therapies. Protein cocktails and individual protein<br>
preparations using both recombinant as well as naturally expressed proteins are being studied.<br>
One goal of these ongoing studies is to maximize the base immune response through optimum<br>
immunogen (protein) presentation. To date over 100 different preparations have been made<br>
including 38 different protein combinations, 26 different adjuvants, 10 different protein<br>
concentrations and seven different dosing regimens. The candidate vaccine proteins have also<br>
been coupled to non-M tuberculosis proteins including bovine serum albumin, Legionella sp.<br>
major secretory protein, and tetanus toxoid. This list is not inclusive of methods the present<br>
inventors have used to present extracellular proteins of intracellular pathogens to host animals;<br>
rather it illustrates the enormous complexity and inherent variability associated with vaccine<br>
optimization. However, in spite of these and other activities, no combination of extracellular<br>
proteins, adjuvants, carrier proteins, concentrations or dosing frequencies resulted in inducing a<br>
protective immune response in guinea pigs that was comparable or superior to BCG.<br>
Recently, significant attention has been focused on using transformed BCG strains to<br>
produce vaccines that express various cell-associated antigens. For example, C.K. Stover, et<br>
al. have reported a Lyme Disease vaccine using a recombinant BCG (rBCG) that expresses the<br>
membrane associated lipoprotein OspA of Boirelia burgdorferi. Similarly, the same author<br>
has also produced a rBCG vaccine expressing a pneumococcal surface protein (PsPA) of<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae. (Stover, C.K., G.P. Bansal, S. Langerman, and M.S. Hanson.<br>
1994. Protective Immunity Elicited by rBCG Vaccines. In: Brown F. (ed): Recombinant<br>
Vectors in Vaccine Development. Dev Biol Stand. Dasel, Karger, Vol. 82, 163-170.)<br>
United States patent number (USPN) 5,504,005 (the '"005" patent") and USPN<br>
5,854,055 (the '"055 patent") both issued to B.R. Bloom et al., disclose theoretical rBCG<br>
vectors expressing a wide range of cell associated fusion proteins from numerous species of<br>
microorganisms. The theoretical vectors described in these patents are either directed to cell<br>
associated fusion proteins, as opposed to extracellular non-fusion protein antigens, and/or the<br>
rBCG is hypothetically expressing fusion proteins from distantly related species. Moreover,<br>
the recombinant cell associated fusion proteins expressed in these models are encoded on DNA<br>
that is integrated into the host genome and under the control of heat shock promoters.<br>
Consequently, the antigens expressed are fusion proteins and expression is limited to levels<br>
approximately equal to, or less than, the vector's native proteins.<br>
Furthermore, neither the '005 nor the '055 patent disclose animal model safety testing,<br>
immune response development or protective immunity in an animal system that closely<br>
emulates human disease. In addition, only theoretical rBCG vectors expressing M.<br>
tuberculosis fusion proteins are disclosed in the '005 and '055, no actual vaccines are enabled.<br>
Those vaccine models for M. tuberculosis that are disclosed are directed to cell associated heat<br>
shock fusion proteins, not extracellular non-fusion proteins.<br>
United States patent number 5,830,475 (the '"475 patent") also discloses theoretical<br>
mycobacterial vaccines used to express "fusion proteins. The DNA encoding for these fusion<br>
proteins resides in extrachromasomal plasmids under the control of mycobacterial heat shock<br>
protein and stress protein promoters. The vaccines disclosed are intended to elicit immune<br>
responses in non-human animals for the purpose of producing antibodies thereto and not shown<br>
to prevent intracellular pathogen diseases in mammals. Moreover, the '475 patent does not<br>
disclose recombinant vaccinating agents that use protein specific promoters to express<br>
extracellular non-fusion proteins.<br>
The present inventors propose, without limitation, that major extracellular non-fusion<br>
proteins of intracellular pathogens may be important immunoprotective molecules. First,<br>
extracellular non-fusion proteins, by virtue of their release by the pathogen into the<br>
intracellular milieu of the host cell, are available for processing and presentation to the immune<br>
system as fragments bound to MHC molecules on the host cell surface. These peptide-MHC<br>
complexes serve to alert the immune system to the presence within the host cell of an otherwise<br>
hidden invader, enabling the immune system to mount an appropriate anti-microbial attack<br>
against the invader. Second, effective immunization with extracellular proteins is able to<br>
induce a population of immune cells that recognize the same peptide-MHC complexes at some<br>
future time when the complexes are displayed on host cells invaded by the relevant<br>
intracellular pathogen. The immune cells are thus able to target the infected host cells and<br>
either activate them with cytokines, thereby enabling them to restrict growth of the intracellular<br>
pathogen, or lyse them, thereby denying the pathogen the intracellular milieu in which it<br>
thrives. Third, among the extracellular proteins, the major ones, i.e., those produced most<br>
abundantly, will figure most prominently as immunoprotective molecules since they would<br>
generally provide the richest display of peptide-MHC complexes to the immune system.<br>
Therefore, there remains a need for recombinant intracellular pathogen vaccines that<br>
express major extracellular non-fusion proteins of intracellular pathogens that are closely<br>
related to the vaccinating agent. Furthermore, there is a need for recombinant intracellular<br>
pathogen vaccines that are capable of over-expressing recombinant extracellular non-fusion<br>
proteins by virtue of extrachromosomal DNA having non-heat shock gene promoters or non-<br>
stress protein gene promoters.<br>
Specifically, there remains an urgent need to produce intracellular pathogen vaccines<br>
that provide recipients protection from diseases that is superior to the protection afforded BCG<br>
vaccine recipients. Moreover, there is an urgent need to provide both developed and<br>
developing countries with a cost efficient, immunotherapeutic and prophylactic treatment for<br>
tuberculosis and other intracellular pathogens.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide therapeutic and prophylactic<br>
vaccines for the treatment and prevention of disease caused by intracellular pathogens.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide vaccines for preventing intracellular<br>
pathogen diseases using intracellular pathogens that have been transformed to express the major<br>
recombinant immunogenic antigens of the same intracellular pathogen, another intracellular<br>
pathogen, or both.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide vaccines for the treatment and<br>
prevention of mycobacteria diseases using recombinant BCG that expresses the extracellular<br>
protein(s) of a pathogenic mycobacterium.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide vaccines for treatment and/or<br>
prevention of tuberculosis using recombinant strains of BCGthat express and secrete one or more<br>
major extracellular proteins of'Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention accomplishes the above-described and other objects by providing a<br>
new class of vaccines and immunotherapeutics and methods for treating and preventing<br>
intracellular pathogen diseases in mammals. Historically intracellular pathogen vaccines and<br>
immunotherapeutics have been prepared from the intracellular pathogen itself or a closely related<br>
species. These old vaccine models were composed of the entire microorganism or subunits<br>
thereof. For example, the first, and currently only available vaccine, for Mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis is an attenuated live vaccine made from the closely related intracellular pathogen M.<br>
bovis. Recently, the present inventors have discovered that specific extracellular products of<br>
intracellular pathogens that are secreted into growth media can be used to illicit protective<br>
immune responses in mammals either as individual subunits, or in subunit combinations.<br>
However, these subunit vaccines have not proven to be superior to the original attenuated vaccine<br>
derived fromM bovis.<br>
The present invention details vaccines and immunotherapeutics composed of recombinant<br>
attenuated intracellular pathogens (vaccinating agents) that have been transformed to express the<br>
extracellular protein(s) (recombinant immunogenic antigens) of another or same intracellular<br>
pathogen. In one embodiment the vaccines of the present invention are made using recombinant<br>
strains of the Bacille Calmette and Guerin, or BCG. In this embodiment the recombinant BCG<br>
expresses major extracellular proteins of pathogenic mycobacteria including, but not limited to,<br>
M. tuberculosis, M. leprae andM bovis, to name but a few.<br>
The major extracellular proteins expressed by the recombinant BCG include, but are not<br>
limited to, the 12 kDa, 14 kDa, 16 kDa, 23 kDa, 23.5 kDa, 30 kDa, 32A kDa, 32B kDa, 45 kDa,<br>
58 kDa, 71 kDa, 80 kDa, and 110 kDa of Mycobacterium sp. and respective analogs, homologs<br>
and subunits thereof including recombinant non-fusion proteins, fusion proteins and derivatives<br>
thereof. It is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the molecular weights used to<br>
identify the major extracellular proteins of Mycobacteria and other intracellular pathogens are<br>
only intended to be approximations. Those skilled in the art of recombinant technology and<br>
molecular biology will realize that it is possible to co-express (co-translate) these proteins with<br>
additional amino acids, polypeptides and proteins, as it its also possible to express these<br>
proteins in truncated forms. The resulting modified proteins are still considered to be within<br>
the scope of the present invention whether termed native, non-fusion proteins, fusion proteins,<br>
hybrid proteins or chimeric proteins. For the purposes of the present invention, fusion proteins<br>
are defined to include, but not limited to, the products of two or more coding sequences from<br>
different genes that have been cloned together and that, after translation, form a single<br>
polypeptide sequence.<br>
The present invention also describes recombinant attenuated intracellular pathogen<br>
vaccinating agents that over express non-fusion proteins from at least one other intracellular<br>
pathogen. This is accomplished by using extrachromosomal nucleic acids to express at least<br>
one recombinant immunogenic antigen gene and placing this gene(s) under the control of non-<br>
heat shock gene promoters or non-stess protein gene promoters, preferably protein-specific<br>
promoter sequences. Consequently, vaccines are provided having non-fusion, recombinant<br>
immunogenic antigens expressed in greater quantities than possible when genes encoding for<br>
recombinant immunogenic antigens are stably integrated into the vaccinating agent's genomic<br>
DNA. As a result, intracellular pathogen vaccines having surprisingly superior specificity and<br>
potency than existing subunit or attenuated intracellular pathogen vaccines are provided.<br>
Moreover the present invention describes methods of treating and preventing<br>
mammalian diseases caused by intracellular pathogens using the vaccines of the present<br>
invention. A partial list of the many intracellular pathogens that may be used as the attenuated<br>
vaccinating agents and/or the source of the recombinant immunogenic antigens includes, but is<br>
not limited to, Mycobacterium bovis, M. ti/berculosis, M. leprae, M. kansasii, M. avium,<br>
Mycobacterium sp., Legionella pneumophila, L. longbeachae, L. bozemanii, Legionella sp.,<br>
Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia sp., Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia<br>
phagocytophila geno group, Ehrlichia sp., Coxiella burnetii, Leishmania sp, Toxpolasma<br>
gondii, Tiypanosoma cruzi, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia sp, Listeria monocytogenes,<br>
Listeria sp, and Histoplasma sp. In one embodiment of the present invention a recombinant<br>
BCG expressing the 30 kDa major extracellular protein of M. tuberculosis is administered to<br>
mammals using intradermal inoculations. However, it is understood that the vaccines of the<br>
present invention may be administered using any approach that will result in the appropriate<br>
immune response including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal,<br>
intraperitoneal, oral, or inhalation. Following a suitable post inoculation period, the mammals<br>
were challenged with an infectious M. tuberculosis aerosol. Mammals receiving the vaccine of<br>
the present invention were remarkably disease free as compared to mammals receiving BCG<br>
alone, the major extracellular protein alone, or any combinations thereof.<br>
Other objects and features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from a consideration of the following detailed description of preferred<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the Figures which will first be<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed generally to vaccines and immunotherapeutics for<br>
treating and preventing infections in humans and animals caused by intracellular pathogens.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is directed at optimizing intracellular pathogen antigen<br>
presentation to enable the immunotherapeutic and/or vaccine recipient to generate the<br>
maximum immune response to important therapeutic and prophylactic proteins. The present<br>
inventors, through years of research and experimentation, have surprisingly discovered that<br>
successful therapy and prophylaxis of intracellular pathogen infections using extracellular<br>
proteins derived from the intracellular pathogen is a function of protein presentation to the<br>
host.<br>
Antigen presentation encompasses a group of variables that determine how a recipient<br>
processes and responds to an antigen. These variables can include, but are not limited to,<br>
adjuvants, vaccine component concentration, carrier molecules, haptens, dose frequency and<br>
route of administration. The present inventors have demonstrated that identical antigens<br>
compounded differently will result in statistically significant response variations in genetically<br>
similar, hosts. For example, two vaccine preparations of the 30 kDa extracellular protein ofM.<br>
tuberculosis were compounded using the same protein and adjuvant concentrations. One group<br>
of guinea pigs was administered a vaccine containing only the 30 kDa protein and adjuvant; a<br>
second guinea pig group was administered the same vaccine as the first except that IL-12 was<br>
added to the second vaccine. When the mean immune responses of both groups were<br>
compared, the guinea pigs receiving the vaccine plus IL-12 demonstrated a statistically<br>
significant superior immune response.<br>
The present invention describes the union of two technologies, one known for over<br>
eighty years, the other a product of the 1990's. Together, they represent an entirely new and<br>
surprisingly effective approach to presenting intracellular pathogens' extracellular proteins to<br>
recipients and inducing remarkably robust protective immune responses thereto. The present<br>
inventors have attempted over 100 different antigen presentation methods using the<br>
extracellular proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as an exemplary intracellular pathogen.<br>
However, in spite of the many successes realized by the present inventors, none had induced an<br>
immune response superior to that seen using the BCG vaccine alone.<br>
Briefly stated, and intended solely as a general example, the present invention includes<br>
vaccines for intracellular pathogens using attenuated, or avirulent, recombinant intracellular<br>
pathogens (the "vaccinating agent") that express and secrete recombinant immunogenic<br>
antigens of the same, another species, or both (the "immunogen(s)"); the vaccinating agent and<br>
immunogen(s) are referred to collectively as the "vaccines" of the present invention. The<br>
vaccines are administered using one or more routes, including, but not limited to,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal, intraperitoneal, intradermal, oral, or inhalation. The<br>
vaccinating agents of the present invention survive within the recipient expressing and<br>
secreting the immunogen(s) in situ (status).<br>
Without wishing to be bound to this theory, the present inventors have proposed that<br>
the immunogenic antigens of opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella sp. can illicit<br>
protective immune responses with greater ease than similar immunogenic antigens of more<br>
traditional animal pathogens such as Mycobacterium sp. Selective pressures may have<br>
afforded pathogens such as Mycobacterium sp., that co-evolved with their natural hosts,<br>
immune evading mechanisms that incidental, or opportunistic, pathogens lack. Consequently,<br>
significantly more powerful vaccinating agents and immunogens must be developed to elicit<br>
protective immune responses against pathogenic Mycobacteria than those required to elicit<br>
protective immunity against pathogens for which humans are not a primary host.<br>
The present inventors have previously demonstrated the extracellular proteins from the<br>
opportunistic intracellular pathogen Legionella sp. affords animals significant immune<br>
protection when administered in purified form or in cocktails using either complete or<br>
incomplete Freund's adjuvant. (See USPN 5,108,745, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.) However, attempts to obtain similar protective immune responses using M.<br>
tuberculosis extracellular proteins under similar conditions have not been as successful.<br>
Consequently, the present inventors have proposed that over-expression of extracellular non-<br>
fusion proteins may be an important aspect of antigen presentation and the development of<br>
protective immune responses. However, it is understood that while the over-expression of non-<br>
fusion immunogenic extracellular proteins may be one important factor in eliciting protective<br>
immunity, it is not believed to be the only immunostimulatory factors the vaccines of the<br>
present invention provide.<br>
The present invention is ideally suited for preparing highly effective immunoprotective<br>
vaccines against a variety of intracellular pathogens including, but not limited to BCG strains<br>
over-expressing the major extracellular non-fusion proteins of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis or M.<br>
leprae. Each vaccine of the present invention can express at least one immunogen of various<br>
molecular weights specific for a given intracellular pathogen. For example, the present<br>
inventers have previously identified M. tuberculosis immunogens that can include, but are not<br>
limited to, the major extracellular proteins 12 kDa, 14 kDa, 16 kDa, 23 kDa, 23.5 kDa, 30 kDa,<br>
32A kDa, 32B kDa, 45 kDa, 58 kDa, 71 kDa, 80 kDa, 110 kDa and respective analogs,<br>
homologs and subunits thereof including recombinant non-fusion proteins, fusion proteins and<br>
derivatives thereof. (See pending United States Patent Applications serial numbers<br>
08/156,358, 09/157,689, 09/175,598, 09/226,539, and 09/322,116, the entire contents of which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference). It is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the<br>
molecular weights used to identify the major extracellular proteins of Mycobacteria and other<br>
intracellular pathogens are only intended to be approximations. Those skilled in the art of<br>
recombinant technology and molecular biology will realize that it is possible to co-express (co-<br>
translate) these proteins with additional amino acids, polypeptides and proteins, as it its also<br>
possible to express these proteins in truncated forms. The resulting modified proteins are still<br>
considered to be within the scope of the present invention whether termed native, non-fusion<br>
proteins, fusion proteins, hybrid proteins or chimeric proteins. For the purposes of the present<br>
invention, fusion proteins are defined to include, but not limited to, the products of two or more<br>
coding sequences from different genes that have been cloned together and that, after<br>
translation, form a single polypeptide sequence.<br>
Antigen expression, including extracellular proteins, is generally enhanced when genes<br>
encoding for recombinant non-fusion proteins are located on, and under the control of, one or<br>
more plasmids (extrachromosomal DNA) rather than integrated into the host genome.<br>
Moreover, protein expression driven by promoter sequences specific for a particular protein<br>
provide enhanced expression and improved protein folding and processing of non-fusion-<br>
protein antigens. Therefore, the present invention provides recombinant extracellular non-<br>
fusion proteins encoded on extrachromosomal DNA that are controlled by non-heat shock gene<br>
promoters or non-stress protein gene promoters, preferably protein-specific promoter<br>
sequences.<br>
The present invention provides recombinant attenuated intracellular pathogen<br>
vaccinating agents such as rBCG that express their own endogenous extracellular proteins in<br>
addition to recombinant extracellular non-fusion proteins of closely related and/or other<br>
intracellular pathogens. However, it has been demonstrated through 80 years of studies that<br>
BCG's endogenous extracellular proteins alone do not provide complete protection in all<br>
recipients. Furthermore, as will be explained in greater detail below, the present inventors<br>
have also demonstrated that merely co-injecting M. tuberculosis extracellular proteins along<br>
with traditional BCG does not result in vaccines superior to BCG alone.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the vaccine includes a recombinant BCG<br>
vaccinating agent expressing only one immunogen, for example the 30 kDa major extracellular<br>
protein ofM tuberculosis. In another embodiment of the present invention the recombinant<br>
BCG may express two or more immunogens, for example the 23.5 kDa and the 30 kDa major<br>
extracellular proteins of M. tuberculosis. This latter embodiment may be particularly effective<br>
as a vaccine for preventing diseases in mammals. The present inventors have proposed the<br>
non-limiting theory that the simultaneous over expression of the 23.5 kDa and the 30 kDa<br>
major extracellular proteins of M. tuberculosis by a recombinant BCG may act synergistically<br>
to heighten the mammalian protective immune response against the intracellular pathogens of<br>
the present invention. This theory is partially based on the observation that wild-type and<br>
recombinant BCG are deletion mutants of M bovis that do not naturally express their own 23.5<br>
kDa major extracellular protein.<br>
For brevity sake, and due to the immensely complex description that would ensue, but<br>
not intended as a limitation, the present invention will be more specifically described using a<br>
recombinant BCG as the vaccination agent and M. tuberculosis extracellular non-fusion<br>
proteins, specifically the 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein, as an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. It is understood that any recombinant immunogenic<br>
antigen may be expressed by any recombinant attenuated intracellular pathogen, and that the<br>
vaccines of the present invention are not limited to BCG as the vaccinating agent and the major<br>
extracellular non-fusion proteins ofM tuberculosis as the immunogens.<br>
In order to determine the effects of vaccinating agent strain variation, two different<br>
BCG strains were used to prepare the various embodiments of the present invention: BCG Tice<br>
and BCG Connaught, Wild-type M. bovisBCG Tice was purchased from Organon and wild-<br>
type M. bovis BCG Connaught was obtained from Connaught Laboratories, Toronto, Canada.<br>
The strains were maintained in 7H9 medium pH 6.7 (Difco) at 37°C in a 5% C02-95% air<br>
atmosphere as unshaken cultures. Cultures were sonicated once or twice weekly for 5 min in a<br>
sonicating water bath to reduce bacterial clumping.<br>
Recombinant BCG TICE (YBCG30 Tice) expressing theM tuberculosis 30 kDa major<br>
extracellular non-fusion protein was prepared as follows. The plasmid pMTB30, a<br>
recombinant construct of the E. co/Z/mycobacteria shuttle plasmid pSMT3, was prepared as<br>
previously described by the present inventors in Harth, G, B.-Y. Lee and M.A. Horwitz. 1997.<br>
High-level heterologous expression and secretion in rapidly growing nonpathogeiiic<br>
mycobacteria of four major Mycobacterium tuberculosis extracellular proteins considered to<br>
be leading vaccine candidates and drug targets. Infect. Immun. 65:2321-2328, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Briefly, plasmid pMTB30 was engineered to express the M. tuberculosis Erdman 30<br>
kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein from its own promoter (or any non-heat shock and<br>
non-stress protein gene promoter) by inserting a large genomic DNA restriction fragment<br>
containing the 30 kDa non-fusion protein gene plus extensive flanking DNA sequences into the<br>
plasmid's multi-cloning site using methods known to those skilled in the art of recombinant<br>
DNA technology. The plasmid was first introduced into K coli DH5a to obtain large<br>
quantities of the recombinant plasmid. The recombinant E. coli strain, which was unable to<br>
express the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa non-fusion protein, was grown in the presence of 250<br>
ug/ml hygromycin and the plasmid insert's DNA sequence was determined in its entirety. The<br>
plasmid was introduced into M. smegmatis by electroporation using 6.25 kV/cm, 25 uF, and<br>
1000 mfl as the conditions yielding the largest number of positive transformants. The present<br>
inventors verified the presence of the recombinant plasmid by growth in the presence of 50<br>
ug/ml hygromycin and the constitutive expression and export of recombinant 30 kDa non-<br>
fusion protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immuoblotting with polyvalent,<br>
highly specific rabbit anti-30 kDa non-fusion protein immunoglobulin using methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art of recombinant DNA technology. Additionally, the inventors verified<br>
the cprrect expression and processing of the recombinant M. tuberculosis 30 kDa non-fusion<br>
protein, which was indistinguishable from its native counterpart by N-terminal amino acid<br>
sequencing.<br>
The recombinant pSMT3 plasmid pMTBSO was subsequently introduced intoM bovis<br>
BCG Tice using 6.25 kV/cm, 25 F, and 200 as the optimal electroporation conditions.<br>
Transformants were incubated in 7H9 medium supplemented with 2% glucose for 4 h at 37°C<br>
in an environmental shaker and subsequently plated on 7H11 agar with 20 ug/ml hygromycin.<br>
The concentration of hygromycin was gradually increased to 50 ug/ml as the transformants<br>
were subcultured to a new growth medium. Recombinant BCG Tice cultures were maintained<br>
under the same conditions as the wild-type except that the 7H9 medium contained 50 (ig/ml<br>
hygromycin.<br>
The expression and export of recombinant M. tuberculosis 30 kDa non-fusion protein<br>
were verified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with polyvalent,<br>
highly specific rabbit anti-30 kDa non-fusion protein immunoglobulin. Typically, 1 in 10<br>
transformants expressed and exported significantly larger quantities of recombinant non-fusion<br>
protein than the other transformants; 2 such transformants were chosen and a large stock of<br>
these transformants was prepared and frozen at -70° C in 7H9 medium containing 10%<br>
glycerol. These transformants were used for vaccine efficacy studies in guinea pigs. FIG la<br>
shows the expression of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein by<br>
recombinant BCG Tice on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblots. The recombinant strain<br>
expressed much more of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein<br>
than the wild-type both on Coomassie blue stained gels and immunoblots.<br>
Next a recombinant M. bovis BCG Connaught strain (rBCG30 Conn) expressing theM<br>
tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein was prepared similarly to that<br>
described above for recombinant BCG Tice (rBCG30 Tice) using the aforementioned pMTB30<br>
plasmid. It was maintained in medium containing hygromycin at a concentration of 50 ug/ml<br>
under the same conditions as described for the recombinant BCG Tice strain. FIG. lb shows<br>
the expression of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein by<br>
recombinant BCG Connaught on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblots. The recombinant strain<br>
expressed much more of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein<br>
than the wild-type both on Coomassie blue stained gels and immunoblots.<br>
Plasmid stability of recombinant strains of BCG was assessed biochemically. This<br>
biochemical analysis demonstrated that in the presence of hygromycin, broth cultures of the<br>
recombinant BCG strains maintain a steady level of recombinant non-fusion protein expression<br>
over a 3 month growth period. In the absence of hygromycin, the same cultures show only a<br>
slight decrease of non-fusion protein expression (on a per cell basis), indicating that the<br>
recombinant plasmid is stably maintained and only very gradually lost in bacteria growing<br>
without selective pressure (FIG. la and FIG. lb, lane 3).<br>
It is understood that using the methods described above in conjunction with methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art of recombinant DNA technology, recombinant BCG strains<br>
expressing theM tuberculosis 32(A) kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein, 16 kDa major<br>
extracellular non-fusion protein, 23.5 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein, and other M.<br>
tuberculosis major extracellular non-fusion proteins can be prepared. Furthermore, similar<br>
methodologies can be used to prepare recombinant BCG strains expressing M. leprae major<br>
extracellular non-fusion proteins including, but not limited to the M. leprae 30 kDa major<br>
extracellular non-fusion protein homolog of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular<br>
non-fusion protein (a.k.a. Antigen 85B), the M. leprae 32(A) kDa major extracellular non-<br>
fusion protein homolog of the M. tuberculosis 32(A) kDa major extracellular non-fusion<br>
protein (a.k.a. Antigen 85A), and other M. leprae major extracellular non-fusion proteins.<br>
Additionally, similar methodologies also can be used to prepare recombinant M. bovis BCG<br>
expressing the M. bovis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein homolog of the M<br>
tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein (a.lca. Antigen 85B), the M. bovis<br>
32(A) kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein homolog of theM tuberculosis 32(A) kDa<br>
major extracellular protein (a.k.a. Antigen 85A), and other M. bovis major extracellular<br>
proteins.<br>
Following the successful vaccine production the vaccines of the present invention are<br>
tested for safety and efficacy using an animal model. The studies utilized guinea pigs because<br>
the guinea pig model is especially relevant to human tuberculosis clinically, immunologically,<br>
and pathologically. In contrast to the mouse and rat, but like the human, the guinea pig a) is<br>
susceptible to low doses of aerosolized M. tuberculosis; b) exhibits strong cutaneous DTH to<br>
tuberculin; and c) displays Langhans giant cells and caseation in pulmonary lesions. However,<br>
whereas only about 10% of immunocompetent humans who are infected withM tuberculosis<br>
develop active disease over their lifetime (half early after exposure and half after a period of<br>
latency), infected guinea pigs always develop early active disease. While guinea pigs differ<br>
from humans in this respect, the consistency with which they develop active disease after<br>
infection withM tuberculosis is an advantage in trials of vaccine efficacy.<br>
. The immunization inoculums made in accordance with the teachings of the present<br>
invention were prepared from aliquots removed from logarithmically growing wild type or<br>
recombinant BCG cultures (the "bacteria"). Each aliquot of bacteria was pelleted by<br>
centrifugation at 3,500 x g for 15 min and then washed with 1 x phosphate buffered saline (1 x<br>
PBS, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7, 150 mM sodium chloride). The immunization<br>
inoculums were then resuspended to a final concentration of 1 x 104 colony forming units per<br>
ml in 1 x PBS and contained 1,000 viable bacteria per 100 ul.<br>
Specific-pathogen free 250-300 g outbred male Hartley strain guinea pigs from Charles<br>
River Breeding Laboratories, in groups of 9, were immunized intradermally with one of the<br>
following: 1) BCG Connaught [103 Colony Forming Units (CFU)] one time only (time 0<br>
weeks); 2) rBCG30 Connaught (103 CFU) one time only (time 0 weeks); 3) purified<br>
recombinant M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein (r30), 100 ug in<br>
100 ul Syntex adjuvant formulation (SAF), three times three weeks apart (time 0, 3, and 6<br>
weeks); SAF consisted of Pluronic L121, squalane, and Tween 80, and in the first<br>
immunization, alanyl muramyl dipeptide; and 4) SAF only (100 p) (Sham-immunized), three<br>
times three weeks apart (time 0, 3, and 6 weeks). An additional group of 3 animals was sham-<br>
immunized with SAF only (100 ul) and used as a skin test control. These and three to six other<br>
sham-immunized animals served as uninfected controls in the challenge experiments.<br>
Nine weeks after the only immunization (BCG and rBCG30 groups) or first<br>
immunization (r30 group and sham-immunized skin-test group), guinea pigs were shaved over<br>
the back and injected intradermally with 10 ug of purified recombinant M. tuberculosis 30 kDa<br>
major extracellular non-fusion protein (r30) in 100 pi phosphate buffered saline. After 24<br>
hours, the diameter of erythema and induration was measured. (A separate group of sham-<br>
immunized animals from the ones used in the challenge studies was used for skin-testing.<br>
Sham-immunized animals used in challenge studies were not skin-tested to eliminate the<br>
possibility that the skin-test itself might influence the outcome).<br>
Nine weeks after the first or only immunization and immediately after skin-testing,<br>
animals were challenged with an aerosol generated from a 10 ml single-cell suspension<br>
containing 1 x 105 colony-forming units (CFU) of M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis Erdman strain (ATCC 35801) was passaged through outbred guinea pigs to<br>
maintain virulence, cultured on 7H11 agar, subjected to gentle sonication to obtain a single cell<br>
suspension, and frozen at -70°C for use in animal challenge experiments. The challenge<br>
aerosol dose delivered ~40 live bacilli to the lungs of each animal. The airborne route of<br>
infection was used because this is the natural route of infection for pulmonary tuberculosis. A<br>
large dose was used so as to induce measurable clinical illness in 100% of control animals<br>
within a relatively short time frame (10 weeks). Afterwards, guinea pigs were individually<br>
housed in stainless steel cages contained within a laminar flow biohazard safety enclosure and<br>
allowed free access to standard laboratory chow and water. The animals were observed for<br>
illness and weighed weekly for 10 weeks and then euthanized. The right lung and spleen of<br>
each animal were removed and cultured for CFU o£M. tuberculosis.<br>
In each of the two experiments, the sham-immunized animals and animals immunized<br>
with wild-type BCG exhibited little or no erythema and induration upon testing with<br>
recombinant 30 kDaM tuberculosis major extracellular non-fusion protein (r30). In contrast,<br>
animals immunized with r30 or rBCG30 exhibited marked erythema and induration that was<br>
significantly higher than in the sham-immunized or wild-type BCG immunized animals (Table<br>
1 and FIG. 2).<br>
In each of the two experiments, uninfected controls gained weight normally after<br>
challenge as did animals immunized with either rBCG30 or wild-type BCG (FIG. 3). Indeed<br>
there were no significant differences in weight gain among these three groups. In contrast,<br>
sham-immunized animals and to a lesser extent r30 immunized animals, exhibited diminished<br>
weight gain over the course of the experiment (Table 2 and FIG. 3). Hence, after challenge<br>
withM. tuberculosis, both BCG and rBCG30 protected animals completely from weight loss, a<br>
major physical sign of tuberculosis in humans, and a hallmark of tuberculosis in the guinea pig<br>
model of this chronic infectious disease.<br>
In each of the two experiments, at the end of the 10 week observation period, guinea pigs<br>
were euthanized and the right lung and spleen of each animal was removed aseptically and<br>
assayed for CFU of M. tuberculosis. Sham-immunized animals had the highest bacterial load<br>
in the lungs and spleen (Table 3 and FIG. 4a and FIG. 4b). Animals immunized with r30 had<br>
fewer organisms in the lungs and spleen than the sham-immunized animals; BCG-immunized<br>
animals had fewer organisms than r30-immunized animals; and remarkably, rBCG30-<br>
immunized animals had fewer organisms than BCG-immunized animals. Statistical tests<br>
employing two way factorial analysis of variance methods to compare means demonstrated that<br>
the means of the four "treatment" groups (Sham, r30, BCG, and rBCG30) in Experiment 1<br>
were not significantly different from the means of the four treatment groups in Experiment 2<br>
and that it was therefore appropriate to combine the data in the two experiments. The<br>
combined data is shown in Table 4 and FIG. 3. Of greatest interest and importance, the<br>
rBCG30-immunized animals had 0.5 log fewer organisms in the Jungs and nearly 1 log fewer<br>
organisms in the spleen than BCG-immunized animals. On statistical analysis, employing<br>
analysis of variance methods to compare means and the Tukey-Fisher least significant<br>
difference (LSD) criterion to assess statistical significance, the mean of each of the four groups<br>
in both the lungs and spleens was significantly different from the mean of each of the others<br>
(Table 4). Differences between the rBCGSO and BCG immunized animals in the lungs were<br>
significant at p=0.02 and in the spleens at p=0.001. Paralleling the differences in CFU in the<br>
lungs, on gross inspection, lungs of rBCG30-immunized animals had less lung destruction than<br>
BCG-immunized animals (20 ± 4% versus 35 + 5% mean ± SE).<br>
Thus, administration of recombinant BCG expressing theM tuberculosis 30 kDa major<br>
extracellular non-fusion protein induced high level protection against aerosol challenge with M<br>
tuberculosis in the highly susceptible guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis. In contrast,<br>
as described in the examples below, administration of the same mycobacterial extracellular<br>
non-fusion protein (the M. tuberculosis recombinant 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion<br>
protein) in adjuvant in combination with BCG does not induce high level protection against<br>
aerosol challenge withM tuberculosis; nor does administration of recombinant M. smegmatis<br>
expressing the PI. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein; nor does<br>
administration of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular non-fusion protein in<br>
microspheres that are of the same approximate size as BCG and like BCG slowly release the<br>
proteins over 60-90 days; nor does administration of the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major<br>
extracellular non-fusion protein encapsulated in liposomes.<br>
A very surprising aspect of this invention is that the rBCG30 strain induced protection<br>
superior to wild-type BCG even though the wild-type expresses and secretes an endogenous<br>
highly homologous 30 kDa major extracellular protein. (See FIG. 1). The gene encoding the<br>
30 kDa protein from substrain BCG Connaught has not been sequenced. However, the<br>
sequence of the 30 kDa protein of two other substrains of BCG, deduced from the sequence of<br>
the cloned gene of these substrains, differs from theM tuberculosis protein by only one amino<br>
acid (BCG Paris 1173 P2) or by 5 amino acids including two additional amino acids (BCG<br>
Tokyo). (See pages 3041-3042 of Flarth, G., B.-Y. Lee, J. Wang, D.L. Clemens, and M.A.<br>
Horwitz. 1996. Novel insights into the genetics, biochemistry, and imrmmocytochemisliy of<br>
the 30-lcilodalton major extracellular protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infect. Immun.<br>
64:3038-3047 the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). Hence, the<br>
improved protection of the recombinant strain is unlikely to be due to the small amino acid<br>
difference between the recombinant and endogenous proteins. More likely, it is due to the<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the novel aspect of the present invention.<br>
Each example illustrates a means of delivering the immunogens of the present invention using<br>
techniques closely related to, but different from the vaccine of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, Example 1 demonstrates that when the immunogens of the present invention are<br>
administered with, but not expressed in vivo by BCG, a high level of protective immunity is<br>
not achieved.<br>
Example 2 demonstrates that the in vivo expression of the immunogens of the present<br>
invention using a Mycobacterium sp. closely related to BCG, but unable to replicate in<br>
mammalian hosts, fails to induce significant levels of protection against challenge with M.<br>
tuberculosis. Examples 3 and 4 demonstrate that the slow release of the immunogens of the<br>
present invention by synthetic vaccine microcarriers also fails to induce significant levels of<br>
protection against challenge withM tuberculosis.<br>
Therefore, the following Examples serve to highlight the completely surprising and<br>
remarkable advance that the intracellular pathogen vaccines of the present invention represents<br>
to the field of infectious disease immunology.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Immunization of guinea pigs with BCG plus recombinant M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major<br>
extracellular protein (V30) does not induce high level protection against challenge with M.<br>
tuberculosis.<br>
We previously immunized guinea pigs with BCG plus r30 in a powerful adjuvant (SAF,<br>
Syntex Adjuvant Formulation). The r30 protein (100 u.g per immunization) was administered<br>
intradermally three times. This induced a strong cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (C-<br>
DTH) response to r30 (FIG. 5). Indeed, the C-DTH response was comparable to that induced<br>
by recombinant BCG expressing r30. Nevertheless, immunization with both BCG and r30 did<br>
not induce high level protection against challenge with M. tuberculosis (Table 5). Animals<br>
immunized with both BCG and r30 did not have lower levels of CFU in the lungs and spleen<br>
than animals immunized with BCG alone. This result is in direct contrast to the result<br>
described above in which animals immunized with recombinant BCG expressing r30 exhibited<br>
high level protection when challenged withM tuberculosis.<br>
Example 2<br>
Immunization of guinea pigs with live recombinant M. smegniatis expressing the M.<br>
tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein fr30) in a form indistinguishable from the<br>
native form does not induce high level protection against challenge withM tuberculosis.<br>
In one of the same experiments in which we immunized animals with BCG, we<br>
immunized guinea pigs with live recombinant M smegmatis expressing theM tuberculosis 30<br>
kDa major extracellular protein (r30) in a form indistinguishable from the native form. The<br>
expression and secretion of theM tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein (r30) by M.<br>
smegmatis was equal to or greater than that of the recombinant BCG strain expressing and<br>
secreting the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein. Moreover, the dose of<br>
recombinant M smegmatis, 10 bacteria, was very high, one million times the dose of<br>
recombinant BCG (I03 bacteria), to more than compensate for the poor multiplication of M.<br>
smegmatis in the animal host. To compensate even further, the recombinant M. smegmatis was<br>
administered three times intradermally, whereas the recombinant BCG was administered only<br>
once intradermally. Immunization with recombinant M. smegmatis expressing the r30 protein<br>
induced a strong cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (C-DTH) response to r30. Indeed,<br>
the C-DTH response was comparable to or greater than that induced by recombinant BCG<br>
expressing r30. Nevertheless, the live recombinant M. smegmatis expressing the M.<br>
tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein did not induce high level protection against<br>
challenge with M. tuberculosis (Table 6). Animals immunized with the live recombinant M.<br>
smegmatis expressing the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein did not have<br>
lower levels of CFU in the lungs and spleen than animals immunized with BCG alone. This<br>
result is in direct contrast to the result described above in which animals immunized with<br>
recombinant BCG expressing r30 exhibited high level protection when challenged with M.<br>
tuberculosis.<br>
Example 3<br>
Immunization of guinea pigs with microspheres that are of the same approximate size<br>
as BCG and like BCG slowly release theM tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein<br>
MO) over 60 - 90 days does not induce high level protection against challenge with M.<br>
tuberculosis.<br>
In one of the same experiments in which we immunized animals with rBCG30 and<br>
BCG, we immunized guinea pigs with microspheres that are of the same approximate size as<br>
BCG and like BCG slowly release theM tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein (r30)<br>
over 60 - 90 days. One set of animals was immunized once with microspheres containing 10<br>
mg of r30. Another set of animals was immunized three times with microspheres containing<br>
3.3 mg of r30. This amount was calculated to greatly exceed the amount of r30 protein<br>
expressed by the recombinant BCG strain. Immunization with either regimen of microspheres<br>
induced a strong cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (C-DTH) response to r30. Indeed,<br>
the C-DTH response was comparable to that induced by recombinant BCG expressing r30.<br>
Nevertheless, immunization with the microspheres that are of the same approximate size as<br>
BCG and like BCG slowly release the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein did<br>
not induce high level protection against challenge with M. tuberculosis (Table 7). Animals<br>
immunized with the microspheres did not have lower levels of CFU in the lungs and spleen<br>
than animals immunized with BCG alone. This result is in direct contrast to the result<br>
described above in which animals immunized with recombinant BCG expressing r30 exhibited<br>
high level protection when challenged withM tuberculosis.<br>
Example 4<br>
- Immunization of guinea pigs with liposomes containing the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa<br>
major extracellular protein does not induce high level protection against challenge with M.<br>
tuberculosis.<br>
In the same experiment as in Example 3, we immunized guinea pigs with liposomes<br>
containing the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein. The animals were<br>
immunized three times with liposomes containing 50 u.g of r30. This induced a moderately<br>
strong cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (C-DTH) response to r30. The C-DTH<br>
response was greater than that induced by BCG and control liposomes but less than that<br>
induced by recombinant BCG expressing r30. Nevertheless, immunization with liposomes<br>
containing the M. tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein did not induce high level<br>
protection against challenge with M. tuberculosis (Table 7). Animals immunized with the<br>
liposomes containing theM tuberculosis 30 kDa major extracellular protein did not have lower<br>
levels of CFU in the lungs and spleen than animals immunized with BCG alone. This result is<br>
in direct contrast to the result described above in which animals immunized with recombinant<br>
BCG expressing r30 exhibited high level protection when challenged withM tuberculosis.<br>
The vaccines of the present invention represent an entirely new approach to the<br>
therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of intracellular pathogens. Through a series of well<br>
designed experiments and thoughtful analysis, the present inventors have thoroughly<br>
demonstrated that protective immunity is only achieved when a precisely selected intracellular<br>
pathogen, or closely related species, is transformed to express recombinant extracellular<br>
proteins of the same or different intracellular pathogen in accordance with the teachings of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention can also be used to provide prophylactic and therapeutic benefits<br>
against multiple intracellular pathogens simultaneously. For example a recombinant attenuated<br>
intracellular vaccinating agent like M. bovis can be designed to expressed immuno-protective<br>
immunogens against M. tuberculosis and Legionella sp. simultaneously. Consequently, great<br>
efficiencies in delivering vaccines could be accomplished. The non-limiting examples of<br>
recombinant BCG expressing the major extracellular proteins ofM tuberculosis not only serve<br>
as a fully enabling embodiment of the present invention, but represent a significant advance to<br>
medicine, and humanity as a whole.<br>
Therefore, it is apparent that while a preferred embodiment of the invention has been<br>
shown and described, various modifications and changes may be made without departing from<br>
the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
