This invention refers to a new process for the synthesis of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxy-lic acid dichloride of formula (I)<br><br>
The compound of formula (I) is an useful intermediate for the preparation of iodinated X-ray contrast media.<br>
The synthesis of said compound has been previously described, for instance in patents WO 9405337, WO 9109007, EP 118347, EP 83964, EP 23992, CH 616403, CH 608189, DE 2710730, DE 2547789.<br>
In some references the reaction of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid with thionyl chloride is described without addition of solvent (DE 2547789, DE 2710730, CH 608189, CH 616403, EP 23992), or with a small amount of dimethylformamide, as a catalyst (EP 118347): the resulting yields are satisfactory.<br>
On the other hand the reaction carried out in thionyl chloride without solvent causes serious problems of industrial safety. If from one hand it is difficult to have a step-by-step loading of the starting product,<br><br>
which is a solid, in hot tmionyl chloride, on the other hand the addition, the cold mixing of the two reagents and the successive heating can generate a fugitive reaction with unforeseeable effects.<br>
In other references the reaction is carried out in ethyl acetate (WO 9405337, WO 9109007, EP 83964). In this case the declared yields drop sharply (50-60%).<br>
From the industrial point of view it is very important to exploit a synthetic process which can be operated in safe operation conditions and leads to good yields of pure product without further purifications (crystallisation, and so on).<br>
The process of this invention refers to the chlorination of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicar-boxylic acid in heterogeneous phase in a solvent selected from the group consisting of: (C7-C16) linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, (C7-C8) aromatic hydrocarbons, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, n-butylacetate, diglyme (diethylenglycoldimethylether), with catalytic amounts of tertiary amine.<br>
Particularly preferred are the following conditions of chlorination, relative to the process of this invention:<br>
the hydrocarbon is selected from the group of (Cg-C14) linear or branched hydrocarbons, said hydrocarbons are preferably n-octane, n-decane, n-dodecane, ligroin, kerosene;<br>
the aromatic hydrocarbon is selected from the group of benzene substituted by methyl groups, preferably said aromatic hydrocarbons are toluene or xylene, tertiary amine is selected from N-methyl-morpholine,<br><br>
triethylamine, quinoline, 2-, 3- or 4-dimethylamino-<br>
pyridine, 2-ethyl-5-methylpyridine. When the reaction of chlorination is carried out in (C7-C16) linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons the intermediate of formula (II), 5-sulphinylamino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride can be isolated.<br><br>
The process can be carried out either with or without isolation of said intermediate (II), obtaining in both cases analogous yields and purity in the final product.<br>
This invention is also aimed to achieve an isolated product in high yield and with a high purity of the final product, through the addition to the reaction mixture, after completion of the chlorination reaction of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, or to the isolated intermediate (II), of an amount of diglyme, so that the final mixture contains not less than 0.5 kg of diglyme/kg of the starting product and through the subsequent addition of water.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzenedicarboxy1ic acid dichloride, comprising the reaction in heterogeneous phase between 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benezenedicarboxy1ic acid and thionyl chloride, in a solvent selected from the group consisting of : (c7~ci6) linear or branched hydrocarbons, (Cy-Cg) aromatic hydrocarbons, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, n-butylacetate, diglyme (diethylenglycoledimethylether), and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine and recovery of the dichloride by methods known per se.<br>
The   following  examples aim at  describing  the   experimental conditions in order to perform the process of this invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
5-amino-2/4,6-triiodo-l,3-ben2enedicarboxylic acid dich-loride<br><br>
A)	5-amino-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid<br>
325 g 5-nitro-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (product available on the market) are loaded into a reactor with 2.8 1 of water. It is heated to 60-70°C and the starting product dissolved by addition of 410 g of 30% NaOH. Then 10 g of charcoal are added; the slurry is filtered and the filter is washed with 200 ml of water.<br>
8 g of Pd/C 5% (product available on the market) are then loaded and conditioned with aprox. 0.01 m3 nitrogen. 0.1 m3 hydrogen are added under a pressure of 30 kPa. The temperature spontaneously reaches 50"C and is kept by cooling. When the hydrogen consumption stops, the solution is kept under pressure for 1 h and then the residual hydrogen is removed by washing with 0.02 m3 of nitrogen. The suspension is filtered and the filter washed with 100 ml of water giving aprox. 3.85 kg of solution containing 5-amino-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid sodium salt.<br>
B)	5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid<br>
In a reactor loaded with 2.75 1 of water, are added<br><br>
in sequence 0.08 kg of HC1 (34% w/w), 3.85 kg of<br>
solution of 5-amino-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid sodium<br>
salt coming from the previous reaction and 375 g of<br>
H2SO4 (1:1 aqueous solution). The content is heated to<br>
70*C, and during 3 hours 1.35 kg of a solution of IC1 in<br>
HC1 (44.5% iodine, molar ratio IC1:HC1=1:1) (product<br>
available on the market) is added. When the addition is<br>
complete the solution is heated to 90 "C and the<br>
temperature kept for 6h. Then the content is cooled to<br>
60 "C and transferred to another reactor, where it is<br>
cooled to 30°C. The slurry is decolourised by adding 45<br>
g of sodium bisulfite under stirring, then centrifuged<br>
and the product washed with 0.3 kg of water thus giving<br>
935 g of the desired wet product. After drying, 830 g of<br>
the desired product are obtained.<br>

(on the anhydrous product): 95.0%<br>
Water content:	2%<br>
Potentiometric assay:      99.3%<br>

Thereafter 5004-600 g of a SOCl2/meta-xylene mixture containing 10% of this last one are added during 2h, and then 1 kg of SOClj is added in 4r6 h, by keeping the temperature between 65 and 70*C. When the addition terminates the mixture is heated at SO-rSS'C in 2h and<br><br>
this temperature is kept for 6 h, in order to complete the reaction. Then the mixture is cooled at 404-50°C, the pressure is reduced to 100 mbar and a SOCl2/meta-xylene mixture containing 10% of this last one is distilled off.<br>
The pressure is then raised to 1 atm with nitrogen and always under nitrogen atmosphere and under stirring, 1.1 kg of diglyme is added while the temperature is kept between 404-50"C.<br>
Thereafter the pH is kept to 2.54-3 by adding 2804-240 g of NaOH (134-15% aqueous solution). Then 300 g of water are added and the pH is kept to 6 by adding 6904-590 g of NaOH (134-15% aqueous solution); the slurry is then diluted with 1504-180 g of water, at a temperature of 30°C.<br>
The suspension is filtered under nitrogen atmosphere and the wet product is washed until the washing waters reach pH 7.<br>
The product is dried at a temperature of 504-65*0,<br>
giving 1.180 kg of the desired product.<br>

11.	The process according to claim 4, wherein the 5-<br>
sulphinylamino-2,4,6-t ri iodo-1,3-benzendicarboxylic acid<br>
dichloride obtained as an intermediate is isolated through<br>
filtration from the reaction mixture and is successively<br>
transformed into 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzendicarboxylic<br>
acid dichloride by known means.<br><br>
12.	The process according to claim 1, in which an amount of<br>
diglyme greater than 0.5 kg of diglyme/kgof starting product is<br>
added to the reaction mixture, after completion of the<br>
chlorination reaction of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-<br>
benzenedicarboxylic acid and successively treated with water to<br>
give 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid<br>
dichloride.<br>
13.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said 5-amino-<br>
2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid is prepared by known<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of 5-nitro-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid<br>
under basic conditions to produce an aqueous solution of 5-amino-<br>
1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid sodium salt which is subsequently<br>
iodinated without purification in a solution of IC1 in HCl to<br>
produce the said 5-amino-2,4,5-triiodo-1,3 benzenecarboxylic<br>
acid.<br>
14.	A process for the preparation of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1, 3-<br>
benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride, substantially as herein<br>
described and exemplified.<br><br></td>
