•The present invention relates to novel drugs for systemic use and non systemic use, and che composition thereof, to be used in oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfuntions cases.<br>
By oxidative stress it is meant the generation of free radicals or radicalic compounds, which causes injury both of the cell and that of the surrounding tissue (Pathophysiology: the biological basis for disease in adults and children, McCance &amp; Huether 1998 pages 48-54).<br>
By endothelial dysfunctions it is meant those relating to the vasal endothelium. The damage of the vasal endothelium is known as one of those important events that can cause a series of pathological processes affecting various organs and body apparatuses, as described hereinafter (Pathophysiology: The biological basis for disease in adults and children, McCance &amp; Huether 1998 page 1025).<br>
As known, the oxidative stress and/or the endothelial dysfunctions are associated to various pathologies as reported hereinafter. The oxidative stress can also be caused by toxicity of a great variety of drugs, which significantly af¬fects their performances.<br><br>
Said pathological events are of a chronic, debilitating character and are very often typical of the elderly . As already said, in said pathological conditions the drugs used show a remarkably worsened performance.<br>
Examples of pathological situations caused by the oxida¬tive stress and/or by the endothelial dysfunctions, or present in elderly, are the following:<br>
For the cardiovascular system: myocardial and vascular ischaemia in general, hypertension, stroke, arterioscle¬rosis, etc.<br>
For the connective tissue: rheumatoid arthritis and con¬nected inflammatory diseases, etc.<br>
For the pulmonary system: asthma and connected inflammatory diseases, etc.<br>
For the gastrointestinal system: ulcerative and non ul¬cerative dyspepsias, intestinal inflammatory diseases, etc.<br>
For the central nervous system: Alzheimer disease, etc. For the urogenital system: impotence, incontinence. For the cutaneous system: eczema, neurodermatitis, acne. The infective diseases in general (ref .: Schwarz-KB, Brady "Oxidative stress during viral infection: A review" Free radical Biol. Med. 21/5, 641-649 1996).<br>
Further the ageing process can be considered as a true pathologic condition (ref. Pathophysiology: the biological<br><br>
basis for disease in adults and children, pages 71-77).<br>
The known drugs when administered to patients having pathologies associated to oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, show a lower activity and/or higher toxicity.<br>
This happens for example for drugs such as the antiinflammatory, cardiovascular drugs, respiratory apparatus drugs, central nervous system drugs, bone system drugs, antibiotics, urogenital, endocrine drugs, etc.<br>
Drug research is directed to find new molecules having an improved therapeutic index (efficacy/toxicity ratio) or a lower risk/benefit ratio, also for pathological conditions as those above mentioned, wherein the therapeutic index of a great number of drugs results lowered. In fact in the above mentioned conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, many drugs show a lower activity and/or higher toxicity.<br>
For instance antiinflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs and anticolitic drugs, such as 5-aminosalicylic acid and its derivatives, show the following drawbacks. NSAIDs result toxic particularly when the organism is debilitated or affected by morbid conditions associated to oxidative stress. Said condi¬tions are for example the following: age, pre-existing ulcer, pre-existing gastric bleeding, debilitating chronic diseases such as in particular those affecting cardiovascular, renal apparatuses, the haematic crasis, etc. ("Misoprostol reduces serious  gastrointestinal  complications  in  patients  with<br><br>
rheuinatoid arthritis receiving non-steroidal anti-inf lainmatory drugs. A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial." F.E. Silverstein et Al. , Ann. Intern. Med. 123/4, 241-9, 1SS5; Martindale 31a ed. 1996, pag. 73, Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 1998, pages 431 and 794).<br>
The adminisuration of anti-inflammatory drugs to patients in the above men-ioned pathological conditions can be made only at doses lower than those used in therapy in order to avoid remarkable toxicity phenomena. Thus anti-inflammatory activity results poor.<br>
Beta-blockers, used for the angina, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia treatment, show side effects towards the respiratory apparatus (dyspnoea, bronchoconstriction), and therefore they can cause problems in patients affected by pathologies to said organs (asthma, bronchitis). Therefore be¬ta-blockers further worsen respiratory diseases such as asthma. Therefore in asthmatic patients reduced doses of said drugs must be used in order "not to jeopardize even more the respi¬ratory functionality. Thus the efficacy of the beta-blockers results very reduced.<br>
Antithrombotics, such as for example dipyridamole, aspirin, etc., used for the prophylaxis of thrombotic phenomena, have the same drawbacks. In patients affected by pathologies connected to oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, the therapeutic action or the tolerability of<br><br>
these drugs, as in the case of aspirin, is greatly reduced.<br>
Bronchodilators for example salbutamol, etc., are used in the asthma and bronchitis treatment and drugs active on the cholinergic system are used in pathologies such as urinary cholinergic incontinence. Their administration can produce similar side effects affecting the cardiovascular apparatus, causing problems both to cardiopathic and to hypertensive patients. Cardiopathies and hypertension are pathologies associated, as above said, to the oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions. Also these drugs show the same drawbacks as those above mentioned.<br>
Expectorant and mucolytic drugs, which are used in the therapy of inflammatory states of the respiratory organs, show drawbacks in patients affected by the above described condi¬tions. Their administration can give rise to heartburn and gastric irritability, particularly in the elderly.<br>
Bone resorption inhibitors, such as diphosphonates (for example alendronate, etc.) are drugs showing high gastro¬intestinal toxicity. Therefore also these drugs can show the same drawbacks as those above mentioned.<br>
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as for example sildenafil, zaprinast, used in the cardiovascular and respiratory system diseases, are charaterized by similar problems as to tolerability and/or efficacy in the mentioned pathological conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial<br><br>
dysfuntions.<br>
Antiallergic drugs, for exair.ple cetirizine, montelukast, etc. show similar problems in the mentioned pathological conditions, particularly for that it concerns their efficacy.<br>
Anti-angiotensin drugs, f.i. ACE-inhibitors, for example enalapril, captopril, etc., and receptor inhibitors, for example losartan, etc., are used in the cardiovascular disease treatment. Their drawback is to give side effects 'to the respiratory apparatus (i.e. cough, etc.) in the above mentioned pathological conditions.<br>
Antidiabetic drugs, both of the insulin-sensitizing and of hypoglycaemizing type, such as for example sulphonylureas, tolbutamide, glypiride, glyclazide, glyburide, nicotinamide etc., are ineffective in the prophylaxis of diabetic complications. Their administration can give side effects, such as for example gastric lesions. These phenomena become more intense in the pathological conditions above mentioned.<br>
Antibiotics, for example ampicillin, clarihtromycin, etc., and antiviral drugs, acyclovir, etc., show problems as regards their tolerability, for example they cause gastro-intestinal irritability.<br>
Antitumoral drugs, for example doxorubicine, daunorubicin, cisplatinum, etc., have high toxicity, towards different organs, among which are stomach and intestine. Said toxicity is further   worsened in the above mentioned pathologies of<br><br>
oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions.<br>
Antideraentia drugs for example nicotine and colino-mimetics, are characterized by a poor tolerability especially in the above mentioned pathologies.<br>
The need was felt to have available drugs showing an improved therapeutic performance, i.e. endowed both of a lower toxicity and/or higher efficacy, so that they could be administered to patients in morbid conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, without showing the drawbacks of the drugs of the prior art.<br>
It has now surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the aforementioned problems evidenced the administration of drugs, to patients affected by oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, or to the elderly in general, are solved by a novel class of drugs as described hereinafter.<br>

Tests 1-3 that are carried out for selecting the precursor drug (hereafter indicated in the tests also as "drug") to be used for the synthesis of the products of the invention are in details the following:<br>
Test 1 (NEM) : evaluation of the gastrointestinal damage from oxidative stress induced by free radicals formed following administration of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (H.G. Utley, F. Bemheim, P. Hochstein "Effects of sulphydril reagents on pe¬roxidation in microsomes" Archiv. Biochem. Biophys. 118, 29-32 1967).<br>
The animals (rats) are distributed in the following groups (no. 10 animals for group) :<br><br>
A)	Control groups:<br>
1° group: treatment:  only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v of carboxymethylcellulose, dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered by os, or a physiologic solution when parenterally administered, i.e. by subcutaneous , intraperitoneal, intravenous or intermuscular route) ,<br>
2° group: treatment: carrier as above defined + NEM,<br>
B)	Groups treated with the drug:<br>
group I:  treatment: carrier + drug,<br>
gruppo II: treatment: carrier + drug + NEM.<br>
The administration routes are those known for the drug, and can be the oral or subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous or intramuscular route.<br>
The NEM dose is of 25 mg/kg in physiologic solution (sub cutaneous route) and the drug is administered one hour later, in suspension in the carrier, as a single dose which corresponds to the maximum one, or the highest still tolerated by the animals of the group of rats not pretreated with NEM, i.e. the highest administrable dose to said group at which there is no manifest toxicity in the animals, defined as a toxicity that is clearly recognizable for its symptoms. The animals are sacrificed after 24 hours and then one proceeds to the evaluation of the damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.<br>
The drug meets test 1, i.e. it can be used to prepare the compoxinds of general formula (I) and (II), when the group of<br><br>
rats treated with NEM + carrier + drug shows gastrointestinal damages, or in said group the gastrointestinal damages noticed are greater than those shown by the group treated with the carrier alone, or the group treated with carrier + drug, or the group treated with carrier + NEM, even though the drug pharmacotherapeutic efficacy, assayed by using specific tests, is not significantly reduced.<br>
Test 2 (CIP): Protection parameter of endothelial cell against the oxidative stress induced by cumene hydroperoxide (CIP).<br>
Human endothelial cells of the umbilical vein are prepared according to an usual standard procedure. Fresh lombilical veins are filled with a 0.1% by weight collagenase solution and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes.<br>
Afterwards the veins are perfused with medium M 199 (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) pH 7.4 further added of other sub-staxices, as described in the examples. The cells are collected from the perfusate by'centrifugation and harvested in culture flasks T-75, pretreated with human fibronectin. The cells are then harvested in the same medium, further added with 10 ng/ml of bovine hypothalamic growth factor. When the cells of the primary cell culture (i.e. that directly obtained from ex-vivo) form a single layer of confluent cells (about 8,000,000 cells/flask) , the culture is stopped and the layers washed and trypsinized- The cellular suspensions are transferred into the<br><br>
wells of a cell culture plate having 24 wells, half of which i,s then additioned with the same culture medium containing the drug at a 10'M concentration, and harvested in a thermostat a-t; 37°C at a constant moisture. Only the cells coming from said first sub-cultures are used for the experiments with cumene hydroperoxide (CIP). The cells are identified as endothelial cells by morphological examination and by their specific immunological reaction towards factor VIII; said cultures did not show any contaminations from myocytes or fibroblasts.<br>
Before starting the test, the cellular culture medium is removed and the cellular layers are carefully washed with a physiologic solution at a temperature of 37°C. The wells of the culture plate are then incubated for one hour with CIP at a 5 mM concentration in the culture medium. The evaluation of cellular damage (apoptosis) is carried out by determining the per cent variation of the DNA fragmentation with respect to the control group (treated with CIP alone), evaluating the fluorescence variation at the wave length of 405-450 nm. 5 replicates for each sample are carried out.<br>
The drug meets the test, i.e. it can be used for preparing the compounds of general formula (I) and (II), when a statisti¬cally significant inhibition of apoptosis (cellular damage) induced by CIP with respect to the group treated with CIP alone is not obtained at p 
Test 3 (L-NAME): evaluation of the endothelial dysfunction<br><br>
induced by administration of L-NAME (N'-nitro'L-arginine-methyl ester) J. Clin. Investigation 90, 278-281,1992,<br>
The endothelial dysfunction is evaluated by determining the damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa, the hepatic damage and blood hypertension induced by administration of L-NAME.<br>
The animals (rats) are divided in groups as herein below shown. The group receiving L-NAME is treated for 4 weeks with said compound dissolved at a concentration of 400 mg/l'itre in drinking water. The following groups are constituted (No. 10 animals for group):<br>
A)	Control groups:<br>
1° group: only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v of carboxy-methylcellulose, dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered by os, phisiologic solution when administered parenterally) ,<br>
2°  group: carrier +  L-NAME,<br>
B)	Groups administered with the drug:<br>
3° group: carrier -i- drug,<br>
4° group: carrier +  drug -i- L-NAME.<br>
The administration routes are those known for the drug, and can be the oral or subcutaneous, intraperiteneal, intravenous or intramuscular route. The drug is administered at that dose which results the highest still tolerated by the animals of the group of rats not pretreated with L-NAME, i.e. the highest administrable dose at which there<br><br>
is no evident toxicity in the animals,' i.e a toxicitv recognizable for its symptoms. The drug is administered once a day for 4 weeks.<br>
At the end of the four weeks treatment access to water is prevented and after 24 hours the animals are sacrificed.<br>
One hour before the sacrifice blood-pressure is determined, and a blood pressure increase is taken as an evaluation of the damage to vascular endothelium. The damage to the gastric mucosa is evaluated as illustrated in test 1 (see example Fl). The hepatic damage is determined by evaluation of the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT increase) after sacrifice.<br>
The drug meets test 3, i.e. it can be used for preparing the compounds of general formula (I) and (II), when in the group of rats treated with L-NAME + drug + carrier it is found an higher hepatic damage (GPT) and/or an higher gastric damage cind/or an higher cardiovascular (blood-pressure) damage in comparison to that of the group treated with the carrier alone, or of the group treated with carrier + drug, or of the group treated with carrier + L-NAME; even if the drug pharmaco-therapeutic efficacy, assayed by specific tests, is not significantly reduced.<br>
Under the conditions indicated in the above described in vivo tests 1 and 3 the therapeutic index of the drug is reduced since the usual doses at which the drug can be effective are no<br><br>
longer  tolerated.<br>
Test 4 is a colorimetric test which affords to establish whether the precursor of B or B (precursor of the X2 or X2a of the formulas (I) and (II) respectively), inhibits the production of radicals from DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-l-picryl-hyd-razyl) (M.S. Nenseter et Al. , Atheroscler. Thromb. '15, 1338-1344, 1995). 100 uM solutions in methanol of the tested sub¬stances are prepared, and an aliquot of each of said solutions is added to a DPPH solution in methanol 0.1 M. After having stored the solutions at room temperature away from light for 30 minutes, their absorbances are read at the wave length of 517 run, together with that of the corresponding DPPH solution at the scime concentration. The absorbance decrease with respect to that of the solution of DPPH at the same concentration of the test solutions is determined. The effectiveness of the tested compound in inhibiting formation of radicals by DPPH is expressed by the  following  formula:<br>
(1   -   As/Ac)XlOO wherein Ag and A are respectively the absorbance values of the solution containing the test compound together with DPPH and of the  solution  containing  only  DPPH.<br>
The B or B; precursor satisfies test 4 if their effectiveness in inhibiting radical production as above defined, is equal to or higher than 50% at the indicated concentration   (10' M) .<br><br>
Unexpectedly th products of the invention of the formulas<br>
(I)	and (II) in oxidative stress conditions have an improved<br>
therapeutic index compared with the precursor drugs.<br>
For illustrative purposes the above mentioned tests are referred to the following compounds (see the Examples): Test 1: precursor drug: indomethacin<br>
Maximum administrable dose to rats: 7.5 mg/Kg p.o. By-administering a higher dose a toxicity is manifested, characterized by enteropathy, tremor, sedation until death (within 24 hours).<br>
The group of rats treated with NEM + indomethacin at the<br>
above mentioned dose shows gastrointestinal damages.<br>
Since indomethacin in the groups treated with NEM causes<br>
gastrointestinal damages, it meets test 1. Indomethacin can<br>
therefore be used as a drug for preparing the compounds (I) and<br>
(II)	of the present invention.<br>
Test 2: precursor drugs: indomethacin, paracetamol and mesala-mine<br>
Indomethacin and paracetamol meet test 2 since the cellular damage (apoptosis) inhibition induced by CIP is not significantly different with respect to that of the controls.<br>
Therefore the above drugs can be used as drugs for preparing the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention.<br>
On the contrary mesalamine does not meet test 2, since it inhibits the apoptosis induced by CIP. Therefore mesalamine<br><br>
according to test 2 could not be used as a precursor to prepare the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention. It has been however found that mesaiamine submitted to test 1 causes gastrointestinal damages.<br>
Thus also mesaiamine can be used as a precursor for preparing the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention. Test 3 (L-NAME) precursor drugs: paracetsonol, simvastatin, omeprazole<br>
Paracetamol and simvastatin meet test 3 since they cause gastric and hepatic damages greater than those induced both by L-NAME + carrier and by the drug + carrier.<br>
Therefore they can be used as precursors to prepare the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention.<br>
On the contrary it has been found that omeprazole neither causes gastric nor hepatic damages, nor influences blood-pressure. According to test 3 omeprazole could not be used as a precursor for preparing the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention.<br>
Test 4 (test for the precursor of B and B used as bivalent linking bridge): precursor N-acetylcysteine<br>
N-acetylcysteine inhibits of 100% the production of radicals induced by DPPH, therefore it meets test 4. Therefore it can be used as precursor of B or B,.<br>
In formula (III) Y is preferably selected from the following:<br><br><br>
The most preferred of Y- is Y12 (pyridyl) substituted in positions 2 and 6. The bonds can also be in asyrnmetric posi¬tion, for exair.ple Y12 (pyridyl) can be substituted also in position 2 and 2; Yl (pyrazcl) —.ay be 3,5-disubstituted.<br>
The compounds according tc the present invention of for¬mula (I) and (II) can be transformed into the corresponding salts. For exarr.ple one route tc fcrri the salts is the follo¬wing: when in the molecule one nicrogen atom sufficiently basic to be salified, in organic solvent such as for example acetonitrile, tetrahydrofurar., is present, it is reacted with an eguimolecular amount of the corresponding organic or inor¬ganic acid. To form the salt, preferably in the fonriula of the invention compounds Y or Y' of formula (III) is present.<br>
Examples of organic acids are: oxalic, tartaric, maleic, succinic, citric acids.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are: nitric, hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric acids.<br>
The derivatives according to the invention can be used in the therapeutic indications of the precursor drug, allowing to obtain the advantages exemplified hereinafter for some groups<br><br>
Df these drugs:<br>
Anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs: the invention compounds result very well tolerated and effective, even when the organism is debilitated and is under conditions of oxidative stress. Said drugs can be used also in those pathologies wherein inflammation plays a s'ignificant pathogenetic role, such as for instance, but not limited to, in cancer, asthma, miocardic infarction. Adrenergic blockers, of or- or /3-blocker type: the action spectrum of the compounds of formula (I) and (II) results wider than that of the starting drugs; to a direct action on the smooth musculature the inhibition of the nervous beta-adrenergic signals governing the contraction of the hematic vessels is associated. The side effects (dyspnoea, bronchoconstriction) affecting the respiratory apparatus are lower.<br>
Antithrombotic drugs: the antiplatelet activity is potentiated and in the case of the aspirin derivatives the gastric tolerability is improved.<br>
Bronchodilators and drugs active on the cholinergic system: the side effects affecting the cardio-vascular apparatus (tachycardia, hypertension) result lowered. Expectorants and mucolytic drugs: the gastrointestinal tolerability results improved. Diphosphonates: the toxicity relating to the gastrointe-<br><br>
stinal tract is drastically lowered.<br>
Phosphodiesterase (PDE) (bronchodilators) inhibitors: the<br>
therapeutic efficacy is improved, the dosage being equal;<br>
it is therefore possible, using the compounds of the<br>
invention to administer a lower dose of the drug and<br>
reduce the side effects.<br>
Anti leukotrienic drugs: better efficacy.<br>
ACE inhibitors: better therapeutic efficacy and lower side<br>
effects  (dyspnoea,  cough)  affecting the  respiratory<br>
apparatus.<br>
Antidiabetic   drugs    (insulin-sensitizing   and<br>
hypoglycaemizing)  antibiotic,  antiviral,  antitumoral,<br>
ajiticolitic drugs, drugs for the dementia therapy: better<br>
efficacy and/or tolerability.<br>

The above mentioned substances, precursor drugs, are prepared according to the methods known in the prior art. See for example in "The Merck Index, 12a Ed. (1996), herein in¬corporated by reference. When available, the corresponding isomers, comprising optical isomers, can be used.<br>
Tomoxiprol is obtained according to the method describeid in EP 12,866.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (II) are prepared with synthesis methods mentioned below.<br>
The choice of the reactions for each method depends on the reactive groups present in the precursor drug molecule, in the precursor compound of B or B,, which can be, as above men¬tioned, bivalent or monovalent, ajid in the precursor compound of C.<br>
The reactions are carried out with methods well known in the prior art, which allow to obtain bonds among the precursor<br><br>
drug, the precursor drug of E or B-_ and the precursor compound<br>
of C as above defined.<br>
When the reactive function of the precursor drug (for<br>
example -COOH, -OH) is involved in a covalent bond, for example<br>
of ester, amide, ether type, said function can be restored with<br>
the methods well known in the prior art.<br>
Some synthesis scherr;es for obtaining the compounds of the<br>
invention are reported hereinafter:<br>
A) Synthesis of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
1. Synthesis of uhe compound obtained by reaction between the precursor drug and zhe  compound precursor of B.<br>
ik. When the drug has general formula R-COOH and the functio¬nal group of the precursor compound of B which binds itself to the drug carboxylic function has the formula XZ, X being as above defined and Z = H, the reactions which take place depend on the nature of the second reactive group present in the precursor compound of B.<br>
la.l When the second reactive group present in the precursor compound of B is a carboxylic group, the synthesis general scheme expects the initial formation of the halide of the R-COHal acid (Hal = CI, Br) and the subsequent reaction with the HX group of the precursor compound of B:<br>
RCOOH	RCOHal + H-X-X2-COOH	<br>
R-T,-T3-X2-COOH      (lA . 1) X2, TT, T3 being as above defined.<br><br>
When in the two reaction compounds other functional groups COOH and/or HX are present, they must be protected before the reaction according to the methods known in the art; for example as described -in the volume by Th. W. Greene: "Protective groups in organic synthesis", Harward Univer¬sity Press,   1980.<br>
The RCOHal acylhalide is prepared according to th.e methods known in the prior art, for example by thionyl or 'oxalyl chloride, p-- or P halides in inert solvents under the reaction conditions, such as for example toluene, chloro¬form,   DMF,   etc.<br>
Specifically, if the HX group of the precursor compound of B is NH2, or OH or SH, the precursor drug of formula R-COOH is first converted into the corresponding acyl halide RCOHal, as above mentioned, and then reacted with the HX group of the precursor compound of B in the presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, etc. using cin inert solvent in the reaction conditions such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran, etc. at a temperature in the range OOC-25°C.<br>
Alternatively to the previous synthesis, the precursor drug of formula R-COOH can be treated with an agent act¬ivating the carboxyl group selected from N,N' -carbonyldii-midazol (GDI), N-hydroxybenzotriazol and dicyclohexylcar-bodiimide in solvent  such as   for  example DMF,   THF,   chlo-<br><br>
roform etc. at a temperature in the range -5°C-5Q°C and the obtained commpound reacted in situ with the reactive function of the precursor ccrnpound of B for obtaining the compound of formula (lA.l). la. 2 When the precursor compound of B contains two functional groups XZ , equal to or different from each other, X being as above defined and Z = K, the precursor drug having for¬mula R-COOH is first treated with an agent activating the carboxyl group, as above described in la.l, and then with the precursor compound of B, after having protected one of the two reactive HX groups, for exsonple with acetyl or ter-butyloxycarbonyl, restoring the initial function at the synthesis end. The scheme is the following:<br>
GDI, HX-X2-X-G<br>
RCOOH 	-     R-T-T3-X2-X-G	-<br>
	   R-T1-T3-X2-XH (IA.2)<br>
wherein X, T, Tg, X2 are as above defined and G is a protective group of- the HX function.<br>
2.  Nitroxyderivative synthesis.<br>
2a. 1 When the compound obtained at the end of the previous step<br>
la. has formula (lA.l), the acid can be converted into the<br>
corresponding sodic salt and then one can follow the known<br>
prior art methods for preparing the final compound, for<br>
example according to one of the following synthesis<br>
schemes:<br>

wherein T, T3, X2, Tgj, T- are as above defined, R4 is se¬lected from CI, Br, Y is as above defined, X is the Y radical free from the oxygen atom, R3 is CI, Br, Iodine, OH. If R3 = OH the compound of formula (lA.lb) is subje¬cted to halogenation, for example *7ith PBrj, PCI5, SOCI2/ PPh3 + I2, and then reacted with AgN03 in organic solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran.

Acute toxicity has been evaluated by administering to a group of 10 rats weighing 20 g a single dose of each of the tested compounds, by cannula, by os in an aqueous suspension of carboxymethylcellulose 2% w/v.<br><br>
The animals are kept under observation for 14 days. In no animal of the group toxic symptoms appeared, even after administration of a 100 mg/Kg dose. EXAMPLE Fl<br>
Test 1 - experimental model in vivo with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM): study of the gastric tolerability of some drugs screened as precursors of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The animals (rats, weight about 200 g) are distributed in the following groups (No. 10 animals for group):<br>
A)	Control groups:<br>
1° group: treatment: only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v of carboxymethylcellulose, dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered by os, physiologic solution when by parenteral route),<br>
2°  group: treatment: carrier + NEM,<br>
B)	Groups administered with each drug:<br>
group I:  treatment: carrier + drug,<br>
group II: treatment: carrier + drug + NEM.<br>
The drugs assayed in this experiment are the following (Taible I): indomethacin, ambroxol, mesalamine, sodic alendro¬nate, tacrine, omeprazol, misoprostol.<br>
Indomethacin, ambroxol and alendronate are administered by OS, mesalamine by intracolonic (rectal) route and tacrine, ome¬prazol, misoprostol by subcutaneous route.<br>
The maximum tolerated dose, determined by administering<br><br>
ach substance by the above said routes to the animals not reated with NEM, is reported in Table I. With higher doses ,han those reported in the Table, enteropathy, diarrhoea, repression, tremor and sedation have appeared in the animals.<br>
In this experimental model the animals are at first<br>
created with NEM by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 25<br>
g/kg in physiologic solution. The drug is administered one<br>
our later, in suspension in the carrier. Animals are sacrifi-<br>
:ed after 24 hours and evaluation of the damage to the<br>
gastrointestinal mucosa is made by CQUJjting the niunber of rats,<br>
inside each group, with lesion     the stomach at a visual<br>
inspection. The total number of said rats is then divided by<br>
the total number of rats of the-trroup and multiplied by 100.<br>
The thus obtained percentages are reidrted in Table I. The<br>
Table shows that in the groups of rats treated with said drugs<br>
without NEM, no gastric lesions were detectable<br>
All the rats of group II (treated with NEMshowed gastric lesions after administration with thefollowing drugs: indo-methacin, ambroxol, mesalamine, sodic alendronate, tacrine. Said drugs therefore can be used in the synthesis of the products of the invention.<br>
• Omeprazol and misoprostol cannot instead be used, on the basis of the results provided in test 1, for preparing the products of the invention.<br><br>

prazol have been tested.<br>
Human endothelial cells of the umbilical vein are prepared according to a standard method. Fresh umbilical veins are filled with a collagenase sollition 0.1% by weight and incubated at 37°C for 5 minuted.<br>
Subsequently the veins are perfused with the medium M 199 (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) pH 7.4 with 0.1% (weight/volume) of collagenase, added with 10% of bovine fetus sernm (10 mcg/inl), sodium heparin (50 mcg/ml), thimidine (2.4 mcg/ml), glutamine (230 mcg/ml), penicillin (100 Ul/ml), streptomycin (100 mcg/ml) and streptomycin (0.125 mcg/ml). The cells are collected from the- perfusate centrifugation at 800 rpm cind harvested in culture flasks-T-75, pretreated with human fibronectin. Cells are then harvested in the same medium, added with bovine hypothalamic growth factor (100 ng/ml). When the cells of the primary cell culture (the cells directly removed from ex-vivo umbilical vein) form a single layer of<br><br>
confluent cells (abdut 8,000,000 cells/flask), har-vesting is stopped and the layers are washed and trypsinized. The cellular suspensions are transferred into wells of a culture plate having 24 wells, half of said wells being added with the same culture mediiam containing the drug at a 10"*M concentration, cind harvested in a thermostat at 37°C at a constant moisture (90%), CO2 = 5%. When the drug is not soluble in the culture medium, it is formerly dissolved in a small amount of di-methylsulphoxide. The maximum amount of dimethyl sulphoxide which can be added to the culture medium is 0.5%. Only the cells coming from these first sutjcultures are used for the tests with ciimene hydroperoxide (CIP) . The cells are identified as endothelial cells by morphological Jexamination and by the specific immunological reaction towds factor VIII; these cultures did never show contaminations i-xpm myocytes or fibroblasts.<br>
Before starting the test, ■rie cellular cuure medium is removed emd the cellular layeifs are carefully washed with a standard physiologic solution bifered jjiafth phosphate 0.1 M pH 7.0, at the temperature of 37°C. The content of each well is then incubated for one hour with a CIP suspension in the culture medium at a 5 mM concentration. Evaluation of the cellular damage (apoptosis) is carried out by determining the per cent variation of the DNA fragmentation in the cultures containing the drug + CIP with respect to the controls treated<br><br>
with CIP only. Said % variation of DNA fragmentation is determined by evaluating the fluorescence variation by a BX60 Olympus microscope (Olympus Co., Roma) set at the wave length of 405-450 nm, of the test samples with respect to the optical density of the controls. The fluorescence of each sample was determined on 5 replicates. Statistic evaluation has been made with t Student test (p 
Results are given in Table II and show that indomethacin, paracetamol, clopidogrel, salbutamol, sodic alendronate, diphylline, cetirizine, enalapril, yn'i'otinamide, ampicilline, aciclovir, tacrine, omeprazol o not significantly inhibit apoptosis; these drugs can therefore b-ed for preparing the products of the invention.<br>
On the contrary eimbroxol, mesalamine and simvastatine inhibit apoptosis. Therefore on the basis of the results of test 2 these compounds could not be used for preparing the pro¬ducts of the invention. EXAMPLE F3<br>
Test 3 - experimental in vivo mcel with N-nitXo-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME): gastric tdlerability(gastrointestinal damage incidence), hepatic (GPT dosage, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) ajid cardiovascular (blood pressure) tolerability of some drugs screened as precursors of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The experimental model adopted is according to J. Clin.<br><br>
Investigation 90, 278'-281,1992 .<br>
The endothelial dysfunction is evaluated by determining the damage induced by L-NAME administration to the gastrointestinal mucosa, the hepacic damage (GPT increase), and the vascular endotheliiom or cardiovascular damage as blood hypertension.<br>
The animals (rats, average weight 200 g) are divided in groups as herein below described. The group receiving L-NAME is treated for 4 weeks with said compound dissolved at the concentration of 400 mg/litre in drinking water. The following groups (No. 10 animals fq3?''grc:up) are constituted:<br>
A)	Control groups:<br>
1° group: treatment: only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v of carboxymethylcellulos, dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered by QS , physiologic solution when by parenteral route) ,<br>
2° group: treatment: carrier + L-NAME,<br>
B)	Groups treated with the drug:<br>
3° group: treatment: carrier + drug,<br>
4° group: treatment: carrier +  drug -i- L-NAME.<br>
The drugs used in the test are pa.racetamol, doxorubicine, simvastatine, omeprazol and misoprostol. Each drug is administered once a day for 4 weeks.<br>
The maximum tolerated dose of the drug being administered to the animals is determined by evaluating, in a separate dose<br><br>
scaling up experiment on untreated animals, the appearance in tae animals of symptoms such as enteropathy, diarrhoea, depression, tremor, sedation.<br>
At the end of the four weeks access to water is prevented and after 24 hours the animals are sacrificed.<br>
One hour before the sacrifice blood pressure is determined and a blood pressure increase is taken as an indication of a damage being occurred to vascular endothelixim.<br>
The damage to the gastric mucosa is evaluated as pre¬viously mentioned in test 1 (ex. Fl). The hepatic damage is determined by evaluation after ,.tJe sacrifice of the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT incrse) .<br>
The drug meets test 3 and ij;:. therefore be used for preparing the compounds of the invention, when in the group of rats treated with L-NAME + drug + carrier, an higher hepatic damage (higher GPT values) and/of higher gastric damage and/or higher cardiovascular dainage (higher blood pessure) are found in comparison with the group treated with the carrier only, or the group treated with carrier + drug, or tl&gt;4 group treated with carrier + L-NAME.<br>
The test results are reported in Table IV. The % gastric lesions have been determined as in Test 1. The % GPT and % blood pressure values are referred to the corresponding value found in the animals of the 1st group of the control groups. The average value of the blood pressure in this group was of<br><br>
LOS + 8 inmHg.<br>
The results obtained shcv; that paracetamol, doxorubicin ind simvastatins cause hepatic damage and gastroenteropathy (GPT values and the gastric lesions are % higher compared both ffith the corresponding groups treated with the drug, in the absence of L-NAME, and with the controls treated with L-NAME) .<br>
These drugs can therefore be used for preparing the products of the invention.<br>
Omeprazol and misoprostol should not instead be used, on the basis of this test, for preparing the products of the invention. EXAMPLE F4<br>
Test 4: inhibition of the radical production from DPPH of some substances to be used as precursors of B or Bl (ref. Formulas I and II of the invention)<br>
The method is based on a colorimetric test in which DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-l-picryl-hydra3yl) is used as the compound-forming radicals (M.S. Nenseter et Al., Atheroscler. Thromb. 15, 1338-1344, 1995).<br>
Solutions in methanol of the tested substances at a final concentration 100 \M are initially prepared. 0.1 ml of each of these solutions are added to aliquots of 1 ml of a methanol solution 0.1 M of DPPH and then the final volume is brought to 1.5 ml. After having stored the solutions at room temperature away from light for 30 minutes, the absorbance at the wave<br><br>
length of 517 run is read. It is determined the absorbance decrease with respect to the absorbance of a solution containing the same concentration of DPPH.<br>
The efficacy of the test compound to inhibit the production of radicals, or antiradical activity, is expressed by the following formula:<br>
(1 - As/Ac)X100 wherein Ag and A, are, respectively, the absorbance values of the solution containing the test compound together + DPPH and of the solution containing only DPPH.<br>
The compound meets test 4 if radical production inhibition, as above defined, is equal to or higher than 50%.<br>
In Table V the results obtained with the following sub¬stances are reported: N-acetylcisteine, cisteine, ferulic acid, (L)-camosine, gentisic acid.<br>
Table V shows that N-acetylcisteine, cisteine, ferulic acid, (L)-camosine, gentisic acid meet test 4 since they inhibit the production of  radicals formed from DPPH by more than 50%. EXAMPLE F5<br>
Antiinflammatory activity and gastric tolerability of the compoxonds according to the invention in comparison with the corresponding precursor drugs in conditions of endothelial dysfunction induced by L-NAME (N'-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester)<br><br>
The experimental model of Edwards et Al., J. Pathol. 134, 147-156, 1981 was followed.<br>
Groups formed by 10 rats, having an average weigh of 200 g, have been constituted. The groups have been treated with L-NAME dissolved in drinking water (400 mg/1) for two weeks, except one group which constituted the control group.<br>
The drugs were administered by os, at the dose of 10 mg/Kg, in carrier carboxymethylcellulose 1% in water, 5 ml/Kg.<br>
Thus the groups, except the below described control groups, were treated with the drug + L-MAME + carrier.<br>
The following control groups were formed: 1° control group: treatment: carrier. 2°   control group: treatment: carrier + L-NAME.<br>
The drugs used in the experiment are the following: di¬clofenac and the corresponding thioester with (4-nitroxy)bu-tyryl penicillamine (Ex. 26), piroxicam and the corresponding ester with the p-(4-nitroxy)butyryloxy-f erulic acid (Ex. 25), the acetylsalicylic acid and the corresponding thioester with N-acetyl-(4-nitroxy)butyrylcisteine (Ex. 24).<br>
After two weeks from the beginning of the experiment the cinimals were subjected to three consecutive injections of air by subcutaneous route, in the dorsal part of the animal, according to the following procedure:<br>
first injection: 20 ml,<br>
after three days from the first injection: 10 ml.<br><br>
after 6 days'from the first injecticr.: the same amount of<br>
10 ml. The animals were then fasted -.mtil the following morning. One hour before the percutaneous injection v/ich carragenine (2 ml of a 1% carragenine solu-ion in water) in the inflammatory exudate, the treated animals received by os the carrier or one of the tested compounds dissolved or suspended in the carrier. The animals were sacrificed af-er 6 hours from the injection of the carragenine solution. The inflammatory exudate was collected and measured to evaluate the leucccyte infiltration.<br>
In Table VI the antiinf lammiatory activity is expressed as % inhibition of the leucocyte infiltration with respect to the leucocyte infiltration value found in the animals treated with the carrier and pretreated wich L-NAME, the % inhibition of the gastrointestinal damage was evaluated as previously described in Test 1 (ex. 1), and the % blood pressure was evaluated one hour before the sacrifice and referred uo that of the 1st control group (treatment: carrier). In this group of animals ■the average pressure value was of 108 + 10 mmHg.<br>
Table VI shows that the compounds of the invention are as active as the corresponding precursors in the antiinflammatory activity test, but in the confront of the latter they reduce the damage to the cardiovascular endothelium (lower % increase of blood pressure with respect to that of the corresponding precursor), cind besides reduce, or do not give at all, gastric<br><br>
damage. EXAMPLE F6<br>
In a second apoptosis experimenL; indomechacin and the indcraethacin thioester with N-acecyl-(4-n.itroxy)butyryl cisteine (Ex. 3) according co the present invention were compared. The results are reported in Table III, and show that: the compound of z'ne invention inhibits, differently from the precursor, t:he apoptosis induced by cumene hydroperoxide (CIP). EXAMPLE F7<br>
Gastric tolerability of some drugs used as precursors and of the corresponding com.pounds according to the invention.<br>
The test for gastrointestinal damage of Example F5 was repeated but omitting the pretreatment of animals with L-NAME. The tested drugs, thereof administered doses and results are reported in Table VII. From the Table it is drawn that gastropathy incidence is much lower in the groups treated with the compounds of the invention in the confront of the groups treated with the corresponding precursors.<br><br>

Example Fl was repeated with four groups of rats (each group of of ten animals), all of them receiving NEM, and orally-administered as it follows :<br>
a.	control group : the vehicle formed of an aqueous<br>
suspension 1% w/v of carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
b.	one group (group b - comparative ) administered at the<br>
same time with 5 mg/Kg (0.014 mmoles/Kg) of indomethacin<br>
+ 2.3 mg/Kg (0.014 mmoles/Kg) of N-acetylcysteine in the<br>
same above vehicle,<br>
c.	one group (group c - comparative) administered at the same<br>
time with 6.6 mg/Kg (0.014 mmoles/Kg) of indomethacin 4-<br>
(nitroxy)butyl ester, synthetized according to the method<br>
disclosed in WO 95/09831, +2.3 mg/Kg (0.014 mmoles/Kg) of<br>
N-acetylcysteine in the same above vehicle,<br>
d.	one group (group d) administered with 8,7 mg/Kg (0.014<br>
mmoles/Kg) of the indomethacin thioester with N-acetyl- (4-<br>
nitroxy)butyryl cisteine (ref. Ex. 3), in the above same<br>
vehicle.<br>
The results are reported in Table VIII and show that the mixtures administered respectively to groups b and c (comparatives), differently from the compound of the invention administered to group d, were almost ineffective (group b) or much less effective (group c) in reducing gastric lesions.<br><br>
