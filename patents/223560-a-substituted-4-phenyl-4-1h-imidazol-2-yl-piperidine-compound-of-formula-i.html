				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to novel 4-phenyl-4-[l#-imidazol-2-yl]-piperidine derivatives, processes for their preparation and their use in medicine, in particular as selective non-peptide d-opioid agonists.<br>
The presence of at least three populations of opioid receptors (commonly known as mu (p.), delta (d) and kappa (K) receptors) is now well established and documented and all three populations appeal- to be present in the central and peripheral nervous system of many species, including man (Lord J.A.H. et al., Nature 1977, 267, 495).<br>
Modulation of one or more of these opioid receptor subtypes may lead to a variety of effects observed in animal models, giving rise to unique pharmacological profiles for each receptor. For instance, d-agonists seem to exert an analgesic effect (both spinal and supraspinal) in different pain conditions in mice, rats, rodents, primates and even in man (Moulin et al. Pain, 1985, 23, 213), increase the release of growth hormone and inhibit dopamine release, while d-antagonists have no analgesic effect and decrease the release of growth hormone. (Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1996, 525).<br>
Some experiments also suggest that d-analgesics may also lack the usual side effects associated with Âµ.- and K-receptor activation (Galligan et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1984, 229. 641).<br>
Animal models have also demonstrated that d-opioid receptor agonists may exert a direct effect on the gastrointestinal (e.g. antidiarrhoeal effect) and respiratory tract (e.g. stimulatory effect on respiratory activity). Furthermore, it has been shown that d-opioid receptor agonists may play a synergistic role in a variety of pharmacological<br><br><br>
effects. In fact, they positively modulate the central antinociception and antitussive activity of ^-agonists, resulting in a diminished dose regimen delaying the untoward side-effects associated to these narcotic drugs. Interestingly, the immunostimulatory activity of some d-opioid receptor agonists may be of value in the development of therapeutic strategies for immune deficient disorders in man (Dondio et al. Review : Non-peptide .d-opipid. agonists and antagonists, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 1997, IQ, 1075).<br>
In view of their important pharmacological value, there is a need for d-opioid receptor agonists that are selective both in their action as agonists (showing weak or no antagonist action) and for the d-receptor (showing weak or no preference for the n- or K-opioid receptor subtype). Furthermore, such d-opioid receptor agonists should not be peptidic in nature as such compounds are unstable for administration by systemic routes.<br>
Currently known non-peptidic delta opioid receptor agonists comprise indolo- and benzofuranomorphinans (US-5354863 (1994) by Searle &amp; Co, WO-9531464 (1995) by Astra AB), octahydroisoquinolines (e.g. TAN-67 by Toray Inc., published in JP-4275288 (1992) and WO-9710216 (1997) by Smithkline Beecham SPA), piperazine derivatives (e.g. BW373U86 and SNC 80 by The Welcome Foundation, published in WO-9315062 (1993)), pyrrolooctahydroisoquinolines (WO-9504734 (1995) by Smithkline Beecham SPA), ethylamine derivatives (WO-9622276 (1996) by Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd.), triazaspirodecanones (WO 0146192 (2001) by Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd.) and substituted amino-derivatives (EP-864559 (1998) by Gruenenthal Gmbh).<br>
WO-9828270 (1998) and WO-9828275 (1998) by Astra AB discloses piperidine-derivatives with analgesic activity. Said compounds are not structurally related to the compounds of the present invention.<br>
EP 1 038 872 Al(2000) by Pfizer Products Inc. disclose certain 4-phenyl-4-heteroarylpiperidine derivatives as opioid receptor ligands. Said compounds differ<br><br>
structurally from the ones in the current application - among other - in nature of the piperdinyl nitrogen substitution, which lacks the bivalent rc-bond radical substitution.<br>
In WO 00/37470 (2000) by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. is generally disclosed a pathway for the synthesis of antihistaminic spiro-compounds using some compounds according to the invention. However, said compounds have not exemplified in the prior art application, nor is there any suggestion that they might have d-opioid receptor agonists properties.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a novel class of highly selective d-opioid receptor agonists, based on a piperidine-moiety It is another object of the present invention to provide d-opioid receptor agonists useful as analgesics having reduced side-effects. It is the further object of the present invention to provide d-opioid receptor agonists active for d-opioid receptor mediated diseases.<br>

The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds according to Formula (I) are able to form. Said acid addition salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aininosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic base addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, hi particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, ^-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said acid or base addition salt forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates which the compounds according to Formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br><br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used herein defines all possible isomeric forms which the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R* ] or [R*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and |7?*,-/?*] indicates centers with the same chirality and [.ft*,.!?*] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R* S*]. If "a" and "/3" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "/3", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
We note that the substituted carbon atom in the 4-position in the piperidinyl moiety is an achiral atom; therefore, compounds of Formula (I) may only have at least one stereogenic center in their structure by virtue of a chiral substituent R1, R2, R3, R4 or R5.<br><br>
The tautomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (I) wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into aketo group (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
The N-oxide forms of the compounds according to Formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called JV-oxide, particularly those JV-oxides wherein the nitrogen of the piperidine moiety and/or the imidazole moiety is oxidized.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) as prepared in the processes described below may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further<br><br>
discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Deliveiy Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985,29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof and the W-oxide forms thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COOR*, where Rx is a Chalky!, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups:<br>
(Figure Remove) Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H, l, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, Ci-ealkyl, phenyl or benzyl.<br>
Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly been shown to be useful in therapy, especially for the treatment of various pain conditions, such as and in particular centrally mediated pain, peripherally mediated pain, structural or soft tissue injury related pain, progressive disease related pain, neuropathic pain and acute pain such as caused by acute injury, trauma or surgery and chronic pain such as caused by neuropathic conditions, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, post-stroke pain syndromes and cluster or migraine headeaches.<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be useful for the treatment of arthritis, psoriasis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, respiratory function disorder, functional diarrhea, non-ulcerogenic dyspepsia and incontinence. Such use has also been documented in WO/9852929 (Pfizer Ltd, 1998).<br>
The presence of delta opioid receptors on the human colon has also been demonstrated by both radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies. The greatest density of binding (80-90 %) has been located to the neurones of the myenteric plexus situated between the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layers, with a low density of receptors located on the smooth muscle layers. In functional studies, delta-opioid agonists can inhibit both cholinergic and non-cholinergic excitatory neurotransmission in the human colon. Based on these observations, delta-opioid receptor agonists would be expected to inhibit colonic motility in man. It has also been shown that the peripherally acting selective delta-opioid agonist UK-321130 exhibited potent, dose-related inhibition of colonic motility in pre-clinical models. Therefor, the compounds of the present invention are also claimed for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).<br>
The present invention thus relates to compounds of Formula (I) as defined hereinabove, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isorneric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof and the TV-oxide forms thereof, for use as a medicine.<br>
In vitro receptor and neurotransmitter signal transduction studies can be used to evaluate the delta, mu and kappa opioid receptor agonist activities, as described further in this application.<br>
The invention also relates to a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention.  The compounds according to the invention may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for<br><br>
systemically administering drugs.

Materials and methods<br>
Cell culture<br>
CHO cells, permanent transfected with the r or // opioid receptor, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Nutrient mixture Ham's F12 (ratio 1:1) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, and an antibiotic solution containing 100 lU/ml penicillin G, 100 //g/ml streptomycin sulfate, 110 //g/ml pyruvic acid and 300 //g/ml L-glutamine. C6 glioma cells, permanent transfected with the S opioid receptor, required a DMEM medium, enriched with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and the antibiotic solution as described above.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
The membranes were prepared as total particulate fractions. All cell lines were cultured to 90% confluency on 145 mm Petri dishes and treated with 5 mM sodium butyrate, 24 hours before collection. The culturing medium was removed and the cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+), scraped from the plates in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and collected through centrifugation (10 minutes at 16,000 RPM at 4Â°C). The cell pellet was re-suspended in hypotonic 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and re-homogenized with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18000 RPM for 20 minutes at 4Â°C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 and stored in aliquots at ~70Â°C. A protein determination was performed using the Biorad protein assay (Bradford) using bovine serum albumine (BSA) as a standard (Bradford, MM.: A rapid and sensitive method for the quantification ofmicrogram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding. Analytical Biochem. 72: 248-254, 1976).<br>
Radioligand binding<br>
Preliminary radioligand binding experiments were carried out to reveal the optimal assay conditions for these opioid receptor subtypes in their corresponding mammalian cell membranes.<br>
Competitive inhibition of [3H]DPDPE by the compounds was performed with a concentration of the radioligand of 2 nM (Kd = 1.7 nM) and various concentrations in singlet of the compounds, spanning at least 3 orders of magnitude around the pICso value. For competition binding.on the K and ja receptor, [3H]U69593 (Kd = 0.4 nM) and [3H]DAMOO (Kd = 0.6 nM) were used respectively at a concentration of 1 nM. Membranes were thawed on ice and diluted in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. For the 5 opioid receptor, this incubation buffer was supplemented with 2 mM MgCb, 1 mM EGTA and 0.1% BSA. Non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 1 uJM of naltrindole, spiradoline and dextromoramide for the 8, K, and p opioid receptor, respectively. An incubation of 1 hour at 25Â°C was found to be optimal for competition binding assays for all the three receptor subtypes. The assays were carried out in a final volume of 500 ul. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration over an UniFilterâ¢-96, GF/Bâ¢ under reduced pressure using Filter-mate 196 (Packard). The amount of bound radioactivity on the filter unit was determined after filter drying and scintillant addition (Microscint-O; Packard) by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
[35S]GTPyS binding<br>
Determination of [35S]GTPyS binding to the G-proteins was carried out with a modified procedure of Lazareno (Lazareno S.: Measurement ofagonist-stimulated^SJGTPyS binding to cell membranes. Meth. Molec. Biol. 106, 231-243,1999). In preliminary [35S]GTPyS binding experiments, assay conditions were optimized which resulted in the choice of the following buffers: 20 mM Hepes with 100 mM NaCl, containing 3 uM GDP and 1 mM MgCl2 for the u. opioid receptor CHO membranes, containing 10 uM GDP and 1 mM MgClj for the 5 opioid receptor C6 glioma cell membranes, and 10 pM GDP and 0.3 mM MgCl2 for the K opioid receptor CHO membranes . The assay mixtures contained 10 \i% of membrane protein. An additional 10 /j.g/ml saponine was added to the diluted membranes as a detergent to maximize the [35S]GTPyS penetration through the membranes.<br>
For testing agonistic activity, 175 ul of diluted membranes was pre-incubated in the buffer described above together with 25 pi of buffer and 25 ul of varying concentrations of the compound in a total volume of 225 uj. For antagonistic activities, the 25 ul of the buffer addition was replaced with the reference agonist for stimulating the basal levels. For all three cell lines, a concentration of 300 nM of DPDPE, U69593 and morphine were used for their corresponding receptor subtypes. After a 20 minutes pre-incubation period at 37Â°C, 25 ul of [35S]GTPyS was added to a final concentration of 0.25 nM and the assay mixtures were further incubated for 20 minutes at 37Â°C. Bound and free [35S]GTPyS were separated by rapid filtration over an UniFilterâ¢-96, GF/Bâ¢ under reduced pressure using Filtermate 196 (Packard). The amount of bound radioactivity on the filter unit was determined after filter drying and scintillant addition (Microscint-O; Packard) by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Basal [35S]GTPyS binding was measured in absence of compounds. Stimulation by agonist was calculated as the percentage increase above basal levels. The sigmoid agonist concentration response curves for increases in [35S]GTPyS binding and antagonist inhibition curves for inhibition of the reference agonist-stimulated [3SSJGTPyS binding were analyzed by non-linear regression using the GraphPad Prism program. Data were retrieved from independent experiments and the different concentration points were run hi duplicates.<br>
