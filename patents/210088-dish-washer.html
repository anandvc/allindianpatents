				<td>The dishwasher comprises a steel body with two cage-like stands, a false base and slits in its lower portion, placed inside another bigger steel body, with their bases joined together. The lower portion serves as a water tank. A water pump, with a pipe immersed in water connected to its inlet, and another pipe joined to a set of three pipes having small-small holes which run through these stands, connected to its outlet, is mounted on a stand with wheels. This stand is connected to a slow moving motor which can rotate in both the directions. And, as it rotates, the stand also moves from left to right and vice versa. Two scrubbers, motor driven, are positioned on the upper stand to scrub bigger cooking bowls. Used dishes are placed upside down on the stands. Initially, hot water mixed with cleaning liquid, gushes out of the pipes with small-small holes and falls on the inner and outer bodies of the dishes. The stand moves from left to right and vice versa repeatedly. After that, the process is repeated with plain cold water to rinse the dishes. This system uses less water and cleans the dishes in a hygienic manner in very less time.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to a dish-washer, a kitchen device for washing dishes mechanically. An application for a substantially same invention was earlier filed vide Application No.2826/DEL/98 dated 21.09.1998.<br>
The crude method of washing dishes is by hands which is not only time-consuming, but also needs a lot of water and is psychologically repulsive.i This dish-washer aims to minimize the housewife's daily chores. It is also the object of this invention to have a device which is very simple in construction, easy for operation and also available at an affordable price.<br>
Thus, according to this invention, a dish-washer for washing dishes mechanically comprises a steel body placed inside another bigger steel body, with their bases joined together. There are slits/cuts/holes in the lower portion of the smaller body so that water can move from the bigger body into smaller body and vice-versa. The smaller body has a false base to reduce the volume of the lower portion of this unit which serves as a water tank too. A water- pump, mounted on a stand with wheels, rests on top of the smaller body. This stand is connected through strings to a pulley on one side and the pulley of a slow moving motor on another side. This motor can rotate at very slow speed in both clock-wise and anti clock-wise directions. And, as it rotates, the stand also moves from left to right and from right to left. The inlet of the water pump is connected to a pipe which is immersed in the water tank below. The outlet of the water pump is connected to a pipe which is joined to a set of three pipes having a number of small-small holes. This pipe along with the set of three pipes enters the smaller steel body through a slit in its rear part. The smaller steel body has two cage-like stands for keeping dishes. The positioning of the three pipes having small-small holes is such that the upper stand has a pipe above and a pipe below it and the lower stand has a pipe beneath it. Beneath the upper stand are two shafts mounted on thrust bearings. Their upper ends rise a little above the stand and are attached to scrubbers. There are clamps fixed on this stand to hold the dishes, in which food has been cooked, firmly. The pulleys of these shafts are connected, through strings, to the pulley of a fast moving motor. Below the stands and just above the water tank is a very fine net/sieve to filter the water. Inlet and outlet pipes are connected to solenoid valves to fill and drain out water in the water tank respectively. A water heater, fitted with a thermostat, heats water in the tank to the desired<br>
temperature. The whole system is electrically connected to suitable timing devices.<br>
Now the invention will be more clearly described with reference to Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the drawings wherein Fig. 1 shows the layout diagram of the dish-washer, Figure 2 shows the stand with wheels, with water pump along with connected pipes mounted on it, in movement from left to right and from right to left, and Figure 3 shows the scrubber in action.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a steel body (1) is placed inside another bigger steel body (2) with their bases joined together. There are slits/cuts/holes (3) and (4) in the lower portion of the smaller body so that water can move from the bigger body into smaller body and vice-versa. The smaller body.has a false base (25) to reduce the volume of the lower portion of this unit which serves as a water tank (12) too. A water pump (5) mounted on a stand with wheels (6), rests on top of the smaller body. This stand is connected, through strings (7) and (8) to a pulley (9) on one side and the pulley of a slow-moving motor (10) on another side. This motor can rotate at very slow speed in both clock-wise and anti clock-wise directions. And, as it rotates, the stand also moves from left to right and from right to left. The inlet of the water pump is connected to a pipe (11) which is immersed in the water tank below. The outlet of the water pump is connected to a pipe (13) which is joined to a set of three pipes (14, 15, 16) having a number of small-small holes. This pipe, along with the set of three pipes, enters the smaller steel body through a slit (not shown in the figure) in its rear part. The smaller steel body has two cage-like stands (17, 18) for keeping the dishes. On upper stand are placed container dishes (like tumblers, bowls, bigger bowls, pressure cooker), plates etc. and on lower stand are kept other dishes like small bowls, knives, forks, spoons, etc. in their respective spaces. The positioning of the three pipes having small-small holes is such that the upper stand has a pipe above and a pipe beneath it and the lower stand has a pipe below it. Beneath the upper stand are two shafts (19) mounted on thrust bearings. Their upper ends rise a little above the stand and are attached to scrubbers. The pulleys of these shafts are connected, through strings, to the pulley of a fast moving motor (20). Bigger bowls used for cooking, like pressure cookers etc., are placed upside down with scrubbers inside their bodies, to facilitate scrubbing when the motor rotates at high speed. They are held firmly in their places by clamps (26) fixed on the upper stand. Below the stands and just above the water tank is a very fine net / sieve (21) to filter water before allowing it to fall into the<br>
water tank.. Inlet (22) and outlet (23) pipes are connected to solenoid valves (not shown in the figure). When the solenoid valves are activated on passage of current, water gets filled in or drained out of the water tank respectively. A water heater (24), fitted with a thermostat, heats water in the tank to the desired temperature. The entire system is electrically connected to suitable timing devices.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION     To start, used dishes are placed on the stands. Tumblers, bowls, etc., are placed upside down on upper stand (17). Bigger bowls used for cooking, like pressure cookers etc. are placed upside down with scrubbers (19) inside their bodies, to facilitate scrubbing when the motor (20) rotates at high speed. They are held firmly in their places by clamps (26) fixed on the upper stand. Other dishes like plates, knives, forks, spoons, etc., are placed in their respective spaces on lower stand (18). Water is filled in the tank. Some cleaning liquid is also mixed into it. Heater (24) is switched on. When the temperature of the water reaches a certain point, the heater is automatically switched off. Temperature of the water is maintained throughout the operation. At this point, the water pump (5), the slow moving motor (10), the fast moving motor (20) are all simultaneously activated. These are all attached to suitable timing device(s). When the water pump is switched on, it sucks hot water and transmits it to pipe number (14). The hot water mixed with cleaning liquid is then distributed to all the pipes and forces its way out from the tiny holes with great speed and pressure. At the same time, the fast moving motor (20) starts rotating at high speed and along with it the attached shafts with scrubbers also rotate. The big bowls placed upside down with scrubbers inside their bodies are thoroughly scrubbed. Simultaneously, the slow moving motor (10) also starts rotating in clockwise direction and as it rotates, the stand with wheels, with water pump along with connected pipes mounted on it, also moves from left to right. After some time, this motor moves in the reverse direction, i.e., in anti-clock wise direction, and as it moves, the stand just referred to also moves from right to left. This rhythmic movement goes on. As the pipes move, hot water mixed with cleaning liquid is put on the inner and outer bodies of all the dishes. Food particles and oil etc. fall down and remain in the net/sieve (21) below. The water passes through the net/sieve and goes back into the tank and is thus recycled a number of times in a span of 2-3 minutes with the result that all the dishes have been washed with the cleaning liquid mixed hot water and have been thoroughly cleaned. They have only to be rinsed now. For rinsing, the water pump, the slow moving motor, the fast moving<br>
motor, the heater, are switched off and the solenoid valve in the drainage pipe activated to drain out water. When the tank becomes empty, the solenoid valve in the inlet pipe (22) is activated and the tank is again filled with water. After that the entire process referred to above is repeated with the only difference that now cold water is used instead of hot water. In about 1-2 minutes all the dishes are rinsed. The solenoid valve in the drainage pipe is again activated to drain out water. The dishes can either be taken off the shelves or allowed to remain there to become completely dry.<br>
The entire process of washing about 60-70 dishes is thus completed in a very short time.<br>
Thus this invention is very simple and most effective for washing dishes mechanically.<br>
ADVANTAGES   This system saves a lot of time otherwise spent on washing dishes manually, uses less water and cleans the dishes in a hygienic manner untouched by hands.<br><br><br><br></td>
