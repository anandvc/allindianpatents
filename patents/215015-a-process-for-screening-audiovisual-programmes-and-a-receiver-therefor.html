				<td>Method of receiving and of screening sequences of topic-<br>
based audiovisual programmes, and receiver for<br>
implementing the method.<br>
The invention relates to a method of receiving and of screening<br>
audiovisual programmes broadcast by a transmitter to receivers and more<br>
especially when the programmes are selectable as a function of a specified<br>
criterion. The invention also relates to the receivers for implementing the<br>
method.<br>
The invention applies more particularly to digital television<br>
receivers/decoders. The network broadcasts audiovisual programmes more<br>
commonly referred to as "events" and data intended for referencing them.<br>
These data are for example defined in the DVE3-SI specifications ("Digital<br>
Video Broadcast - specification for Service Information") EN 300 468 V1.3.1<br>
(published by the ETSI). They take the form of tables and of descriptors<br>
which describe the objects transmitted on the broadcasting network. A<br>
service is an uninterrupted series of events broadcast on a specified stream.<br>
The DVB-SI standard defines in particular the format of following<br>
tables such as: NIT. SDT, EIT and possibly BAT. The NIT table gives the<br>
general structure of the network and indicates the list of transport streams<br>
and services broadcast. The SDT table gives additional information relating<br>
to the services, for example the unencrypted name of a service. The EIT<br>
table indicates a list of events for each service, and makes it possible in<br>
particular to indicate the events currently being broadcast. The BAT table<br>
contains information on several services clustered together into a bouquet of<br>
services which can be output by several broadcasting networks.<br>
With the aid of the data contained in these tables, the receiver knows<br>
the general content of the audiovisual programmes broadcast by the<br>
network. The user can thus search for programmes and services as a<br>
function of certain criteria, such as topic.<br><br>
Televised programmes are often intercut with relatively short<br>
sequences composed for example of advertising flashes, or of information<br>
flashes, or else of a video clip, or diverse audiovisual programmes whose<br>
durations vary from about ten seconds to several minutes. These sequences<br>
are broadcast, either between two events, or during an event. The user can<br>
choose the event which he watches, this is the "current" event broadcast by<br>
the "current" service but he does not choose the content of the sequences.<br>
The short programmes making up the sequence have no topic related to the<br>
current event. Hence, the viewer may grow weary of these sequences whose<br>
content is of little overall interest to him. He might be inclined to change<br>
services. The present invention makes it possible to offer the user<br>
sequences of more interest to him.<br>
The subject of the invention is a process for screening audiovisual<br>
programmes transmitted by a centre and received by a television receiver,<br>
programmes of a first type being broadcast on a first broadcasting service<br>
and being selectable by the user, the process comprising at the receiver<br>
level:<br>
- a first step of screening a programme of a second type extracted from a<br>
second broadcasting service selected by the receiver,<br>
- a second step of screening at least one programme of a first type<br>
commencing at a first moment specified by the centre,<br>
and characterized in that it comprises a third step of screening a filler<br>
programme, the said programme being screened following the screening of<br>
the second programme and stopping at the start of the screening of the first<br>
programme.<br>
It should be noted straightaway that the audiovisual programmes to<br>
which the present invention relates may be provided either by a<br>
unidirectional or bidirectional network. The programmes of second type are<br>
broadcast continuously on several services each corresponding to a<br>
particular topic. At a precise instant of the current event, the data selected for<br><br>
display are switched from the current service to the service broadcasting<br>
programmes of second type. The broadcaster specifies the duration of<br>
screening of the programmes of the second type. When this duration has<br>
elapsed, the receiver switches the screening onto the current service. The<br>
receiver selects the service broadcasting the programmes of the second<br>
type. The sequence broadcast in the current service is thus replaced with a<br>
sequence of programmes of second type whose topics correspond better to<br>
a criterion specific to the receiver. The broadcasting of the various<br>
programmes of second type is not synchronized with the sequences<br>
specified in the announcement signals, this generally entailing the untimely<br>
curtailing of at least one programme of second type, at the start and/or at the<br>
end of the sequence. Moreover, the switching times are not negligible and<br>
therefore, may entail the appearance of a black screen for a few instants. To<br>
avoid this the present invention makes provision to replace the black screen<br>
with a filler programme, this making it possible to eliminate any<br>
discontinuities of the audiovisual programme. The receiver displays a filler<br>
programme at the start and/or at the end of the sequence.<br>
According to one embodiment, this criterion for selecting the filler<br>
programmes corresponds to the profile of the user.<br>
The announcement signal contains a temporal indication of the start<br>
of the sequence. According to a particularly simple embodiment, the decoder<br>
switches from the current service to a topic-based service following the<br>
receipt of the announcement signal.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the receiver is furnished with a<br>
memory for recording audiovisual programmes for real-time storage of the<br>
programme of second type corresponding to the criteria stored in the<br>
receiver. The programme currently being recorded is screened at the start of<br>
the advertising sequence.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a receiver of audiovisual<br>
programmes comprising a means of receiving data broadcast from a network<br>
consisting of at least one first service broadcasting programmes of a first<br><br>
type which are selectable by the user and of a plurality of second services<br>
broadcasting programmes of a second type, of a means of switching from<br>
one service to another service and a means for sending the programmes to<br>
a screening facility, characterized in that it comprises a means for interposing<br>
a filler programme between a programme of a second type and a<br>
programme of a first type received from the network.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will<br>
emerge from the description of the exemplary embodiments which will follow.<br>
taken by way of nonlimiting examples, with reference to the appended<br>
figures in which:<br>
• Figure 1 represents a receiver implementing the invention,<br>
• Figure 2 shows an exemplary appearance of a screen for the<br>
programming of the display mechanism,<br>
• Figure 3 represents the diagram of the mechanism for switching<br>
services according to the invention,<br>
• Figures 4 represent timing diagrams of the programme and<br>
screening of the programmes according to a preferred<br>
embodiment,<br>
• Figures 5 represent timing diagrams for the broadcasting, storage<br>
and screening of programmes according to an improvement,<br>
• Figure 6 represents an exemplary appearance of a screen for the<br>
programming of the various topics expected by a user.<br>
A receiver according to the invention will first of all be described,<br>
followed, as represented in Figure 3, by the mechanism for switching to the<br>
services broadcasting programmes of the second type. Finally,<br>
improvements and variant embodiments will be described.<br><br>
A receiver according to the invention is described in Figure 1. The<br>
receiver is, for example, a decoder in accordance with the DVB<br>
specifications. It uses an ISO/IEC 13818-1 transport layer.<br>
The decoder is linked to an antenna 1, itself linked to a tuner. We<br>
shall see subsequently that there may be two of them. The signal provided<br>
by the tuner is demodulated by a demodulator 3. The demodulated data are<br>
deinterlaced and corrected by an error-correcting circuit 4 and sent to a<br>
demultiplexer 5. The latter comprises a certain number of filters programmed<br>
by a microprocessor 23 as a function of the various applications supported<br>
by the decoder. The microprocessor 23 is connected to a memory 12<br>
comprising the operating system as well as the resident or downloaded<br>
programs for implementing applications. The memory is illustrated in the<br>
form of a single block, but physically may comprise several blocks of<br>
different kinds; random access memory RAM, read only memory ROM,<br>
reprogrammable memory EEPROM or FLASH. The microprocessor is also<br>
connected to a clock circuit 27. A character generator 15 allows the<br>
generation of control or graphics menus relating to the parameters of the<br>
decoder or to a particular application. The video signal generated is<br>
multiplexed with one of the video signals originating from the video decoder<br>
17 to a SCART socket linked to a television screen 22. The multiplexing<br>
circuit 20 is managed by the microprocessor 23. For the clarity of the<br>
diagram, only the most important connections of the microprocessor 23 are<br>
illustrated.<br>
The audio or video sections or packets filtered by the demultiplexer<br>
are stored in predefined areas of a buffer memory 6. The decoder may also<br>
comprise a hard disk 25 linked to the microprocessor with the aid of an<br>
interface 26 allowing fast transfers of information. The decoder is also<br>
furnished with a remote control 11, linked to the microprocessor by an<br>
infrared link.<br>
It was stated previously that the broadcasting network may be<br>
unidirectional (over-the-air or satellite network) or bidirectional (by wire,<br>
cable, Internet, for example). Specifically, it is unnecessary for the receiver to<br><br>
send messages to the broadcaster via the same means of communication as<br>
the network for broadcasting the audiovisual data. The broadcasting network<br>
transmits so-called general services, the user selects the current service<br>
from them so as to watch the current event. The network also transmits so-<br>
called "topic-based" services. The topic-based services continuously<br>
broadcast short audiovisual programmes (called "flashes" subsequently in<br>
the document) possessing the same topic for a given channel. The list of<br>
references for accessing the topic-based services as well as the topic<br>
associated with each service is extracted from the NIT tables. A proprietor<br>
field contains an indicator specifying that the service is "topic-based".<br>
The programme memory of the decoder contains a software module<br>
for Managing the Flashes, or GF module. One of the functions of this module<br>
consists in creating the abovementioned array. The other functions will be<br>
described subsequently.<br>
The GF module comprises a programming part consisting in searching<br>
for the topics broadcast and in receiving from the user the criterion for<br>
selecting the flashes to be screened.<br>
First of all, the decoder analyses the NIT tables in order to determine<br>
the number and the topic of the topic-based services currently being<br>
broadcast. The EIT table gives in particular the description of the content of<br>
the events (and hence of the flashes which are short events), by virtue of its<br>
descriptors. The descriptors authorize the coding of proprietary data owned<br>
by the broadcaster, thus making it possible to broadcast contents (the tag<br>
content_descriptor), according to a standardized format. The present<br>
invention introduces new fields into these descriptors, specifying therein: the<br>
description of a flash, the topic or topics of the flash, the start of programme<br>
(date and time coded on 40 bits), the duration (coded on 24 bits), etc. The<br>
EIT table contains in particular a field coded on 12 bits which authorizes a<br>
maximum length of 4093 bytes for transporting the descriptors.<br><br>
These latter descriptors are used by the broadcaster to describe the<br>
content of the event, and hence for example the topic to which it belongs.<br>
They may be of two types:<br>
1. the "content_descriptor" descriptors of standardized identifier: 0x54 in<br>
hexadecimal.<br>
2. the "user defined" descriptors of standardized identifier from 0x80 a OxFE<br>
in hexadecimal.<br>
If the descriptor of type "content_descriptor" is used to code the<br>
topic or topics of an event, a size coded on 8 bits is available, and hence 256<br>
bytes are available, this being amply sufficient.<br>
A descriptor coding which can be recommended is the following<br>
(described as are the descriptors in the DVB-SI standard):<br>
broadcaster_defined_content_descriptor() {<br>
descriptortag 8 bits uimsbf<br>
descriptor_ength 8 bits uimsbf<br>
for ( i=0; i<n i></n>
descriptor_content_byte 8 bits uimsbf<br>
}<br>
}<br>
with:<br>
descriptor_tag : lies between 0x80 and OxFE,<br>
descripto_ength : the length of the content of the descriptor which<br>
follows the descriptorjength,<br>
descriptor_content_byte : the coding of the topic or topics to which<br>
the event corresponds, and which the broadcaster wishes to specify<br>
(normally the coding must fit into a byte, but a variable size of the content<br>
makes it possible to associate one and the same event with several topics).<br>
By analysing the content of the descriptors contained in the EIT<br>
tables, the decoder creates in its memory the array 1 below which contains<br>
the list of references for accessing the topic-based services currently being<br>
broadcast (ld-service_i) and the associated topics and subtopics.<br><br><br>
ARRAY 1<br>
In the example of array 1-, three main topics are offered: Information,<br>
Advertising and Video Clips, and for this set of three topics, twelve subtopics.<br>
In the example the network comprises twelve topic-based services.<br>
Next, the user executes the programming part enabling him to input<br>
the criterion for selecting the topic-based service. The menu displayed in<br>
Figure 2 then appears, its content is formulated directly on the basis of<br>
array 1. The user navigates around this menu with the aid of the four<br>
direction keys of his remote control. The element pointed at is picked out by<br>
either emboldening its outline, with the aid of the highlighted or flashing title,<br>
or any other graphical distinguishing means. The first list indicates the topic,<br>
each topic affords access to a second particular list of subtopics. In the<br>
example of Figure 2, the "Advertising" topic is selected and the "Fashion"<br>
subtopic is picked out. The user currently has the choice of selecting or<br>
otherwise this criterion. The " ? " and " ?" keys are used to go between<br><br>
the two lists. The " OK " key makes it possible to select what causes the "X "<br>
symbol to appear on the left of the subtopic thus signalling its selection. In<br>
order to no longer select it, it is sufficient to press the "OK" key again. The<br>
" enter" key enters the selection as a whole and quits the programming part<br>
of the GF module.<br>
If the user selects nothing, the GF module will not be operational, the<br>
sequences of flashes initially provided by the broadcaster will not be<br>
replaced. Otherwise, following the execution of the programming part of the<br>
GF module, the decoder programmes its demultiplexer and its second tuner<br>
if it has one. so as to receive the data of the service corresponding to the first<br>
subtopic selected. If subsequently this service ceases to transmit, the<br>
decoder goes to another selected service.<br>
The general principle of the GF module during operation is shown in<br>
Figure 3. An event extracted from the current service is screened. At a<br>
certain moment, the broadcaster transmits in the data of this service and<br>
between two blocks of audiovisual data, an announcement signal specifying<br>
that a sequence of a certain duration will soon be broadcast. At the moment<br>
specified in the announcement signal, the decoder programmes its<br>
demultiplexer so as to receive the data of the service broadcasting flashes<br>
corresponding to the criteria defined by the user. For example, the user<br>
preferring advertisements relating to fashion, the demultiplexer selects the<br>
service broadcasting flashes having "Fashion" as topic. If the user has<br>
chosen several topics, the services broadcasting them are successively<br>
selected by the GF module. When all have been screened once, the first is<br>
selected again. This selection is performed with the aid of a pointer<br>
addressing in the array 1 the services whose topics are chosen by the user.<br>
At the end of the duration specified in the announcement signal, the<br>
demultiplexer is programmed again so as to receive the data of the current<br>
service which are sent to the television screen.<br>
The announcement signal comprises the following information:<br><br><br>
Advantageously, the announcement signal is repeated several times<br>
so as to be properly received by all the decoders. By virtue of the "Current<br>
time" data item, the decoder resynchronizes its clock to commence at the<br>
precise instant t1 the screening of the sequence of a duration D1.<br>
According to a very simplified embodiment, the broadcaster sends<br>
only a single announcement signal at the instant at which the sequence<br>
starts. In this signal, the "Current time" and "Instant t1" fields are<br>
unnecessary and can be eliminated.<br>
The flashes are broadcast continuously in the topic-based services.<br>
The start of the sequence (instant T1) does not generally coincide with the<br>
start of a flash. So as not to switch during the broadcasting of a flash and<br>
thereby cause a part to be missed, the decoder sends a filler event to the<br>
screen.<br>
Figures 4 show the timing diagram of the programmes broadcast on<br>
the current service (Figure 4-a), the topic-based service (Figure 4-b) and the<br>
programmes screened (Figure 4-c). They show in particular the moment of<br>
programme of the filler event. The announcement signals transmitted<br>
between the blocks of audiovisual data of the current event contain a data<br>
item indicating the broadcasting at the instant t1 of a sequence. This<br>
sequence contains flashes whose topics are diverse. It is screened when the<br>
user does not specify any criterion or when the decoder is not furnished with<br>
the GF module. At the same time, the topic-based service continually<br>
transmits flashes in a loop. In the example of Figure 4-b, the topic-based<br>
service displayed transmits 9 different flashes having the same topic.<br>
According to a first embodiment, switching between the current<br>
service and a topic-based service is effected directly. This first embodiment<br>
is simple but has the drawback of cutting the flashes. The description which<br>
will follow incorporates the improvement enabling this problem to be solved.<br><br>
The instant t1 occurs at the moment of the broadcasting of the flash 4.<br>
The flash 5 which is broadcast at the moment t2 after t1, can be screened in<br>
full. To avoid screening just a part of the flash 4, the decoder sends a filler<br>
event to the screen in the course of the moment delimited by t1 and t2. A<br>
filler event possesses an audiovisual content whose duration of screening is<br>
of no importance to the viewer. It is for example a still image enlivened by<br>
music. It may also be a documentary about a region. The objective of a filler<br>
event is to occupy the television screen between the moment t1 and the start<br>
of the next flash. It also makes it possible to do away with the brief black<br>
screen which appears when switching services. At the moment t2, the<br>
decoder checks that the flash 5 has a sufficiently short duration for it to be<br>
completely incorporated in the sequence. Since this is the case, the flash 5 is<br>
screened. At the instant t3, the flash 6 is received and, after having<br>
undergone the same check, is screened. At the instant t4, the flash 7 is<br>
received. The du ation of this flash is greater than the remaining duration of<br>
the sequence, there is therefore no longer enough time to screen it. The GF<br>
module sends the screen a filler event which is screened up to the instant t5<br>
which terminates the sequence. The current programme is then screened<br>
again.<br>
Advantageously, the filler event is a looped audiovisual programme in<br>
which it is impossible to discern the start transition and end transition. The<br>
duration of the loop must be sufficiently long for the user not to see the same<br>
parts too often.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the filler event is unique and is<br>
recorded in a memory of the decoder. Thus, switching is fast and does not<br>
leave any black screen appearing on the screen. The size of the memory<br>
occupied is generally short (especially if this event is a picture with music),<br>
the filler event can be stored in a part of the work memory, or if it is too long,<br>
in the hard disk 25.<br>
A variant consists in the network broadcasting in addition to the topic-<br>
based services a so-called "filler" service permanently broadcasting a filler<br>
event. According to this variant, the GF module searches through this service<br><br>
for the filler event and stores it in memory. The broadcaster can change the<br>
filler event, for example, once a day.<br>
At the precise moment specified by the broadcaster in the<br>
announcement signal, the event interrupted by the sequence must resume.<br>
The data selected for display are then switched from the service<br>
broadcasting programmes of second type to the current service.<br>
An improvement of the present invention consists in using a memory<br>
of large capacity to record at least one flash. This memory can consist of a<br>
memory circuit of large capacity, or of a small hard disk (such as that<br>
represented at 25 in Figure 1), or of a magnetic tape. According to the<br>
present improvement, the decoder constantly records the flash broadcast by<br>
the selected topic-based service, that is to say the "current flash". A new<br>
flash received overwrites the previous one. Figures 5 show the timing<br>
diagram of the programmes broadcast on the current service (Figure 5-a),<br>
the topic-based service (Figure 5-b), the programme read from the memory<br>
by the GF module (Figure 5-c) and the screened programmes (Figure 5-d).<br>
When the sequence commences (instant t1), the GF module stops the<br>
screening of the current event and reads the content of the flash memory at<br>
the start of the recording of the flash currently being broadcast. The<br>
broadcasting of this flash (4) commenced at the instant t0 and the flash is<br>
read at the instant T1. A time shift of (t1 - tO) occurs between the receipt and<br>
the screening of the flash 4 and of those which will be screened thereafter.<br>
For this reason, this equipment is called a "Time Shifter". At the end of the<br>
screening of the flash 4 (instant t2), the GF module determines whether the<br>
next flash (flash 5) can be screened completely before the end of the<br>
sequence. This is the case: the flash 5 is therefore sent to the screen. At the<br>
end of the screening of the flash 5, the GF module checks whether the flash<br>
6 can also be screened but this is not the case. The GF module completes<br>
the remainder of the sequence to be displayed with a filler event until the<br>
instant t4 at which screening of the current event recommences. In this way,<br>
the screened sequence possesses the duration specified by the broadcaster.<br><br>
In certain cases this improvement makes it possible to reduce the screening<br>
time of the filler event and to add a flash to the sequence.<br>
An improvement of the present invention consists in the user<br>
programming the distribution of topics. For each of the topics present in the<br>
array 1 the user specifies the proportion of display which he desires. The<br>
proportions are advantageously indicated as a percentage, the total of the<br>
values indicated being 100.<br>
The array 2 below is an example of programming the distribution of<br>
themes. In the example, the user prefers especially the flashes of video clips<br>
of rap (he wants 50% of them), then the advertisements for the home (30%)<br>
and finally, the sports information (20%).<br><br>
ARRAY 2<br>
The user specifies the proportions in the menu of Figure 6 by running<br>
the programming part of the GF module and by inputting an integer from 0 to<br>
100 with the aid of the keypad of his remote control. The icon at the bottom<br><br>
left indicates to the user the percentage which he still has to assign. In the<br>
example, he has specified 20% of sports information flashes, 30% of home<br>
advertising flashes, he therefore still has to assign 50% of flashes over one<br>
or more other themes. The user can obviously return to a choice with the aid<br>
of the navigation buttons.<br>
A variant, aimed at simplifying the inputting of the choices, consists in<br>
the user allocating a scale, for example from 0 to 9, for each flash topic. The<br>
GF module then converts the values input into a percentage.<br>
The user having entered his choices, the GF module creates the<br>
array 3 below in memory, this array possessing as many rows as there are<br>
themes for which the user has specified a non-zero number. The array<br>
contains four columns. The first and the second column identify the topic-<br>
based service. The third contains the percentages programmed by the user<br>
for each theme. The fourth contains counters for determining the number of<br>
flashes which have already been screened. The fourth column of the array is<br>
updated during each screening of a sequence by incrementing the value of<br>
the counter. At the start of the displaying of a sequence and at the end of<br>
each screening of a flash, the array is read and analysed by the GF module<br>
during normal operation so as to determine the topic-based service in which<br>
the decoder must search for the flash to be screened.<br><br>
ARRAY 3<br>
In the example of the above array 3, the GF module will select the<br>
topic-based service broadcasting "Information/Sports" once, will then select<br>
"Advertising/Home" twice and finally will select "Video Clips/Rap" four times.<br><br>
In a simple manner, the selection is performed by chronological scanning of<br>
the array.<br>
A first manner of proceeding consists in updating the counters with the<br>
values programmed by the user and in decrementing them during each<br>
screening. When all the counters are at 0, they are reupdated with the<br>
programmed values. A first manner of working consists in the counters<br>
counting a number of screened flashes. Another method consists in counting<br>
the screening time for each topic. In the latter case, seconds are counted by<br>
adding up in each counter the durations (in seconds) of the flashes for each<br>
topic.<br>
A variant consists in requiring that the minimum value of each topic be<br>
equal to 1, including in respect of those which the user announces to be of no<br>
interest and for which he programmes a zero value. This variant allows the<br>
broadcaster to ensure that each topic will be seen at least once after a<br>
certain time, doing so while complying with the expected display proportions<br>
if the values for the topics of high interest to the user have sufficiently large<br>
values. This variant requires that the array 3 contain as many rows as there<br>
are broadcast topics and hence topic-based services.<br>
Another variant consists in using a geometrical series to alter the<br>
starting value of the counters. In this variant the starting value of a counter is<br>
equal to k times (k &gt; 1) the value of the counter for the topic of immediately<br>
lower interest. The user therefore provides an ordering of the topics offered<br>
to him. This ordering is for example, from the most interesting to the least<br>
interesting. This gives:<br>
- for p[j] the weight of the j-th topic (0 is the index of the least interesting topic<br>
and n-1 the index of the most interesting topic, for n possible topics), and for<br>
k &gt; 1 we choose:<br>
p[i] = k*p[i-1], with p[0]= 1 .<br>
First of all, a counter, initialized at the start with the successive values<br>
of the series p[i], is associated with each topic by associating p[0] with the<br>
least preferred topic and p[n-1] with the most preferred topic. The associated<br><br>
counter is then decremented by 1 each time a topic is displayed. Thus the<br>
desired function is indeed achieved.<br>
In this manner, the broadcaster has perfect control over the<br>
probabilities of display of each topic. Indeed, it may be demonstrated by<br>
recurrence that:<br><br>
This shows that, for k=2 for example, the topic designated as the most<br>
desired will be displayed around 50% of the time, the next topic 25%, the<br>
next topic 12.5%, etc.<br>
and for k=3, the probabilities become : 67%, 22%, 7%. etc<br>
and for k=4 : 75%, 19%, 5%, etc<br>
An improvement consists in assigning a priority to the flashes. To do<br>
this, the broadcaster sets up a priority flag in each flash descriptor indicating<br>
in a simple manner whether the latter does or does not have priority. It is<br>
recalled that this descriptor is in an EIT table and that in this way the decoder<br>
knows the topic, the duration and the priority of all the flashes broadcast by<br>
all the topic-based services. The decoder receives this indicator and the GF<br>
module processes it in the following manner: when a choice of topic-based<br>
service is possible, the GF module chooses the service with the most<br>
numerous priority flashes broadcast during the sequence announced. In the<br>
example illustrated by the array 3, the GF module can in fact display either<br>
"Information/Sports" or "Advertising/Home" or "Video Clips/Rap". According<br>
to the improvement, it analyses the priority of the flashes transmitted by the<br>
three topic-based services in the course of the sequence and selects the<br>
topic-based service which possesses the largest number of priority flashes in<br>
the course of the sequence. Advantageously for him. the broadcaster can<br>
demand a higher price from the providers who demand a higher priority for<br>
their flashes.<br>
A variant of the improvement consists in assigning a priority level to<br>
each topic rather than a flag whose value is binary. For example, this level<br>
takes the values from 0 to 4, the value 4 being that of highest priority.<br><br>
According to this variant, the GF module adds up the priority levels of the<br>
flashes broadcast by the selectable services and in the course of the<br>
announced sequence, and selects the one which possesses the highest<br>
value.<br>
Another variant of this improvement consists in assigning a weight<br>
designated by the broadcaster to each topic, thereby enabling certain topics<br>
to be given priority. This weight is used jointly with the weights designated by<br>
the user (for example by adding up the two weights), and thus modifies the<br>
values taken into account in respect of the counters at the moment of the<br>
selecting of a topic. This variant enables the broadcaster to "force", at the<br>
level of the receivers, the displaying of the flashes broadcast by a topic-<br>
based service declared to have priority.<br>
A variant consists in the receiver automatically determining the profile<br>
of the user anc correlating this profile with the topics offered. There is<br>
therefore no longer any need for the manual programming phase illustrated<br>
by Figure 2. The profile can for example be determined on the basis of the<br>
actions of the user faced with certain flash in the course of a learning phase.<br>
For example, if he user often changes services when he sees advertising<br>
flashes in the fashion sector, the GF module deduces therefrom that he<br>
should no longe be presented with flashes of this topic. It then decreases<br>
the proportion dedicated to this topic, by 10% for example. In tandem with<br>
the screening of the sequences, the receiver refines the profile of the user.<br>
Let us assume that flash topics relate to events, when the user asks to see<br>
these events, the GF module increases the proportion of the corresponding<br>
topics. For example, if a user asks to see the televised news (which is an<br>
event) frequently, the GF module is warned and increases the proportion of<br>
the "information" topic by 10% for example.<br>
An improvement consists in the GF module taking several users into<br>
account. The programming part then begins with the inputting of a user<br>
identifier, and each user inputs his profile or the distribution of the topics<br><br>
which he wishes to see appear in the flashes. The programming part of the<br>
GF module then creates as many distribution arrays as users. During normal<br>
execution, the users identify themselves, a single distribution array or profile<br>
is active at a time.<br>
If the decoder has available just a single tuner, the programmes and<br>
the signalling must be multiplexed on one and the same channel in the form<br>
of data packets referenced by different PIDs. "Top of the range" decoders<br>
have available two tuners to receive signals originating from two<br>
broadcasting channels of different frequency. In this case, an improvement<br>
consists in programming a tuner to receive the current event and the<br>
announcement signals, and the other the topic-based service selected by the<br>
GF module. The data are stored in parallel in the memory as and when they<br>
are received. Switching between the current event and the flashes then takes<br>
place at the level of the procedure for reading the memory.<br>
