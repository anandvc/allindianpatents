				<td>A MICROELECTRONIC PACKAGE AND<br>
METHOD OF FABRICATION THEREFOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention: The present invention relates to a microelectronic package and<br>
method of fabrication therefor, and generally to apparatus and processes for packaging<br>
microelectronic dice. In particular, the present invention relates to a packaging<br>
technology that, encapsulates a microelectronic die within a microelectronic package<br>
core.<br>
State of the Art: Higher performance, lower cost, increased miniaturization of<br>
integrated circuit components, and greater packaging density of integrated circuits are<br>
ongoing goals of the computer industry. As these goals are achieved, microelectronic<br>
dice become smaller. Of course, the goal of greater packaging density requires that the<br>
entire microelectronic die package be equal to or only slightly larger (about 10% to<br>
30%) than the size of the microelectronic die itself. Such microelectronic die packaging<br>
is called a "chip scale packaging" or "CSP".<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, true CSP involves fabricating build-up layers directly on an<br>
active surface 204 of a microelectronic die 202. The build-up layers may include a<br>
dielectric layer 206 disposed on the active surface 204. Conductive traces 208 may be<br>
formed on the dielectric layer 206, wherein a portion of each conductive trace 208<br>
contacts at least one contact 212 on the active surface 204. External contacts, such as<br>
solder balls or conductive pins for contact with an external component (not shown), may<br>
be fabricated to electrically contact at least one conductive trace 208. FIG. 20 illustrates<br>
the external contacts as solder balls 214 which are surrounded by a solder mask material<br>
216 on the dielectric layer 206. However in such true CSP, the surface area provided by<br>
the microelectronic die active surface 204 generally does not provide enough surface for<br>
all of the external contacts needed to contact the external component (not shown) for<br>
certain types of microelectronic dice (e.g., logic).<br>
Additional surface area can be provided with the use of an interposer, such as a<br>
substrate (substantially rigid material) or a flex component (substantially flexible<br>
material). FIG. 21 illustrates a substrate interposer 222 having a microelectronic die 224<br>
attached to and in electrical contact with a first surface 226 of the substrate interposer<br>
222 through small solder balls 228. The small solder balls 228 extend between contacts<br>
232 on the microelectronic die 224 and conductive traces 234 on the substrate interposer<br>
first surface 226. The conductive traces 234 are in discrete electrical contact with bond<br>
pads 236 on a second surface 238 of the substrate interposer 222 through vias 242 that<br>
extend through the substrate interposer 222. External contacts 244 are formed on the<br>
bond pads 236 (shown as solder balls). The external contacts 244 are utilized to achieve<br>
electrical communication between the microelectronic die 224 and an external electrical<br>
system (not shown).<br>
The use of the substrate interposer 222 requires number of processing steps, which<br>
increases the cost of the package. Additionally, the use of the small solder balls 228<br>
presents crowding problems which can result in shorting between the small solder balls<br>
228 and can present difficulties in inserting underfill material between the<br>
microelectronic die 224 and the substrate interposer 222 to prevent contamination and to<br>
increase mechanical reliability. Furthermore, necessity of having two sets of solder balls<br>
(i.e., small solder balls 228 and external contacts 244) to achieve connection between the<br>
microelectronic die 224 and the external electrical system decreases the overall<br>
performance of the microelectronic die package.<br>
Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop new apparatus and techniques to provide<br>
additional surface area to form traces for use in CSP applications and eliminate the necessity of<br>
the substrate interposer.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a microelectronic package, comprising: a<br>
microelectronic package core having a first surface and an opposing second surface, said<br>
microelectronic package core having at least one opening defined therein extending from said<br>
microelectronic package core first surface to said microelectronic package core second surface;<br>
at least one microelectronic die disposed within said at least one opening, said at least one<br>
microelectronic die having an active surface; and an encapsulation material adhering said<br>
microelectronic package core to said at least one microelectronic die.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of fabricating a microelectronic package,<br>
said method comprising the steps of: providing a microelectronic package core having a first<br>
surface and an opposing second surface, said microelectronic package core having at least one<br>
opening defined therein extending from said microelectronic package core first surface to said<br>
microelectronic package core second surface; disposing at least one microelectronic die within<br>
said at least one opening, said at least one microelectronic die having an active surface; and<br>
adhering said microelectronic package core to said at least one microelectronic die with an<br>
encapsulation material.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of fabricating a microelectronic package,<br>
said method comprising the steps of: providing a microelectronic package core having a first<br>
surface and an opposing second surface, said microelectronic package core having at least one<br>
opening defined therein extending from said microelectronic package core first surface to said<br>
microelectronic package core second surface; abutting a protective film against said<br>
microelectronic package core first surface, wherein said protective film spans said at least one<br>
opening; disposing at least one microelectronic die within said at least one opening, wherein an<br>
active surface of said microelectronic die abuts a portion of said protective film; adhering said<br>
microelectronic package core to said at least one microelectronic die with an encapsulation<br>
material, wherein a portion of said encapsulation material fills a portion of said opening to form at<br>
least one encapsulation material surface abutting said protective film; and removing said<br>
protective film.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of fabricating a microelectronic<br>
package, said method comprising the steps of: providing a microelectronic package core having<br>
a first surface and an opposing second surface, said microelectronic package core having a<br>
plurality of openings defined therein extending from said microelectronic package core first<br>
surface to said microelectronic package core second surface; abutting a protective film against<br>
said microelectronic package core first surface, wherein said protective film spans said at least<br>
one opening; disposing a plurality of microelectronic dice within corresponding openings of the<br>
microelectronic package core, wherein active surfaces of each of said microelectronic dice abuts<br>
a portion of said protective film; adhering said microelectronic package core to said plurality of<br>
microelectronic dice with an encapsulation material, wherein a portion of said encapsulation<br>
material fills a portion of said openings to form a plurality of encapsulation material surfaces<br>
abutting said protective film; removing said protective film; and singulating each microelectronic<br>
die by cutting through said microelectronic package core.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT<br>
Although FIGs. 1-19 illustrate various views of the present invention, these figures<br>
are not meant to portray microelectronic assemblies in precise detail. Rather, these<br>
figures illustrate microelectronic assemblies in a manner to more clearly convey the<br>
concepts of the present invention. Additionally, elements common between the figures<br>
retain the same numeric designation.<br>
The present invention includes a packaging technology that places at least one<br>
microelectronic dice within at least one opening in a microelectronic package core and<br>
secures the microelectronic die/dice within the opening(s) with an encapsulation<br>
material. Build-up layers of dielectric materials and conductive traces are men<br>
fabricated on the microelectronic die, the encapsulant material, and the microelectronic<br>
package core to form a microelectronic package.<br>
The technical advantage of this invention is that the present invention enables the<br>
microelectronic package to be built around the microelectronic die. This provides<br>
sufficient surface area to position external contacts, while eliminating the need for a<br>
substrate interposer, as discussed above. The elimination of the substrate interposer<br>
increases the performance of the microelectronic package by eliminating one set of<br>
solder connections. Furthermore, the elimination of the substrate interposer increases<br>
power delivery performance by bringing the circuitry within the microelectronic die<br>
closer to power delivery components (such as decoupling capacitors and the like) of the<br>
external electrical system to which the microelectronic package is attached.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a microelectronic package core 102 used to fabricate a<br>
microelectronic package. The microelectronic package core 102 preferably comprises a<br>
substantially planar material. The material used to fabricate the microelectronic package<br>
core 102 may include, but is not limited to, a Bisraaleimide Triazine ("BT") resin based<br>
material, an FR4 material (a flame retarding glass/epoxy material), various polyimide<br>
materials, ceramic material, and the like, and metallic materials (such as copper) and the<br>
like. The microelectronic package core 102 has at least one opening 104 extending<br>
therethrough from a first surface 106 of the microelectronic package core 102 to an<br>
opposing second surface 108 of the microelectronic package core 102. As shown in<br>
FIG. 2, the opening(s) 104 may be of any shape and size including, but not limited to,<br>
rectangular/square 104a, rectangular/square with rounded corners 104b, and circular<br>
104c. The only limitation on the size and shape of the opening(s) 104 is that they must<br>
be appropriately sized and shaped to house a corresponding microelectronic die therein,<br>
as will be discussed below.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the microelectronic package core first surface 106 abutting a<br>
protective film 112. The protective film 112 is preferably a substantially flexible<br>
material, such as Kapton® polyimide film (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company,<br>
Wilmington, Delaware), but may be made of any appropriate material, including<br>
metallic films. FIG. 4 illustrates microelectronic dice 114, each having an active<br>
surface 116 and a back surface 118, placed in corresponding openings 104 of the<br>
microelectronic package core 102. In a preferred embodiment (illustrated), the thickness<br>
117 of the microelectronic package core 102 and the thickness 115 of the<br>
microelectronic dice 114 are substantially equal. The microelectronic dice 114 are each<br>
placed such mat their active surfaces 116 abut the protective film 112. The protective<br>
film 112 may have an adhesive, such as silicone, which attaches to the microelectronic<br>
package core first surface 106 and the microelectronic die active surface 116. This<br>
adhesive-type film may be applied prior to placing the microelectronic die 114 and<br>
microelectronic package core 102 in a mold or other piece of equipment used for the<br>
encapsulation process. The protective film 112 may also be a non-adhesive film, such as<br>
a ETFE (ethylene - tetrafluoroethylene) or Teflon® film, which is held on the<br>
microelectronic die active surface 116 and the microelectronic package core first surface<br>
106 by an inner surface of the mold or other piece of equipment during the encapsulation<br>
process.<br>
The microelectronic die 114 is then encapsulated with an encapsulation material<br>
122, such as plastics, resins, epoxies, and the like. As shown in FIG. 5, the<br>
encapsulation material is disposed in portions of the opening(s) 104 not occupied by the<br>
microelectronic die 114. In FIG. 6, an alternate embodiment is shown wherein the<br>
microelectronic die thickness 115 is greater than the microelectronic package core<br>
thickness 117. Thus, the encapsulation material covers the microelectronic package core<br>
second surface 108 and portions of the opening(s) 104 not occupied by the<br>
microelectronic die 114, as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
The encapsulation of the microelectronic die 114 may be achieved by any known<br>
process, including but not limited to transfer and compression molding, and dispensing.<br>
The encapsulation material 122 secures the microelectronic die 114 within the<br>
microelectronic package core 102 and provides mechanical rigidity for the resulting<br>
structure and provides surface area for the subsequent build-up of trace layers.<br>
After encapsulation, the protective film 112 is removed, as shown in FIG. 7, to<br>
expose the microelectronic die active surface 116. As also shown in FIG. 7, the<br>
encapsulation material 122 is preferably molded to be a filler for the space between the<br>
microelectronic package core first surface 106 and the microelectronic die active surface<br>
116. This results in at least one surface 124 that is substantially planar to the<br>
microelectronic die active surface 116 and the microelectronic package core first surface<br>
106. The encapsulation material surface 124 may be utilized in further fabrication steps,<br>
along with the microelectronic package core first surface 106, as additional surface area<br>
for the formation of build-up layers, such as dielectric material layers and conductive<br>
traces.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the microelectronic package core 102 may include a plurality<br>
of vias 126 extending therethrough and/or a plurality of undercuts or channels 128 in<br>
microelectronic package core first surface 106. The embodiment shown in FIG. 8 shows<br>
the microelectronic die thickness 115 greater than the microelectronic package core<br>
thickness 117, such as shown in FIG. 6, but is not so limited. Such structures may be<br>
used to allow the encapsulation material 122 to flow therein, which will result in a more<br>
secure adherence of the encapsulation material 122 to the microelectronic package core<br>
102.<br>
In reference to FIGs. 7 and 8, it is noted that the encapsulation material 122 does<br>
not cover the microelectronic die back surface 118. The uncovered microelectronic back<br>
surface 118 allows for a heat sink to be directly attached thereto after each<br>
microelectronic die 114 has been singulated, as will be discussed below.<br>
Although the following description relates to a bumpless, built-up layer technique<br>
for the formation of build-up layers, the method of fabrication is not so limited. The<br>
build-up layers may be fabricated by a variety of techniques known in the art.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a view of a single microelectronic die 114 encapsulated with<br>
encapsulation material 122 within the microelectronic package core 102. The<br>
microelectronic die 114, of course, includes a plurality of electrical contacts 132 located<br>
 on the microelectronic die active surface 116. The electrical contacts 132 are electrically<br>
connected to circuitry (not shown) within the microelectronic die 114. Only four<br>
electrical contacts 132 are shown for sake of simplicity and clarity.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, a first dielectric layer 136, such as epoxy resin, polyimide,<br>
bisbenzocyclobutene, and the like, is disposed over the microelectronic die active<br>
surface 116 (including the electrical contacts 132), the microelectronic package core first<br>
surface 106, and the encapsulant material surface 124. The dielectric layers of the<br>
present invention are preferably filled epoxy resins available from Ibiden U.S.A. Corp.,<br>
Santa Clara, California, U.S.A. and from Ajinomoto U.S.A., Inc., Paramus, New Jersey,<br>
U.S.A. The formation of the first dielectric layer 136 may be achieved by any known<br>
process, including but not limited to lamination, spin coating, roll coating, and spray-on<br>
deposition.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, a plurality of vias 138 are then formed through the first<br>
dielectric layer 136. The plurality of vias 138 may be formed by any method known in<br>
the art, including but not limited to laser drilling, photolithography, and, if the first<br>
dielectric layer 136 is photoactive, forming the plurality of vias 138 in the same manner<br>
that a photoresist mask is made in a photolithographic process, as known in the art.<br>
A plurality of conductive traces 142 is formed on the first dielectric layer 136, as<br>
shown in FIG. 12, wherein a portion of each of the plurality of conductive traces 142<br>
extends into at least one of said plurality of vias 138 (see FIG. 11) to make electrical<br>
contact with the contacts 108. The plurality of conductive traces 142 may be made of<br>
any applicable conductive material, such as copper, aluminum, and alloys thereof.<br>
The plurality of conductive traces 142 may be formed by any known technique,"<br>
including but not limited to semi-additive plating and photolithographic techniques. An<br>
exemplary semi-additive plating technique can involve depositing a seed layer, such as a<br>
sputter-deposited or electroless-deposited metal on the first dielectric layer 136. A resist<br>
layer is then patterned on the seed layer, such as a titanium/copper alloy, followed by<br>
electrolytic plating of a layer of metal, such a copper, on the seed layer exposed by open<br>
areas in the patterned resist layer. The patterned resist layer is stripped and portions of<br>
the seed layer not having the layer of metal plated thereon is etched away. Other<br>
methods of forming the plurality of conductive traces 142 will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, a second dielectric layer 144 is disposed over the plurality of<br>
conductive traces 142 and the first dielectric layer 136. The formation of the second<br>
dielectric layer 144 may be achieved by any known process, including but not limited to<br>
film lamination, spin coating, roll coating, and spray-on deposition.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, a plurality of second vias 146 are then formed through the<br>
second dielectric layer 144. The plurality of second vias 146 may be formed any method<br>
known in the art, including but not limited to laser drilling and, if the second dielectric<br>
layer 144 is photoactive, forming the plurality of second vias 146 in the same manner<br>
that a photoresist mask is made in a photolithographic process, as known in the art.<br>
If the plurality of conductive traces 142 is not capable of placing the plurality of<br>
second vias 146 in an appropriate position, then other portions of the conductive traces<br>
are formed in the plurality of second vias 146 and on the second dielectric layer 144,<br>
another dielectric layer formed thereon, and another plurality of vias is formed in the<br>
dielectric layer, such as described in FIGs. 12-14. The layering of dielectric layers and<br>
the formation of conductive traces can be repeated until the vias are in an appropriate<br>
position. Thus, portions of a single conductive trace be formed from multiple portions<br>
thereof and can reside on different dielectric layers.<br>
A second plurality of conductive traces 148 may be formed, wherein a portion of<br>
each of the second plurality of conductive traces 148 extends into at least one of said<br>
plurality of second vias 146. The second plurality of conductive traces 148 each include<br>
a landing pad 150 (an enlarged area on the traces demarcated by a dashed line 152), as<br>
shown in FIG. 15.<br>
Once the second plurality of conductive traces 148 and landing pads 150 are<br>
formed, they can be used in the formation of conductive interconnects, such as solder<br>
bumps, solder balls, pins, and the like, for communication with external components (not<br>
shown). For example, a solder mask material 156 can be disposed over the second<br>
dielectric layer 144 and the second plurality of conductive traces 154 and landing pads<br>
150. A plurality of vias 160 is then formed in the solder mask material 156 to expose at<br>
least a portion of each of the landing pads 150, as shown in FIG. 16. A plurality of<br>
conductive bumps 158, such as solder bumps, can be formed, such as by, but not limited<br>
to, screen printing solder paste followed by a reflow process or by known plating<br>
techniques, on the exposed portion of each of the landing pads 154, as shown in FIG 17.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates a plurality of microelectronic dice 114 encapsulated with<br>
encapsulation material 122 within the microelectronic package core 102. At least one<br>
build-up layer is formed on the microelectronic dice active surfaces 116, the<br>
microelectronic package core first surface 106, and the encapsulant material surface 124<br>
in the manner previously discussed. The layer(s) of dielectric material and conductive<br>
traces comprising the build-up layer is simply designated together as build-up layer 162<br>
in FIG. 18. The individual microelectronic dice 114 are then singulated along lines 164<br>
(cut) through the build-up layer 162 and the microelectronic package core 102 to form at<br>
least one singulated microelectronic die package 166, as shown in FIG. 19.<br>
