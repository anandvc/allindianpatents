				<td>INHIBITORS OF IAP<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a mammal, and in particular to inhibitors of IAP proteins useful for treating cancers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically and biochemically regulated mechanism that plays an important role in development and homeostasis in invertebrates as well as vertebrates. Aberrancies in apoptosis that lead to premature cell death have been linked to a variety of developmental disorders. Deficiencies in apoptosis that result in the lack of cell death have been linked to cancer and chronic viral infections (Thompson et al., (1995) Science 267,1456-1462).<br>
One of the key effector molecules in apoptosis are the caspases (cysteine containing aspartate specific proteases). Caspases are strong proteases, cleaving after aspartic acid residues and once activated, digest vital cell proteins from within the cell. Since caspases are such strong proteases, tight control of this family of proteins is necessary to prevent premature cell death. In general, caspases are synthesized as largely inactive zymogens that require proteolytic processing in order to be active. This proteolytic processing is only one of the ways in which caspases are regulated. The second mechanism is through a family of proteins that bind and inhibit caspases.<br>
A family of molecules that inhibit caspases are the Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAP) (Deveraux et al., J Clin Immunol (1999), 19:388-398). lAPs were originally discovered in baculovirus by their functional ability to substitute for P35 protein, an anti-apoptotic gene (Crook et al. (1993) J Virology 67, 2168-2174). lAPs have been described in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human. Regardless of their origin, structurally, lAPs comprise one to three Baculovirus IAP repeat (B1R) domains, and most of them also possess a carboxyl-terminal RING finger motif. The BIR domain itself is a zinc binding domain of about 70 residues comprising 4 alpha-helices and 3 beta strands, with cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ion (Hinds et al., (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 648-651). It is the BIR domain that is believed to cause the anti-apoptotic effect by inhibiting the caspases and thus inhibiting apoptosis. As an example, human X-chromosome linked 1AP (XIAP) inhibits caspase 3, caspase 7 and the Apaf-1-cytochrome C mediated activation of caspase 9 (Deveraux et al., (1998) EMBO J. 17, 2215-2223). Caspases 3 and 7 are inhibited by the BIR2 domain of XIAP, while the BIR3 domain of XIAP is responsible for the inhibition of<br>
caspase 9 activity. X1AP is expressed ubiquitously in most adult and fetal tissues (Liston et al, Nature, 1996, 379(6563):349), and is overexpressed in a number of tumor cell lines of the NCI 60 cell line panel (Fong et al, Genomics, 2000, 70:113; Tamm et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 2000, 6(5): 1796). Overexpression of X1AP in tumor cells has been demonstrated to confer protection against a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli and promotes resistance to chemotherapy (LaCasse et al, Oncogene, 1998, 17(25):3247). Consistent with this, a strong correlation between XIAP protein levels and survival has been demonstrated for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (Tamm et al, supra). Down-regulation of XIAP expression by antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to death induced by a wide range of pro-apoptotic agents, both in vitro and in vivo (Sasaki et al, Cancer Res., 2000, 60(20):5659; Lin et al, Biochem J., 2001, 353:299; Hu et al, Clin. Cancer Res., 2003, 9(7):2826). Smac/DIABLO-derived peptides have also been demonstrated to sensitize a number of different tumor cell lines to apoptosis induced by a variety of pro-apoptotic drugs (Arnt et al, J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277(46):44236; Fulda et al, Nature Med., 2002, 8(8):808; Quo et al, Blood,2002, 99(9):3419; Vucic et al, J. Biol. Chem.,2002, 277(14): 12275; Yang et al, Cancer Res., 2003, 63(4):831).<br>
Melanoma IAP (ML-lAP) is an IAP not detectable in most normal adult tissues but is strongly upregulated in melanoma (Vucic et al., (2000) Current Bio 10:1359-1366). Determination of protein structure demonstrated significant homology of the ML-IAP BIR and RING finger domains to corresponding domains present in human XIAP, C-IAP1 and C-IAP2. The BIR domain of ML-IAP appears to have the most similarities to the B1R2 and BIR3 of XIAP, C-IAP1 and C-IAP2, and appears to be responsible for the inhibition of apoptosis, as determined by deletional analysis. Furthermore, Vucic et al., demonstrated that ML-IAP could inhibit chemotherapeutic agent induced apoptosis. Agents such as adriamycin and 4-tertiary butylphenol (4-TBP) were tested in a cell culture system of melanomas overexpressing ML-IAP and the chemotherapeutic agents were significantly less effective in killing the cells when compared to a normal melanocyte control. The mechanism by which ML-IAP produces an anti-apoptotic activity is in part through inhibition of caspase 3 and 9. ML-IAP did not effectively inhibit caspases 1, 2, 6, or 8.<br>
Since apoptosis is a strictly controlled pathway with multiple interacting factors, the discovery that lAPs themselves are regulated was not unusual. In the fruit fly Drosophila, the Reaper (rpr), Head Involution Defective (hid) and GRIM proteins physically interact with and inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of the Drosophila family of lAPs. In the mammal, the proteins SMAC/DIABLO act to block the lAPs and allow apoptosis to proceed. It was shown that during normal apoptosis, SMAC is processed into an active form and is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm where it physically binds to lAPs and prevents the IAP from binding to a caspase. This inhibition<br>
of the IAP allows the caspase to remain active and thus proceed with apoptosis. Interestingly, sequence homology between the IAP inhibitors shows that there is a four amino acid motif in the N-terminus of the processed, active proteins. This tetrapeptide appears to bind into a hydrophobic pocket in the BIR domain and disrupts the BIR domain binding to caspases (Chai et al., (2000) Nature 406:855-862, Liu et al., (2000) Nature 408:1004-1008, Wu et al., (2000) Nature 408 1008-1012).<br>

The species of carboxy-protecting group employed is not critical so long as the derivatized carboxylic acid is stable to the condition of subsequent reaction(s) on other positions of the molecule and can be removed at the appropriate point without disrupting the remainder of the molecule. In particular, it is important not to subject a carboxy-protected molecule to strong nucleophilic bases, such as lithium hydroxide or NaOH, or reductive conditions employing highly activated metal hydrides such as LiAlH4. (Such harsh removal<br>
conditions are also to be avoided when removing amino-protecting groups and hydroxy-protecting groups, discussed below.) Preferred carboxylic acid protecting groups are the alkyl (e.g. methyl, ethyl, t-butyl), allyl, benzyl and p-nitrobenzyl groups. Similar carboxy-protecting groups used in the cephalosporin, penicillin and peptide arts can also be used to protect a carboxy group substituents. Further examples of these groups are found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1991, chapter 5; E. Haslam, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", J. G. W. McOmie, Ed., Plenum Press, New York, N.Y., 1973, Chapter 5, and T.W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, 1981, Chapter 5. The term "protected carboxy" refers to a carboxy group substituted with one of the above carboxy-protecting groups.<br>

Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 1991, chapters 2-3; E. Haslam, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", J. G. W. McOmie, Ed., Plenum Press, New York, NY, 1973, Chapter 5, and T.W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, 1981. The term "protected hydroxy" refers to a hydroxy group substituted with one of the above hydroxy-protecting groups.<br>

THF is vacuumed off and the mixture is then subjected to flash chromatography using 50% EtOAc/Hexane to yield the product. The Fmoc-alanine derivative, phosphorus pentasulfide and sodium carbonate are mixed in THF and stirred overnight. The solution is concentrated and direct chromatography using 80% EtOAc/Hexane yields the activated thioalanine.

UTILITY<br>
The compounds of the invention inhibit the binding of IAP proteins to caspases, in particular X-IAP binding interaction with caspases 3 and 7. The compounds also inhibit the binding of ML-IAP to Smac protein. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful for inducing apoptosis in cells or sensitizing cells to apoptotic signals, in particular cancer cells. Compounds of the invention are useful for inducing apoptosis in cells that overexpress IAP proteins. Alternatively, compounds of the invention are useful for inducing apoptosis in cells in which the mitochondria! apoptotic pathway is disrupted such that release of Smac from ML-IAP proteins is inhibited, for example by up regulation of Bcl-2 or down regulation of Bax/Bak. More broadly, the compounds can be used for the treatment of all cancer types which fail to undergo apoptosis.

Most preferred, the cytostatic compound is doxorubicin.<br>
Another class of active compounds which can be used in the present invention are those which are able to sensitize for or induce apoptosis by binding to death receptors ("death receptor agonists"). Such agonists of death receptors include death receptor ligands such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), tumor necrosis factor 6 (TNF-B, lymphotoxin-a) , LT-fi (lymphotoxin-B), TRAIL (Apo2L, DR4 ligand), CD95 (Fas, APO-1) ligand, TRAMP (DR3, Apo-3) ligand, DR6 ligand as well as fragments and derivatives of any of said ligands. Preferably, the death receptor ligand is TNF-a. More preferably the death receptor ligand is Apo2L/TRAIL. Furthermore, death receptors agonists comprise agonistic antibodies to death receptors such as anti-CD95 antibody, anti-TRAIL-Rl (DR4) antibody, anti-TRAIL-R2 (DR5) antibody, anti-TRAIL-R3 antibody, anti-TRAIL-R4 antibody, anti-DR6 antibody, anti-TNF-Rl antibody and anti-TRAMP (DR3) antibody as well as fragments and derivatives of any of said antibodies.<br>
For the purpose of sensitizing cells for apoptosis, the compounds of the present invention can be also used in combination with radiation therapy. The phrase "radiation therapy" refers to the use of electromagnetic or particulate radiation in the treatment of neoplasia. Radiation therapy is based on the principle that high-dose radiation delivered to a target area will result in the death of reproducing cells in both tumor and normal tissues. The radiation dosage regimen is generally defined in terms of radiation absorbed dose (rad), time and fractionation, and must be carefully defined by the oncologist. The amount of radiation a patient receives will depend on various consideration but the two most important considerations are the location of the tumor in relation to<br>
other critical structures or organs of the body, and the extent to which the tumor has spread. Examples of radiotherapeutic agents are provided in, but not limited to, radiation therapy and is known in the art (Hellman, Principles of Radiation Therapy, Cancer, in Principles I and Practice of Oncology, 24875 (Devita et al., 4th ed., vol 1, 1993). Recent advances in radiation therapy include three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy (interstitial radiation therapy), the latter placing the source of radiation directly into the tumor as implanted "seeds". These newer treatment modalities deliver greater doses of radiation to the tumor, which accounts for their increased effectiveness when compared to standard external beam radiation therapy.<br>
Ionizing radiation with beta-emitting radionuclides is considered the most useful for radiotherapeutic applications because of the moderate linear energy transfer (LET) of the ionizing particle (electron) and its intermediate range (typically several millimeters in tissue). Gamma rays deliver dosage at lower levels over much greater distances. Alpha particles represent the other extreme, they deliver very high LET dosage, but have an extremely limited range and must, therefore, be in intimate contact with the cells of the tissue to be treated. In addition, alpha emitters are generally heavy metals, which limits the possible chemistry and presents undue hazards from leakage of radionuclide from the area to be treated. Depending on the tumor to be treated all kinds of emitters are conceivable within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention encompasses types of non-ionizing radiation like e.g. ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high energy visible light, microwave radiation (hyperthermia therapy), infrared (IR) radiation and lasers. In a particular embodiment of the present invention UV radiation is applied.<br>
The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of the invention and a therapeutically inert carrier, diluent or excipient, as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. Typically, the compounds of formula I used in the methods of the invention are formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.<br>
The inhibitory compound for use herein is preferably sterile. The compound ordinarily will be stored as a solid composition, although lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions are acceptable.<br>
The composition of the invention will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The "effective amount" of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit LAP interaction with caspases, induce apoptosis or sensitize a malignant cell to an apoptotic signal. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the mammal as a whole.<br>
Generally, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound of the invention administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. Oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, preferably contain from about 25 to about 1000 mg of the compound of the invention.<br>
The compound of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. An example of a suitable oral dosage form is a tablet containing about 25mg, 50mg, lOOmg, 250mg, or 500mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30 mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40 mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1-10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound, for example 5-400 mg, of the invention in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such sodium chloride, if desired. The solution is typically filtered, e.g. using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants.<br>

Example 78      IAP inhibition assays<br>
In the following experiments was used a chimeric BIR domain referred to as MLXBIR3SG in which 11 of 110 residues correspond to those found in XIAP-BIR3, while the remainder correspond to ML-IAP-B1R. The chimeric protein MLXB1R3SG was shown to bind and inhibit<br>
caspase-9 significantly better than either of the native BIR domains, but bound Smac-based peptides and mature Smac with affinities similar to those of native ML-IAP-BIR. The improved caspase-9 inhibition of the chimeric BIR domain MLXBIR3SG has been correlated with increased inhibition of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis when transfected into MCF7 cells.<br>

A reagent cocktail containing 300 nM his-tagged MLXBIR3SG; 200 nM biotinylated SMAC peptide (AVP1); 5 ug/mL anti-his allophycocyanin (XL665) (CISBio International); and 200 ng/mL streptavidin-europium (Perkin Elmer) was prepared in reagent buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine globulins, 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside). (Alternatively, this cocktail can be made using europium-labeled anti-His (Perkin Elmer) and streptavidin-allophycocyanin (Perkin Elmer) at concentrations of 6.5 nM and 25nM, respectively). The reagent cocktail was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cocktail was added to 1:3 serial dilutions of an antagonist compound (starting concentration of 50 uM) in 384-well black F1A plates (Greiner Bio-One, Inc.). After a 90 minute incubation at room temperature, the fluorescence was read with filters for the excitation of europium (340 nm) and for the emission wavelengths of europium (615 nm) and a allophycocyanin (665 nm). Antagonist data were calculated as a ratio of the emission signal of allophycocyanin at 665 nm to that of the emission of europium at 615 nm (these ratios were multiplied by a factor of 10,000 for ease of data manipulation). The resulting values were plotted as a function of antagonist concentration and fit to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Indications of antagonist potency were determined from the IC50 values. Compounds of the invention where found to have IAP inhibitory activity which was demonstrated in this assay.<br>
Fluorescence Polarization Peptide Binding Assay<br>
Polarization experiments were performed on an Analyst HT 96-384 (Molecular Devices Corp.) according to the procedure of Keating, S.M., Marsters, J, Beresini, M, Ladner, C, Zioncheck, K., Clark, K., Arellano, F., and Bodary., S.(2000) in Proceedings of SPIE : In Vitro Diagnostic Instrumentation (Cohn, G.E., Ed.) pp 128-137, Bellingham, WA. Samples for fluorescence polarization affinity measurements were prepared by addition of 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a final concentration of 5)iM of MLXBIR3SG in polarization buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 1% bovine globulins 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside) to 5-carboxyflourescein-conjugated AVPdi-Phe-NH2 (AVP-diPhe-FAM) at 5 nM final concentration.<br>

AVP-diPhe-FAM probe<br>
The reactions were read after an incubation time of 10 minutes at room temperature with standard cut-off filters for the fluorescein fluorophore (^ = 485 nm.; Xem = 530 nm) in 96-well black HE96 plates (Molecular Devices Corp.). Fluorescence values were plotted as a function of the protein concentration, and the IC50s were obtained by fitting the data to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy software, Reading, PA). Competition experiments were performed by addition of the MLXBIR3SG at 30 nM to wells containing 5 nM of the AVP-diPhe-FAM probe as well as 1:3 serial dilutions of antagonist compounds starting at a concentration of 300 uM in the polarization buffer. Samples were read after a 10-minute incubation. Fluorescence polarization values were plotted as a function of the antagonist concentration, and the 1C50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy software, Reading, PA). Inhibition constants (K\) for the antagonists were determined from the ICso values. Compounds of the invention where found to have IAP inhibitory activity which was demonstrated in this assay.<br><br><br><br><br>
