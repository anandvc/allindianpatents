				<td>PYRROLO-TRIAZINE ANILINE COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to pyrrolotriazine compounds, more particularly, to cycloalkyl, heterocyclo and heteroaryl pyrrolotriazine aniline compounds useful for treating p38 kinase-associated conditions. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention useful for treating p38 kinase-associated conditions and methods of inhibiting the activity of p38 kinase in a mammal.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
'••,,       -	'	'	',;'•*,'<br>
A large number of cytokines participate in the inflammatory response, including IL-1, BL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a. Overproduction of cytokines such as 1L-1 and TNF-a are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, endotoxin shock, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and congestive heart failure, among others [Henry et al, Drugs Put., 24:1345-1354 (1999); Salituro et al, Curr. Med. Chem.. 6:807-823 (1999)]. Evidence in human patients indicates that protein antagonists of cytokines are effective in treating chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, for example, monoclonal antibody to TNF-a (Enbrel) [Rankin et al, Br. J. Rheumatol.. 34:334-342 (1995)], and soluble TNF-a receptor-Fc fusion protein (Etanercept) [Moreland et al., Ann. Intern. Med., 130:478-486 (1999)1.<br>
The biosynthesis of TNF-a occurs in many cell types in response to an external stimulus, such as, for example, a mitogen, an infectious organism, or trauma. Important mediators of TNF-a production are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and in particular, p38 kinase. These kinases are activated in response to various stress stimuli, including but not limited to proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxin, ultraviolet light, and osmotic shock. Activation of p38 requires dual phosphorylation by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) on threonine and tyrosine within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif characteristic of p38 isozymes.<br>
There are four known isoforms of p38, i.e., p38-oc, p38{3, p38y, and p385. The a and (3 isoforms are expressed in inflammatory cells and are key mediators of TNF-a production. Inhibiting the p38a and |3 enzymes in cells results in reduced levels of TNF-a expression. Also, administering p38a and J3 inhibitors in animal models of inflammatory disease has proven that such inhibitors are effective in treating those diseases. Accordingly, the p38 enzymes serve an important role in inflammatory processes mediated by IL-1 and TNF-a. Compounds that reportedly inhibit p38 kinase and cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a for use in treating inflammatory diseases are disclosed in US Pats. Nos. 6,277,989 and 6,130,235 to Scios, Inc; US Pats. Nos. 6,147,080 and 5,945,418 to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc; US Pats Nos. 6,251,914,5,977,103 and 5,658,903 to Smith-Kline Beecham Corp.; US Pats.

The fused rings completing the bicyclic and tricyclic groups may contain only carbon atoms and may be saturated, partially saturated, or unsaturated. The nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen atoms may optionally be quaternized. Heteroaryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic. The heteroaryl group may be attached at any available nitrogen or carbon atom of any ring. It may optionally be substituted with one to three (preferably 0 to 2) Rc groups, as defined above for aryl, which in turn may be substituted with one or more (preferably o to 2) Rd groups, also as recited above.<br>

Each ring of the heterocyclic group containing a heteroatom may have 1,2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, where the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms also optionally may be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatoms also optionally may be quaternized. Preferably two adjacent heteroatoms are not simultaneously selected from oxygen and<br>
nitrogen. The heterocyclic group may be attached at any nitrogen or carbon atom.

Utility<br>
The compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of p38 kinase activity, and in particular, isoforms p38a and p38{3. Accordingly, compounds of formula (I) have utility in treating conditions associated with p38 kinase activity. Such conditions include diseases in which cytokine levels are modulated as a consequence of intracellular signaling via p38, and in particular, diseases that are associated with an overproduction of cytokines IL-1, IL-4, IL-8, and TNF-a. As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" encompass either or both responsive and prophylaxis measures, e.g., measures designed to inhibit or delay the onset of the disease or disorder, achieve a full or partial reduction of the symptoms or disease state, and/or to<br>
alleviate, ameliorate, lessen, or cure the disease or disorder and/or its symptoms. When reference is made herein to inhibition of "p-38on$ kinase," this means that either p38a and/or p38|3 kinase are inhibited. Thus, reference to an ICso value for inhibiting p-38o&amp;'p kinase means that the compound has such effectiveness for inhibiting at least one of, or both of, p38a and p380 kinases.<br>
Li view of their activity as inhibitors ofp-38a/$ kinase, compounds of Formula (I) are useful in treating p-38 associated conditions including, but not limited to, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, angiogenic disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral diseases.<br>
More particularly, the specific conditions or diseases that may be treated with the inventive compounds include, without limitation, pancreatitis (acute or chronic), asthma, allergies, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma, chronic thyroiditis, Grave's disease, autoimmune gastritis, diabetes, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, atopic dermatitis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, graft vs. host disease, inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, cachexia, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, acute synovitis, pancreatic (3-cell disease; diseases characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration; rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption disease, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, cachexia secondary to infection, meloid formation, scar tissue formation, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, influenza, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma-related bone disorder, icute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, metastatic melanoma, fCaposi's sarcoma, multiple myeloma, sepsis, septic shock, and Shigellosis; Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemias or neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury; angiogenic disorders including solid tumors,<br>
ocular neovasculization, and infantile haemangiomas; viral diseases including acute hepatitis infection (including hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), HIV infection and CMV retinitis, AIDS, ARC or malignancy, and herpes; stroke, myocardial ischemia, ischemia in stroke heart attacks, organ hyposia, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, thrombosis, cardiac hypertrophy, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, and conditions associated with prostaglandin endoperoxidase syndase-2.<br>
In addition, p38 inhibitors of this invention inhibit the expression of inducible pro-inflammatory proteins such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2), also referred to as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Accordingly, additional p38-associated conditions include edema, analgesia, fever and pain, such as neuromuscular pain, headache, pain caused by cancer, dental pain and arthritis pain.

The effective amount of a compound of the present invention may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes exemplary dosage amounts for a mammal of from about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of active compound per day, which may be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual divided doses, such as from 1 to 4 times per day. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats, horses, and the like. Thus, when the term "patient" is used herein, this term is intended to include all subjects, most preferably mammalian species, that are affected by mediation of p38 enzyme levels.<br>
Compounds of formula (I), including the compounds described in the examples hereof, have been tested in one or more of the assays described below and have shown activity as inhibitors of p38o/|3 enzymes and TNF-a.<br>
Biological Assays Generation of p38 Kinases<br>
cDNAs of human p38cc, (3 and yisozymes were cloned by PCR. These cDNAs were subcloned in the pGEX expression vector (Pharmacia). GST-p38 fusion protein<br>
was expressed in E. Coli and purified from bacterial pellets by affinity chromatography using glutathione agarose. p38 fusion protein was activated by incubating with constitutivery active MKK6. Active p38 was separated from MKK6 by affinity chromatography. Constitutivery active MKK6 was generated according to Raingeaud etal. [Mol. Cell. Biol., 1247-1255 (1996)]. TNF-q Production by LPS-StimuIated PBMCs<br>
Heparinized human whole blood was obtained from healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from human whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended at a concentration of 5 x 106/ml in assay medium (RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum). 50 ul of cell suspension was incubated with 50 ul of test compound (4X concentration in assay medium containing 0.2% DMSO) in 96-well tissue culture plates for 5 minutes at RT. 100 ul of LPS (200 ng/ml stock) was then added to the cell suspension and the plate was incubated for 6 hours at 37°C. Following incubation, the culture medium was collected and stored at -20°C. TNF-a concentration in the medium was quantified using a standard ELISA kit (Pharmingen-San Diego, CA). Concentrations of TNF-a and ICso values for test compounds (concentration of compound that inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-a production by 50%) were calculated by linear regression analysis. p38 Assay<br>
The assays were performed in V-bottomed 96-well plates. The final assay volume was 60 //I prepared from three 20 //I additions of enzyme, substrates (MBP and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2,50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT). Bacterially expressed, activated p38 was pre-incubated with test compounds for 10 min. prior to initiation of reaction with substrates. The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 45 min. and terminated by adding 5 fA of 0.5 M EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was aspirated onto a pre-wet filtermat using a Skatron Micro96 Cell Harvester (Skatron, Inc.), then washed with PBS. The filtermat was then dried in a microwave oven for 1 min., treated with MeltilLex A scintillation wax (Wallac), and counted on a Microbeta scintillation counter Model 1450 (Wallac). Inhibition data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using Prizm (GraphPadSoftware). The final concentration of reagents in the assays<br>
are ATP, 1 /M; [y-33P]ATP, 3 nM,; MBP (Sigma, #M1891), 2//g/well; p38, 10 nM; and DMSO, 0.3%.<br>
TNF-q Production by LPS-Stimulated Mice<br>
Mice (Balb/c female, 6-8 weeks of age, Harlan Labs; n=8/treatment group) were injected intraperitoneally with 50ug/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E coli strain 0111:B4, Sigma) suspended in sterile saline. Ninety minutes later, mice were sedated by CC^Oa inhalation and a blood sample was obtained. Serum was separated and analyzed for TNF-alpha concentrations by commercial ELISA assay per the manufacturer's instructions (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).<br>
Test compounds were administered orally at various times before LPS injection. The compounds were dosed either as suspensions or as solutions in various vehicles or solubilizing agents.<br>
