				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION PLASMA CVD APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a plasma CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) apparatus for preparation of a thin film used in various electronic devices such as an amorphous silicon solar cell, a microcrystalline solar cell, a thin film polycrystalline solar cell, a thin film semiconductor device, an optical sensor, and a semiconductor protective film.<br>
Various plasma CVD apparatuses are used for preparation of an amorphous silicon (hereinafter referred to as "a-Si") thin film, a microcrystalline thin film, a polycrystalline thin film, or a silicon nitride (hereinafter referred to as SiNx") thin film. The conventional plasma CVD apparatus can be classified typically into a type in which is used a ladder-shaped electrode for discharge generation and another type in which are used plate electrodes arranged in parallel. The ladder-shaped electrode includes, for example, a ladder-antenna electrode, a ladder inductance electrode and a ladder-shaped plane coil electrode.<br>
Japanese Patent Disclosure (Kokai) No. 4-236781 discloses a plasma CVD apparatus using a ladder-shaped electrode of various shapes.  FIG. 12 shows a typical example of the plasma CVD apparatus disclosed in JP '781 quoted above.  As shown in the drawing, a<br><br>
ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation and a heater 3 for heating a substrate are arranged in parallel within a reaction vessel 1.  A high frequency power having a frequency of, for example, 13.56 MHz is supplied from a high frequency power source 4 to the ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation through an impedance matching device 5.  As shown in FIG. 13, the ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation is connected at one end to the high frequency power source 4 via the impedance matching device 5 and is also connected at the other end to a ground wire 7 and, thus, to the ground.  Also, the reaction vessel 1 is connected to the ground.<br>
The high frequency power supplied to the ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation serves to generate a glow discharge plasma in a free space between the substrate heater 3, which is also connected to the ground together with the reaction vessel 1, and ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation. After generation of the glow discharge plasma, the high frequency power flows through the discharge space into the wall of the reaction vessel 1 and into the ground through the ground wire 7 connected to the ladder-shaped electrode 2.  A coaxial cable is used as the ground wire 7.<br>
A mixed gas consisting of, for example, monosilane and hydrogen is supplied from a bomb (not shown) into<br><br>
the reaction vessel 1 through a reactant gas introducing pipe 8.  The reactant gas introduced into the reaction vessel 1 is decomposed by a glow discharge plasma generated by the ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation so as to be deposited on a substrate 9 disposed on the heater 3 and heated to a predetermined temperature.  On the other hand, the gas within the reaction vessel 1 is exhausted by a vacuum pump 11 through an exhaust pipe 10.<br>
In preparing a thin film by using the apparatus described above, the inner space of the reaction vessel 1 is exhausted first by operating the vacuum pump 11, followed by introducing a mixed gas consisting of, for example, monosilane and hydrogen into the reaction vessel 1 through the reactant gas introducing pipe 8. In this step, the inner pressure of the reaction vessel 1 is maintained at 0.05 to 0.5 Torr.  Under this condition, a high frequency power is supplied from the high frequency power source 4 to the ladder-shaped electrode 2 for discharge generation so as to generate a glow discharge plasma.  Therefore, the reactant gas is decomposed by the glow discharge plasma generated in the free space between the ladder-shaped electrode 2 and the substrate heater 3 so as to generate Si-containing radicals SiH3, and SiH2.  These radicals are attached to a surface of the substrate 9 so as to form an a-Si thin film.<br><br>
FIG. 14 shows another type of the conventional plasma CVD apparatus in which are used plate electrodes arranged in parallel.  As shown in the drawing, the apparatus comprises a reaction vessel 21.  A high frequency electrode 22 and a substrate heater 23 are arranged in parallel within the reaction vessel 21.  A high frequency having a frequency of, for example, 13.56 MHz is supplied from a high frequency power source 24 to the high frequency electrode 22 through an impedance matching device 25.  The substrate heater 23 is connected to the reaction vessel 21.  Also, the reaction vessel 21 is connected to the ground.  It follows that the substrate heater 23 is indirectly connected to the ground to constitute a ground electrode, with the result that a glow discharge plasma is generated in the free space between the high frequency electrode 22 and the substrate heater 23.<br>
A mixed gas consisting of, for example, monosilane and hydrogen is supplied from a bomb (not shown) into the reaction vessel 21 through a reactant gas introducing pipe 26.  On the other hand, the gas within the reaction vessel 21 is exhausted by a vacuum pump 28 through an exhaust pipe 27.  A substrate 29 is disposed on the substrate heater 23 so as to be heated to a predetermined temperature.<br>
For forming a thin film by using the apparatus shown in FIG. 14, the inner space of the reaction<br><br>
vessel 21 is exhausted first by operating the vacuum pump 28, followed by introducing a mixed gas consisting of, for example, monosilane and hydrogen into the reaction vessel 21 through the reactant gas introducing pipe 26.  In this step, the inner pressure of the reaction vessel 1 is maintained at 0.05 to 0.5 Torr. If a high frequency power is supplied from the high frequency power source 24 to the high frequency electrode 22, a glow discharge plasma is generated within the reaction vessel.<br>
The monosilane gas contained in the mixed gas supplied through the reactant gas introducing pipe 26 into the reaction vessel 21 is decomposed by the glow discharge plasma generated in the free space between the high frequency electrode 22 and the substrate heater 23 so as to generate Si-containing radicals such as SiH3 and SiH2•  These Si-containing radicals are attached to a surface of the substrate 29 so as to form an a-Si thin film.<br>
However, any of the prior arts using a ladder-shaped electrode and plate electrodes arranged in parallel gives rise to problems as described below.<br>
(1)  In the apparatus shown in FIG. 12, a reactant gas, e.g., SiH4, is decomposed by an electric field generated in the vicinity of the ladder-shaped electrode 2 into Si, SiH, SiH2, SiH3, H, H2, etc. so as to form an a-Si film on the surface of the substrate 9.<br><br>
However, if the frequency of the high frequency power is increased from the present level of 13.56 MHz to 30 to 200 MHz in an attempt to increase the rate of forming the a-Si film, the electric field in the vicinity of the ladder-shaped electrode fails to be distributed uniformly, leading to a markedly poor uniformity in the thickness of the formed a-Si film. FIG. 15 is a graph showing the relationship between the plasma power source frequency and the film thickness distribution in respect of a substrate having an area of 30 cm x 30 cm.  It should be noted that the size of the substrate which permits ensuring a uniformity in the film thickness distribution, i.e., deviation of ±10% from an average film thickness, is 5 cm x 5 cm to 20 cm x 20 cm.<br>
The reason why it is difficult to increase the frequency of the high frequency power source 4 in the apparatus using a ladder-shaped electrode is as follows. Specifically, non-uniformity of impedance derived from the construction of the ladder-shaped electrode is inherent in the apparatus shown in FIG. 12, with the result that a strong plasma light emission is localized, as shown in FIG. 16.  For example, a strong plasma is generated in a peripheral portion alone of the ladder-shaped electrode, and is not generated in a central portion.  The difference in the plasma density between the peripheral portion and the central portion of the<br><br>
ladder-shaped electrode is rendered prominent particularly where the frequency of the high frequency power source is increased to 60 MHz or more.<br>
Under the circumstances, it is very difficult and considered substantially impossible to increase the film forming rate by increasing the frequency of the plasma power source when it comes to a large substrate required for improving the mass productivity and cost reduction.  It should be noted that the film forming rate of a-Si is proportional to the square of the frequency of the plasma power source.  Therefore, vigorous researches are being made in this technical field on the technology to increase the frequency of the plasma power source.  However, a successful result has not yet been reported in the case of a large substrate.<br>
(2)  In the apparatus shown in FIG. 14, a reactant gas, e.g., SiH4, is decomposed by an electric field generated in the free space between the high frequency electrode 22 and the substrate heater 23 into Si, SiH, SiH2, SiH3, H, H2, etc. so as to form an a-Si film on the surface of the substrate 29.  However, if the frequency of the high frequency power is increased from the present level of 13.56 MHz to 30 to 200 MHz in an attempt to increase the rate of forming the a-Si film, the electric field generated in the free space between the high frequency electrode 22 and the substrate<br><br>
heater 23 fails to be distributed uniformly, leading to a markedly poor uniformity in the thickness of the formed a-Si film.  FIG. 15 is a graph showing the relationship between the plasma power source frequency and the film thickness distribution in respect of a substrate having an area of 30 cm x 30 cm.  It should be noted that the size of the substrate which permits ensuring a uniformity in the film thickness distribution, i.e., deviation of ±10% from an average film thickness, is 5 cm x 5 cm to 20 cm x 20 cm.<br>
The reason why it is difficult to increase the frequency of the high frequency power source 24 in the apparatus using plate electrodes arranged in parallel is as follows.  Specifically, the peripheral portion and the central portion of the parallel plate type electrodes differ from each other in the electrical characteristics, with the result that a strong plasma is generated in the peripheral portions of the parallel electrodes 22 and 23 as shown in FIG. 17A, or a strong plasma is generated in the central portion alone of the parallel electrodes 22 and 23 as shown in FIG. 17B.<br>
Under the circumstances, it is very difficult and considered substantially impossible to increase the film forming rate by increasing the frequency of the plasma power source when it comes to a large substrate required for improving the mass productivity and cost reduction.  It should be noted that the film forming<br><br>
rate of a-Si is proportional to the square of the frequency of the plasma power source.  Therefore, vigorous researches are being made in this technical field on the technology to increase the frequency of the plasma power source.  However, a successful result has not yet been reported in the case of a large substrate.<br>
It has also been found that, if the ground wire 7 is connected to the ladder-shaped electrode 2 as shown in FIG. 12, the generated plasma is weakened at the junction between the ground wire 7 and the ladder-shaped electrode 2, leading to reduction in the film forming rate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the present invention, a power supply terminal for supplying a high frequency power to a ladder-shaped electrode is formed at the junction between the ladder-shaped electrode and a coaxial cable used for supplying a high frequency power to the ladder-shaped electrode. It is desirable to form at least four power supply terminals at peripheral portions of the ladder-shaped electrode.  To be more specific, it is desirable to form at least two power supply terminals at any of the upper, lower, right and left sides of the ladder-shaped electrode.  For example, two power supply terminals should be formed at each of the upper and lower sides of the ladder-shaped electrode, totaling four power supply terminals.  Alternatively, four power supply terminals should be formed at each of the right and left sides of the ladder-shaped electrode, totaling eight power supply terminals.<br>
In the present invention, the frequency of the power source should fall within a range of between 30 MHz and 150 MHz.<br>
In the present invention, a power supply line connecting the ladder-shaped electrode for discharge generation and the power source is formed of a coaxial cable.  Also, the ladder-shaped electrode is not connected to the ground through a ground wire.  Because of the particular construction, the plasma CVD<br>
apparatus of the present invention makes it possible to prevent a film forming rate from being lowered.  It should be noted that the ladder-shaped electrode used in the present invention can be classified into a ladder-antenna electrode and a ladder-shaped plan coil electrode.<br>
In the plasma CVD apparatus of the present invention, power supply terminals which are formed at the junctions between the ladder-shaped electrode and coaxial cables are positioned at peripheral portions of the ladder-shaped electrode.  Also, at least four power supply terminals are formed in the ladder-shaped electrode.  The particular construction makes it possible to obtain a satisfactory film thickness distribution, compared with the prior art.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 collectively show a plasma CVD apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein FIG. 1 shows the entire construction of the apparatus, and FIG. 2 shows the electrical wiring for supplying a high frequency power to the ladder-shaped electrode included in the apparatus shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in the drawings, the plasma CVD apparatus of the present invention comprises a reaction vessel 31. Arranged within the reaction vessel 31 are a discharge electrode (a ladder-shaped electrode) 32 for generating a glow discharge plasma, and a heater 34 supporting a<br><br>
substrate 33 used as a workpiece for controlling the temperature of the substrate 33.  The discharge electrode 32 is sized at width 572 mm x length 572 mm and made of a SUS rod having a diameter of 6 mm.  The distance between the centers of the adjacent SUS rods is 26 mm.<br>
A high frequency power source 36 is connected to the discharge electrode 32 via an impedance matching device 35.  An electric power having a frequency of, for example, 13.56 MHz to 200 MHz is supplied from the high frequency power source 36 to the discharge electrode 32.  A reactant gas introducing pipe 37 having a reactant gas discharge port 37a is arranged within the reaction vessel 31 for introducing a reactant gas to a region around the discharge electrode 32.  Also, a vacuum pump 39 for discharging the waste gas from within the reaction vessel 31 is connected to the reaction vessel 31 via an exhaust pipe 38.<br>
An earth shield 40 is arranged within the reaction vessel 31.  The earth shield 40 serves to suppress the discharge generation in undesired portions.  Also, since the earth shield 40 is used in combination with the exhaust pipe 38 and the vacuum pump 39, the earth shield 40 permits the reactant gas and other formed products to be discharged to the outside through the exhaust pipe 38 after the reactant gas such as SiH4 introduced through the reactant gas introducing pipe 37<br><br>
into the reaction vessel is converted into a plasma by the electrode 32 for discharge generation.  Incidentally, the pressure within the reaction vessel 31 is monitored by a pressure gage (not shown) and controlled by adjusting the exhaust rate of the vacuum pump 39.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, four power-supply terminals 41, 42, 43, 44 are welded to the upper side of the discharge electrode 32.  Also, four additional power supply terminals 45, 46, 47, 48 are welded to the lower side of the discharge electrode 32.  Four Current introducing terminals 49, 50, 51, 52 each having two pins are arranged between the discharge electrode 32 and the impedance matching device 35.  In this embodiment, a high frequency power having a frequency of, for example, 60 MHz or 80 MHz is supplied from the high frequency power source 36 to the power supply terminals 41 to 48 through the impedance matching device 35, eight coaxial cables 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, the current introducing terminals 49 to 52, and eight coaxial cables 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60 connected to the power supply terminals 41 to 48.  In the present invention, it is necessary to use at least four power supply terminals.  Also, a ground wire is not connected to the power supply terminals.<br>
FIGS. 3 to 8 show various ladder-shaped discharge electrodes differing from each other in the position and the number of power supply terminals.  Specifically,<br><br>
FIG. 3 shows that a single power supply terminal 32a is formed in a central portion of the upper side of the discharge electrode 32 together with another single power supply terminal 32b formed in a central portion of the lower side of the discharge electrode 32, totaling two power supply terminals 32a and 32b. FIG. 4 shows that two power supply terminals 32a, 32b are formed apart from each other on the left side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the left side of the discharge electrode 32 is equidistantly divided into three sections by these power supply terminals 32a, 32b.  Likewise, two power supply terminals 32c, 32d are formed apart from each other on the right side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the right side of the discharge electrode 32 is equidistantly divided into three sections by these power supply terminals 32c, 32d. In short, four power supply terminals 32a, 32b, 32c, 32d are formed in the discharge electrode 32 in the arrangement shown in FIG. 4.  FIG. 5 shows that two power supply terminals 32a, 32b are formed apart from each other on the upper side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the upper side of the discharge electrode 32 is equidistantly divided into three sections by these power supply terminals 32a, 32b.  Likewise, two power supply terminals 32c, 32d are formed apart from each other on the lower side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the lower side of the discharge electrode<br><br><br>
32 is equidistantly divided into three sections by these power supply terminals 32c, 32d.  In short, four power supply terminals 32a, 32b, 32c, 32d are formed in the discharge electrode 32 in the arrangement shown in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 6 shows that four power supply terminals 32a, 32b, 32c and 32d are formed in the four corner portions of the discharge electrode 32.  FIG. 7 shows that four power supply terminals 32a, 32c, 32e and 32g are formed in the four corner portions of the discharge electrode 32, and that four additional power supply terminals 32b, 32d, 32f and 32h are formed in the central portions of the upper side, left side, lower side and right side of the discharge electrode 32, totaling eight power supply terminals.  FIG. 8 shows that four power supply terminals 32a, 32b, 32e and 32f are formed in the four corner portions of the discharge electrode 32, that two additional power supply terminals 32c and 32d are formed apart from each other on the left side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the left side is equidistantly divided by these power supply terminals 32c, 32d into three sections, and that two additional power supply terminals 32g and 32h are formed apart from each other on the right side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the right side is equidistantly divided by these power supply terminals 32g, 32h into three sections.  Further, FIG. 9 shows that four power<br><br>
supply terminals 32a, 32d, 32e and 32b are formed in the four corner portions of the discharge electrode 32, that two additional power supply terminals 32b and 32c are formed apart from each other on the upper side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the upper side is equidistantly divided by these power supply terminals 32b, 32c into three sections, and that two additional power supply terminals 32f and 32g are formed apart from each other on the lower side of the discharge electrode 32 such that the lower side is equidistantly divided by these power supply terminals 32f, 32g into three sections.<br>
In forming an a-Si film by using the plasma CVD apparatus of the construction described above, a reactant gas of SiH4 is converted into a plasma by the discharge from the discharge electrode 32.  As a result, radicals within the plasma such as SiH3, SiH2, SiH, etc. are diffused so as to be adsorbed on a surface of the substrate 33, leading to deposition of an a-Si film, a microcrystalline Si film or a polycrystalline Si film on the surface of the substrate 33.  Incidentally, it is known to the art that an a-Si film, a micro-crystalline Si film or a polycrystalline Si film can be formed by controlling appropriately the film forming conditions such as the ratio of flow rate of SiH4 to H2, pressure, and plasma generating power.  Therefore, let us describe herein the case where an a-Si film is<br><br>
formed by using a SiH4 gas as a reactant gas.  Needless to say, the plasma CVD apparatus of the present invention can also be used for forming a micro-crystalline Si film or a polycrystalline Si film.<br>
In the first step, the vacuum pump 39 is operated so as to evacuate the reaction vessel 31 to reach a vacuum of 2 to 3 x 10-7 Torr.  Then, a reactant gas, e.g., SiH4 gas is introduced through the reactant gas introducing pipe 37 into the reaction vessel at a flow rate of about 80 to 200 cc/min.  Then, a high frequency power is supplied from the high frequency power source 36 to the discharge electrode 32 through the impedance matching device 35 while keeping the inner pressure of the reaction vessel 31 at 0.05 to 0.1 Torr.  As a result, a glow discharge plasma of SiH4 is generated in the vicinity of the discharge electrode 32.  The generated plasma decomposes the SiH4 gas, leading to formation of an a-Si film on the surface of the substrate 33.  It should be noted that the film forming rate, which is also dependent on the frequency and output power of the high frequency power source 36, is about 0.5 to 3 nm/s.<br>
FIG. 10 is a graph showing the experimental data on the relationship between the film thickness distribution and the number of power supply terminals, covering the case where an a-Si film was formed on Corning #7059, which is a trade name of a glass<br><br>
substrate manufactured by Corning Inc., having a surface area of 40 cm x 50 cm, by using the discharge electrodes shown in FIGS. 3 to 9, with the frequency of the high frequency power source 36 set at 60 MHz.  In these experiments, the SiH4 gas flow rate was set at 700 cc/min, the pressure was set at 0.2 Torr, and the high frequency power was 500W.  As shown in FIG. 10, the film thickness deviation from the average thickness was found to be ±26% in the case where the discharge electrode 32 was provided with two power supply terminals.  On the other hand, the film thickness deviation from the average thickness was found to be only ±14% in the case where the discharge electrode 32 was provided with four power supply terminals, and as small as ±6% in the case where the discharge electrode 32 was provided with eight power supply terminals.<br>
FIG. 11 is a graph showing the experimental data on the relationship between the film thickness distribution and the number of power supply terminals, covering the case where an a-Si film was formed on Corning #7059, which is a trade name of a glass substrate manufactured by Corning Inc., having a surface area of 40 cm x 50 cm, by using the discharge electrodes shown in FIGS. 3 to 9, with the frequency of the high frequency power source 36 set at 80 MHz.  In these experiments, the SiH4 gas flow rate was set at 700 cc/min, the pressure was set at 0.2 Torr, and the<br><br>
high frequency power was 500W.  As shown in FIG. 11, the film thickness deviation from the average thickness was found to be ±30% in the case where the discharge electrode 32 was provided with two power supply terminals.  On the other hand, the film thickness deviation from the average thickness was found to be only ±18% in the case where the discharge electrode 32 was provided with four power supply terminals, and as small as ±8% in the case where the discharge electrode 32 was provided with eight power supply terminals.<br>
In the manufacture of an a-Si solar cell, a thin film transistor, a photosensitive drum, etc., no problem in performance is brought about, if the film thickness distribution falls within a range of ±10% of the average thickness.<br>
As apparent from the experimental data, it was possible to obtain a markedly improved film thickness distribution, compared with the conventional apparatus and method, by forming at least four power supply terminals, more preferably at least eight power supply terminals, in the peripheral portions of a ladder-shaped discharge electrode in each of the cases where the frequency of the high frequency power source was set at 60 MHz and 80 MHz.  Particularly, where the frequency of the high frequency power source 36 was set at 60 MHz, the thickness distribution of the film formed on a substrate having a surface area of<br><br>
40 cm x 50 cm was found to be less than ±10% of the average thickness.  This clearly supports that the present invention produces a prominently high industrial value in terms of productivity and cost reduction in the manufacture of an a-Si solar cell, a liquid crystal display device driven by a thin film transistor (TFT), and an a-Si photosensitive body.<br>
On the other hand, when it comes to a conventional plasma vapor deposition apparatus, the film thickness distribution is quite non-uniform in the case of using a high frequency power source having a frequency of 30 MHz or more, making it difficult to put the conventional plasma vapor deposition apparatus to practical use in the formation of a thin film on a large substrate sized about 30 cm x 30 cm to 50 cm x 50 cm.<br>
Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.  Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.  Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
