				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an aqueous coating composition based on a mixture of a dispersion of an addition polymer and a iridology modifier. Preferably, this aqueous coating composition is mixed with a metallic pigment, such as aluminum, or a pigment, such as a metal oxide-coated mica, so that coatings with a metallic appearance may be obtained. In this way there is obtained a differential light reflection effect referred to as "flop". A problem with costing systems having a metallic appearance is to obtain a high flop as well as a high gloss.<br>
To obtain a high flop, the metallic pigment on application of the coating composition should be and remain well oriented. To obtain a high gloss, the metallic pigment-containing coating is provided with an undigested, so-called dear coat. This system is generally called a "base coat/clear coat" system. In actual practice, the base coat will be sprayed with the clear coat, without prior curing of the base coat ("wet-on-wet"). Since the clear coat usually contains organic solvents, steps should be taken to prevent disorientation of the metallic pigment in the base coat as a result of the base coat being weakened up by the organic solvents in the clear coat ("strike-in").<br><br>
An aqueous base coat composition is known from EP-A-0 038 127, i.e., a<br>
crosslinked core-shell dispersion whereby the shell, when swollen, provides the    <br>
desired  archeological   properties.  The  crosslinking  reduces  the  strike-in.  A<br>
disadvantage to this system, however, is that the coating composition will have<br>
poor film-funning properties, which may manifest itself in poor mechanical<br>
properties.<br><br>
Another aqueous base coat composition is known from EP-A-0 287 144, i.e., a swellabie non-crossing  core-shell dispersion having an amount of (meth)acrylic acid in the shell of 10-60 mole%. Exemplified are sellable non-crossiinked core-shell dispersions having more than 2 wt.% (meth)acrylic acid in 100 parts of the addition polymer. Also in this embodiment a decrease in strike-in is boson/ed.<br>
Both systems disclosed in EP-A-0 038 127 and EP-A-0 287 144 contain in the shell a lot of carfaoxyiic groups, neutralized by an amine to provide the desired archeological properties. However, because of this large amount of salt groups, coatings based on these compositions especially when applied and cured at ambient temperature, show a poor water-resistance.<br>
The present invention now provides an aqueous coating composition which may be used as base coat in a base  coat system, having good mechanical properties, a high flop, a high gloss, practically no strike-in, and a good water-resistance. Due to the fact that higher solid contents can be achieved with the aqueous coating composition of the present invention, a reduction in drying times and number of coats is obtained. In one or more of these properties the aqueous coating composition of the present invention shows improvement over those disclosed in EP-A-0 038 127 and EP-A-0 287 144.<br>

Prefered is the ammonium or sodium sulphate salt of the adduct of 1 mole C12.14 alcohol and 3-12 moles of ethylene oxide.<br>
Also, in emulsion polymerization, the conventional radical initiators may be used in the usual amounts. Examples of suitable radical initiators include water-soluble initiators, such as ammonium persulphate, sodium persulphate, potassium persulphate, and t-butyl hydroperoxide, and water-insoluble initiators, such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) peroxydicarbonate, di-n-butyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl perpivalate, cumene hydroperoxide, dibenzoyi peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, 2,2"-azobisisobutyronitrile, and 2,2"-azobis-2-methylbutyronitrile.

Optionally, a chain length regulator, for instance n-octyl mercaptan, dodecyl mercaptan, and 3-mercaptopropionic acid, may also be used.<br>
Copolymerization of the monomer mixtures generally is earned out at atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 40-100 °C, preferably 60 - 90 °C, in an atmosphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Optionally, however, copolymerization may also be canied out at elevated pressure. The reaction conditions for monomer mixtures A and B should however be chosen in such manner that functional groups present in the monomer mixtures other than the unsaturated bonds cannot react with each other.<br><br>
According to the invention the carboxylic acid groups derived from the acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid are at least 40-100% neutralized by the addition of a neutralizing agent. As suitable neutralizing agents for the carboxylic acid may be mentioned ammonia and amines such as N,N-dimethyl ethanol amine, N,N-diethyl ethanol amine, 2-{dimethyl)-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, triethyi amine, and morpholine. It is preferred that the neutralizing of the carboxylic acid groups should be carried out after the polymerization.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention comprises preferably a mixture of 92-95 wt.% of a filmforming binder composition comprising an alkali non-swellable core-shell addition polymer dispersion (I), and 5-7.5 wt.% of a rtieology modifying addition polymer dispersion (II).<br>
The coating composition of the present invention consists essentially of water, being an aqueous coating composition. However, about 20 wt.% of liquid content of the coating composition may be an organic solvent. As suitable organic solvents may be mentioned such ether group-containing alcohols as hexylglycol, butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-propapol-2, 1-ethoxy-propanol-2, 1-propoxy-propanol-2, 1-butoxy-propanol-2, and 1-isobutoxy-propanGl-2; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, and hexanol; diols, such as ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol.<br>
The coating composition according to the present invention may be cured by physical drying. Alternatively, however, the coating compositions may be cured in the presence of a curing agent which reacts with hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups.<br>
Examples of suitable curing agents include N-methylol and/or N-methyiol ether groups-containing aminoplastes obtained by reacting an aldehyde, for instance<br><br>
formaldehyde, with an amino or amido groups-containing compound such as melamine, such as Cymei 328, ex Cytec, urea, N,N"-ethylene urea, dicyanodiamide, and benzoguanamine. The resulting compounds are areferably wholly or partially etherified with alcohols having 1-6 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol. isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, amyl alcohol, hexanol, or mixtures thereof. Especially favourable results may be Dbtained when using a methylol melamine having 4-6 methyl groups per molecule of melamine, at least 3 methylol groups being etherified with butanol ar a butanol etherified condensation product of formaldehyde and N,N"-ethyiene diurea. Examples of other suitable curing agents include polyisocyanates or water-dispersible blocked polyisocyanate such as a methyl ethyl ketoxime-biocked, isocyanate group-containing adduct of a polyisocyanate to a hydroxycarboxylic acid, e.g. dimethylol propionic acid, and aliphatic or aromatic carbodiimides.<br>
In addition to the alkali non-swellable core-shell addition polymer dispersion (I), the fiimforming binder composition may also comprise water-dilutable materials such as alkyd resins, polyesters, polyurethanes, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the water dilutable material is a" polyurethane. The filmfomning binder composition may comprise 0,1 to 100 wt.% of the alkali non-swellable core-shell addition polymer dispersion (I) and 99,9 to 0 wt.% of at least one water dilutable material, wherein the sum of the wt.% indicated for dispersion (1) and the water dilutable material(s) is always 100 wt.%. More preferably, the filmfomning binder composition may comprise 1 to 99 wt.% of the alkali non-swellable core-shell addition polymer dispersion (!) and 99 to 1 wt.% of at least one water dilutable material. Most preferably, the fiimforming binder composition may comprise 25 to 75 wt.% of the alkali non-swellable core-shell addition polymer dispersion (I) and 75 to 25 wt.% of at least one water dilutable material.<br><br>
In addition, the coating composition may contain the conventional additives and adjuvants, such as pigments, dispersing agents, dyes, and accelerators for the curing reaction. The applicable pigments may have an acid, a neutral or a basic character. Optionally, the pigments may be pre-treated to modify the properties. Examples of suitable pigments include metallic pigments such as aluminum and stainless steel; nacreous pigments, such as mica coated with a, metal oxide such as iron oxide and/or titanium dioxide; inorganic pigments, such as titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carbon black, silica, kaolin, talc, barium sulphate, lead silicate, strontium chromate, and chromium oxide; and organic pigments, such as phthalocyanine pigments.<br>
The solids content of the coating composition ranges from 5-60 wt.%, preferably from 10-40 wt.%. This depends on whether a metallic pigment is used or not. The presence of metallic pigments results in a lower solid content compared to the presence of non-metallic pigments. However, compared to conventional aqueous base coat systems, the solid content of the coating composition of the present invention is in both cases higher.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition according to the present invention is used as a base coat in a so-called base coat/clear coat system to provide a high gloss metallic appearance. To this end the coating composition according to the invention comprises so-called "non-leafing" aluminum paste or some other metallic pigment. Use of the coating compositions according to the invention as a base coat may prevent the base coat from being softened by the clear coat after being sprayed with it, so that the metallic effect will not be lost.<br>
The clear coat used in the base coat/clear coat system may for instance be a clear baking lacquer of a conventional polyacrylate/melamine composition. The clear     coat      may      also      be      a      two-component      polyester     or<br><br>
polyacrylate/polyisocyanate composition. The polyisocyanate may be for example the trimerof 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention may be applied to a substrate in any desirable manner, such as by roller coating, spraying, brushing, sprinkling, flow coating, dipping, electrostatic spraying, or electrophoresis, preferably by spraying.<br>
Suitable substrates may be made of wood, metal, and synthetic material. Curing may be earned out at ambient temperature or, optionally, at elevated temperature to reduce the curing time. Optionally, the coating composition may be baked at higher temperatures in the range of, for instance, 60 to 160 "C, in a baking oven over a period of 10 to 60 minutes. The clear coat may be applied wet-on-wet on the base coat. Optionally, the base coat may be partially cured prior to the application of the clear coat. Also, the base coat may be fully cured prior to the application of the clear coat.<br>
The compositions are particulariy suitable in the preparation of coated metal<br>
&gt;<br>
substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes. The compositions of the present invention may also be used in the first finishing of automobiles.<br>
The invention will be further described in the following examples, which must not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Test methods used in the examples are described below.<br>
The mean particle size of the dispersions was determined by dynamic light scattering, the dispersion being diluted with water to a solids content of about 0.1 wt.%.<br>
The viscosity was determined with a Braokfield viscometer.<br>
The solids content is detennined in accordance with ASTM method D 1644-59 with heating at 130 "C over a period of 30 minutes.<br>
The metallic-flake orientation can be measured by a spectrogoniometer. The intensity of the reflected light at angle p is measured for a given incident angle a. The so-called flop can be obtained by measurement of the intensity of the reflection (L-value) at two different angles.<br>
Flop=AL = L(p,)-L(P2)<br>
wherein<br>
L(Pi) = intensity of the reflected light at an angle of ± 110"<br>
•-(P2) - intensity of the reflected light at an angle of ± 25" A silver-shaded low solids metallic base coat /clear coat system exhibits a flop-value of approximately 55 to 75 depending on the metallic grade, when measured in this way.<br>
The humidity resistance can be judged visually by the presence of blisters after the test.<br>

Base coat compositions<br>
Examples 14-19 and Comparative Examples A and B Base coat compositions were prepared as follows.<br>
A mixture of<br>
22 g of aluminum paste (65% solids in aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbons, Aquavex Sparkle Silver E5000AR , ex Silberline) and<br>
28 g butoxyethanol was added with stirring to a mixture of<br>
190 g of a polymer dispersion (1) according to Examples 1-6 and 14 g of a polymer dispersion (II) according to Examples 10-12.<br>
The base coat compositions were brought to a pH of 7.5-8.0 by the addition of N,N-dimethyl ethanol amine and diluted with water to spraying viscosity (efflux time of 35 sec. in DIN-cup No. 4). The solids contents of all the base coat compositions were in the range of 14-16 wt.% .<br>
In an atmosphere having a relative humidity of ^5% the base coat compositions of the present invention were sprayed onto primer coated steel test panels in a film thickness of 10-25 ^m (in the dry state). Additionally, two test panels were prepared with a conventional low solids solvent home base coat based on an acrylic/melamine system (comparative example A) and the aqueous core/shell dispersion of Example 5 of EP-A-0 287 144 (comparative example B).<br>
After drying to mat at ambient temperature, the panels were tack free. Next, these test panels were partially covered up and the remaining part was repainted by spraying with a conventional clear coat, a two-component polyester/polyisocyanate coating composition, with the polyisocyanate being a<br><br>
trimer of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (in a film thickness of 50-60 \im in a dry state).<br>
After curing for one day at ambient temperature, the test panels 14-19 showed a metallic coat of high gloss. After one week at ambient temperature, the solvent- and water-resistance of the test panels 14-19 were excellent, comparable with test panels A and B.<br>
The flop of both the base coat and the base coat provided with clear coat was measured (see Table IV). The flop values of the base coats based on the coating compositions according to the invention are excellent, comparable with test panels A and B. The decrease of flop by the application of the clear coat (strike-in) is practically zero, so that the excellent flop is maintained. However, the flop values of the base coat/ clear coat of test panels A and B are significantly lower showing a considerable strike-in effect.<br>
Examples 20-22 and Comparative Example C Base coat compositions were prepared as follows.<br>
A mixture of<br>
20 g of aluminum paste (65 wt.%, Aquavex Sparkle Silver E5000AR from<br>
Silberiine),<br>
25.6 g of butoxyethanol,<br>
30.2 g of SetalEPC 4673,<br>
23.5 g of Cyme! 328*<br>
97.8 g of water, and<br>
7.2 g of a 30 wt.% solution of N,N-dimethyl ethanol amine in water was added with stirring to a mixture of<br>
f33.3 g of a polymer dispersion (1) according to Examples 7-9<br><br>
90.7 g of water, and<br>
13.3 g of a polymer dispersion (II) according to Example 13.<br>
The base coat compositions were brought to a pH of 7.5-8.0 by addition of N,N-dimethyl ethanol amine and diluted with water to spraying viscosity (efflux time of 28 sec in DIN-cup No. 4). Solid content was 20 wt.%.<br>
The base coat compositions were sprayed onto steel test panels in a film thickness of 12-18 jim (in the dry state). After a flash-off period of 2 minutes at 23 "C and 8 minutes at 80 "C, the test panels were repainted with a conventional clearcoat, in a film thickness of 40-45 i^m in the dry state.<br>
The clearcoat was a so-called one component polyacrylate/aminoplaste coating composition. The aminoplaste is a polymeric melamine type resin. After curing for 24 minutes at 140 "C, a metallic coat of good appearance was obtained.<br>
The test panels were tested for their humidity resistance in comparison with a reference waterbome base coat (Example 5 of EP-A-0 287 144; Comparative Example C). The humidity resistance of the test panels 20 to 22 is excellent in comparison to the humidity resistance of test panel C. Table V gives the results of the test.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
