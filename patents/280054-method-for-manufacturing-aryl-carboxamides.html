				<td>Method for manufacturing aryl carboxamides<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing arylcarboxamides of the<br>
formula (I)<br>
<br>
where the substituents are each defined as follows:<br>
Ar is a mono- to trisubstituted phenyl, pyridyl or pyrazolyl ring, where the substituents<br>
are each independently selected from halogen, C1-C4-alkyl and C1-C4-haloalkyl;<br>
M is thienyl or phenyl, which may bear a halogen substituent;<br>
Q is a direct bond, cyclopropylene, a fused bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane or<br>
bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring;<br>
R1 is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkoxy, mono- to<br>
trisubstituted phenyl, where the substituents are each independently selected from<br>
halogen and trifluoromethylthio, or cyclopropyl;<br>
by reacting an acid chloride of the formula (II)<br>
<br>
with an arylamine (III)<br>
<br>
in a suitable nonaqueous solvent.<br>
JP-A 2001/172276 discloses that alky!- or phenylcarbonyl chlorides can be reacted with<br>
arylamines under reduced pressure. The reactions described are carried out without an<br>
auxiliary base, but in highly dilute solutions. For an industrial scale preparation of the<br>
arylcarboxamides (I), this process is, however, unsuitable owing to the large amounts<br>
of solvent. A more concentrated mode of operation is not possible, since this leads to<br>
lump formation and mixing problems, which greatly reduces the yield of product of<br>
value.<br>
Other processes described in the literature for preparing carboxamides from acid<br>
chloride and arylamine without use of an auxiliary base (cf., for example, Journal of<br>
Combinatorial Chemistry (2003), 5(3), 253-259, Structural Chemistry (2006), 17(2),<br>
241-247 and JP-A 1973/049217) are not usable on the industrial scale, because they<br>
afford the desired products of value only in poor yields.<br>
It was accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a process usable on the<br>
industrial scale for preparing the arylcarboxamides (I).<br>
Accordingly, it has been found that the arylcarboxamides (I) are obtainable in high<br>
yields by, in the absence of an auxiliary base,<br>
a) initially charging the acid chloride (II),<br>
b) establishing a pressure of from 0 to 700 mbar,<br>
c) metering in the arylamine (III) in an approximately stoichiometric amount and<br>
d) isolating the product of value.<br>
The acid chlorides (II) are either commercially available or can be prepared, for<br>
example, according to R. C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Verlage<br>
Wiley-VCH, 2nd Edition 1999, pages 1929 ff.<br>
The arylamines (III) are generally obtainable by hydrogenating the corresponding<br>
nitroaromatics. Further details can be found, for example, in R. C. Larock,<br>
Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Verlage Wiley-VCH, 2nd Edition 1999,<br>

Particular preference is given to those carboxamides (I) in which<br>
Ar is a mono- to trisubstituted pyridyl or pyrazolyl ring, where the substituents are each<br>
independently selected from halogen, C1-C4-alkyl and C1-C4-haloalkyl. Very particular<br>
preference is given to those carboxamides (I) in which Ar is a di- or trisubstituted<br>
pyrazolyl ring, where the substituents are each independently selected from halogen,<br>
C1-C4-alkyl and C1-C4-haloalkyl, especially fluorine, chlorine, methyl, difluoromethyl and<br>
trifluoromethyl.'<br>
According to the invention, the reaction is conducted without an auxiliary base in an<br>
organic solvent which is substantially anhydrous. A low water content is understood to<br>
mean from about 0.5 g to 5 g of water per mole of acid chloride (II) used. Larger<br>
amounts of water should be avoided, since the water would lead to an increased<br>
consumption of feedstocks.<br>
Usable solvents are, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m-, p-<br>
xylene, mesitylene, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene, halogenated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethane and dichloroethylene, ethers such as methyl<br>
tert-butyl ethyl, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane or mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are the aromatic hydrocarbons, especially toluene and<br>
o-, m-, p-xylene.<br>
According to the invention, the acid chloride (II) is initially charged, the desired<br>
pressure is established and the arylamine (III) is metered in. Metered addition is<br>
understood to mean both the addition of (III) in portions and the continuous addition of<br>
(III)<br>
a) to the surface of the solution of (II) or<br>
b) directly into the solution of (II), as an "immersed mode of reaction".<br>
The pressure is generally selected such that the reaction mixture boils.<br>
It is normal to work at a pressure between 0 and 700 mbar and a reaction temperature<br>
of from 20 to 120°C, preferably at from 200 to 600 mbar and from 70 to 100°C,<br>
especially at from 350 to 450 mbar and 80 to 90°C.<br>
Acid chloride (II) and arylamine (III) are used in about equimolar amounts, or one of the<br>
components is used in a slight excess of up to 10 mol%. The molar ratio of (III) to (II) is<br>
thus generally from 0.9 :1 to 1.1 :1, preferably from about 1.0 to 1.1.<br>
The metered addition of (III), preferably dissolved in the organic solvent in which (II)<br>
has also been initially charged, is effected typically over the course of from 0.5 to 20<br>
hours, especially from 2 to 10 hours, more preferably from 3 to 5 hours.<br>
The carboxamide (I) is released from the reaction mixture preferably by direct<br>
crystallization or by treatment of the reaction mixture with a suitable base and<br>
subsequent crystallization, for example at from (-20) to 20°C.<br>
Suitable bases for this purpose are alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium and<br>
potassium hydroxide, alkali metaj carbonates such as sodium and potassium<br>
carbonate, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such as sodium and potassium<br>
hydrogencarbonate, alkali metal phosphates such as sodium and potassium<br>
phosphate, alkali metal hydrogenphosphates such as sodium and potassium hydrogen-<br>
phosphate, alkali metal dihydrogenphosphates such as sodium and potassium<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, and also nitrogen bases such as ammonia.<br>
Particular preference is given to the alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium and<br>
potassium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates such as sodium and potassium<br>
carbonate, and also to the alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such as sodium and<br>
potassium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
The base can be used in solid form or in the form of its commercial aqueous solutions.<br>
Preference is given to using a from 1 to 20% by weight aqueous solution, the amount<br>
preferably being such that the pH of the solution is from 3 to 12, preferably from 7 to<br>
10.<br>
The crystalline product of value can finally be removed by means of customary<br>
methods, for example filtration.<br>
The process products (I) are valuable active ingredients in crop protection.<br>

100.0 g (0.504 mol, 98% pure) of 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonyl<br>
chloride were dissolved at 25°C in 257.2 g of toluene. The solution was evacuated to<br>
400 mbar and heated to 85°C. Subsequently, within 3 hours, 492.8 g (0.499 mol, 23%<br>
strength) of toluenic 3',4',5'-trifluorobiphenyl-2-ylamine solution were metered in, after<br>
which stirring was continued for another 1 hour. After venting and cooling to 25°C with<br>
a ramp of 10°C/h, the mixture was stirred overnight. Subsequently, the mixture was<br>
cooled to 0°C, and the solid constituents were filtered off, washed with cold toluene and<br>
dried at 80°C under reduced pressure. The yield (without further processing of the<br>
mother liquor) was 177.7 g (92%).<br>
Example 1a (comparative test)<br>
Synthesis of N-(3',4',5'-trifluorobiphenyl-2-yl)-3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-<br>
carboxamide (analogous mode of reaction to example 1 from JP-A 2001/172276, p. 10)<br>
19.0 g (0.085 mol, 99.8% pure) of 3',4',5'-trifluorobiphenyl-2-ylamine were dissolved in<br>
400.0 g of toluene. Within 1 min, 17.7 g (0.089 mol, 98.1% pure) of 3-difluoromethyl-1-<br>
methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chloride were added at 25°C. Subsequently, the<br>
reaction mixture was evacuated to 72 mbar and heated to 40°C for 3 hours. After<br>
15 min, a white solid formed, which was later converted to a viscous, gel-like<br>
suspension. After cooling to 0°C, the mixture was filtered through a glass frit (very slow,<br>
blockages) and the filtercake was washed with cold toluene. The residue was dried<br>
under reduced pressure and afforded 15.0 g of a mixture of 3',4',5'-trifluorobiphenyl-2-<br>
ylamine hydrochloride (40% by weight) and N-(3',4',5'-trifluorobiphenyl-2-yl)-3-<br>
difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide (48% by weight). The mother<br>
