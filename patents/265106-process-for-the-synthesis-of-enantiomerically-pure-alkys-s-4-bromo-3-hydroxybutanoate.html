				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ENANTIOMERICALLY PURE ALKYL (S)-4-BROMO-3-HYDROXYBUTANOATE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure Alkyl (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate.<br>
(Formula Removed) Formula 1<br>
wherein R is Alkyl (methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl).<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to one pot conversion of D-Erythronolactone to Alkyl (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Alkyl (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate is an important intermediate for the synthesis HMG-coA reductase inhibitors. Another very valuable, synthetic intermediate, (R) -4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid ester, required  in the synthesis of HMG-coA reductase inhibitors is obtained using Alkyl (.S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate as a starting substrate. It is also needed in the synthesis of L-carnitine and GABOB, molecules of medical significance in lipid biosynthesis, [(a) Karanewsky, D. S.; Biller, S. A.; Gordon, E. M.; 1988, Ger. Offen DE 3817375; (b) Sletzinger, M; Verhoeven, T. R.; Volante, R.P.; McNamara, J. M.; Corley, E. G.; Liu, T.M.H. Tetrahedron Letters. 1985, 26, 2951; (c) Brower, P. L; Butler, D. E.; Deering, C. F.; Ee, T. V.; Millar, A.; Nanninga, T. N.; Roth, B.D. Tetrahedron Betters. 1992, 33, 2279; (d) Hollingsworth, R. I.; Wang, G. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1999,10, 1895]. In the prior-art, the synthesis of Alkyl  (5)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate has been accomplished employing various synthetic strategies. A commonly used strategy for the synthesis of Alkyl    (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate    is    to    employ    the    use    of    (S)-3-Hydroxybutyrolactone as a starting point. (S^-3-Hydroxybutyrolactone is first reacted with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid, followed by quenching in ethyl alcohol affords the Ethyl (5)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate.  (Jacks, T;  Elliot, B;  Donald,  E,  WO 98/04543, PCT/US97/11654. 1997; Hollingsworth, R. I.; Wang, G. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1999, 10,1895).<br>
In another prior art method, Alkyl (5)-4-halo-3-hydroxybutanoate can be obtained by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with CO and an aliphatic alcohol in presence of cobalt carbonyl catalyst (Kobayashi, 1. et al JP56068644 1981). In yet another prior-art method, Alkyl (5)-4-halo-3-hydroxybutanoate was obtained by treatment of y-haloacetoacetic ester with fungus selected from the group consisting of Trichosporon, Rhodotorula, Debaryomyces, Cryptococcus, Torulopsis and Candida (Hasegawa, M. et al JP60251890 1985).<br>
In still another prior art method, Alkyl (S)-4-halo-3-hydroxybutanoate was obtained by stereo specific asymmetric reduction of the p-carbonyl group in y-halo-acetoacetic esters, using microbial reduction procedures. The yeast selected from the group Candida genus, Debaryomyces genus, Endomyces genus, Geotricum genus was the preference (Takahashi, S. et al JP61146191 1986).<br>
In another prior-art method, Alkyl (5)-4-halo-3-hydroxybutanoate needed as a raw material for the synthesis of L-'carnitine was once again obtained by stereospecific asymmetric reduction of the p-carbonyl group in y-halo-acetoacetic esters. However this time the microorganism used belonged to Sporobolomyces genus (Yamada, H.etalJP621952901987).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, a bacterium stain [eg Ccllulomonas sq. AKU 672 strain (PERM P-9026), etc] was used for asymmetric reduction of the p-carbonyl group in y-halo-acetoacetic esters, to obtain y-halo-p-hydroxybutyric ester (Yamada, H. et al JP63123387 1988). In still another prior art method, NADPH-dependent reductase of the reduction type derived from the fungus belonging to the genus Sporobolomyces was used for the reduction of y-halo-acetoacetic esters, for obtaining the y-halo-p-hydroxybutyric ester (Yamada, H. et al JP63304991 1988). In yet another prior art method, an enzyme extracted from baker's yeast has been used for reduction of the p-carbonyl group in y-halo-acetoacetic esters, for the obtension of y-halo-p (^)-hydroxybutyric ester (Hasegawa. M, et al JP1060391 1989) In another prior-art method, specific microorganism belonging to the genus Stemphylium has been used for reduction of the [3-carbonyl group in y-halo-acetoacetic esters, for the obtension of y-halo-p (S^-hydroxy butyric ester (Onishi. I, et alJP6038776 1994).<br>
In another prior art method, microbial reduction has been used for the production of optically active 4-halo-3-hydroxybutyric acid esters (Kobayashi. Y, et al EP0606899 1994). In yet another prior art method, specific microorganism belonging to the genera Yarrowia, Filobasidium, Metschnikowia, Galactomyces, Ambrosiozyma,<br>
Trichosporonoides etc, has been used for reduction of the (3-carbonyl group in y-halo-acetoacetic esters, for the obtension of y-halo-p-hydroxybutyric ester (Takai. Y, et al EP0737751 1996). In still another prior art method, the (S)-4-halo-3-hydroxybutyric acid ester was prepared by reduction of 4-halo-acetic acid ester using (3-ketoacyl-acylcarrier protein reductase for stereospecificity (Yamamoto, H. EP 0955375, 1999). In yet another prior-art method, the optically active 4-chloro-3-hydroxy butanoic acid ester has   been   obtained   by   the   acid   hydrolysis   of  optically   active   4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyronitrile. (Sakaguchi, J JP 4124157, 1992). In still another prior-art method, 4-halo-3-hydroxybutyronitrile has been hydrolysed using nitrile hydrolase derived from a bacterium belonging to the genus Arthobacter, Nocardia, Pseudonocardia, Rhodococcus or Caseobacter to produce 4-halo-3-hydroxybutyric acid (Fujio, T. JP 4360689, 1992). In another prior-art method, the optically active 4-chloro-3-hydroxy butanoic acid ester has been obtained by the hydrolysis of optically active 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyronitrile using enzyme nitriiase from a bacterium belonging to the genus Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Cornybacterium, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Cytophaga, Alcaligenes, etc. (Nakayama, K. JP 61173789, 1986). In still another prior art method, optically active 3,4-dihydroxy butyric acid derivative or 3-hydroxybutyrolactone is reacted with a brominating agent preferably hydrogen bromide to afford the title compound (Taoka, N. M. JP 4149151, 1992). In yet another prior art method, potassium salt of D-erythronate obtained from D-arabinose was treated with brominating agent (HBr) and subsequent hydrogenation using Pd/C afforded the title compound (Bock, K. Acta. Chemica. Scandinavica. B 37, 1983,341-344).<br>
Some of the major drawbacks of the methods known in the prior art are such as<br>
(i)        Specificity of the micro-organism<br>
(ii)      Lack of specificity in the reduction<br>
(iii)     Difficulties involved in work-up procedure<br>
(iv)     Difficulties associated in handling microbial cultures and cells<br>
(v)       Overall low yield of the desired compound<br>
(vi)      Low enantioselectivity and contamination of the undesired isomer.<br>
In view of the above drawbacks and disadvantages of prior art procedures, it is<br>
desirable to develop an improved, efficient and enantioselective process for the<br>
synthesis of Alkyl (,S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>

The contents were stirred at room temperature (35°C to 38°C) for 18 h and TLC analysis indicated consumption of starting material. The contents of the flask were distilled to remove the acetic acid at laboratory vacuum and at a temperature of 45°C to 50°C to provide dark orange coloured oil of 2,4-dibromo-3-hydroxy butyric acid.To the same flask containing the above 2,4-dibromo-3-hydroxybutyric acid, is added 40 mL of methanol and stirring continued at room temperature (35°C to 38°C) for 16 h and TLC indicated consumption of starting material and formation of Methyl-2, 4-dibromo-3-hydroxy butanoate. Excess of methanol is distilled and the residual orange liquid is purified using silica-gel chromatography with Hexane: EtOAc (4 :1) as eluent, to afford 13.1 (70%) of Methyl 2,4-dibromo-3-hydroxybutanoate<br>

powder and stirring continued at room temperature (35°C to 38°C) for a period of 6 h and TLC indicated consumption of Methyl-2, 4-dibromo-3-hydroxy butanoate. The content of the flask is filtered through a pad of Celite to remove the suspended zinc and zinc salts, and the solid residue in the funnel washed with additional methanol. The filtrate along with the washings is distilled to remove methanol under vacuum at 35°C and the product obtained, Methyl (5)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoate is purified using silica gel chromatography using Hexane: EtOAc (4 :1) as eluent or distilled at 78°C-80°C (1 mm of Hg) to afford 4.6 g (49.6 %).
