DESCRIPTION<br>
FILTERING DEVICE INCORPORATING NANOPARTICLES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a filtering device for removing biological contaminants such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and toxins from nonaqueous fluids.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A number of patents exist with devices employing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic filters. United States patent no. 6,375,854 and copending patent application serial no. 10/128,367, filed on April 22, 2002, are notable examples.<br>
Furthermore, United States patent application 20020035032, published on March 21, 2002, discloses metal oxide and metal hydroxide nanocrystals (also termed "nanoparticles") which can be used in the form of powder or pellets for destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, and toxins. According to that patent application, preferred metal oxides and hydroxides include MgO, Ce02, AgO, SrO, BaO, CaO, Ti02, Zr02, FeO, V203, V205, Mn203, Fe203, NiO, CuO, A1203, Si02, ZnO, Ag20, Mg(0H)2, Ca(OH)2, Al(OH)3, Sr(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, Fe(OH)3, Cu(OH)3, Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, Zn(OH)2, Ag(OH), and mixtures thereof.<br>
That application indicates the nanoparticles can be used alone or can have at least a portion of their surfaces coated with either (a) a second metal oxide different from the first metal oxide and selected from oxides of metals selected from the group consisting of Ti, V, Fe, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Al, Ce, Sr, Ba, and mixtures thereof or (b) metal nitrates such as those selected from the group consisting of Cu(N03)2, Ce(N03)3, AgN03, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, Ti02 is coated with a mixture of cerium nitrate and copper nitrate to form [Ce(N03)3â€”Cu(N03)2]Ti02.<br>
Another embodiment of that application has reactive atoms stabilized on the surfaces of particulate metal oxides; such reactive atoms are different from the atoms forming the metal oxide. Again the oxides are selected from the group consisting of MgO, Ce02, AgO, SrO, BaO, CaO, Ti02, Zr02, FeO, V203, V205, Mn203, Fe203, NiO, CuO, A1203, Si02, ZnO, Ag20, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the reactive atoms are selected from the group consisting of halogens and Group I metals. When halogens are the reactive atoms being stabilized on the surfaces of the particles, the atoms can be<br><br>
* atoms of the same halogen, e.g., only chlorine atoms, or mixtures of atoms of different halogens, e.g., chlorine and bromine atoms.<br>
And a final embodiment of that application has particulate metal oxides having species different from the metal oxide adsorbed on the surfaces of the metal oxide. Once more the oxides are selected from the group consisting of MgO, Ce02, AgO, SrO, BaO, CaO, Ti02, Zr02, FeO, V203, V205, Mn203s Fe203, NiO, CuO, A1203, Si02, ZnO, Ag20, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the adsorbed species are selected from the group consisting of oxides of Group V elements, oxides of Group VI elements, and ozone. Preferred oxides of Group V and VI elements are N02 and S02, respectively.<br>
United States patent application 20020070172, published on June 13, 2002, discloses the use of particle, pellets, and granules of fine-particle or nanoparticle iron oxides and/or iron oxyhydroxides to remove pollutants in a unit through which a fluid flows. In water purification the material is used in horizontal- or vertical-flow filters or adsorber columns or added to the water. In gas purification it is used in adsorbers for binding undesirable components such as hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, and hydrogen cyanaide as well as other phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, sufur, selenium, tellurium, cyano, and heavy metal compounds in waste gases. Gases such as HF, HC1, H2s, SOXs and NOx can also be adsorbed.<br>
Finally, in June, 2002, the Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology of the Committee on Technology for the National Science and Technology Council published the National Nanotechnology Initiative: the Initiative and Its Implementation Plan as a detailed technical report associated with the Supplemental Report to the President's FY 2003 Budget. This report, on pages 66 and 67, states:<br>
"Gas mask filters used in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) applications remove toxic chemicals by a process that remains essentially a WWII technology. The material responsible for chemical vapor/gas removal is an activated carbon impregnated using a Whetlerite method that impregnates metal oxides, such as, copper, zinc, molybdenum, and silver, into the larger pores of the carbon. In a very real sense activated carbon is replete with nanopores ranging from about 0.5 nm to 500 nm. Nanoscience can provide new opportunities for high surface area adsorbents and can further provide new molecular templating techniques that can augment the bonding strength.  Optimized in another way, nanoporous materials can assist in the separation<br><br>
'technologies necessary to geometrically block the migration of agents through use of a membrane.<br>
"Collective protection systems and and protective clothing frequently utilize fibrous filters to remove agents. High-efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filters can be effective against particulates; even the biological toxins that might be dispersed as aerosols could be filtered out by HEPA. The use of nanotubes, nanofilaments, and nanoporous membranes might make these filters even more effective, and might include catalytic degraders as well."<br>
None of the preceding, however, suggests using nanoparticles that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins in conjunction with hydrophobic or hydrophilic filters. Nor, although the article seems to suggest using nanoparticles, themselves, to create a filter and may indicate impregnating carbon with nanoparticles, do the preceding seem to suggest coating any type of filter with nanoparticles, placing nanoparticle pellets adjacent to any type of filter, or impregnating any filter material other than carbon with nanoparticles.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in a first embodiment, combines any type of nanoparticle that is known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fimgi, viruses, or toxins with one or more hydrophobic or hydrophilic filters.<br>
The nanoparticles can be in the form of either a powder or a pellet.<br>
When a powder is employed, the hydrophobic or hydrophilic filter is, using any technique that is known in the art, either coated or impregnated with the powder.<br>
Preferably, in the case of coating, the hydrophobic or hydrophilic filter carries an electrostatic charge of a given polarity; and the nanoparticles are, using any technique that is well known in the art, given a charge of opposite polarity, either in the creation of the nanoparticle or through electrical induction.<br>
In an article copyrighted by the American Chemical Society (Langmuir 2002, 18, 6679-6686) and entitled "Metal Oxide Nanoparticles as Bactericidal Agents" Peter K. Stoimenov, Rosalyn L. Klinger, George L. Marchin, and Kenneth J. Klabunde, for example, explain ". . . all AP-MgO/X2 formulations are positively charged (27.0 mV (AP-MgO/Br2), 33.0 mV (AP-MgO/Cl2), and 35.2 mV (AP-MgO) at 0.01 ionic strength NaCl)." (According to that article, "AP" indicates that the nanoparticle has been prepared through an aerogel procedure.)<br><br>
When pellets are utilized, such pellets are placed adjacent to a hydrophobic or hydrophilic filter and, together with the filter, are contained within an encasement having an inlet and an outlet.<br>
Preferably one or. more hydrophobic filters are utilized in serial fluid communication with one or more hydrophilic filters. The nanoparticle coating or the pellets of nanoparticles can be placed on either the upstream or the downstream side of any one or more hydrophobic or hydrophilic filters. The filters are contained within an encasement having an inlet and an outlet, whether one or more filters is coated or has pellets adjacent to such filter or filters.<br>
If the pellets are placed on a side of a filter which has no other filter facing it, some means for containing the pellets is necessary. In the case of the powder used to coat the filter (rather than being impregnated into the filter), a containment means is merely preferable.<br>
For the pellets, it is preferable to have the inlet or the outlet (depending upon which is closer to the nanoparticles) of the encasement consist of one or more apertures having a maximum dimension that is less than the minimum dimension of the pellets.<br>
For the powder coating, a membrane having a pore size smaller than the powder particles but large enough not to impede the flow of a gas substantially, preferably a pore size at least as large as the pore size of the hydrophobic or hydrophilic filter having the smallest pore size, is preferably placed across the inlet or outlet (depending upon which is closer to the nanoparticles).<br>
Such a membrane may similarly be used when the hydrophobic or hydrophilic filter is impregnated with nanoparticles, although this is not generally done.<br>
In further embodiments, the present invention utilizes, in place of the hydrophobic or hydrophilic filter, a filter of any type of known filter material except, in the case of impregnation with nanoparticles, carbon.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
As discussed above, a number of type of nanoparticles (1) are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins. The present invention combines any type of such nanoparticles (1) with one or more filters (2).<br>
In a first principal embodiment, shown in FIG. 1, any type of nanoparticle pellets (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins are adjacent to a filter (2) within an encasement (3) having an inlet (4) and an outlet (5). Of course, if the nanoparticle pellets (1) are between the inlet (4) and the filter (2), some means must exist to contain the nanoparticle pellets (1). Any such means known in the art may be employed. Preferably, however, the one or more apertures (6) which comprise the inlet (4) each have a maximum cross-sectional dimension (7) that is less than the minimum dimension (8) of the nanoparticle pellets (1). Similarly, when the nanoparticle pellets (1) are between the outlet (5) and the filter (2), there must be a containment means, which preferably comprises having the one or more apertures (9) which comprise the outlet (5) each have a maximum dimension (10) that is less than the minimum dimension (8) of the nanoparticle pellets (1). Preferably, the nanoparticle pellets (1) are between the inlet (4) and the filter (2).<br>
Preferably, the filter (2) has an electrical charge that is the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle, wherein the term "target particle," as used herein,<br><br>
means the basic unit of any entity which the filter (2) is intended to exclude, such as a bacterium.<br>
Optionally, the filter (2) is hydrophobic. In another optional embodiment, the filter (2) is hydrophilic.<br>
A second principal embodiment, portrayed in FIG. 2, comprises a filter (2) coated on at least a first side (11) with a powder (12) of any type of nanoparticles (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins.<br>
Preferably, coating is accomplished by having the filter (2) carry an electrical charge that is opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1) in the powder (12). Also preferably, the filter (2) has an electrical charge that is the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle.<br>
Most preferably, an electrical charge on the filter (2) is both opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1) in the powder (12) and the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle. For example, the nanoparticle (1) can be AP-MgO/Br2, AP-MgO/Ch, or AP-MgO, all of which are, as indicated above, positively charged. The filter (2) is then selected to have a negative electrical charge, which attracts the positively charged nanoparticles (1). Since, according to pages 6681 through 6682 in the Langmuir article quoted above, ". . . it is a well-established fact in the literature [citing Busscher, H. J.; Bos, R.; van der Mei, H. C; Handley, P. S. in Physical Chemistry of Biological Interfaces', Baszkin, A., Norde, W., Eds.; Marcel Dekker: New York, 2000.] that the overall charge of the bacteria and spore cells at biological pH values is negative, because of the excess number of carboxylic and other groups which upon dissociation make the cell surface negative." Thus, in this most preferred situation, the electrical charge of the filter (2) tends to repel the bacteria while any bacteria that do reach the coating nanoparticle powder (12) tend to be attracted to and destroyed by the positively charged nanoparticles (1).<br>
Again, optionally, the filter (2) can be hydrophobic; and, optionally, it can be hydrophilic. An example of a commercially available hydrophobic filter is that sold under the trademarked name FILTRETE by the 3M company of St. Paul, Minnesota. And an example of a commercially available hydrophilic filter is that sold under the name Heat and Moisture Exchange Media also by the 3M company of St. Paul, Minnesota.<br><br>
Also optionally, the filter (2) is contained within an encasement (3) having an inlet (4) and an outlet (5). Preferably, the first side (11) of the filter (2) is directed toward the inlet (4) and a second side (13) of the filter (2) is directed toward the outlet (5). And preferably, if a coated side (11), (13) of the filter (2) is directed toward the inlet (4), such inlet (4) is covered by a membrane (14) having a pore size smaller than the nanoparticles (1) but large enough not to impede the flow of a gas substantially, preferably a pore size at least as large as the pore size of the filter (2). Similarly, preferably, if a coated side (11), (13) of the filter (2) is directed toward the outlet (5), such outlet (5) is covered by a membrane (14) having a pore size smaller than the nanoparticles (1) but large enough not to impede the flow of a gas substantially, preferably a pore size at least as large as the pore size of the filter (2).<br>
Suitable membranes (14) are termed "webbing" and are, for example, commercially available from either the 3M company of St. Paul, Minnesota, or the Versal company of Los Angeles, California.<br>
This principal embodiment was used to test the effectiveness of the nanoparticles (1) in destroying a bacterium when placed upon a hydrophobic filter (2).<br>
Example<br>
A portion of a top surface of each of six horizontally oriented negatively charged hydrophobic FILTRETE filters was coated with positively charged AP-MgO/Ch- Also on top of the filters but not necessarily just in the location of the nanoparticles were placed an average of 226,000 colony-forming units of bacterium thuringiensis. There was no flow of air through the filter.<br>
As a control, on a portion of a top surface of each of six uncoated horizontally oriented negatively charged hydrophobic FILTRETE filters were placed an average of 226,000 colony-forming units of bacterium thuringiensis.<br>
After twenty-four hours, the number of colony forming units on the uncoated filters had increased by an average of more than 6507 percent while the number of colony forming units on the coated filters had decreased by an average of 21.7 percent.<br>
For the third principal embodiment, depicted in FIG. 3, a filter (2) is, using any technique that is known in the art, impregnated with any type of nanoparticles (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins.<br><br>
Preferably, the filter (2) carries an electrical charge that is opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1). Also preferably, the filter (2) has an electrical charge that is the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle.<br>
Most preferably, an electrical charge on the filter (2) is both opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1) and the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle.<br>
Once again, optionally, the filter (2) can be hydrophobic; and, optionally, it can be hydrophilic.<br>
Also optionally, the filter (2) is contained within an encasement (3) having an inlet (4) and an outlet (5).<br>
The final four principal embodiments all employ an encasement (3) having an inlet (4) and an outlet (5) and containing two or more filters (2) in serial fluid communication with each other. Optionally, at least one of the filters (2) is hydrophobic; and, also optionally, at least one of the filters (2) is hydrophilic. Furthermore, preferably at least one of the filters (2) has an electrical charge that is the same as an electrical charge of at least one target particle; and, preferably, the filter (2) nearest the inlet (4) is hydrophobic.<br>
The fourth principal embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 4, has adjacent to and between at least two consecutive filters (2) any type of nanoparticle pellets (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins.<br>
In the fifth principal embodiment, seen in FIG. 5, any type of nanoparticle pellets (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins are at least adjacent to a filter (2) that has no other filter (2) between such filter (2) and an external passageway (4), (5). As used herein, the term "external passageway" shall include both an inlet (4) and an outlet (5) and, when used in the singular, shall designate either an inlet (4) or an outlet (5). The nanoparticle pellets are between such filter (2) and the external passageway (4), (5) which is nearer to the filter (2). Preferably, such external passageway (4), (5) is the inlet (4) of the encasement (3).<br>
Of course, as with the first principal embodiment, in the fifth principal embodiment some means must exist to contain the nanoparticle pellets (1). Any such means known in the art may be employed. Preferably, however, when the nanoparticle pellets (1) are between the filter (2) and the inlet (4), the one or more apertures (6) which comprise the inlet (4) each have a maximum dimension (7) that is less than the<br><br>
minimum dimension (8) of the nanoparticle pellets (1). Similarly, when the nanoparticle pellets (1) are between the outlet (5) and the filter (2), the containment means preferably comprises having the one or more apertures (9) which comprise the outlet (5) each have a maximum dimension (10) that is less than the minimum dimension (8) of the nanoparticle pellets (1).<br>
For the sixth principal embodiment, pictured in FIG. 6, a first side (11) of at least one filter (2) is coated with a powder (12) of any type of nanoparticles (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins.<br>
Preferably, coating is accomplished by having the filter (2) carry an electrical charge that is opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1) in the powder (12). Most preferably, an electrical charge on the filter (2) is both opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1) and the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle.<br>
Also preferably, at least one such coated filter (2) has no other filter (2) between such filter (2) and the inlet (4) of the encasement (3); and most preferably the first side (11) of such filter (2) is directed toward the inlet (4).<br>
When a coated side (11), (13) of a filter (2) is directed toward an external passageway (4), (5) and no other filter (2) is between such coated filter (2) and the external passageway (4), (5), such external passageway is preferably covered by a membrane (14) having a pore size smaller than the nanoparticles (1) but large enough not to impede the flow of a gas substantially, preferably a pore size at least as large as the pore size of the filter (2) which has the smallest pore size.<br>
In the seventh embodiment, portrayed in FIG. 7, at least one filter (2), which is, preferably, the filter (2) closest to the inlet (4) of the encasement (3), is, using any technique that is known in the art, impregnated with any type of nanoparticles (1) that are known to be capable of destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, or toxins.<br>
Preferably, the impregnated filter (2) carries an electrical charge that is opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1). Most preferably, an electrical charge on the impregnated filter (2) is both opposite to an electrical charge carried by the nanoparticles (1) and the same as the electrical charge of at least one target particle.<br>
As used herein the term "preferable" or "preferably" means that a specified element or technique is more acceptable than another but not that such specified element or technique is a necessity.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The way in which the Filtering Device Incorporating Nanoparticles is capable of exploitation in industry and the way in which the Filtering Device Incorporating Nanoparticles can be made and used are obvious from the description and the nature of the Filtering Device Incorporating Nanoparticles.<br><br><br>
