STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved electronic locking system comprising of a key processor for verifying correctness of the command by matching the password fed by the user in the processor with the code of a key characterized in that a key unit such as herein described for receiving input commands from the user by means of a key, wherein the key processor forwards the correct command to a locking device provided with a sensor and display and incorrect command to an alarm unit for being triggered in which the alarm unit is lenient alarm unit, moderate alarm unit and door break in alarm system; password circuitry, a part of which is provided in the key and other part is provided inside the locking system and the key comprising of normal key, owner recognition key, power back up key, time over drive key and master overdrive key.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further object and advantage of this invention will be more apparent from   the   ensuing   description   when   read   in   conjunction   with   the accompanying drawings and wherein: Fig. 1: shows the block diagram of the system.<br>
Fig   2: shows the flow chart indicating the working of he system.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPAYING DRAWINGS<br>
Reference may be made to fig. 1, which shows the block diagram of the door locking system comprising a Black box (1), locking device (2), Key unit (3, 4), main unit (5-14) and main alert unit (8)<br><br>
The black box which may optionally be provided comprises a recorder unit for recording all the actions taken place with a provision for entry info log, which records key code and the duration for which the user is logged in on paper in seismograph pattern. The locking device (2) is provided with means for locking and unlocking which enables the user to set time for opening and closing the door.<br>
In the open status, normal key is used in a panel (3) to open the lock and in the closed status normal key and time over drive key are used simultaneously. This enables to temporarily skip timed status without disturbing any other setting. In the instance, normal key is incorrect Local Siren (9) and Lenient alarm unit (6).get triggered. The alert unit produces audible sound along with visual display to alert the people in the premises about the error in key or act of the miscreant in the premises where it is installed. As a result, the alarm inside the protected room starts working. This unit has an adjustable timer, which can be adjusted suiting the needs of the owner. The purpose of providing the timer is to correct the mistakes made by the owner is executing the key (i.e. the normal and/or the power backup key). If the timer is not to be used the timer may simply.be turned off. The password is processed in the key processor unit (5). if the password for the key, and/or power backup is found incorrect, A.l. unit is triggered. If due to any one of the two reasons the Al is triggered, it activates the timer for adjusted period of time, in which the owner has to correct its mistake and enter the premises to deactivate Al from taking any further actions and has to reset it, However, on the expiration of the set time, alarm unit transmits the signal and Master alarm unit (7), breaker (10) and transmitter (8) get triggered. If the timer is not to be adjusted, directly A3, Transmitter, and<br><br><br><br>
Breaker units are triggered automatically. This causes the transmitter to transmit the signal to a wirelessly connected main alert unit (8') kept in a neighboring centre such a police station or reliable neighbors residence. As a result, the neighbor is put on alert with audible sound and visual display. This unit also unlocks over drive key.<br>
Under this situation, the system is disarmed with the help of normal key and time-overdrive key provided with the owner and over drive key provided with the neighboring area. This feature ensures presence of owner while unlocking the lock and as a result, the key can't be misused. In case the over drive key is faulty, besides local and main sirens, other parts of the locking system cease functioning. This over drive key is functionless; until the breaker circuit is activated and the key is locked until the moment the main siren box is triggered so as to prevent copying of the key. Each transmitter-alert system is set at different radio frequencies from other sets to prevent false activation of alarm.<br>
In case the time over drive key is incorrect, Local siren and moderate alarm unit (4) get triggered to alert the user. This unit also has an adjustable timer, which can be adjusted suiting the needs of the owner. The purpose of providing the timer is to correct the mistakes by the owner in executing the key (i.e. time overdrive key). If the timer is not to be used the timer may simply be turned off. The only difference between moderate alarm unit and Lenient alarm unit is that it has a timer to be adjusted for shorter time duration. If the password for the time overdrive key is found incorrect, moderate alaim unit is triggered. If the moderate alarm unit is triggered it activates the timer for adjusted period of time, in which the owner has to correct its mistake and enter the premises to<br><br><br><br>
deactivate moderate alarm unit from taking any further actions and has to reset it, otherwise main alarm unit, Transmitter, and Breaker units are triggered automatically after expiry of the adjusted time period. If the timer is not to be adjusted, directly main alarm unit, Transmitter, and Breaker units are triggered automatically.<br>
The main alarm unit (7) is most important among all the units in alarm system. It works as a relay linking for Transmitter, and Breaker units which links the same to certain other units. When it gets triggered there is no stopping or turning back, it simply informs transmitter and breaker units simultaneously which take further actions.<br>
The breaker unit (10) plays a major role in the protection of the secure area.<br>
This unit is activated when master alarm and the transmitter unit are triggered. When activated all the locking and unlocking controls are shifted to this unit, and normal key alone doesn't solve the purpose of arming and disarming. This requires an overdrive key, which is used together with the normal and time overdrive keys to disarm the system. The purpose of this system is to make sure that the secure area is completely safe from any further tries of entry. This also prevents thefts by the neighbors etc. This circuit does not affect in any way function of other parts of the system.    .<br>
The locking device is provided with a sensor, which enables the device to transfer the signal to the master alarm through a door break in alarm<br><br>
system (12) so as to activate transrriter and breaker followed by main alert unit. For disarming the sance procedure is followed as in other cases of disarming when trainsmiter and main alert unit are activated. The locking system of the present invention can be installed on any suitable place .apart from the door. The panel. (3) provided adjacent to the locking device is disposed with a keyguard therein.<br>
The key guard is an additional safety feature, built particularly for preventing tampering of the device and also for preventing the user from taking the key out during the disarmed mode or the usage of the locking device. This provision firstly avoid;; theft and hence the chances of duplication of the key. Secondly, it eliminates possibility of manipulation in the recording of the black box. However, forceful stealing of the key automatically activates local siren, master alarm, transmitter and breaker altogether so as to check the theft.<br>
The panel can also referred to as a key unit, is an input-unit, which receives commands from the user, but on manipulation, it does not affect the security arrangement inside the protected area. The key unit having a visual-display (4) which informs the user by means of the visual display about the different happenings such as logg-in, theft, triggering of alarm etc.<br>
The key unit also comprises a switch, which in the OPEN STATUS opens or shuts the door, also in the open mode activates the key guard to lock<br>
the kev.<br><br><br>
All the keys are designed in such a way that, a duplicate key can't be obtained without knowing the anatomy of both the lock and key. To ensure extended safety a part of the password circuitry is provided in the key and other part is provided inside the locking device (2). The device of the present invention is also having provision for changing of password(s) easily by the user.<br>
In the instance, over drive key is incorrect, the power distribution system ceases to function leaving full system dead except local and main siren. This feature provides additional safety in addition to other provisions against key duplication, dismantling of the system etc.<br>
The normal key is provided with unique identification code facility, which a key processor (5) recognizes as a unique identity by matching the password feci by the user. The device is equipped with an automatic power backup system, which is provided for all the units including alarm system except the locking mechanism. For the locking mechanism, the normal key is having inbuilt power backup password which activates power backup for this unit. To avoid failure of the alarm system and other security systems due to power failure, power backup system is provided with a battery pack to supply power.<br>
This system is provided with various types of keys as follows: -<br>
The normal key is for the daily/normal usage, and equal number of keys are made as many users are there.<br>
The owner recognition key is for the purpose of recognition of code in each key for each user, so that easy logging of in-out data is possible through the recorder unit. This key is in built in the normal key.<br><br><br>
The power backup key is also inbuilt in the normal key. This serves as the power backup activation system verifier for the locking mechanism. Remaining parts have automatic power backups.<br>
The time overdrive key is used for the purpose of skipping temporarily the closed status to disarm the security system.<br>
Master overdrive key, is unlocked only when the full controls are shifted from the owners to the police/neighbors.<br>
The system is provided with connector(s) loose display, which comes amongst the additional safety features, built particularly for the prevention of tampering of device. This feature enables the user to know if any of the connector/s between two of the components or units is/are loose or disconnected. Which may only be possible due to installer's fault or if someone or something tries to tamper with the lock. If the connector(s) come(s) loose due to any reasons stated, A3, local siren, transmitter and breaker altogether get triggered automatically.<br>
Reference may be made to the flow chart for clear understanding of the working of the system.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims: -<br><br><br>
