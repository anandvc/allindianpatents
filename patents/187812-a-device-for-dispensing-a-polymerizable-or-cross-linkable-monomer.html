This invention relates to monomer and polymer compositions useful to form biomedical adhesives and sealants, and methods of applying them. More particularly, this invention relates to methods of applying monomer and polymer compositions and their use for medical, surgical and other in vivo applications. 2.     Description of Related Art<br>
Products in primary use for wound closure are surgical sutures and staples.  Sutures are recognized to provide adequate wound support.   However, sutures cause additional trauma to the wound site (by reason of the need for the needle and suture to pass through tissue and the need to anesthetize the wound area via needle application) and are time-consuming to place, and, at skin level, can cause unattractive wound closure marks. Surgical staples have been developed to speed wound apposition and provide improved cosmetic results.  However, surgical staples also impose additional wound trauma and require the use of ancillary and often expensive devices for positioning and applying the staples.   Both sutures and staples are especially problematic  in pediatric  cases  where  the patient may have a strong fear response and refuse tc cooperate with their placement, and in geriatric pases where the skin tissue is weaker and prone to tearing.<br>
Alternatively, adhesives have been proposed as wound closure devices. One group of such adhesives is the monomeric forms of alpha-cyanoacrylates.<br>
Reference is made, for example, to U.S. Patents Nos. 5,328,687 to Leung et al; 3,527,841 to Wicker et al.; 3,722,599 to Robertson et al.; 3,995,641 to Kronenthal et al.; and 3,940,362 to Overhults, which disclose alpha-cyanoacrylates that are useful as surgical adhesives. All<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process  for application of a surgical adhesive composition in a bridge structure that provides  an unexpectedly improved bond strength over conventional application techniques of the polymerized composition on the wound or incision site, which increases the effectiveness of monomers and polymers in in vivo applications.  The surgical adhesive forms a flexible and strong bond over wounds and incisions. Moreover, the method of applying a surgical adhesive to a wound  or  incision  provides  a  strong  and  flexible biocompatible bond.    The present  invention  is  also directed to methods of applying a monomeric composition with a porous applicator tip and with an applicator tip having a non-uniform distribution of initiator or rate modifier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS One embodiment of the present invention provides a wound closure monomer composition, comprising:<br>
A)	at least one monomer, which forms a medically acceptable wound closure polymer:<br>
B)	at least one plasticizing agent; and<br>
C)	at least one acidic stabilizing agent.<br>
In other embodiments, the present invention is directed to methods of using the above-described monomers, copolymers and polymers made therefrom for biomedical purposes.. See U.S. Patent Serial No. 0B/6Q9,921, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
In one such embodiment, the edges of a wound or incision are held together and an excessive amount of the above-described surgical adhesive composition is applied to the already pinched or abutted opposing wound edges, preferably utilizing more than one application stroke. This process forms a bridge over the abutted opposing wound edges that is flexible and possesses high tensile strength.  The excessive amount of adhesive placed on the<br><br>
