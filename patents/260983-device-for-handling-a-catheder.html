Device for handling a catheter<br>
The invention relates to a device for handling a catheter<br>
with an elongate valve body, a lever arm which is<br>
prestressed by means of a spring element and mounted<br>
pivotably on the valve body so as to be pivotable from a<br>
first end position into a second end position counter to<br>
the prestressing force of the spring element, a pressure<br>
piston which is received in the valve body and can be<br>
moved in the longitudinal direction by means of the lever<br>
arm in order to open a sealing element in the valve body<br>
when the lever arm is moved in the direction of the<br>
second end position, and a catch mechanism which has an<br><br>
arresting arrangement and a catch tongue interacting<br>
therewith in order to hold the lever arm in at least one<br>
catching position.<br>
Such a device is known from DE 195 26 075 C1, for<br>
example. In this device, for actuating a pressure piston<br>
introduced in a valve body by means of a lever arm, a<br>
flexible arresting piece with a catch nose is designed in<br>
one piece on a valve body, with which piece a catching<br>
end of the lever arm can be held in a catching position.<br>
The arresting piece extends essentially at right angles<br>
to the valve body. In the catching position, a clamping<br>
force is exerted on a catheter guided through the valve<br>
body and the pressure piston in order to secure the<br>
catheter against unintentional displacement in the axial<br>
direction.<br>
A further such device is known from WO 01/15768 A1, for<br>
example. In this device, the arresting piece has a number<br>
of catch noses for locking the lever arm in a number of<br>
catching positions and an actuating wing which is aligned<br>
in prolongation of the lever arm in the catching<br>
positions of the lever arm.<br>
Although the abovementioned device can be operated very<br>
easily and ergonomically, a desire exists on the part of<br>
the user for the usability to be improved further.<br>
Against this background, the object of the present<br>
invention is to develop the device referred to in the<br>
introduction in such a way that easier operation is made<br>
possible.<br>
This object is achieved in the abovementioned device by<br>
virtue of the fact that the catch mechanism is designed<br><br>
in such a way that the arresting arrangement and the<br>
catch tongue come out of engagement when the second end<br>
position of the lever arm is reached, so that the spring<br>
element guides the lever arm back into the first end<br>
position.<br>
In other words, the catch mechanism is designed in such a<br>
way that the user simply has to press the lever arm into<br>
the second end position in order to arrive at the first<br>
end position again. When the lever arm reaches the second<br>
end position, the catch tongue is released from the<br>
arresting arrangement and as it were frees the catch<br>
mechanism, so that the lever arm can then move into the<br>
first end position. In this connection, the spring<br>
element ensures the return of the lever arm into the<br>
first end position.<br>
The reason operation is so simple for the user is that in<br>
the end he has to perform only one movement of the lever<br>
arm, namely pressing the lever arm in the direction of<br>
the second end position. It is consequently no longer<br>
necessary to release the catching position of the lever<br>
arm by, for example, pressing an actuating wing as is<br>
proposed in the publication WO 01/15768 A1 referred to<br>
above.<br>
In a preferred development of the invention, the<br>
arresting arrangement has a number of catch noses which<br>
are arranged along a concentric line around the fulcrum<br>
of the lever arm in order to define a number of catching<br>
positions of the lever arm between the two end positions.<br>
These measures have the advantage that the several<br>
catching positions further simplify usability as the user<br><br>
can better adjust the clamping force acting on the<br>
catheter.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the catch nose facing<br>
the valve body follows a guide surface extending at an<br>
angle in order, when the second end position of the lever<br>
arm is reached, to guide the catch tongue onto that side<br>
of the arresting arrangement facing away from the catch<br>
nose, so that the catch tongue cannot enter into<br>
engagement with the catch noses when the lever arm is<br>
returned into the first end position.<br>
In other words, a surface which extends upward at an<br>
angle (away from the valve body) toward the rear surface<br>
in relation to the catch noses is provided at that end of<br>
the arresting arrangement facing the valve body. The<br>
catch tongue on the lever arm is thus guided onto the<br>
rear side of the catch noses when the second end position<br>
is reached, so that the catch tongue cannot come into<br>
contact with the catch noses during the travel of the<br>
lever arm into the first end position.<br>
This measure results in a very simple design of the<br>
arresting arrangement and makes very safe operation<br>
possible.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the catch tongue and<br>
the catch noses extend transversely to the longitudinal<br>
direction of the valve body.<br>
This measure is especially simple as far as construction<br>
is concerned.<br><br>
In a preferred development, the lever arm has an<br>
elongated hole, through which a lateral tube starting<br>
from the valve body extends.<br>
This measure makes a very compact device with great<br>
stability possible, in particular also with regard to the<br>
lever arm, which can be stabilized additionally by the<br>
interaction of elongated hole and lateral tube.<br>
The valve body and/or the lever arm are preferably<br>
designed as injection-molded parts, the valve body and<br>
the arresting arrangement preferably being provided as<br>
one-piece components.<br>
Further advantages and developments of the invention<br>
emerge from the description and the accompanying drawing.<br>
It is clear that the features mentioned above and those<br>
still to be explained below can be used not only in the<br>
combination indicated in each case but also in other<br>
combinations or individually without leaving the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The invention is now explained by way of example with<br>
reference to a preferred embodiment and the drawing, in<br>
which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic side view of the device<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a diagrammatic illustration of the catch<br>
mechanism;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a diagrammatic top view of the lever arm,<br>
and<br><br>
Figs 4A to 4I show different illustrations of the catch<br>
mechanism in different positions in order to<br>
describe its functioning.<br>
In Fig. 1, a device according to the invention is shown<br>
in a diagrammatic illustration from the side and<br>
designated by reference number 10. The device 10 has an<br>
elongate valve body 12 which has an axial valve body<br>
guide-through (not illustrated). The valve body 12 thus<br>
constitutes a tubular element which is open at both its<br>
ends. A lateral tube 14 is attached in one piece to the<br>
valve body 12 in a central longitudinal region, the<br>
lateral tube 14 extending at an angle to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the valve body, for example at an angle of 45°.<br>
In this connection, the lateral tube 14 runs into the<br>
valve body guide-through.<br>
At a connection end 16, which faces away from the body of<br>
a patient when the device 10 is used as intended, a<br>
rotary cuff 18 is provided, with which the valve body 12<br>
can be closed in a sealed way in a manner known per se<br>
when a guide catheter has been introduced. In an end 20<br>
opposite the connection end 16, which faces the body of a<br>
patient when the device 10 is used as intended, a sealing<br>
arrangement 22 is provided, which consists of a pressure<br>
piston 24 and a sealing stopper provided in the valve<br>
body guide-through and located at the inner end of the<br>
pressure piston 24. The sealing stopper, which cannot be<br>
seen in Fig. 1, is made from an elastic material and has<br>
a continuous opening in the longitudinal direction which<br>
can be closed under pressure load in the longitudinal<br>
direction. This pressure load is applied to the sealing<br>
stopper by means of the pressure piston 24.<br><br>
The device 10 also has a lever arm 26 which is mounted<br>
pivotably about a spindle 28 on the connection end 20.<br>
The lever arm 26 is prestressed into a first end position<br>
shown in Fig. 1 by means of a torsion spring 30. For<br>
this, the torsion spring 30 provided with helical turns<br>
has an end portion 32 which is fixed to the valve body 12<br>
and an end portion which is fixed to a surface of the<br>
lever arm 26 which faces the valve body 12 but cannot be<br>
seen in the figure.<br>
The lever arm 26 can be rotated about the spindle 28 from<br>
the first end position, which is shown, in the direction<br>
of the arrow P into a second end position 34 counter to<br>
the force of the torsion spring 30. Without corresponding<br>
loading of the lever arm 26, it is guided back into the<br>
first end position, which is shown, again by means of the<br>
torsion spring 30.<br>
A component not illustrated in Fig. 1, which interacts<br>
with the pressure piston 24 in such a way that, when the<br>
lever arm 26 is moved into the second end position 34,<br>
the pressure piston 24 is displaced in the longitudinal<br>
direction in order to reduce the load on the sealing<br>
stopper and thus to open the guide-through in the sealing<br>
stopper, is provided on the lever arm 26. In other words,<br>
the pressure piston 24 is pressed so strongly against the<br>
sealing stopper when the prestressed lever arm 26 is in<br>
the first end position that the guide-through is<br>
completely closed.<br>
The purpose of such a medical device is generally known<br>
and is therefore not to be described in greater detail.<br>
Briefly, the device 10 serves for clamping sealingly by<br>
means of the sealing stopper a catheter running through<br><br>
the valve body 12; the clamping force can be reduced, in<br>
order for it to be possible to move the catheter in the<br>
longitudinal direction, by actuating the lever arm 26.<br>
As for the rest, reference is made to WO 01/15768 with<br>
regard to the functioning and the construction of the<br>
valve body 12. The content of the disclosure of this<br>
publication is to this extent included in the present<br>
application by reference.<br>
In order for it to be possible to hold the lever arm 26<br>
in different positions, a catch mechanism 40 is provided,<br>
which comprises an arresting arrangement 42 assigned to<br>
the valve body 12 and a catch tongue arrangement 44<br>
assigned to the lever arm 26.<br>
The arresting arrangement 42 is designed as a plate-<br>
shaped part which is provided on the lateral tube 14. A<br>
number of catch noses 48, three by way of example in the<br>
present embodiment, are provided in the edge region 4 6<br>
facing away from the lateral tube 14.<br>
For its part, the catch tongue arrangement 44 has a catch<br>
tongue 50 which can interact with the catch noses 48. The<br>
catch noses 48 and the catch tongue 50 consequently lie<br>
on a concentric line K around the spindle 28.<br>
The catch tongue arrangement 44 is provided on the lower<br>
side of the lever arm 26 facing the valve body, likewise<br>
in the form of a strip-shaped or plate-shaped element.<br>
The catch mechanism 40 is shown again, separately, in an<br>
enlarged diagrammatic illustration in Fig. 2. In this<br>
connection, the view is from the connection end 20, so<br>
that the plate-shaped part of the arresting arrangement<br><br>
42, which is designated by reference number 52, conceals<br>
a portion of the edge region. This is illustrated by the<br>
dotted line and the slightly lighter hatching of the edge<br>
region 46.<br>
The catch tongue 50 of the catch tongue arrangement 44 is<br>
designed as a triangular component, for example, which<br>
projects in relation to the basic body 54 of the catch<br>
tongue arrangement 44. With respect to the drawing plane<br>
in Fig. 2, the catch tongue 50 thus lies in front of the<br>
basic body 54. The catch tongue 50 has a catching surface<br>
56 and a surface 58 extending at an angle thereto. The<br>
catching surface 56 extends approximately on a radial<br>
line in relation to the spindle 28.<br>
The arresting arrangement 42 has the said three catch<br>
noses 48, which are designed as triangular recesses in<br>
the edge region 46. The triangular recesses each have a<br>
catching surface 60, these surfaces being approximately<br>
parallel to the catching surface 56.<br>
The catch tongue 50 and the catch noses 48 are<br>
dimensioned in such a way that the catching surface 56<br>
can in each case interact with the catching surface 60 of<br>
the three catch noses 48 over as full an area as<br>
possible. In order to facilitate release of the catch<br>
connection, each catch nose 48 has a surface 62 extending<br>
downward to the left at an angle in relation to the<br>
catching surface 60. This surface 62 interacts with the<br>
surface 58 extending at an angle of the catch tongue 50<br>
in such a way that the catch tongue arrangement 44 is<br>
moved out of the catch nose 4 8 when a downward movement<br>
takes place.<br><br>
In order to ensure that the catch tongue 50 passes into<br>
the upper catch nose 48 when the lever arm 26 is moved<br>
out of the first end position, the edge region has an<br>
upper edge surface 64 falling to the left at an angle<br>
(related to the illustration shown in Fig. 2). This edge<br>
surface 64 prevents the catch nose 50 passing onto the<br>
rear side 66, facing away from the catch noses 48, of the<br>
edge region 46 when the lever arm 26 is moved out of the<br>
first end position.<br>
An edge surface 68 which (related to the illustration in<br>
Fig. 2) falls to the left at an angle is likewise<br>
provided at the lower end of the edge region 46. The<br>
purpose of this edge surface 68 is to guide the catch<br>
nose arrangement 44 onto the rear side 66 after the<br>
lowest catch nose 48 has been passed and the actuating<br>
force has been released. In this connection, the catching<br>
surface 56 of the catch tongue 50 slides along the edge<br>
surface 68.<br>
With the aid of this catch mechanism, it is consequently<br>
possible to lock the lever arm 26 in three predetermined<br>
catching positions and to bring it back into the<br>
original, first end position by pressing the lever arm 26<br>
into the lower, second end position 34 and then releasing<br>
it. In this connection, the spring force acting on the<br>
lever arm 26 causes the catch tongue 50 to slide along<br>
the lower edge surface 68 and to be guided onto the rear<br>
side 66 of the arresting arrangement 42. As there are no<br>
catch noses here, the lever arm 26 can pivot back into<br>
the first end position unhindered.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the lever arm 26 in an enlarged diagrammatic<br>
illustration. In this connection, it can be seen that the<br>
lever arm 26 has an elongated hole 70, through which the<br><br>
lateral tube 14 extends. Moreover, the lever arm 26 has a<br>
recessed grip 72, which ends at the edge 74 illustrated.<br>
Fig. 3 also shows that the lateral tube 14 has two<br>
laterally provided webs 76 which lie in a radial plane<br>
(related to the lateral tube 14). The dimension in the<br>
radial direction (in relation to the lateral tube 14) is<br>
selected in such a way that the webs 76 end shortly<br>
before the respective edge of the elongated hole 70.<br>
These webs 76 are intended to prevent the lever arm 26<br>
being capable of moving at right angles to the<br>
longitudinal axis. This is because such a movement at<br>
right angles (parallel to the spindle 28) could result in<br>
the catch tongue 50 coming out of a catch nose 48 as<br>
catch nose 48 and catch tongue 50 extend in this<br>
direction (at right angles to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the valve body). The webs 76 consequently serve for<br>
guiding the lever arm 26 in a plane of rotation. As<br>
emerges from Fig. 1, the webs 76 extend longitudinally in<br>
relation to the lateral tube 14 in the direction of the<br>
valve body 12.<br>
The functioning of the catch mechanism 40 is explained<br>
again, in detail, in Figs 4A to 4I. For simplification,<br>
however, the reference numbers used in Fig. 2 have not<br>
been shown again. In this connection, the sequence of the<br>
positions illustrated in Figs 4A to 41 corresponds to a<br>
movement of the lever arm 26 from the first, upper end<br>
position into the second, lower end position 34 and back<br>
into the first end position again. Fig. 4B shows the<br>
catch tongue arrangement 44 in a first catching position,<br>
Fig. 4D in a second catching position and Fig. 4E in a<br>
third catching position. If the lever arm 26 is pressed<br>
further in the direction of the valve body 12 counter to<br>
the spring force 30, the catch tongue 50 passes onto the<br><br>
edge surface 68, as illustrated in Fig. 4F, and slides<br>
along this onto the rear side 66 of the arresting<br>
arrangement 42 when the lever arm 26 is released. On this<br>
rear side 66, the catch tongue 50 then slides upward back<br>
into the first end position, as illustrated in Figs 4G to<br>
41.<br>
As the lever arm 26 and thus the catch tongue 50 cannot<br>
be moved in the direction of the spindle 28, which is<br>
prevented by the webs 76, the lever arm 26 can be brought<br>
back into the first end position from any of the catching<br>
positions only by movement into the second end position<br>
34. It is consequently not possible to move back directly<br>
into the first end position from a catching position.<br>
As the user of the device 10 accordingly has to perform<br>
only one movement of the lever arm 26 for catching and<br>
releasing the lever arm, operation is especially easy.<br><br>

are designed as a one-piece component.<br><br><br><br>
Abstract<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a device for handling a catheter<br>
with an elongate valve body (12), a lever arm (26) which<br>
is prestressed by means of a spring element and mounted<br>
pivotably on the valve body (12) so as to be pivotable<br>
from a first end position into a second end position (34)<br>
counter to the prestressing force of the spring element,<br>
a pressure piston (24) which is received in the valve<br>
body (12) and can be moved in the longitudinal direction<br>
by means of the lever arm (26) in order to open a sealing<br>
element in the valve body (12) when the lever arm (26) is<br>
moved in the direction of the second end position (34),<br>
and a catch mechanism (40) which has an arresting<br>
arrangement (42) and a catch tongue (50) interacting<br>
therewith in order to hold the lever arm (26) in at least<br>
one catching position. The catch mechanism (40) is<br>
designed in such a way that the arresting arrangement<br>
(42) and the catch tongue (50) come out of engagement<br>
when the second end position (34) of the lever arm (26)<br>
is reached, so that the spring element guides the lever<br>
arm (26) back into the first end position (Fig. 1).</td>
