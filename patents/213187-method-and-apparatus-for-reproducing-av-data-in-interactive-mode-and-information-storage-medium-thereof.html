"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REPRODUCING AV DATA IN INTERACTIVE MODE, AND INFORMATION STORAGE MEDIUM THEREOF"<br>
SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., of 416, Maetan-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
2<br>
Description <br>
METHOD   AND   APPARATUS   FOR   REPRODUCING   AV DATA   IN   INTERACTIVE   MODE,   AND   INFORMATION<br>
STORAGE   MEDIUM   THEREOF<br>
Technical   Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for preloading Enhanced<br>
Navigation (ENAV) data required for seamless reproduction of audio/video (AV) data in an improved navigation mode (hereinafter referred to as an 'ENAV mode'), to a buffer and reproducing the preloaded ENAV data, and an information storage medium thereof.<br>
Background   Art<br>
[2]	Personal computer (PC)-based digital versatile discs (DVDs), i.e., interactive<br>
DVDs, capable of reproducing AV data in an interactive mode have been placed on the market. On an interactive DVD, AV data is recorded according to a general DVD-Video standard and data is further recorded to support an ENAV mode. The AV data recorded on the interactive-DVD can be displayed in two modes: a video mode in which AV data is displayed with the same method of displaying data recorded on a general DVD, and an ENAV mode in which the AV data is reproduced and displayed in a window defined in a markup document. When a user selects the ENAV mode, a browser built in a personal computer (PC) interprets and displays ENAV data recorded on the interactive DVD. In the ENAV mode, a screen is displayed as defined in the markup document and/or an application program while the AV data, which is selected by the user, is included in the screen. A representative example of the ENAV data is the markup document described using a markup language.<br>
[3]	If the AV data is a movie title, a movie screen is displayed in a part of a markup<br>
screen where the markup document is interpreted and displayed, the movie screen being embedded into the markup screen, and various additional information, such as a script and plot of the movie and photos of related actors and actresses, regarding the movie is displayed in the other part of the markup screen. The additional information includes various resource files such as image files and text files. The displayed markup document enables interaction with the user. For instance, when the user clicks a button in the markup screen, the profile of an actor appearing in the movie screen can be displayed.<br>
[4]	However, in the ENAV mode, it is required for a DVD drive installed in the PC to<br><br>
read ENAV data from the interactive DVD and store the ENAV data in a buffer while reading the AV data from the interactive DVD and storing it in the buffer. Accordingly, it is difficult to reproduce the AV data without a pause. That is, seamless reproduction of the AV data is not guaranteed. <br>
Disclosure   of  Invention<br>
Technical   Solution<br>
[5]	The invention provides an apparatus and method for preloading ENAV data to a<br>
buffer and reproducing the preloaded ENAV data for seamless reproduction of the AV data in an ENAV mode using the ENAV data, and an information storage medium thereof.<br>
[6]	According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an information storage<br>
medium comprising AV data; and at least one ENAV application including at least one ENAV file, the ENAV file being reproduced together with the AV data, wherein the ENAV application includes a loading information file, which includes preload information specifying the location of the ENAV file to be buffered before reproduction of the ENAV application, as the ENAV file.<br>
[7]	The loading information file may further include post load information that<br>
specifies the location of the ENAV file to be buffered during reproduction of the ENAV application.<br>
[8]	The loading information file may be linked to a startup file, linked to an ENAV file<br>
constituting a different ENAV application, or designated through an API recorded in an ENAV file constituting a different ENAV application.<br>
Advantageous   Effects<br>
[9]	According to the present invention, seamless reproduction of AV data can be<br>
performed through preloading of ENAV files belonging to an ENAV application for the AV data. Further, the present invention clearly describes a process of preloading of ENAV files operation by operation, thereby enabling compatibility of preloading with respect to a reproducing apparatus and an information storage medium thereof.<br>

Best   Mode<br>
[21]	According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of reproducing<br>
AV data in an ENAV mode, the method including reading a loading information file;<br>
parsing the loading information file; interpreting the verified loading information file<br>
and transmitting preload information, which specifies the location of an ENAV file to<br>
be preloaded, to a buffer manager; and the buffer manager controlling an ENAV buffer<br>
to preload ENAV files before reproduction of a related ENAV application, based on<br>
the received preload information.<br>
[22]	The method may further include generating a preload trigger after completing the<br>
preloading of the ENAV file.<br>
[23]	The method may further include reproducing the related ENAV application using<br>
buffered ENAV files and displaying related AV data in an ENAV mode.<br>
[24]	Reproducing the related ENAV application may further include first parsing an<br>
initial ENAV file and then parsing other ENAV files, and creating a document object<br>
model tree and interpreting and executing the document object model tree according to<br>
a document life cycle.<br>
[25]	Interpreting the verified loading information file may further include transmitting<br>
post load information, which specifies the location of an ENAV file to be post loaded,<br>
to the buffer manager.<br><br>
5<br>
[26]	According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a reproducing<br>
apparatus including a reader that reads AV data from a disc, an AV reproducing engine that decodes the AV data read by the reader, and an ENAV engine that interprets and executes ENAV files from the disc using the reader and allows the ENAV files to be displayed together with the AV data decoded by the AV reproducing engine. The ENAV engine preloads ENAV files required for seamless reproduction of the AV data as the ENAV files, based on preload information recorded in a loading information file.<br>
[27]	The ENAV engine may include an ENAV buffer to which the ENAV files are<br>
preloaded, a buffer manager that controls the ENAV buffer based on the preload information, a parser that verifies the loading information file, an interpreter that interprets the preload information from the verified loading information file, and an interface handler that transmits the preload information from the interpreter to the buffer manager.<br>
[28]	The buffer manager may produce and output a preload trigger, which indicates<br>
completing of the preloading of the ENAV files, to the interface handler after the preloading. The interface handler may convert the preload trigger into an event and transmit the event to the interpreter. After receiving the event, the interpreter may instruct the parser that an initial ENAV file among ENAV files buffered to the ENAV buffer should be first parsed and then the other ENAV files should be buffered to the ENAV buffer.<br>
[29]	Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the<br>
description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.<br>
Mode   for   Invention<br>
[30]	Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
[31]	FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a disc 100 on which audio/video (AV) data is<br>
recorded, according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 1, ENAV data is recorded on the disc 100 to reproduce the AV data in an ENAV mode, the AV data being recorded as Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) bit streams in the tracks of the disc 100 and ENAV files including the ENAV data further being recorded. The ENAV file includes a markup document, image files, animation files, and sound files<br><br>
that are linked to the markup document, reproduced and displayed together with the markup document. It is understood that, the markup document includes one of the following: (i) a document described using a markup language, such as an Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) or a Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL), (ii) a document described using a program language, such as a script language, which is linked to or embedded with a program code, and (iii) Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that define the style of the markup document. That is, the ENAV file not only acts as an application required to reproduce the AV data in the ENAV mode but also provides additional contents that are displayed together with the AV data.<br>
[32]	FIG. 2 is a reference diagram illustrating the relationship between the AV data and<br>
ENAV data recorded on the disc 100 of FIG. 1 for seamless reproduction of the AV data in an ENAV mode. Referring to FIG. 2, ENAV applications correspond to related AV data and provide a seamless reproduction of the AV data. An ENAV application indicates at least one group of ENAV files. In other words, preloading of a corresponding ENAV application is required for the seamless reproduction of the AV data. Here, the preloading denotes reading a necessary ENAV application from the disc 100 and storing it in a buffer before reproduction of the AV data in an ENAV mode.<br>
[33]	Each ENAV application includes a loading information file that specifies preload<br>
information, i.e., location information regarding an ENAV file that is to be buffered before a launching of a related ENAV application, wherein the preload information is necessary for the preloading of the ENAV application.<br>
[34]	The preloading is performed for every ENAV application, such that the seamless<br>
reproduction of the AV data corresponding to each ENAV application can be guaranteed. Therefore, a producer should produce contents in which one ENAV application corresponds to a part and a chapter of a video title for the seamless reproduction of AV data, according to an user interface.<br>
[35]	In connection with the preloading, post loading buffers a predetermined ENAV file<br>
after the launching of a corresponding ENAV application. However, the ENAV application does not always have an ENAV file to be post loaded. When post loading is required, post loading information, i.e., location information of an ENAV file to be post loaded, which is required for the post loading is further included in the loading information file.<br>
[36]	FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram illustrating a volume space of the disc 100 of<br><br>
7<br>
FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 3 the volume space of the disc 100 includes a volume and file structure zone having information regarding disc volumes and files, a DVD-Video data zone having AV data described in a DVD-Video format, and an ENAV file zone supporting an ENAV mode.<br>
[37]	In the DVD-Video data zone, data VIDEO_TS.IFO having reproduction control in-<br>
formation regarding all video titles of recorded information on the disc 100, data VTS_.01_0.IFO having reproduction control information regarding a first video title, and data VTS_0l_0.VOB and VTS_01_1.VOB that are AV data constituting respective video titles, are recorded. The data VTS_01_0.VOB, VTS_01_0.VOB denote video titles, i.e., video objects (VOBs). Each VOB includes VOBU that is packed with a navigation pack, a video pack, and an audio pack (see a DVD-Video Standard 'DVD-Video for Read Only Memory Disc 1.0' for more details).<br>
[38]	An ENAV application having a plurality of ENAV files is stored in the ENAV file<br>
zone. That is, a startup file that is first read when the ENAV mode is selected and a markup document corresponding to a selected video title are recorded as ENAV files. It is understood that the ENAV application may have only one ENAV file.<br>
[39]	FIG. 4 illustrates a directory structure of the disc of FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 4, a<br>
DVD video directory VIDEO _TS and an ENAV directory DVD JEN AV for ENAV data supporting an ENAV mode each stem from a root directory.<br>
[40]	In the DVD video directory VIDEO _TS, data VIDEOJ_TS.IFO, VTS_01_0.1FO, and<br>
VTS_01_0.VOB, VTS_01_1.VOB, ..., which are described with reference to FIG. 3 are stored. In the ENAV directory DVD_ENAV, a startup file STARTUP.MLS and other ENAV files, which are also explained with reference to FIG. 3 are stored.<br>
[41]	FIG. 5 is a schematic view of a reproducing system according to an aspect of the<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 5, the reproducing system includes a disc 100, a reproducing apparatus 200, and a display device 300 that is a display according to this embodiment, and a controller 400. It is understood that the display device may be a television (TV) and the controller may be a remote control layer. The controller 400 receives a control command from a user and sends it to the reproducing apparatus 200. A DVD drive, which reads data recorded on the disc 100, is installed in the reproducing apparatus 200. When the DVD 100 is loaded into the DVD drive and the user selects an ENAV mode, the reproducing apparatus 200 reproduces AV data in the ENAV mode using a corresponding ENAV file and sends the reproduced AV data to the display device 300. Then, an AV screen made by the reproduction of the AV data and a markup screen obtained from a markup document are displayed on the display<br><br>
device 300The ENAV mode indicates a mode in which the AV data is reproduced such that the AV screen is displayed in a window defined in the markup document, i.e., the AV screen is displayed while being embedded into the markup screen. Here, the AV screen indicates a screen in a display in which the AV data is reproduced and displayed, and the markup screen is a screen of the display in which the markup document is interpreted and the result of interpretation is displayed. A video mode is a mode in which the AV data is reproduced using a conventional method of reproducing DVD-Video, that is, only an AV screen obtained by reproducing AV data is displayed.<br>
[42]	The reproducing apparatus 200 supports both the ENAV mode and the video mode.<br>
In particular, according to an aspect of the invention, a related ENAV application is preloaded from the disc 100 and preloaded ENAV files are interpreted and executed, in order to guarantee seamless reproduction of AV data.<br>
[43]	The reproducing apparatus 200 may also access the Internet or a network to<br>
perform post loading.<br>
[44]	FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of the reproducing apparatus 200<br>
according to an aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 6, the reproducing apparatus 200 is an apparatus supporting the video mode and the ENAV mode and includes a reader 1, an AV reproducing engine 2, and an ENAV engine 3. The reader 1 controls an optical pickup (not shown) and reads AV data and ENAV data from the disc 100, in response to a control signal from the ENAV engine 3 or the AV reproducing engine 2.<br>
[45]	The ENAV engine 3 is an interpretation engine that interprets and executes a<br>
markup language and a script language in order to support the ENAV mode, i.e., to make a presentation of ENAV files read by the reader 1. The ENAV engine 3 further includes a variety of plug-ins. A plug-in allows various format files, which are included in or linked to a markup document, to be open. That is, the ENAV engine 3 acts as a viewer of the markup document. Also, the ENAV engine 3 according to this embodiment accesses the Internet to read ENAV data therefrom.<br>
[46]	The AV reproducing engine 2 decodes a video title selected in the ENAV mode and<br>
transmits a decoded AV data stream to the ENAV engine 3. The ENAV engine 3 interprets the markup document, combines the AV data stream with the markup document that undergoes rendering so that the AV data stream can be displayed in a window defined in the markup document, i.e., the AV screen is embedded into the markup screen, and outputs the result of blending to the display device 100.<br>
[47]	In particular, for seamless reproduction of the AV data, the ENAV engine 3<br>
preloads the ENAV files to a buffer (not shown) of the ENAV engine 3 and interprets<br><br>
the preloaded ENAV files before the AV data is reproduced. That is, the ENAV engine 3 obtains information regarding ENAV files to be preloaded from a loading information file read from the disc 100 and then performs the preloading. A detailed description of the loading information file will be later described.<br>
[48]	FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of the ENAV engine 3 shown in<br>
FIG. 5. Referring to FIG. 7, the ENAV engine 3 includes an interface handler 31, a buffer manager 32, an ENAV buffer 33, a parser 34, and an interpreter 35.<br>
[49]	The ENAV buffer 33 buffers ENAV files under the control of the buffer manager<br>
32, and particularly, preloads the ENAV files based on a loading information file, for seamless reproduction of AV data. Further, during post loading, the ENAV buffer 33 buffers the ENAV files to be post loaded.<br>
[50]	The parser 34 verifies the availability of a predetermined format ENAV file<br>
preloaded to the ENAV buffer 33 according to a predetermined standard and converts the format of the ENAV file so that the interpreter 35 can read the ENAV file. For instance, when the ENAV file is a markup document, the parser 34 verifies the availability of the ENAV file according to a Data Type Definition (DTD) and produces a document object model tree.<br>
[51]	The document object model tree is produced under the following conditions: the<br>
root node of all nodes is set as a document node; all texts and elements generate nodes; and processing instructions, comments, and document type generate nodes. In the case of a style sheet, the style sheet is interpreted and style rules/selector lists are created. The style sheet allows a free setting of the style of a markup document. For example, in FIG. 7, the grammar and format of the style sheet are set according to the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) of W3C.<br>
[52]	The interpreter 35 receives, interprets, and executes the ENAV file from the parser<br>
34. The interpretation and execution of the ENAV file are based on a document life cycle disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 2002-31069 entitled 'Method and Apparatus for Reproducing AV Data in Interactive Mode Using Markup Document', filed on June 3 2002, and Korean Patent Application No 2002-70014 entitled 'Method and Apparatus for Reproducing AV Data in Interactive Mode Using Markup Document', filed on November 12, 2002. The interface handler 31 controls an interface between the AV reproducing engine 2 and the interpreter 35. In other words, the interface handler 31 receives triggers from a user or a computer, the AV reproducing engine 2, the buffer manager 32, and the interpreter 35 and converts them into related events.<br><br>
10<br>
[53]	FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate a loading information file according to an aspect of the<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 8A, the loading information file is linked to a startup file that is first read during initialization of a disc performed when the disc 100 is inserted into the reproducing apparatus 200 or the reproducing apparatus 200 is turned on.<br>
[54]	FIG. 8B shows an embodiment of the loading information shown in FIG. 8A.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, a startup file STARTUP.MLS includes an element 'loadinginfo' having an attribute value specifying the location of the loading information file. In FIG. 8B, A indicates the recording position of a location information regarding the loading information file, when the name attribute and value of an element 'condition' are 'lang' (i.e., language) and 'en' (i.e., English) and the name attribute and value of an element 'condition' are 'profile' (i.e., standard specification information) and '00' that is a version number, respectively. B indicates the recording position of the location information when the attributes and values of the element 'condition' are different from the above description.<br>
[55]	FIGS. 9A, 9B, 10A, and 10B illustrate a loading information file according to<br>
another aspect of the invention. The loading information file includes a list of ENAV files to be preloaded or post loaded, the ENAV files are included in an ENAV application to which the loading information file belongs. Therefore, as described with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B, a loading information file is selected using a startup file and ENAV files are loaded into the ENAV buffer 33 based on the selected loading information file when the disc 100 is inserted into the reproducing apparatus 200 or the reproducing apparatus 200 is turned on. However, the startup file cannot be used to change ENAV applications during reproduction of AV data; therefore, a new loading file must be obtained.<br>
[56]	Referring to FIG. 9A, ENAV files belonging to an ENAV application includes an<br>
anchor element linked to a loading information file related to another ENAV application. That is, the anchor element is linked to the loading information file through a tag <a href="#">,</a>.<br>
[57]	FIG. 9B illustrates an embodiment of the linkage of the loading information file<br>
belonging to another ENAV application illustrated in FIG. 9A. If a user executes a hyperlink reading 'New Loading information', a new loading information file is transmitted to the parser 34.<br>
[58]	Referring to FIG. 10A, an API that calls up a loading information file related to a<br>
different ENAV application is recorded in a last ENAV file belonging to an ENAV application.<br><br>
[59]	FIG. 10B illustrates an embodiment of the linkage of the loading information file<br>
belonging to another ENAV application illustrated in FIG. 10A. Referring to FIG. 10B, when a script code (API) is executed, a new loading information file is transmitted to the parser 34.<br>
[60]	FIG. 11 illustrates a loading information file Loading lnformation.ldi according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, the loading information file includes as basic information the list of ENAV files to be preloaded to the ENAV buffer 33 before the launching of a corresponding ENAV application, and also includes the list of ENAV files to be loaded, i.e., post loaded, to the ENAV buffer 33 after the preloading of the ENAV files.<br>
[61]	In the loading information file, an element 'manifest' is used as a root element of the<br>
loading information file and two different types of an element 'entityset' are present. The first element 'entityset' includes the list of ENAV files to be preloaded and the second element 'entityset' includes the list of ENAV files to be post loaded. The location of ENAV files is indicated with an attribute 'xml:base' in each of the elements 'entityset'. Also, the location of each ENAV file is indicated with an element 'initial' or an element 'entity'. The element 'initial' designates a markup document that should be first executed after the preloading. It is required that the elements 'initial' and 'entity' include an attribute 'href that designates the location of ENAV file.<br>
[62]	Hereinafter, a method of reproducing AV in an ENAV mode data according to the<br>
invention is described.<br>
[63]	FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating a method of reproducing AV data according to an<br>
aspect of the invention. Referring to FIG. 12, when a loading information file is loaded to the ENAV buffer 33, as described with reference to FIGS. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B, 9A, and 9B, the parser 34 reads the loading information file from the ENAV buffer 33 (operation 1201). The parser 34 parses the loading information file to verify its availability (operation 1202). The parser 34 transmits the verified loading information file to the interpreter 35, the interpreter 35 interprets the loading information file and sends preload information (and/or post load information), i.e., location information of ENAV file, to the interface handler 31, and the interface handler 31 sends the preload information to the buffer manager 32 (operation 1203). Then, the buffer manager 32 controls the ENAV buffer 33 according to information regarding an ENAV file to be preloaded out of the received preload information, and the ENAV buffer 33 reads the ENAV file from the disc 100 or a network (operation 1204). The buffer manager 32 determines the status of the ENAV buffer 33 so as to determine whether the preloading<br><br>
of the ENAV file is completed and generates and outputs a preload trigger indicating the completing of the preloading to the interface handler 31 (operation 1205). The interface handler 31 converts the preload trigger into an event indicating the completing of the preloading and sends the event to the interpreter 35.<br>
[64]	After the preloading, ENAV files, including an initial ENAV file, which must be<br>
first reproduced by the ENAV engine 3, are loaded to the ENAV buffer 33. The initial ENAV file is a markup document designated by an element 'initial'. When the interpreter 35 receives the event made according to a buffer trigger indicating the completing of preloading, the interpreter 35 allows the parser 34 to read the initial ENAV file from the ENAV buffer 33 so as to determine the availability of the initial ENAV file and then receive, interpret, and execute the verified initial ENAV file (operation 1206). After the execution of the initial ENAV file, the ENAV files are also interpreted and executed using the same method.<br>
[65]	When there are ENAV files to be post loaded after operation 1205, i.e., during re-<br>
production of ENAV files that were preloaded and buffered, the ENAV files are continuously loaded to the ENAV buffer 33. That is, the ENAV buffer 33 buffers ENAV files received via a network under control of the buffer manager 32. After the post loading, the buffer manager 32 sets a status 'allDone' indicating the status of the ENAV buffer 33 as TRUE.'<br>
[66]	When there are no ENAV files to be post loaded after operation 1205, the ENAV<br>
manager 32 sets the status 'allDone' as 'TRUE' so as to indicate completing of loading of ENAV files. That is, the ENAV buffer 33 buffers ENAV files received via a network under control of the buffer manager 32. After the post loading, the buffer manager 32 sets a status 'allDone' indicating the status of the ENAV buffer 33 as 'TRUE'. The interpreter 35 can check whether the loading of ENAV files is complete using an allDone API as a property.<br>
[67]	A method of reproducing AV data in the interactive mode according to the<br>
invention can be performed as a computer program. Codes and code segments constituting the program can be derived by a computer programmer in this field. In addition, the method may be performed in the interactive mode by storing the program in a computer readable medium and having a computer read and execute the program. The computer readable medium may be a magnetic recording medium, an optical recording medium, or a carrier wave mediun.<br>
[68]	As described above, according to the present invention, seamless reproduction of<br>
AV data can be performed through preloading of ENAV files belonging to an ENAV<br><br>
application for the AV data. Further, the present invention clearly describes a process<br>
of preloading of ENAV files operation by operation, thereby enabling compatibility of<br>
preloading with respect to a reproducing apparatus and an information storage medium<br>
thereof.<br>
[69]	Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and<br>
described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
