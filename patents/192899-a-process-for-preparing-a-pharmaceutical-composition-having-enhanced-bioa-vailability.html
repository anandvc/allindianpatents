				<td> <br><br><br><br>
The  invention relates  to  a  process  for preparing a pharmaceutical  composition having enhanced  bioavailability.<br>
It is well known in the art that a wide range of diseases are caused   by   retroviruses.<br>
As far as is known at the present, AIDS is a disease of the immune  system  caused  by  the  retrovirus  HIV  (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).     According to estimates by the World Health Organization,  the  disease, which  affects  about  10 million people, is continuing to spread and in virtually all cases results in the death of the patient.<br>
Retroviruses  HIV-1   and HIV-2 have been identified as  a cause of the  disease  and they  have  been characterized by  molecular biology.<br>
Retroviral protease  is  a proteolytic enzyme that,  owing to  an aspartate  residue  in  the   active  center,  is  regarded  as  an  aspartate protease  and  participates  in  the  maturation  of new  infectious   virions in infected cells in the reproductive cycle of a number of retroviruses.<br>
For example, HIV-1  and HIV-2 each have in their genome a region that codes for a "gag-protease".    That "gag-protease" is responsible for  the correct proteolytic  cleavage  of the precursor proteins  that are  produced from the genome  regions  coding for the "Group Specific Antigens"  (gag).    During the cleavage, the structural proteins of the  virus core are liberated.    The  "gag-protease"  itself is a component of a precursor protein encoded by the  pol-genome region of HIV-1  and HIV-2, which protein also contains  the regions for the  "reverse  transcriptase"  and  the  "integrase"  and is  thought to be   cleaved  by   autoproteolysis.<br><br>
The "gag-protease" cleaves the major core protein p24 of HIV-1   and HIV-2 preferentially N-terminally of proline residues,  for example in the divalent residues Phe-Pro, Leu-Pro, or Tyr-Pro.    It is a protease having  a catalytically  active aspartate residue in the active  center,  a  so-called  aspartate  protease.<br>
As  used herein, proteinase inhibitor refers to those compounds which inhibit aspartate proteases of viral origin and which are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections caused by retroviruses,  such as HIV,  in mammals, both human and non-human. Details of the design of such proteinase inhibitors can be found, for example, in Roberts, N.A., et al., Science. 248. 358 (20 April 1990); Overton, H.A., et al., Virologv. 179. 508 (1990); Tucker, T.J., et al., L Med.  Chem.. 35. 2525 (1992); and Phylip, L.H., et al, FEES Letters. 314.  449 (1992).<br>
Because of the hydrophobic  and/or lipophilic character of proteinase   inhibitors,   pharmaceutical   formulations   thereof  with conventional solid or liquid pharmaceutical excipients  tend to  have disadvantages.  For example  the  proteinase  inhibitor may  not be satisfactorily  absorbed.     Among  the inherent factors known to  affect absorption  are  the method of manufacture  or method of compounding; the particle size and crystal form or polymorph of the drug  substance;  and the diluents and excipients used in formulating the  dosage form,  including carriers,  fillers,  binders,  disintegrating agents,  lubricants,  coatings,  solvents,  suspending agents,  and dyes.<br>
A "requirement  for  therapeutic  effectiveness   in  vivo   is the achievement of good bioavailability,  for example  good  absorptive capacity and/or a high blood level, also in the case of enteral, such as oral,  administration, in order to obtain sufficiently high concentrations  in the infected cells and/or good distribution within a host in need of treatment.<br>
An additional requirement is  that the unit dosage  form have good stability or shelf life so that it can be stored conveniently (e.g., no refrigeration, i.e., at room temperature (--20 °C) for a long period of time (e.g., about two years).<br><br>
While there are many known proposals to alleviate or overcome problems of this type, it has been found that many of these proposals  are inadequate in  the  area of the proteinase inhibitors.     It has, however,  surprisingly been found  that certain classes  of glycerides used as carrier components of formulation do assist in alleviating these inadequacies.     In particular,  they enable achievement  of better  absorption   and  thus   enhanced  bioavailability and have good stability or shelf life over a long period of time.<br>
The  present  invention  accordingly  provides   a  pharmaceutical composition, preferably in unit dose, comprising (a) a therapeutically  effective  amount of a proteinase  inhibitor,  its pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  or esters  (including  their salts); and (b) a carrier containing a monoglyceride of Cg-Cio  medium chain fatty acids.    The amount of the monoglyceride in the pharmaceutically  acceptable carrier of component (b)  is  at least sufficient to  dissolve  the  proteinase  inhibitor.<br>
Preferably,  the ratio of monoglyceride of component (b)  to component (a) is at least about 1,5, more preferably at least about 2.0, further preferably at least from about 2.5  to about 3.5, and most preferably at least about 3.    Preferably, component (b) has an acid value of less than or equal to about 0.5, more preferably less than or equal to about 0.26, and further preferably less than or equal to about 0.1  and even more preferably less than or equal to about 0.04.<br>
The medium chain fatty acids can also be partially ethoxylated with polyethylene glycol of molecular weight of from about 300 to about 500, which is equivalent to about six to about eight moles of ethylene   oxide.<br>
Mixtures of the monoglyceride of C8-C10 medium chain fatty acids  and the partially ethoxylated medium chain fatty  acids can also  be  contemplated.<br>
The  pharmaceutically  acceptable  carrier  can  further  contain polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br><br>
The  present  invention  accordingly  provides  a  pharmaceutical composition, preferably in unit dose, comprising (a) a therapeutically  effective   amount of a proteinase  inhibitor,  its pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  or esters   (including  their salts); and (b) a carrier containing a monoglyceride of C8-C1o  medium<br>
chain fatty acids.    The amount of the monoglyceride in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of component (b)  is present in an amount sufficient to dissolve or solubilize the proteinase inhibitor.    Preferably the ratio of monoglyceride (b) to (a) is at least about  1.5. A skilled artisan would be able to determine the amount of monoglyceride that is needed to dissolve the proteinase inhibitor in  accordance  with  the  present invention  through  conventional techniques.<br>

A  human  volunteer  study  was  carried  out using  inventive formulation   A-63   as   compared   against  noninventive   formulation Formulation  A-14  (Compound  A-mesylate  salt,  235.337  mg [equivalent to 200.000 mg of Compound A] in a carrier of anhydrous lactose,  63.300 mg; microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH  102), 60.000 mg;  sodium starch glycolate,   16.000 mg; Povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone)   K30,   8.000  mg;   and  magnesium  stearate, 4.000 mg; (purified water used for processing, 92.590 mg) placed in a  hard  gelatin capsule)   to  assess  bioavailability.<br>
Twelve male volunteers  were  used in each study, each  given the equivalent of 600 mg Compound A after food:    that is three capsules each of the 200 mg hard gelatin capsule Formulation A-14 and three capsules each of the 200 mg soft gelatin capsules of Formulation A-63.    The 200 mg indicating that each capsule, hard or soft, contain the equivalent of 200 mg of Compound A.<br><br>
After a fourteen day screening period, each subject received a single  dose of either inventive formulation Formulation A-63  or non-inventive  formulation  Formulation  A-14  within  five  minutes  of a standardized meal (either (1) breakfast::    bowl of corn flakes with 100 ml of whole milk; two rashers of bacon; two fried eggs; two slices of toast with butter; 100 ml orange juice; and 150 ml of decaffeinated coffee or tea or (2) lunch:    200 ml of soup; sandwiches made from four pieces of bread; a chocolate biscuit; an orange or apple; and  150 ml decaffeinated coffee or tea).<br>
Blood samples were taken immediately before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the dose.    After a minimum six day washout period, each volunteer received a second dose of each relevant formulation  after a standardized meal and blood sampling was done at the times previously  mentioned.     After another minimum  six  day  washout period, each volunteer received a second -dose of each relevant formulation  after a standardized meal  and blood  sampling  was  done at  the   times  previously   mentioned.<br>
The plasma samples of Compound A in biological fluid were analyzed  by  solid  phase  sample  preparation  and  high  performance liquid  chromatography  with  ultraviolet  detector  at  238   nm (HPLC/UV) as described below.<br>
C8  Advanced Automated Sample  Processor (AASP)  cartridges were used to extract Compound A from plasma samples.    The limits of quantification were 0.5 ng/ml with  1.0 ml of plasma with a precision and accuracy of 0.5% and 99.1%, respectively.<br>
Venous blood samples (10 ml) were taken into either glass Becton  Dickinson  Vacutainers  or polypropylene  Sarstadt  monovettes containing lithium heparin as an anticoagulant, and put on ice.    The samples were centrifuged within  1  hour of collection at  1500 g and the plasma transferred to 5  ml polystyrene  screw  top  tubes  and stored frozen at -20°'C.    Prior to transfer to the analytical laboratory, plasma  samples  from  HIV  positive  patients  were  inactivated  by  heat<br><br>
treatment in a water bath for 2 hours at 56°C (±  1°C) to destroy any HIV present.    The samples were then refrozen at -20°C.    Prior to analysis  at the analytical laboratory,  the samples  were subjected  to the   same  heat  treatment,<br>
A 300 µl aliquot of 0.5 molar monochloroacetic acid was added to each 1 ml aliquot of plasma, standard, or unknown and the samples were vortexed and then centrifuged for 3  minutes in a microfuge (MSE).<br>
Using a AASP prep station (Varian, Walton on Thames, England), .C8  bonded phase AASP cassettes (Jones Chromatography,<br>
Hengoed, Wales) were primed with 2 x 1 ml of methanol and 2.x 1 ml of 0.001 M ammonium acetate (pH 3) buffer.    The plasma samples were then loaded onto the cassette and washed with 2 x  1 ml of 0.01 M ammonium acetate and 1 ml of 0.01 M ammonium acetate (pH 3) buffertmethanol (60:40).    The cassettes were transferred to  the AASP system and the samples eluted into  the HPLC system (Kratos Spectroflow 400 pump, ABI, Warrington, England; AASP mininjector, Varian, Walton on Thames, England; LKB 2141   variable  wavelength  detector,  Pharmacia/LKB,   Milton  Keynes, England),<br>
The AASP cassettes were purged with aliquots of methanol:water:glacial acetic  acid (48.8:48.8:2.4)  set for  10 cycles pre-injection and  10 cycles post-injection.    The valve reset time was sent to 1 minute with a typical cycle time and run time of 15 minutes.<br>
The  eluent was  methanohO.Ol   M  ammonium  acetate:glacial acetic acid (90:9.75:0.25), at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, which resulted in a back pressure of approximately 800 psi,    A Phenyl Nova-Pak Guard-Pak (Waters, Harrow, England) was used with a Phenyl Nova-Pak cartridge (4 micron)  (Waters,  Harrow, England) fitted with in a Waters RCM 8 x  10 compression unit (Waters, Harrow, England). The UV detector was set at 238 nm.    These conditions resulted in a retention time of about 10 minutes for Compound A.    The retention time  was  dependent upon  the  analytical column (due  to  the number<br><br>
of residual silanol groups),  the concentration of ammonium acetate in the mobile phase, and the amount of methanol.    The optimum separation of Compound  A from endogenous components was achieved with a retention time of 10 minutes, accomplished by varying  the  concentration of ammonium  acetate used  to prepare  the mobile phase.    The concentration of ammonium acetate was established for each analytical column and was  between about 0.006 and about 0.019 M.<br>
The peak heights of Compound A were calculated automatically  by  computing integrator (Maxima  820 chromatography  data  acquisition  system.  Waters,  Harrow,  England). Peak heights or peak height ratios versus concentrations of Compound A were used to construct linear calibration curves and calculation of subsequent patient  sample  concentrations  using RODAS suite of programs (Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, England).     Calibration curves were established using an iteratively reweighed linear least squares regression.    The  time for maximum concentration   (Cmax), the time to achieve maximum plasma concentration   Tmax  and area under the plasma concentration - time profile (AUC) was determined from plasma concentration - time profile of each formulation.    Statistical analyses, e.g., mean, % coefficient of variability and median were  also calculated.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition having enhanced bioavailability such as herein described, comprising the step of mixing<br>
(a)	a therapeutically effective amount in the range of 10 mg to 300 mg per unit dosage of a protienase inhibitor N-ter-butyl-decahydes-2-[2-(R&gt; hydroxy-4-phenyl-3(S)-{[-(2-quinolylcarbonyl)"L-asparaginyl]amino} butyl]-(4aS, 8aS)-isoquinoline-3-(S) carboxaiiiide; _   t       •       I<br>
(b)	at least one pharmaceutically acceptable monoglyceride of a C8 to C10 medium chain fatty acid and mixtures thereof, wherein the weight ratio of the said monoglyceride to said proteinase inliibitor is at least l!5; and<br>
(c)	optionallymixingO.Ol to 0.5% by weight of di-α α - tocopherol,    j<br>
Relevant pharmacokinetic parameters of inventive formulation Fomiulation A-63 as compared to noninventive formulation Formulation A-14 are found in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The data of Table 2 show inventive formulation Formulation A-63 shows a Cm ax over five times that of noninventive Formulation A-14.     Inventive  formulation  Formulation  A-63   shows  a AUC over 3.5 times that of noninventive formulation Formulation A-14.    The results of this evaluation were surprising.<br>
The  Compound  A-mesylate  salt  (used  in  non-inventive Formulation A-14) has a greater solubility than Compound A base (2.55 vs. 0.03 mg/ml at room temperature in water; 0.06 vs. 0.05 mg/ml at room temperature in pH 1.1 (HCl); and 2.32 vs   
 <br>
