SPINNING MACHINE WITH SEVERAL DRAFTING DEVICE DRIVES<br>
The following invention relates to a spinning machine with several drafting device drives according to the preamble to the independent Claim.<br>
In the German published application DE 100 40 420 A1, a spinning machine of this type is disclosed with several embodiments of the drafting device drives. The present invention is based on the problem of proposing a space-saving and easily installable design concept for drafting device drives.<br>

According to Fig. 1, located in the upper part of the frame of the spinning machine, above a suction extraction element 30 with a suction channel 32, is a drive 40, which is secured to a carrier element 26. The frame of the spinning machine 10 is formed essentially of plates 12, which are connected by transverse elements 29 or carrier tubes 28. The suction channel 32 can be suspended on a carrier element 26, as represented in diagrammatic form, or supported on the plate 12. A drafting device 20 consists of several rollers 22, which according to the invention are provided with toothed wheels or gear wheels, which are set in rotation by the drives 40. A load-imposing device 24 with pressure rollers ensures that the material which is to be processed is carried along in sympathy in the spinning machine by the rollers 22. The material drawn forwards by the drafting device 20 is rotated and wound up in a spinning device 76, whereby in each case a spinning device located below is allocated to a unit in the drafting device 20. It is understood that on both sides of the mid-plane of the spinning machine are arranged drafting devices 20 as well as spinning devices 76, symmetrical to the mid-plane. In the lower area of the plate 12 are apertures 40 for the bearings of the doffer of the spinning machine 10, details of which are given hereinafter.<br>
As is represented in Fig. 1a, a drive is divided into a motor 42a and a transmission or gear unit 42b, of which the power take-off wheel 46f is connected by means of a toothed belt to a roller with a toothed wheel or gear wheel 22. While the drafting device arrangement 42 according to Fig. 1a is connected by means of at least one holding element 42c to the carrier element 26, as is the arrangement in Fig. 1b, the drafting device arrangement 422, represented by broken lines, is secured by means of a holding element 46d to a carrier tube 28 and by means of a holding device 46d to a transverse element 29. A power takeoff wheel 46f according to Fig. 1a is connected by means of a toothed belt 22z to the roller 22, or more precisely to a toothed wheel or gear wheel secured to the roller. This lowest roller of the drafting device arrangement is designated as the power take-off roller. With regard to the detailed representation of roller arrangements in DE 100 40 420 A1, referred to in the preamble, where rollers are designated by 11 and toothed wheel or gear wheels<br><br>
on such rollers are designated by 27, in this case more detailed representations of this kind have been avoided.<br>
In Fig. 1b a further transmission or gear unit 42b of a drafting device arrangement 42 is shown, whereby the power take-off wheel 46f is connected directly to the roller 22 with the toothed wheel or gear wheel on the intake side of the drafting device 20.<br>
In Fig. 1c a further transmission or gear unit 42b is shown, of which the power take-off wheel 46f is in engagement by means of a toothed wheel or gear wheel with a middle roller 22 located between the feed roller and delivery roller. While in Figs. 1a and 1b a possible securing arrangement is shown for the transmission device 42b on a carrier element 26, the transmission or gear unit 42b in Fig. 1c is secured to a transverse element 29 or a carrier tube 28, which is connected to the carrier element 26, in each case by means of a holding element 46df or 46d respectively. The transmission or gear units 42b, in each case with motors 42a according to Figs. 1a, 1b, 1c, are located in the spinning machine 10 stacked in its longitudinal direction. At least one transmission or gear unit 42b with a motor 42a is connected via a power take-off wheel 46f to one of the rollers 22a of the drafting device. Since, as already mentioned, drafting devices 20 are arranged on both sides of the mid-plane, represented as a broken line in Fig. 1, in each case a transmission or gear unit of the same kind, for example the transmission or gear unit 42b on the lowest roller 22 of the drafting device 20 in Fig. 1a, is present in a double arrangement, since in the spinning machine 10 there is a drafting roller 22a on both sides of the said plane. With longer spinning machines, for example with more than 1,500 spinning positions, a multiple arrangement of transmission or gear units 42b and motors 42a is present, for example that represented in Fig. 1a, in other words 2,4,6 etc. The most heavily loaded roller in particular, the middle roller 22 of the drafting device according to Fig. 1c, is to be driven for preference by several transmission or gear units 42b of the same kind, with motors 42a, as is represented in Fig. 3. The drafting device drives 40 in question are the transmission or gear units arranged at the furthest left and right in the upper part of the Figure, which are connected to the middle roller 22a. This roller 22a can either be continuous, or roller<br><br>
sections separated from one another are used, which in each case are allocated to a drive 40.<br>
Represented in detail in Fig. 2, in the upper part, are a suction device 32 for the drafting device 20, and in the lower part an ancillary drive for the bobbin conveying. As in the view in Fig. 1, this relates to a cross-section through the machine, or a view in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine 10 respectively. Accordingly, a repeated description of identical parts or groupings in the spinning machine 10 has been done without. As can be seen, a channel arranged above the middle of the spinning machine 10 consists of a first part channel 32a, a second part channel 42b, and a third part channel 42c. Suction pipes open into the part channels, such as the suction pipe 32, for example, for suction extraction from the drafting device into the suction channel32c, and the suction pipe 34 for the suction extraction from a compaction device into the middle channel 32b. The part channels are formed from U-shaped curved sheets, whereby the part channels, for example 32a and 32b, are screened off from one another by a separation sheet 32ab. The longitudinal edges of the curved sheets are held together by U-shaped holding devices, as shown. If part sheets 32ab are done without (two such sheets are represented in Fig. 2), a suction channel is obtained without any subdivision. In this case, suction pipes 32 and 34, arranged in each case for one spinning position, open into one and the same channel run.<br>
The drive unit of a doffer, represented in diagrammatic form in the lower part of Fig. 2, consists of a drive roller 50, secured at its upper end to the plate 12, in particular with pneumatic drive, which essentially presses in the vertical direction onto a lever 52 secured at its left end to the plate 12, and draws this upwards in counter-movement. In this situation, link plates 56a and 56b, likewise secured to this lever 52 approximately in the centre, are displaced in the vertical direction inside a window 12a in the plate 12. The lever 52, as can be seen from Fig. 2a, a plan view of the arrangement in Fig. 2, is located running in front of the plate 12 and parallel to its surface. These link plates 56a and 56b are represented in Fig. 2a as broken lines by means of axes 52a, and are connected to the lever 52 and can be pivoted in relation to it. Connected in a pivotable manner by joints to the lower ends of the link plates 56a and 56b, on the power take-off side, are the ends<br><br>
of a first pivot arm 54a and a second pivot arm 54b. The outer end in each case of a pivot arm, 54a and 54b respectively, is connected in a torsionally-resistant manner to a hub 5a and connected to this in the bearing 14 for the doffer, according to Fig. 1a, said hub carrying a doffer arm 5. The arrangements are essentially mirror-symmetrical to the mid-plane, represented by broken lines, through the middle of the machine in Fig. 1 or 2, whereby in each case a pivot arm 54a, 54b, and the elements of the doffer drive itself, connected to the arms in a jointed manner, are arranged on both sides of he plate 12 of the spinning machine 10, as can be seen from Fig. 2a. Because the joint parts of the pivot arms 54a and 54b are located at the link plates 56a and 56b inside the window 12a in the plate 12, the corresponding ends of the first pivot arm 54a and of the second pivot arm 54b are offset. The arrangement is chosen in such a way that the picot arms 54a and 54b are identical in layout, i.e. with offsets effected in the same way at the ends facing the middle of the machine, as represented in Fig. 2a.<br>
In Figs. 1d and 1e a drive unit 40 is represented for a middle roller 22 with a toothed wheel or gear wheel at its circumference, in a view in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine and in the plan view. Secured to a carrier tube 28 of a carrier element 26 for the drafting device 20 is a holding element 42c for the drive 40. This holding element 42c essentially bears the weight of the drive 40, whereby the drive 40 can be pivoted about the carrier tube 28 in the spinning machine 10 without further securing. In addition, support for the drive 40 is provided by a further holding device or devices 43a, 43b and encompasses this roller, at its end 22 facing the roller, by means of bearings 44, represented in Fig. 1e. The adjustability both in the longitudinal direction of the holding elements 43a and transverse to them at the drive 40 is therefore to the purpose, in order for one and the same drive to be connected in jointed fashion to different rollers, of which three each are represented on each side of the machine. The drive 40, as already mentioned in connection with the description of Fig. 1, is essentially divided into a motor 42a, for preference a synchromotor, and a transmission or gear unit 54b, arranged in the same housing, whereby the motor 42a and the transmission or gear unit 42b are connected by a toothed belt drive 45. This toothed belt is represented in Fig. 1e in the lower part by a dotted line, and runs via two spur gears of the motor 42a and the transmission or gear unit<br><br>
42b. The transmission or gear unit 42b is designed for preference as a planetary gear. On the output side of the transmission or gear unit 42b, which is designed as a reduction gear, is an intermediate wheel 46c, which meshes with a power take-off wheel 46b. In Fig. 2 this power take-off wheel 46b is in engagement with a toothed wheel or gear wheel 22 at the middle drafting roller 22. In Fig. 1e the roller is represented with the toothed wheel or gear wheel, which engages with the power take-off wheel 46, in the upper area only by way of a dotted line. The securing of the drive 40 or this drive unit respectively to the carrier tube 28 at one end, and to the drafting roller 22 allocated in each case, allows for a very simple and precise securing beneath the drafting devices, so that optimum conditions are provided for the trouble-free drive of the drafting roller 22a. The rollers of the drafting device 20 can be identified in particular in Fig. 1d, in the upper left part, in a view in the longitudinal direction. While the drafting rollers themselves are represented as solid circles, the toothed wheel or gear wheels distributed over the length in each case on the drives 40 are represented by dotted line circles. According to the material flow direction of the material which is to be spun, obliquely from top to bottom, the rollers are designated one after another as the feed roller 22a, the middle roller, and the delivery roller. The drive 40 represented in Fig. 1d is, as can be seen, connected to the right middle roller of the spinning machine 10, in which the power take-off wheel 46b of the drive is in engagement with the toothed wheel or gear wheel 22. The traverse element 29 between the plate 12 and the carrier element 26 have been mentioned in connection with the Figure Description of Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1f, a further drive 40 of the spinning machine 10 is represented, similar to the arrangement in Fig. 1d, whereby this drive 40 is connected on the take-offside by means of its power take-off wheel 46f, by means of a toothed belt drive, to a toothed wheel or gearwheel 22a1 of the right delivery roller. This drive 40, according to Fig. 1f, is essentially of the same design structure as the drive represented in Fig. 1d, with the difference that the power take-off wheel 46f is not, as in Fig. 1b, in direct engagement with the toothed wheel or gear wheel 22a' of the corresponding drafting roller allocated to it, but is only connected via the toothed belt of the toothed belt drive 45 in Fig. 1f. The arrangement of a toothed belt according to Fig. 1f is therefore advantageous for the delivery roller at 22a <br>
because irregularities in the rotational movement of the power take-off wheel 46f are not absorbed directly at the corresponding toothed wheel or gearwheel 22a1 of the delivery roller, but in a damped manner, and are therefore scarcely transferred at all, which has an advantageous effect on the yarn quality. The material flow direction of the fibre structure is reproduced in Fig. 1f by arrows on the intake side of the drafting roller 22a. The various different drafting rollers of the drafting device are referred to, in accordance with the material flow direction, as the feed roller 22a, middle roller 22b, and delivery roller 22c, as indicated in the left-hand part of Fig. 1f. The material flow direction with a double-sided machine, as represented in the Figs. 1, is in each case obliquely from top to bottom along the drafting roller.<br>
Fig. 1g shows the transmission layout of a drive unit 40, as well as its suspension on one side at the carrier tube 28 by means of a holding element 42 as well as, on the other side, the securing to a roller 22a of the drafting device 20 by means of further holding elements 43a, 43b, which at their ends encompass bearings 44, which run on the roller 22a. These are for preference roller bearings, which are secured on sections or on a section of the drafting roller 22a, of which the outer rings are surrounded by the further holding elements 43a, 43b. The outlines of the drive unit 40 are represented by broken lines, for example of the electric motor 42a, of the transmission or gear unit 40b, which is designed for preference as a planetary gear unit, as well as of the supplementary housing 66, which serves as to accommodate the power take-off toothed wheels or gear wheels on the output side of the planetary gear arrangement. The drive movement of the motor 42a is transferred as follows: The rotational movement of the shaft 42a1 of the motor 42a is transferred to a toothed wheel or gear wheel 42a", on which a toothed belt 45' runs. The toothed belt 45' further encompasses a toothed wheel or gear wheel 42b' of the transmission or gear unit 42b on the intake side. This intake-side toothed wheel or gear wheel 42b' is located on the same shaft as the sun gear of the planetary gear arrangement, while the planetary gear wheels, in engagement with the sun gear in the middle of the transmission or gear unit 42b, are connected in a torsionally-resistant manner with an output-side toothed wheel or gear wheel 42b' at the transmission or gear unit 42b. The toothed wheel or gear wheel 42b' meshes with an intermediate wheel 46c,<br><br>
which is located on an axle 46c1 in the additional housing 66. The intermediate wheel 46c in turn meshes with a toothed wheel or gearwheel 47 on a shaft 47' in the intermediate housing 66, whereby at the other end of the shaft 47' a power take-off-side toothed wheel or gear wheel 46b is in engagement with a toothed wheel or gear wheel 22a' on the roller 22a or on a roller section respectively.<br>
As a departure from this, in Fig. 1h a toothed belt drive 45 is arranged between the shaft 47' in the supplementary housing 66 and the roller 22a of the drafting device 20, whereby, as already mentioned, this is a delivery roller of the drafting device 20. As is also indicated by the double arrow at 43b and the pivoting arrow above it respectively, the further holding element 43b can be adjusted in the longitudinal direction, like the holding element 43a, and pivoted transversely to it, and is secured by screw connections at the circumference of the drive 40.<br>
Represented between the motor 42a and the transmission or gear unit 42b is a fluid housing 62, for accommodating a fluid, for example, for example the oil for the transmission system, whereby a fluid line 64 runs through the fluid housing 62. A coolant fluid flows in the fluid line 64, which conducts waste heat away from the transmission or gear unit 42b and motor 42a respectively. The fluid line is laid over the length of the machine and can be connected in series to several drives 40.<br>
In Fig. 1g the housing of the drive 40 is designated by 60. This housing can be designed in such a way that a motor unit 42a and a transmission or gear unit 42b can be connected to it, as well as holding elements 42c and further holding elements 43a and 43b, as well as a supplementary housing 66. As mentioned, in a double-sided spinning machine, such as with roller arrangements of drafting devices according to Fig. 1d, at least six drives are present, in each case for two feed rollers 22a according to Fig. 1d, as well as middle rollers between the feed roller and the delivery roller in the outer area of the spinning machine 10.<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows in diagrammatic form a plan view of a spinning machine, consisting of several sections, whereby a section is in each case delimited by a plate 12. In the arrangement in Fig. 3 a total of eight drives are represented, whereby four drives 40 serve to drive the middle roller, and the two drives 40 located to the left of the middle of the machine are provided for the drive of the inner roller, i.e. the feed roller, and the two drives located to the right of the middle of the machine are connected to the outer rollers 22a. With a very long machine, it may be necessary for individual roller lines, such as the uppermost 22a in Fig. 3, to be allocated more than one drive 40. The individual spinning positions of the spinning machine are represented by adjacent circles in the right-hand part of the figure next to the machine head 74, this machine head being able to contain, for example, the control unit for the drive for the machine spindles. The left end of the machine does not require any further housing, but is formed by the end of the first section on the left side.<br>
Fig. 4 again shows a diagrammatic overview drawing of the drafting device drives of a double-sided spinning machine. On both sides of the sections 70 are spinning positions 11, to which the fibre material is conducted via the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, 522c. For the present case, it is assumed that four drafting device drive blocks of the same type, 540a, 540b, 540a*, 540b1, are located in each case at the ends of the drafting rollers. Further transmission or gear blocks 540c can be located between the ends of the drafting rollers, of which in each case only one single block is indicated on each machine side. Provided in the drive block 540a is a first upper electric motor 42a for the drive of the feed roller 522a and the middle roller 522b. The drive power is transferred via an intermediate transmission or gear unit 45a, in particular toothed wheel or gear wheel transmission arrangements, onto an intermediate transmission or gear unit 42b. From this, two further intermediate transmission or gear units 45b and 45c branch off; coupled to the first is a transmission or gear unit 41b, which drives the middle roller; a further transmission or gear unit 42b, for driving the feed roller 522a, is connected to the intermediate transmission or gear unit 42b. The delivery roller 522c has its own drive with a motor 42a, an intermediate transmission 45d, and a reduction gear 42b". A toothed belt drive can be provided in each case between an end transmission or gear unit 42b" and the drafting roller 522c allocated<br><br>
to it, to serve, as mentioned, for damping vibrations in addition to changing the revolution speed. The latter motor 42a can also be coupled directly to the transmission or gear unit 42b", without an intermediate transmission or gear unit 45d and a further shaft 41c. The interior of the drive block 540b can be structured as a mirror image to the arrangement of the elements in the drive block 540at and also in the drive block 540b1. The arrangement of the elements in the drive block 540a1 corresponds essentially to that in the drive block 540a, mirrored at the longitudinal axis of the spinning machine 1. The additional drive blocks 540c between the ends of the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, are simpler in design, since these serve only to drive the most heavily burdened middle roller 522b. A motor 42a, in particular a synchronous motor, is, as also described for the transmission or gear block 540a, connected via an intermediate transmission or gear unit 45 to a reduction gear 42b. As mentioned, this can be a sun gear system, planetary gear system, or synchro-drive gear system. This in turn is connected via a further intermediate drive 45e to the middle roller 522b, whereby in this situation, in the simplest case, a pair of toothed wheels or gear wheels come into question, or, for the damping of transmission vibrations, a toothed belt transmission system, as described in connection with Fig. 1d. With very long machines, it may be to the purpose for several transmission or gear blocks 540c to be arranged between the ends of the drafting rollers, whereby these can also be allocated to the delivery roller 522c.<br>
The other reference numbers not mentioned from the representation in Fig. 4 correspond to those reproduced in Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 4a shows in greater detail a preferred embodiment of a transmission concept according to Fig. 4 for a row of drafting rollers 522a, b, c. The reference numbers used in Fig. 4 apply to the identical elements of the transmission or gear units, as well as to their descriptions. The intermediate transmission or gear units, e.g. 45, 45a, 45b, are for preference toothed belt transmission systems; the toothed wheels or gearwheels of the motor shafts or transmission shafts, the latter being represented in each case as horizontal broken lines, are indicated by dotted vertical lines. The middle transmission or<br><br>
gear block serves to provide the additional drive for the middle roller 522b; the blocks 540a and 540b are designed to be mirror images of one another.<br>
Represented in diagrammatic form in Fig. 5 are two transmission or gear blocks for driving two drafting rollers 522b of a double-sided machine. The rollers 522b can be the middle roller or also the delivery roller of a drafting device. The transmission or gear block can be placed at the end of a roller 522b or even at any desired position between the spinning positions 11 of the spinning machine 1, whereby the individual elements such as motors 42a, first transmission or gear units 42b, part transmission or gear units 42b', and end transmission or gear units 42b" are secured to a carrier element 26 of the frame of the spinning machine. The double arrows in Fig. 5 are intended to indicate, in addition to the individual elements such as transmission or gear units 42b, that the elements are arranged so as to be capable of displacement in relation to the carrier element 26. It is also possible, for example, for an element, the transmission or gear unit 42b, and further elements, the intermediate transmission or gear units 42b1 or the output transmission elements 42b", to be secured next to one another in such a way that a rotation about a common axis is possible, such as the shaft 41b in Fig. 5. This makes it possible for several elements of the same type to be used in the spinning machine for different rollers, in other words, for example, the middle roller 522b or the delivery roller 522c according to Fig. 4, in that, thanks to the displacement capability or pivoting capability of individual elements in relation to one another, the output transmission or gear units 42b can be coupled directly to a drafting roller 522b without the intermediate engagement of a further transmission or gear unit, such as, for example, the intermediate transmission or gear units or the output transmission or gear units 45e of the transmission or gear block 540c in Fig. 4. Specifically, a motor 42a of the transmission or gear block 540c according to Fig. 5 is connected, via an intermediate transmission or gear unit, to a toothed belt drive 45 with a first shaft 41a, which serves as an input shaft of the transmission or gear unit 42b. The rotational movement of this transmission or gear unit is transferred by means of the shaft 41b on to the intermediate transmission or gear unit or part transmission or gear unit 42b'. A further shaft 41c can transfer power to the output transmission or gear unit 42b". Instead of this shaft 41 c, an intermediate transmission or gear unit 45b can also be arranged as a<br><br>
substitute, such as between the transmission or gear units 42b and 41b of the transmission or gear block 540a in Fig. 4. In all situation in which the drawings are not comjiletaji should he assumedJhaf elements with the same effect ofthe two transmission^, or gear blocks 540c in Fig. 5 are arranged mirror-symmetrical to a vertical plane E, which is the vertical mid-plane through the spinning machine 1 according to Fig.4. In connection with the description of Figs. 4 and 5, reference may be made, for example, to the disclosure in the German Patent Application DE 100 40 420, with general explanations regarding the design structure of a spinning machine and, in particular, of the drive possibilities of a drafting device as well as the design structure of a drafting device.<br>
It is understood that several drive motors which serve to drive one and the same drafting roller, such as the motors 42a in the transmission or gear block 540a and the motor 42a of the transmission or gear block 540c, which jointly drive the drafting roller 522b, must be controlled synchronously. This also applies if the drafting roller 522b is subdivided into several sections. If, for example, the motors 42a of the said transmission or gear blocks are connected to a common control unit or to one and the same frequency converter for power supply, then the overall transmission ratio between the motor 42a and the transmission or gear unit 41b on the one hand in the transmission or gear block 540a, and the electric motor 42a and the end transmission or gear unit 45e of the transmission or gear block 540c on the other, must be of equal value.<br>
In the diagrammatic representation of the drive concept for the drafting roller according to Fig. 6, analogous reference numbers have been selected as in Fig. 4. The rollers 522a, 522b, and 522c are, in accordance with Fig. 4, the feed roller, the middle roller, and the discharge roller of the drafting device 20. In the transmission or gear blocks 540a and 540b and 540c, 540a\ etc. respectively, the aggregations of the elements such as motors 42a, transmission or gear units 42b, are indicated overall by rectangles, identified by EZ, MZ, AZ. This indicates that the aggregations EZ, MZ. AZ serve in each case to drive the feed rollers or the middle roller or the delivery roller respectively, corresponding to the reference numbers 522a, 522b, 522c. It is advantageous that the part transmission or gear unit EZ, as indicated in Fig. 6, is to be coupled to the part transmission or gear unit MZ, as<br><br>
determined in Fig. 4 and the description pertaining to this, by means of an intermediate transmission or gear unit 42b. From Fig. 6 it can be seen that for a longer spinning machine, with, for example, more than 1,000 spinning positions, a total of six transmission or gear blocks are allocated in each case with the aggregations EZ, MZ, AZ. The lengths of the roller sections in proportion to the overall length of a roller strand are indicated in Figs. 6 to 11 in each case by a fraction of a number, 1/4 or 2/3, whereby these proportion figures are selected only by way of example. In Fig. 6 the first transmission or gear block 540a is connected to the first transmission or gear block 540a at roller sections 522a, b, etc., whereby these roller sections extend only over 1/3 of the total length. Likewise, the middle transmission or gear block 540c and the transmission or gear block at the other end of the spinning machine 540b are also allocated to roller sections which in each case extend over 1/3 of the total length.<br>
In Fig. 7 an arrangement is shown which differs in the following respect: The transmission or gear block 540a or 540a1 respectively serve only the roller sections 522a etc., which extend over 1/4 of the total length of the roller strands, while the middle transmission or gear block 540c on both sides in each case drives roller sections towards the end of the machine, which likewise extend over about 1/4 of the total length. It would therefore be to the purpose to assign roller sections to the drive blocks 540a, 540b, 540c in each case, which in each case run over 1/3 of the total length of a roller strand.<br>
Fig. 8 represents a combination of roller blocks 540a, 540b, 540c, which could, for example, be realised by the elements of the corresponding transmission or gear blocks according to Fig. 4. The transmission or gear block 540a in Fig. 8 can likewise be designed like the transmission or gear block 540a in Fig. 4, with the difference that the transmission elements for driving the middle roller 522b or MZ respectively are missing. Instead of them, an additional transmission or gear block 540c can be arranged which has the structure which has been described in connection with Fig. 4 for the transmission or gear block 540c. With the fractions 1/3 or 2/3 respectively with the roller sections, it is again indicated, byway of example, what proportion the lengths of the individual roller sections have in relation to the overall length of a roller strand.<br><br>
According to Fig. 9, there are in total six aggregations of transmission elements MZ present, while for the drive of the feed roller or the delivery roller respectively only four aggregations of EZ or AZ of transmission elements respectively are provided. The individual aggregations of transmission elements EZ, MZ, AZ can be grouped together in transmission or gear blocks 540a, 540c, 540a' etc. In the middle of the machine, the transmission or gear block 540c and 540c' respectively comprise in each case only those transmission components which are necessary for the drive of the middle roller which is subjected to the greatest load. These correspond, for example, to those which are indicated in the present Description in connection with the figure description of Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a simplified arrangement, whereby only two transmission or gear blocks 540a, 540a' are present, comprising in each case the aggregations EZ, MZ, AZ. The blocks are arranged in the middle of the machine, with the result that half of a roller strand is arranged on both sides of the blocks in each case.<br>
With a machine which is longer than a machine according to Fig. 10, it is to the purpose for the number of transmission or gear blocks to be doubled in relation to the embodiment in Fig. 10. This is represented in Fig. 11. Located in each case in the middle of a machine half are transmission or gear blocks 540a, 540a', etc., with roller sections coupled on both sides which in each case extend over 1/4 of the total length of the spinning machine. The roller sections can be connected separately or continuously. The transmission or gear blocks can be designed as described in connection with Fig. 4, in particular with regard to the transmission or gear block 540a according to Fig. 4 or Fig. 4a.<br>
Preference is given, according to Figs. 10,11, to a double-sided spinning machine with spinning positions 11 arranged on both sides of sections 70, with a drafting device 20 with several rollers 22, whereby fibre material is conducted to the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, 522c, designed in such a way that located on each machine side is at least one drafting device drive block 540a, 540b, 540a1, 540b', 540c, 540c', with its own drive motor 42a, in each case between the ends of the drafting roller, or that several such drafting device drive blocks are present, in part of the same type, whereby these blocks can be combined at<br><br>
will, in accordance with the foregoing description, as represented in the Figures by the reference numbers 540a, 540a', 540b\ 540c, 540c'.<br><br>
