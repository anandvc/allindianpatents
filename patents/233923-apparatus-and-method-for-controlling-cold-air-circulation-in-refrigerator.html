				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING COLD AIR<br>
CIRCULATION IN REFRIGERATOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to an<br>
apparatus for controlling cold air circulation in a refrigerator, which allows the internal<br>
temperature throughout a refrigerating chamber of the refrigerator to be uniformly<br>
distributed.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
FIG. 6 shows a sectional view of a refrigerator which employs a conventional<br>
apparatus for controlling cold air circulation therein. As shown in this figure, a freezing<br>
chamber 3 and a refrigerating chamber 5, which are storage spaces formed in the interior<br>
of a main body 1 of the refrigerator, are separated from each, other by a barrier 4. A<br>
plurality of shelves 5' are installed at different levels in the refrigerating chamber 5 so that<br>
stored goods can be put on the shelves. A vegetable storage chamber 6 for separately<br>
storing fruits or vegetables therein is formed at a lowermost portion of the refrigerating<br>
chamber 5. In general, the vegetable storage chamber 6 is constructed in the form of a<br>
drawer.<br>
The freezing chamber 3 and the refrigerating chamber 5 are opened and closed by<br>
doors 7, 7', respectively, so as to communicate with the exterior thereof. Inner surfaces<br>
of the doors 7, T are provided with door baskets 8 for accommodating stored goods.<br>
Meanwhile, an evaporator 9, which is one of constituent components of a heat<br>
exchange cycle for generating cold air to circulate in the refrigerator, is installed in the<br>
rear of the freezing chamber 3. A space in which the evaporator 9 is installed is shielded<br>
by a shroud 10. A grill fan 12 is mounted between the shroud 10 and the freezing<br>
chamber 3. Further, in order to circulate the cold air generated by the evaporator 9, a<br>
blower fan 14 is installed above the evaporator 9. The blower fan 14 causes the cold air<br>
to flow into a space between the shroud 10 and the grill fan 12. The grill fan 12 is also<br>
provided with a discharge port (not shown) through which the cold air is discharged to<br>
the freezing chamber 3.<br>
Moreover, the cold air which has flowed downward through between the shroud<br>
10 and the grill fan 12 is supplied to the refrigerating chamber 5 through the barrier 4.<br>
To this end, a refrigerating chamber duct 16 is installed in the rear of the refrigerating<br>
chamber 5 such that it extends lengthily from an upper end of the refrigerating chamber to<br>
a lower end thereof. The refrigerating chamber duct 16 is formed with cold air discharge<br>
ports 17 through which the cold air is discharged to spaces partitioned by the shelves 5'.<br>
Then, a freezing chamber return flow passage 18 is formed such that the freezing<br>
chamber 3 communicates with the space with the evaporator 9 installed therein through a<br>
top surface of the barrier 4 corresponding to a floor of the freezing chamber 3. The cold<br>
air which has circulated in the freezing chamber 3 is returned to the evaporator 9 through<br>
the-freezing chamber return flow passage 18. Further, a refrigerating chamber return<br>
flow passage 19 is formed such that the refrigerating chamber S communicates with the<br>
space with the evaporator 9 installed therein through a bottom surface of the barrier 4<br>
corresponding to a ceiling of the refrigerating chamber-5.<br>
However; there are-the following problems in the conventional apparatus for<br>
controlling the cold air circulation constructed as such.<br>
In the prior art, as a refrigeration cycle is operated and the blower fan 14 is also<br>
driven, the cold air which has circulated in the refrigerating chamber 5 is delivered<br>
through the refrigerating chamber return flow passage 19 to the evaporator 9 where heat<br>
exchange occurs, and then circulates in the refrigerator. Therefore, during the driving of<br>
the refrigeration cycle, the temperature of the refrigerating chamber 5 is relatively lowered<br>
since a great deal of cold air is delivered to the refrigerating chamber 5. On the contrary,<br>
when the refrigeration cycle is stopped, the temperature of the refrigerating chamber 5 is<br>
rapidly increased in a state where there is no cold air flow. In such a way, if the cold air<br>
flow varies depending on the turning-on/off of the refrigeration cycle, the temperature<br>
deviation in the refrigerating chamber 5 becomes larger. Consequently, freshness of the<br>
stored goods is deteriorated.<br>
Particularly, the cold air supplied to the refrigerating chamber 5 through the<br>
refrigerating chamber duct 16 is relatively less influenced by the blower fan 14. Further,<br>
the cold air is relatively less delivered to the door baskets 8 spaced far apart from the<br>
discharge port 17. Thus, the temperatures of the door baskets 8 are relatively higher<br>
than those in the shelves 5' located at the same levels as the baskets 8. Such a<br>
phenomenon becomes severest at a position corresponding to the position of the vegetable<br>
storage chamber 6, which is a position of the lowermost one of the door baskets 8.<br>
Moreover, an actual temperature of the vegetable storage chamber 6 is relatively<br>
higher than an optimum temperature therein. This is because there is a relatively little<br>
amount of cold air which flows toward a lower portion of the refrigerating chamber duct<br>
16 and is then delivered to the vegetable storage chamber 6. That is, according to the<br>
prior art, the cold air is not uniformly delivered to the entire refrigerating chamber 5,<br>
Thus, it is likely that the temperature of a lower portion of the refrigerating chamber 5<br>
becomes, relatively higher, whereas the temperature of an upper portion of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 5 becomes relatively lower.<br>
Thus, there are disadvantages as described below. Since the temperature of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 5 is not uniformly set in such a way, the freshness of foodstuffs<br>
stored in the. lower portion of the refrigerating chamber 5 is deteriorated. In addition<br>
since the cold air in the upperportion of the refrigerating chamber 5 is returned to the*<br>
evaporator 9 in a state wherethe cold air is at a relatively lower temperature, heat loss<br>
occurs in the evaporator 9.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention is conceived to solve the aforementioned<br>
problems in the prior art. An object of the present invention is to minimize temperature<br>
deviation in a refrigerating chamber of a refrigerator.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to precisely maintain the temperature of<br>
a vegetable storage chamber installed at a lower portion of the refrigerating chamber of<br>
the refrigerator.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to minimize heat loss of cold air which<br>
is returned from the refrigerating chamber to an evaporator.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention for achieving the above objects,<br>
there is provided an apparatus for controlling cold air circulation in a refrigerator,<br>
comprising a cold air supply means for supplying cold air, which has been generated by a<br>
heat exchanger, to a storage space by using a blower fan; a cold air supply flow passage<br>
with a plurality of cold air discharge ports corresponding to respective portions of the<br>
storage space so that the cold air supplied from the cold air supply means is delivered to<br>
the storage space; a cold air return flow passage for returning the cold air, which has<br>
circulated in the storage space, to the heat exchanger by means, of suction force of the<br>
blower fan; a cold air circulation means for causing the cold air, which has been supplied<br>
from the cold air supply flow passage to the storage space, to flow from a lower portion<br>
of the storage space to a relatively upper portion thereof; and a microcomputer for<br>
controlling the cold air supply means and the cold air circulation means based on<br>
information on temperature of the storage space so as to circulate the cold air in the<br>
refrigerator.<br>
The cold air circulation means preferably comprises a circulation fan for sucking<br>
the cold air at the lower portion of the storage space, and a circulation duct of which an<br>
inlet is disposed at the lower portion of the storage space and an outlet is disposed at the<br>
relatively upper portion of the storage space so as to deliver the cold air sucked by the<br>
circulation fan into the storage space again.<br>
The circulation fan may be installed at the outlet or inlet of the circulation duct.<br>
The cold air circulation means may be installed within the cold air supply flow<br>
passage, or at a side wall of the storage space which is separate from the cold air supply<br>
flow passage.<br>
The outlet of the circulation duct is preferably installed at the cold air discharge<br>
port of the cold air supply flow passage, and the inlet of the circulation duct is preferably<br>
positioned at a relatively lower portion of the storage space.<br>
The inlet of the circulation duct is preferably configured to communicate with a<br>
lower portion of an auxiliary storage chamber which is separately formed at the lower<br>
portion of the storage space.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
for controlling cold air circulation in a refrigerator including a blower fan for circulating<br>
cold air, which has been generated by a heat exchanger, in a storage space and a<br>
circulation fan for circulating the cold air from a relatively lower portion of the storage<br>
space to a relatively upper portion thereof, comprising the steps of determining, by a<br>
microcomputer, driving of the blower fan and the circulation fan through comparison of a<br>
sensed temperature of the storage space with a predetermined temperature; driving the<br>
blower fan based on the determination, of the microcomputer and delivering the cold air,<br>
which has been generated by the heat exchanger, into the storage space; and stopping the<br>
blower fan based on the determination of the microcomputer and circulating the cold air,<br>
which has been delivered into the storage space, from the lower portion to the upper<br>
portion of the storage space by using the circulation fan.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of an apparatus and method for controlling<br>
cold air circulation in a refrigerator according to the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
First, referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, one embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described. As shown in these figures, the interior of a main body 30 of a refrigerator,<br>
which is comprised of walls having insulation layers, is provided with a freezing chamber<br>
33 and a refrigerating chamber 35 as storage spaces. The freezing chamber 33 and the<br>
refrigerating chamber 35 are separated by a barrier 34 so that the freezing chamber 33 and<br>
the refrigerating chamber 35 are disposed at upper and lower portions of the main body,<br>
respectively.<br>
A plurality of shelves 35' are installed in the refrigerating chamber 35 so that<br>
stored goods can be put. thereon. A vegetable storage chamber 36 as an auxiliary storage<br>
space, which is separately formed by means of partitions so as to store fruits or vegetables,<br>
is installed at a lower portion within the refrigerating chamber 35.<br>
The freezing chamber 33 and the refrigerating chamber 35 selectively<br>
communicate with the outside environment of the refrigerator by doors 37, 37',<br>
respectively. . Inner surfaces of the doors 37, 37' are provided with a plurality of dQfir<br>
baskets 38 for accommodating stored goods.<br>
Meanwhile, an-evaporator 39 as a heat exchanger, which constitutes a<br>
refrigeration cycle, is installed in the rear of the freezing chamber 33 in order to generate<br>
cold air to circulate in the refrigerator. A space between the evaporator 39 and the<br>
freezing chamber 33 is partitioned by a shroud 40 and a grill fan 42. A space between<br>
the shroud 40 and the grill fan 42 serves to distribute the cold air to the freezing chamber<br>
33 and the refrigerating chamber 35. Here, the grill fan 42 is formed with a plurality of<br>
discharge ports (not shown) through which the cold air is supplied to the freezing<br>
chamber 33. Further, a blower fan 44 which provides driving force for causing the cold<br>
air to flow in the refrigerator is installed above the evaporator 39.<br>
In order to supply the cold air into the refrigerating chamber 35, a refrigerating<br>
chamber duct 46 is installed in the rear of the refrigerating chamber 35. The refrigerating<br>
chamber duct 46 extends lengthily from an upper end of the refrigerating chamber to a<br>
lower end thereof, and is formed with cold air discharge ports 47 to correspond to the<br>
respective shelves 35. The cold air is delivered as far as the vegetable storage chamber<br>
36 through the refrigerating chamber duct 46.<br>
In order to return the cold air, which has circulated in the freezing chamber 33, to<br>
the evaporator 39, a freezing chamber return flow passage 48 is formed through the<br>
interior of the barrier 34. Furthermore, in order to return the cold air, which has<br>
circulated in the refrigerating chamber 35, to the evaporator 39, a refrigerating chamber<br>
return flow passage 49 is formed through the interior of the barrier 34. An inlet of the<br>
refrigerating chamber return flow passage 49 is formed on a bottom surface of the barrier<br>
34 which becomes a ceiling of the refrigerating chamber 35.<br>
Meanwhile, a circulation duct 50 is provided for further facilitating the cold air<br>
circulation in the lower portion of the refrigerating chamber 35. Although the circulation<br>
duct 50 is installed in the refrigerating chamber duct 46 in this embodiment, it is not<br>
necessarily limited thereto. The circulation duct 50 may be installed at a location, such<br>
as both side walls of the refrigerating chamber 35, separate from the .refrigerating chamber<br>
duct 46.<br>
An inlet 51 of the circulation duct 50 is disposed at a rearward lower end of the<br>
vegetable storage chamber 36 to communicate with a lower portion of the vegetable<br>
storage chamber 36. An outlet-52 of the circulation duct 50 is disposed to be open to<br>
above a shelf 35 which is placed at a top end of the vegetable storage chamber 3 6. At<br>
this time; the outlet 52 is installed to penetrate through a portion of a front surface of the<br>
refrigerating chamber duct 46. The outlet 52 is also formed to communicate with the<br>
refrigerating chamber 35 via the cold air discharge port 47.<br>
Further, the outlet 52 of the circulation duct 50 is provided with a circulation fan<br>
54 for circulating the cold air through the circulation duct 50. The circulation fan 54<br>
causes the cold air, which has been sucked through the inlet 51, to be discharged into the<br>
refrigerating chamber 35 through the outlet 52.<br>
In the meantime, it is preferred that temperature sensors (not shown) be mounted<br>
so as to sense the temperatures within the refrigerating chamber 35, the vegetable storage<br>
chamber 36 and the like. Information on the temperature sensed by the temperature<br>
sensors are transmitted to a microcomputer (not shown) and then used for determination<br>
of the driving of the refrigeration cycle (i.e., driving of the blower fan 44) and the driving<br>
of the circulation fan 54. The microcomputer determines the driving of the blower fan<br>
44 and the circulation fan 54 based on predetermined data and the information on the<br>
temperature sensed by the temperature sensors.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the present embodiment having the aforementioned<br>
constitution will be described.<br>
First of all, the cold air circulation performed in the refrigerator will be explained<br>
When the refrigeration cycle is operated, a compressor (not shown) is driven and a<br>
refrigerant moves along the refrigeration cycle. Then, a relatively low temperature<br>
refrigerant is supplied to the evaporator 39 to generate the cold air.<br>
The cold air generated by the evaporator 39 circulates in the refrigerator by<br>
means of the blower fan 44. That is, the cold air is delivered to the space between the<br>
shroud 40 and the grill fan 42 by the driving of the blower fan 44, and then, a portion of<br>
the cold air is delivered to the freezing chamber 33 through the discharge ports of the grill<br>
fan 42. The remainder of the cold air flows downward in the space between the shroud<br>
40 and the grill fan 42, passes through the barrier 34 and is supplied to the refrigerating<br>
chamber duct 46.<br>
The cold air delivered to the refrigerating, chamber duct. 46 flows downward<br>
along the refrigerating chamber duct 46 and is simultaneously discharged through the<br>
respective discharge ports 47 to above the respective shelves 35' in the refrigerating<br>
chamber 35. The discharged cold air cools the stored goods within the refrigerating<br>
chamber 35.<br>
Then, the cold air which has been delivered to the freezing chamber 33 and the<br>
refrigerating chamber 35 is returned to the evaporator 39 through the freezing chamber<br>
return flow passage 48 and the refrigerating chamber return flow passage 49, respectively.<br>
Heat exchange occurs between the cold air and the refrigerant in the evaporator, and the<br>
cold air then repeatedly circulates in the refrigerator.<br>
Meanwhile, the circulation fan 54 sucks the cold air on a side of the lower portion<br>
of the refrigerating chamber 35 and discharges it upward. It is preferred that the<br>
circulation fan 54 be driven when the blower fan 44 is not operated. This is to prevent<br>
the vegetable storage chamber 36 from being cooled too excessively due to continuous<br>
supply of the cold air, which is supplied from the evaporator 39 by the operation of the<br>
blower fan 44, to around the vegetable storage chamber 36.<br>
Once the temperature of the refrigerating chamber 35 reaches a predetermined<br>
temperature, the operation of the heat exchange cycle is stopped and the operation of the<br>
blower fan 44 is also stopped. It is preferable to operate the circulation fan 54 in this<br>
condition.<br>
Namely, when the circulation fan 54 is operated, the cold air at the rearward<br>
lower end of the vegetable storage chamber 36 is sucked through the inlet 51 of the<br>
circulation duct 50. Then, the sucked cold air is discharged to above the shelf 35' placed<br>
at the top end of the vegetable storage chamber 36 through the outlet 52 of the circulation<br>
duct 50. With such circulation, a space between a leading end of the vegetable storage<br>
chamber 36 and the door 37' is supplied with thecold air from the upper portion of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 35. Here, the cold air delivered from the upper, portion of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 35 passes through around the vegetable storage chamber 36 and is<br>
sucked into the inlet 51 of the circulation duct 50. This cold air, circulation is indicated<br>
by arrows in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
In such a way, the relatively low temperature cold air can be delivered particularly<br>
to around the vegetable storage chamber 36 as well as the door baskets 38' of the door<br>
37'. Further, the relatively low temperature cold air can also be delivered to a<br>
lowermost door, basket 38' of the door 37' which otherwise might have a highest<br>
temperature. Thus, the lowermost basket 38' can be set at a desired temperature.<br>
Such an operation of the circulation fan 54 can be controlled based on sensed<br>
signals detected by a temperature sensor additionally installed in the vegetable storage<br>
chamber 36. That is, when the temperature of the vegetable storage chamber 36 reaches<br>
a predetermined temperature, the circulation fan 54 is stopped in response to the sensed<br>
signals detected by the temperature sensor.<br>
Next, another embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
When describing the constitution of this embodiment, only elements different from those<br>
of the previous embodiment shown in FIG. 1 will be described and like or similar elements<br>
are denoted by the same reference numerals as FIG. 1<br>
In order to further facilitate the cold air circulation in the refrigerating chamber 35,<br>
the present embodiment employs a circulation duct 150. The circulation duct 150 of the<br>
present embodiment is not also necessarily installed in the refrigerating chamber duct 46<br>
and may be installed at a location, such as both the side walls of the refrigerating chamber<br>
35, separate from the refrigerating chamber duct 46.<br>
A circulation fan 152 is installed at an inlet 151 which is disposed at a lower end<br>
of the circulation duct 150. The inlet 151 of the circulation duct 150 is fitted into and<br>
installed at a circulation inlet 47' of the refrigerating chamber duct 46. Thus, the<br>
circulation fan 152 is positioned inside the circulation inlet 47' so that the cold air within<br>
the refrigerating chamber 35 can be sucked thereinto.<br>
The circulation duct 150 is installed in the refrigerating chamber duct 46 to<br>
extend lengthily in an up and down direction and is provided with respective outlets 154<br>
at locations corresponding to the discharge ports 47 formed in the refrigerating chamber<br>
duct 46. The outlets 154 are formed at the locations corresponding to the discharge<br>
ports 47 so that the cold air flowing through the circulation duct 150 can be supplied to<br>
the refrigerating chamber 35 through the discharge ports 47. At this time, it is preferable<br>
to make cross-sectional areas of the outlets 154 smaller than those of the discharge ports<br>
47. Further, although each outlet 154 can be installed to be fitted into a portion of each<br>
discharge port 47, it is not necessarily limited thereto. The outlets 154 may be arranged<br>
to be disposed in the vicinity of the discharge ports 47 in the same way as the illustrated<br>
embodiment.<br>
Hereinafter, the. operation of the present embodiment as constructed as such will<br>
be briefly described. The present embodiment is the same as the previous embodiment in<br>
that the cold air generated by the evaporator 39 is delivered to the freezing chamber 33<br>
and the refrigerating chamber 35 by means of the blower fan 44, and in that the cold air<br>
delivered to the freezing chamber 33 and the refrigerating chamber 35 is returned through<br>
the respective freezing chamber return flow passage 48 and refrigerating chamber return<br>
flow passage 49 to the evaporator 39 where the heat exchange occurs between the cold<br>
air and the refrigerant in the evaporator and then repeatedly circulates in the refrigerator.<br>
Meanwhile, the circulation fan 152 sucks the cold air on a side of the interior of<br>
the refrigerating chamber 35 and then discharges it to the other side. It is preferable to<br>
drive the circulation fan 152 when the blower fan 44 is not operated. Alternatively, the<br>
circulation fan 152 may be driven together with the blower fan 44 so that the relatively<br>
low temperature cold air cannot be returned to the evaporator 39.<br>
Once the temperature of the refrigerating chamber 35 reaches a predetermined<br>
temperature, the operation of the heat exchange cycle is stopped and the operation of the<br>
blower fan 44 is also stopped. It is preferable to operate the circulation fan 152 in this<br>
condition.<br>
That is, the temperatures in the vicinity of the lower portion and the vegetable<br>
storage chamber 36 of the refrigerating chamber 35 are generally higher than the<br>
predetermined temperature. This is because the lower portion and the vegetable storage<br>
chamber 36 of the refrigerating chamber 35 are portions corresponding to a distal end of<br>
the refrigerating chamber duct 46.<br>
Therefore, when the circulation fan 152 is operated, the cold air flow indicated by<br>
arrows in FIGS.-3 and 4 is generated within the refrigerating chamber 35. With such<br>
cold air flow, the entire interior of the refrigerating chamber 35 can be kept at a uniform<br>
temperature.<br>
In other words, when the circulation fan 152 is operated, the cold air at the lower<br>
portion of the refrigerating chamber 35 is sucked into the circulation duct 150 through the<br>
circulation inlet 47'. Then, the sucked cold air. is delivered to an upper portion of the<br>
circulation duct 150 and discharged to a relatively upper, portion of the refrigexating-<br>
chamber 35 through the respective outlets 154.<br>
In particular the cold air around the vegetable storage chamber 36 is sucked into<br>
the circulation duct 150 by means of the driving of the. circulation fan 152 and the cold air<br>
at the upper portion of the refrigerating chamber 35 is simultaneously moved downward,<br>
so that the temperature of the entire refrigerating chamber 35 can be kept to be uniform.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, there is well shown that the temperature of the refrigerating<br>
chamber 35 according to the present invention is kept to be relatively uniform as time<br>
passes. The temperature of the compressor is plotted using a dotted line. The higher<br>
temperature of the compressor means that the refrigeration cycle is running. The<br>
temperature of the refrigerating chamber depending on the temperature of the compressor<br>
is plotted using a one-dotted chain line in case of the prior art and using a solid line in case<br>
of the present embodiment. As can be seen from this figure, in case of the present<br>
embodiment, the temperature deviation with the elapse of time is relatively small and thus<br>
the refrigerating chamber is kept at a substantially uniform temperature.<br>
With the apparatus and method for controlling the cold air circulation in the<br>
refrigerator according to the present invention which have been described in detail above,<br>
the temperature of the entire refrigerating chamber can be kept to be uniform, and<br>
particularly, the vegetable storage chamber disposed at the lowermost portion of the<br>
refrigerating chamber and the lowermost door basket of the door can be maintained at a<br>
desired temperature.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, since the temperature of the<br>
entire refrigerating chamber can be kept to be uniform, the relatively low temperature cold<br>
air is prevented from being delivered to and heat-exchanged with the evaporator. Thus,<br>
the efficiency of the refrigerator can be improved.<br>
Although the present invention has been described herein with respect to the<br>
preferred embodiments employed in an upright type refrigerator, it will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art that the present invention, can be employed in a parallel type<br>
refrigerator within the scope of the invention defined by the appended claims.<br>
