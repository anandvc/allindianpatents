ENTROPY CODING WITH COMPACT CODEBOOKS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the encoding/decoding of<br>
information values and in particular to entropy coding us-<br>
ing compact codebooks to generate an efficient code.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
In recent times, the multi-channel audio reproduction tech-<br>
nique is becoming more and more important. This may be due<br>
to the fact that audio compression/encoding techniques such<br>
as the well-known mp3 technique have made it possible to<br>
distribute audio records via the Internet or other trans-<br>
mission channels having a limited bandwidth. The mp3 coding<br>
technique has become so famous because of the fact that it<br>
allows distribution of all the records in a stereo format,<br>
i.e., a digital representation of the audio record includ-<br>
ing a first or left stereo channel and a second or right<br>
stereo channel.<br>
Nevertheless, there are basic shortcomings of conventional<br>
two-channel sound systems. Therefore, the surround tech-<br>
nique has been developed. A recommended multi-channel-<br>
surround representation includes, in addition to the two<br>
stereo channels L and R, an additional center channel C and<br>
two surround channels Ls, Rs. This reference sound format<br>
is also referred to as three/two-stereo, which means three<br>
front channels and two surround channels. Generally, five<br>
transmission channels are required. In a playback environ-<br>
ment, at least five speakers at five decent places are<br>
needed to get an optimum sweet spot in a certain distance<br>
of the five well-placed loudspeakers.<br>
Several techniques are known in the art for reducing the<br>
amount of data required for transmission of a multi-channel<br>
audio signal. Such techniques are called joint stereo tech-<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
niques. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 9, which<br>
shows a joint stereo device 60. This device can be a device<br>
implementing e.g. intensity stereo (IS) or binaural cue<br>
coding (BCC). Such a device generally receives - as an in-<br>
put - at least two channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) , and outputs<br>
at least a single carrier channel and parametric data. The<br>
parametric data are defined such that, in a decoder, an ap-<br>
proximation of an original channel (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) can be<br>
calculated.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients, time domain samples etc., which pro-<br>
vide a comparatively fine representation of the underlying<br>
signal, while the parametric data do not include such sam-<br>
ples . of spectral coefficients but include control parame-<br>
ters for controlling a certain reconstruction algorithm<br>
such as weighting by multiplication, time shifting, fre-<br>
quency shifting, phase shifting, etc. . The parametric<br>
data, therefore, include only a comparatively coarse repre-<br>
sentation of the signal or the associated channel. Stated<br>
in numbers, the amount of data required by a carrier chan-<br>
nel will be in the range of 60 - 70 kbit/s, while the<br>
amount of data required by parametric side information for<br>
one channel will typically be in the range of 1,5 - 2,5<br>
kbit/s. An example for parametric data are the well-known<br>
scale factors, intensity stereo information or binaural cue<br>
parameters as will be described below.<br>
The BCC Technique is for example described in the AES con-<br>
vention paper 5574, "Binaural Cue Coding applied to Stereo<br>
and Multi-Channel Audio Compression", C. Faller,<br>
F. Baumgarte, May 2002, Munich, in the IEEE WASPAA Paper<br>
"Efficient representation of spatial audio using perceptual<br>
parametrization", October 2001, Mohonk, NY, in "Binaural<br>
cue coding applied to audio compression with flexible ren-<br>
dering", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, AES 113th Convention,<br>
Los Angeles, Preprint 5686, October 2002 and in "Binaural<br>
cue coding - Part II: Schemes and applications", C. Faller<br><br>
— 3 —<br>
and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans, on Speech and Audio Proc.,<br>
volume level. 11, no. 6, Nov. 2003.<br>
In BCC encoding, a number of audio input channels are con-<br>
verted to a spectral representation using a DFT (Discrete<br>
Fourier Transform) based transform with overlapping win-<br>
dows. The resulting uniform spectrum is divided into non-<br>
overlapping partitions. Each partition approximately has a<br>
bandwidth proportional to the equivalent rectangular band-<br>
width (ERB). The BCC parameters are then estimated between<br>
two channels for each partition. These BCC parameters are<br>
normally given for each channel with respect to a reference<br>
channel and are furthermore quantized. The transmitted pa-<br>
rameters are finally calculated in accordance with pre-<br>
scribed formulas (encoded) , which may also depend on the<br>
specific partitions of the signal to be processed.<br>
A number of BCC parameters do exist. The ICLD parameter,<br>
for example, describes the difference (ratio) of the ener-<br>
gies contained in 2 compared channels. The ICC parameter<br>
(inter-channel coherence/correlation) describes the corre-<br>
lation between the two channels, which can be understood as<br>
the similarity of the waveforms of the two channels. The<br>
ICTD parameter (inter-channel time difference) describes a<br>
global time shift between the 2 channels whereas the IPD<br>
parameter (inter-channel phase difference) describes the<br>
same with respect to the phases of the signals.<br>
One should be aware that, in a frame-wise processing of an<br>
audio signal, the BCC analysis is also performed frame-<br>
wise, i.e. time-varying, and also frequency-wise. This<br>
means that, for each spectral band, the BCC parameters are<br>
individually obtained. This further means that, in case a<br>
audio filter bank decomposes the input signal into for ex-<br>
ample 32 band pass signals, a BCC analysis block obtains a<br>
set of BCC parameters for each of the 32 bands.<br><br>

A related technique, also known as parametric stereo, is<br>
described in J. Breebaart, S. van de Par, A. Kohlrausch, E.<br>
Schuijers, "High-Quality Parametric Spatial Audio Coding at<br>
Low Bitrates", AES 116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6072,<br>
May 2004, and E. Schuijers, J. Breebaart, H. Purnhagen, J.<br>
Engdegard, "Low Complexity Parametric Stereo Coding", AES<br>
116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6073, May 2004.<br>
Summarizing, recent approaches for parametric coding of<br>
multi-channel audio signals ("Spatial Audio Coding", "Bin-<br>
aural Cue Coding" (BCC) etc.) represent a multi-channel au-<br>
dio signal by means of a downmix signal (could be mono-<br>
phonic or comprise several channels) and parametric side<br>
information ("spatial cues") characterizing its perceived<br>
spatial sound stage. It is desirable to keep the rate of<br>
side information as low as possible in order to minimize<br>
overhead information and leave as much of the available<br>
transmission capacity for the coding of the downmix sig-<br>
nals .<br>
One way to keep the bit rate of the side information low is<br>
to losslessly encode the side information of a spatial au-<br>
dio scheme by applying, for example, entropy coding algo-<br>
rithms to the side information.<br>
Lossless coding has been extensively applied in general au-<br>
dio coding in order to ensure an optimally compact repre-<br>
sentation for quantized spectral coefficients and other<br>
side information. Examples for appropriate encoding schemes<br>
and methods are given within the ISO/IEC standards MPEG1<br>
part 3, MPEG2 part 7 and MPEG4 part 3.<br>
These standards and, for example also the IEEE paper<br>
"Noiseless Coding of Quantized Spectral Coefficients in<br>
MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding", S. R. Quackenbush, J. D.<br>
Johnston, IEEE WASPAA, Mohonk, NY, October 1997 describe<br>
state of the art techniques that include the following<br>
measures to losslessly encode quantized parameters:<br><br>
— 5 —<br>
•	Multi-dimensional Huffman Coding of quantized spectral<br>
coefficients<br>
•	Using a common (multi-dimensional) Huffman Codebook for<br>
sets of coefficients<br>
•	Coding the value either as a hole or coding sign infor-<br>
mation and magnitude information separately (i.e. have<br>
only Huffman codebook entries for a given absolute<br>
value which reduces the necessary codebook size,<br>
"signed" vs. "unsigned" codebooks)<br>
•	Using alternative codebooks of different largest abso-<br>
lute values (LAVs), i.e. different maximum absolute<br>
values within the parameters to be encoded<br>
•	Using alternative codebooks of different statistical<br>
distribution for each LAV<br>
•	Transmitting the choice of Huffman codebook as side in-<br>
formation to the decoder<br>
•	Using "sections" to define the range of application of<br>
each selected Huffman codebook<br>
•	Differential encoding of scalefactors over frequency<br>
and subsequent Huffman coding of the result<br>
Another technique for the lossless encoding of coarsely<br>
quantized values into a single PCM code is proposed within<br>
the MPEG1 audio standard (called grouping within the stan-<br>
dard and used for layer 2) . This is explained in more de-<br>
tail within the standard ISO/IEC 11172-3:93.<br>
The publication "Binaural cue coding - Part II: Schemes and<br>
applications", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans. on<br>
Speech and Audio Proc, volume level. 11, no. 6, Nov. 2003<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
gives some information on coding of BCC parameters. It is<br>
proposed, that quantized ICLD parameters are differentially<br>
encoded<br>
•	over frequency and the result is subsequently Huffman<br>
encoded (with a one-dimensional Huffman code)<br>
•	over time and the result is subsequently Huffman en-<br>
coded (with a one-dimensional Huffman code),<br>
and that finally, the more efficient variant is selected as<br>
the representation of an original audio signal.<br>
As mentioned above, it has been proposed to optimize com-<br>
pression performance by applying differential coding over<br>
frequency and, alternatively, over time and select the more<br>
efficient variant. The selected variant is then signaled to<br>
a decoder via some side information.<br>
The prior art techniques described above are useful to re-<br>
duce the amount of data that, for example, has to be trans-<br>
mitted during an audio- or videostream. Using the described<br>
techniques of lossless encoding based on entropy-coding<br>
schemes generally results in bit streams with a non-<br>
constant bit rate.<br>
In the AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) standard, a proposal is<br>
made to reduce both, the size of the code words and the<br>
size of the underlying codebook, by using "unsigned" code-<br>
books, assuming that the probability distribution of the<br>
information values to be encoded only depends on the magni-<br>
tudes of the values to be encoded rather than their signs.<br>
The sign bits are then transmitted separately and can be<br>
considered as a postfix code, mapping back the coded magni-<br>
tude information into the actual value (sign x magnitude).<br>
Assuming for example a four-dimensional Huffman codebook,<br>
this results in saving a factor of 2^4 = 16 (assuming that<br>
all values carry signs) in the size of the codebook.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
Quite some efforts have already been made to reduce code<br>
size by entropy coding. Nonetheless, one still fights some<br>
major disadvantages using techniques of prior art. For ex-<br>
ample, when using multi-dimensional Huffman codebooks, one<br>
can achieve a decrease in the bit rate needed to transmit<br>
some encoded information. This is achieved at the cost of<br>
an increase in the size of the Huffman codebook that has to<br>
be used, since for each additional dimension, the Huffman<br>
codebook size increases by a factor of two. This is espe-<br>
cially disadvantageous in applications where the Huffman<br>
codebook is transmitted together with the encoded informa-<br>
tion, as it is for example the case with some computer com-<br>
pression programs. Even if the Huffman codebook does not<br>
have to be transmitted with the data, it has to be stored<br>
in the encoder and in the decoder, needing expensive stor-<br>
age space, which is available only in limited quantities,<br>
especially in mobile applications for video or audio<br>
streaming or playback.<br>
Several publications relate to similar problems. For exam-<br>
ple, the US Patent 5550541 relates to the generation of<br>
compact source coding tables for encoder/decoder systems.<br>
Multi-dimensional Huffman encoding tables are generated<br>
which are smaller than conventional tables by ordering sym-<br>
bols within messages prior to encoding and additionally<br>
passing order information with the resulting code word.<br>

lattice code vectors. A combined approach combining Huffman<br>
coding and fixed length coding is suggested. The code vec-<br>

individual classes are encoded using entropy coding. As<br>

coding algorithm used in encoding quantized spectral compo-<br>
nents. N-tuples are encoded using different Huffman-code<br>
books, some of them having only absolute values to save on<br>
code book storage. In that case, a sign bit for each non-<br>
zero coefficient is appended to the code word.<br>

tor Quantizers", Patrick Raul and Christine Guillemont, re-<br>
lates to vector indexing algorithms valid for a large class<br>
of lattices used in audio-visual signal compression. The<br>
vectors are ordered in classes, wherein each class is de-<br>
fined as a possible "signed" permutation of the components<br>
of so-called "leader-vectors". Using unsigned leader-<br>
vectors requires the transmission of a sign bit for each<br>
non-zero element of a class-member.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a con-<br>
cept for generation and use of a more efficient code to<br>
compress information values and to reduce the size of an<br>
underlying codebook.<br><br>

According to a first aspect of the present invention, this<br>
object is achieved by an encoder for encoding information<br>
values, comprising: a grouper for grouping two or more in-<br>
formation values into a tuple in a tuple order; a code in-<br>
formation generator for generating order information indi-<br>
cating the tuple order and a code word for the tuple using<br>

same code word is assigned to tuples having identical in-<br>
formation values in different orders; and an output inter-<br>
face for outputting the code word and in association<br>
therewith the order information.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, this<br>
object is achieved by a decoder for decoding a code word<br>
based on information values, comprising: an input interface<br>
providing the code word and in association therewith an or-<br>
der information indicating a tuple order, being an order of<br>
two or more information values within a tuple of informa-<br>
tion values; a code processor for deriving a tuple using a<br>
decoding rule depending on an encoding rule used to create<br>
the code word, where the decoding rule is such that differ-<br>
ent tuples are derived from the same code word, the differ-<br>
ent tuples having the same information values in different<br>
tuple orders, as indicated by differing order information;<br>
and a degrouper for degrouping the tuples into two or more<br>
information values.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, this<br>
object is achieved by a method for encoding information<br>
values, the method comprising: grouping two or more infor-<br>
mation values into a tuple in a tuple order; generating or-<br>
der information indicating the tuple order; generating a<br>

encoding rule is such that the same code word is assigned<br>
to tuples having identical information values in different<br>
orders; and outputting the code word and in association<br>
therewith the order information.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, this<br>
object is achieved by a computer program implementing the<br>
above method, when running on a computer.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, this<br>
object is achieved by a method for decoding code words<br>
based on information values, the method comprising: provid-<br>
ing the code word and in association therewith an order in-<br>
formation indicating a tuple order, being an order of two<br>
or more information values within a tuple of information<br>
values; deriving a tuple using a decoding rule depending on<br>
an encoding rule used to create the code word, where the<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
decoding rule is such that different tuples are derived<br>
from the same code word, the different tuples having the<br>
same information values in different tuple orders, as indi-<br>
cated by differing order information; and degrouping the<br>
tuples into two or more information values.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, this<br>
object is achieved by a computer program implementing the<br>
above method, when running on a computer.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by encoded data based on informa-<br>
tion values, the encoded data comprising a code word for a<br>
tuple of two or more information values arranged in the tu-<br>
ple in a tuple order and an order information indicating<br>
the tuple order.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that an effi-<br>
cient code for encoding information values can be derived,<br>
when two or more information values are grouped in a tuple<br>
in a tuple order and when an encoding rule is used, that<br>
assigns the same code word to tuples having identical in-<br>
formation values in different orders and when an order in-<br>
formation, indicating the tuple order, is derived and asso-<br>
ciated to the code word.<br>
For entropy coding using Huffman codes, the inventive con-<br>
cept described above can be implemented more efficiently.<br>
The size of a Huffman codebook depends as well on the num-<br>
ber of possible values to be coded as on the number of<br>
jointly coded values (dimension of the Huffman codebook).<br>
In order to reduce the required storage space needed to<br>
represent a Huffman codebook in a specific application, it<br>
is advantageous to exploit symmetries in the probability<br>
distribution of the data to be coded such that one Huffman<br>
codeword represents a whole set of groups of jointly coded<br>
values with equal probability. The actual group of jointly<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
coded values is specified by a particular postfix code<br>
then.<br>
Since the order of two or more values in a tuple is not de-<br>
pendent on the content represented by the values, when the<br>
values are to a certain degree uncorrelated, equal prob-<br>
abilities for different orders of the same values can be<br>
assumed (since the values are uncorrelated). Particularly<br>
and preferably for a variable length code, i.e. a code hav-<br>
ing code words with different lengths, these equal prob-<br>
abilities will result in a smaller codebook and an effi-<br>
cient code, when the tuples with different orders of the<br>
same values are assigned to a single code word.<br>
Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion, the information values that are to be encoded by a<br>
two-dimensional Huffman encoder are differentially encoded<br>
first, resulting in a differential representation having<br>
certain symmetries as explained later in more detail. After<br>
that, a number of symmetry operations are applied to the<br>
differential representation, reducing the number of possi-<br>
ble tuples to be encoded, thus also reducing the size of<br>
the required codebook.<br>
Differentially encoding a distribution of values, occurring<br>
with a given probability distribution will result in a dis-<br>
tribution of difference values that is centered around<br>
zero, having a probability distribution that is symmetric,<br>
i.e. values of the same absolute value but with different<br>
signs will occur with the same probability.<br>
The basic principle of entropy coding, as for example Huff-<br>
man coding, is, that the used codebook represents a given<br>
probability distribution of information values as good as<br>
possible in view of assigning the shortest possible code<br>
words to the information values occurring at most. Multi-<br>
dimensional Huffman coding follows the same principle but<br>
combines two or more information values into a tuple,<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
wherein the whole tuple is then associated with a single<br>
codeword.<br>
Therefore, combining differential encoding with two-<br>
dimensional Huffman encoding yields two types of symme-<br>
tries, that can be made use of.<br>
The first symmetry derives from the observation that the<br>
probability of occurrence of the tuple (a, b) is approxi-<br>
mately the same as for the tuple (-a, -b). This corresponds<br>
to a point symmetry relative to the origin of a coordinate<br>
system, where the first value of a tuple defines the X-axis<br>
and the second value of a tuple defines the Y-axis.<br>
The second symmetry is based on the assumption, that chang-<br>
ing the order in which the two values in a tuple occur does<br>
not change the tuple's probability of occurrence, i.e. that<br>
(a, b) and (b, a) are equally probable. This corresponds to<br>
an axis symmetry relative to the bisectors of the coordi-<br>
nate systems first and third quadrant, when the coordinate<br>
system is defined as explained above.<br>
The two symmetries can be exploited such, that the size of<br>
a Huffman codebook is reduced by a factor of approximately<br>
4, meaning that symmetrical tuples are assigned the same<br>
codeword. The symmetry information, i.e. the order of the<br>
original tuple and the sign of the original tuple, are in-<br>
dicated by an order information and a sign information and<br>
transmitted together with the codeword to allow for decod-<br>
ing and a reconstruction of the original tuple including<br>
the sign and the order information.<br>
Recalling the above representation of the tuples within a<br>
two-dimensional coordinate system, both symmetries together<br>
can be understood as a 2-dimensional probability distribu-<br>
tion with level curves (curves of equal probabilities) re-<br>
sembling ovals with the principle axis rotated by 45 de-<br>
grees relative to the Cartesian coordinate system.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Making use of the two symmetries, only approximately one<br>
forth (1 quadrant) of the possible entries within the coor-<br>
dinate system has to be covered by Huffman codes. A two-bit<br>
postfix code determines a unique mapping between every pair<br>
of values in one of four quadrants and its corresponding<br>
pairs of values in the remaining three quadrants. Note that<br>
for pairs of values situated on either quadrant borderline,<br>
the postfix code consists of one bit only or can even be<br>
omitted in case of the pair of values situated on both bor-<br>
der lines, i.e. in the center of the distribution.<br>
The inventive concept will also reduce the size of the<br>
Huffman codebook for data that is not showing the symme-<br>
tries described above. If such data is encoded, on the one<br>
hand the size of the Huffman codebook will be small, but on<br>
the other hand the encoded representation might not be ide-<br>
ally compressed, since values occurring with different<br>
probabilities are represented by the same codeword, leading<br>
to a waste of bit rate since the Huffman codebook cannot be<br>
tuned to fit the data in an optimal way.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that the data is differentially<br>
encoded before applying symmetry treatments, since the dif-<br>
ferential encoding automatically yields advantageous symme-<br>
tries. Thus, the inventive concept can be used to assure a<br>
compact representation and a small Huffman codebook for<br>
every underlying set of information values, since the dis-<br>
advantage of doubling the number of possible information<br>
values by differentialy encoding the information values can<br>
be balanced by using the symmetries.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive encoder 100, the encoder 100 com-<br>
prising a grouper 102 and a code information generator 104,<br>
that includes an output interface.<br>
The information values 106 are grouped in tuples of infor-<br>
mation values 108a to 108c by the grouper. In the example<br>
shown in Fig. 1, the inventive concept is described by<br>
building tuples consisting of two information values each,<br>
i.e. by using a two-dimensional Huffman code.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
The tuples 108a to 108c are transferred to the code infor-<br>
mation generator 104, wherein the code information genera-<br>
tor implements an encoding rule that assigns the same code-<br>
word to tuples having identical information values in dif-<br>
ferent orders. Therefore, the tuples 108a and 108c are en-<br>
coded into the same code words 110a and 110b, whereas the<br>
tuple 108b is encoded into a different codeword 112. Ac-<br>
cording to the inventive concept, differing order informa-<br>
tion 114a and 114b is generated to preserve the information<br>
of the order in which the information values are grouped<br>
inside the tuples 108a and 108c. A combination of the order<br>
information and the codeword can therefore be used to re-<br>
construct the original tuples 108a and 108c, hence the or-<br>
der information is delivered in association with the code-<br>
word by the output interface. Generally, one may agree on<br>
different ordering schemes resulting in differing order in-<br>
formation bits. In the example shown in Fig. 1, the tuples<br>
are not reordered when the values within the tuples occur<br>
in ascending order, as it is the case for the tuples 108a<br>
and 108b. If one further agrees on assigning a order infor-<br>
mation of 0 to tuples that have not been reordered, one re-<br>
sults in the order information values as they have been as-<br>
signed to the codewords in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion, in which the code information generator 104 comprises<br>
an order encoder 120 and an entropy encoder 122 and wherein<br>
the encoder 100 further comprises an output interface 124.<br>
The order encoder 120 generates the order information 114a<br>
to 114c of the tuples (indicating the tuple order) and<br>
transfers the order information to the output inter-<br>
face 124. At the same time, the order encoder 120 reorders<br>
the information values within the tuples 108a to 108c to<br>
derive the tuples 126a to 126c changing the tuple order to<br>
a predefined tuple order, the predefined tuple order defin-<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
ing an encoding order of information values for groups of<br>
tuples having identical information values.<br>
The reordering can for example be done, also for tuples<br>
having more than two information values, by multiple subse-<br>
quent steps of exchanging the position of two information<br>
values within the tuple. After each step, it is checked,<br>
whether there exists an entry in the codebook of the order<br>
encoder for the given tuple order. If this is the case, the<br>
reordering can be stopped and the code word can be gener-<br>
ated. If not, the above procedure is repeated until the<br>
codeword is found. The order information can then, for ex-<br>
ample, be derived from the number of exchanges necessary to<br>
derive the codeword. Similarly, the correct tuple order<br>
could be rearranged using the order information on a de-<br>
coder side.<br>
The entropy coder encodes the tuples 126a to 126c to derive<br>
the code words 110a, 110b, and 112 and transfers these code<br>
words to the output interface 124.<br>
The output interface finally outputs the code words 110a,<br>
110b, and 112 and in association therewith the order infor-<br>
mation 114a to 114c.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, wherein the code information generator further<br>
comprises a sign encoder 130 for deriving a sign informa-<br>
tion indicating a sign combination of the information val-<br>
ues within the tuple.<br>
The inventive encoder shown in Fig. 3 makes also use of the<br>
second symmetry, assigning the same code words to tuples<br>
having information values of same absolute value and in the<br>
same order regarding their absolute values. Therefore, the<br>
sign encoder 130 derives a sign information 132a to 132c<br>
for each of the tuples 134a to 134c, indicating the sign of<br>
the values within the tuples. The sign encoder 130 simulta-<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
neously changes the signs of the information values within<br>
the tuples to derive a predefined sign combination, defin-<br>
ing an encoding sign combination for each order of absolute<br>
values within the tuple, i.e. for tuples differing only in<br>
the signs of the information values.<br>
The sign information 132a to 132c is additionally trans-<br>
ferred to the output interface 124 that also receives order<br>
information from the order encoder 120 and the code words<br>
from the entropy encoder 122. The output interface 124 then<br>
supplies the code words and in association therewith the<br>
order, information and the sign information.<br>
Fig. 4a shows, how the sign information can be derived by<br>
the sign encoder 130 and how the symmetry regarding the<br>
signs can be used to reduce the size of a required Huffman<br>
codebook.<br>
Shown are the possible values of a tuple (a, b) , graphi-<br>
cally represented by a matrix, wherein the values for a are<br>
shown on the X-axis and the values for b are shown on the<br>
Y-axis. The values for a and b are symmetrized around zero<br>
(for example by a previous differential encoding) and are<br>
ranging from -4 to 4 each.<br>
The matrix is showing all the 81 possible combinations of<br>
the parameter values a and b. Indicated is also a first<br>
axis 150, indicating the entries of the matrix, where the<br>
sum of a and b (a + b) equals zero. The figure further<br>
shows a second axis 152, where the difference of a and b<br>
(a - b) equals zero. As can be seen, the two axes 150 and<br>
152 divide the matrix into four quadrants labeled with num-<br>
bers 1 to 4 .<br>
The first symmetry, assuming that a combination (a, b) and<br>
a combination (-a, -b) are equally probable, is equal to a<br>
point symmetry to the origin, which is explicitly shown for<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
two arbitrary entries 154a (-2,-1) and 154b (2,1) of the<br>
matrix.<br>
An inventive encoder can reduce the size of a required<br>
Huffman codebook by a factor of approximately 2 by perform-<br>
ing a symmetry operation, mirroring the entries of the<br>
third quadrant to the first quadrant and the entries of the<br>
fourth quadrant to the second quadrant. Such, the codebook<br>
entries of the third and forth quadrant can be saved, when<br>
the sign encoder 130 additionally indicates by the sign in-<br>
formation from which quadrant the tuple was coming.<br>
Fig. 4b shows, how the second symmetry can be made use of<br>
by the order coder 120 to reduce the size of the Huffman<br>
codebook by another factor of approximately 2. The second<br>
symmetry, meaning that tuples (a, b) and (b, a) are equally<br>
probable, is equal to a mirroring of the remaining ma-<br>
trix entries at the axis 152. This is for example shown for<br>
the two matrix entries 156a and 156b, showing the mirroring<br>
of the tuple (0, 2) to the tuple (2,0). Therefore, by as-<br>
signing the same code words to corresponding entries of the<br>
second and of the first quadrant, one can save another fac-<br>
tor of 2 in the codebook size. The order coder 120 derives<br>
the order information to preserve the information, whether<br>
the original tuple was from the first or from the second<br>
quadrant.<br>
As illustrated by Figs. 4a and 4b, an inventive encoder in-<br>
corporating a sign encoder and an order encoder allows that<br>
only one out of four quadrants has to be covered by Huffman<br>
codes. A two-bit postfix code determines a unique mapping<br>
between every pair of values in one of the four quadrants<br>
and its corresponding pair of values in the remaining three<br>
quadrants. Note that for pairs of values situated on either<br>
quadrant borderline, the postfix code consists of one bit<br>
only or can even be omitted in case of the pair of values<br>
situated on both borderlines, i.e. at the center of the ma-<br>
trix .<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
Following the symmetry operations shown in Figs. 4a and 4b,<br>
it can be fortunate to reorder (map) the pairs of values in<br>
the remaining quadrant into a quadratic matrix for practi-<br>
cal reasons, since running an algorithm on a quadratic rep-<br>
resentation is much more convenient.<br>
A mapping strategy incorporated by one embodiment of the<br>
present invention is shown in Fig. 5. The original matrix<br>
with the first quadrant to be mapped to a quadratic ma-<br>
trix 160 is shown to the left. The quadratic matrix 160<br>
also has parameter values for parameter a on the X-axis and<br>
parameter values for parameter b on the Y-axis. The reor-<br>
dering following the mapping algorithm is indicated in the<br>
drawing, where each of the matrix elements is marked with a<br>
unique number. It is to be noted, that tuples whose infor-<br>
mation values sum to an even number (a+b is even, which is<br>
true for all lightly shaded matrix elements of the first<br>
quadrant) are reordered to the lower left side of the quad-<br>
ratic matrix 160, whereas tuples having odd sums of infor-<br>
mation values (unshaded elements) are reordered to the up-<br>
per right side of the matrix 160, being unshaded in Figure<br>
5.<br>
After the above mapping process, the tuples to be Huffman<br>
encoded are given in a quadratic representation and thus<br>
are easy to handle.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a block diagram of an inventive decoder for<br>
decoding code words that are based on information values.<br>
The decoder 200 comprises an input interface 202, a code<br>
processor 204, and a degrouper 206. The input interface 202<br>
provides code words 210a, 210b and 212 and associated<br>
therewith order information 214a, 214b and 216, both are<br>
transferred to the code processor 204.<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
The code processor derives tuples of information val-<br>
ues 218a, 218b, and 218c using a decoding rule, where the<br>
decoding rule is such, that different tuples are derived<br>
from the same code word, the different tuples having the<br>
same information values in different tuple orders, as indi-<br>
cated by a differing order information.<br>
Therefore, the differing tuples 218a, and 218c are derived<br>
from the same code words 210a and 210b, since having asso-<br>
ciated different order information 214a and 214b. The tu-<br>
ples of information values 218a to 218c are then degrouped<br>
by the degrouper 206 to yield the information values 220.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a preferred inventive decoder, wherein the<br>
code processor 204 includes an entropy decoder 222 and an<br>
order decoder 224.<br>
The entropy decoder 222 assigns, using a Huffman codebook,<br>
the code words 210a, 210b, and 212 to tuple 226a to 226c,<br>
respectively. The tuples 226a to 226c are transferred to<br>
the order decoder 224 that also receives the associating<br>
order information. The order decoder 224 derives the infor-<br>
mation values modifying the tuples 226a to 226c, as indi-<br>
cated by the order information. The derived final tu-<br>
ples 228a to 228c are then transferred to the degrou-<br>
per 206, that degroups the tuples 228a to 228c to derive<br>
the information values 220.<br>
Fig. 8 shows another preferred embodiment of an inventive<br>
decoder 200, where the code processor 204 further includes<br>
a sign decoder 230.<br>
The input interface provides three identical code<br>
words 232a to 232c, sign information bits 234a to 234c and<br>
order information bits 236a to 236c.<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
The entropy decoder 222 decodes the three identical code<br>
words 232a to 232c into three identical tuples 238a to<br>
238c, which are then transferred to the sign decoder 230.<br>
The sign decoder 230 additionally receives the sign infor-<br>
mation 234a to 234c and modifies the tuples 238a to 238c,<br>
as indicated by the sign information 234a to 234c, to de-<br>
rive the tuples 240a to 240c, that are now having informa-<br>
tion values with correct signs.<br>
The tuples 240a to 240c are transferred to the order de-<br>
coder 224, that additionally receives the order informa-<br>
tion 236a to 236c, and that alters the order of information<br>
values within the tuples 204a to 240c to receive the cor-<br>
rectly ordered tuples 242a to 242c. The tuples 242a to 242c<br>
are then transferred to the degrouper 206, that derives the<br>
information values 220 by degrouping the tuples 242a to<br>
242c.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of inventive encoders<br>
shown in the figures 2 and 3 propose, that the order en-<br>
coder 120 and the sign encoder 130 retrieve the order or<br>
sign information and do simultaneously alter the tuples, it<br>
is alternatively possible that the sign encoder and the or-<br>
der encoder retrieve the order and sign information without<br>
altering the tuples. A Huffman Codebook has to be designed<br>
such then, that tuples with different sign and order<br>
informations are assigned the same code words.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments shown in the figures de-<br>
tail the concept of the present invention by using two-<br>
dimensional Huffman codebooks, the inventive idea of using<br>
grouped values and making use of their symmetries can also<br>
be combined with other lossless encoding methods, espe-<br>
cially with Huffman codebooks of higher dimensions, i.e.<br>
building tuples having more information values than two.<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b show a way to derive the symmetry informa-<br>
tion used to allow for a smaller Huffman codebook. In a<br>
first step the third and forth quadrant of a given matrix<br>
is mapped to the first and second quadrant. It is alterna-<br>
tively also possible to map other combinations of two<br>
neighboring quadrants to the remaining two quadrants, as<br>
long as the symmetry information is preserved such that the<br>
mapping can be reversed. The same is also true for the sec-<br>
ond symmetry operation shown in Fig. 4b.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a way of mapping one quadrant of a matrix into<br>
a quadratic matrix allowing to describe a codebook of re-<br>
duced size. This mapping is an example for multiple possi-<br>
ble mapping schemes, wherein the mappings only have to be<br>
such that they are unique and can be reversed.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the in-<br>
ventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be per-<br>
formed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disk, DVD or a CD having electronically readable control<br>
signals stored thereon, which cooperate with a programmable<br>
computer system such that the inventive methods are per-<br>
formed. Generally, the present invention is, therefore, a<br>
computer program product with a program code stored on a<br>
machine readable carrier, the program code being operative<br>
for performing the inventive methods when the computer pro-<br>
gram product runs on a computer. In other words, the inven-<br>
tive methods are, therefore, a computer program having a<br>
program code for performing at least one of the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>

scribed with reference to particular embodiments thereof,<br>
it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various other changes in the form and details may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. It is<br>

code word is assigned to different tuples having infor-<br>
mation values of same absolute value in the same order<br>
differing by the sign of each information value in the<br>
tuple; and<br>
outputting the code word and in association therewith<br>
the order information and the sign information.<br>
21. A method for decoding code words based on information<br>
values, the method comprising:<br>
providing the code word and in association therewith an<br>
order information indicating a tuple order, being an<br>
order of two or more information values within a tuple<br>
of information values and in further association a sign<br>
information, indicating a sign combination for the in-<br>
formation values within a tuple;<br>
deriving a tuple using a decoding rule depending on an<br>
encoding rule used to create the code word, where the<br>
decoding rule is such, that different tuples having the<br>
same information values in different orders are derived<br>
from the same code word associated by different order<br>
information and different tuples having information<br>
values of same absolute value in the same order differ-<br>
ing by the sign of each information value in the tuple<br><br>
-29-<br>
are derived from the same code word associated by dif-<br>
ferent sign information;<br>
degrouping the tuples into two or more information val-<br>
ues; and<br>
differential decoding of the information values to ob-<br>
tain a differentially decoded representation of the in-<br>
formation values.<br>
22. Computer program having a program code for performing,<br>
when running on a computer, a method for encoding in-<br>
formation values, the method comprising:<br>
differentially encoding of input values to obtain a<br>
differentially encoded representation of the input val-<br>
ues as the information values;<br>
grouping two or more information values into a tuple in<br>
a tuple order;<br>
generating order information indicating the tuple or-<br>
der;<br>
generating sign information indicating a sign of the<br>
information values within the tuple;<br>
generating a code word for the tuple using an encoding<br>
rule, where the encoding rule is such that the same<br>
code word is assigned to different tuples having the<br>
same information values in different orders and wherein<br>
the encoding rule is furthermore such that the same<br>
code word is assigned to different tuples having infor-<br>
mation values of same absolute value in the same order<br>
differing by the sign of each information value in the<br>
tuple; and<br><br>
-30-<br><br>
outputting the code word and in association therewith<br>
the order information and the sign information.<br>
23.	Computer program having a program code for performing,<br>
when running on a computer, a method for decoding code<br>
words based on information values, the method compris-<br>
ing:<br>
providing the code word and in association therewith an<br>
order information indicating a tuple order, being an<br>
order of two or more information values within a tuple<br>
of information values and in further association a sign<br>
information, indicating a sign combination for the in-<br>
formation values within a tuple;<br>
deriving a tuple using a decoding rule depending on an<br>
encoding rule used to create the code word, where the<br>
decoding rule is such, that different tuples having the<br>
same information values in different orders are derived<br>
from the same code word associated by different order<br>
information and different tuples having information<br>
values of same absolute value in the same order differ-<br>
ing by the sign of each information value in the tuple<br>
are derived from the same code word associated by dif-<br>
ferent sign information;<br>
degrouping the tuples into two or more information val-<br>
ues; and<br>
differential decoding of the information values to ob-<br>
tain a differentially decoded representation of the in-<br>
formation values.<br>
24.	Encoded data based on information values, the encoded<br>
data comprising a code word for a tuple of two or more<br>
information values arranged in the tuple in a tuple or-<br>
der; an order information indicating the tuple order<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
and sign information, indicating a sign combination for<br>
the information values within a tuple.<br>
25. Encoded data in accordance with claim 24, which is<br>
stored on a computer readable media.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that an efficient code for encoding information values can be derived,<br>
when two or more information values are grouped in a tuple<br>
in a tuple order and when an encoding rule is used, that<br>
assigns the same code word to tuples having identical information values in different orders and that does derive<br>
an order information, indicating the tuple order, and when<br>
the code word is output in association with the order information.<br></td>
