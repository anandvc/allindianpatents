DETECTION CONVERTER SLIP ACCELERATION<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to monitoring performance of<br>
a torque converter clutch in a motor vehicle<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art<br>
[0003] Starting with Figure 1, vehicles traditionally include a power<br>
plant, such as an internal combustion engine 102, that generates drive torque<br>
The drive torque is transferred through a powertrain and a dnveline 104 to a<br>
dnven wheel or wheels 106, which propel the vehicle along a surface The<br>
powertrain 104 often includes an automatic transmission 108 that is coupled<br>
to the engine 102 by a torque converter 110, which is a type of fluid coupling,<br>
which allows the engine 102 to spin somewhat independently of the<br>
transmission 108<br>
[0004] Turning now to Figure 2, a typical torque converter 110 is<br>
made up of a turbine 200, a pump 202, a stator 204, and transmission fluid<br>
The housing 206 of the torque converter 110 is bolted to the flywheel 208 of<br>
the engine, and thus turns at the same speed as the engine The fins that<br>
make up the pump 202 of the torque converter 110 are attached to the<br>
housing 206, so they also turn at the same speed as the engine<br>
[0005] The pump 202 inside a torque converter is a type of<br>
centrifugal pump As it spins, fluid is flung to the outside As fluid is flung to<br>
the outside, a vacuum is created that draws more fluid in at the center The<br>
fluid then enters the blades of the turbine 200, which is connected to the<br>
transmission by turbine output shaft 210 The turbine 200 causes the<br>
transmission to spin, which moves the vehicle Since the blades of the turbine<br>
200 are curved, the fluid, which enters the turbine 200 from the outside, has to<br><br>
change direction before it exits the center of the turbine 200 This directional<br>
change causes the turbine 200 to spin<br>
[0006] The fluid exits the turbine 200 at the center, moving in a<br>
different direction than when it entered The fluid exits the turbine 200 moving<br>
in an opposite direction than one in which the pump 202 (and engine) are<br>
turning If the fluid were allowed to hit the pump 202, it would slow the engine<br>
down, wasting power Therefore, a torque converter 110 has a stator 204 to<br>
prevent this waste of power<br>
[0007] The stator 204 resides in the very center of the torque<br>
converter 110 It is connected to a fixed shaft in the transmission by stator<br>
output shaft 212 The job of the stator 204 is to redirect the fluid returning<br>
from the turbine 200 before it hits the pump 202 again This redirection<br>
dramatically increases the efficiency of the torque converter 110<br>
[0008] In some cases, there can be a lock-up clutch, which can<br>
create a firm connection between the pump 202 and turbine 200 The clutch<br>
is usually only engaged when a speed ratio of 1 1 has been achieved<br>
between turbine 200 and pump 202<br>
[0009] Turning now to Figure 3, strategies for delivering power<br>
directly from the crankshaft into an automatic transmission have ranged from<br>
a purely mechanical connection via a high clutch drum and shaft transmitted<br>
through a damper plate assembly, to an actual clutch apply, all taking place<br>
inside the torque converter's fluid coupling The converter clutch apply<br>
method has been the strategy of choice among vehicle manufacturers This<br>
strategy has gone through several changes through the years Some<br>
previous strategies have used a simple ON/OFF solenoid 300 in conjunction<br>
with an encapsulated check ball assembly 302 at the tip of the input shaft<br>
The solenoid 300 turns the clutch on and off while the check ball assisted in a<br>
controlled apply of the clutch<br><br>
[0010] In more recent strategies, a pulse width modulated (PWM)<br>
torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid 304 is added to the system in order to<br>
enhance converter clutch engagement for improved fuel economy A<br>
powertram control module (PCM) provides a duty cycle to this pulse width<br>
modulated (PWM) solenoid 304, which in turn regulates the pressure in the<br>
TCC hydraulic circuit, allowing the torque converter clutch to apply gradually<br>
As apply pressure is increased, slip is also increased proportionally<br>
Therefore, the amount of slip that occurs during the apply is proportional to<br>
the duty cycle<br>
[0011] The construction of the PWM solenoid 304 is such that when<br>
the solenoid 304 is completely turned off, feed pressure (AFL) to the solenoid<br>
304 is blocked at the solenoid 304 When the solenoid 304 is duty-cycled, it<br>
opens to a circuit that allows pressure to act on the isolator valve 306 This<br>
increases the spnng tension acting on the TCC regulator valve 308, which<br>
then increases regulated TCC apply pressure As the duty cycle decreases,<br>
the regulated apply pressure decreases As the duty cycle increases, so does<br>
the regulated apply pressure As mentioned above, more pressure equals<br>
less slip and visa versa The relationship between fluid apply pressure and<br>
input of the pressure control solenoid is essentially linear, and can be<br>
described by the following equation<br>
y = mx + b,<br>
where y is fluid apply pressure, a is gain of the regulator valve, x is input of<br>
the pressure control solenoid, and b is offset of the solenoid spring<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality<br>
[0025] The slip rate monitoring system and method according to the<br>
present invention can be implemented in various ways For example, the slip<br>
rate monitoring system and method can include or employ a third order<br>
Kalman filter Alternatively or additionally, the slip rate monitoring system and<br>
method can include or employ a rating module to rate torque converter clutch<br>
performance in order to provide feedback to system designers Alternatively<br>
or additionally, the slip rate monitoring system and method can be employed<br>
as a component of a torque converter clutch apply adapt update system and<br>
method Moreover, it should be readily understood that these embodiments<br>
can be combined to accomplish a torque converter clutch apply adapt update<br>
system that employs a third order Kalman filter and includes a rating module<br>
Therefore, it should also be readily understood that, although the slip rate<br>
monitoring system and method is described below with respect to such a<br>
combination, the slip rate monitoring system and method is not embodied<br>
solely in such a combination<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figures 4-6, an exemplary vehicle system<br>
10 includes an engine 12 that generates drive torque More specifically, air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16 The air is mixed with<br>
fuel, and the fuel and air mixture is combusted within a cylinder 18 to<br>
reciprocally drive a piston (not shown), which rotatably drives a crankshaft<br>
(not shown) Exhaust, resulting from the combustion process, is exhausted<br><br>
through an exhaust manifold 20, is treated in an after-treatment system (not<br>
shown) and is released to atmosphere<br>
[0027] The crankshaft dnves an automatic transmission 22 through<br>
a torque converter 24 The transmission 22 includes an input shaft (not<br>
shown) and an output shaft 26, which transmits drive torque through a<br>
dnveline (not shown) to rotatably dnve a wheel or wheels 28<br>
[0028] "A control module 30 regulates overall operation of the<br>
vehicle system 10 More specifically, the control module 30 receives vehicle<br>
operating parameter signals from a plurality of sensors and controls the<br>
system 10 based thereon Exemplary sensors include a mass air flow (MAF)<br>
sensor 32, a throttle position sensor 34, a manifold absolute pressure (MAP)<br>
sensor 36 and an engine RPM sensor 38<br>
[0029] The sensors also include a turbine speed sensor 40 that<br>
generates a signal based on the rotation of the turbine of the torque converter<br>
24 More specifically, the turbine speed sensor 40 is responsive to a toothed<br>
wheel 42 that is fixed for rotation with the turbine output shaft The turbine<br>
speed sensor 40 generates a pulse signal or output shaft signal (OSS) 44,<br>
wherein the pulses correspond to the rising and falling edges of the teeth of<br>
the toothed wheel 42 The OSS 44 is transmitted to the control module 30<br>
[0030] In the control module 30, a hardware input/output driver 46<br>
processes the OSS 44 pulse period and pulse count to obtain a raw turbine<br>
shaft speed 48, which is then compared to raw engine speed 50 to obtain a<br>
raw slip speed 52 This raw slip speed serves as input to a 3rd order Kalman<br>
filter 54, which calculates the TCC slip acceleration 56 In addition to the slip<br>
acceleration 56, the Kalman filter 54 also calculates speed 58 and jerk 60<br><br>
During this process, filter 54 calculates error 62 by comparing the measured<br>
OSS to an estimated OSS The process of the Kalman filter can be described<br>
by the following equations<br>
Error = raw measured signal - estimated signal,<br>
E(k) = Y(k)-X1(k-1),<br>
X1(K)= X1(K-1)+ T*X2(k-1) + E(k)* K1,<br>
X2(K)= X2(K-1)+ T*X3(k-1) + E(k)* K2,<br>
X3(K)=X3(K-1)+E(k)*K3,<br>
Y(k) measured raw signal from the sensor,<br>
X1 Estimated signal,<br>
X2 Estimated acceleration,<br>
X3 Estimated acceleration derivative (Jerk),<br>
T Filter sampling period<br>
As mentioned above, measured raw signal is equal to<br>
TCC Slip raw = Engine rpm raw - Turbine speed raw<br>
[0031] Turning now to Figures 7-8, the TCC apply adapt update<br>
system is able to determine a difference 66 between a desired slip rate 68<br>
and an actual slip rate 70 occurnng as a result of a slow apply The system<br>
employs this difference 66 to adapt the apply pressure rate at the solenoid 72<br>
(Fig 4) in order to adjust an actual slip 74 to be within upper and lower<br>
bounds 76A-B in order to achieve an ideal slip curve 78 In other words, the<br>
system first utilizes a third order Kalman filter to calculate torque acceleration<br>
of converter slip Then, if the rate of change of the slip value during an apply<br>
is less than desired, then adapt apply pressure rate is updated based on<br>
apply turbine torque in order to reduce apply pressure rate On the other<br>
hand, if the rate of change of the slip value during the apply is greater than<br>
desired, then the adapt apply pressure rate is updated based on apply turbine<br>
torque in order to increase apply pressure rate To this end, the system<br>
employs an adapt cell map 80 having adapt cells arrayed by turbine torque<br>
The system monitors the slip rate during a pulldown while using the update<br><br>
cells 82A-E of the map 80 obtained during an immediately previous pulldown<br>
Then, the cells 82A-E are updated for use in a next pulldown<br>
[0032] The amount of adapt correction is a function of slip rate error<br>
(slip rate - threshold)<br>
Adapt_Ramp = Adapt_Ramp + correction term,<br>
TCC Apply Pressure = TCC Operting point + Ramp + Adapt_Ramp<br>
+ On_Ramp<br>
Torque converter clutch apply is a function of torque converter slip rate of<br>
change and is looked up once per apply Apply thresholds are predetermined<br>
calibrations<br>
[0033] Turning now to Figure 9, a TCC apply adapt update method<br>
begins by calculating TCC slip acceleration at step 84 using the third order<br>
Kalman filter If the TCC is in the apply mode as at decision step 86, then slip<br>
rate pulldown is monitored dunng the apply at step 88 For example, if the<br>
offset adjusted slip acceleration falls above or below predefined thresholds<br>
during the apply as at decision steps 88A1 and 88A2, then the highest or<br>
lowest peak value of acceleration slip can be recorded, along with the turbine<br>
torque during the pulldown at step 88B In other words, if slip acceleration<br>
dunng the apply is outside the nominal range, then the TCC apply pressure'<br>
adapt correction is required The pressure adapt cells are a (17 cells) table<br>
function of turbine torque,<br>
Cell (x) = Cell (x) + adapt correction<br>
The adapt apply ramp can be adjusted according to the pulldown rate error<br>
and turbine torque at step 88C Based on the highest or lowest peak value of<br>
TCC slip acceleration, a signed pressure modifier correction can be added to<br>
the adapt cell (increase or decrease) at the corresponding turbine torque<br>
The TCC pressure correction modifier value is looked up from a<br>
predetermined calibration table This update of the apply adapt cells can be<br>
performed during the apply ramp or after completion of the pulldown Even of<br>
several cells are incorrect, iterative update of the most incorrect cell over<br>
several pulldowns can arrive deliberately and accurately at a slip rate within a<br><br>
predetermined range of acceptability for the entire pulldown However, it<br>
should also be readily understood that additional or alternative embodiments<br>
can update more than one cell after a pulldown, including some or all of the<br>
cells that, when used to accomplish the pulldown, result in a significant<br>
deviation from the ideal slip acceleration for their respective turbine torque<br>
values<br>
[0034] Once the apply is determined to be complete at decision step<br>
90, then the TCC apply quality can be rated based on the slip rate and the<br>
apply time at step 92 in order to provide feedback to system designers In<br>
particular, based on TCC slip acceleration, the pulldown can be rated based<br>
on a predetermined TCC slip acceleration vs TCC quality rating table This<br>
rating can be a real time feedback to the engineer that can be used during the<br>
development phase of the product<br>
[0035] The TCC apply adapt update system and method yields<br>
several accomplishments For example, it accomplishes real time adaptation<br>
of torque converter clutch apply that can be derived with good accuracy and<br>
repeatability Also, it serves as an aid to calibration engineers in GMUT<br>
quantifying TCC applies Additionally, it accomplishes go/no-no testing for<br>
transmission misbuilds at assembly plants Further, it increases long term<br>
torque converter durability<br>
[0036] Returning now to Figure 4, it should be readily understood<br>
that control module 30 can have various functional modules for carrying out<br>
the functions of the system and steps of the method For example, control<br>
module 30 can have a slip rate calculation module, such as a third order<br>
Kalman filter, calculating torque converter clutch slip acceleration as a<br>
function of raw slip speed of a torque converter clutch Also, control module<br>
30 can have a torque converter clutch slip rate monitoring module in<br>
communication with the slip rate calculation module and operating to (1)<br>
detect a deviation of the slip acceleration from an acceptable range dunng a<br>
pulldown of the torque converter clutch, and (2) record a value of the deviation<br>
together with a turbine torque at which the deviation occurred<br><br>
[0037] In some embodiments, control module 30 can have an apply<br>
adapt cell update module in communication with the monitoring module and<br>
operating to perform an adjustment to an apply adapt cell in computer<br>
readable memory that is employed to accomplish the pulldown The cell<br>
being adapted can correspond to the turbine torque at which the deviation<br>
occurred The adjustment can be performed in order to decrease the<br>
deviation during a subsequent pulldown<br>
[0038] In some embodiments, the monitoring module can compare<br>
the slip acceleration during the pulldown of the torque converter clutch to<br>
predetermined thresholds defining the range of acceptable slip acceleration<br>
and, if the slip acceleration is found to be unacceptable, record a value of<br>
greatest deviation of the slip acceleration outside of the range of acceptable<br>
slip acceleration along with the corresponding turbine torque at which the<br>
value of greatest deviation occurred In these and additional or alternative<br>
embodiments, the update module can add a signed pressure modifier<br>
correction to the apply adapt cell corresponding to the turbine torque at which<br>
the greatest deviation occurred by retrieving a value of the signed pressure<br>
modifier correction from a predetermined calibration table by the value of the<br>
greatest deviation<br>
[0039] Additional components of control module 30 can include a<br>
computer readable memory storing a data structure containing apply adapt<br>
cells arranged according to turbine torque Similarly, control module 30 can<br>
include a powertrain control module in communication with the memory and<br>
employing the adapt cells to adjust control of a solenoid governing fluid<br>
pressure in the torque converter clutch during a pulldown of the torque<br>
converter clutch The solenoid 72 can be in communication with this<br>
powertrain control module and responsive to control by the powertrain control<br>
module to govern fluid pressure in the torque converter clutch<br><br>
[0040] Also, control module 30 can have a raw slip speed<br>
calculation module in communication with the third order Kalman filter and<br>
calculating the raw slip speed by comparing a turbine speed to an engine<br>
speed Turbine speed sensor 40 can be in communication with this raw slip<br>
speed calculation module, and can operate to detect speed of the turbine of<br>
the torque converter clutch and generate a signal indicating the raw turbine<br>
speed Similarly, engine speed sensor 38 can be in communication with the<br>
raw slip speed calculation module, and can operate to detect engine speed<br>
and generate a signal indicating engine speed<br>
[0041] In additional or alternative embodiments, another functional<br>
module that can be included in control module 30 can be a rating module<br>
generating a rating of torque converter clutch apply quality in order to provide<br>
feedback to system designers In some embodiments, the pulldown can be<br>
rated as a function of slip rate and apply time with reference to a slip<br>
acceleration versus torque converter clutch quality rating table This rating<br>
can be stored in computer readable memory for reference by system<br>
designers, and/or communicated to system designers by a user interface It<br>
should be readily understood that the rating module can alternatively be<br>
separate from the control module 30, such as in the case of a computer<br>
workstation receiving the slip acceleration data into computer readable<br>
memory and producing the rating for the system designers<br>
[0042] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
