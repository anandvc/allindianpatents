				<td>The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a coated substrate to be used as but not limited to automobile antiglare filter. The invention more particularly relates to an improved antiglare optical device and antiglare article made thereof. Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of deposition of an absorbing material upon plastic/glass substrate by vacuum coating at an angle of inclination between 5° to 30° an using a mask on the evaporation source to produce a graded film material. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of graded density absorbing film useful as an antiglare optical device for protecting the eyes by reducing the glare by absorbing the light intensity falling upon it in a non-uniform fashion. Background Art<br>
The necessity of Night driving filter was felt as in the night time It becomes very difficult to drive on the high ways due to the radiations falling on the eye of incoming vehicles 01 the driver's eye, The excessive radiations falling on the eye makes the eye pupil to close resulting in the darkness of the view in front of the driver and accidents occur. Also the UV and IR content of the radiations make the eyes prone to cataract and other diseases. This made it essential to have device which removes this excessive radiations.<br>
During night driving, the headlights of the vehicles approaching in the opposite direction emit radiations in the wavelength of 320-400 nm and 750-1400nm. These radiations blind the driver, due to which a number of accidents occur in the night. The frequent blinding glare not only makes the driving difficult, but also impairs the vision. The impairment of the vision occurs due to development of cataract in the crystalline lens by the UV radiation and also retinal deterioration caused due to the thermal effects of IR radiation in the long run.<br>
To reduce the blinding effect produced by an approaching vehicle many plastic goggle have been manufactured. A reference may be made to the night driving plastic goggle manufactured by M/s Proview Optical Corporation, Taiwan wherein yellow colored plastic To reduce the blinding effect produced by an approaching vehicle many plastic goggles have been manufactured. A reference may be made to the night driving plastic goggles manufactured by M/s Proview Optical Corporation, Taiwan wherein yellow colored plastic is used whose spectral profile is shown in Fig. 1. The transmission table is given as Table 2. The drawbacks with these goggles as inferred from the spectral profile are as follows:<br>
1.	It reduces the transmission in the wavelength region 300 - 540 nm over the entire surface area<br>
thereby it also suppresses visualisation of the road on the left side.<br>
2.	It does not completely block the blinding glare entering the eyes from the right hand side of the<br>
windshield as it is transmitting more than 70% of the radiation in the wavelength region 550 - 750<br><br>
nm.<br>
3. Due to selective transmission in the visible region i.e. having absorption in the blue region, it<br>
distorts the color of the objects which might effect the recognition of the person wearing blue color<br>
clothes.<br>
Another reference may be made to St. Martin sunglasses manufactured and distributed b Mis<br>
Thukral Optics, New Delhi wherein spectacle glasses are claimed to be used as anti radiation for<br>
filtering out UV and IR radiation from computer monitors and TV screen a well as for night driving<br>
to prevent blind spot. However, the literature of the product does not give any spectral curve or<br>
technical clarifications justifying the use of spectacle glasses for night driving.<br>

400-1400 nm:	Neutral; neutrality within ± 10% of the value at 550 nm<br><br>
Example 2: Computation of Thickness Gradation<br>
The film gradation is designed by taking into consideration the luminance distribution of light on the wind shield from the approaching vehicle, distance between the two vehicles and the distance of the filter from the center of rotation of the eye. In this connection, the necessary data has been generated by conducting the requisite experiments. From this data of luminance distribution the thickness gradation of the film in terms of transmission is found for getting gradient density absorbing film . The required gradation profile is given in Fig.3<br>
Example 3: Experimental methods<br>
The glass/plastic substrate after proper cleaning is placed inside the chamber of a vacuum coating plant in an inclined position with respect to evaporation source. The angle of inclination varies from 5° to 30°. Tungsten spiral filament is used as the source for the evaporation of absorbing material and a mask is suitably positioned above the filament; the chamber is then evacuated to a high vacuum. After achieving the vacuum better than 2 x 10 ~ 5 mb the material is evaporated by passing the current in the filament to obtain the graded absorbing film on the substrate. Afterwards AR film is deposited on both surfaces by suitably placing the substrate in the chamber. Figure 3, depicts the gradation profile of the experimental coating without having AR coating on both surfaces. The data for the profile was obtained by measuring the transmission at 550 nm on various locations of the filter. It can be seen from the figure that at a distance of 100 mm from RHS, the absorbance is highest because it is at this point the intensity of light (Glare) is maximum therefore it gets absorbed to the maximum extent and is not felt by the driver. The coated substrate is assembled in the adjustable mechanical mount as shown in figure 2, and then fitted in the car. This mount has the mechanism to flip the filter in and out of driver's field of view on the windshield. Figure 2 clearly shows the various means and parts of the anti glare device capable of being fitted into an automobile. The anti glare device (1) can be attached with the front roof or any suitable structure falling in the front field of view of the driver by a suitable connecting means (2). This connecting means could be a nut and bolt arrangement. A rod (3) capable of being rotated in the horizontal plane is attached with the connecting means (2). Both edges of the rod (3) have means for fixing anti reflective panel (4). The fixing means are capable of rotating the panel in the vertical plane, as well as providing up and down movement to the panel. The panel is coated with anti reflective material, which acts as a filter (5).<br><br>
Thickness of the coating is determined in terms of transmission of the gradient density absorbing coating. Reference may be made to Figure 3 where the variation in transmission is shown as 35 to 75%.<br>
The transmission of the coating during deposition is controlled in such a way that the following transmission data is obtained on the substrate:<br><br>

Example 4: Environmental and other Tests done on the filter.<br>
1- Hardness Test : This was done by using the coating Hardness tester of summer laboratories , USA as per standard no. Mil -C-675 A where it is mentioned that no scratch should be visible after subjecting the coated sample to 20 complete strokes of 1" length with a rubber eraser conforming to MIL -E- 12397 under a force of 2.5 pounds. The coated sample has passed the test as no scratches appeared.<br>
2.	Adhesion Test:   The coated sample has passed the test as no peel-off is seen. The<br>
coated component was subjected to adhesion test as per MEL standard no. MIL- F-<br>
48616. In this test 1/2" wide cellophane tape conforming to type I of L-T-90 is used.<br>
The adhesive tape is pressed so as to cover the coated surface and thcr. quickly<br>
removed at an angle normal to the coated surface. After removal of the tape the coated<br>
surface is examined for any peel-off.<br>
3.	Climatic &amp; Environmental Tests :<br><br>
a)	Heat Test: The coated sample was kept in an environment of 65°C temperature for<br>
three hours.<br>
b)	Heat &amp; Humidity Test: The samples were kept in an environment of 40° C and 95<br>
% RH for 3 cycles of 24 hours duration.<br>
c)	Salt spray Test: The samples were subjected to a spray of salt mixture for 2 hours<br>
and then kept in the same environment for 24 hours.<br>
After the above-mentioned environmental tests, the samples were evaluated by visual examination, adhesion, hardness and spectral transmission,<br>
No damage was observed in the visual examination and it has passed the Hardness, Adhesion tests.<br><br>
Spectral transmission was measured on the Perkin -Elmer spectrophotometer. It is observed that there was no appreciable variation of T % of the samples. Preliminary user's trials have been conducted by mounting the improvised device on the windshield of the ambassador car and driving on the city roads (single &amp; dual carriageway) and on the highways in the night which have yielded encouraging response. Reference may be made to Table 1 for the online performance trials. Further work to fabricate the complete device, technical and user's trials and also on plastic substrates are being carried out.<br>
