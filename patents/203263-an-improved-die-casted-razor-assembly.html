sides secured tightly for better grip. The free end to the plunger<br>
member is urged by the coil spring into engagement<br>
with	the	said	blade	assembly	cam	means.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Two shell bearings are provided for pressing against the blade assembly under the two side guide pads thereby forcing the plunger member downwardly and removing the detents from the opening and during pivot operation of the blade assembly, the free end of the plunger member bears against the cam means to urge the blade assembly to a given position. The two arms which extend beyond the sides of the handle and are accessible to an operator. Each of the shell bearings is provided with an opening adopted to receive respectively the detents.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction are described with reference to with accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular shaving implement embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention.<br>
Figure 1.    shows a top plan view of one of razor assembly. Figure 2.     shows a front elevational view of the blade assembly.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Figure 3.    shows a bottom view of the blade assembly.<br>
Figure 4.     shows   a   side   elevational   view   of  the   handle   assembly<br>
illustrative of an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 5.     shows  a  front elevational view of the die casted handle<br>
assembly.<br>
Figure 6.     shows  a back elevational view of the  die  casted  handle<br>
assembly.<br>
Figure 7.     shows a sectional view of the blade assembly attached to the<br>
handle assembly taken generally along the length wise center line of<br>
blade assembly with part broken away for clarity.<br>
Figure 8.     shows  side view of die  casted  handle  assembly showing<br>
recess in the head and grip portion.<br>
Figure 9.     shows exploded view of handle assembly parts.<br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawings of Figure 1 to 9 and particularly in Figure 9, it will be seen that the illustrated die casted razor handle assembly comprises a razor handle (20) made out of aluminum or like material in a pressure die casting process and the handle head portion (25) is provided with recess (30) in which is disposed a moulded plastic head portion (40) comprising two arms (50, 60) joined by connecting portion secured in the handle.<br><br>
- 7 -In the handle recess there is disposed a coil spring (70) and a<br>
plunger member (80) the coil spring biasing the plunger member in<br>
direction of a free end (90) in the blade assembly (10) is connected to<br>
the handle assembly (20) the free end of the plunger member (80) is<br>
urged by the coil spring (70) into engagement with the blade assembly<br>
cam means (100). During pivot operation of the blade assembly (10) the<br>
plunger member free end (90) bears agains the cam means (100) to urge<br>
the blade assembly to a given position. The position in which the<br>
plunger member free end rest at an apex of the cam means.<br>
The two arms (50, 60) extend beyond the sides of the handle and are accessible to an operator. The arms are biased outwardly by a leaf spring(110) disposed in head portion. To connect the blade assembly to the handle assembly the operator presses on two arms inwardly towards each other against the bias of the coil spring (70), moving the two shell bearings (120, 130) towards each other.<br>
The plunger member (80) is provided with oppositely extending arms (140, 150) each having upstanding their from the detent. Each of the shell bearings(120, 130) is provided with an opening adopted to receive restructively the detents. As the two shell bearings are pressed inwardly towards one another the opening align with the detents respectively. Upon such alignment the coil spring (70) urges the plunger member (80) and thereby the detents move upwardly such that the detents entering the opening to lock the two arms in an inwardly flexed position. Upon release of the two arms by the operator the arms remain locked in the inwardly flexed position.<br><br>
- 8 -The two shell bearings  (120, 130) are then pressed against the<br>
blade assembly under two side guide pads (95, 96) forcing the plunger<br>
member downwardly and removing the detents from the opening, the<br>
arms being thereby released. Upon release of two arms (50, 60) the arms<br>
springs outwardly in opposite direction away from each other under<br>
influence of this coil spring (70), the two shell bearings entering the two<br>
side guide pads.<br>
The spring biased plunger member engages the cam means (100) seeking the apex of the cam means and thereby urging the blade assembly to a neutral position. During shaving operation the blade assembly as a whole pivots on the handle following the contours of the surface being shaved.<br>
When it is desired to discard used blade assembly (10) the operator need only to compress the two arms removing the shell bearings from the guide pads and releasing the blade assembly.<br>
The grip portion of the razor handle assembly (20) is provided with serrated rubber pads (26, 27) on both sides. These pads secured in the recess (170) provided in the aluminum die casted handle for better grip during shaving operation.<br><br>
