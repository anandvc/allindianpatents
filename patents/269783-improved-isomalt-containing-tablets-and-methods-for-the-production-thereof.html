3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The present invention relates to improved isomalt-containing compressed products and methods to produce the same.<br>
In the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms, extreme attention is paid to the bioavailability of the active ingredients. Compressed products, also known as tablets, are frequently used for administering pharmaceutically active ingredients. To systematically release these active ingredients, in galenics, tablets with different compositions are provided which have a specific dissolution period, thus disintegration time.<br>
Rapidly disintegrating tablets, so-called "oro-dispersible tablets" (ODT), are increasingly gaining in importance in the market. For this dosage form, a disintegration time in the oral cavity of less than 60 seconds, in particular less than 20 seconds is desired without the need of additional fluid intake.<br>
The use of mixtures of 1,6-GPS (6-O-a-D-Glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol) and 1,1-GPM (1-O-α-D-Glucopyranosyl-D-mannito) for producing tablets is known from DE 196 39 343 Al and DE 199 43 491 Al.<br>
Isomalt is a mixture of the two stereoisomers 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM. Isomalt is also known as Palatinit® or galenlQ®. Isomalt is obtained by hydrogenation of isomaltulose. In pharmacopoeias, isomalt is defined as an at least 98% pure mixture of 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM, wherein none of the two components is contained with less than 3% with respect to the dry substance.<br>
Due to the sensory properties of isomalt, suitability for the use in tablets is principally given.<br>
A technical problem underlying the present invention is the provision of isomalt-containing tablets with improved tablet hardness at the same pressing force. In<br><br>
particular, a technical problem underlying the invention is the provision of isomalt-containing tablets with reduced tablet hardness at the same pressing force.<br>
Another technical problem underlying the present invention is the provision of isomalt-containing tablets with improved dissolution period at the same pressing force. In particular, a technical problem underlying the invention is the provision of isomalt-containing tablets with reduced dissolution period at the same pressing force.<br>
Another technical problem underlying the present invention is the provision of methods for controlling the tablet hardness of isomalt-containing tablets. In particular, a technical problem underlying the invention is the provision of methods for reducing the tablet hardness of isomalt-containing tablets.<br>
Another technical problem underlying the invention is the provision of methods for controlling the dissolution period of isomalt-containing tablets. In particular, a technical problem underlying the invention is the provision of methods for reducing the dissolution period of isomalt-containing tablets.<br>
Another technical problem underlying the present invention is the provision of methods for producing isomalt-containing tablets which contain a small portion of magnesium stearate, in particular isomalt-containing tablets which contain no magnesium stearate, and isomalt-containing tablets themselves.<br>
The invention solves its underlying technical problems by providing methods and tablets according to the claims.<br>

The tablet hardness and the dissolution period of tablets depend, among other things, on the nature and extent of the particle deformation during the pressing process. Nature and extent of the particle deformation depend in turn on the mechanical material properties, in particular the modulus of elasticity, the size of the particles, the shape of the particles, for example the crystal form, the isotropy of the particles, for example defects in the crystal structure, and the position with respect to the applied force.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that tablet hardness and dissolution period of an isomalt-containing tablet change if the isomalt is mixed prior to pressing with additional 1,6-GPS and/or 1,1-GPM. Surprisingly, it was found that the pressing of isomalt with a certain ratio of 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM results in a tablet with a different tablet hardness and/or dissolution period than the same pressing with the same pressing force of a mixture of isomalt and 1,6-GPS and/or 1,1-GPM which overall has the same ratio of 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM. In particular, it was surprisingly found that for an isomalt-containing tablet, the tablet hardness can be reduced and the dissolution period can be shortened by mixing the isomalt with 1,6-GPs and/or 1,1-GPM prior to the pressing. Without being bound by the theory, the different structure of the 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM contained in the isomalt and the additional 1,6-GPS and/or 1,1-<br><br>
GPM could be responsible for the change of the tablet hardness and the dissolution period. For example, the existence of tomahawk structures in the additionally mixed 1,6-GPS and/or 1,1 -GPM could result in a changed overall structure in the tablet. Also, a different distribution of the crystals could influence the tablet hardness and the dissolution period. Without being bound by the theory, isomalt could be present in the form of mosaic crystal structures while the added 1,6-GPS and/or 1,1-GPM do not have a mosaic crystal structure. In this way, tablets which have been produced according to the invention and with comparable grain size could differ in terms of their specific surface from isomalt tablets from the prior art. Also, the different crystal structures in the tablets could result in differences in the microstructural constitution, in particular in different pore diameters and/or pore size distributions.<br>
In connection with the present invention, a compressed product is to be understood as a tablet which is produced from powders and/or granules by applying pressing power. The compressed tablet has a certain tablet hardness.<br>
The tablet hardness can be determined, for example, according to the method according to Ph. Eur. 2.9.8 of the European Pharmacopoeia. For example, as a measuring principle, a load cell with strain gauges can be used. For example, as measuring device, a device TBH 30 from Erweka can be used.<br>
Pressing with a certain pressure power is known to the person skilled in the art. The pressing can be carried out with methods known from the prior art.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the mixture of isomalt and 1,6-GPS and/or 1,1-GPM is directly pressed. Preferably, according to the invention, the mixture of isomalt and 1,6-GPS is directly pressed. Preferably, according to the invention, the mixture of isomalt and 1,1-GPM is directly pressed.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of 1.0 to 15.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a<br><br>
force of 2.0 to 12.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of 2.0 to 10.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of 2.0 to 8.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at least 1.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at least 2.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at least 3.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at least 4.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at most 20.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at most 15.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at most 12.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at most 10.0 kN. Preferably, according to the invention, the pressing is carried out with a force of at most 8.0 kN.<br>
In connection with the present invention, the 1,6-GPS and the 1,1-GPM which are mixed with the isomalt are to be understood as such 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM which are not contained in the used isomalt prior to mixing. Thus, the 1,6-GPS and the 1,1-GPM which are mixed with the isomalt do not involve the 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM contained in the isomalt fraction. Thus, according to the invention, the 1,6-GPS and 1,1-GPM present in the form of isomalt are mixed with additional 1,6-GPS and/or additional 1,1-GPM.<br>
