				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a replaceable LED lamp. In particular, the present invention relates to replaceable LED lamps suitable for use as indicator/lamps, signaling, automotive indicators/lamps and domestic applications of LED such as for decoratve lamps, night lamps etc. Also, the replaceable LED lamps of the invention have applications as indicators and signals in various electrical and electronics devices, industries, power generation plants, steel plants, fertilizer plants, defense, railways and domestic uses.<br>
LED as is well known is a light emitting diode(LED) which requires to forward operating voltage and current. It is usually wired in series with current limiting resistor and/or capacitor to control the supply current.<br>
It is presently known to have LED lamps as indicators which comprise of polymeric or bakelite based holders which house the LED lamps and their operating circuitry of various specifications including, those involving capacitor/resistor and rectifier based circuitry. In particular, in such conventional LED units, the LED lamp and its operating circuitry is loosely inserted within said housing and at the front a filter means is releasably secured to the said holder.<br>
It is also known to use incandescent lamps as indicators instead of LEDs. However, such application of incandescent lamps requires use of expensive holders with the incandescent lamp replaceably connected to said holder.<br>
It is found that such conventional indicator/signalling means presently available as discussed above suffer from some inherent disadvantages/drawbacks in as far as its manufacture, application and use in various fields are concerned. In particular, some of the basic disadvantages/drawbacks associated with such known LED lamp include the following:<br>
1) In such known LED units when the holders house the LED lamps and operative<br>
circuitry, in the instance the LED lamp and/or any component of the circuit get<br>
damaged, the whole unit inclusive of the holder requires replacement which add to<br>
recurring cost and maintenance expenditure.<br>
2) Conventional replaceable incandescent lamp indicators suffer from inherent<br>
drawbacks including short life, higher power consumption, production of heat and<br>
1) <br>
2<br>
are also fragile requiring very careful handling to avoid breakage. Such lamps frequently require replacement due to damage and/or breakage which again add to the cost of use and maintenance of such known replaceable incandescent lamps and its operating units. Also, such conventional LED and incandescent lamps require special holder which require sophisticated machinery and technical expertise to manufacture and is also cost extensive to obtain.<br>
3) The conventional LED lamp units usually have a separate colour filter attached to<br>
the holder at the front thereof which apart from requiring additional expenses on<br>
provision of such separate filters are also not shock and vibration resistant and thus<br>
subject to breakage adding to additional cost on replacement and maintenance. Also<br>
such front colour filters which are not integral result in loss of effective luminance<br>
from the lamp units thereby further reducing effective luminance power of such LED<br>
lamps.<br>
4) The conventional filament incandescent lamp also require separate colour filter to<br>
provide for desired indicator colour unit and the problems of breakage and resultant<br>
cost burdened is also common problem for such conventional filament/incandescent<br>
lamp also.<br>
5) The conventional LED holders further have space constraint which pose problems in<br>
assembling of the unit with plurality of LED lamps which in turn affect the lumen<br>
output desired out of such units.<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide for replaceable indicator/signaling LED lamps which would avoid the above discussed problems of existing LED lamp units and incandescent lamps.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide for replaceable LED lamps which would be simple to manufacture and would be cost effective.<br>
