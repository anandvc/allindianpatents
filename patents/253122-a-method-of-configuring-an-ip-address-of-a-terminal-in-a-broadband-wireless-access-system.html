				<td>Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to broadband (wideband) wireless (radio) access<br>
systems, in particular, to a method of simplifying the IP address configuration<br>
(establishment) procedures when a mobile/fixed terminal in idle mode changes to<br>
receiving mode or when performing handover.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	In general, in a broadband wireless access system, an idle mode for a mobile (or<br>
fixed) terminal (e.g., mobile station, mobile subscriber station (MSS), user terminal,<br>
user equipment (UE), etc.) is supported in order to minimize power consumption. In<br>
idle mode, a 'paging zone' is defined as the entire region that is handled by a plurality<br>
of bases station called a 'paging group' and all base station included within the same<br>
paging zone have the same paging cycle value (Paging_Cycle) and paging offset value<br>
(Paging_Offset).<br>
[3]	The terminal may request to the base station for changing into idle mode, and the<br>
base station delivers its paging zone identification (Paging-group ID) and the paging<br>
cycle and paging offset associated thereto to the terminal to allow that terminal to<br>
change into idle mode state. During the idle mode, the terminal can determine whether<br>
to maintain or end its idle mode based upon the paging that is delivered in broadcast<br>
format from the base station at each paging period.<br>
[4]	Additionally, when there is traffic (e.g., data, packets, etc.) that needs to be<br>
delivered by the terminal in idle mode, the terminal may end its idle mode at any time.<br>
Also, when a terminal in idle mode does not receive paging within a set period of time<br>
due to reasons such as moving into another paging zone, losing synchronization, etc.,<br>
then the terminal ends its idle mode.<br>
[5]	When data traffic to be delivered to me terminal in idle mode is generated, the base<br>
station can make me terminal end its idle mode through paging. In such situations<br>
when traffic to be forwarded is generated for the terminal, the base station delivers an<br>
action code to enter network.<br>
[6]	In mis situation or when the terminal has data to be sent on the uplink, die terminal<br>
performs IP address configuration (establishment) procedures. If the network prefix<br>
used by the base station that received the paging did not change and remains the same,<br>
the above procedures could be omitted, but such omission is not possible because a<br>
procedure for performing network prefix comparison is not provided by the related art.<br><br>
[7]	The idle mode can be comprised of the following operations and steps.<br>
[8]	- start idle mode by mobile terminal<br>
[9]	- cell selection<br>
[10]	- synchronization of paging message broadcast time of terminal<br>
[11]	- terminal paging unavailable cycle<br>
[12]	- terminal paging listening period<br>
[13]	- base station paging broadcast message transmission period<br>
[14]	- base station broadcast message<br>
[15]	- end paging available mode<br>
[16]	Among these, the technique related to the present invention is the base station<br>
paging broadcast message.<br>
[17]	The base station paging broadcast message is a message sent via the base station or<br>
a different network element for informing a particular mobile terminal that currently<br>
delayed downlink traffic exists. This paging broadcast message must be transmitted<br>
through a broadcast connection identifier (CID) during a base station paging broadcast<br>
message transmission time period, and should be transmitted during the transmission<br>
time period regardless of the number of mobile terminals that require paging.<br>
[18]	The base station paging broadcast message should be able to include one or more<br>
paging group IDs mat indicate the logical classification of the base station that<br>
transmits. Regarding the base station paging broadcast message, the mobile terminals<br>
are distinguished by the mobile terminal MAC address hash, and a single base station<br>
paging broadcast message can include a plurality of MAC addresses.<br>
[ 19]	The base station paging broadcast message must transmit an action code with<br>
respect to each mobile terminal that is distinguished by mobile terminal MAC address<br>
hashes, and such action codes are as follows.<br>
[20]	- 00: no action required<br>
[21]	- 01: perform Ranging to configure location and acknowledge message<br>
[22]	-10: perform initial network entry<br>
[23]	-11: reserved<br>
[24]	Among the above action codes, the base station paging broadcast message that is<br>
transmitted when there is downlink data, transmits an action code '10' and the terminal<br>
performs network entry procedures based upon mis action code.<br>
[25]	Accordingly, in the related art, the mobile terminal must always re-configure<br>
(re-establish) its IP address when the mobile terminal in idle mode receives paging<br>
from the base station because there is downlink data to be received or when there is<br>
uplink data to be sent<br>
[26]-	Namely, when a mobile terminal operating in idle mode moves into a different base<br>
station region and receives from the base station a paging broadcast message indicating<br><br>
that currently set aside (delayed) downlink data exists, the mobile terminal may omit<br>
the IP address configuration (establishment) procedures if the IP Subnet, Prefix, and<br>
Access Router (NetID) used by the base station are the same as those previously used<br>
by the mobile terminal. Also, when the mobile terminal in idle mode performs reg-<br>
istration procedures with the base station because it has data to be sent on the uplink,<br>
the base station compares the previously received IP Subnet, Prefix, and Access Router<br>
(NetID) used by the mobile terminal with the IP Subnet, Prefix, and Access Router<br>
(NetID) that are can be used or are currently being used within die base station, and<br>
informs to the mobile station as to whether IP address re-configuration<br>
(re-establishment) is needed or not.<br>
[27]	However, because the related art does not provide the procedures that can compare<br>
the IP Subnet, Prefix, and Access Router (NetID), the mobile terminal had to perform<br>
IP address configuration (establishment) procedures each time the idle mode was<br>
ended when there was uplink or downlink data, thus causing the problems of un-<br>
necessary time delays.<br>
[28]	Meanwhile, the process for handover in a broadband wireless access system<br>
comprises a pre-processing procedure, a handover procedure, and a 'drops and<br>
corrupted HO attempts' procedure.<br>
[29]	1. Pre-processing procedures for handover<br>
[30]	As the pre-processing procedures for handover of IEEE 802.16e, a procedure of<br>
informing the mobile terminals by broadcasting from a base station, the information<br>
related to neighboring base stations (e.g., Network Topology Advertisement), a<br>
procedure of measuring the channel quality of neighboring base stations based upon<br>
such information (e.g„ MSS scanning of neighbor BS), and a procedure of selectively<br>
matching time differences and the like for the neighboring base station and initial<br>
terminal power value, as well as for synchronization (e.g., association procedures).<br>
[31]	* Network Topology Advertisement<br>
[32]	The base station informs all mobile stations within a cell about the information of<br>
neighboring base stations by transmitting information related to network constitution<br>
information in a broadcasting manner through a MOBJ^JBR-ADV MAC (Medium<br>
Access Control) message.<br>
[33]	* MSS scanning of neighbor BS<br>
[34]	As a mobile terminal must scan (search) neighboring base stations for handover, a<br>
scanning interval is requested to the base station through a MOB_SCN-REQ MAC<br>
message for scanning neighbor base stations, and the base station transmits a<br>
MOB_SCN-RSP MAC message in response to allocate an interval that allows the<br>
terminal to scan neighboring base stations. Also, the base station may directly transmit<br>
a MOB_SCN_RSP MAC message without any request of the mobile terminal (i.e., un-<br><br>
solicited request). At this time, the scanning interval and offset unit to start scanning<br>
that the base station allocates are all allocated in units of frames.<br>
[35]	* Association Procedure<br>
[36]	The association procedure is a procedure in which the terminal normally joins a cell<br>
by performing a ranging procedure with the base station. The associate procedure is<br>
performed when the terminal scans the base stations and selects a new base station. A<br>
RNG-REQ MAC message is transmitted by the terminal, and the base station transmits<br>
a RNG-RSP MAC message to set the power offset value, timing offset value, etc. to<br>
the appropriate values.<br>
[37]	Transmitting of the RNG-REQ MAC message is referred to as an initial ranging<br>
operation, and is one of the most basic operations of an IEEE 802.16 system by which<br>
the terminal performs a network entry process. The target base station that receives a<br>
new terminal through handover (HO), transmits the matters in association to the cell of<br>
the terminal to the serving base station that the terminal was previously a part of, and<br>
then stores the information related to the terminal.<br>
[38]	2. Handover (HO) Process<br>
[39]	Based upon the neighboring base station and channel'quality information obtained<br>
from the above handover pre-processing procedures, the terminal begins handover.<br>
[40]	* Cell Selection<br>
[41]	The cell selection operation is an operation of changing a cell in order to newly<br>
register with a base station that allows reception of a signal having a better Signal-<br>
to-Interference-Noise Ratio (SINR) than me SINR of the signal transmitted from the<br>
base station of a current cell before the terminal normally registers with the cell At this<br>
time, the base station has no way of knowing about any movement of the terminal<br>
because the terminal has not yet performed any registration procedures.<br>
[42]	* HO Initiation<br>
[43]	Handover initiation can be performed by either the base station (BS) or the mobile<br>
terminal (MSS: mobile subscriber station). Namely, when the base station requests<br>
handover, it transmits a MOB_BSHO-REQ MAC message, and when the mobile<br>
terminal requests handover, it transmits a MOB_MSSHO-REQ MAC message. If the<br>
terminal transmits a MOB_MSSHO-REQ MAC message, the SINR of the signals<br>
received from neighboring base stations is transmitted to the base station, and the<br>
candidate base stations that can be a target base station during handover are transmitted<br>
to the currendy serving base station.<br>
[44]	The base station receives a MOB_MSSHO-REQ MAC message from the terminal<br>
or before the base station itself transmits a MOB_MSSHO-REQ MAC message in<br>
order to handover the terminal, the handover of the terminal is allowed after checking<br>
the responses (ACK) from neighboring base stations for performing handover of the<br><br>
particular terminal. The terminal or base station that receives the<br>
MOB_BSHO/MSSHO-REQ message transmits a MOB_MSSHO/BSHO-RSP MAC<br>
message to inform about the target base station that will perform the handover.<br>
[45]	* HO Cancellation<br>
[46]	After the MOBJMSSHO/BSHO-REQ MAC message is transmitted to allow the<br>
terminal or base station to perform handover, the terminal may cancel the handover.<br>
Here, the terminal can set a particular field of the MOB_HO-IND MAC message (e.g.,<br>
HO_Type=01) and transmit such to the base station for canceling the handover that is<br>
currently being performed.<br>
[47]	* Termination with the Serving BS<br>
[48]	By transmitting a MOB_HO-IND MAC message to the serving base station, the<br>
terminal informs that handover has been properly completed and finishes the handover<br>
operation. Here, the terminal can set a particular field of the M0B_HO-IND MAC<br>
message (e.g., HO_Type=00) and transmit such to the serving base station to inform<br>
that handover has been properly completed. Upon receiving the MOB_HO-IND MAC<br>
message from the terminal, the base station terminates the MAC state machine, ARQ<br>
connection, and all connections related to data transmission that were allocated the<br>
terminal that has been handed over.<br>
[49]	* HO Rejection<br>
[50]	The terminal may reject the handover recommended by the base station, and does<br>
so by setting a particular field of the MOB_HO-IND MAC message (e.g.,<br>
HO_Type=10) and transmits to the base station. Upon receiving a rejection message<br>
from the terminal, the base station re-constitutes the target base stations and re-<br>
transmits a MOB_BSHO-RSP message to the terminal.<br>
[51]	3. Drops and Corrupted HO Attempts<br>
[52]	If the downlink data received from the base station cannot be reconstructed<br>
(recovered, decoded, etc.) or if a RNG-RSP MAC message (with respect to a RNG-<br>
REQ MAC message) transmitted to the base station after handover is not properly<br>
received and the limit on the number of times that the RNG-REQ MAC message can<br>
be transmitted to the base station is reached, the terminal terminates communication. In<br>
such case, the terminal re-performs the network entry procedures with the desired<br>
target base station to perform an operation for connection recovery.<br>
[53]	* Re-entry with the Target BS<br>
[54]	The terminal that performed handover performs a new network entry operation with<br>
the target base station, and also performs handover procedures for re-entry with<br>
neighboring base stations as well. However, from the point of view of the base station,<br>
the re-entry is performed in the same manner as a regular network entry procedure.<br>
[55]	* Synchronization with Downlink and Obtain Parameters<br><br>
[56]	The terminal that performed handover detects the downlink signal of the target base<br>
station to form synchronization with the base station, and receives a MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
MAC message transmitted by the base station to determine the conditions of<br>
neighboring base stations. Also, the terminal performs the same procedures as in a<br>
regular network entry procedure, namely, the operations to receive the DL_MAP and<br>
DCD message are performed.<br>
[57]	* Obtain Uplink Parameters<br>
[58]	The terminal that performed handover, after obtaining the downlink parameters as<br>
described above, receives uplink parameters through reception of a UL_MAP MAC<br>
message, a UCD message, etc.<br>
[59]	* Ranging and Uplink Parameters Adjustment<br>
[60]	The terminal that performed handover attempts to perform ranging with the new<br>
base station. This ranging operation is one of the most basic operations in a IEEE<br>
802.16 system, whereby a ranging operation of a competitive allocation method is<br>
performed through a ranging opportunity (i.e., an interval allowing transmission of a<br>
ranging message) that is allocated by the base station based upon the 48 bit length<br>
MAC address of the terminal itself. Through this ranging operation, the terminal<br>
receives a new basic ID and a primary management ID allocated from the target base<br>
station. This operation achieved as the terminal obtains the uplink parameters by<br>
receiving the Fast_UL_Ranging IE that is transmitted by being inserted into the<br>
UL_MAP MAC message transmitted by the base station.<br>
[61]	Here, the ranging opportunity received for the above ranging operation is performed<br>
in a contention-free manner, unlike the initial ranging operation performed for regular<br>
network entry.<br>
[62]	* MSS Re-authentication<br>
[63]	This is an authentication procedure for normal operation of the terminal, whereby<br>
an authentication procedure occurs by using a PKM (Private Key Management)<br>
protocol, while the existing security context performs the authentication procedure<br>
without any changes.<br>
[64]	* Re-register and Re-establish Provisioned Connections<br>
[65]	The base station is in a state by which the 48 bit MAC address if the terminal has<br>
already been received, and since the authentication procedure of the terminal was<br>
performed properly, me proper registration procedure of the terminal is performed. The<br>
terminal begins the registration process by transmitting a REG-REQ MAC message,<br>
and the base station transmits a REG-RSP MAC message to re-establish a provisioned<br>
connection of the terminal before handover, to allow proper IP service to be<br>
performed.<br><br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[66]	la general, IP re-configuration (re-establishment) is performed after the mobile<br>
terminal performs handover, and IP re-configuration (re-establishment) need not be<br>
performed if the IP subnet is the same. However, in the related art, this cannot be<br>
known and IP re-configuration (re-establishment) must be done each time the terminal<br>
moves. Namely, even if the previous IP address can be used without having to<br>
configure (establish) an IP address after the terminal performs handover (for example,<br>
when the IP subnet or foreign agent remain the same), IP address configuration<br>
(establishment) is always performed after the mobile terminal moves according to the<br>
related art<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[67]	The present invention provides a method of configuring (establishing) an IP address<br>
of a terminal that simplifies the IP address configuration (establishment) procedures<br>
when the terminal in idle mode changed into receiving mode or when handover is<br>
performed.<br>
[68]	Instead of having a mobile terminal always perform IP address re-configuration<br>
whenever it is associated with a new point of attachment (e.g., performing handover,<br>
changing from idle mode to receiving mode, etc.), it is determined if IP address re-<br>
configuration is actually necessary by considering whether the previous IP address<br>
may still be used or if a new IP address needs to be configured.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[81]	The preferred exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
explained. However, those skilled in the art would understand that the features of the<br>
present invention should not be limited to only the embodiments described herein.<br>
[82]	The present invention is related to the research and development being conducted<br>
by various IEEE working groups, such as IEEE 802.16, and thus the concepts and<br>
teachings involved therein are applicable to the features of the present invention. Ad-<br>
ditionally, as various efforts are being made to implement the interworking of different<br>
types of networks and communication technologies, such as achieving compatibility<br>
between IEEE networks and cellular networks (such as, a third generation (3G)<br>
networks), it can be clearly understood that the present invention may also have ap-<br>
plicability in achieving such compatibility.<br>
[83]	Considering the communication protocols related to wireless (radio) access<br>
systems, at the network layer, to allow proper data packet communication via the<br>
Internet, an Internet Protocol (IP) provides the necessary addressing and routing in-<br>
formation for the packets. Here, each device (e.g., user terminal, mobile handset,<br>
wireless connectivity device, etc.) connected via the Internet requires the configuration<br>
(establishment) of a unique IP address in order for that device to be properly identified<br>
and distinguished from other devices.<br>
[84]	The Internet Protocols referred to as IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6)<br>
have been developed. By employing 32-bit addresses, IPv4 has been found to have<br><br>
limitations because of the increasing popularity of Internet communications, whereby<br>
each device connected with the Internet needs its own unique IP address. As such, bee<br>
ause the availability of 32-bit addresses would soon be exhausted, an enhancement was<br>
developed, namely, IPv6, which employs 128-bit addresses.<br>
[85]	However, the fact that a user terminal may have mobility (e.g., mobile terminals)<br>
makes IP address configuration (establishment) more difficult For example, to support<br>
mobility, a user terminal may undergo handover, whereby the terminal being served by<br>
one point of attachment (e.g., base station) that covers a certain region, moves to a new<br>
location and needs to be served by a different point of attachment (e.g., base station)<br>
that covers that new location. In other words, the mobile station that is part of a first<br>
subnet (i.e., a portion of the network) moves into a second subnet (i.e., another portion<br>
of the network). Another example would be when a user terminal changes its state of<br>
operation into a receiving mode from an idle mode, which is an example of a power-<br>
saving operation mode that is important because a user terminal having mobility<br>
should conserve its limited battery power.<br>
[86]	In such handover or idle mode change situations described above, IP address con-<br>
figuration (establishment) must be performed at the appropriate time such that<br>
seamless data reception can be received by the user terminal.<br>
[87]	In the related art broadband wireless access systems, regarding the handover<br>
procedures, a so-called 'managed' mobile terminal performs IP address re-<br>
establishment (re-configuration) after a secondary management connection identifier<br>
(CID) is obtained upon completing handover such that IP communications can be<br>
resumed.<br>
[88]	When a mobile terminal that moves to a new point of attachment (base station)<br>
region is managed mobile terminal, IP address re-establishment is required regardless'<br>
of the subnet that can be allocated by a foreign agent or by a DHCP server connected<br>
with the new point of attachment (base station). Thus, a basis to be used for de-<br>
termining when IP address re-establishment should be performed is needed. In the<br>
related art, the determination at the IP layer cannot be known at the MAC layer, and<br>
thus the IP address re-establishment cannot be informed to the mobile terminal.<br>
[89]	Thus, in (he present invention, the point of attachment (base station) uses the IP<br>
address related information received via a backbone message (or another type of<br>
message), and provides a basis to allow the MAC layer to determine whether the<br>
mobile terminal should perform IP address re-establishment related procedures.<br>
[90]	As the MAC layer of the point of attachment (base station) can inform the mobile<br>
terminal as to whether IP address establishment is necessary, the handover procedures<br>
can be simplified and the time delay in resuming communications after handover can<br>
be minimized.<br><br>
[91]	One purpose of the present invention is to provide an IP address configuration<br>
(establishment) method for a terminal wherein the base station (point of attachment)<br>
determines the information related to IP address configuration (establishment) when<br>
the terminal changes from idle mode to receiving mode or when handover is<br>
performed, and informs this to the terminal.<br>
[92]	To achieve this purpose in a broadband wireless access system, in the IP address<br>
configuration (establishment) method according to the present invention, the base<br>
station (point of attachment) determines and informs the terminal about whether the IP<br>
address of the terminal should be re-configured (re-established) when the terminal<br>
changes from idle mode to receiving mode or when handover is performed<br>
[93]	Preferably, the base station is a target base station to which the terminal is<br>
attempting network entry to.<br>
[94]	Preferably, the matter of whether the IP address of the terminal should be re-<br>
configured (re-established) is delivered through a ranging response message or a reg-<br>
istration response message.<br>
[95]	Preferably, the base station respectively compares the IP Subnet, Prefix, and<br>
Access Router (NetID) previously used by me terminal with me IP Subnet, Prefix, and<br>
Access Router (NetID) that it may use or is currently using, in order to determine<br>
whether the IP address of the terminal should be re-configured (re-established).<br>
[96]	Preferably, if the network prefix ID (NetID) used by the terminal changes, the base<br>
station delivers the changed NetID to the terminal through a ranging response message<br>
or a registration response message.<br>
[97]	Preferably, the base station delivers whether the IP address should be re-configured<br>
(re-established) through a ranging response message or a registration response message<br>
only when the network prefix ID (NetID) has changed.<br>
[98]	The present invention proposes a scheme in which the DP address establishment<br>
(configuration) procedures can be simplified according to changes (NetID) in the IP<br>
Subnet, Prefix, Access Router, and Foreign Agent being used, when the mobile/fixed<br>
terminal changes from idle mode to receiving mode or when handover is performed.<br>
[99]	Namely, the present invention provides a method in which when me terminal<br>
receives a paging message from the base station (point of attachment) indicating that<br>
data to be transmitted on the downlink currently exists or when data to be transmitted<br>
on the uplink exists, the base station determines and informs the terminal as to whether<br>
IP address re-establishment (re-configuration) of the terminal is needed, and allowing<br>
the IP address re-configuration (re-establishment) procedures to be omitted ac-<br>
cordingly. Also, the present invention provides a method in which after the terminal<br>
moves during the handover process, the base station determines and informs the<br>
terminal as to whether IP address re-configuration (re-establishment) of the terminal is<br><br>
needed, and allowing the IP address re-configuration (re-establishment) procedures to<br>
be omitted accordingly.<br>
[100]	First, a method of configuring (establishing) an IP address of the terminal that<br>
changes from idle mode to receiving mode according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be explained.<br>
[101]	In the terminal IP address configuration (establishment) method according to the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, a registration response message (REG-RSP),<br>
a ranging response message (RNG-RSP), a paging broadcast backbone message, etc,<br>
are defined.<br>
[ 102]	The registration response message (REG-RSP) is a message that is transmitted by<br>
setting an IP re-configuration (re-establishment) required bit, when the ID related to th<br>
e terminal IP address received by the new base station (Target BS) from the previous<br>
base station (Serving BS) when the mobile terminal performs registration procedures<br>
after handover, and the ID that is currently being used (or can be used) are compared<br>
and found to be different<br>
[103]	The ranging response message (RNG-RSP) is a message that is transmitted by<br>
setting an IP re-configuration (re-establishment) required bit, when the ID related to<br>
the terminal IP address received by the new base station (Target BS) from the previous<br>
base station (Serving BS) when the mobile terminal performs ranging with the new<br>
base station after handover, and the ED that is currently being used (or can be used) are<br>
compared and found to be different<br>
[104]	Accordingly, the new base station (Target BS) informs whether the terminal IP<br>
address should be re-configured (re-established) through either the registration<br>
response message (REG-RSP) or the ranging response message (RNG-RSP).<br>
[ 105]	The paging broadcast backbone message is a message used when informing the<br>
other base stations within the paging zone about the fact that data traffic to be<br>
transmitted to the mobile terminal arrived at the base station to which the mobile<br>
terminal requested registration release for changing into idle mode, or used when in-<br>
formation about the terminals that changed into idle mode is to be commonly shared by<br>
the base stations within the same paging zone. Preferably, the paging broadcast<br>
backbone message is transmitted by including the network prefix id (NetID) that the<br>
mobile terminal had used.<br>
[106]	Figures 1 and 2 respectively show examples of the formats of the registration<br>
response message (REG-RSP) and the ranging response message (RNG-RSP).<br>
[107]	As shown in Figure 1, the registration response message (REG_RSP) indicates<br>
whether the terminal IP address should be re-configured (re-established) via bit #2. In<br>
particular, the registration response message (REG-RSP) can instruct the terminal to<br>
change its NetID, if the ID related to IP address of the terminal received by the new<br><br>
base station from the previous base station and the ID being currently used (or that can<br>
be used) are compared and found to be different. Preferably, even if bit #2 is not<br>
activated, if the NetID change indicator is set, then the terminal re-configures<br>
(re-establishes) its IP address.<br>
[108]	Also, referring to Figure 2, the ranging response message (RNG-RSP) indicates<br>
whether the terminal IP address should be re-configuration via bit #0, and the NetID<br>
change can be instructed to the terminal through a separate bit Similarly, even if bit #0<br>
is not activated, if the NetID change indicator is set, then the terminal re-configuration<br>
of its IP address.<br>
[109]	Figure 3 shows an example of how the matter of whether the IP address re-<br>
configuration should be made is informed through the registration procedures when a<br>
terminal in idle mode ends its idle mode because downlink (DL) traffic exists.<br>
[110]	Referring to Figure 3, the mobile terminal performs registration release request/<br>
response (DREG_REQ/DREG_RSP) with the base station in order to enter idle mode.<br>
At this time, the base station broadcasts the information about the terminal that entered<br>
idle mode to all base stations within the same paging zone (e.g., through use of a<br>
paging-announce message). Through this, the procedures that the terminal must<br>
perform should be informed to the base stations at each paging cycle. To do so, the<br>
paging broadcast backbone message may be used. The MAC address of the terminal<br>
and the Network Prefix ID (NetID) corresponding to the IP address used by the mobile<br>
terminal are both included in the paging broadcast backbone message and transmitted.<br>
[111]	Thereafter, for a mobile terminal in idle mode, when data traffic (uplink traffic)<br>
that needs to be transmitted is generated or when data traffic (downlink traffic) that<br>
needs to be received is generated, the mobile terminal ends its idle mode and performs<br>
network entry.<br>
[112]	The base station (BS#3), with which the mobile station performs network entry<br>
procedures, compares the network prefix ID (NetID) received from the base station<br>
(BS#1) that had its registration released by the mobile terminal and the network prefix<br>
ID (NetID) that it currently can use, and then the matter of whether IP address re-<br>
configuration (re-establishment) would be needed or not is informed to the mobile<br>
terminal during the ranging procedures (via a RNG-RSP message) or during the reg-<br>
istration procedures (via a REG-RSP message).<br>
[113]	Accordingly, the mobile terminal determines whether to re-configure (re-establish)<br>
its IP address based upon the RNG-RSP or REG-RSP message, and if not required, the<br>
IP address re-configuration (re-establishment) procedures may be omitted, which<br>
allows communications to be resumed more quickly.<br>
[114]	Also, when an ID related to an IP address is changed for handover with another<br>
type of network, this can be informed by the base station to the mobile station by<br><br>
including such in a ranging or registration response message.<br>
[115]	Thus, the methods that can be performed by the base station to inform the mobile<br>
station about whether IP address re-configuration (re-establishment) would be needed<br>
can be summarized as follows.<br>
[116]	1. Method of mforming by setting a configuration bit in the registration response<br>
message.<br>
[117]	2. Method of informing by setting a configuration bit in the ranging response<br>
message.<br>
[118]	For 1 or 2 above, if the network prefix ID (NetID) changes, this changed ID must<br>
be informed to the terminal separately by using the ranging response message and the<br>
registration response message.<br>
[119]	3. Only in the case where the network prefix ID (NetID) changes, the mobile<br>
terminal is informed through the ranging response message or the registration response<br>
message.<br>
[120]	Figure 4 shows an example of informing whether or not the IP address re-<br>
configuration (re-establishment) is needed through a ranging procedure when the<br>
terminal ends its idle mode because downlink traffic exists.<br>
[121]	Figure 5 also shows an example of informing whether or not the IP address re-<br>
configuration (re-establishment) is needed through a ranging procedure when the<br>
terminal ends its idle mode because downlink traffic exists.<br>
 [122]	Figure 6 shows an example of informing whether or not the IP address re-<br>
configuration (re-establishment) is needed through a registration procedure when the<br>
terminal ends its idle mode because uplink traffic exists.<br>
[ 123]	Hereafter, a method of configuring (establishing) an IP address of the terminal<br>
during handover according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained.<br>
[124]	In the terminal IP address configuration (establishment) method according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention, a registration response message<br>
(REG-RSP), a ranging response message (RNG-RSP), a handover confirmation<br>
message (HO-confirm), etc. are defined.<br>
[125]	The registration response message (REG-RSP) is a message that is transmitted by<br>
setting an IP re-configuration (re-establishment) required bit, when the ID related to<br>
the terminal IP address received by the new base station (Target BS) from the previous<br>
base station (Serving BS) when the mobile terminal performs registration procedures<br>
after handover, and the ID that is currently being used (or can be used) are compared<br>
and found to be different.<br>
[126]	The ranging response message (RNG-RSP) is a message that is transmitted by<br>
setting an IP re-configuration (re-establishment) required bit, when the ID related to<br><br>
the terminal IP address received by the new base station (Target BS) from the previous<br>
base station (Serving BS) when the mobile terminal performs ranging with the new<br>
base station after handover, and the ID that is currently being used (or can be used) are<br>
compared and found to be different<br>
[127]	Also, the handover confirmation message is a message that allows delivery through<br>
the backbone of an IP address related message of the mobile terminal that will move<br>
from a previous base station to a new base station when the mobile terminal performs<br>
handover. Accordingly, the new base station (Target BS) can determine whether the IP<br>
address of the mobile terminal should be re-configured (re-established) through the<br>
above-described messages.<br>
[128]	The formats of the registration response message (REG-RSP) and the ranging<br>
response message (RNG-RSP) are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively, while the<br>
format of the handover confirmation message is shown in Figure 7.<br>
[129]	In general, there are two types of handover; a handover started by the mobile<br>
terminal and a handover determined by the network In either case, when handover is<br>
performed, a handover confirmation message (HO-confirm) is delivered over the<br>
backbone from the previous base station (Serving BS) to a new base station (Target<br>
BS). When the handover confirmation message (HO-confirm) having the IP address of<br>
the terminal that is moving and its related ID (NetID=xxx) is delivered, the new base<br>
station uses this for comparison with the IP address related ID (NetID) that is uses and<br>
can inform the comparison result to the terminal after handover is completed when the<br>
ranging or registration procedure is performed,<br>
[130]	Thus, based upon the above results, the terminal can know whether the IP address<br>
should be re-configured (re-established) or whether the previously used IP address can<br>
be used. By employing the method of the present invention, the need for the terminal<br>
to re-configure (re-establish) its IP address during handover can be reduced for<br>
situations such as when the previous base station and the new base station have the<br>
same IP subnet, when the foreign agent (FA) is the same, etc., to thus nunimize the<br>
delays caused each time (he IP address is configured (established).<br>
[131]	Accordingly, in the terminal IP address configuration method according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention, there are three methods by which the<br>
base station can inform the mobile terminal about whether the IP address should be re-<br>
configured (re-established), which are the same as those of the first embodiment.<br>
[132]	Figure 8 shows an example of the operation in informing the terminal about<br>
whether the IP address should be re-configured (re-established) through (he ranging<br>
procedures during handover.<br>
[133]	Figure 9 shows an example of the operation in informing the terminal about<br>
whether the IP address should be re-configured (re-established) through the registration<br><br>
procedures during handover.<br>
[134]	It can be said that the present invention relates to the minimization of IP con-<br>
nectivity establishment procedures. IEEE 802.16 uses DHCP (Dynamic Host Con-<br>
figuration Protocol) and Mobile IP in order to allocate IP addresses to MSSs (Mobile<br>
Subscriber Stations), and after the MSS handover to the target BS (base station), re-<br>
establishment of IP connectivity is required. However, in case the same subnet is used<br>
in the target BS or the same Foreign Agent is connected in the new BS, the re-<br>
establishment of IP connectivity procedure can be skipped and the MSS can use the<br>
same IP address. Therefore, a mechanism to determine the subnet change or Foreign<br>
Agent change for a moving MSS is required. When the MSS moves to a new BS, to<br>
decide the MSS's subnet change or Foreign Agent change, the new BS can provide the<br>
MSS with an instruction of subnet change provided through a backbone message.<br>
Here, the network ID can represent a Subnet Prefix, an Access Router, or a Foreign<br>
Agent One BS can have more than one NetID depending upon the network con-<br>
figuration.<br>
[135]	The current IEEE 802.16 does not provide the MSS with an instruction for IP re-<br>
establishment However, the present inventors propose a possible solution for the MSS<br>
to make a decision as to whether it needs to re-establish IP connectivity. By giving the<br>
MSS's IP related information to the target BS over a backbone, the target BS can<br>
provide a moving MSS with an instruction of IP-establishment<br>
[136]	In the related art, after MSS handover, a new IP allocation procedure is required<br>
regardless of subnet change. However, if the network subnet is not changed in the new<br>
BS, the MSS can use the old IP address which was used in the previous BS. Namely, in<br>
the DHCP case, if the network subnet is not changed in the new BS, the MSS can use<br>
the old IP address which was used in the previous BS. In the Mobile IPv4 case, when a<br>
MSS moves to a new BS, it takes some time for the MSS to re-establish IP con-<br>
nectivity using Mobile IPv4 However, if the same Foreign Agent is connected to the<br>
new BS, the MSS can skip the mobile IP procedure to reduce delay.<br>
[137]	To do so, the MSS needs information to decide whether the subnet or Foreign<br>
Agent is different from the previous BS. The information for subnet change decision is<br>
different depending upon the method for allocation the IP address. Two IP address<br>
allocating methods can be defined. One is using DHCP, and the other is using Mobile<br>
IPv4. Since DHCP messages and Mobile IPv4 messages are flowing on the secondary<br>
management connection, the BSs can monitor and store the IP related information.<br>
When an MSS is moving to a new BS, the old BS sends stored information (e.g., send<br>
MSS's NetID through a backbone) to the new BS, which then compares the received<br>
information with its own stored information (e.g., NetID) to make a decision of subnet<br>
change. The new BS provides a decision of subnet change in REG-RSP to the MSS<br><br>
after MSS's successful handover. For example, if one of the NetlDs in the new BS is<br>
the same as the received NetID from the previous BS, the new BS instructs the MSS<br>
with IP re-establishment is not required in a "Method for allocating IP address TLV of<br>
REG-RSP. If me NetID either in the Serving BS or the Target BS or both do not exist,<br>
the target BS should instruct to the MSS to re-establish IP connectivity.<br>
[138]	The procedures of how a subnet change can be decided for the DHCP case and for<br>
the Mobile IP case will be described hereafter.<br>
[139]	Figures 10,11,12 and 13 show examples of the DHCP case, whereby, Figures 10<br>
and 11 show when the DHCP server exists on the same network with the MSS, while<br>
Figures 12 and 13 shown when the DCHP server exists on a different network with the<br>
MSS. Figure 10 shows a DHCP message broadcast by the MSS, and Figure 11 shows a<br>
DHCP message sent by the DHCP server in response to the message from the MSS.<br>
Figure 12 shows a DHCP message forwarded from a MSS to a DHCP server by a relay<br>
agent in the router, while Figure 13 shows a response from the DHCP server forwarded<br>
by the relay agent in the router to the MSS.<br>
[140]	Referring to Figures 10 through 13, the relay agent IP address and server identifier<br>
in the DHCP response from the server can be used to decide whether a subnet is<br>
changed. Here, 'giaddr* refers to a relay agent IP address, and 'server identifier" is used<br>
to identify a DHCP server in a DHCP message and as a destination address from<br>
clients to servers.<br>
[141]	In the Mobile IPv4 case, the MSSs determine their movement by either using a<br>
lifetime field within the ICMP Router Advertisement [IETF RFC 1256] portion of an<br>
Agent Advertisement [IETF RFC 3220] or by using Network-Prefixes [IETF RFC<br>
3220]. The Router Address with prefix-length extension can identify a network-prefix.<br>
However, the prefix-length is an optional parameter, and when me prefix-length is not<br>
present, this information should not be used to decide the network-prefixes. Figure 14<br>
shows an example of an agent advertisement message.<br>
[142]	In the DHCP case, the BS listens to the DHCP offer message from the DHCP<br>
server to the MSSs on the secondary management connection and stored the 'giaddr'<br>
and 'server identifier'. In the Mobile IP case, the BS listens to the periodic Agent Ad-<br>
vertisement from the Foreign Agent and stores me Router Address in an ICMP Router<br>
Advertisement portion and a prefix-length extension in the Prefix-Length Extension of<br>
an Agent Advertisement<br>
[143]	By providing information to a target BS when MSS moves to a new BS, the target<br>
BS can determine whether the MSS's subnet has changed or not. The target BS tells the<br>
MSS whether it has to re-establish IP connectivity or not in the registration response<br>
(RSG-RSP) message.<br>
[144]	Accordingly, the present invention adds a mechanism for the BS to monitor the<br><br>
DHCP related and Mobile IP related information. Also, Type-Length-Value (TLV)<br>
parameters are added into the REG-RSP message, which is used to instruct the MSS<br>
whether it should perform an IP address re-establishment procedure.<br>
[145]	For mobile networks, the target BS may include the IP Address Change In-<br>
formation TLV in the REG-RSP message for MSS handover. The TLV specifies<br>
whether MSS has to re-establish IP connectivity or not based on the received in-<br>
formation from the old BS over a backbone. If the target BS cannot make a decision,<br>
the value should be set to 1.<br>
[146]	For a managed MSS, there is the possibility that entry at the new BS necessitates<br>
Layer 3 protocol exchanges in order to retain IP connectivity. Such an MSS should<br>
take appropriate steps to detect and respond to the change of BS (e.g., by performing<br>
Mobile IPv4 movement detection and re-registration, or Mobile IPv4 Binding Update).<br>
In order for the MSS to facilitate an IP connectivity retainment, the new BS may<br>
provide the MSS with an instruction of IP address change. The new BS's DP address<br>
change instruction is made based on the information from the old BS over a backbone.<br>
This information is stored by monitoring the MSS's IP connectivity establishment<br>
using DHCP and listening to an Agent Advertisement from the Foreign Agent on the<br>
secondary management connection.<br>
[147]	The following Table 1 shows an example of IP address establishment information.<br>
[148] <br>
[149]	The following Table 2 shows an example of TLV values that may appear in the IP<br>
address establishment information TLV.<br>
[150] <br>
[151]	The following Table 3 shows an example of TLV values that may appear in the IP<br>
address establishment information TLV.<br>
[152]	[Table 3]<br><br><br>
[153]	The following Table 4 shows an example of an IP Address Change Information.<br>
This field indicates whether or not the MSS needs to re-establish an IP address after<br>
handover. A bit value of '0' indicates that such is not required, while T indicates it is<br>
required.<br>
[154] <br>
[ 155]	The following Table 5 shows an example of the format of a Handover Comfirm<br>
Message.<br>
 [156] <br><br>
[157]	Also, the present invention proposes to modify the "method for allocating IP<br>
address TLV in the REG-RSP messages, which arc used to instruct the MSS as to<br>
whether it should perform IP address re-establishment procedures, which is achieved<br>
by adding 'NetID' and 'HO-Confirm and Paging-announce' backbone messages.<br>
[158]	Regarding the "Method for allocating IP address,' for establishing IP connectivity,<br>
the BS may include the method for allocating IP address TLV in the REG-RSP for the<br>
SS's or MSS's IP connectivity establishment. The TLV also specifies whether the MSS<br>
has to re-establish IP connectivity or not when the MSS moves to the new BS. The IP<br>
re-establishment required bit is set based on the comparison with the received NetID<br>
from the old BS over a backbone. If the target BS cannot make a decision, the value<br>
should be set as '1' (IP re-establishment required).<br>
[159]	The following Tables 6 and 7 show examples of the Method for allocating IP<br>
address, Table 8 shows an example of a HO-Confirm Message format, and Table 9<br>
shows an example of a Paging-announce message.<br>
[160]-----<br>
[161]<br>
[162] <br><br>
[163] <br>
[164]	Regarding the effects of the present invention, when a mobile terminal in idle mode<br>
performs network entry procedures, the bases station (point of attachment) that<br>
performed the registration release procedures of the mobile terminal delivers the<br>
network prefix related information (e.g, NetID, Router Advertisement, Agent Ad-<br>
vertisement) of the mobile terminal to another base station (point of attachment) within<br><br>
the same paging zone, and the base station performing the network entry compares the<br>
above network prefix related information (e.g, NetID) with the network prefix related<br>
information (e.g, NetID) that it is using, to inform whether IP address re-configuration<br>
(re-establishment) of me mobile station would be needed. Thus, by using the present<br>
invention, when the network prefix related information (e.g, NetID) of a terminal is<br>
changed, this changed network prefix related information (e.g, NetID) is informed to<br>
the terminal to allow it to be used when performing handover with a different network<br>
other that a IEEE 802.16 network.<br>
[165]	Also, in the present invention, when the mobile terminal performs IP address con-<br>
figuration (establishment) procedures after handover, if the subnet used among two<br>
base stations are the same or if the same foreign agent is used, the previous base station<br>
delivers the network prefix related information (e.g, NetID, router advertisement,<br>
Agent Advertisement) to the new base station, the new base station compares the<br>
delivered network prefix related information (e.g, NetID) with the network prefix<br>
related information (e.g, NetID) that it can or is currently using, and informs the<br>
mobile station as to whether IP address re-configuration is needed or not<br>
[166]	Accordingly, the present invention has the effect of simplifying the IP address con-<br>
figuration (establishment) procedures when the terminal changes from idle mode to<br>
receiving mode or when handover is performed, and can thus minimize the time delay<br>
caused by IP address re-configuration (re-establishment) of the related art<br>
[167]	As the present invention has been described above with respect to wireless access<br>
technologies, it can be clearly understood that various types of wireless access<br>
technologies currently under development (such as WiMax, WiBro, Wi-Fi, etc.) can<br>
also benefit from the features and teachings of the present invention, which are.<br>
applicable because of the similarities involved in wireless communications involving<br>
user terminal mobility, handovers and idle mode operations.<br>

person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to<br>
these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic<br>
principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Thus, the present<br>

2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the paging broadcast backbone<br>
message includes a medium access control address and a network prefix ID of the<br>
terminal.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the second base station informs<br>
the mobile station of a changed network prefix ID when the network prefix ID used<br>
by the terminal changes, through the registration response message.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the matter of whether or not the<br>
IP address should be re-configured is delivered the registration response message<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A METHOD OF CONFIGURING AN IP ADDRESS OF A TERMINAL<br>
IN A BROADBAND WTRELESS ACCESS SYSTEM<br>
This invention is a method for configuring an IP address of fixed/mobile station in a<br>
broadband wireless access system. A method of configuring an IP address of a terminal in a<br>
broadband wireless access system is disclosed. The base station determines whether the<br>
mobile station that changes from idle mode to receiving mode or performs handover needs to<br>
re-configure its IP address, and informs this to the mobile station. So, IP address<br>
configuration procedures are simplified between the base station and the mobile station.</td>
