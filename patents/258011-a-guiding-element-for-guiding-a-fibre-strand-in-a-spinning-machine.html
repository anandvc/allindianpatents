'This application is a divisional application based on application no. 889/CHENP/2005 <br>
The invention relates to a spinning machine according to the preamble of the independent claim, and it is further proposed for use in compacting spinning machines according to claim 4. These spinning machines either have a drafting arrangement with a special delivery roller which is connected to a suction device or a compacting device operating at vacuum is connected to a conventional two-stage drafting arrangement comprising three pairs of cylinders. Compaction takes place on an air-permeable compacting element which is moved forward with the sliver and is exposed to vacuum from inside, the compaction being brought about by the suction air flowing transversely towards the sliver.<br>
As new fields of application especially of compacting spinning machines are being opened up, there is a need to control the sliver before compacting on its path through the drafting arrangement and if necessary, to the compacting device as completely as possible.<br>
According to the invention, a special guide is provided for this purpose in the preferential draft of the drafting arrangement and/or before reaching the compacting device, which guide allows the drafted fibres to drift apart less than in conventional drafting arrangements without forcing substantial changes in direction on the individual fibres. In one embodiment, this is achieved by a deflecting element whose surface is at least coated by a portion of the fibres so that all the fibres of one sliver are deflected in the same way and/or the same direction. This is preferably achieved by a prismatic deflecting element - rod-shaped having substantially union cross-sections, which is arranged transversely to the flow direction of the fibre stream and is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the drafting cylinder. This guide element can be arranged directly before the sliver is wound on a compacting element. The change in direction of the sliver by the guide element is preferably 1.5 to 5°.<br><br>
The spinning machine according to the invention in the application in a mushy-cylinder drafting arrangement, comprising at least three pairs of distorting rollers and double aprons on one of the pairs of rollers, wherein for guiding a sliver by means of one of the aprons as close as possible to a delivery cylinder a cage is directed towards a pair of delivery cylinders, which cage has the apron looped around it, characterised by an additional rod-shaped guide either for the sliver or for the apron, which guide is arranged between the apron and the delivery cylinder.<br>
The guide can be curved concavely towards the delivery cylinder and convexly towards the sliver.<br>
In a second embodiment, the guide can be arranged between two top rollers towards the apron such that said apron experiences a concave deflection by the guide when seen from outside.<br>
The additional guide for the sliver can be arranged in the direction of transport of the sliver in one or after one drafting zone and before one compacting zone, especially before the sliver is wound on a compacting element of the compacting device.<br>
The invention is explained in detail subsequently in various exemplary embodiments with reference to the drawings. In the figures:<br>
Figure 1        and Figure 5 are respectively a cross-section and a side view of a<br>
conventional two-stage drafting arrangement in which the guide element is integrated.<br>
Figure 2        is a section from Figure 1, showing the important elements in the vicinity of the guide element.<br>
Figure 2a      shows the guide element with the sliver.<br>
Figure 3        shows the fixing of the guide on elements of the drafting arrangement.<br><br>
Figure 4        is another exemplary embodiment for a drafting arrangement with a compacting device, the latter being positioned after the drafting arrangement.<br>
Figure 6        is a guide element on an apron which makes it possible to achieve a longer guidance of the sliver through the apron.<br>
Figure 7        shows various possibilities for fixing the guide.<br>
The spinning machine Is fitted with a compacting device 1 which is connected to a drafting arrangement 1a of the spinning machine and Is characterised by an additional guide 34 for the sliver which is arranged in the direction of transport of the sliver after a drafting zone 4, 5 and before a compacting zone, especially before the sliver 11 is wound on a compacting element 19 of the compacting device.<br>
Said machine can be ftjrther characterised in<br>
that the guide 34 is arranged In the main drafting zone of a multi-stage drafting arrangement before the delivery cylinder 2,<br>
that the guide element 34 of the guide is a prismatic rod arranged in the longitudinal direction of the drafting cylinder, having a cross-section rounded on the functional side,<br>
that the guide element 34 is arranged so that it is passed through a connecting line or tangent to a gripping gap 23 between a delivery cylinder 2 and a top roller 2' pressed against said cylinder and the delivery gripping point between a top apron 5 and bottom apron 4 of the drafting arrangement la,<br>
that the sliver 11 or apron 5 is deflected by a few degrees, especially 1.5...6°,<br><br>
that the guide sits directly in front of the gripping gap 23 between the delivery cylinder 2 and a third top roller 2' of the drafting arrangement pressed against said cylinder,<br>
that if necessary, the delivery cylinder 2 of the drafting arrangement la is embodied as a compacting element 19 of a compacting device 1 with an air-permeable cylindrical surface,<br>
that aerodynamic effects can be triggered on the sliver 11 in a compaction zone 13 by a vacuum system 15,<br>
that the guide element 34 is affixed by means of retaining elements 340 to retaining parts for aprons, especially a cage 30 for an apron 4, 5 of the drafting arrangement la,<br>
that leaf springs are attached at the ends of a guide element 34, with a snap connection at the ends of a cage 30 for an apron 5 of the drafting arrangement<br>
1a,<br>
that a guide 34 for a sliver 11 sits on one edge of the cage 30 at a spacer 32 with a deflecting element 33 on one edge of a cage 30 for a top apron 5 of the drafting arrangement 1a,<br>
that a guide 34 is provided before the delivery cylinder 2 of the drafting arrangement la and a further guide 34' is provided after the delivery cylinder 2 and before a compacting device 1 with a compacting element 19, considered in each case in the direction of transport of a sliver 11 through the drafting arrangement la,<br>
wherein the afore-mentioned features can be applied singly or cumulatively.<br><br>
The drafting arrangement la comprising the compacting device 1 as shown in Figure 1 transports a sliver 11 over a feed cylinder 42 with a first top roller 42' pressed against said cylinder through a preliminary drafting zone to a middle cylinder 3 with a second top roller 3'. The middle cylinder 3 has a bottom apron 4 looped around it, which, driven by the middle cylinder, passes over a bridge 40. The top roller 3' with a top apron 5 and a cage 30 is pressed against the bottom apron 4 by means of a loading device 10 as shown in Figure 4, The top apron 5 is driven in contact with said bottom apron 3 by said bottom apron, wherein the fibres of the sliver 11 brought from the preliminary drafting zone between the feed cylinder 42 and middle cylinder 3 are retained in the main drafting zone against the tension of the delivery cylinder 2. In this exemplary embodiment the delivery cylinder 2 is embodied as a compacting element 19, i.e. as a perforated drum with internal suction. The top apron 5 on the one hand loops around the second top roller 3', and on ttie other hand around a spacer 32 which sits on the cage 30. A guide element 34 Is arranged between the delivery position of the sliver 11 from the bottom apron 4 or lop apron 3 and the delivery cylinder 2 with the third top roller 2', which slightly deflects the sliver 11 as shown in Figure 1 whereby taut guidance of the fibres of the sliver 11 is achieved and in particular shorter fibres are prevented from becoming detached from the sliver. A round bar especially having a diameter between 3 and 6 mm is preferably used as the guide element 34. The guide element 34 is arranged as close as possible to the surface of the delivery cylinder 2 or the compacting element 19, with a distance of less than 1 mm. After being deflected by the guide element 34 by a few degrees, the sliver is wound onto the surface of the compacting element 19, the looping path between the gripping position of the third top roller 2' and the fourth top roller 1' lying on the compacting element 19. A screen 19' over the compacting element 19 ensures that the incoming suction air is guided as parallel as possible to the axis of the delivery cylinder 2. The sliver is then preferably twisted by means of a ring spinning device 40 and wound onto a yarn bobbin.<br>
Figures 2 and 2a show enlarged sections of the device in the vicinity of the guide 34 where the sliver 11 is deflected by the angle a = 1.5...6°. Yarns can be spun in counts of Ne 3 to 100, preferably 3...50, especially 3 to 30 with preferably a single adjustment of<br><br>
the guide element of the guide 34. The feed can consist of all known spinnable fibre materials, also having a short-fibre fraction, especially carded cotton, also MMF, PES and blends. Good yarn qualities are achieved thanks to the guide 34. The reference numbers in Figures 2 and 2a are similar to those in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows two embodiments for fixing the guide 34 in the drafting arrangement. The cage 30 for guiding the top apron 5 is mounted fixedly but pivotaily with the second top roller 3' on the afore-mentioned loading device 10. In the first exemplary embodiment of the guide element of the guide 34, this extends over the entire length of a section of the cage 30 in Figure 3. The ends of the guide element 34 are held by retaining elements 340, 340'. The retaining elements 340 are attached fixedly at the ends of the cage 30, for example, using fixing elements 342 in the form of pins or screws. The retaining elements 340 can be made of spring steel, as leaf springs for example. They can be snapped by means of fixing pins 342 laterally into holes in the ends of the cage when the fixing elements 342 are aligned.<br>
According to a second exemplary embodiment of the guide 34 in the right-hand part of Figure 3, a comparatively short guide element 34 is positioned on the right longitudinal edge of the cage 30 at a spacer 32 by means of two retaining elements 340, 340' having gliders 342 at their ends. The gliders 342 in this case sit directly next to the gliders 320 of the spacer 32. The spacer is used to guide the top apron 5, this being deflected by the deflecting element 33 between the gliders 320. The gliders 342 can be executed like the gliders 320 of the spacer, shown in perspective view, with a larger distance between the gliders 342 than between the gliders 320. A retaining element 340 sits with the glider 342 next to the spacer 32 on the cage 30 as shown in Figure 3. Next to the cage 30, the spacer 32 is shown In perspective view and the short guide element 34 with the retaining elements 340 is shown in perspective/schematic view. As has already been mentioned, the guide element of the guide 34 is a preferably circular-cylindrical prismatic element. The guide 34 can also be affixed directly on the deflecting element 33.<br><br>
A further exemplary embodiment of a drafting arrangement vtfith a compacting device is shown in Figure 4. Of the drafting arrangement la, only the middle cylinder 3 and the delivery cylinder 2 with top rollers 3' (second top roller) and 2' (third top roller) pressed by means of the loading device 10 are shown. Located between the third top roller 2' and the fourth top roller 1' is a further roller 27 which is used to drive the fourth top roller Vby the third top roller 2'. In contrast to the arrangement in Figure 1, the delivery cylinder 2 is not executed as a compacting element, this is located adjacent on the left where a compacting element 19 in the form of an air-permeable apron is looped around the vacuum system 15. The compacting element 19 is moved forwards by the fourth top roller 1' with the sliver 11 or the yarn 25 along ttie compacting zone 13. The compaction of the sliver 11 in the compacting zone 13 takes place along a suction slit 17 through which air is sucked into the vacuum system 15. The axes 8 and 21 of the third top roller 2' or the fourth top roller 21 are held by the loading device 10. The sliver 11 is guided through a top apron 5 on the second top roller 3' and a bottom apron 4 on the middle cylinder 3 in the main drafting zone of the drafting arrangement, a guide 34 being arranged in a known fashion between the aprons 4 and 5, which deflects the sliver by a very small angle between 1.5 and 6°. The guide element 34 can be fixed to a cage 5' of the top apron 5 as is described in connection with Figure 3. The sliver 11 can be supported by a further guide element 34" from the gripping gap 23 between the delivery cylinder 2 and the third top roller 2' which is pressed thereagainst, until it reaches the compacting zone 13, This guide element can be constructed as a circular-cylindrical bar, like the guide element 34 described for example or, as shown by the dashed line, as a flat, more or less plane guide section which extends at least in the area of the sliver 11 along the spinning machine. As has already been described above, the first guide element 34 improves the cohesion of the fibres in the main drafting zone of the drafting arrangement between middle cylinder 3 and delivery cylinder 2 v^hereas the second guide element 34' so to speak serves as a guide table for the sliver between the delivery cylinder 2 and compacting element 19. The second gripping gap 24 between the compacting device 1 and the fourth top roller 1' delimits the twist in the yam 25 which originates from the spinning device positioned subsequently. The guide 34 should be arranged so that a connecting line between the gripping gap 23 of the pair of delivery<br><br>
cylinders 2, 2' and the delivery-side gripping point of the pair of aprons 4, 5 passes partly through the guide element 34,<br>
The surface condition of the deflection or guidance should be selected according to the desired effect or raw material. The deflection can be mounted fixedly or rotafably. The guide element 34 can also be affixed to the deflecting bridge 40.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the guide 34 can be curved concavely towards the delivery cylinder 2, 2' and convexly towards the sliver 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the guide 34 can be an'anged between two top rollers 2', 3' with respect to the apron 5 so that this undergoes a concave deflection by the guide 34 when viewed from outside, it is thereby possible to bring the apron closer to the top roller 2' whereby the sliver 11 is guided if not additionally, thus over a longer section.<br>
According to Figs. 2 and 4, the additional guide 34 for the sliver is arranged in the direction of transport of the sliver in or after a drafting zone 4, 5 and before a compacting zone, especially before the sliver 11 is wound on the compacting element 19 of the compacting device.<br>
According to Fig. 7, the guide 34 can be affixed on axles of top rollers 2', 2' using retaining elements 340a and 340c or on a loading arm 344.<br><br>
