Shading process<br>
The present invention relates to a shading process, to shading compositions, to new compounds used in these shading compositions as well as to the production of these new compounds.<br>
A frequently employed method in bleaching and whitening is to use violet or blue dyes concurrently in order to improve the bleaching and whitening effect. If such a dye is used in conjunction with a fluorescent whitening agent, this can serve two different purposes. On one hand, it is possible to try to achieve an increase in the degree of whiteness by compensating for the yellow of the fabric, in which case the white shade produced by the fluorescent whitening agent on the fabric is largely retained. On the other hand, the object can be to effect with the dye in question a change in the shade of the white effect produced by the fluorescent whitening agent on the fabric, in which case too an attempt is made additionally to achieve an increase in the degree of whiteness. It is thus possible to adjust the desired shade of the white effect.<br>
Shading processes of materials such as paper and textile fabrics are known from e.g. DE 3125495.<br>
These disclosed shading processes use a mixture of a photocatalyst and a dyestuff. These disclosed mixtures of photocatalyst and dyestuff are not suitable for a regular use, such as in detergent or softener formulations, because the dyestuffs do accumulate with every use and after a few uses the fabrics are colored. The shading compounds as used in the present invention do not (or only very slightly) color the textile fiber material, even if the textile fiber material is treated repeatedly with the present inventive shading compostions.<br>
Additionally, the use of a mixture of two components always requires the proper ratio of the two components.<br>
Furthermore, the new shading process using compounds, wherein at least one dyestuff is attached through a covalent bonding to the phthalocyanine has also an improved exhaustion onto the fabrics, an improved shade substantivity on fabrics and an improved shade consistency on exposure to light. Further more the new compounds are more efficient<br><br>
photocatalyst by additional light absorption and energy transfer to the phtalocyanine part of the molecule.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a shading process for textile fiber material, wherein the textile fiber material is treated with a composition comprising at least one Zn-, Ca-, Mg-( NaÂ«, K-, AI, Si-, Ti-, Ge-f Ga-t Zr-, In- or Sn-phthalocyanine to which at least one dyestuff is attached through a covalent bonding.<br>

The composition comprising at least one compound of formula (1a) and/or (1b) produces a relative hue angle of 220 - 320Â° and the compounds of formula (1a) and (1 b) are not light stable. That means that the compounds of formula (1a) and/or (1 b) of the shading composition are destroyed by light. Visible light (400 to 800nm) is meant by the term "light". Preferably, it is sunlight.<br>
Color coordinates and color differences are expressed using the internationally standardized CIELAB tristimulus values: a* = red-green(+,-<br><br>
b* = yellow - blue (+, -)<br>
L* = lightness (light = 100)<br>
C* = chroma<br>
H* = hue (angle of 0Â° = red, 90Â° = yellow, 180Â° = green, 270Â° = blue),<br>
and the color differences AE *, AH *, AC *, AL*. Aa*, and Ab*, together with an identification<br>
number of the sample.<br>
This internationally accepted system has been developed by CIE ("Commission<br>
Internationale de I'Eclairage"). It is for example part of DIN 6174: 1979-01 as well as DIN<br>
5033-3: 1992-07.<br>

Preferably, the degradation of the compound of formula (1a) and formula (1b) when applied onto the textile fiber material does not change the color of the textile fiber material, even if the textile fiber material is treated with these compounds repeatedly.<br>
Examples of suitable textile fiber materials are materials made of silk, wool, polyamide, acrylics or polyurethanes, and, in particular, cellulosic fiber materials and blends of all types. Such fiber materials are, for example, natural cellulose fibers, such as cotton, linen, jute and hemp, and regenerated cellulose. Preference is given to textile fiber materials made of<br><br>
cotton. Also suitable are hydroxyl-containing fibers which are present in mixed fabrics, for example mixtures of cotton with polyester fibers or polyamide fibers.<br>

The granulates (G), (GJ) and (G") are prepared according to known methods. Any known method is suitable to produce granules comprising the inventive mixture. Continuous or discontinuous methods are suitable, Continuous methods, such as spray drying or fluidised bed granulation processes are preferred.<br>
Especially suitable are spray-drying processes in which the active ingredient solution is sprayed into a chamber with circulating hot air. The atomisation of the solution is carried out using single or binary nozzles or is brought about by the spinning effect of a rapidly rotating disc. In order to increase the particle size, the spray-drying process may be combined with additional agglomeration of the liquid particles with solid nuclei in a fluidised bed that forms an integral part of the chamber (so-called fluidised spray). The fine particles (
A further embodiment of the present invention comprises using, for preparation of the granulates, phthalocyanine solutions that have been purified by membrane separation procedures. Such membrane separation processes, such as membrane filration are well known in the prior art and are described for example in "Handbuch der industriellen<br><br>
Fest/Flussig-Filtration", Weinheim: Wiley-VCH 2000 or "Encyclopedia of Analytical Science", S. 3035-3050, New York: Academic Press 1995 or "Ullmann" (5.) A16, 187-258.<br>
If necessary, the granules formed in the spray-dryer are removed in a continuous process, for example by a sieving operation. The fines and the oversize particles are either recycled directly to the process (without being redissolved) or are dissolved in the liquid active ingredient formulation and subsequently granulated again.<br>
The granulates (G), (G') and (G") are resistant to abrasion, low in dust, free-flowing and can be readily metered. They are distinguished especially by very rapid solubility in water. The granulates (G), (G') and (G") preferably have a density in the range from 500 to 900 g/l, dissolve rapidly in water and do not float on the surface of the washing agent solution. They may be added in the desired concentration of the phthalocyanine compound directly to the washing agent formulation.<br>
The content of granulates (G), (G1) and (G") in accordance with the invention in the formulations according to the invention is from to 0.001 to 1 wt-%, preferably from 0.001 to 0.05 wt-% and very especially from 0.005 to 0.03 wt-%.<br>
The washing agent formulation according to the invention can be prepared in a generally known manner.<br>
A formulation in powder form can be prepared, for example, by first preparing an initial powder by spray-drying an aqueous slurry comprising all of the afore-mentioned components except for components D) and E) and then adding the dry components D) and E) and mixing all of them together. It is also possible to start from an aqueous slurry which, although comprising components A) and C), does not comprise component B) or comprises only a portion of component B). The slurry is spray-dried; component E) is then mixed with component B) and added; and then component D) is mixed in dry. The components are preferably mixed with one another in such amounts that a solid compact washing agent composition in granule form is obtained, having a specific weight of at least 500 g/l.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the production of the washing agent composition is carried out in three steps. In the first step a mixture of anionic surfactant (and, where appropriate, a small amount of non-ionic surfactant) and builder substance is prepared. In the second step that mixture is sprayed with the major portion of the non-ionic surfactant and then, in the third<br><br>
step, peroxide and, where appropriate, catalyst, and the granulate according to the invention are added. That method is usually carried out in a fluidised bed. In a further preferred embodiment, the individual steps are not carried out completely separately, so that there is a certain amount of overlap between them. Such a method is usually carried out in an extruder, in order to obtain granulates in the form of "megapearls".<br>
As an alternative thereto, the granulates according to the invention can, for the purpose of admixture with a washing agent in a post-dosing step, be mixed with other washing agent components such as phosphates, zeolites, brighteners or enzymes. A mixture of that kind for post-dosing of the granulates is distinguished by a homogeneous distribution of the granulates according to the invention in the mixture and can consist of, for example, from 5 to 50 % granulates and from 95 to 50 % sodium tripolyphosphate. Where the dark appearance of the granulate in the washing agent composition is to be suppressed, this can be achieved, for example, by embedding the granules in droplets of a whitish meltable substance ("water-soluble wax") or, preferably, by encapsulating the granules in a melt consisting of, for example, a water-soluble wax, as described in EP-B-0 323 407 B1, a white solid (e.g. titanium dioxide) being added to the melt in order to reinforce the masking effect of the capsule.<br>
The detergent may also be formulated as an aqueous liquid comprising 5-50, preferably 10-35 wt-% of water or as a non-aqueous liquid detergent, containing not more than 5, preferably 0-1 wt-% of water. Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions can contain other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5 wt-% to 90 wt-%, typically 10 wt-% to 50 wt-% of such carriers. The detergents can also be present as the so-called "unit liquid dose" form.<br>

By an introduction of suitable substituents, water-soluble phthalocyanines can be obtained after known procedures (DE1569783, DE1569729, DE2021257, DE1794298). The synthesis and use of such metal phthalocyanines for the use as photoactivators are also known (DE0081462 and references cited therein).<br>
A suitable method to obtain water-soluble phthalocyanine is the introduction of sulfonate groups. Generally, the sulfonated phthalocyanines are not pure substances, but complex mixtures of different positional isomers. Also the degree of sulfonation is varying and normally not whole-numbered. For example, a tetra sodium salt of the Zinc phthalocyanine can be prepared after known procedure [J. Griffiths et al., Dyes and Pigments, Vol 33, 65-78 (1997) and literature cited therein].<br>
In the present application, a water-soluble phthalocyanine molecule is being linked through covalent bonds with a dye molecule. A convenient way to realize this linkage is the synthesis of a metal phthalocyanine sulfonyl chloride by a sulfochlorination reaction after known procedures [DE2812261, DE0153278]. By varying the amount of the sulfochlorination agent, the desired degree of sulfochloride content can be adjusted. The sulfochlorination reaction of phthalocyanines generally leads to a main product, but as by-products small amounts of lower or higher degree of sulfonyl chloride groups are detected.<br>
The resulting reactive phthalocyanine-sulfonylchloride can then be reacted further with a suitable dye having an amino group.<br>
To illustrate the synthesis, the following synthetic examples leading to Zinc and Aluminium Phtalocyanines linked with amino-functionalized azo-dyes are given. The syntheses are performed as shown in the following scheme. From the possible positional isomers, only one is shown. The formation of the side products (degree of SO3R and SO2CI) is not shown.<br><br><br><br>
Synthesis Examples<br>
General procedures<br>
1)	Synthesis of a sulfonated Zinc phthalocyanine sulfonyl chloride<br>
Normally the sulfonated Zinc phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid sodium salt is a mixture of different isomers with an average degree of sulfonation about 3.6 - 3.8. The main components are various isomers of tetrasulfonated and trisulfonated Zinc phthalocyanines. Before the reaction, the material must be dried by freeze drying or spray drying. The dried Zinc phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid sodium salt (1 mol) is slowly added under stirring to chlorosulfuric acid (3.5 mol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture is heated at 90-95Â°C for 30 minutes. At this temperature a certain amount of thionyl chloride (1.5 mol) is added dropwise. If the sulfonated Zinc phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid sodium salt contains considerable amounts of water (determination according the Karl-Fischer method), more thionyl chloride (up to 8 mol) must be added. Stirring is continued for another 90 minutes at 90Â°C. The reaction mixture is cooled down to room temperature and added to an excess of ice. The formed green precipitate is filtered off, washed with aqueous sodium chloride (3 %) and dried. The crude green intermediate is directly used for the next reaction step.<br>
2)	Synthesis of a Zinc phthalocyanine dye conjugate<br>
To an aqueous stirred solution of the corresponding dye (0.35 mol) is added the Zinc phthalocyanine sulfonyl chloride prepared in example 1. During the addition, pH is adjusted to 7 with aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The reaction mixture is reacted at pH 7 for 8 hours at room temperature. The reaction control is done by TLC (solvent pyridine 25 ml /N,N-diethyl amine 33 mI/3-methylbutanol/aqueous ammonia (25 %) 25ml). When no starting dye can be detected, the reaction solution is worked-up.<br>
Work-up and purification:<br>
The reaction mixture is desalted by dialysis (cellulose tubes) or by nanofiltration through a<br>
suitable membrane. The desalted reaction solution containes the isomeric mixture of<br>
covalently linked sulfonated Zinc phthalocyanine dye conjugates and starting material (Zinc<br>
phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid). The obtained blue reaction solution can be directly used<br>
for the synthesis of liquid or solid formulations.<br>
A solid Zinc phthalocyanine dye conjugate can be obtained by freeze-drying the desalted<br>
solution.<br><br>
Because there are a lot of possible isomers with regard to the position of the sulfonic acid group and the sulfonamide linkage, the idealized structures are given. The sulfonic acid functions can exist in the free acid form or as in the sodium salt form or as a mixture thereof.<br><br>
138.6 g Zinc phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid sodium salt, 337 ml chlorosulfuric acid and 16 ml of thionylchloride are reacted as given in the general procedure. The reaction mixture is given onto 300 g of ice. The precipitate is isolated as described above. Yield: 696.5 g, green humid solid.<br>
b) Synthesis of a Zinc phthalocyanine bisazo dye conjugate<br><br><br>
To a solution of 1.7 g dye (prepared according to known procedures by diazotation of commercially available 4-amino-azobenzol-4'-sulfonic acid and subsequent coupling to J-acid) in 25 ml destilled water is added under stirring 6.4 g of crude Zinc phthalocyanine monosulfonyl chloride from example 1a. The reaction mixture is diluted with 15 ml destilled water. A pH value of 6.1 of the reaction mixture is adjusted by addition of 1 N sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction is stirred for 10 hours at room temperature. After the reaction is complete (TLC control with solvent mixture pyridine 12.5 ml/N,N-diethylamine 16.6 ml/3-methylbutanol 8.3 ml, aqueous ammonia 25 % 12.5 ml), the product is precipitated with a mixture of 400 ml of an aqueous (1.5 %) sodium chloride solution and 30 ml isopropanol. The crude dark blue reaction product is filtered off and dried at room temperature. The purification step (precipitation with sodium chloride solution/isopropanol) is repeated twice to obtain a pure product. Yield: 1.2 g (48 %), violet solid.<br>
Alternatively, the purification can be done by chromatography. The reaction mixture is concentrated in vacuum and the crude product cleaned by thin layer chromatography (silicagel, solvent mixture as given above).<br>

dye solution, 696.5 g sulfonated Zinc phthalocyanine monosulfonylchloride from example 1a<br>
is added and reacted as described in the general procedure. After 12 h stirring at room<br>
temperature the reaction is complete. The aqueous solution is desalted by dialysis (cellulose<br>
tube, Rsherbrand, MWCO 12.000-14.000). After 12 h of dialysis, the amount of chloride and<br>
sulfat salts is checked. Normally dialysis is complete, otherwise dialysis must be continued<br>
for 20 hours. The obtained solution is freeze-dried to get a blue solid.<br>

Application Examples<br>
Degradation Experiments<br>
An aqueous solution of the photocatalyst was exposed in the given concenctration in a closed 50ml glass bottle to an optical illumination unit (Leitz) equipped with a photooptic lamp Xenophot (Osram HLX 64625). The intensity measured with a Roline RO-1322 Digital Lux meter in front of the bottle was within the range of 111000-120000 Lux. The degradation of the photocatalyst was determined from spectrophotometric data gained with a HP 8452 Diode array spectrophotometer. The absorption was measured at representative wavelengths of the chromophoric components of the photocatalyst (670nm, 540nm). While there is only a small overlap at the absorption maximum originating from the Phthalocyanine part (670nm) of the photocatalyst by the absorption of the attached dye-chromophore, there may be an appreciable overlap at the absorption maximum of the attached dyestuff chromophore itself, depending on its structure, by the Phthalocyanine part. The absorption was determined at the start and then after illumination every 5 respectively 10 min up to 2 hours. The normalized photochemical destruction of the photocatalyst, given as loss in percentage regarding the initial absorption at the selected wavelength is summarized in table 1, covering an illumination period up to 2 hours<br>
Example 14:<br>
An aqueous solution containing 60mg/l of the blue photocatalyst obtained from Example 2 was illuminated following the procedure outlined above. Upon illumination the photocatalyst was degraded to a high extent regarding both chromophoric parts.<br><br>

intensity measured with a Roline RO-1322 Digital Lux meter at the position of the fabric was<br>
within the range of 17000 Lux.) one part was dried in the dark.<br>
This washing cycle was repeated five times and after each washing cycle the Whiteness<br>
(Ganz) and the tint value determined<br>
Example 20:<br>
As reference one set of fabrics was washed with the detergent containing a commercial<br>
photocatalyst Tinolux BMC.<br>

blue photocatalyst obtained from Example 2.<br><br>
Example 23<br>
The detergent used for the washing experiment contained an equivalent of 0.009% of the<br>
blue photocatalyst obtained from Example 2.<br>

washes the fabric was exposed either in dry or wet state for two hours to tungsten light.<br>
