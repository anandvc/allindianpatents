USE OF TRIPROLIDINE IN PROVIDING REFRESHEDNESS ON WAKING<br>
The invention relates to a novel use of a known compound, in particular to the use of that compound in the form of a consumable film in the treatment of sleep disorders experienced by a person, whatever the cause of those disorders<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for the treatment or prevention of grogglness, drowsiness or lethargy on waking from sleep, to the use of triprolldine in the form of a consumable film as an aid to waking refreshed and to the use of triprolldine in the form of a consumable film as both a sleep aid and a means to wake refreshed thereafter.<br>
Although much is known about the use of various pharmaceutical sleeping formulations as aids to sleeping, little has been published about the possibility of a sleep aid enabling an individual to wake refreshed as opposed to merely experiencing degrees of hangover effects such as grogglness, drowsiness, lethargy, etc.<br>
Many people experience, either on an occasional or chronic basis, difficulty in achieving a satisfactory amount of sleep. Such a problem may be attributable to external factors, such as factors causing stress or anxiety, to excessive use or misuse of stimulants (such as caffeine) or depressants (e.g. alcohol), or to temporary disturbance of the person's lifestyle, e.g. occasioned by shift-working or long-haul travel through different timezones. Difficulty in sleeping may also be caused by chronic pain, e.g. pain caused by sciatica etc. Whatever the cause, the condition may be generally considered to be a sleep disorder and may commonly be referred to as "insomnia". It may manifest as difficulty in falling asleep and/or wakefulness during the desired period of sleep, leading to a shortened duration of sleep and/or disruption of the normal pattern of sleep.<br>
The result of these difficulties will commonly be fatigue during the period of wakefulness, which may itself lead to stress and exacerbate the problem.<br><br>
Various products are available to assist a user in overcoming problems of the type described above. Such products, commonly called "sleeping pills" may, however, suffer from disadvantageous side-effects. For example, while the products may be effective in sending a user to sleep, their effect may be of short duration, resulting in premature wakening. In other cases, the user may achieve the desired length of sleep but may awake with feelings of grogginess (a "hangover" effect). Such products may also be addictive. Tolerance may also develop to the drug which results in a decrease in effectiveness.<br>
In other circumstances, a person may not suffer from sleep disorders as such, but may simply wish to achieve a particularly good night's sleep. In other words, the use of such products may be elective, rather than necessitated by a clinical need.<br>
In addition to this well documented problem, many people also experience difficulties on waking such as grogginess, lethargy and drowsiness; difficulty in becoming fully alert and an absence of feeling refreshed. These phenomena are not necessarily linked to the number of hours sleep or always encountered as a result of drugs taken prior to sleep such as alcohol, medication, etc. Furthermore, individuals encountering tiredness during waking hours and other individuals having difficulty with insomnia resort to sleep aids in an attempt to increase or improve sleeptime rest. Nevertheless, it is also well documented that a negative side effect of sleep aids can also be an increased feeling of grogginess on waking.<br>
Triprolidine, (E)-2-[1-(4-methylphenyl-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propenyl]pyridine, is a first generation anti-histamine and has been marketed alone and, in combination with pseudoephedrlne (a decongestant), for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Triprolidine Is known to have sedative effects and has been shown to have an adverse effect on the cognitive functions of users. These are undesirable side-effects for an antl-hlstamlne and may account for the limited extent to which triprolidine has been used In clinical practice. More recently-developed, second generation antihistamines are less prone to such side effects, and most recent studies involving triprolidine have used that compound as a positive control against which the more modern anti-histamlne compounds have been compared. Such studies have generally been conducted using healthy volunteers following day time dosing, rather than persons suffering from<br><br>
any form of sleep disorder, and have been concerned with the effects of the drug on day-time performance.<br>
One study is known to have investigated the effect of triprolidine (amongst other antihistamines) on sleep directly (Nicolson et al, Neuropharmacology (1985) 24, 3, 245-250). In that study single doses of triprolidine (1 Omg or 20mg sustained release) were given at bedtime to volunteers. It was found that triprolidine did not significantly alter "sleep onset latency" (i.e. the time required to fall asleep) compared with placebo. It was also found that, compared with placebo, triprolidine had no effect on wakefulness during sleep or total sleep time.<br>
It has now been found that, contrary to what might have been expected in the light of previous studies, triprolidine can be used for inducing, prolonging or enhancing sleep, and that its use is accompanied by important benefits in comparison with other compounds known for this purpose that could not have been predicted.<br>
It has also been found that triprolidine surprisingly increases the level of refreshedness felt upon waking if taken before sleeping. Advantageously, this effect is observed whilst triprolidine also acts as a sleep aid in facilitating the onset of stage I sleep and whilst enhancing sleep.<br>
The increased level of refreshedness felt upon waking after taking triprolidine prior to sleeping was not expected and there has been no known disclosure of such an effect previously encountered.<br>
The use of consumable films is well known for delivery of drugs via both the buccal cavity and the digestive tract, WO 99/17753, WO 98/26780, WO 98/20862 and WO 98/26763. WO 00/18365 discloses physiologically acceptable films including a water soluble film-forming polymer such as pullulan and antimicrobially effective amounts of the essential oils thymol, methyl salicylate, eucalyptol and menthol. The films can also include pharmaceutical^ active agents. Triprolidine hydrochloride is disclosed as one such pharmaceutical^ active agent. Methods for producing such films are also disclosed.<br><br>

It will also be understood that the term "inducing, prolonging and/or enhancing sleep" may encompass the treatment of a sleep disorder, i.e. a difficulty in achieving satisfactory sleep due to some internal or external factor, e.g. pain, stress or anxiety, misuse of stimulants or depressants, or temporary disturbance of lifestyle. Alternatively, it may encompass elective desires on the part of a user to achieve a particularly beneficial period of sleep. Such a desire may, for instance, arise in anticipation of important events the following day for which a person may wish to be fully alert and refreshed. In any event, the term "sleep disorder" as used herein should be taken to independently include any one or more of the foregoing and, specifically, any objective or subjective difficulty in an individual in any one or more of the followlng:-<br>
-	getting to sleep, especially stage 1 sleep<br>
-	staying asleep<br>
-	sleeping well<br>
-	waking refreshed<br>
-	waking alert<br>
-	keeping awake<br>
-	keeping alert<br><br>
-	keeping refreshed<br>
-	performing well the next day<br>
The present invention also extends to the use of triprolidine as a sleep aid. By definition, a sleep aid extends to use by a healthy individual who elects for a sleep aid, for example, before an important event. The term "sleep aid" as used herein includes any one or more of the following benefits;-<br>
-	faster onset to stage 1 sleep<br>
-	increasing duration of sleep periods<br>
-	decreasing the number and duration of awakenings<br>
-	increasing total duration of sleep<br>
-	increasing probability of sleeping well<br>
-	improving insomnia, especially chronic or mild-moderate insomnia<br>
-	decreasing disturbances during sleeptime<br>
-	improving quality of sleep,<br>
-	as determined by any standard or known subjective or objective measures, for instance the Karolinska scale, Loughborough sleep log or actimetry.<br>
The method of aiding an individual's sleep typically indicates aiding in the sense of providing any one or more of the above mentioned benefits.<br>

Especially preferred is the response in at least between 35-60%, of Individuals, more especially 35-45%.<br>
It will be understood that references herein to "triprolidine" Include the compound (E)-2-[1-(4-methylphenyl-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propenyl]pyridine as well as salts thereof that are acceptable for administration to the human body. Acid addition salts may particularly be mentioned, including the hydrobromide and hydrochloride salts. The hydrochloride salt, i.e. triprolidine hydrochloride, is particularly preferred for use in accordance with the invention. Solvates of triprolidine, notably hydrates, e.g. monohydrates, and to the extent that triprolidine may exist in polymorphic forms, all such polymorphs are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The term "refreshed" as used herein means an individual waking refreshed or alert after a dose of triprolidine has been administered prior to sleep. In this context, the determination of whether an individual is feeling "refreshed" may be made by a subjective test. An example subjective test is measuring the degree of alertness on, for instance, the Karolinska scale or the feeling of being refreshed as determined by, for instance, the Loughborough sleep log. Alternatively, refreshedness may be based upon the inverse relationship between refreshedness and relative levels of sleepiness as determined by the Karolinska scale.<br>
By the term individual as referred to herein is meant any mammal or human.<br>
The administration of the active ingredient in accordance with the invention may be beneficial in that there is evidence that users feel more refreshed upon awakening, which is not the case with other treatments for sleep disorders, or indeed in the absence of any treatment, and do not experience grogginess or a "hangover" effect after the required number of hours sleep. This too is surprising in view of the fact that such feelings have been reported in relation to other active ingredients which have a comparable mode of action to that of triprolidine.  Furthermore, there is no evidence<br><br>
that repeated use of the active ingredient over the course of several days leads to any loss of effect.<br>
The administration of the active ingredient in accordance with the invention may also be beneficial in that it may decrease the time required for a user to fall asleep, which is surprising in view of the previously-reported studies on volunteers. In addition, the total period of sleep may be increased and the incidence and duration of night-time wakenings experienced by the user may be reduced.<br>
The active ingredient may be co-administered, either simultaneously or sequentially, with another pharmacologically active agent, presently preferred formulations contain triprolidine as the sole active agent and also triprolidine in combination with a further pharmaceutical^ active agent.<br>
The invention extends to a kit comprising a first pharmaceutical^ active dosage form having triprolidine as the active agent, a second pharmaceutical^ active dosage form and instructions on how to administer the said first and second dosage forms.<br>
The said first and second dosage forms may be located In separate compartments of a pharmaceutical pack.<br>
The said dosage forms may be combined into a combined dosage form for simultaneous administration.<br>
Preferably, the said at least one further active pharmaceutical agent is Intended to be used in the treatment of a condition having sleep disorder as a symptom or potential symptom.<br>

Clinical Trial<br>
The efficacy of triprolidine in enabling a patient to feel refreshed or alert upon waking after taking triprolidine prior to sleeptime was investigated using patients with a history of sleep disorders and utilising triprolidine prepared in accordance with example 1.<br>
The study herein utilised the following determination methods:-<br>
(a)	Karolinska scale as defined in: Int. J. Neuroscience 52 29-37 (1990); and - validation: Sleep 17 (3) 236-41 (1994)<br>
(b)	Loughborough Sleep log as defined in : Sleep 17 (2) 146-159 (1994); and<br>
Sleep 18 (2) 127-134 (1995)<br>
(c) Actimetry - AW4 actimeters (Cambridge Neurotechnology) were worn continuously throughout the study. A button was pressed at night when the subject desired to go to sleep and again in the morning upon waking. The results of the actimeter study were analysed in the manner defined by Home etal (Sleep, 17(2); 146-159).<br>
SDI% was calculated as follows:-<br>
SDI =	Number of 30 second epochs with movement	x 100<br>
Number of 30 second epochs from total time spent in bed This is the measure of:<br>
1.	The length of time it took to fall asleep<br>
2.	Any awakenings throughout the sleep period Expressed as a % of total time spent in bed.<br>
Study Objectives<br>
•    To evaluate the effects of two doses of triprolidine compared with placebo.<br><br>
Study Design<br>
A multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised study investigating the effects of 2.5mg and 5mg triprolidine in patients with temporary sleep disturbance.<br>
Male and Female candidates aged 18 years and above were recruited to one of five research centres by means of local advertising. Candidates were screened by means of a telephone questionnaire and selected candidates Invited for Interview at the research centre. Key inclusion criteria used to select candidates for the study were;<br>
•	A record of poor sleep at least 2 nights per week<br>
•	A record of poor sleep for at least 1 week but not more than 3 months<br>
•	Sleep disturbance not caused by underlying disease<br>
•	No excess use of alcohol or drugs<br>
•	Sleep disturbance affected daytime functioning<br>
The candidates came to the research centre on Thursday or Friday and were fitted with a wrist actimeter (AW4 from Cambridge Technology) to establish a baseline measure for SDI and were provided with diary cards to record subjective assessments for the Loughborough Sleep Log and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. They returned to the investigational site on the Monday and were issued with the study compositions (2.5mg triprolidine, 5mg triprolidine or placebo). The investigator telephoned a central randomisation centre where the subject was randomised to a particular treatment group using a dynamic balanced randomisation algorithm. The subject was given three doses of their allocated study medication and instructed to take a single dose of two tablets 20 minutes before they intended to go to sleep on three consecutive evenings, commencing that evening. The diary cards for the Loughborough Sleep Log and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale were asked to be completed on waking.<br>
The candidates returned to the research centre on the following Friday.<br><br>
Parameters Evaluated<br>
Candidates were required to complete a questionnaire 15 minutes after awaking on the feeling of refreshedness assessed on a 5-point scale, the Loughborough sleep log.<br>
A daytime sleepiness assessment was also made 20 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours after awaking on the Karolinska 9-point scale, i.e. the sleepiness scale.<br>
Results<br>
198 candidates completed the study, of whom 178 provided valuable data. (61 placebo, 60 on 2.5mg triprolidine and 57 on 5mg triprolidine. The subjects on 2.5mg dose took one tablet and placebo those on 5mg dose took 2x2.5mg tablets. The subjects on placebo took a dose to match the active treatments (2 tablets).<br>
Key results were as follows:<br>
•	There was evidence that there was a lack of daytime sleepiness associated with those patients who took either dose of triprolidine<br>
•	The SDI was reduced for both treatments as compared with placebo on every treatment night<br>
•	The sleep latency onset was reduced for both treatments as compared with placebo on every treatment night<br>
The following results were obtained for patients taking 2.5mg triprolidine. For the mean of the 3 nights:<br>
•	15 minutes after waking, patients taking triprolidine recorded feeling more refreshed than those on placebo, as determined by the Loughborough sleep log(p 
•	There were a greater percentage of people on 2.5mg triprolidine who, on waking were feeling alert, very alert or extremely alert than those on placebo as measured by the Karolinska log.<br><br>
•	There was a lower percentage of people on 2.5mg triprolidine who, on waking were feeling sleepy, and needing to make some effort or very sleepy, needing to make a great effort to keep awake than those on placebo as measured by the Karolinska log.<br>
•	There was no evidence of residual hangover effects / morning grogginess from the drug.<br>
•	The SDI was significantly reduced compared to those on placebo (p
•	The sleep latency onset was reduced as compared to those on placebo (p
Further analyses show the advantageous effects of triprolidine in relation to the degree of refreshedness on waking.<br>
The study design used 3 groups. On average, the number of individuals in each of the 3 groups (placebo, 2.5mg triprolidine and 5mg triprolidine) was 60 ± 10 patients.<br>
In the trial, patients were tested during a seven day period and the results have been analysed for a mean of three days in the middle of this period. The effects of triprolidine at dose level 2.5mg and 5.0mg are compared with placebo in table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Statistical Analysis<br>
Generally the treatment groups were well balanced in terms of the demographic data. Unless otherwise mentioned all group data was analysed using ANOVA. In two cases, namely, how the patient felt 15 minutes after awakening in the Loughborough Sleep Log and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale at 20 minutes, the two variables were analysed using ANCOVA by including the weekend and the mean of Friday/Saturday/Sunday night as a covariate. The method was a closed test procedure (Williams' test). Each of the tests were to be conducted at the 5% level. The analysis of the secondary endpoints was similarly conducted using the Student's t-tests on parameter estimates taken from the analysis of variance model presented above.<br>
The following is a copy of the "Loughborough sleep log questionnaire" which was used by patients in the study and provided the data for datasets a and b in table 1.<br>
