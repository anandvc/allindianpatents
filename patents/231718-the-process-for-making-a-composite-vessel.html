				<td>The present invention relates to the process for making a composite vessel.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the art of fabricating pressure vessels and, more particularly, to improved methods for fabricating composite pressure vessels and to composite pressure vessels nude in accordance with the improved methods. Background of the Invention<br>
Pressure vtssets, such as hot water heaters, boilers, pressurized gas tanks and the like, have traditionally been fabricated from metal such as steeL   However, in recent years, the use of composite pressure vessels has become more prevalent.  These composite pressure vessels have typically been fabricated by a filament winding process which utilizes theraksset plastic resins such as epexies, polyesters and vinylestes. Briefly, this technology is the process of impregnating dry fibers, such as fiberglass strands, with catalyzed resin prior to application to a mandrel. Preimpregnated fibers ("prepreg") may also be used. The mandrel and applied composite are then cured, at ambient temperature or with heat, to set-up the laminate and obtain a hard resin and fiber laminate shell. This shell is cither removed from the mandrel or the mandrel itself becomes part of the finished product. Although the specific product application determines the exact function of the resin, in all cases, in all cases it serves as the support structure for keeping the continuous fiber strands in position.<br>
The thermoset resins used in diese processes can be categorized as of the low temperature commodity type which are characterized by their relative ease of use, low cost and availability. These resins have long served to meet the performance requirements of a wide range of pressure vessel products. However, these resin systems have-well known drawbacks which may include their limited temperature capabilities, unsatisfactory finished product aesthetics, lack of extended durability, lack of appropriateness for recycling and manufacturing related issues such as downtime due to cleaiwip and material handing costs. Further, there are environmental concerns arising from worker exposure to vapor, oversprsy, emissions, etc. encountered during the fabrication processes. Some engineered thermoset resins improve performance through higher temperature capability, but unacceptable material costs are associated with mem.<br>
In addition, because of the materials and processes employed, composite pressure vessels prepared according to the prior art processes inherentlyhave residusi sod significant internal stresses which, along with certain temperature sensitive incompseibilities of the materials, limit the pressure and temperature ranges in which the pressure vessels find use.<br>
Thus, increasing performance demands, environmental issues, manufacturing issues and new market opportunities have emphasised the limitations of the use of thermoset resins in the<br>
manufacture of composite pressure vessels. Composite pressure vessels with higher temperature and pressure capabilities, improved appearance and greater durability and impact resistant characteristics and which, as to fabrication, are more environmentally-friendly, more cost effective and present fewer manufacturing issues, are accordingly highly desirable.<br>
Therefore, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that a process for fabricating composite pressure vessels which achieves improvement in all these areas requires a fundamentally different philosophy. It is to the provision of such a fundamentally improved process, and to pressure vessels made by such process that the present invention is directed and by which the following characteristics are obtained: improved contact at higher temperatures between the fiber and resin, better control over reinforcement/matrix ratio, scrap materials which can be effectively recycled, diminished regulation issues caused by emissions, higher processing speeds for the winding (or other overlaying mode) and curing steps, potential labor savings due to less material handling, floor space reduction, adaptability to automation, a safer environment for employees, simplification of processing lines and of material storage and handling, faster changeover times, faster startups, lower training coses, lower energy costs, etc.' Therefore, pressure vessels fabricated according to the process are substantially stress relieved and exhibit improved performance over the prior art pressure vessels in that, inter alia, they can withstand higher pressures and temperatures, are more impact resistant and also have a significantly better finish, Objects of the Invention<br>
It is therefore a broad object of this invention to provide an improved process for fabricating a composite pressure vessel.<br>
It is more particular an object of this invention to provide such an improved process which enjoys advantages including, as opposed to prior art processes of fabricating composite pressure vessels: better control over reinforcement/matrix ratio, scrap materials which can be effectively recycled, diminished regulation issues caused by emissions, higher processing speeds for the winding (or alternatives to winding) and curing steps, substantial labor savings due to legs material handling, floor space reduction, susceptibility to automation, a safer environment for employees, simplification of processing lines and of material storage and handling, faster changeover times, raster startups, lower training costs, lower energy costs, etc.<br>
In anodier aspect, it is an object of this invention to provide a process for fabricating<br>
composite pressure vessels which, in use, enjoys long term performance at least as good as that of<br>
traditional pressure vessels.	<br>
In yet another aspect it is an object of this invention to provide high quality composite pressure vessels fabricated according to new processes.<br>
In still yet another aspect, it is an object of this invention to provide high quality composite<br>
pressure vessels which have improved durability, impact resistance and corrosion resistance as well as higher temperature and pressure handling characteristics and which also have good machinabiltty attributes and can therefore readily be welded, cut. drilled, threaded, stamped or the like as may be desired to produce a high quality finished product. Summary of the Invention<br>
Briefly, these and other objects of the invention are achieved by a process for fabricating a composite vessel which includes: A) fabricating a thermoplastic liner for the vessel; B) overlaying onto the thermoplastic liner a commingled layer of fiber (such as fiberglass) and a thermoplastic material to obtain a composite intermediate structure; C) pressing and heating the composite intermediate structure! to effect at least partial consolidation of the components thereof in apparatus which includes an upper silicon rubber bag and a lower silicon rubber bag, the bags having dimensions such that, when in operative pressing and heating mutual positions, their facing peripheral regions abut to substantially encompass the composite intermediate structure: D) placing the at least partially consolidated composite intermediate structure in a mold; E) heating the composite intermediate structure in the mold while applying at least one force, such as internal gas pressure, thereto tending to urge the composite intermediate structure against and into the shape of the interior walls of ithe mold; F) continuing step E) until the thermoplastic liner and the overlaid layer fully consolidate to form a composite vessel; G) cooling the mold and composite vessel until the composite vessel is solidified; and H) removing the formed composite vessel from the mold. The commingled fiber and thermoplastic material may either be wound onto the liner or laid on the liner in the form of fabric woven from the fiber and threads of the thermoplastic material.<br>
In a variant embodiment of the invention; the process for making a composite vessel includes the steps of: A) fabricating a thermoplastic preform including a layer comprising commingled fiber and thennoplastic material; B) pressing and heating the preform to effect consolidation of the components thereof in pressing and heating apparatus which includes: 1) an inner membrane disposed on a first side of the thermopiastic preform; 2) an outer membrane disposed on a second side of the thermoplastic preform; 3) a vacuum source and conduit for evacuating dw space between the inner and outer membranes to thereby apply force to the preform; 4) an inner shaped contact heater placed in contact with said inner membrane to apply consolidating heat to the first side of the preform; and 5) an outer shaped contact heater placed in contact with said outer membrane to apply consolidating heat to the second side of the preform; C) after the preform has become fluid, placing the inner and outer membranes and the fluid consolidated preform disposed therebetween in a cold mold; D) applying at least one force to the fluid consolidated preform to urge the walls thereof against said inner and outer membranes and into the shape of the interior walls of the mold to form a composite vessel; and E) removing the formed composite vessel<br>
from the mold. Description of the Drawing<br>

Referring first to FIGs. 1 and 2, there is shown a thermoplastic liner/mandrel 1 for a composite pressure vessel to be fabricated according to a first inventive embodiment. In the exemplary embodiment, the liner/mandrel 1 is a generally elongated preformed structure terminating at each end in a dome shape 2, 3 having a central, axial opening 4,5. Thermoplastic liner 1 may, for example, be made of polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutylene terephthaiate, polyethylene terephthalate or fiber (e.g„ fiberglass) impregnated polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutylene terephthalate or polyethylene terepbthalaie or another thermoplastic material with appropriate characteristics and can be prepared by any suitable conventional process such as molding a combination of chopped fiber, directional, woven and/or knitted fiber fabric sewn or welded together in the shape of the vessel and commingled with dwrmoplastic material.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a filament, roving, yarn or tape 6 of fiber (e.g., fiberglass, carbon fiber, boron fiber, etc) and a thermoplastic material is methodically wound onto the outer surface of the thermoplastic liner 1 to form a substantially uniform overlay 7 as shown in the enlarged partial cross<br>
section in FIG. 4. This step may be carried out. for example, by mounting the thermoplastic liner 1 onto a mandrel 8 and rotating the finer as indicated by the arrow 9 white methodically feeding the filament(s). roving, yam or tape 6 from a laterally and reciprocally traversing source as represented by the double arrow 10 and continuing this procedure until the overlay 7 has reached the desired thickness. The material 6 nay be wound "cold" onto the thermoplastic liner 1 or may be passed through a heater 12 which, in some applications, results in a more uniform overlay ? (FIG. 4) with better functional and/or aesthetic characteristics. The resulting structure 11 is then processed further as will be described in detail below.<br>
It has been found to be desirable to suitably vary the feed rate in the regions of the domes and end pieces so dot a substantially uniform thickness of the overlay throughout the length of the liner 1 is obtained. Alternative winding techniques for achieving a satisfactorily uniform overlay are well known in the prior art, and reference may be taken, for example, to US Patent 3,282,757 entitled METHOD OF MAKING A FILAMENT REINFORCD PRESSURE VESSEL by Richard C. Brussee. incorporated by reference herein and disclosing various winding techniques which may be employed in the practice of the present invention.<br>
However, the form, and especially the type, of the fiber and thermoplastic material 6 is of significant importance to the practice of the invention such that attention is briefly directed to FIGs. 5A, SB, SC, 6A, 6B and 7 which illustrate suitable variants of the material 6 which may be employed In the <br>
practice of the invention. In FIG. 5A, separate strands of thermoplastic materia) 13A and fiber 12A are wound together or sepanuely, but mote or less contiguously, as indicated at 6A, onto the liner/mandrel I. Suitable types of thennoplastic material 13A which may be used in the practice of the invention for this purpose include, but are not limited to, polyeuiylene, polypropylene, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephtbalate.<br>
FIG. SB shows a cross section of a second variant 6B for the material 6 in which the fiber filament 12B is coated with the diermoplastic material 13B by, for example, double extrusion or by any odter suitable preliminary process. Similarly, FIG. SC shows a cross section of a third variant 6B for the material 6 in which the fiber filament 12C is coated with a powder of the thermoplastic material 13C.<br>
Preferably, however, the fiber 12 and diermoplastic material 13 (in any of the forms shown in FIGs. 5A, SB, SC), before winding onto the liner/mandrel 1, are first commingled into a roving 6D as shown in FIG. 6A or into a yam 6E of such rovings as shown in FIG. 6B. Another preferred configuration for the material 6 is shown in FIG. 7 as a tape 6F of commingled fiber and diermoplastic material. Suitable rovings, yams and tapes of commingled fiber, e.gi, fiberglass, and thermoplastic material are commercially available, and one product family which has been found to be well suited for use in the present invention is distributed under the trademark Twintex* by Vetrotex.  Twintex is<br>
prepared by a proprietary process which involves commingling filaments of fiberglass (e.g., 17 micrometers in diameter) with filaments (e.g., 20 micrometers in diameter) of thermoplastic (e.g.. polyethylene or polypropylene) during the continuous production of rovings. yams and tapes which are available as such and also in the form of fabrics.<br>
Thus, merely by way of example, the thermoplastic liner/mandrel I may, itself, be fabricated from Twintex® fabric which is sewn or welded together and suitably heat treated, for example, in,a mold, to obtain the preform which is subsequently wound with the fiber and thermoplastic materia! 6 to obtain the intermediate structure 11.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8. after the intermediate structure 11 has been prepared as described or in any suitable manner, it is placed in a mold 13 (two-piece in the example). The mold is then heated, for example, by embedded resistance heaters represented by the heater 15B controllably driven from a source E ISA and/or by circulating hot oil, heated by a source H HA, through coils 14B and/or any other suitable conventional mold-heating expedient. In addition, at least one force is applied to the moid 13 and/or the inferior of the intermediate structure 11 which tends to cause the exterior surface of the intermediate structure to conform to the inner surface 13A (FIG. 9) of the mold when the applied heat Q causes the thermoplastic liner 1 and the wound overlay 7 to fuse together and flow against the mold. The force or forces may be generated by applying external compression to the mold halves so as to urge them together as indicated by the arrows designated "P and/or by pressurizing the interior of the thermoplastic liner 1 by, for example, using gas pressure from a suitable source 16 conveyed into the liner 1 through a conduit 18. If pressurization is employed, caps (threaded or permanent) 19 serve to seal the ends of the intermediate structure 11.<br>
The heat is then removed from the mold 13 allowing the now formed composite pressure vessel to harden and to be removed by evening the mold in the conventional manner.<br>
In practice, two important optional considerations may be taken into account. First, it has been found out the mold should be vented, as represented by (he peripherally distributed vents 17 shown in FIG. 8, to allow the trapped air to escape as the pressure vessel forms against the inner wall of the mold and thus achieve a particularly fine finish to the outer surface of the pressure vessel which requires little, if any, further surface finish. Second, in order to be assured of complete fusion between the thermoplastic liner 1 and the wound overlay 7, it has been found preferable to select respective materials with somewhat different melting temperatures for the liner and the overlay. More particularly, the best results are obtained if the heating rate is controlled and the melting point of the liner is selected to be above that of the overlay in order that the thermoplastic material effectively melts around the fiber while the liner is softened, but not fully melted during the molding process. For example, as well known in the art, the melting point range of polypropylene is 300OF to 330OF while that of polyethylene is 12G°F to 140°F.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, the composite pressure vessel can be fabricated according to a similar process in which a two-piece mold 20, provided with mating flanges 21. 22 which bolt together, is used, thus fully defining a predetermined three dimensional shape for the tntenor surface of the assembled mold. In this configuration, the intermediate structure 11 is placed into the mold which is assembled. Then, heat Q is applied as described above while the interior of the intermediate structure is pressurized to form the composite pressure vessel. In this variant, there is no need to apply external compressive forces to the mold. Preferably, vents 17 are provided for the reasons noted above.<br>
FIGs. 11. 12 and 13 illustrate a different, but related, process for fabricating a composite pressure vessel. For clarity, these FIGs. are shown in cross section. Referring to FIG. 11. a preform 31 is placed in a two-piece mold 30A, 30B. The preform 31, which will serve as an outer shell for the' composite pressure vessel to be fabricated, may be prepared in the manner previously described for the thermoplastic liner 1, but alternatively may be prepared in the manner previously described for the intermediate structure 11; i.e., the thermoplastic liner 1 wound with the overlay 7 of fiber and a thermoplastic material<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, a parison 32 of molten thermoplastic material, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephdialate. is extruded as an elongated tube through an axial opening 37 in the upper end of the preform 31. The material of the parison 32 is selected to form a good bond with a given preform 31. An insert 33, which may be threaded or permanent, is juxtaposed with Tespect to the axial opening 37 and within the parison 32. Similarly, if the preform 31 includes a second axial opening 38, another insert 34 is juxtaposed in the second opening.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the molten parison 32 stores a gnat deal of latent heat. Thus, referring now to FIG. 13, the mold halves 30A, 30B are closed, and the interior of the parison is pressurized from a source 35 of pressurized gas via conduit 36 such that the thermoplastic material 32A in the parison not only flows against the inner surface of the preform 31 A, but also imparts sufficient heat to the preform 31A so as to render it fluid. Consequently, the outer surface of the preform 31A flows to conform to the inner surface of the mold, the inserts 33A, 34A melding with the remainder of the structure or defining removable inserts as may be intended.<br>
If, in a given configuration, there is insufficient latent beat in the parison to bring about complete consolidation of the preform and the thermoplastic material and the intended conformance of the outer surface of the preform to the interior surface of the mold, then additional heat Q can be applied to the mold to complete the formation of the pressure vessel 37. The moid can then be allowed to cool (or be conventionally force cooled) and opened such that the completed pressure vessel can be removed<br>
FIGs. 14,15 and 16 (shown in cross section) illustrate another molding process for forming<br>
a preform 41 into a pressure vessel 41A. Referring first to FIG. 14, the preform 41 may be prepared according to any of the corresponding processes previously described including the process described in conjunction with FIGs. 1 - 10 which involves winding commingled fiber and a thermoplastic material onto a thermoplastic liner which may, itself, have been prepared by welding or sewing together components of commingled fiber and a thermoplastic material. Or. the preform 41 may be relatively roughly molded from a suitable thermoplastic material such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The preform 41, which, in the example, has axial openings 44, 46. is introduced into a two-piece mold 40A. 40B. Then, threaded inserts 43, 45 are juxtaposed in the openings 44. 46 (Of course, inserts such as those 33, 34 employed in the process illustrated in FIGs. II . 13 or some other insert type could alternatively be employed depending upon the precise configuration of the pressure vessel sought.) If threaded inserts are employed, their material is selected to have a melting point which is well above the melting point of the preform 41. At least one of the inserts includes an opening for admitting a silicone rubber inflatable bag 42 into the interior of the preform 48. In addition, a heater48 is disposed within the inflatable bag 42 which is selected to have heat handling capabilities higher than the melting point of the preform 41, A suitable silicone rubber for the inflatable bag 42 is Mosites 14S3D supplied by Mosites Rubber in the United States and Aero vac Systems (Kcighley) Ltd. in the United Kingdom.<br>
The heater 48 may be of any suitable type such as a resistance electrical heater, power also being supplied by conductors (not shown) which extend through the opening in the threaded insert 43 and are coupled to a suitable controllable power source (not shown). In addition, provision may be made, if necessary or desirable, for separately preheating the preform 41 such as by providing an array of heaters, represented by the electrical resistance heaters 47A, 47B, proximate the walls of the preform. Power to the heaters 47A, 47B may be supplied via conductors (not shown) which extend through one or the other or both of the axial openings 44,46 in the preform 41 and are coupled to a suitable controllable power source (not shown). The mold 40A, 40B, itself may also be conventionally preheated and/or heated during the molding process.<br>
If the preform 41 is to be preheated (typically to increase the throughput of the process), this step is carried out to render the preform near fluid and the beaters 47A. 47B are withdrawn from the mold 40A, 40B which is men closed. Referring now to FIG, 15, the inflatable silicone rubber bag 42 is inflated by a source 49 of gas under pressure via a conduit 50 while the heater 48 heats the preform 41 to a fluid state through the bag such that bag exerts outwardly directed forces on the preform which therefore flows to conform to the interior surface of the mold 40A, 40B to form the pressure vessel 41A. ft will be noted duu, in the example, the axial opening regions of the preform flow to conform to the threads of the inserts 43,45.<br>
The application of heat is then ceased, and when the mold 40A, 40B and formed pressure vessel 41A have sufficiently cooled, the mold is opened, the threaded inserts 43,45 are unscrewed and the silicone rubber bag 42 and heater 48 are withdrawn leaving the formed pressure vessel. It will be noted that, as represented at 51, internal threads have been formed, as intended in the example, in the axial openings of the formed composite pressure vessel.<br>
In the preparation of some composite pressure vessels, such as household water heaters, the color of the finished product may be of importance. It is. of course, possible to prepare a preform according to any of the previously described processes using material(s) which are already colored. However, there are two potential objections to this straightforward approach: viz.: the precoiored raw materials are more expensive, and a limited number of colors are available in the precoiored raw materials. However, using the principles of the present invention, color may be imparted to a finished pressure vessel in a different and highly satisfactory manner.<br>
Similarly, there are applications for pressure vessels, such as ultra-pure water storage, gas (e.g., propane, butane, natural gas. etc.) storage and food storage, in which it is desirable to provide an integral impermeable inner liner within a composite pressure vessel. Again, a process for providing such an integral impermeable inner liner may be developed according to the present invention. For convenience, an example, shown in FlGs. 17 - 20, treats both the provision of a desired external color to a composite pressure vessel as well as the provision of an integral impermeable inner liner. It will be understood that either feature can be individually provided.<br>
Thus, referring to FIG. 17, an assembly including a preform 63 (fabricated according to any of the previously described methods), surrounded by a film 67 of thermoplastic.material of the desired product color, is introduced into a two-piece mold 60A, 60B. If an integral impermeable inner liner is to be implemented, a thermoplastic film 66 having the desired characteristics is introduced into the interior of the preform 63 before inserts 64.65 are suitably juxtaposed The mold 60A. 60B includes respective facing relieved sections 6IA, 6tB and 62A, 62B which, when the mold is closed, provides passages wto the mold interior.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 18, the mold 60A, 60B is closed, and the interior of the mold is coupled to a vacuum source 68 via a conduit 69. Alternatively, or additionally, the interior of the inner liner 66 (or the interior of the preform 63 if no inner liner is to be incorporated) is coupled to a source 70 of gas under pressure via a conduit 71. As shown in FIG. 19, heat Q is applied to the mold in order to bring all the constituents of the composite pressure vessel to be formed to a fluid state while the interior of <br>
the mold is evacuated as repnaented by the arrows 72 and the interior of the inner liner 66 (or of the preform 63 if there is no inner liner) is pressurized as represented by the arrows 73. Consequently, the three (or two) components consolidate and the outer surface of the colored film 67 conforms to the <br>
shape of the interior of the mold 60A, 603. After the mold has been allowed to cool (or force cooled)<br>
and has been opened, the resulting composite pressure vessel 74, shown in FIG. 20 (as a cross section slice), is ready for any subsequent processing. As previously noted, of course, the inserts 64, 65, can be threaded for subsequent removal leaving one or two axial openings as may be appropriate for the intended purpose of the composite pressure vessel<br>
A similar process for fabricating a pressure vessel is illustrated in FIGs. 21 - 23, FIG. 21 shows a two-piece mold 80A. 80B which may be, for example, a simple sheet metal mold such that a number of pressure vessels may be formed simultaneously. The mold, which is shown emplaced in a suitable oven 81, has been loaded with a preform 82 fabricated according to any of the methods and of any of the materials and/or combinations of materials previously described above and having at least one opening for access tothe interior thereof. A thermoplastic film bag 83, which is intended to function as an integral liner in the completed pressure vessel, is introduced into the interior of the preform 82 before the moid 80A, 80B is closed.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 22, as heat Q is transferred from the oven 81 to the mold 80A, 80B, gas pressure P (from any suitable source, not shown) is applied to the interior of the thermoplastic film bag 83, thereby biasing it toward the inner surface of the preform 82. In addition, vacuum V (from any suitable source, not shown) is pulled on the interior of the mold 80A, 80B and thus exterior to the preform 82. This state is continued until the plastic materials of the preform 82 and plastic film bag consolidate and the outer surface of the composite structure assumes the shape of the: interior of the mold. Then, the mold is taken from the oven 81. allowed to cool and opened to remove the completed composite pressure vessel 85 which is shown in FIG. 23 as made up of the integral structure including the molded preform 82A and the plastic film liner 83A which has fused to the interior of the composite pressure vessel.<br>
Attention is now directed to FIGs. 24A • 27C which illustrate a further inventive embodiment that is particular 
Still referring to FIGs. 24A and 24B, upper 92A and lower 92B press plates respectively carry inflatable silicon rabberbags 93A, 93B which, as particularly shown in FIG. 24B, may enclose<br>
heaters 94A, 94B. The silicon rubber bags 93A, 93B may be fabricated, for example, from Mosites 14S3D which has been identified above. As also shown in FIG. 24B, additional heaters 95A. 9SB may be provided to afford supplementary preheat of the layer 91 and the underlying thermoplastic mandrel 90 which are to be preformed. A tube 96, which will be used to provide access to the interior of the preform later in the process, is emplaced at one end of the preliminary structure of thermoplastic and fiber as shown in FIGs. 24A and 24B.<br>
Thus, the flexible thermoplastic mandrel 90 overlaid with the layer 91 as shown in FICs. 24A and-24B, is uniformly preheated by the heaters 94A, 948, 95A. 95B to institute the process of consolidation of the thermoplastic and fiber elements in the structure. When the consolidation process has proceeded to a point at which the thermoplastic/fiber layer 91 and thermoplastic mandrel 90 have sufficiently fused for the successive step shown in FIG. 24C. one or both of the press plates 92A, 92B are moved toward one another until the outboard portions of the bags 93A, 93B abut in the regions 97A, 97B which, in effect, extend continuously about the facing peripheral regions of the bags so that the mandrel 90 and layer 91 are completely encompassed. The bladders 93A, 93B may be permanently or controllably pressurized to ensure effective operation.<br>
While the apparatus is in the position shown in FIG. 24C, the heating operation continues from heaters 94A. 94B until the consolidation of the thermoplastic material and fiber has been fully completed such that the material 91 and mandrel 90, once cooled, constitute a closed preform except for the opening in one end provided by the presence of the tube 96.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 25 which shows one-half of a mold 99, the consolidated preform 98 (shown in cross section) has been placed in the interior of the mold with the rube 96 extending through a seal member 100 (shown in cross section). The interior surface of the mold 99, when both halves are mated, defines the outer surface of the composite pressure vessel being fabricated. The mold 99 also include* vests 101 as previously described.<br>
FIG. 26 shows the mold 99 closed with heat Q applied, if necessary, to maintain sufficient fluidity of the preform for the molding step. Pressure is introduced into the interior of the preform through the tube 96 such that the preform expands outwardly until its outer surface engages the inner surface of the mold to thus establish the outer surface of the composite pressure vessel 102. Air in the mold outboard the preform escapes through the vents 101 as the preform expands under pressure during the expansion step. As explained above with respect to odtcr invention embodiments, vacuum may be asserted through the vents 101 or otherwise introduced into the interior of the mold 00 outboard the preform 98 to supplement or replace the pressure introduced into the interior of the <br>
preform.<br>
After the composite pressure vessel 102 (the fully expanded preform 98) has been formed in <br>
the mold 99, the mold is sufftciendy cooled or allowed to cool to permit opening and removal of the<br>
pressure vessel which is illustrated in FIGs. 27A, 27B, 27C after the tube 26 has been removed. Thus, the end of the composite pressure vessel shown in FIG. 27C is closed whereas the end shown in FIG. 27 B has only the small opening left after the removal of the tube 96. It will be understood that this opening may be sealed or threaded or subjected to such other operations as may be appropriate for the intended use of the completed composite pressure vessel. Further, the size of the tube 96 may be selected to facilitate such finishing operations. If desired, the composite pressure vessel 102 may also be further processed to add exterior and/or interior liners in the manner previously described.<br>
FIGs. 28A. 28B. 29, 30A and 30B show a variant process to that shown in FIGs. 24A 27C. Referring first to FIG. 2SA. a commingled thermoplastic preform 112. such as a flexible thermoplastic mandrel/liner overlaid with a layer of material constituting a thermoplastic combined with a fiber material as previously described, is positioned between an inner membrane 111 and an outer membrane 113. The inner metnbranelll and outer membrane 113 may be fabricated, for example, from the silicone rubber material previously identified. Then, as shown in FIG. 28B. a vacuum is pulled, via tube 114, between the membranes 111, 113 to remove air and apply an atmospheric consolidation pressure A to the preform 112.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 29A, an inner shaped contact heater 1 ISA and an outer shaped contact heater 115B are positioned, respectively, facing the inner membrane 112 and outer membrane 113. Then, as shown in FIG. 29B, the contact heaters USA, 11SB are brought into contact, respectively, with the outer surfaces of the inner membrane 111 and the outer membrane 113. Sufficient.heat is transferred from the contact heaters 114A, 114B to the membranes 111 113 to raise the temperature of the preform to about 185oC . 195°C in order to melt the commingled thermoplastic preform 112 and render the prefonn fluid.<br>
While the working contours of the contact heaters 1 ISA, 1 IS B in the example are illustrated as respectively concave and convex, it will be understood that any suitable working contour for each contact heater may be selected for processing a commingled thermoplastic given preform.<br>
As shown in FIG. 30A the fluid and consolidated preform 112 is next placed into a cold mold 116A, 116B. The cold moid is then closed, FIG. 30B. and gas pressure is introduced into the interior of the fluid preform, via tube 117 (or by evacuating the exterior of the prefonn) to cause its walls to expand outwardly against the inner surfaces of the membranes 111, 113 until the outer surfaces of the membranes confirm to the contours of the inner wells of the cold mold 116A, 116B. As a result, the preform 112 is simultaneously formed and cooled (by heat transfer to the cold mold 116A, 116B) to ' effect the pressure vessel 118 which can be removed from the cold mold and finished as may be desired in accordance with the foregoing descriptions.<br>
Composite pressure vessels fabricated in accordance with all the processes disclosed above have performance and aesthetic characteristics significandy improved over those fabricated with die<br>
prior art processes. More particularly, they can withstand higher pressures and temperatures, are more impact resistant and exhibit a. significantly better finish. They also have good machinability attributes and can therefore readily be welded, cut,drilled, threaded, stamped or the like as may be desired to produce a high quality finished product.<br>
Thus, while the principles of the invention have now been made clear in illustrative embodiments, there will be immediately obvious to the those skilled in the art many modifications of Structure and components used in the practice of the invention which are particuiarly adapted for specific environments and operating requirements without departing from those principles.<br><br><br>
