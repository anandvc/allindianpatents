				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates a novel synergistic composition useful as paint and varnish remover from solid surfaces and a process for preparing the said composition.<br>
In our day-day life paints and varnishes are used as surface coatings on furniture and other appliances , automobiles . With prolong use the painted surface in contact with ambient air, degrades and losses luster decor and protective qualities. This necessitates the removal of the damaged coatings to enable fresh application of paints and varnishes on surface of the articles. In the present invention, a viscous composition has been developed which is useful for the removal of organic coatings such as paints and varnishes. Besides the utility of the invention in the paint removal from permanent fixtures and even as a emulsion paint remover , the invention has<br>
wide spectrum of use in the field of automobile and other industrial sectors.<br>
Scrubbing or burning methods have been, in general, employed for the removal of paint and varnish. In the scrubbing case, mechanical pressure is required in the absence of which it is difficult to remove the paint from the unapproachable sides viz. corners and the angles of the permanent fixures. Burning process, on the other hand, emits gases like CC^, CO and hydrocarbons leading to the environmental hazards. Ketones.esters and aromatic hydrocarbons have been the earliest materials used as solvents to dissolve paints and varnishes from the solid surfaces.. They, however, possess flammable and carcinogenic characteristics. Also the methylene chloride has been considered as the most effective solvent used for the removal of paint and varnish. Polar nature and small molecular size of this solvent.however, limits it's use as it can penetrate the coating surface rapidly and thereby degrade the base layer.which is an undesirable chartacteristic of the chemical.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel composition useful for<br>
removing organic coatings from solid surfaces and a process for preparing the said<br>
composition which obviates the drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is in the use of such chemicals in the said<br>
composition which are easily available and may be of commercial grade and are eco-<br>
friendly.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is the easy applicability of the composition on<br>
any inner unapproachable parts such as corners, angles, vertical surfaces, by methods<br>
such as spraying, brushing or by simple dipping.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel<br>
synergistic composition useful as paint and varnish remover from solid surface  which<br>
comprises mixing 70 wt% to 80 wt% non-inflammable methylene chloride and 5 wt% to<br>
20 wt% polar co-solvent, mixing 1 wt% to 3 wt% organic acid activators under constant<br>
stirring to the mixture so obtained, mixing under constant stirring 1 wt% co-activators<br>
such as inorganic acid along with 1 wt% 5 wt% substituted phenol, adding the resultant<br>
mixture under constant stirring to 2 wt% to 3 wt%    molten corrosion inhibitor and<br>
evaporation retarder, adding 1 wt% to 2 wt% thickener under stirring to the mixture so<br>
obtained, adding 1 wt% to 3 wt% of wetting agent and emulsifier to the resultant mixture<br>
under constant stirring to obtain the novel composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the organic polar co solvent used may be<br>
such as trichloroethylene, methanol, benzene.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, activator used may be organic acid<br>
such as formic acid, acetic acid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the co-activator used may be<br>
inorganic acid such as hypophosphorous acid, perchloric acid alongwith substituted<br>
phenol such as xyelene, toluene.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention.the corrosion inhibitor and evaporation retarder used may be such as paraffin wax. .<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention.the thickner used may be such as colloidal silica, methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethylcellulose, starch.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the wetting agent and emulsifier used may be anionic detergents such as metal and amine soaps.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention all ingredients used may be of commercial grade.<br>
The novel composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having properties which are not a mere aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel composition useful for removing organic coatings , which comprises: mixing 70 wt% to 80 wt% non-flammable methylene chloride and 5 wt% to 20 wt% polar co-solvent, mixing 1 wt% to3 wt% organic acid activators under constant stirring to the mixture so obtained, mixing under constant stirring 1wt%-3wt% co-activators such as inorganic acid alongwith 1 wt% 5 wt% substituted phenol , adding the resultant mixture under constant stirring to 2 wt% to 3 wt% molten corrosion inhibitor and evaporation retarder, adding 1 wt% to 2 wt% thickner under stirring to the mixture so obtained , adding 1 wt% to 3 wt% of wetting agent and emulsifier to the resultant mixture under constant stirring to obtain the novel composition.<br>
Preparation of the composition initially involves combining 70-80 cc of methylene chloride with 5 to 20 cc. of trichloroethylene which helps in raising the boiling point and the rate of stripping of the of the mixed chemicals<br>
besides decreasing the solubility of other additives. 1 to 3 cc. of formic acid or acetic acid is then added which in a way is responsible for the removal of paint film quickly. This is followed by the addition of hypophosphorous acid in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 cc. alongwith 0.1-0.5 cc. of xylene.The resulting mixture thus obtained is acidic and so the corrosion inhibitors like paraffin wax after melting the wax, in the quantities of 2 to 3 gms. have been added to prohibit the surface corrosion of the end use material. The function of the paraffin wax is dual in that it also acts as an evaporation retarder. In the subsequent step, a suitable thickner say methyl cellulose in the range of 1 to 2 cc. has been incorporated to the mixture for ease of application on vertical surfaces. Finally, anionic detergents such as metal and amine soaps in quantities of 1 to 2 gms. are added to the resultant mixture for the purpose of assistance in the removal of softened paint thereby providing a synergistic composition useful as paint, varnish and emulsion paint remover.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the   invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
70 cc. of methylene chloride (commercial grade) has been first mixed with 5 cc. of trichloroethylene . To this mixture, 1cc. of formic acid is added and is stirred continuously, followed by the addition of 0.1 cc. of hypophosphorous acid alongwith 0.1 cc. of xylene.The mixture is stirred continuosly to get a homogeneous solution. Next, 2 gms. paraffin wax is molten in a beaker to which is added the previous mixture and the final mixture so obtained is stirred continuously to ensure complete mixing of the wax in the mixture. 1 cc. of methyl cellulose has been incorporated in the subsequent step. Finally, 1 gm of metal and amine soaps is added to the resultant mixture thereby providing the novel composition for end use.<br>
Example 2<br>
75 cc. of methylene chloride (commercial grade) has been first mixed with 10 cc. of trichloroethylene.To this mixture, 2 cc. of formic acid is added and is stirred continuously followed by the addition of 0.3 cc. of hypophosphorous acid alongwith 0.3 cc. of xylene.The mixture is stirred continuosly to get a homogeneous solution. Next, 2 gms. paraffin wax is molten in a beaker to which is added the previous mixture and the final mixture so obtained is stirred continuously to ensure complete mixing of the wax in the mixture. 2 cc. of methyl cellulose has been incorporated in the subsequent step. Finally, 2 gms. of metal and amine soaps is added to the resultant mixture thereby providing the novel composition for end use.<br>
Novelty of the present invention is in providing a novel composition in fluid or paste form which allows easy application thus avoiding mechanical means to remove damaged surface coatings and instead make use of a simple application of the present synergistic composition foloowed by simple rubbing.<br>
