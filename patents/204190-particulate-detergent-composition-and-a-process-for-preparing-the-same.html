DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD 5<br>
The present invention relates to particulate detergent compositions containing the sequestrant, iminodisuccinate or hydroxyiminodisuccinate.  The invention is of especially interest for detergent powders of high bulk density (so-10  called "compact" powders) and to tablets of compacted<br>
detergent powder.   The invention is especially applicable to laundry detergent powders but is also relevant to powders or tablets for mechanical dishwashing.<br>
15<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Iminodisuccinate (IDS) and hydroxyiminodisuccinate (HIDS) are known as detergency builders and, in bleaching detergent 20  compositions, as stabilisers for peroxy bleach precursors.<br>
US 3 697 453 (Pfizer) discloses detergent compositions having a pH of from 9 to 12, containing iminodisuccinate as a detergency builder, used together with detergent 25  surfactant in a weight ratio of 0.25:1 to 10:1.   IDS as a detergency builder is also disclosed in EP 757 094A (Bayer). HIDS is disclosed in US 5 318 726 (Henkel) .<br>
EP 50 9 3 82A (W R Grace &amp; Co/Hampshire Chemical Corporation) 30  discloses a bleaching detergent composition comprising a bleaching agent and a bleach stabiliser of defined formula<br>
2<br><br><br>
03 97 6<br>
which includes IDS. The use of IDS as a bleach stabiliser is also disclosed in WO 97 20907A (Procter &amp; Gamble).<br>
WO 00/34427A (Unilever) discloses and claims non-bleaching 5  laundry detergent compositions containing from 0.05 to<br>
2.5 wt% of IDS or HIDS. The compositions provides improved maintenance and/or restoration of colour fidelity during the wash, especially at low wash pH.   The IDS or HIDS is also an effective chlorine scavenger, reducing the in-wash fading 10  of chlorine-sensitive dyes.  In addition, the incorporation of the IDS or HIDS improves the stain removal performance of the composition.<br>
IDS is commercially available in sodium salt form, eg as IDS 15  Na-salt from Bayer.  The sodium salt is highly water-soluble and the material is supplied as an aqueous solution (approximate IDS Na-salt content 34%) and as a solid white powder prepared from the solution by spray-drying. If IDS is to be incorporated into an aqueous liquid<br>
2	0  detergent or into a spray-dried detergent powder via the<br>
slurry, the solution form is most conveniently used. However, it is not suitable for the preparation of a powder of high bulk density by a non-tower (non-spray-drying) route because the water content is too high.  For such products it 25  is necessary to use IDS in powder form.<br>
However, the powder is extremely hygroscopic and, according to the manufacturer Bayer's recommendation, must be stored in tightly closed containers.  If stored in contact with the<br>
3	0  atmosphere it rapidly takes up water and deliquesces, ie<br>
becomes a liquid.  The problem is exacerbated in humid<br>
3<br><br><br>
03976<br><br>
atmospheres so that any storage or handling of the material causes major problems with stickiness.  When this sticky raw material is incorporated into a detergent powder, poor powder properties result. 5<br>
It has now been found that this problem can be substantially alleviated by converting the IDS partially into calcium or magnesium form, ie forming complexes with calcium or magnesium ions.  The resulting Ca/Na or Mg/Na salts or<br>
10  complexes, especially the Ca/Na salts or complexes, are<br>
stable solids which are significantly less hygroscopic than the sodium salt.   They can readily be incorporated into particulate detergent compositions and, surprisingly, the resulting compositions show no loss of sequestrant activity<br>
15  as compared with similar compositions containing the sodium salt.<br>
GB 2 048 930A (Unilever) discloses bleaching detergent compositions containing an organic phosphonate sequestrant<br>
20  -  ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) or diethylenetriamine pentamethylene phosphonate (DETPMP) present as a complex of a magnesium, calcium, zinc or aluminium ion, the molar ratio of the metal ion to the phosphonate compound being at least 1:1.   The benefit is<br>
25  improved stability of the phosphonate compound in the detergent composition on storage.<br>
JP  09 110 813A and JP 09 104 897A (Nippon Shokubai) disclose a builder powder of reduced hygroscopicity based on 30  IDS, in which sodium IDS is compounded with an inorganic<br><br>
4 <br>
03976<br><br>
metal salt, preferably zeolite, sodium carbonate or sodium silicate.<br>
JP 09 100 497A (Lion) discloses high bulk density detergent 5  powders containing IDS, prepared by granulating together detergent ingredients including an inorganic builder salt, eg zeolite, and sodium IDS or HIDS (3-20 wt% of the final composition).   The hygroscopicity of the. IDS is exploited to bind fine zeolite particles and thereby improve flow- and 10  reduce stickiness.<br>
B Karoleski and R Hampe of Bayer Corporation, in a paper entitled "Alternatives to Traditional Chelants and Dispersants", HAPPI (Household and Personal Products<br>
15  Industry), Volume 36, No. 11 (November 1999), pages 114 -118, discuss the sequestrant properties of IDS.  The stability constants of complexes with various divalent and polyvalent metal ions, including calcium and magnesium, are disclosed.<br>
20<br>
DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a particulate detergent 25  composition containing a sequestrant which is a compound of the formula I<br>
30 <br><br>
5 <br>
C3976<br><br>
wherein Y is H or OH, and X is a countercation, the compound being in the form of a complex of a metal ion selected from calcium and magnesium ions, the molar ratio of the metal ion to the compound of the formula I being at 5  least 2:1.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a particulate detergent composition, which includes the step of mixing and/or granulating a compound of the formula<br>
10  I in powder form with other detergent ingredients, wherein the compound of the formula I is in the form of a complex of a metal ion selected from calcium and magnesium ions, the molar ratio of the metal ion to the compound of the formula I being at least 2:1.<br>
15<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The IDS or HIPS salt or complex<br>
20<br>
The detergent composition of the invention contains a compound of the formula I above as an essential ingredient. When Y is H, the compound is IDS;  when Y is OH, the compound is HIDS.  For convenience only IDS will be<br>
25  discussed in the description below, but this should be understood to refer equally to HIDS.<br>
IDS is a pentadentate ligand ie it can form complexes with metal ions in.which bonds are formed with the nitrogen atom 30  and all four carboxyl groups.  Indeed its efficacy as a detergency builder is based on its capacity to form such<br><br>
6 <br>
complexes with calcium and magnesium ions, and its efficacy as a bleach stabiliser and for colour care is based on its capacity for forming such complexes with heavy metal ions such as iron and copper. 5<br>
The reaction between an iminodisuccinate acid anion IDSm" and a metal cation Men+ is a reversible one, represented in the usual case of a 1:1 complex by the equation<br>
0  IDSm-  +  Men+    IDS Me (m"n) "<br>
Similar relationships hold for 2:1, 3:1 and higher complexes (the ratio being of the metal ion to the IDS anion).<br>
5  The present inventors have surprisingly found that IDS in the form of a 2:1 or higher complex with calcium or magnesium is substantially less hygroscopic than the sodium salt.<br>
0  The calcium complexes are especially preferred, more<br>
especially complexes having a Ca:IDS molar ratio of 2:1 or above, for example, 2:1 or 3:1.  The 1:1 complex is also less hygroscopic than the sodium salt, but the benefit is significantly greater with the higher ratio complexes.  The<br>
5  3:1 complex is especially preferred.<br>
The magnesium complexes are also useful but the benefit observed is less than with the calcium complexes.<br>
0  The calcium or magnesium complexes may be prepared by reacting the sodium salt, in aqueous solution, with the<br><br>
7 <br>
03976<br><br>
appropriate amount of a soluble calcium or magnesium salt, preferably calcium or magnesium chloride.  The reaction also produces a soluble inorganic sodium salt (eg sodium chloride). 5<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the soluble inorganic sodium salt produced as a by-product of the preparation process is removed by using a filtration step.  Where this is possible, a further significant<br>
10  reduction of hygroscopicity has been observed.   However, it is only possible if there is sufficient difference in solubility between the complex and the inorganic salt by¬product, which is highly soluble.  The higher the mole ratio of the complex, the lower its solubility, and the 1:1<br>
15  complexes of both calcium and magnesium are both too soluble to allow separation of the sodium chloride by-product.  With the 2:1 complexes partial separation is possible and this gives some improvement.<br>
20  However, the CalDS and CaHIDS 3:1 complexes are especially preferred in this respet because thie solubility is " sufficiently reduced, compared with that of the sodium salt,<br>
to alToV'sodium chloride to be separated by fiitration<br>
during their preparation, yet is sufficiently high for'these<br>
25  materials to be delivered effectively into the wash liquor.<br>
Thus, an especially preferred embodiment of the invention involves the use of a CalDS or CaHIDS 3:1 complex which has been prepared by a method which includes removal of any 30  inorganic salt by-product.<br><br>
8 <br>
03976<br><br>
Detergent compositions<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention contain IDS (or 5  HIDS) as an essential ingredient.  This may be present at levels sufficient for detergency building, either alone or in conjunction with another detergency builder, or at the much lower levels appropriate for bleach stabilisation, or for colour care benefits and stain removal in non-bleaching 10  formulations as disclosed in WO 00/34427A (Unilever).<br>
The amount of IDS or HIDS present in the composition may<br>
therefore range very widely, for example, from 0.05 to<br>
80 wt%.   Suitable ranges are, for example, 5 to 80 wt% if<br>
15  IDS is the sole or principal builder;  1 to 20 wt% if it is present as cobuilder to, for example, zeolite, phosphate or carbonate;  0.5 to 10 wt% for bleach stabilisation;  0.05 to 2.5 wt% for colour care benefits in non-bleaching formulations.<br>
20<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain other conventional detergent ingredients as detailed below. Typically a composition in which IDS is present as a co¬builder or a bleach stabiliser may comprise the following:<br>
25<br>
(a)	from 5 to 60 wt% of one or more detergent surfactants,<br>
(b)	from 10 to 80 wt% of one or more detergency builders (other than IDS),<br>
30<br>
(c)	from 0.5 to 20 wt% of a compound of the formula I,<br><br>
9 <br>
03976<br><br><br><br>
(d)  optionally other detergent ingredients to 100 wt%.<br>
A non-bleaching formulation in which a low level of IDS has 5  been included for colour care benefits may suitably comprise:<br>
(a)  from 5 to 60 wt% of one or more detergent surfactants,<br>
10  (b)  from 10 to 80 wt% of one or more detergency builders (other than IDS),<br>
(c)  from 0.05 to 2.5 wt% of a compound of the formula I,<br>
15  (d)  optionally other non-bleaching detergent ingredients to 100 wt%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The detergent composition of the invention is in\particulate<br>
form.  The invention is especially applicable to powders 'of 20  high bulk density, and to tablets prepared by compacting<br>
powder.  In these products the use of a hygroscopic material would be especially problematic.<br>
If in powder form, the composition of the invention     25  preferably has a bulk density of at least 500 g/1, and<br>
preferably from 600 to 1000 g/1, more preferably from 800 to<br>
1000 g/1 	<br><br>
However, the invention is also applicable to powders of 3 0  lower bulk density.  In such a product, for example, the IDS complex may be in admixture mixed with a spray-dried<br><br>
10 <br>
03976<br>
detergent base powder and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also be in tablet 5  form.<br>
While the invention is primarily applicable to laundry detergent compositions, it is also relevant to mechanical dishwashing detergents, both powders and tablets, containing 10  IDS.<br>
Preparation of the detergent composition<br>
15  As indicated previously, the invention is especially<br>
applicable to particulate detergent compositions of high bulk density.  Such compositions may be prepared by non-tower (non-spray-drying) processes in which particulate raw materials are mixed and/or granulated.   According to the<br>
20  invention, to prepare compositions of this type the IDS complex is mixed and/or granulated with other detergent ingredients.  The mixing and/or granulation may suitably be carried out in a high-speed mixer/granulator, for example a Fukae (Trade Mark) FSG mixer or a Lgedige Recycler (Trade<br>
25  Mark).<br>
The invention is also applicable to detergent powders of lower bulk density.  For example, a detergent base powder may be prepared by conventional slurry-making and spray-drying processes, and other ingredients in powder form,<br>
30  including the IDS complex in accordance with the present invention, may be admixed (postdosed) to the base powder.<br><br><br>
11 <br>
03976<br><br>
The availability of IDS in a non-hygroscopic powder form adds further flexibility in the manufacture of detergent powders, and is especially valuable where different products of different bulk densities are manufactured on the same 5  site.<br>
Tablets may be prepared by compacting powders containing the IDS complex.<br>
10<br>
Detergent components<br>
The compositions of the invention also contain other conventional detergent ingredients.  Essential ingredients<br>
15  are su-r.factants (detergent-act ive_co.mpounds) and (unless IDS is the sole builder) detergency builders.<br>
The detergent, compositions will contain, as essential ing-r.edients, one or more detergent active compounds<br>
2 0  (surfactants) which may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds, and mixtures thereof. Many suitable detergent active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in<br>
25  "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred detergent active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and nonionic 3 0  compounds.<br><br><br>

Q3976<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of CaIDS and MgIDS<br>
5  An 0.04M aqueous solution of NalDS (ex Bayer) was prepared and the pH adjusted to 12 with 1M NaOH solution.  CaCl2 or MgCl2 solution was added slowly while stirring to give a final mole ratio of Ca or Mg to IDS of 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1. A white precipitate formed with slow addition of the Ca or<br>
10  Mg salt solution.  In the case of low mole ratios of Ca or Mg.-IDS the precipitate formed but then re-dissolved. The Mg:IDS also formed a thicker, more gelatinous precipitate than Ca:IDS.  After the required amount of Ca or Mg chloride salt solution had been added, the pH was re-adjusted back to<br>
15  12.  The dry salt was obtained by collecting the total liquor and precipitate and freeze drying.<br>
Water uptake measurements<br>
20<br>
The dry salt was ground up using a mortar and pestle. The dry salt was sieved to obtain a fraction with constant size and therefore constant surface area.  The size fraction 355-500 micrometres was selected as being a representative<br>
25  portion of normal detergent powders.  Approximately 1 g portions of these sieved Ca:IDS and Mg:IDS powders were weighed out into plastic dishes.  These open dishes were stored in a humidity cabinet at 20°C/75% RH, the relative humidity being generated by an atmosphere of saturated NaCl<br>
30  (~ 6M) .<br><br><br>
20 <br>
O3976<br><br>
The dishes were re-weighed periodically over a period of 7 days' storage under these conditions, and the % water uptake was calculated.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of CalDS 3:1 complex<br>
This Example shows the benefit of separating the sodium 5  chloride formed as a by-product.  The procedure was<br>
generally similar to that of Example 1, but with an added filtration step.<br>
A 0.04M solution of NalDS was prepared and the pH adjusted 10  to 12 with 1M NaOH solution.   0.12M CaCl2 solution was added slowly while stirring, to give a final mole ratio of 3:1 Ca:IDS).  A white precipitate formed with slow addition of the Ca salt solution.  After the required amount of Ca salt solution had been added, the pH was re-adjusted back to 12. 15<br>
The slurry obtained was filtered under vacuum through a 542 filter paper fitted to a Buchner funnel.  This removed the majority of the NaCl generated during the reaction of NalDS with CaCl2. The filter cake was dried in an oven overnight at 20  120°C.<br>
Water take-up of this material, and of a control sample prepared without a filtration step, was measured as in Example 1 and the results were as shown below.<br><br><br>

21 days	55.73	16.06<br>
5  Both samples remained as powders throughout the storage<br>
period.  The sample prepared without filtration showed some slight stickiness after 21 days, although not earlier, while the sample prepared with a filtration step was completely free-flowing even after 21 days' storage.<br>

The very low water uptake figures for the 3:1 CalDS without NaCl will be noted.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
5  3:1 CaHIDS complexes were prepared by the procedures<br>
described in Example 1 (without filtration) and Example 2 (with filtration). The starting NaHIDS was ex Nippon Shokubai.<br>
10  The water uptake results were as follows:<br><br>
Storage Time	% Water uptake (at 20°C/75% RH)<br><br>
	NaHIDS	CaHIDS (3:1) + NaCl	CaHIDS (3:1) minus NaCl<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Detergent composition<br>
A particulate detergent composition was prepared by a 5  conventional slurry-making and spray-drying process to the following formulation:<br><br>
	wt%<br>
Sodium linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (NaLAS)	22.92<br>
Sodium silicate (anhydrous)	5.37<br>
Sodium tripolyphosphate	18.67<br>
Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose	0.25<br>
Polyacrylate polymer	0.70<br>
Calcite	10.00<br>
Sodium sulphate, fluorescer, water, impurities	to 100<br>
Sample, preparation and storage<br>
50 g samples of the detergent base powder were weighed into<br>
glass jars, and 1.25% by weight IDS or HIDS salt (180-250 15  microns sieve fraction) were added.   The jars were sealed,<br>
and the detergent powder thoroughly mixed with the IDS or<br>
HIDS on a roller mixer for 1 hour.<br>
The contents of each jar were then transferred to open<br>
cardboard trays, and stored for a period of 7 days in a 20  controlled temperature/humidity store, (37°C/70% RH).<br>
The powders were re-weighed periodically and % water uptake<br>
calculated.<br><br>
26 <br>
O3976<br><br>
Example 4a<br>
Water uptake measurements (detergent powder + IDS):<br><br>
Storage Time	% Water uptake (at 37°C/70% RH)<br><br>
	No sequestrant	NalDS 1.25%	CalDS (3:1,<br>
minus NaCl) 1.25%<br>
2 hours	2.69	3.12	3.20<br>
7 days	4.10	6.07	4.98<br>

Water uptake measurements (detergent powder + HIPS):<br><br>

	No sequestrant	NaHIDS 1.25%	CaHIDS (3:1,<br>
minus NaCl) 1.25%<br>
2 hours	2.69	3.09	2.90<br>
7 days	4.10	5.48	4.96<br>
10  Incorporation of NalDS or NaHIDS into detergent powder compositions resulted in increased water uptake of the detergent powders on storage as these materials are hygroscopic.  This gave rise to increased stickiness of powders especially on storage.  Use of the Ca form of IDS or<br>
27 <br>
03976<br>
HIDS lowered the level of water uptake minimising any negatives' on powder physical properties.<br>
5  Measurement of caking<br>
For measurement of caking, homogeneous samples of the stored detergent powders were first obtained by roller mixing in sealed glass jars for 1 hour.<br>
10<br>
Compression and caking were measured using an apparatus comprising a graduated open-ended perspex cylinder of height 8 0 mm and internal diameter 24 mm standing on an aluminium base plate and fitted at its upper end with a plunger having<br>
15  a large flat circular top on which cylindrical weights could be placed.<br>
The cylinder was filled with powder to a height of 30 mm, the plunger inserted until just touching the top of the<br>
2 0  powder, and a 1 kg weight placed on the top of the plunger. The weight was removed after 2 minutes, and the the compression of the powder sample (the fall in its level, in mm) was measured using the graduations on the cylinder and recorded.<br>
25<br>
The resulting "cake" of powder was expelled from the lower end of the cylinder, by means of the plunger, onto the base plate.  20g weights were added to the top of the powder cake until the cake disintegrated, and the total weight required<br>
30	to break up the cake (the unconfined compression test score or UCT, in g) was recorded.<br>
28<br><br><br>
03*976<br><br>
Higher UCT values were obtained when a higher level of compression was achieved, ie the "powder cakes" were stronger.  Increased compression and higher UCT values were also generally linked to increased water uptake.<br>
Example 4c<br>
Measurement of caking (detergent powder + IDS):<br><br>
	Stored detergent powders (7 days at 37°C/70% RH - open trays)<br><br>
	No sequestrant	NaIDS 1.25%	CaIDS 3:1 (minus NaCl) 1.25%<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
Colour care performance of CaIDS and CaHIDS in detergent powders:  restoration/recovery of coloured fabrics that have been colour-damaged by exposure to copper ions 5<br>
These experiments demonstrate that the benefits of IDS and HIDS in restoring colour-damaged coloured fabrics are retained if the IDS or HIDS is used in the form of a Ca complex.<br>
10<br>
The fabrics used were cotton dyed with Direct Red 80.   They were pre-treated with demineralised water containing 0.5 ppm Cu2+ ions and having the pH adjusted to 6.5 by means of sodium hydroxide.  The pretreatment was carried out using<br>
15  tergotometers at 30°C, 90 rpm and a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1, then the fabrics were line dried.<br>
The fabrics were then washed in a wash liquor containing 2.5 g/1 of the detergent composition (as used above), and<br>
2 0  0.5 ppm Cu2+, in 2 0/6° Ca/Mg French hard water:  the pH was adjusted from 9.9 to 9.5 using dilute sulphuric acid.   The washes were carried out in tergotometers at 3 0°C, 90 rpm and a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1.   The washes were followed by two rinses in 20/6° Ca/Mg French hard water containing<br>
25  0.05 ppm Cu2+ at a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1, and the fabrics were then line dried.<br>
The sequestrants, where present, were dosed directly into the wash liquor in amounts to give the equivalent of 1.25% 30  (by weight on the detergent composition) of NaIDS or NaHIDS.<br>
30 <br>
03976<br><br><br>
Colour changes were monitored by reflectance changes at 620 nm, the standard being the fabrics prior to pretreatment.  All values were negative, the ideal being the smallest possible negative value.  Colour changes were also 5  recorded as degree or % recovery of copper damaged coloured fabrics, ie  as a  %  of the maximum possible  recovery.<br>
The results are shown in the Tables below.<br>
10  No significant differences in performance were observed<br>
between the NaIDS and the CaIDS.  These results show that there is no loss of colour care performance in the wash if IDS is incorporated as a Ca complex.<br>
