DETAILED   DESCHPTION   WITH   REFENCE   TO   THE   ACOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
According to the invention, there is provided an arrangement for a safety door. Referring to figure 1 and 2, a switch board (6) is connected to UPS (2). Said UPS (-ve) is connected to push button (1) through secret<br>
button (12) and buzzer switch (10) and said UPS (+ve) is connected to timer (3), buzzer (4) and motor (5), The push button (-ve) is connected to motor (5). The motor (-ve) is connected to a push button (15) provided near to the motor to switch it off. The buzzer switch (-ve) is connected to inner and outer buzzer through timer. The secret button (-ve) is connected to dummy secret button (12A) and the dummy secret button (-ve) is connected to the motor. All the connecting wires are provided through the pipes in the wall. As shown in the figure 3, the locker of an almirah is provided with a push button, first lock and another lock at its lower portion. Further, the locker is provided with a small cover to cover first lock and push button. When the push button is covered with the cover, the push button remains switched off. However, when the cover is opened the switch button gets switched on and the motor gets activated. With the start of the motor the pulley (17) attached with the motor starts working and pushes the slider (3') backward. The slider (3) is attached to a supporting means (13) and frame (14), With the back movement of slider, supporting means also moves back with it and presses a push button (15) so as to switch off the motor. A hammer (11) resting on the supporting means becomes free with the back movement of the supporting means and falls down to hit lower extended portion (8A) of a<br>
movable rod (7). With the hitting, the movable rod (7) moves round through 90Â°. So that, the grill (9) resting on upper extended portion (8) of movable rod gets free and falls down to close the door with the heavy alarming sound. The alarming sound is produced by buzzer switch (10) which gets switch on with the fall of the hammer. In the absence of the electric current UPS issued as a substitute to activate the motor. Within 2 3 seconds of activation of the motor, the grill closes the door. The secret button is put at a secret and safe place in a house and its location can be changed easily. However, for personal use of the almirah the secret button can be switched off. Further, the dummy secret button is provided which is antagonist the role of secret button i.e. the dummy secret button can be switched on instead of switching off the secret button to misguide the wrong doers and catch them. The secret buttons can be put anywhere like behind any photo frame, behind any mirror, under any carpet etc. However, any number of secret buttons can be provided.<br>
If this secret button is switched off then the motor doesn't work as current can't reach to push button. However, to serve the purpose another lock is provided.<br>
For the provision of another lock there is provided a groove in the bottom portion of the locker and a small box (B1) which is attached to a soft wire is accommodated inside the groove. The soft wire/cable is connected to the slider (3'j. The lock is locked from below of the locker and in the locking form the box remains engaged with the door of the locker.<br>
So that when the door of the locker is pulled after unlocking the first lock, the slider gets pulled with the wire to move back and the grill falls down with the heavy alarming sound so as to catch the wrong doers. To hide the lock, the door of the locker extends down.<br>
In the absence of electricity particularly in the rural area to put a check on the theft another arrangement has been made which has been shown in figures 6 and 7. In this arrangement the hammer rests on the slider (3') attached with a soft wire (Wi) to any means such as back of the photo frame, mirror, regulator or any almirah etc. With the pulling of the means the hammer falls down and the grill closes the door as described hereinabpve but, without any buzz. In this arrangement frame (14), slider (3') hammer (11), movable rod (7), grill (9) and lock system (18) are provided.<br>
The grill is held by an angle through nuts and bolts. The lock system (18) as shown in the figure (4) is provided with middle sheet (P1) connected to two iron rods (R1 to R4) on both sides and a spring (S1) is connected to the rod at one end and to the bottom of the framef at the other end. When the grill comes down then the same gets into the grooves of the pipe provided on both sides and the two end rods (R1 and R4) get into the groove at the bottom to lock the door. The door can be unlocked by unlocking the lock (16). The lock system is covered by cover and is connected to the grill by a means of bolts and nuts.<br>
The arrangement provided at the top of the door is covered with a metal cover which is provided with a small cover at the top. Under the small cover a push button connected with the motor is provided which remains switched off with the closure of the cover. However, when the cover is opened the push button gets switched on and activates the motor to serve the purpose. With this, it is possible to check the theft if anybody tries to damage the arrangement.<br>
To put an efficient check on the dacoity etc, the floor can be provided with the arrangement as shown in the figure 5 and 5A to 5C. Figure 5 indicates the overall arrangement of the wooden ply floor connected to a plug through wire which can be covered by carpet. Figure 5A shows inside of upper ply (A) which comprises conductor in the form of saw tooth for proper contact, nut bolt and spring at the corners and connected to the motor. Figure 5B indicates up side portion of lower Ply (B) which comprises conductor on its four sides and nut bolt at its center and the same is connected to the main switch board and UPS to get the supply of electric current. Figure 5C indicates down side portion of lower ply (B) which comprises conductor, nut and bolts and elastic insulator. Ply (A) is put on ply (B). when anybody steps on the wooden ply floor then the conductor of ply (A) comes in contact with the conductors provided on the up side portion of ply B and the current goes to the motor to close the door, However, when any wrong doer tries to lift the ply floor then the conductor on down side portion of ply B comes in contact with the nut and bolt a_t the middle of upper part of ply B so as to activate the motor to serve the purpose as described herein above. Ply (A) is fixed with ply (B) by means of nut, bolts and spring.<br>
From the above description, it is clear that, the instant invention provides an efficient way to check theft, dacoity, burglary etc, The main advantage is that, the invention can work with and without electricity. Hence, in rural areas also the arrangement can be adapted without any difficulty.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modification, changes and adaptations in actual practice. Such variant embodiments incorporating the concepts and features of the present invention, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br>
