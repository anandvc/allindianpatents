STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
This invention is based on an efficient treatment of Diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is neuropathic disorders that are associated with mellitus. These are compounds are useful for the treatment of Diabetic neuropathy<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention is based on an efficient treatment of Diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is neuropathic disorders that are associated with diabetes mellitus. These conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum).Diabetic neuropathy includes third nerve palsy, mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painfiil polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy.<br>
Diabetic neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves: pain fibers, motor neurons, autonomic nerves. It therefore necessarily can affect all organs and systems since all are innervated. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems and members affected, but these are by no means exclusive. A patient can have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination.<br>
Symptoms vary depending on the nerve affected and may include symptoms other than those listed. Symptoms usually develop gradually over years.<br>
Treatment of diabetic neuropathy using combined administration of a formulation including as an active ingredient, antioxidant with an anti-diabetic agent in order to improve nerve conduction velocities. Suitable anti- diabetic agents.<br>
Symptoms may include:<br>
•	Numbness and tingling of extremities<br>
•	Dysesthesia (decreased or loss of sensation to a body part)<br>
•	Diarrhea<br>
•	Erectile dysfunction<br>
•	Urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control)<br>
•	Impotence<br>
•	Facial, mouth and eyelid drooping<br>
•	Vision changes<br>
•	Dizziness<br>
•	Muscle weakness<br>
•	Difficulty swallowing<br>
•	Speech impairment<br>
•	Fascicuiation (muscle contractions)<br>
•	Anorgasmia<br>
•	Burning or electric pain<br>
Some reasons for neuropathy<br>
In all forms of neuropathy, there is abnormal stimulation of nerves or damage that results in pain. Peripheral nerves are sensitive conduits that carry impulses from the extremities back to the central nervous system (i.e.. the spinal cord and brain). Impulses are transmitted along nerves by changes in the electrical charge of the cell membrane caused by movement of ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. Impulses are transmitted between nerves by neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and substance P, which is responsible for transmitting pain impulses. For protection, most nerves are covered with a thin sheath called myelin, which is made from choline and lipids. The myelin functions like the rubber wrapping around an electrical cord: it insulates the nerve fibers and prevents abnormal transmissions.<br>
In diabetic neuropathy, for example, there is a change in the microvascular network that supplies the nerve with nutrients. This lack of blood supply and nutrients causes the nerve to function abnormally. Diabetic neuropathy tends to occur in more than one nerve area (this condition is called polyneuropathy) and may cause loss of sensation and pain that typically worsens at night. In severe cases, diabetics can suffer from a kind of neuropathy called autonomic neuropathy. In this case, the autonomic nervous system, which controls automatic body functions, is affected with possibly serious consequences, including gastrointestinal problems, bladder-emptying problems, abnormal heart rhythms, and even sudden death (El-Atat FA et al 2004).<br>
Effects on nerve types<br>
Different nerves are affected in different ways<br>
Sensorimotor poly neuropathy<br>
Longer nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones, because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length. In this syndrome, decreased sensation and loss of reflexes occurs first in the toes on each foot, then extends upward. It is usually described as glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, dysesthesia and night time pain. The pain can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull. Pins and needles sensation is common. Loss of proprioception, the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. These patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are developing a callous from an ill-fitting shoe. Consequently, they are at risk for developing ulcers and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to amputation. Similarly, these patients can get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint. Loss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, contractures of the toes, loss of the interosseous muscle function and leads to contraction of the digits, so called hammer toes. These contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand where the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal. The loss of muscular function is progressive.<br>
Autonomic neuropathy<br>
The autonomic nervous system is composed of nerves serving the heart, gastrointestinal system and genitourinary system. Autonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems. The most commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetics is orthostatic hypotension, or fainting when standing up. In the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, it is due to the failure of the heart and arteries to appropriately adjust heart rate and vascular tone to keep blood continually and fully flowing to the brain. This symptom is usually accompanied by a loss of the usual change in heart rate seen with normal breathing. These two findings suggest autonomic neuropathy.<br>
GI tract manifestations include gastroparesis, nausea, bloating, and diarrhea. Because many diabetics take oral medication for their diabetes, absorption of these medicines is greatly affected by the delayed gastric emptying. This can lead to hypoglycemia when an oral diabetic agent is taken before a meal and does not get absorbed until hours, or sometimes days later, when there is normal or low blood sugar already. Sluggish movement of the small intestine can cause bacterial overgrowth, made worse by the presence of hyperglycemia. This leads to bloating, gas and diarrhea.<br>
Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and retention. Again, because of the retention of urine, urinary tract infections are frequent. Urinary retention can lead to bladder diverticula, stones, reflux nephropathy.<br>
Cranial neuropathy<br>
When cranial nerves are affected, oculomotor (3rd) neuropathies are most common. The oculomotor nerve controls all of the muscles that move the eye with the exception of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. It also serves to constrict the pupil and open the eyelid. The onset of a diabetic third nerve palsy is usually abrupt, beginning with frontal or periorbital pain and then diplopia. All of the oculomotor muscles innervated by the third nerve may be affected, but those that control pupil size are usually well-preserved early on. This is because the parasympathetic nerve fibers within CNIII that influence pupillary size are found on the periphery of the nerve (in terms of a cross sectional view), which makes them less susceptible to ischemic damage (as they are closer to the vascular supply). The sixth ne.ve, the abducens nerve, which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye (moves the eye laterally), is also commonly affected but fourth nerve, the trochlear nerve, (innervates the superior oblique muscle, which moves the eye downward) involvement is unusual. Mononeuropathies of the thoracic or lumbar spinal nerves can occur and lead to painful syndromes that mimic myocardial infarction, cholecystitis or appendicitis. Diabetics have a higher incidence of entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. <br>
Diagnosis<br>
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is the most likely diagnosis for someone with diabetes who has pain in a leg or foot, although it may also be caused by vitamin B12  deficiency or osteoarthritis<br>
The treatment of Diathetic neuropathy by the combination of following three compounds like taurine, folic acid and Methylcobalamirt-the concentration of these compounds are Methylcobalamin is 1500 microgram per tablet, taurine is 500 mg and folic acid is 5 mg per tablet.<br>
This combination can relief in the infections on the feet and legs, in multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint, as well as Joss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, contractures of the toes, loss of the interosseous muscle function and leads to contraction of the digits, so called hammer toes , the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal and the logs of muscular function.<br>
Methylcobalamin<br>
Methylcobalamin is a cobalamin (MeCbl or MeB12) used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and as a preliminary treatment for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is a form of vitamin B12 and differs from cyanocobalamin in that the cyanide is replaced by a methyl group.<br>
The liver converts a small amount of cyanocobalamin into methylcobalamin within the body, but larger amounts of methylcobalamin are necessary to correct neurological defects and protect against aging.<br>
Role of SVIethvIcobalamin<br>
The most common forms of supplemental B12 are cyanocobalamin or hydroxycobaiamin. The natural form of B12 found in food is methylcobalamin (or a similar form, adenosylcobalamin). The structure of B12 is very complex, with numerous methyl groups attached. Methyl groups (CH3) are used in beneficial methylation reactions, such as those that reduce homocysteine. Methylcobalamin appears to be the most effective form of vitamin B12 to protect the nerves.<br>
Folic acid<br>
Folic acid (also known as vitamin B9 or folacin) and folate (the naturally occurring form), as well as pteroyl-L- glutamic acid and pteroyl-L-glutamate, are forms of the water-soluble vitamin B9. Folic acid is itself not biologically active, but its biological importance is due to tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives after its conversion to dihydrofolic acid in the liver.<br>
Type \ diabetes mellitus patients have lower plasma levels of folic acid and may benefit from folic acid supplements or folic acid fortified food products.<br>
Permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin B12 deficiency is not treated. Therefore, intake of supplemental folic acid should not exceed 1000 micrograms (1000 pg = 1 mg) per day to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.<br>
Role of folic acid<br>
In diabetic neuropathy, blood glucose control is essential because glucose causes high levels of oxidative stress throughout the body. In antioxidant therapy folic acid is very important antioxidant to help prevent neuropathy.<br>
Taurine<br>
Taurine, or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is an organic acid. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the lower intestine and, in small amounts, in the tissues of many animals, including humans. Taurine is a derivative of the sulfur-containing (sulfhydryl) amino acid cysteine. Taurine is one of the few known naturally occurring sulfonic acids.<br>
Role of taurine<br>
Taurine produces anxiolytic effect and may act as a modulator or anti-anxiety agent in the central nervous system. Taurine can influence (and possibly reverse) defects in nerve blood flow, motor nerve conduction velocity, and nerve sensory thresholds in experimental diabetic neuropathic rats. Taurine is regularly used as an ingredient in energy drinks. Taurine may exert a beneficial effect in preventing diabetes-associated microangiopathy and tubulointerstitial injury in diabetic nephropathy. Taurine acts as a glycation inhibitor.<br>
Treatment of diabetic neuropathy using combined administration of a formulation including as an active ingredient, antioxidant with an anti-diabetic agent in order to improve nerve conduction velocities. <br>
