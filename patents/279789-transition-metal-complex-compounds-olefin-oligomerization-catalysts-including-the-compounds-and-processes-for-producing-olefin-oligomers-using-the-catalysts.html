TRANSITION METAL COMPLEX COMPOUNDS, OLEFIN OLIGOMERIZATION<br>
CATALYSTS INCLUDING THE COMPOUNDS, AND PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING<br>
OLEFIN OLIGOMERS USING THE CATALYSTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to transition metal complex compounds, olefin oligomerization catalysts including the compounds, and processes of producing olefin oligomers with the catalysts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Industrial olefin oligomerization is most often catalyzed by organoaluminum compounds or transition metal compounds. The oligomerization of ethylene in particular gives a mixture of α-olefins. Of the α-olefins, 1-hexene has a high demand as a material for polyolefins, and high-selectivity processes for 1-hexene are desired. The only selective process that has been used in the industry is trimerization of ethylene using chromium compounds (Patent Document 1). This process affords approximately 8 kg of 1-hexene per 1 mmol chromium atom-hour under an ethylene pressure of 100 bar. However, it is preferred that a higher activity is achieved under a lower pressure so that the costs for pressure and catalyst in the production can<br>
be reduced.  Further, very few techniques have been reported for the production of 1-hexene by trimerizing ethylene with transition metal compounds other than chromium compounds (Patent Documents 2 and 3, Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2).<br>

The present inventors studied diligently to solve the problems in the art.  They have then found that olefin oligomerization catalysts containing a transition metal complex compound with a specific structure show excellent activity and<br>

The heteropoly compounds and isopoly compounds may be used singly, or two or more kinds may be used in combination.<br>
The ionizing ionic compounds (b-3) may be used singly, or two or more kinds may be used in combination.<br>
The olefin oligomerization catalyst according to the invention catalyzes the oligomerization of olefins with high activity.  In particular, ethylene may be oligomerized into 1-hexene with high selectivity.<br>
The olefin oligomerization catalyst containing the organoaluminum oxγ-compound (b-2) such as methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst shows very high trimerization activity with respect to ethylene. Consequently, 1-hexene is produced with high selectivity. The high activity and good selectivity in the oligomerization of ethylene into 1-hexene may be also achieved by the use of the ionizing ionic compound (b-3) such as triphenylcarbonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate as a cocatalyst.<br>
The olefin oligomerization catalyst contains the<br>
transition metal complex compound [A] and optionally contains at least one compound [B] selected from the organometallic compounds (b-1), the organoaluminum oxγ-compounds (b-2) and the ionizing ionic compounds (b-3).  Furthermore, the olefin oligomerization catalyst may contain a carrier [C] described below as required. [Carriers [C]]<br>
The carrier [C] optionally used in the invention is an inorganic or organic compound in the form of granular or fine particulate solid. In the invention, the carrier [C] supports the compound [A] and/or the compound [B]. Preferred inorganic compounds include porous oxides, inorganic halides, clays, clay minerals and ion-exchange layered compounds.<br>
Examples of the porous oxides include SiO2, A12O3, MgO, ZrO, Ti02, B203, CaO, ZnO, BaO, Th02, and complex compounds or mixtures containing these oxides, such as natural or synthetic zeolite, SiO2-MgO, SiO2-A12O3, SiO2-Ti02, SiO2-V205, SiO2-Cr2O3 and SiO2-Ti02-MgO. Of these, compounds containing SiO2 and/or A12O3 as a main component are preferable.<br>
The inorganic oxides may contain small amounts of carbonate, sulfate, nitrate and oxide components such as Na2CO3, K2CO3, CaCO3, MgCO3, Na2SO4, A12(SO4)3, BaSO4, KNO3, Mg(NO3)2, A1(NO3)3, Na20, K20 and Li20.<br>
The porous oxides have different properties depending on<br>
type and preparation process. The carrier used in the invention preferably has a particle diameter of 0.5 to 300 µm, preferably<br>
2<br>
20 to 200 µm, a specific surface area of 50 to 1,000 m /g,<br>
2	3<br>
preferably 100 to 700 m /g, and a pore volume of 0.3 to 3.0 cm /g. If necessary, the carrier may be calcined at 100 to 1,000°C, and preferably 150 to 700°C prior to use.<br>
Examples of the inorganic halides include MgCl2, MgBr2, MnCl2 and MnBr2. The inorganic halides may be used as they are, or may be used after pulverized with, for example, a ball mill or an oscillating mill. The inorganic halides may be dissolved in a solvent such as alcohol and precipitated as fine particles with a precipitating agent.<br>
The clays for use as the carriers in the invention are mainly composed of clay minerals.  The ion-exchange layered-compounds are compounds having a crystal structure wherein planes formed by ionic bonding or the like are piled on one another in parallel with a weak bond strength, and wherein the ions contained therein are exchangeable. Most clay minerals are ion-exchange layered compounds. The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds used in the invention are not limited to natural compounds but include synthetic products.<br>
Examples of such clays, clay minerals and ion-exchange layered compounds include clays, clay minerals and ion<br>
crystalline compounds having layered crystal structures such as hexagonal closest packing structure, antimony structure, CdCl2 structure and Cdl2 structure.<br>
Specific examples of the clays and the clay minerals include kaolin, bentonite, kibushi clay, gairome clay, allophane, hisingerite, pyrophyllite, mica, montmorillonite, vermiculite, chlorite, palygorskite, kaolinite, nacrite, dickite and halloysite. Specific examples of the ion-exchange layered compounds include salts of polyvalent metals and crystalline acids such as α-Zr (HAsOJ 2-H20, α-Zr (KP04) 2-3H20, α-Ti(HP04)2, α-Ti(HAsO4)2-H2O, α-Sn(HP04)2-H2O, γ-Zr(HP04)2, γ-Ti(HP04)2 and γ-Ti(NH4P04)2-H20.<br>
The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds preferably have a pore volume, as measured on pores having a radius of not less than 20 A by a mercury penetration method, of not less than 0.1 cc/g, and particularly preferably 0.3 to 5 cc/g. The pore volume is measured on pores having a<br>
radius of 20 to 3x104 A by a mercury penetration method using a mercury porosimeter. Achieving high oligomerization activity tends to be difficult if the carrier has a pore volume of less than 0.1 cc/g as measured on pores having a radius of not less than 20 A.<br>
It is also preferable that the clays and the clay minerals are subjected to chemical treatments. Any chemical treatments,<br>
for example, a surface treatment to remove impurities on the surface and a treatment to modify the crystal structure of clay, are employable. Examples of such chemical treatments include acid treatment, alkali treatment, salt treatment and organic substance treatment. The acid treatment removes impurities from the surface and also causes the elution of cations such as Al, Fe and Mg in the crystal structure to increase the surface area. The alkali treatment destroys the crystal structure of clay to bring about change in the structure of the clay. The salt treatment and the organic substance treatment produce, for example, ionic composites, molecular composites or organic derivatives to change the surface area or the interlayer distance.<br>
The ion-exchange layered compound may be a layered compound in which the exchangeable ions between layers have been exchanged with other large and bulky ions utilizing ion exchange properties to enlarge the distance between the layers.  The bulky ions play a pillar-like roll to support the layered structure and are generally called pillars. The introduction of other substances between layers of a layered compound is called intercalation.  Examples of the guest compounds to be intercalated include cationic inorganic compounds such as TiCl4 and ZrCl4; metal alkoxides such as Ti(OR)4, Zr(OR)4, PO(OR)3 and B (OR) 3 (R is a hydrocarbon group or the like) ; and metal hydroxide<br>
ions such as [Al1304 (OH) 24]7+, [Zr4 (OH) 14]2+ and [Fe30 (OCOCH3) J These compounds may be used singly, or two or more kinds may be used in combination.<br>
The intercalation of the above compounds may be carried out in the presence of dimers obtained by hydrolysis of metal alkoxides such as Si (OR) 4, Al (OR) 3 and Ge (OR) 4 (R is a hydrocarbon group or the like) or in the presence of colloidal inorganic compounds such as Si02. Examples of the pillars include oxides produced by intercalation of the above metal hydroxide ions between layers followed by thermal dehydration.<br>
The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds may be used as they are, or may be used after subjected to ball milling, sieving or the like. Moreover, they may be used after subjected to water adsorption or thermal dehydration. The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds may be used singly, or two or more kinds may be used in combination.<br>
Of the above-mentioned materials, the clays and the clay minerals are preferable, and montmorillonite, vermiculite, hectorite, tenorite and synthetic mica are particularly preferable.<br>
Examples of the organic compounds in the invention include granular or fine particulate solid compounds having a particle diameter of 10 to 300 \xm.     Such compounds include (co) dimers<br>
produced using C2-14 a-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene and 4-methyl-l-pentene as main components, (co)dimers produced using vinylcyclohexane or styrene as a main component, and modified products of these dimers.<br>
