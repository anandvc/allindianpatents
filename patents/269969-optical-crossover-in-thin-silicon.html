				<td>OPTICAL CROSSOVER IN THIN SILICON<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
The present application claims the benefit of US Provisional Application No.<br>
60/555,993, filed March 24,2004.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to optical crossovers and, more particularly, to the<br>
formation of optical crossovers in integrated photonic circuits utilizing a thin silicon<br>
waveguiding layer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the design and implementation of many integrated photonic circuits, waveguide<br>
intersections (hereinafter "crossovers") are unavoidable. This is particularly true of designs<br>
that involve switch interconnect patterns. However, the intersecting waveguides present an<br>
asymmetric index profile at the crossing. This profile disturbs the guided optical mode and<br>
excites higher-order optical modes. Since the intersection region is abrupt (i.e., nonadiabatic),<br>
it will excite non-guided modes, resulting in crosstalk and loss of optical power<br>
within the intersection. Moreover, the losses associated with intersecting planar optical<br>
waveguides are of special concern since the loss will be a function of the number of<br>
intersections encountered in a particular path, and will therefore vary with path layout.<br>
Many techniques have been proposed for reducing losses at the waveguide crossing.<br>
One approach is disclosed in US Patent 4,961,619, issued to Hernandez-Gil et al. on October<br>
9,1990. In this arrangement, the width of the waveguide is increased or decreased at the<br>
crossing junction to modify the optical mode characteristics in that region. This introduces<br>
an axial variation in the transverse index of refraction distribution, which allows for better<br>
alignment of the electrical fields at the crossing. The Hernandez-Gil et al. arrangement is<br>
not very suitable, however, for arrangements where there is a significant difference in<br>
refractive index between the guiding material and cladding material, since it requires large<br>
tapering regions to adiabatically expand/contract the guided optical mode.<br>
In another prior art reference, US Patent 5,157,756 issued to Nishimoto on October<br>
20,1972, a peripheral region of low index material is used to surround an island of<br>
waveguide material at the center of the crossing/intersecting region. This technique is also<br>
of limited use in situations where the refractive index difference is substantial. Thus, a need<br>
remains in the prior art for a configuration to provide for optical crossovers in a siliconbased<br>
material system where the difference in refractive index between the core and<br>
cladding areas may be significant.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to optical crossovers and, more particularly, to the<br>
formation of optical crossovers in integrated photonic circuits utilizing a thin silicon<br>
waveguiding layer. The implementation of the present invention is particularly well-suited<br>
for use in an SOI-based integrated photonic structure, where optical waveguiding areas are<br>
formed (at least in part) in a relatively thin (preferably, sub-micron) silicon surface layer<br>
(referred to as an "SOI layer") supported by an underlying insulating layer on a silicon<br>
substrate.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the waveguiding structure within the SOIbased<br>
device is particularly shaped in the crossover region to substantially reduce the<br>
possibility of crosstalk, while also coupling a significant portion of the propagating signal<br>
between an input waveguide portion and its associated output waveguide portion, thus<br>
improving the optical throughput along the separate waveguides.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, polysilicon regions of predetermined<br>
shapes are disposed over selected areas of the waveguides in the crossover region to further<br>
minimize signal loss due to crosstalk by reducing the overlap area of the intersecting signals.<br>
The crossover region may comprise a "pinwheel" geometry for reducing the area<br>
within which the overlapping signals will intersect The pinwheel itself may comprise<br>
various geometries to accommodate different signal conditions, such as transforming an<br>
expanding beam into a collimated beam, a collimated beam into a focused beam, etc.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that well-known CMOS processing<br>
techniques may be used to pattern and form the desired geometry of the crossover region,<br>
simplifying the manufacturing process. Similarly, the ability to deposit and pattern<br>
polysilicon in a desired manner is well-known from CMOS processing technology.<br>
Other and further embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
apparent during the course of the following discussion and by reference to the<br>

Detailed Description<br>
As briefly mentioned above, relatively thin silicon surface layers ("SOI layers") are<br>
used hi SOI-based opto-electronic arrangements to support the propagation of high speed<br>
optical signals. As is known in the art, it is possible to perform purely optical and optoelectronic<br>
functions within the same SOI structure, using the same CMOS fabrication<br>
techniques to form both types of devices. The use of CMOS techniques allows for the size<br>
of the optical functions to be greatly reduced (on the order of, for example, an area<br>
reduction on the order of 100X to 10.000X) as enabled by the use of high index contrast<br>
silicon waveguides. Additionally, when implemented properly, the manipulation of light<br>
using the free carrier effect requires no DC power. These advantages enable the optics to<br>
approach the same functional block sizes as traditional electronics. 'Thus, it is possible to<br>
have hundreds, if not thousands, of optical/opto-electronic functions on the same integrated<br>
circuit die, requiring a similar number of connections to be formed between associated<br>
devices. However, until the development of the present invention, as discussed hi detail<br>
hereinbelow, there has remained a need to form a "multi-level" optical interconnection for<br>
this type of optical arrangement, similar to the multi-level metal interconnect structures<br>
well-known in today's integrated electronic circuit design, that addresses the various issues<br>
associated with the cross over of intersecting optical signals.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a first embodiment of an SOI-based optical crossover structure<br>
formed in accordance with the present invention, where FIG. l(a) contains a top view and<br>
FIG. l(b) an isometric view of the same structure. As with all of the various embodiments<br>
that will be discussed hereinbelow, each SOI-based optical crossover structure of the present<br>
invention comprises a silicon substrate 10 and an insulating (dielectric) layer 12 disposed<br>
over silicon substrate 10. A relatively thin (preferably, sub-micron in thickness) single<br>
crystal silicon surface layer 14 is formed over insulating layer 12, where silicon surface<br>
layer 14 is nominally referred to as an "SOI layer". As shown in FIGs. l(a) and (b), SOI<br>
layer 14 has been processed (i.e., patterned and etched) to form a pair of optical waveguides<br>
16,18 that intersect each other within a crossover region 20 (the intersection indicated by<br>
the shaded area within region 20). In accordance with the present invention, crossover<br>
region 20 is particularly patterned and formed to allow for two propagating optical beams to<br>
cross through each other with relatively high efficiency and relatively low crosstalk. The<br>
patterned area where SOI layer 14 has been removed can be replaced (as shown by the<br>
dotted line in FIG. l(b)) with a CMOS-compatible material with a lower index of refraction,<br>
such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride to re-planarize the structure and simplify further<br>
processing.<br>
In order to minimize the effects of optical crossover, the light beams propagating<br>
through waveguides 16 and 18 should be substantially orthogonal to each other (if both of<br>
the same operating wavelength), or exhibit different operating wavelengths. For the<br>
purposes of the present discussion, the signal propagating along first waveguide 16 will be<br>
referred to as optical signal A and the signal propagating along second waveguide 18 will be<br>
referred to as optical signal B (where signals A and B will either be orthogonal or at<br>
different operating wavelengths).<br>
As shown in FIG. l(a), first waveguide 16 includes an input waveguiding section 22<br>
that terminates at crossover region 20, as defined by corners 24 and 26. The termination of<br>
input waveguiding section 22 allows for propagating optical signal A to expand as it<br>
traverses crossover region 20, as indicated by the dashed arrows in FIG. l(a). In particular,<br>
the shape of the termination of input waveguiding section 22 determines the beam<br>
characteristics as it enters crossover region 20. In accordance with the present invention,<br>
output waveguiding section 28 of first waveguide 16 includes inwardly tapering (hereinafter<br>
defined as "beam-capturing") sidewalls 30,32 that function to capture expanding,<br>
propagating optical signal A and re-focus the beam into exit port 34. Exit port 34 is<br>
preferably laterally confined to a dimension typically less than one micron, allowing for the<br>
arrangement of the present invention to be particularly well-suited for use in single mode<br>
applications.<br>
In a similar manner, second optical waveguide 18 is formed to include an input<br>
I<br>
waveguiding section 36 that terminates at corners 38,40 to allow propagating optical signal<br>
B to expand as it traverses crossover region 20 (as shown by the dotted arrows in FIG. l(a)).<br>
Output waveguide section 42 of second optical waveguide 18 includes beam-capturing<br>
sidewalls 44,46 to re-focus the expanding optical signal B into an exit port 48 (exit port 48<br>
being preferably of sub-micron lateral dimension to support only single mode propagation).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, proper patterning of crossover region 20 to<br>
include corners at the ends of the input waveguiding sections and the beam-capturing<br>
sidewalls along the output waveguiding sections allows for optical signals A and B to<br>
intersect within region 20 without experiencing significant crosstalk and signal loss by<br>
confining the intersecting area to a relatively ;small shaded region, as shown. As<br>
importantly, it is to be understood that signals A and B are preferably orthogonal or<br>
operating at different wavelengths to provide additional isolation between the propagating<br>
signals.<br>
' FIG. 2 contains an isometric view of an alternative embodiment of the arrangement<br>
of FIG. 1, where instead of forming the intersecting waveguides within SOI layer 14, the<br>
intersecting waveguides are formed within a layer of polysilicon 17 that has been disposed<br>
over SOI layer 14 and subsequently patterned to form the desired waveguiding structure.<br>
The addition of the polysilicon layer 17 serves to modify the optical mode field, as shown.<br>
As in the case in the formation of such SOI-based devices, a relatively thin oxide layer 15 is<br>
disposed between SOI layer 14 and polysilicon layer 17, where oxide layer 15 is etched in<br>
the same manner as polysilicon layer 17 to form the crossover structure. In this particular<br>
embodiment, an essentially identical arrangement as discussed above is formed, including a<br>
first waveguide 19 to support the propagation of optical signal A and a second waveguide 21<br>
to support the propagation of optical signal B, with a crossover region 20 as discussed<br>
hereinabove.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates another variation of the embodiment of FIG. 1, where strategicallylocated<br>
polysilicon segments have been added to further shape and control the paths of the<br>
propagating optical signals, where as in FIG. 1 the waveguides are formed within SOI layer<br>
14. In particular, FIG. 3(a) contains a top view of this exemplary "poly-loaded" variation<br>
and FIG. 3(b) contains an isometric view of the same arrangement. During the fabrication<br>
process for this variation, a relatively thin oxide layer 50 is first formed over SOI layer 14,<br>
and a polysilicon layer 52 is formed over oxide layer 50. The combination of layers 50,52<br>
is then patterned and etched to form the discrete shaping areas as shown hi FIG. 3. In<br>
particular, polysilicon layer 52 is patterned to form a pair of input launching segments 54,<br>
56, where these segments include terminating end portions 58 and 60, respectively. To<br>
further reduce the optical loss, polysilicon layer 52 can be further processed to enhance the<br>
crystallinity of its structure, so that it becomes similar in morphology to SOI layer 14. The<br>
particular geometry of input segments 54,56 assists in confining the propagating optical<br>
signals A and B to the interior portions of waveguides 16 and 18, thus reducing scattering<br>
losses and minimizing the area of signal overlap within crossover region 20 (compare, for<br>
example, the shaded area in crossover region 20 of FIG. l(a) to the shaded area in FIG.<br>
3(a)). Referring to FIGs. 3(a) ,and (b), a pan: of output tapered segments 62 and 64 are<br>
shown as formed in polysilicon layer 52 so as to overly output waveguiding sections 28 and<br>
42, respectively. The tapered geometry of polysilicon segments 62 and 64 is used to reduce<br>
reflections and improve the coupling efficiency of the propagating signals into exit ports 34<br>
and 48, respectively. It is to be noted that the terminations 58, 60 of input launching<br>
segments 54, 56 may also be tapered to reduce reflections.<br>
As an alternative to the strip waveguide structures discussed above, a "rib"<br>
waveguiding structure may be formed in SOI layer 14 to include a pair of intersecting<br>
waveguides with a crossover area in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 4 contains<br>
an isometric view of this exemplary embodiment, where SOI layer 14 has been partially<br>
etched to remove a portion of layer 14 outside of the waveguiding region, the remainder of<br>
SOI layer 14 being intact so that underlying dielectric layer 12 remains completely covered.<br>
As shown, a patterning and controlled etching of SOI layer 14 allows the formation of a first<br>
waveguide 41 and a second waveguide 43 intersecting as before in crossover region 20.<br>
FIGs. 5(a) and (b) illustrate another embodiment of the present invention, in atop<br>
view and cut-a\vay side view, respectively. In this embodiment, a pair of waveguides 70<br>
and 72 is used to support the propagation of optical signals A and B within the SOI-based<br>
structure of silicon substrate 10, insulating layer 12 and SOI layer 14. In this particular<br>
embodiment, a crossover region 74 is defined by forming a first inward tapered region 76<br>
along a first waveguiding section 78 of first optical waveguide 70 and a second outward<br>
tapered region 80 along a second waveguiding section 82 of first optical waveguide 70.<br>
Crossover region 74 is further defined by the use of a polysilicon bridging portion 84 that is<br>
appropriately configured, as shown specifically in FIG. 5(a), to facilitate the physical<br>
separation of optical signals A and B to minimize crosstalk in accordance with the present<br>
invention. As best shown in FIG. 5(b), the inclusion of polysilicon bridging portion 84<br>
functions to migrate propagating optical signal B out of inward tapered region of 76, through<br>
bridging portion 84, and then into outward tapered region 80. Advantageously, in crossover<br>
region 74 propagating optical signal B is moved out of the signal path of propagating optical<br>
signal A, as clearly shown in FIG. 5(b). Thus, the potential for optical crosstalk and signal<br>
loss between optical signals A and B is significantly reduced.<br>
As mentioned above, polysilicon bridging portion 84 is formed to include tapering<br>
terminations along first waveguide 70 and second waveguide 72 hi order to reduce<br>
reflections and more efficiently couple the propagating optical signals into their respective<br>
output waveguiding sections 72 and 82.<br>
An efficient crossover region structure has been developed and is illustrated in the<br>
various embodiments shown in FIGs. 6-11. In general, this crossover region is defined as a<br>
"pinwheel" geometry, including sidewalls providing total internal reflection (TIR) to direct<br>
propagating optical signals A and B between their input and output waveguiding sections.<br>
I<br>
In a first embodiment as shown in a top view of FIG. 6, a crossover pinwheel region 90 is<br>
used to couple optical signal A between an input waveguiding region 92 and an output<br>
waveguiding region 94. In similar fashion, crossover pinwheel region 90 is used to couple<br>
optical signal B between an input waveguiding region 96 and an output waveguiding region<br>
98.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, crossover pinwheel region 90 is formed by<br>
appropriately patterning and etching SOI layer 14 so as to form a set of reflecting sidewall<br>
surfaces to redirect the propagating signals and reduce the area within crossover pinwheel<br>
region 90 where the propagating signals will overlap (indicated by the shaded area within<br>
region 90). By etching SOI layer 14 to form such surfaces, the difference hi refractive index<br>
between SOI layer 14 and the adjacent material (for example, "air", or an insulating<br>
material, such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride), the propagating signal will experience<br>
TIR and be re-directed to remain within crossover pinwheel region 90. Referring to FIG. 6,<br>
incoming optical A is first coupled into input waveguiding region 92. As with the<br>
embodiment discussed above in association with FIG. 1, optical signal A will begin to<br>
expand upon encountering a pair of corners 100 and 102 at the termination of input<br>
waveguiding region 92. The expanding signal then impinges a first curved sidewall surface<br>
104 formed by patterning and etching SOI layer 14, ets discussed above. Expanding optical<br>
signal A will then reflect off of first curved surface 104 and propagate in a collimated<br>
fashion, as shown, within crossover pinwheel region 90 until encountering a second curved<br>
sidewall surface 106 also formed within SOI layer 14. As shown by the dashed arrows in<br>
FIG. 6, second curved sidewall surface 106 will function to focus propagating signal A into<br>
output waveguiding region 94.<br>
Similarly, incoming optical signal B is shown as coupled into input waveguiding<br>
section 96 and thereafter expanding as it encounters corners 108 and 110 at the termination<br>
of input waveguiding section 96. Expanding optical signal B will then impinge a third<br>
curved sidewall surface 112, which will collimate and re-direct signal B (as shown by the<br>
dotted lines) through crossover pinwheel region 90. Collimated propagating signal B then<br>
impinges a fourth curved sidewall surface 114, which functions to focus propagating optical<br>
signal B into output waveguiding section 98, as shown in FIG. 6. A significant aspect of the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 6 is that it can be used as a bi-directional device (i.e., using the<br>
"outputs" as "inputs" and vice versa).<br>
However, coupling into output waveguiding sections 94 and 98 may encounter<br>
reflection and backscattering problems associated with the presence of "corners" at the input<br>
to these sections. That is, corners 116,118 of first output waveguiding section 94 and<br>
corners 120,122 of second output waveguiding section 98 may affect the coupling<br>
efficiency between crossover pinwheel region 90 and output waveguiding sections 94,98.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a variation of the embodiment of FIG. 6 that addresses this concern<br>
regarding coupling into the output waveguiding sections. Here, each output waveguiding<br>
region is formed to include a beam-capturing tapered portion to improve its coupling<br>
efficiency. As shown, first output waveguiding section 94 is formed to include a beamcapturing<br>
portion 124 and second output waveguiding section 98 is formed to include a<br>
beam-capturing portion 126. The use of the tapered, beam-capturing portions allows for a<br>
greater amount of the propagating signal to be collected and directed into its associated<br>
output waveguiding section. The use of conventional CMOS processing to form the various<br>
waveguiding features of the present invention allows for beam-capturing portions 124,126<br>
to easily be included by adjusting the patterning of crossover pinwheel region 90. While<br>
improving the coupling efficiency into the output waveguiding sections, it is to be<br>
understood that the inclusion of the tapered geometry results hi eliminating the possibility of<br>
using the structure as a bi-directional device. Therefore, if the need exists to employ bidirectional<br>
devices, the structure of FIG. 6 remains preferred over the structure of FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 8 is yet another variation of the pinwheel geometry as discussed above in<br>
association with FIGs. 6 and 7. hi this variation, polysilicon segments have been included<br>
over selected portions of the input and output waveguiding regions of the FIG. 7 structure to<br>
further improve the coupling efficiency into and out of crossover pinwheel region 90. In<br>
particular, first and second polysilicon segments 128 and 130 have been disposed over input<br>
waveguiding sections 92 and 96 to improve the lateral confinement of the propagating input<br>
signal and shape the properties of the optical beam entering crossover region 90. As shown,<br>
the terminations of both polysilicon segments 128 and 130 are tapered to better control the<br>
coupling of the signal from the combination polysilicon/silicon waveguiding structure into<br>
SOI layer 14 only. An additional pair of polysilicon segments 132 and 134 are shown in<br>
FIG. 8 as disposed over output waveguiding sections 94 and 98, respectively, where<br>
polysilicon segments 132 and 134 are used to improve the coupling efficiency into (as well<br>
as along) each of the output waveguiding sections. It is to be understood that instead of<br>
utilizing polysilicon segments, various other rib-type structures (see FIG. 4, for example)<br>
may be used.<br>
A top view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in<br>
FIG. 9, where in this case the input signals are collimated prior to entering the crossover<br>
structure, hi particular, propagating optical signals A and B are shown as being coupled into<br>
relatively wide input waveguiding sections 140 and 142, respectively ("relatively wide" as<br>
compared to input vsjaveguiding sections 92 and 96 of FIGs. 6 - 8). As with the embodiment<br>
discussed above in association with FIG. 6, the structure as illustrated in FIG. 9 is<br>
considered to be a bi-directional device. In this embodiment, an expanded pinwheel<br>
crossover region 144 is formed to accommodate the propagating collimated signals and<br>
perform a focusing operation on the signals so as to limit the physical extent of the<br>
waveguides where the signals will overlap (shaded region 146 illustrating the overlap area).<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, collimated optical signal A impinges a first curved sidewall surface<br>
148, where the curve of surface 148 is controlled to transform collimated propagating signal<br>
A into a focused beam, as shown. After passing through overlap area 146, propagating<br>
optical signal A will begin to expand and propagate through expanded pinwheel crossover<br>
region 144 until impinging a second curved sidewall surface 150. The curve of surface 150<br>
is controlled so that the signal is re-converted into a collimated wave as it enters a first<br>
output waveguiding region 152.<br>
In a similar fashion, an input collimated optical signal B propagating along input<br>
waveguiding section 142 will encounter a third curved sidewall surface 154, which functions<br>
to redirect optical signal B and focus the signal toward overlap region 146. As with optical<br>
signal A, propagating optical signal B will thereafter expand and then impinge a fourth<br>
curved sidewall surface 156, transforming optical signal B into a collimated signal that is<br>
directed into a second output waveguiding section 158. As with the embodiments described<br>
above, conventional CMOS fabrication techniques may be used process SOI layer 14 to<br>
form the desired "expanded pinwheel" geometry for crossover region 144.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an alternative "pinwheel" geometry crossover region that has been<br>
formed to focus an incoming collimated beam into a sub-micron dimensioned waveguide; a<br>
desirable arrangement for systems utilizing single mode optical signals. In this arrangement,<br>
a collimated optical signal A propagates along input waveguiding segment 248 and<br>
encounters a first curved sidewall surface 250, where the curvature of first sidewall 250 has<br>
been calculated to provide the desired focusing within the prescribed optical path length. As<br>
with the arrangements described above, first curved sidewall surface 250 is formed by<br>
patterning and etching SOI layer 14 to exhibit the shape as shown. The portions of SOI<br>
layer 14 removed by etching is then subsequently re-planarized using a relatively low index<br>
material (such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride) to maintain the necessary TIR condition.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 10, optical signal A is converted into a focused beam which is<br>
thereafter directed into a sub-micron dimensioned waveguide 252, where waveguide 252 is<br>
formed to provide sufficient lateral confinement of the optical beam such that only a single<br>
mode (fundamental mode) of the propagating optical signal will be supported. As with a<br>
number of the embodiments discussed above, beam-capturing sidewalls 254,256 may be<br>
formed at the entrance of waveguide 252 to assist in directing optical signal A into the single<br>
mode waveguide. As with various other arrangements described above, polysilicon<br>
segments may be disposed over the output waveguiding sections to improve coupling<br>
efficiency.<br>
In a similar fashion, incoming optical signal B is illustrated as encountering a second<br>
curved sidewall surface 258, where the curvature of surface 258 is calculated to accept an<br>
incoming collimated signal and convert the collimated wave into a focused beam. In this<br>
case, focused optical signal B is thereafter directed into a single mode waveguide 260,<br>
waveguide 260 including beam-capturing sidewalls 262 and 264 to improve its coupling<br>
efficiency.<br>
A specific embodiment suitable for providing crossover of collimated signals is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 11. In this case, a set of 45° mirror structures may be etched into the<br>
surface of SOI layer 14 to provide the desired 90° signal re-direction between the input and<br>
the output. As with a number of the arrangements described above, the arrangement of FIG.<br>
11 is a bi-directional optical crossover device, allowing for the "inputs" and "outputs" to be<br>
reversed. Referring to FIG. 11, collimated optical signal A will propagate along an input<br>
waveguiding area 270 until it impinges a first mirror 272, which is positioned to re-direct '<br>
optical signal A through a 90° rotation so as to now propagate along a substantially<br>
orthogonal signal path until encountering a second mirror 274. Second mirror 274 then again<br>
re-directs optical signal A through a 90° rotation, into an output waveguiding area 276.<br>
Similarly, third and fourth mirrors 278,280 are formed at predetermined locations within<br>
SOI layer 14 to provide re-direction of collimated optical signal B between an input<br>
waveguiding section 282 and output waveguiding section 284 (where as stated above, the<br>
"input" and "output" waveguides may be reversed to provide bi-directional transmission).<br>
In contrast to the various embodiments described above, crossover of optical signals<br>
may also occur through evanescently coupling a signal from one waveguide to an adjacent<br>
waveguide. Evanescent coupling is well-known in the art. FIG. 12 illustrates a first<br>
embodiment utilizing evanescent coupling where a pair of ring resonators 160 and 162 is<br>
formed by patterning and etching SOI layer 14 of an SOI-based opto-electronic structure.<br>
As shown, the etched structures are used to couple propagating optical signal A between an<br>
input waveguiding section 164 and output waveguiding section 166. A transverse optical<br>
waveguide 168 is used to support the propagation of optical signal B along the signal path as<br>
shown in FIG. 12. As with the embodiments discussed above, A and B are preferably<br>
orthogonal signals (or signals propagating at substantially different wavelengths). The<br>
combination of ring resonators 160,162 with the central area of transverse optical<br>
waveguide 168 is thus defined as a crossover region 170. In operation, optical signal A is<br>
coupled into input waveguiding section 164. The presence of first ring resonator 160 will<br>
function to evanescently couple at least a portion of the energy in optical signal A into its<br>
ring structure. An absorption element 172 is shown as positioned at the termination of input<br>
waveguiding section 164. Absorption element 172 may be merely a passive device used to<br>
provide containment for any remaining signal not coupled into ring resonator 160.<br>
Alternatively, absorption element 172 may comprise an active optical device, used to<br>
monitor the functioning of ring resonator by determining the amount of optical energy<br>
remaining in waveguide 164, using this information to perhaps "tune" the wavelength<br>
sensitivity of ring resonator 160.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, transverse waveguide 168 is disposed in relation to first ring<br>
resonator 160 so as to couple substantially all of the optical energy from first ring resonator<br>
160 into transverse waveguide 168. In this case, second ring resonator 162 is positioned<br>
"downstream" of first ring resonator along transverse waveguide 168 so that propagating<br>
optical signal A will then couple into second ring resonator 162. By properly positioning<br>
output waveguiding section 166 with respect to second ring resonator 162, optical signal A<br>
will evanescentiy couple from second ring resonator 162 into output waveguiding section<br>
166. A second absorption element 174 is included at the termination of output waveguiding<br>
section 166, since this particular structure may be used as a bi-directional device (with the<br>
inputs and outputs being reversed).<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an alternative evanescent coupling arrangement of the present<br>
invention, again forming the waveguiding sections and crossover region by patterning and<br>
etching SOI layer 14 of an SOI-based structure. In the embodiment of FIG. 13, a pair of<br>
waveguides 180 and 182 is formed as shown within SOI layer 14. Waveguide 182 is<br>
illustrated as a transverse waveguide structure and waveguide 180 is illustrated as a "U"-<br>
shaped waveguide, with the base of the "U" formed to be essentially parallel with a portion<br>
of waveguide 182 and form an evanescent coupling ("crossover") region 184. The length L<br>
of crossover region 184 is determined as a function of the wavelength of the propagating<br>
(orthogonal) signals so that input propagating optical signal A will be coupled from an input<br>
waveguiding section 186 of U-shaped waveguide 180 into an output waveguiding section<br>
188 of transverse waveguide 182, with optical signal B thus be coupled from an input<br>
waveguiding section 190 of transverse waveguide 182 into an output waveguiding section<br>
192 of U-shaped waveguide 180.<br>
An optical tap type of crossover formed hi accordance with the present invention is<br>
shown in FIG. 14, which includes a transverse waveguide 200 and a pair of optical tap<br>
waveguides 202,204 formed by patterning and etching SOI layer 14 of an SOI-based<br>
structure. As shown, propagating optical signal A is applied as an input along first optical<br>
tap waveguide 202, and is then evanescently coupled into transverse waveguide 200.<br>
Optical signal B is shown as propagating in the transverse direction along the full extent of<br>
waveguide 200,'where relatively little (if any) of the energy from optical signal B is coupled<br>
into either one of optical taps 202 and 204. A crossover region 206 is defined in this<br>
embodiment as comprising the central portion 208 of transverse waveguide 200 where both<br>
optical signals A and B are supported, as well as the end portions 210 and 212 of optical taps<br>
202 and 204, respectively. As with the embodiment of FIG. 12, a pair of absorption<br>
elements 214 and 216 may be disposed at the terminations of end portions 210 and 212,<br>
respectively, to absorb any remaining signal and, possibly, function as a detecting element.<br>
Indeed, the arrangement of FIG. 14 is also bi-directional, where the input and output<br>
waveguides may be reversed so as to support the propagation of optical signals in the<br>
opposite direction.<br>
