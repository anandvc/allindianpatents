				<td>METHOD  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATION  OF  ORNAMENTAL  STONES,  DEVICE  AND RELEVANT PLANT<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the consolidation of ornamental stones, mainly but not exclusively, used in buildings for both floors and coatings, performed by using soluble silicate aqueous solutions. The method is applied while working ornamental stones on both semifinished products and end-items. The invention also relates to the means allowing the consolidation method to be implemented.<br>
The consolidation treatment is required in the plates-like rocky material since its first aim is to seal the rock porosities and fractures and to improve then the semi finished product mechanical properties, particularly the flexural strength and the modulus of elasticity. Moreover, the consolidation allows for example stronger semifinished products to be obtained, suitable to stand all the following working steps exposing the rock at high mechanical stresses to obtain end-items with higher mechanical properties than similar untreated products. Moreover, the treatment aims at improving the ornamental stone appearance by performing an improved polishing, accentuating the rock natural colours.<br>
The prior art comprise several methods for consolidating stones or rocky materials in plates by impregnating them with fluid products or the like; they can be split in two families of methods; the resin impregnation and the silicate aqueous solution impregnation.<br>
The rocky material treatment by means of resins is well known and commonly used. The material to be impregnated can be inserted in a chamber, plunged into the resin and afterwards the chamber is put under pressure to help the resin, usually very viscous, penetrate the material.<br>
The patent DE  3930281  describes  a method wherein  the  resin' penetration is obtained by heating the plate material for the full dehydration thereof and afterwards by exhausting the chamber before plunging the plate into the impregnating fluid,  the method being<br>
 <br>
completed by the resin catalysis in a furnace.<br>
Other patents, one of the most recent thereof being the US patent application 2004/0076771, describe the plate impregnation method for a repair or aestetical purpose wherein plates are vertically approached with interposed sheets of material absorbing the resin and at least one sheet of plastic material being not concerned by the resin action, all this for the following breakdown of the so-formed block after the impregnation. This impregnation occurs after heating the plates being worked, composing the block in modular equipment which can be made tight, ispregnating with the resin at the atmospheric pressure and at a higher pressure, sealing said equipment and controlling the resin absorption during the process by said block of plates.<br>
The use of resins has however a series of disadvantages mainly because they are toxic, polluting, expensive; after being used in a single process they cannot be recycled and they require different devices and subsequent process steps mainly because of the machine and plant staining, of the need to reduce to a minimum the area around the material being treated in order to reduce the resin being used and the cost as well as of the need for very trick steps for approaching and separating the plates from the block of plates being treated.<br>
To remedy these problems water glass solutions are used as a consolidant in the art. The water glass properties of consolidating, proofing and improving the mechanical features of grounds, composed of inorganic powders and rocky materials are well known. Different water glass solution compositions are described in the art according to the material function and kind as well as to the rock configuration. In many cases other substances and compounds are added to the water glass solution, based on the need to control different consolidator parameters such as the solution viscosity, the hardening time, the impermeableness features. The solution impregna*tion into the material occurs for a higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure.<br>
In fact a method is known in the art by the patent EP 651842 that describes a silicate impregnation for consolidating plates or sheets<br>
 <br>
of rocky material by means of water glass solutions. The impregnation is performed by applying a pressure to the solution, with minimum values from 0.8 mpa (8 bars) up to, and preferably of, 15 mpa (150 bars).<br>
However, the use of said method with silicates requires the use of convenient quantities of additives in order not to obtain very long hardening times. Therefore, water glass solutions being used for the impregnation can be used only for limited times, i.e. at the longest one or two days. Moreover, the pressure action, contrary to what has been emphasised in the patent description, does not allow a silicate solidification to be obtained without defects since the gas and steam in the fissures and micro-porosities of the plate being worked, with the high pressure is reduced to micro-cavities in the solidified silicate making the mechanical resistance thereof and s\ibsequently of the impregnated plate lower.<br>
This prior art is subject to many inprovements as to the possibi1ity to perform a treatment allowing the rock porosities and fractures to be sealed and thus the semifinished product mechanical properties to be improved, in particular the flexural strength and the modulus of elasticity in order to stand all the working steps exposing the plates at high mechanical stresses.<br>
A further improvement concerns the achievement of end-items with higher mechanical properties than similar untreated products and with such a level that can be hardly found in nature. And not least the treatment improvement allows the ornamental stone aesthetical properties to be improved ensuring a better result of the polishing operation, as well as accentuating the rock natural colours.<br>
From the above it results the need to solve the technical problem<br>
of realising a treatment method by inrpregnation of the natural stone<br>
or rocky material plates or slices, allowing the consolidation<br>
thereof to be obtained so to overcome the drawbacks of known<br>
methods.     	<br>
Moreover, a main aim of the present treatment is to seal the rock porosities and fractures and thus to improve the semi finished product mechanical properties so as to stand all  the following<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
working steps exposing the rock at high mechanical stresses.<br>
Moreover, a further aim is to realise end-items with higher mechanical properties than similar untreated products, as well as to obtain an improved ornamental stone appearance.<br>
Furthermore, a second but not less import-ant aim is to realise water glass solutions to impregnate rocky materials in plates or slices having a higher stability and average life than known solutions.<br>
Finally, last but not least an aim is to realise a plant and specific  equipment  to  inclement  the  consolidation  treatment, allowing the treatment to be performed with a sufficient industrial production  capacity:  i.e.  making  the  treatment  steps  not only possible but also cheap to perform.<br>
The invention solves said technical problem, by adopting: a consolidation method of plate-like, slice-like or modular-element-1ike ornamental stones, comprising; the impregnation through the pressure created in the treatment environment by means of a water glass solution wherein the material being treated is plunged for enough time for the full penetration in fissures and micro-porosities of the surface thereof; characterised in that it comprises the following steps: ~ A pre-treatment of the material by exhausting;<br>
-	A permanence of the pre-treatment step for enough time, after<br>
reaching the desired vacuxim value, to extract gases, steams and<br>
powders existing in said fissures and micro-porosities;<br>
-	An injection of the impregnating solution in the same vacuum pre-treatment chamber, with a water glass solution suitable for the lithotype of the rock being treated and for the mechanical-aesthetical object aimed by the impregnation;<br>
-	Keeping the treatment chamber under vacuum during the injection;<br>
-	An impregnation step being kept for enough time for the solution to penetrate said fissures and micro-porosities always,. under vacuiim.<br>
Moreover, by adopting, in a preferred enibodiment: after the impregnation, to a seasoning step of the treated material at a temperature slightly exceeding the room temperature for a length, of at least one day.<br>
 <br>
Further features of the adopted method will be more apparent from the following description and claims.<br>

Moreover, by adopting, in a preferred embodiment: to at least a seasoning station equipped with one or more con trolled-temperature chambers for the full impregnant curing and drying.<br>
Further features of the adopted plant will be more apparent in the following description and claims.<br>
An implementation of the invention is shown, by single way of example, in the attached seven drawings wherein: Figure 1 is the perspective schematic view of the plant for the consolidation treatment of rocky material plates according to the invention, in this case sized for slices cut from granite blocks; Figure 2 is the perspective schematic view of the composition station of the slice handling frame in the open state for the loading; Figure 3 is the perspective schematic view of the loading station of Figure 2 with slices being already positioned on the still open frame; Figure 4 is the schematic view of a kind of empty frame with the "L"-shaped closing arms; Figure 5 is the schematic view of the closed frame with the slices ready for the handling; Figure 6 is the perspective enlarged view of the loading/unloading station of the slices of the plant of Figure 1; Figure 7 is the side view of the handling of a frame complete of slices; Figure 8 is the perspective enlarged view of the vacuum treatment chamber of figure 1; Figure 9 is the cross section of a vacuum treatment and impregnation chamber during the impregnation step; Figure 10 is the perspective enlarged view of the impregnated slice seasoning chamber, each one with different stowage planes, for the final consolidation of the water glass solution.<br>
Figure 1 shows the different stations of the treatment plant according to the invention wherein the slices 1 comes from the roller table 2 in the plant loading/unloading station 3. Upstream a slice washing and drying chamber 4 is on said roller table before .. the loading/unloading station. A known suction-cup aerial handler-5 attends to moving the slices 1 from the roller table 2 onto the frame 50 equipped with mobile combs 51 for separating the sides of the slices 1 during the loading. The handler 5 during its motion positions one slice 1 between pairs of comb dents 52 so that they<br>
 <br>
are also separated by pairs of fingers 53 equipping the frame on the supporting beam 54 of the slice edges 55; the combs are operated by actuating cylinders 56 in rising and descending. A truck 6 carries the cluster 7 of slices 1 in the vacuum chamber 8 of the impregnation station 9; a door 10 closes for exhausting each chamber. The following seasoning station 11 has the seasoning chambers 12 wherein the truck. 6 handles the slice clusters 7 on the different shelves.<br>
Figure 4 also shows the upper closing "L"-shaped arms 57 of the frame 50 after loading the slices 1. These arms are equipped with fingers 58 stretching out downwards i.e. towards the slice upper edge 55 after closing the frame, as it can be seen in figure 5.<br>
In Figure 7 the truck 6 is equipped with forks 61 extending over the sooiddle of the length of the slices 1 for the lower picking up of the frame 50 with the slice cluster 7.<br>
Vacuum chambers 8, as it can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, of the impregnation area 9 are adjacent and they have an upper duct 20 housing an sectioning solenoid valve 21 for controlling the exhaustion from the main vacuum pipe 22; the frames 50 loaded with the cluster 7 of slices 1 are supported by guides 23 longitudinally to the vacuum chamber 8. The chamber bottom 24 has a "V" shape collecting the water glass solution during the emptying, by means of the duct 25 equipped with a filter for impurities 26 and with an sectioning solenoid valve 27 towards an impregnating solution backflow pipe 28; the solution is stowed in a tank 29. During the treatment the water glass solution is kept at level S, just lower the upper edge 55 of the slices 1. A screen 31 with side openings to avoid the suction of fluid drops or particles protects the vacuum suction mouth 30. The vacuum chamber 8 is equipped with pipes 31 for distributing and spraying the washing water.<br>
The seasoning station 11 of impregnated slices 1 comprises the chamber 12 where warm air is blown in at the reopaired temperature even different between the two shown chambers, the air being produced by the thermal station 13; chambers are split into housings<br>
 <br>
14 on different shelves wherein the frames 50 with the slice clusters 7 are supported on longitudinal guides 15. The seasoning chambers are closed by a single lid 16 for each housing in order to handle from the single housings the respective clusters of slices 7 individually.<br>
The treatment method according to the invention con^rises a product vacuum pre-treatment step in order to obtain dry and clean materials, clearing the porosities and fractures from dusts and residual gases, in order to ensuire the following pervasive penetration of the consolidant and the direct interaction between the consolidant and the minerals composing the rock.<br>
The pre-treatment step consists in a vacuum treatment of the slices 1 positioned in the vacutim chamber 8 which can be used in the following step as an impregnation chamber. The vacuum chamber has a tank, with a side opening with a door 10, being both tight. The chamber 8 is connected through the pipe 20 and 22 to one or more pumps, not shown, capable to create in the chamber the desired vacuum level. Advantageously the products are semifinished productis, i.e. plates, sheets and unfinished slices and they are positioned on one side in the structure supporting them, the frame 50 and the arms 57, in order to keep them apart at a relative minimum distance helping the impregnating solution to flow between them. The distance is predetermined with respect to the semi finished product surface width. The plates, slices or modular elements are positioned in the frame structure with the greater surfaces so oriented to favour the fluid downflow once the impregnation treatment is finished, preferably vertically or even siib-vertically oriented with an edge or side almost aligned with the bottom 24 of said tank.<br>
The method of the present invention provides in the pre-treatment step to reach a vacuum being lower than 2 mbar, preferably of 0.2-0.3 mbar. The time needed to reach the required vacuum (the envisaged-'vacuum) varies according to the volume and the typology of -  • - -the rock, to be treated, the rock moisture degree, the cleanliness of the semifinished product surfaces and obviously the features of the pump system being used; the material being treated must be previously cleaned, and eventually washed and dried by means of<br>
 <br>
compressed air jets in chamber 4, in order to remove the residual cutting powders and to be also, as much as possible, dry. The time needed to reach the above-mentioned vacuum degree varies according to the type of rock, being comprised between 2 and 12 hours.<br>
Once the vacuum required in the pre-treatment step is obtained, the inqpregnation step occiirs, controlling the suction of the pumps extracting the air from the vacuum chamber 8; in the plant of figure 1 this operation is performed by the solenoid valve 21 which intercepts and stops the connection of the chamber to the main vacuiim pipe 22, being operated by a logic control equipment to keep the required vacuum degree.<br>
The water glass solution is then injected, keeping the absolute pressure in the vacuum chamber 8 low. The solution inlet is favoured by the inner vacuum; the injection control is performed by operating the sectioning solenoid valve 27 of the solution positioned in the feeding pipe 25; in a preferred embodiment of the invention this solenoid valve is operated fay a logic control equipment. The fluid is injected from the chamber bottom 24, during the impregnating glass water solution inlet step; the vacuum degree in the chamber, in a preferred embodiment of the method, is such as to favour the boiling and the subsequent water loss from the water glass solution. The steam being released in the vacuum chamber 8 and the pressure exerted by the inlet fluid from the pipe 25 determine the increase in the inner absolute pressure. This pressure in the vacuum chamber is kept in this step at the predetermined value and not exceeding 300 mbar.<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention the materials being<br>
treated are vacuum-impregnated, in order to accelerate and help the<br>
impregnant to enter the rock porosities, to ensure a pervasive<br>
impregnation in the thickness of the plates, slices or modular<br>
elements of the cavities and micro-porosities on the surface<br>
thereof.	<br>
Carrying on the application of the method the inner pressure is kept at a lower value than the atmospheric value,  therefore the solution injection is actually vacuum-performed.  Prefersibly this fluid inlet operation is directly controlled according to the vacutun<br>
 <br>
degree in the chamber operating for example at a constant absolute pressure value comprised between 10 and 100 mbar.<br>
The level S of the impregnating solution in the vacuum chamber 8 must be such as not to exceed the upper edge 55 of the slices being treated, i.e. to reach then a level just below said upper edge. The tests being performed confirmed that this is a trick enormously helping the impregnant to enter the rock contributing to a reduction of the overall treatment times.<br>
The vacuum chamber 8 must be left closed for enough time so that the process continues by capillarity and the i mpregnation occurs homogeneously. Preferably the vacuum level is kept constant close to the steam pressure level of the solution being used, however within the range of 10 and 50 mbar in order to optimise the treatment times. A time interval considerably varying between 4 and 24 hours has been detected while performing the inpregnation steps.<br>
The treatment ends by increasing the vacuum chamber absolute pressure up to the atmospheric pressure, emptying the solution with an extraction device not being shown. In a preferred embodiment the same injection device is used for extracting the impregnating fluid, i.e. the pipes 25 and 28, the solenoid valve 27 and the filter 26, trapping impurities- At this point the materials being treated are extracted from the vacuum chamber 8.<br>
The so-emptied vacuiim chamber is washed only with water, which is sprayed, by the pipes 32 in the chamber 8 being emptied of the slice cluster 7, in order to allow the silicate residues to be removed and the following cycle to be performed. The drainage of the solution first and of the washing water then is performed by a suitable device of the vacuum chamber 8, which, can be different from the "V"-shaped bottom 24 being shown. The washing water can be easily discharged, being it inert.<br>
The impregnating solution can be used, several times taking care to verify , the : component percentages and not to use it as opacity appears, since it indicates the separation of a new-phase.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method continues with a following seasoning step performed by thermal treatment in.a controlled-temperature chamber, i.e. in the seasoning<br>
 <br>
chamber 12 of the seasoning station 11. Temperatures are kept constant in chamber 12 and advantageously different from each other, however such as not to expose the material to thermal stresses, ensuring the heating and the progressive dehydration of the silicate binder impregnated in the rock. The seasoning preferably occurs at a temperature comprised between 40 and 60°C and in controlled relative moisture conditions, preferably comprised between 40-75% UR. The seasoning time is needed for the impregnant to effectively act considerably increasing the mechanical properties of the rocky material being treated. The times being detected during the test, al though not binding, varies between 1 and 7 days for optimum results. In any case it has been checked that too long seasoning or permanency times, even 28 days, after the treatment lead in some ornamental stones a light decrease in the achieved benefits.<br>
The present invention also comprises the possibility of more applications of the same water glass solution or of different water glass solutions on the same cluster of semifinished products or materials with aims, which can be different according to the typology of the ornamental rock being treated.<br>
More cycles alternated with seasoning steps can be performed for the following aims:<br>
a)	Act in a targeted way according to the structural aspect, particularly according to the Lithotype porosities and/or fracture degree;<br>
b)	Accentuating the treatment chromatic effects; the following applications can then be performed with the same impregnant formulation suitable for the lithotype to be treated.<br>
In the case of multiple applications, chosen in a targeted way according to the structural aspect, the following applications can be distinguished:<br>
al) rock with small closed fractures without rough.^porosity:; in that case more' applications:. of the same formulation can ensure both the pervasive  impregnation  and  the  consolidation  of  the  existing fractures; a2)  rock  with  middle-sized  fractures  or  with  varia±&gt;le-sized<br>
 <br>
fractures up to open fractures, and pore radius less than Imm; in that case two or more applications with two different aims are suggested: firstly to consolidate in a pervasive way the rock sound portion, the one without fractures and less than 1mm porosities; secondly to seal the fractures with a tackier and more viscous consolidant better adhering to the rock and particularly to the consolidant layer left by the previous application.<br>
The second treatment adheres more to the porosities both because of the different physical properties thereof, particularly the higher viscosity and stickiness, and because it tends to adhere to the water glass layer formed in the previous application creating necks and bridges in the porosities. The sealing power of the second treatment is thus increased by the previous treatment.<br>
The second application caui be performed with very viscous and sealing solutions also produced by adding in-suspension and/or in-solution charges. In some cases the addition of suitable quantities of charges reduces to one or few applications the solution average life but the charge addition can be required for an application aimed to fractured and/or porous rocks. It is possible to add charges in calcite suspension or aluminous cement. In the-solution additives can be added in lower quantities, chosen between the several curing agents existing for water glass solutions, than a limdt value varying with the silicate formulation. More concentrated,. curing agent solutions can be applied apart as a stabilising and reactive treatment of the silicate inpregnant to accelerate hardening times and increase the silicate inpregnant resistance to moisture and water in the pores.<br>
The above-described method is applied to end-items or. to semifinished products, i.e. to rock pieces obtained by cutting a block in any shape being functional to the following working. The consolidation treatment:; can involve one or more working stages intervening on semifinished products from raw to almost finished. For example semifinished products being about 5-40 mm thick can be treated, in the step preceding the final working of the production of  polished  floor  tiles.  The  technique  can  be  applied  on<br>
 <br>
semifinished products with a different surface width (even large-sized semifinished products such as plates) and thickniess (5-40mm) , meeting the requirements of the different kinds of working and final application of the product. Moreover it is possible to apply the process several times, even in different semifinished product working stages.<br>
A  further  aspect  of  the  present  invention  relates  to  the<br>
formulation of the more suitable impregnant for the different lithotypes, to the chemical composition and structural aspect thereof.<br>
From tests carried out it has been detected that a formulation being suitable for a single pervasive treatment in the cases of less porous sound stones without fractures, i.e. type al) , or suitable for a first treatment in the cases of fractured and porous stones, i.e. type a2) , is particularly effective on fine-medium-grained granite stones, like granites commercially known as "Sardinian White" and "Imperial White", or variable-grained like the migmatite "Multicolor", i.e. all with a quartzose-feldspathic composition up to labradorithic compositions, is formulated by the following three components:<br>
A)	Sodium waterglass (with a ratio Si02/Na20 comprised between 1.8<br>
and 3.8, preferably comprised between 3.0 and 3.5, and solids comprised between 25 and 50% by weight, preferably comprised between 30 and 40%) in the percentage comprised between 40 and 80% by weight;<br>
B)	Potassium waterglass (with a ratio Si02/K20 comprised between<br>
0.6 and 2.2, preferably comprised between 0.6 and 1.0, and solids comprised between 35 and 50% by weight, preferably comprised between 45 and 50%) in the percentage comprised between 20 and 50% by weight;<br>
C)	H2O in the percentage comprised between 0 and 25% by weight.<br>
The most effective silicate mixture in water solution, and the first or single impregnation treatment of "granite"-like rocks is, as above described, a sodium potassium mixture with a higher concentration of sodium solution.<br>
 <br>
In the wide range of rocks included in the granite commercial category, it has been found out that for rocks with a more basic composition, such as for example fine-grained very compact basalt having a high initial mechanical resistance, like the ones commercially known as "Absolute Black", the most effective treatment is performed with a solution being more rich in potassium and very fluid,  comprising  potassium  waterglass  (with  a  ratio  Si02/K20<br>
comprised between 0.6 and 1, preferably of 0.6, and solids comprised between 40 and 50% by weight, preferably comprised between 45 and 50%) in the percentage comprised between 80 and 100% by weight and water comprised between 0 and 20%.<br>
From tests carried out it has been detected that for aj^lication following the first one, i.e. in the case of multiple applications requiring the application of a viscous solution (150-500 mps a 20°C) with a slightly sealing effect,  the solutions with the higher binding power are composed of sodium silicate (with a ratio Si02/Na20<br>
comprised between 3.2 and 4.0, and solids comprised between 30 and 35% by weight) in the percentage of 100% by weight.<br>
The viscosity and the sealing power of this solution can be increased by adding in~suspension charges for applications aimed to rocks with a high degree of porosity and fracture.<br>
Compositions being richer in potassium silicate have a higher consolidating effect if the thermal seasoning is performed at a higher temperature. Solutions only containing potassium silicate with Si02/K20 comprised between 0.6 and 1,  and solids comprised<br>
between 40 and 50% by weight require seasoning temperatures exceeding 50°C, and preferably of 60°C.<br>
In carrying out the tests, it has been verified that water glass solutions used to deeply consolidate ornamental stones, besides improving the mechanical properties thereof, also offer considerable aesthetical benefits such as: more brightness, more purity and natural colour definition. This effect being never described before<br>
 <br>
and absolutely unexpected is particularly advantageous since it allows two significant features of ornamental rock to be improved in a single treatment: the mechanical resistance thereof, so to realise thin coating plates and the appearance thereof with a considerable improvement of the surface aesthetical values<br>
From tests carried out, the ispregnating silicate penetration resulted of about 5-6 mm in the thickness of a 30 mm thick plate.<br>
The operation of the plant as described and represented in the figures is already apparent from the above description of the method. It is still to specify that the fingers 53, 58 equipping the frame 50 and the "L" closing arms for the whole method duration, support the cluster 7 of slices 1. These fingers are positioned to keep the slices apart at a minimum distance, but sufficient for the impregnating fluid so that it can penetrate between the facing surfaces and act under the effect of the applied pressures. Said distance is also calculated based on the fluid viscosity at the end of the impregnation in order to let the fluid drip, i.e. the surplus water glass solution, releasing the slices 1 being treated. The "L" arms are connected to the frame by known dissolvable mechanical joints, not shown for simplicity, they are clamped to the composition of the slice cluster 7 and they are open at the end of the slice extraction method.<br>
The advantages obtained by this invention are: the treatment method allows the rock porosities and fractures to be sealed and then the end-item, and advantageously the seiaif inished product mechanical properties to be improved, particularly improving the flexural strength and the modulus of elasticity. The achievable consolidation allows for example more resistant semifinished products to be realised, i.e. suitable to stand all the following working steps which very often expose the rock at high mechanioal stresses.<br>
The repetition of the impregnation steps, with the same aims or with different aims in the different steps, allows the mechanical features  to be gradually improved even by more than twice the<br>
 <br>
mechanical features of the initial rock.<br>
The so-realised end-iteias show higher mechanical properties than similar untreated products.<br>
Moreover, the consolidation treatment allows the ornamental stone aesthetical properties to be improved ensuring a better result for the polishing operation, accentuating the rock natural colours and for the different surface aspect since the porosities and the fissures are sealed, just as it is possible to add also some pigment to the solution or coloured charged material for embellishment purposes.<br>
The present invention thus links to the rock consolidation advantages a clear embellishment effect of the rock being worked.<br>
In the present invention the main advantages, with respect to the prior art, are achieved because the exhaustion process, representing the device favouring the natural fluid infiltration by capillarity, is performed with very high vacuum values in a different pre-treatment step, requiring the application of a negative pressure lower than predetermined impregnation values. In this pre-treatment the certain removal of powders, absorbed gas and excess of humidity from the porosities is achieved, contrary to the prior art described in the patent EP 651842 wherein said inclusions are compressed and incorporated in micro-cavities in the consolidated silicate material.<br>
The impregnating solution based on water glass solutions can be also used for some hundreds of impregnations, only previously visually controlling the transparency and the component concentration.<br>
A further advantage with respect to the prior art is the fact of comprising also a seasoning step of the impregnated semi finished materials, to be implemented according to the kind of consolidant and of the chemical, physical and morphological features of the material being treated, i.e. the. lithdtype. In fact, it has been -verified that the seasoning allows the mechanical properties to be considerably increased with respect to the only-impregnated semifinished product.<br>
From tests carried out, an improvement of the production yield has<br>
 <br>
been detected, with a reduction of the scraps from breaking by 60%.<br>
In the practical implementation, the materials, sizes, execution details could be different from the indicated ones, but technically similar thereto, without departing from the juridical scope of the present invention.<br>
