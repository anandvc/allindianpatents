				<td>THIOTUNGSTATE ANALOGUES AND USES THEREOF<br>
1.	Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to tetrathiotungstate derivatives,<br>
methods of making novel tetrathiotungstate derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of novel tetrathiotungstate derivatives, methods of using novel tetrathiotungstate<br>
derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions of tetrathiotungstate derivatives to treat<br>
or prevent diseases associated with aberrant vascularization, copper metabolism<br>
disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and obesity.<br>
2.	Background<br>
Most forms of cancer are derived from solid tumors (Shockley et al., Ann. N Y.<br>
Acad. Sci. 1991, 617: 367-382, which have proven resistant in the clinic to therapies<br>
such as the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins. Anti-angiogenic therapy<br>
for the treatment of cancer was developed from the recognition that solid tumors<br>
require angiogenesis (i.e., new blood vessel formation) for sustained growth<br>
(Folkman, Ann. Surg. 1972, 175: 409-416; Folkman, Mol. Med. 1995, 1(2): 120-122;<br>
Folkman, Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995, 36(2): 109-118; Hanahan et al., Cell 1996,<br>
86(3): 353-364). Efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy in animal models has been<br>
demonstrated (Millauer et al., Cancer Res. 1996, 56:1615-1620; Borgstrom et al.,<br>
Prostrate 1998, 35:1-10; Benjamin et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1999, 103: 159-165;<br>
Merajver et al., Proceedings of Special AACR Conference on Angiogenesis and<br>
Cancer 1998, Abstract #B-11, January 22-24). In the absence of angiogenesis,<br>
internal cell layers of solid tumors are inadequately nourished. Further, angiogenesis<br>
(i.e., aberrant vascularization) has been implicated in numerous other diseases (e.g.,<br>
ocular neovascular disease, macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). More<br>
recently, angiogenesis inhibition has been directly correlated with adipose tissue loss<br>
and weight loss in animal models, which suggests anti-angiogenic therapy may be<br>
useful in prevention of obesity (Rupnick et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002,<br>
99,:10730-10735).<br>
Contrastingly, normal tissue does not require angiogenesis except under<br>
specialized circumstances (e.g., wound repair, proliferation of the internal lining of<br>
the uterus during the menstrual cycle, etc.). Accordingly, a requirement for<br>
angiogenesis is a significant difference between tumor cells and normal tissue.<br><br>
Importantly, the dependency of tumor cells on angiogenesis, when compared to<br>
normal cells, is quantitatively greater than differences in cell replication and cell<br>
death, between normal tissue and tumor tissue, which are often exploited in cancer<br>
therapy.<br>
Angiogenesis requires copper, as has been shown by numerous studies (Parke<br>
et al., Am. J. Pathol 1988, 137:173-178; Raju et al., Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982, 69:<br>
1183-1188; Ziche et al., Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982, 69: 475-482; Gullino, Anticancer<br>
Res. 1986,6(2): 153-158). Attempts at preventing angiogenesis and hence tumor<br>
growth in animal models by reducing in vivo amounts of copper have been reported in<br>
the art (Brem et al., Neurosurgery 1990, 26:391-396; Brem et al., Am. J. Pathol.<br>
1990, 137(5): 1121-1142; Yoshida et al., Neurosurgery 1995 37(2): 287-295). These<br>
approaches incorporated both copper chelators and low copper diets. More recently,<br>
Brewer et al., International Application No. PCT/US99/20374 have shown that the<br>
copper chelators, (e.g., tetrathiomolybdate) may be effective in treating diseases (e.g.,<br>
solid tumor growth), which require angiogenesis.<br>
In addition to the induction of angiogenesis, copper may also have a direct role<br>
- in tumor cell growth and survival. High copper levels exist in both the plasma and in<br>
tumor tissue from patients with many different solid cancers (Chakravarty et al., J<br>
Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1984, 108: 312-315). Recently, tetrathiomolybdate has been<br>
shown to down-regulate the expression of NF-KB as well as inhibit its translocation to<br>
the nucleus in the inflammatory breast cancer cell line SUM 149 (Pan et al., Cancer<br>
Res. 2002, 62: 4854-4859). The NF-KB system may be involved in mediating tumor<br>
cell survival and thus its down-regulation in tumor cells by tetrathiomolybdate<br>
suggests a direct effect of copper chelation on tumor survival.<br>
Accordingly, novel compounds such as tetrathiotungstate compounds, which<br>
are copper chelators, are required to fully explore the potential of copper chelators in<br>
treating and/or preventing angiogenesis and in tumor cell viability. Such novel<br>
tetrathiotungstate compounds may be effective in treating various diseases associated<br>
with angiogenesis such as cancer and obesity along with copper metabolism disorders<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, obesity as well as treating diseases where the NF-KB<br>
pathway is dysregulated such as inflammatory disorders.<br><br>

structure and/or chemical name. When the chemical structure and chemical name<br>
conflict, the chemical structure is determinative of the identity of the compound.<br>
Compounds may contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and<br>
therefore, may exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric<br>
isomers), enantiomers or diastereomers. Accordingly, the chemical structures<br>
depicted herein encompass all possible enantiomers and stereoisomers of the<br>
illustrated compounds including the stereoisomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically<br>
pure, enantiomerically pure or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and<br>
stereoisomeric mixtures. Enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures can be resolved<br>
into their component enantiomers or stereoisomers using separation techniques or<br>
chiral synthesis techniques well known to the skilled artisan. Compounds may also<br>
exist in several tautomeric forms including the enol form, the keto form and mixtures<br>
thereof. Accordingly, the chemical structures depicted herein encompass all possible<br>
tautomeric forms of the illustrated compounds. Compounds also include isotopically<br>
labeled compounds where one or more atoms have an atomic mass different from the<br>
atomic mass conventionally found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be<br>
incorporated into the compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, 2H,<br>
3H, l3C, 14C, 15N, 18O,17O and 35S. Compounds may exist in unsolvated forms as well<br>
as solvated forms, including hydrated forms and as N-oxides. In general, the<br>
hydrated, solvated forms and N-oxides are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Certain compounds may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general,<br>
all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated herein. Further, it should<br><br>
be understood, when partial structures of the compounds are illustrated, that brackets<br>
indicate the point of attachment of the partial structure to the rest of the molecule.<br>

5.3 Synthesis of Compounds<br>
The compounds described herein may be obtained via conventional synthetic<br>
methods illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2. Starting materials useful for preparing<br>
compounds described herein and intermediates thereof are commercially available or<br>
can be prepared by well-known synthetic methods. Substituted ammonium salts (e.g.,<br>
ammonium hydroxide and ammonium halides) may be either purchased from<br>
commercial sources or may be readily synthesized using well-known synthetic<br><br>
methods (Harrison et al., "Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods", Vols. 1-8<br>
(John Wiley and Sons, 1971-1996); "Beilstein Handbook of Organic Chemistry,"<br>
Beilstein Institute of Organic Chemistry, Frankfurt, Germany; Feiser et al., "Reagents<br>
for Organic Synthesis," Volumes 1-17, Wiley Interscience; Trost et al.,<br>
"Comprehensive Organic Synthesis," Pergamon Press, 1991; "Theilheimer's<br>
Synthetic Methods of Organic Chemistry," Volumes 1-45, Karger, 1991; March,<br>
"Advanced Organic Chemistry," Wiley Interscience, 1991; Larock "Comprehensive<br>
Organic Transformations," VCH Publishers, 1989; Paquette, "Encyclopedia of<br>
Reagents for Organic Synthesis," John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1995). Other methods for<br>
synthesis of the compounds described herein and/or starting materials are either<br>
described in the art or will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Accordingly, the<br>
methods presented in Schemes 1 and 2 herein are illustrative rather than<br>
comprehensive.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
As shown above, in Scheme 1, addition of a quaternary ammonium hydroxide<br>
to thiotungstate in the presence of water leads to cation exchange (equilibrium to<br>
product is driven by removal of volatile ammonia) to provide the desired thiotungstate<br>
derivative.<br><br>
As shown above, in Scheme 2, addition of a quaternary ammonium halide to<br>
thiotungstate in the presence of acetonitrile leads to cation exchange (equilibrium to<br>
product is driven by formation of ammonium halide) to provide the desired<br>
thiotungstate derivative.<br><br>
It should be noted that thiotungstate derivatives where the ammonium<br>
counterions are different may be prepared from compounds 3 by treating with one<br>
equivalent of a different ammonium counterion. Such a reaction would be expected<br>
to produce a statistical mixture of products.<br>
Further, those of skill in the art will appreciate that conventional methods<br>
comprising treating tungstate with an ammonium salt and hydrogen sulfide may be<br>
used to synthesize many of the compounds described herein.<br>
5.4 Assays<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the in vitro and in vivo assays<br>
useful for measuring the activity of the compounds described herein are illustrative<br>
rather than comprehensive.<br>
5.4.1	Assay for Endothelial Cell Migration<br>
For endothelial cell migration, transwells are coated with type I collagen (50<br>
µg/mL) by adding 200 µL of the collagen solution per transwell, then incubating<br>
overnight at 37 °C. The transweils are assembled in a 24-well plate and a<br>
chemoattractant (e.g., FGF-2) is added to the bottom chamber in a total volume of 0.8<br>
mL media. Endothelial cells such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells<br>
("HUVEC"), which have been detached from monolayer culture using trypsin, are<br>
diluted to a final concentration of about 106 cells/mL with serum-free media and 0.2<br>
mL of this cell suspension is added to the upper chamber of each transwell. Inhibitors<br>
are added to both the upper and lower chambers, and the migration is allowed to<br>
proceed for 5 hrs in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C. The transweils are removed<br>
from the plate stained using DiffQuik®. Cells which did not migrate are removed<br>
from the upper chamber by scraping with a cotton swab and the membranes are<br>
detached, mounted on slides, and counted under a high-power field (400x) to<br>
determine the number of cells migrated.<br>
5.4.2	Biological Assay of Anti-Invasive Activity<br>
Compounds and/or compositions are tested for their anti-invasive capacity.<br>
The ability of cells such as endothelial cells or tumor cells (e.g., PC-3 human prostatic<br>
carcinoma) cells to invade through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel®)<br><br>
in an assay known as a Matrigel® invasion assay (Kleinman et al., Biochemistry<br>
1986, 25: 312-318; Parish et al., Int. J. Cancer 1992, 52:378-383). Matrigel® is a<br>
reconstituted basement membrane containing type IV collagen, laminin, heparan<br>
sulfate proteoglycans such as perlecan, which bind to and localize bFGF, vitronectin<br>
as well as transforming growth factor- (TGF\ urokinase-type plasminogen activator<br>
(uPA), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the serpin known as plasminogen<br>
activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1)) (Chambers et al., Canc. Res. 1995, 55:1578-1585).<br>
Results obtained in this assay for compounds which target extracellular receptors or<br>
enzymes are typically predictive of the efficacy of these compounds in vivo (Rabbani<br>
et al., 1995, Int. J. Cancer 63: 840-845).<br>
Such assays employ transwell tissue culture inserts. Invasive cells are defined<br>
as cells which are able to traverse through the Matrigel® and upper aspect of a<br>
polycarbonate membrane and adhere to the bottom of the membrane. Transwells<br>
(Costar) containing polycarbonate membranes (8.0 µm pore size) are coated with<br>
Matrigel® (Collaborative Research), which has been diluted in sterile PBS to a final<br>
concentration of 75 µg/mL (60 µL of diluted Matrigel® per insert), and placed in the<br>
wells of a 24-well plate. The membranes are dried overnight in a biological safety<br>
cabinet, then rehydrated by adding 100 µL of DMEM containing antibiotics for 1<br>
hour on a shaker table. The DMEM is removed from each insert by aspiration and 0.8<br>
mL of DMEM/10 % FBS/antibiotics is added to each well of the 24-well plate such<br>
that it surrounds the outside of the transwell ("lower chamber"). Fresh DMEM/<br>
antibiotics (100L), human Glu-plasminogen (5 µg/mL), and any compounds to be<br>
tested are added to the top, inside of the transwell ("upper chamber"). The cells<br>
which are to be tested are trypsinized and resuspended in DMEM/antibiotics, then<br>
added to the top chamber of the transwell at a final concentration of 800,000 cells/mL.<br>
The final volume of the upper chamber is adjusted to 200 pL. The assembled plate is<br>
then incubated in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 hours. After incubation, the<br>
cells are fixed and stained using DiffQuik® (Giemsa stain) and the upper chamber is<br>
then scraped using a cotton swab to remove the Matrigel® and any cells which did not<br>
invade through the membrane. The membranes are detached from the transwell using<br>
an X-acto® blade, mounted on slides using Permount® and cover-slips, then counted<br>
under a high-powered (400x) field. An average of the cells invaded is determined<br>
from 5-10 fields counted and plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration.<br><br>
5.4.3 Tube-Formation Assays of Anti-Angiogenic Activity<br>
Compounds may be tested for anti-angiogenic activity in one of two different<br>
assay systems in vitro.<br>
Endothelial cells, for example, human umbilical vein endothelial cells<br>
("HUVEC") or human microvascular endothelial cells ("HMVEC") which can be<br>
prepared or obtained commercially, are mixed at a concentration of 2 x 105 cells/mL<br>
with fibrinogen (5mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline ("PBS") in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio.<br>
Thrombin is added (5 units/mL final concentration) and the mixture is immediately<br>
transferred to a 24-well plate (0.5 mL per well). The fibrin gel is allowed to form and<br>
then VEGF and bFGF are added to the wells (each at 5 ng/mL final concentration)<br>
along with the test compound. The cells are incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days<br>
at which time the cells in each well are counted and classified as either rounded,<br>
elongated with no branches, elongated with one branch, or elongated with 2 or more<br>
branches. Results are expressed as the average of 5 different wells for each<br>
concentration of compound. Typically, in the presence of angiogenic inhibitors, cells<br>
remain either rounded or form undifferentiated tubes (e.g., 0 or 1 branch). This assay<br>
is recognized in the art to be predictive of angiogenic (or anti-angiogenic) efficacy in<br>
vivo (Min et al., Cancer Res. 1996, 56: 2428-2433).<br>
In an alternate assay, endothelial cell tube formation is observed when<br>
endothelial cells are cultured on Matrigel® (Schnaper et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 1995,<br>
 (165:107-1 18). Endothelial cells (1 x1O4 cells/well) are transferred onto Matrigel®-<br>
coated 24-well plates and tube formation is quantitated after 48 hours. Inhibitors are<br>
tested by addition at either the same time as the endothelial cells or at various time<br>
points thereafter. Tube formation can also be stimulated by adding angiogenic growth<br>
factors such as bFGF or VEGF, differentiation stimulating agents {e.g., PMA) or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
This assay models angiogenesis by presenting a particular type of basement<br>
membrane to the endothelial cells, namely the layer of matrix, which migrating and<br>
differentiating endothelial cells might be expected to first encounter. In addition, the<br>
matrix components found in Matrigel® (and in basement membranes in situ) or<br>
proteolytic products thereof may also be stimulatory for endothelial cell tube<br>
formation which makes this model complementary to the fibrin gel angiogenesis<br>
model previously described (Blood et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1990, 7052:89-118;<br><br>
Odedra et al., Pharmac. Ther. 1991, 49: 111-124). The compounds inhibit endothelial<br>
cell tube formation in both assays, which suggests that the compounds will also have<br>
anti-angiogenic activity.<br>
5.4.4 Assays for Inhibition of Proliferation<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells<br>
may be determined in a 96-well format. Type I collagen (gelatin) is used to coat the<br>
wells of the plate (0.1-1 mg/mL in PBS, 0.1 mL per well for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature). After washing the plate (3x w/PBS), 3-6,000 cells are plated per well<br>
and allowed to attach for 4 hours (37 °C/5% CO2) in Endothelial Growth Medium<br>
(EGM; Clonetics) or M199 media containing 0.1-2% FBS. The media and any<br>
unattached cells are removed at the end of 4 hours and fresh media containing bFGF<br>
(1-10 ng/mL) or VEGF (1-10 ng/mL) is added to each well. Compounds to be tested<br>
are added last and the plate is allowed to incubate (37 °C/5% CO2) for 24-48 hrs.<br>
MTS (Promega) is added to each well and allowed to incubate from 1-4 hrs. The<br>
absorbance at 490nm, which is proportional to the cell number, is then measured to<br>
determine the differences in proliferation between control wells and those containing<br>
test compounds. A similar assay system can be set up with cultured adherent tumor<br>
cells. However, collagen may be omitted in this format. Tumor cells (e.g., 3,000-<br>
10,000/well) are plated and allowed to attach overnight. Serum free medium is then<br>
added to the wells and the cells are synchronized for 24 hrs. Medium containing 10%<br>
FBS is then added to each well to stimulate proliferation. Compounds to be tested are<br>
included in some of the wells. After 24 hrs, MTS is added to the plate and the assay<br>
developed and read as described above. A similar methodology may also be<br>
employed to evaluate the effects of the compounds of the invention on the<br>
proliferation of other cell types including tumor cells except that VEGF and bFGF<br>
would not be used to stimulate growth of the cells. If there is evidence of antiproliferative<br>
 activity, induction of apoptosis may be measured using TumorTACS<br>
(Genzyme).<br>
5.4.5 Assays of Cytotoxicity<br>
The cytotoxic effects of compounds described herein may be determined for<br>
various cell types including tumor cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and<br>
macrophages.<br><br>
A typical assay involves plating cells at a density of 5-10,000 cells per well in<br>
a 96-well plate. Compounds are then added at a variety of concentrations and allowed<br>
to incubate with the cells for 24 hours. The cells are washed 3X with media. For<br>
cytotoxicity assays (measuring cell lysis), a Promega 96-well cytotoxicity kit is used.<br>
5.4.6 Corneal Angiogenesis Model<br>
The protocol used is essentially identical to that described by Volpert et al., J.<br>
Clin. Invest. 1996, 95:671-679. Briefly, female Fischer rats (120-140 gms) are<br>
anesthetized and pellets (5 µl) comprised of Hydron®, bFGF (150 nM) and the<br>
compounds to be tested are implanted into tiny incisions made in the cornea 1.0-1.5<br>
mm from the limbus. Neovascularization is assessed at 5 and 7 days after<br>
implantation. On day 7, animals are anesthetized and infused with a dye such as<br>
colloidal carbon to stain the vessels. The animals are then euthanized, the corneas<br>
fixed with formalin, and the corneas flattened and photographed to assess the degree<br>
of neovascularization. Neovessels may be quantitated by imaging the total vessel area<br>
or length or simply by counting vessels.<br>
5.4.7 Matrigel® Plug Assay<br>
This assay is performed essentially as described by Passaniti et al., Lab Invest.<br>
1992, 67:519-528. Ice-cold Matrigel® (e.g., 500 uL) (Collaborative Biomedical<br>
Products, Inc., Bedford, MA) is mixed with heparin (e.g., 50 µg/ml), FGF-2 (e.g., 400<br>
ng/ml) and the compound to be tested. In some assays, bFGF may be substituted with<br>
tumor cells as the angiogenic stimulus. The Matrigel® mixture is injected<br>
subcutaneously into 4-8 week-old athymic nude mice at sites near the abdominal<br>
midline, preferably 3 injections per mouse. The injected Matrigel® forms a palpable<br>
solid gel. Injection sites are chosen such that each animal receives a positive control<br>
plug (such as FGF-2 + heparin), a negative control plug (e.g., buffer + heparin) and a<br>
plug that includes the compound being tested for its effect on angiogenesis (e.g., FGF-<br>
2 + heparin + compound). All treatments are preferably run in triplicate. Animals are<br>
sacrificed by cervical dislocation at about 7 days post injection or another time that<br>
may be optimal for observing angiogenesis. The mouse skin is detached along the<br>
abdominal midline, and the Matrigel® plugs are recovered and scanned immediately<br><br>
at high resolution. Plugs are then dispersed in water and incubated at 37°C overnight.<br>
Hemoglobin (Hb) levels are determined using Drabkin's solution (e.g., obtained from<br>
Sigma) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The amount of Hb in the plug is<br>
an indirect measure of angiogenesis as it reflects the amount of blood in the sample.<br>
In addition, or alternatively, animals may be injected prior to sacrifice with a 0.1 ml<br>
buffer (preferably PBS) containing a high molecular weight dextran to which is<br>
conjugated a fluorophore. The amount of fluorescence in the dispersed plug which is<br>
determined fluorimetrically serves as a measure of angiogenesis in the plug. Staining<br>
with mAb anti-CD31 (CD31 is platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule or<br>
"PECAM") may also be used to confirm neovessel formation and microvessel density<br>
in the plugs.<br>
5.4.8 Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assay<br>
This assay is performed essentially as described by Nguyen et al.,<br>
Microvascular Res. 1994, 47:31-40. A mesh containing either angiogenic factors<br>
(bFGF) or tumor cells plus inhibitors is placed onto the CAM of an 8-day old chick<br>
embryo and the CAM observed for 3-9 days after implantation of the sample.<br>
Angiogenesis is quantitated by determining the percentage of squares in the mesh<br>
which contain blood vessels.<br>
5.4.9 In Vivo Assessment Angiogenesis Inhibition and Anti-Tumor Effects<br>
Using the Matrigel® Plug Assay with Tumor Cells<br>
In this assay, tumor cells, for example, 1-5 x 106 cells of the 3LL Lewis lung<br>
carcinoma or the rat prostate cell line MatLyLu, are mixed with Matrigel® and then<br>
injected into the flank of a mouse following the protocol described in section 4.4.7<br>
above. A mass of tumor cells and a powerful angiogenic response can be observed in<br>
the plugs after about 5 to 7 days. The anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic action of a<br>
compound in an actual tumor environment can be evaluated by including it in the<br>
plug. Measurement is then made of tumor weight, Hb levels or fluorescence levels<br>
(of a dextran-fiuorophore conjugate injected prior to sacrifice). To measure Hb or<br>
fluorescence, the plugs are first homogenized with a tissue homogenizer.<br><br>
5.4.10	Xenograft Model of Subcutaneous Tumor Growth<br>
Nude mice are inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells (human breast carcinoma)<br>
and Matrigel® (1 x 106 cells in 0.2mL) subcutaneously in the right flank of the<br>
animals. The tumors are staged to 200 mm3 and then treatment with a test compound<br>
is initiated. Tumor volumes are obtained every other day and the animals are<br>
sacrificed after 2 weeks of treatment. The tumors are excised, weighed and paraffin<br>
embedded. Histological sections of the tumors are analyzed by H and E, anti-CD31,<br>
Ki-67, TUNEL, and CD68 staining.<br>
Other human tumor cell lines including but not limited to PC-3, CWR22R,<br>
SK-OV-3, A2780, A549, HCT116, HT29 may also be used to test the anti-tumor<br>
activity of the compounds described herein in a similar manner.<br>
5.4.11	Xenograft Model of Metastasis<br>
The compounds may also be tested for inhibition of late metastasis using an<br>
experimental metastasis model (Crowley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1993, 90<br>
5021-5025). Late metastasis involves the steps of attachment and extravasation of<br>
tumor cells, local invasion, seeding, proliferation and angiogenesis. Human prostatic<br>
carcinoma cells (PC-3) transfected with a reporter gene, preferably the green<br>
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, but as an alternative with a gene encoding the<br>
enzymes chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT), luciferase or LacZ, are<br>
inoculated into nude mice. This approach permits utilization of either of these<br>
markers (fluorescence detection of GFP or histochemical colorimetric detection of<br>
enzymatic activity) to follow the fate of these cells. Cells are injected, preferably, i.v.,<br>
and metastases identified after about 14 days, particularly in the lungs but also in<br>
regional lymph nodes, femurs and brain. This mimics the organ tropism of naturally<br>
occurring metastases in human prostate cancer. For example, GFP-expressing PC-3<br>
cells (1x106 cells per mouse) are injected i.v. into the tail veins of nude (nu/nu) mice.<br>
Animals are treated with a test composition at 100µg/animal/day given q.d. IP. Single<br>
metastatic cells and foci are visualized and quantitated by fluorescence microscopy or<br>
light microscopic histochemistry or by grinding the tissue and quantitative<br>
colorimetric assay of the detectable label.<br><br>
5.4.12 Inhibition of Spontaneous Metastasis In Vivo by HPRG and Functional<br>
Derivatives<br>
The rat syngeneic breast cancer system (Xing et al., Int. J. Cancer 1996,<br>
67:423-429) employs Mat BIII rat breast cancer cells. Tumor cells, for example about<br>
106 suspended in 0.1 mL PBS, are inoculated into the mammary fat pads of female<br>
Fisher rats. At the time of inoculation, a 14-day Alza osmotic mini-pump is<br>
implanted intraperitoneally to dispense the test compound. The compound is<br>
dissolved in PBS (e.g., 200 mM stock), sterile filtered and placed in the minipump to<br>
achieve a release rate of about 4 mg/kg/day. Control animals receive vehicle (PBS)<br>
alone or a vehicle control peptide in the mini-pump. Animals are sacrificed at about<br>
day 14.<br>
Other models of experimental metastasis may also be used to evaluate the<br>
compounds described herein. These models would utilize the human tumor cell lines<br>
described, supra, injected through the tail vein of a nude mouse. Typically, these<br>
mice are sacrificed 28 days after tumor cell inoculation and their lungs evaluated for<br>
the presence of metastases.<br>
5.4.13 3LL Lewis Lung Carcinoma: Primary Tumor Growth<br>
This tumor line arose spontaneously in 1951 as carcinoma of the lung in a<br>
C57BL/6 mouse (Cancer Res. 1955, 15:39. See, also Malave et al.,J. Nat'l. Canc.<br>
Inst. 1979, 62:83-88). It is propagated by passage in C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous<br>
inoculation and is tested in semiallogeneic C57BL/6 x DBA/2 F1 mice or in<br>
allogeneic C3H mice. Typically six animals per group for subcutaneously implant, or<br>
ten for intramuscular implant are used. Tumor may be implanted by subcutaneous<br>
inoculation as a 2-4 mm fragment or intramuscularly implanted or subcutaneous<br>
implanted as an inoculum of suspended cells of about 0.5-2 x 106-cells. Treatment<br>
begins 24 hours after implant or is delayed until a rumor of specified size (usually<br>
approximately 400 mg) can be palpated. The test compound is administered i.p. daily<br>
for 11 days<br>
Animals are followed by weighing, palpation, and measurement of tumor size.<br>
Typical tumor weight in untreated control recipients on day 12 after intramuscular<br>
inoculation is 500-2500 mg. Typical median survival time is 18-28 days. A positive<br>
control compound, for example, cyclophosphamide at 20 mg/kg/injection per day on<br>
days 1-11 is used. Results computed include mean animal weight, tumor size, tumor<br><br>
weight and survival time. For confirmed therapeutic activity, the test composition<br>
should be tested in two multi-dose assays.<br>
5.4.14 3LL Lewis Lung Carcinoma: Primary Growth and Spontaneous<br>
Metastasis Model<br>
This model has been utilized by a number of investigators (See, for example,<br>
Gorelik et al., 1980, J. Nat'l. Cane. Inst. 65:1257-1264; Gorelik et al., Rec. Results<br>
Cane. Res. 1980, 75:20-28; Isakov et al., Invasion Metas. 1982, 2:12-32; Talmadge et<br>
al., J. Nat'l. Cane. Inst. 1982, 69:975-980; Hilgard et al., Br. J. Cancer 1977,<br>
35:78-86). Test mice are male C57BL/6 mice, 2-3 months old. Following<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular or intra-footpad implantation, this tumor produces<br>
metastases, preferentially in the lungs. With some lines of the tumor, the primary<br>
tumor exerts anti-metastatic effects and must first be excised before study of the<br>
metastatic phase (see also, O'Reilly et al., United States Patent No. 5,639,725).<br>
Single-cell suspensions are prepared from solid tumors by treating minced<br>
tumor tissue with a solution of 0.3% trypsin. Cells are washed 3 times with PBS (pH<br>
7.4) and suspended in PBS. Viability of the 3LL cells prepared in this way is<br>
generally about 95-99% (by trypan blue dye exclusion). Viable tumor cells (3 x 104 -<br>
5 x 106) suspended in 0.05 ml PBS are injected subcutaneously, either in the dorsal<br>
region or into one hind foot pad of C57BL/6 mice. Visible tumors appear after 3-4<br>
days after dorsal sc injection of 106 cells. The day of tumor appearance and the<br>
diameters of established tumors are measured by caliper every two days.<br>
The treatment is given as one or two doses of compound, per week. In another<br>
embodiment, the compound is delivered by osmotic minipump.<br>
In experiments involving tumor excision of dorsal tumors, when tumors reach<br>
about 1500 mm3 in size, mice are randomized into two groups: (1) primary tumor is<br>
completely excised; or (2) sham surgery is performed and the tumor is left intact.<br>
Although tumors from 500-3000 mm3 inhibit growth of metastases, 1500 mm3 is the<br>
largest size primary tumor that can be safely resected with high survival and without<br>
local regrowth. After 21 days, all mice are sacrificed and autopsied.<br>
Lungs are removed and weighed. Lungs are fixed in Bouin's solution and the<br>
number of visible metastases is recorded. The diameters of the metastases are also<br>
measured using a binocular stereoscope equipped with a micrometer-containing<br>
ocular under 8X magnification. On the basis of the recorded diameters, it is possible<br><br>
to calculate the volume of each metastasis. To determine the total volume of<br>
metastases per lung, the mean number of visible metastases is multiplied by the mean<br>
volume of metastases. To further determine metastatic growth, it is possible to<br>
measure incorporation of l25IdUrd into lung cells (Thakur et al.,J. Lab. Clin. Med.<br>
1977, 59:217-228). Ten days following tumor amputation, 25 µg of<br>
fluorodeoxyuridine is inoculated into the peritoneums of tumor-bearing (and, if used,<br>
tumor-resected mice). After 30 min, mice are given 1 µCi of125 IdUrd<br>
(iododeoxyuridine). One day later, lungs and spleens are removed and weighed and a<br>
degree of 125IdUrd incorporation is measured using a gamma counter.<br>
In mice with footpad tumors, when tumors reach about 8-10 mm in diameter,<br>
mice are randomized into two groups: (1) legs with tumors are amputated after<br>
ligation above the knee joints; or (2) mice are left intact as nonamputated tumor-<br>
bearing controls. (Amputation of a tumor-free leg in a tumor-bearing mouse has no<br>
known effect on subsequent metastasis, ruling out possible effects of anesthesia, stress<br>
or surgery). Mice are killed 10-14 days after amputation. Metastases are evaluated as<br>
described above.<br>
5.5 Therapeutic Uses<br>
A compound of structural formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical composition<br>
thereof is administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering from a disease<br>
characterized by aberrant vascularization. Aberrant vascularization includes<br>
abnormal neovascularization such as the formation of new blood vessels, larger blood<br>
vessels, more branched blood vessels and any other mechanism, which leads to an<br>
increased blood carrying capacity to a diseased tissue or site. The compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be used to treat and/or prevent aberrant<br>
vascularization.<br>
Preferably, diseases characterized by aberrant vascularization include, but are<br>
not limited to, cancer (e.g., any vascularized tumor, preferably, a solid tumor,<br>
including but not limited to, carcinomas of the lung, breast, ovary, stomach, pancreas,<br>
larynx, esophagus, testes, liver, parotid, bilary tract, colon, rectum, cervix, uterus,<br>
endometrium, kidney, bladder, prostrate, thyroid, squamous cell carcinomas,<br>
adenocarcinomas, small cell carcinomas, melanomas, gliomas, neuroblastomas,<br>

arteriovenous, malformations, corneal graft neovascularization, delayed wound<br><br>
healing, diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, granulations, bums,<br>
hemophilic joints, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertrophic scars, neovascular glaucoma,<br>
nonunion fractures, Osier Weber Syndrome, psoriasis, granuloma, retrolental<br>
fibroplasia, pterygium, scleroderma, trachoma, vascular adhesions, ocular<br>
neovascularization, parasitic diseases, hypertrophy following surgery, inhibition of<br>
hair growth, macular degeneration (including both wet and dry type), rheumatoid<br>
arthritis and osteoarthritis. Diseases characterized by aberrant vascularization which<br>
are preferably treated and/or prevented by administration of a compound of structural<br>
formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical composition thereof include cancer, macular<br>
degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Further, a compound of structural formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof may be administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering<br>
from a disease associated with copper metabolism disorders (e.g., Wilson's disease) to<br>
treat and/or prevent such a disease.<br>
Still further, a compound of structural formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof may be administered to a patient, preferably a human, to treat<br>
and/or prevent obesity. The compounds of structural formula (I) may be also used to<br>
reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-c, TNF-, IL-8, etc.) and<br>
plasminogen activator inhibitor, which may be associated with angiogenesis and<br>
obesity (Loskutoff et al., Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 2000, 902:272-281; Pan et al., Cancer<br>
Res., 2002, 62:4854-4859; Hanada et al., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002,<br>
13:413-421; Chen et al., Science 2002, 29(5:1634-5; Miyake et al.,J. Neuropathol.<br>
Exp. Neurol. 59:18-28; Koch et al., Science 1992, 255:1798-801; Osawa et al., Infect.<br>
Immun. 2002, 70:6294-6301; Bajou et al., Nat. Med. 1998, 4:923-8).<br>
Still further, a compound of structural formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof may be administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering<br>
from a neurodegenerative disorder, to treat and/or prevent the neurodegenerative<br>
disorder. Elevated levels of copper have been reported in the art to mediate the<br>
pathobiology of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease,<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disease (Llanos et al., DNA Cell Biol<br>
2002, 21: 259-270; Carri et al., Funct. Neurol 2001, 16:181-188; Perry et al., CNS<br>
Drugs 2002, 16:339-352; Kowalik-Jankowska et al., Environ Health Perspect, 2002,<br>
5: 869-870; Maynard et al., J. Biol Chem. 2002, 277, 44670-44676; Gnjec et al.,<br><br>
Front Biosci. 2002,16-23; Strausak et al, Brain Res. Bull. 2001, 55: 175-185; Brown,<br>
Brain Res. Bull. 2001, 55:165-173; Brown, Biochem. Soc. Trans 2002, 50:742-745).<br>
Still further, in accordance with the invention, a compound of structural<br>
formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical composition thereof may be administered to a<br>
patient, preferably a human, to treat diseases characterized by dysregulated activity of<br>
the NF-KB or dysregulated inflammation of inflammatory response.<br>
Further, in certain embodiments, a compounds and and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof are administered to a patient, preferably, a human, as a<br>
preventative measure against various diseases or disorders characterized by aberrant<br>
vascularization, copper metabolism disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity or<br>
NF-KB dysregulation. Accordingly, compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be used for the prevention of one disease or<br>
disorder and concurrently treating another (e.g., preventing Wilson's disease or<br>
Alzheimer's while treating cancer).<br>
5.6 Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration<br>
The compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
thereof may be advantageously used in human medicine. As previously described in<br>
Section 4.5, supra, compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of various<br>
diseases or disorders characterized by aberrant vascularization, copper metabolism<br>
disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity or NF-KB dysregulation.<br>
When used to treat and/or prevent the above disease or disorders, compounds<br>
of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions may be administered or<br>
applied singly, or in combination with other agents. The compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be administered or<br>
applied singly, in combination with other pharmaceutically active agents (e.g., other<br>
anti-cancer agents, other anti-angiogenic agents, other chelators such as zinc,<br>
penicillamine, etc. and other anti-obesity agents), including other compounds of<br>
structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof.<br>
Methods of treatment and prophylaxis by administration to a patient of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or<br><br>
pharmaceutical composition thereof are provided herein. The patient may be an<br>
animal, more preferably, a mammal and most preferably, a human.<br>
The present compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof, are preferably administered orally. The compounds of<br>
 structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be<br>
administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus<br>
injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral<br>
mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.). Administration can be systemic or local.<br>
Various delivery systems are known, (e.g., encapsulation in liposomes,<br>
 microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc.) that can be used to administer a<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual,<br>
intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically,<br>
particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The preferred mode of administration is<br>
left to the discretion of the practitioner and will depend in-part upon the site of the<br>
medical condition. In most instances, administration will result in the release of the<br>
compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof into<br>
the bloodstream.<br>
In specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer one or more<br>
compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof<br>
locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved, for example, and not<br>
by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in<br>
conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter,<br>
by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous,<br>
non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic<br>
membranes, or fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at<br>
the site (or former site) of aberrant vascularization (e.g., cancer or arthritis).<br>
In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to introduce one or more<br>
compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof into<br>
the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular,<br>
intrathecal and epidural injection. Intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an<br>
intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya<br>
reservoir.<br><br>
A compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition<br>
thereof may also be administered directly to the lung by inhalation. For<br>
administration by inhalation, a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or<br>
pharmaceutical composition thereof may be conveniently delivered to the lung by a<br>
number of different devices. For example, a Metered Dose Inhaler ("MDI"), which<br>
utilizes canisters that contain a suitable low boiling propellant, (e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon<br>
dioxide or any other suitable gas) may be used to deliver compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof directly to the lung.<br>
Alternatively, a Dry Powder Inhaler ("DPI") device may be used to administer<br>
a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical thereof to the lung. DPI<br>
devices typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create a cloud of dry<br>
powder inside a container, which may then be inhaled by the patient. DPI devices are<br>
also well known in the art. A popular variation is the multiple dose DPI ("MDDPI")<br>
system, which allows for the delivery of more than one therapeutic dose. For<br>
example, capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be<br>
formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of structural Formula (I) and a<br>
suitable powder base such as lactose or starch for these systems.<br>
Another type of device that may be used to deliver a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung is a liquid spray<br>
device supplied, for example, by Aradigm Corporation, Hayward, CA. Liquid spray<br>
systems use extremely small nozzle holes to aerosolize liquid drug formulations that<br>
may then be directly inhaled into the lung.<br>
In one embodiment, a nebulizer is used to deliver a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung. Nebulizers create<br>
aerosols from liquid drug formulations by using, for example, ultrasonic energy to<br>
form fine particles that may be readily inhaled (see e.g., Verschoyle et al., British J.<br>
Cancer, 1999, 80, Suppl. 2, 96). Examples of nebulizers include devices supplied by<br>
Sheffield Pharmaceuticals, Inc (See, Armer et al., United States Patent No. 5,954,047;<br>
van der Linden et al., United States Patent No. 5,950,619; van der Linden et al.,<br>
United States Patent No. 5,970,974), and Batelle Pulmonary Therapeutics, Columbus,<br>
OH.<br>
In another embodiment, an electrohydrodynamic ("EHD") aerosol device is<br>
used to deliver a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition thereof to the lung. EHD aerosol devices use electrical energy to<br>
aerosolize liquid drug solutions or suspensions (see e.g., Noakes et al., United States<br>
Patent No. 4,765,539). The electrochemical properties of the formulation may be<br>
important parameters to optimize when delivering a compound of structural Formula<br>
(I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung with an EHD aerosol device<br>
and such optimization is routinely performed by one of skill in the art. EHD aerosol<br>
devices may more efficiently deliver compounds to the lung than other pulmonary<br>
delivery technologies.<br>
In some embodiments, the compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a<br>
liposome (See, Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al., in "Liposomes in<br>
the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer," Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.),<br>
Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); see generally "Liposomes in the Therapy of<br>
Infectious Disease and Cancer," Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York,<br>
pp.353-365 (1989)).<br>
In other embodiments, the compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be delivered via sustained release systems,<br>
preferably oral sustained release systems. In one embodiment, a pump may be used<br>
(See, Langer, supra, Sefton, 1987, CRCCrit. Ref. BiomedEng. 14:201; Saudek et al.,<br>
1989, N. Engl. J Med. 321:574).<br>
In yet other embodiments, polymeric materials can be used (see "Medical<br>
Applications of Controlled Release," Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton,<br>
Florida (1974); "Controlled Drug Bioavailability," Drug Product Design and<br>
Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Langer et al., 1983, J<br>
Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:<br>
190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg.<br>
71:105). In still other embodiments, polymeric materials are used for oral sustained<br>
release delivery. Preferred polymers include sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose<br>
(most preferred, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose). Other preferred cellulose ethers<br>
have been described (Alderman, Int. J. Pharm. Tech. &amp; Prod. Mfr., 1984, 5(3) 1-9).<br>
Factors affecting drug release are well known to the skilled artisan and have been<br>
described in the art (Bamba et al., Int. J. Pharm., 1979, 2, 307).<br><br>
In still other embodiment, enteric-coated preparations can be used for oral<br>
sustained release administration. Preferred coating materials include polymers with a<br>
pH-dependent solubility (i.e., pH-controlled release), polymers with a slow or<br>
pH-dependent rate of swelling, dissolution or erosion {i.e., time-controlled release),<br>
polymers that are degraded by enzymes {i.e., enzyme-controlled release) and<br>
polymers that form firm layers that are destroyed by an increase in pressure {i.e.,<br>
pressure-controlled release).<br>
In still other embodiments, osmotic delivery systems are used for oral<br>
sustained release administration (Verma et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., 2000,<br>
26:695-708). In yet other embodiments, OROS™ osmotic devices are used for oral<br>
sustained release delivery devices (Theeuwes et al., United States Patent No.<br>
3,845,770; Theeuwes et al., United States Patent No. 3,916,899).<br>
In still other embodiments, a controlled-release system can be placed in<br>
proximity of the target of the compounds and/or pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
invention, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (See, e.g., Goodson, in<br>
"Medical Applications of Controlled Release," supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984).<br>
Other controlled-release systems discussed in Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533<br>
may also be used.<br>
5.7 Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions contain a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of one or more compounds of structural Formula (I), preferably in purified<br>
form, together with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, so as<br>
to provide the form for proper administration to a patient. When administered to a<br>
patient, the compounds of structural Formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
vehicles are preferably sterile. Water is a preferred vehicle when the compound of<br>
structural Formula (I) is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous<br>
dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly<br>
for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles also include excipients such<br>
as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium<br>
stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol,<br>
propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying<br><br>
agents, or pH buffering agents. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening,<br>
lubricating and coloring agents may be used.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of structural Formula<br>
(I) may be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating,<br>
dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing<br>
processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional manner<br>
using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or<br>
auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of compounds of structural Formula (I) into<br>
preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent<br>
upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of solutions,<br>
suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids,<br>
powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays,<br>
suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., Grosswald et al., United<br>
States Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles<br>
have been described in the art (see Remington: The Science and Practice of<br>
Pharmacy, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 20th Edition, 2000).<br>
For topical administration a compound of structural Formula (I) may be<br>
formulated as solutions, gels, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc. as is well-known in<br>
the art.<br>
Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection,<br>
e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection,<br>
as well as those designed for transdermal, transmucosal, oral or pulmonary<br>
administration. Systemic formulations may be made in combination with a further<br>
active agent that improves mucociliary clearance of airway mucus or reduces mucous<br>
viscosity. These active agents include, but are not limited to, sodium channel<br>
blockers, antibiotics, N-acetyl cysteine, homocysteine and phospholipids.<br>
In some embodiments, the compounds of structural Formula (I) are formulated<br>
in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for<br>
intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous<br>
buffer. For injection, a compound of structural Formula (I) may be formulated in<br>
aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks'<br><br>
solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. The solution may contain<br>
formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. When<br>
necessary, the pharmaceutical compositions may also include a solubilizing agent.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for intravenous administration may optionally include a<br>
local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally,<br>
the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form,<br>
for example, as a lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically<br>
sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active<br>
agent. When the compound of structural Formula (I) is administered by infusion, it<br>
can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile<br>
pharmaceutical grade water or saline. When the compound of structural Formula (I)<br>
is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be<br>
provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.<br>
For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be<br>
permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the<br>
art.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets,<br>
lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules,<br>
syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered pharmaceutical compositions<br>
may contain one or more optionally agents, for example, sweetening agents such as<br>
fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of<br>
wintergreen, or cherry coloring agents and preserving agents, to provide a<br>
pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in<br>
the gastrointestinal tract, thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period<br>
of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving<br>
compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds of structural Formula<br>
(I). In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is<br>
imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent<br>
composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially<br>
zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release<br>
formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol<br>
stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as<br><br>
mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose,<br>
magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
For oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and<br>
solutions, suitable carriers, excipients or diluents include water, saline,<br>
alkyleneglycols (e.g., propylene glycol), polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene<br>
glycol) oils, alcohols, slightly acidic buffers between pH 4 and pH 6 (e.g., acetate,<br>
citrate, ascorbate at between about 5.0 mM to about 50.0 mM) etc. Additionally,<br>
flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, bile salts, acylcarnitines and the like<br>
may be added.<br>
For buccal administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form<br>
of tablets, lozenges, etc. formulated in conventional manner.<br>
Liquid drug formulations suitable for use with nebulizers and liquid spray<br>
devices and EHD aerosol devices will typically include a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Preferably, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a liquid such as alcohol, water, polyethylene<br>
glycol or a perfluorocarbon. Optionally, another material may be added to alter the<br>
aerosol properties of the solution or suspension of compounds of the invention.<br>
Preferably, this material is liquid such as an alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or a fatty acid.<br>
Other methods of formulating liquid drug solutions or suspension suitable for use in<br>
aerosol devices are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Biesalski, United<br>
States Patent No. 5,112,598; Biesalski, United States Patent No. 5,556,611).<br>
A compound of structural Formula (I) may also be formulated in rectal or<br>
vaginal pharmaceutical compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g.,<br>
containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting<br>
formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, a compound of<br>
structural Formula (I) may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic<br>
materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or<br>
as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
When a compound of structural Formula (I) is acidic, it may be included in<br>
any of the above-described formulations as the free acid, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, a solvate or hydrate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts substantially<br><br><br>
retain the activity of the free acid, may be prepared by reaction with bases and tend to<br>
be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than the corresponding free acid<br>
form.<br>
5.8 Therapeutic Doses<br>
A compound of structural Formula (I), and/or pharmaceutical composition<br>
thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose.<br>
For use to treat or prevent diseases or disorders characterized by aberrant<br>
vascularization, copper metabolism disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and<br>
obesity the compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
thereof, are administered or applied in a therapeutically effective amount.<br>
The amount of a compound of structural Formula (I) that will be effective in<br>
the treatment of a particular disorder or condition disclosed herein will depend on the<br>
nature of the disorder or condition and can be determined by standard clinical<br>
techniques known in the art, as previously described. In addition, in vitro or in vivo<br>
assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The<br>
amount of a compound of structural Formula (I) administered will, of course, be<br>
dependent on, among other factors, the subject being treated, the weight of the<br>
subject, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment<br>
of the prescribing physician.<br>
For example, the dosage may be delivered in a pharmaceutical composition by<br>
a single administration, by multiple applications or controlled release. In one<br>
embodiment, the compounds of structural Formula (I) are delivered by oral sustained<br>
release administration. Preferably, in this embodiment, the compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) are administered twice per day (more preferably, once per day). Dosing<br>
may be repeated intermittently, may be provided alone or in combination with other<br>
drugs and may continue as long as required for effective treatment of the disease state<br>
or disorder.<br>
Suitable dosage ranges for oral administration depend on potency, but are<br>
generally between about 0.001 mg to about 200 mg of a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) per kilogram body weight. Dosage ranges may be readily determined by<br>
methods known to the artisan of ordinary skill the art.<br>
Suitable dosage ranges for intravenous (i.v.) administration are about 0.01 mg<br>
to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal<br><br>
administration are generally about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 1 mg/kg body<br>
weight. Suppositories generally contain about 0.01 milligram to about 50 milligrams<br>
of a compound of structural Formula (I) per kilogram body weight and comprise<br>
active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Recommended<br>
dosages for intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, epidural,<br>
sublingual or intracerebral administration are in the range of about 0.001 mg to about<br>
200 mg per kilogram of body weight. Effective doses may be extrapolated from<br>
dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Such<br>
animal models and systems are well-known in the art.<br>
The compounds of structural Formula (I) are preferably assayed in vitro and in<br>
vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For<br>
example, in vitro assays can be used to determine whether administration of a specific<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) or a combination of compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) is preferred for treating or preventing diseases or disorders characterized<br>
by aberrant vascularization, copper metabolism disorders, neurodegenerative<br>
disorders and obesity. The compounds of structural Formula (I) may also be<br>
demonstrated to be effective and safe using animal model systems.<br>
Preferably, a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) described herein will provide therapeutic benefit without causing<br>
substantial toxicity. Toxicity of compounds of structural Formula (I) may be<br>
determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures and may be readily ascertained<br>
by the skilled artisan. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the<br>
therapeutic index. A compound of structural Formula (I) will preferably exhibit<br>
particularly high therapeutic indices in treating disease and disorders. The dosage of a<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) described herein will preferably be within a range<br>
of circulating concentrations that include an effective dose with little or no toxicity.<br>
5.9 Combination Therapy<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used in combination<br>
therapy with at least one other therapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. The<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof and<br>
the other therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In<br>
some embodiments, a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical<br><br>
administration are generally about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 1 mg/kg body<br>
weight. Suppositories generally contain about 0,01 milligram to about 50 milligrams<br>
of a compound of structural Formula (I) per kilogram body weight and comprise<br>
active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Recommended<br>
dosages for intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, epidural,<br>
sublingual or intracerebral administration are in the range of about 0.001 mg to about<br>
200 mg per kilogram of body weight. Effective doses may be extrapolated from<br>
dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Such<br>
animal models and systems are well-known in the art.<br>
The compounds of structural Formula (I) are preferably assayed in vitro and in<br>
vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For<br>
example, in vitro assays can be used to determine whether administration of a specific<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) or a combination of compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) is preferred for treating or preventing diseases or disorders characterized<br>
by aberrant vascularization, copper metabolism disorders, neurodegenerative<br>
disorders and obesity. The compounds of structural Formula (I) may also be<br>
demonstrated to be effective and safe using animal model systems.<br>
Preferably, a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of structural<br>
Formula (I) described herein will provide therapeutic benefit without causing<br>
substantial toxicity. Toxicity of compounds of structural Formula (I) may be<br>
determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures and may be readily ascertained<br>
by the skilled artisan. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the<br>
therapeutic index. A compound of structural Formula (I) will preferably exhibit<br>
particularly high therapeutic indices in treating disease and disorders. The dosage of a<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) described herein will preferably be within a range<br>
of circulating concentrations that include an effective dose with little or no toxicity.<br>
5.9 Combination Therapy<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of structural<br>
Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used in combination<br>
therapy with at least one other therapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. The<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof and<br>
the other therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In<br>
some embodiments, a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition thereof is administered concurrently with the administration of another<br>
therapeutic agent, which may be part of the same pharmaceutical composition as the<br>
compound of structural Formula (I) or a different pharmaceutical composition. In<br>
other embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of structural Formula (I) is<br>
administered prior or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent.<br>
In some embodiments, the compounds of structural Formula (I) and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with other<br>

pharmaceutical compositions thereof are also provided herein. The therapeutic kits<br>
may also contain other compounds (e.g., chemotherapeutic agents, natural products,<br>
hormones or antagonists, anti-angiogenesis agents or inhibitors, apoptosis-inducing<br>
agents or chelators) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof.<br><br>
Therapeutic kits may have a single container which contains the compound of<br>
structural Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof with or without<br>
other components (e.g., other compounds and/or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
thereof) or may have distinct container for each component. Preferably, therapeutic<br>
kits include a compound of structural Formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof packaged for use in combination with the co-administration of a<br>
second compound (preferably, a chemotherapeutic agent, a natural product, a<br>
hormone or antagonist, a anti-angiogenesis agent or inhibitor, an apoptosis-inducing<br>
agent or a chelator) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. The components of the<br>
kit may be pre-complexed or each component may be in a separate distinct container<br>
prior to administration to a patient.<br>
The components of the kit may be provided in one or more liquid solutions,<br>
preferably, an aqueous solution, more preferably, a sterile aqueous solution. The<br>
components of the kit may also be provided as solids, which may be converted into<br>
liquids by addition of suitable solvents, which are preferably provided in another<br>
distinct container.<br>
The container of a therapeutic kit may be a vial, test tube, flask, bottle,<br>
syringe, or any other means of enclosing a solid or liquid. Usually, when there is<br>
more than one component, the kit will contain a second vial or other container, which<br>
allows for separate dosing. The kit may also contain another container for a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable liquid.<br>
Preferably, a therapeutic kit will contain apparatus (e.g., one or more needles,<br>
syringes, eye droppers, pipette, etc.), which enables administration of the components<br>
of the kit.<br>
6. Examples<br>
The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples, which<br>
describe in detail, preparation of compounds of the invention and methods for<br>
assaying for biological activity. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
many modifications, both to materials and methods, may be practiced without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br>
6.1 Example 1: General Procedure for Synthesis of Tetrathiotungstate<br>
Derivatives<br>
The quaternary ammonium hydroxide (2 eq.), as a commercially-available<br>
aqueous solution, was added to ammonium tetrathiotungstate (1 eq.) and deionized<br>
water was added until all the solid material was dissolved. The solution was placed<br>
on a rotary evaporator under vacuum (ca. 5-10 torr) with the bath at 20 °C for one<br>
hour and the water was replaced as needed to maintain a constant volume. The<br>
reaction mixture was then allowed to evaporate to dryness and the resulting yellow<br>
solid was recrystallized from deionized water and isopropanol. The solid was<br>
collected by filtration, washed with isopropanol and diethyl ether, and then dried<br>
under high vacuum for 24 hours in a vacuum desiccator in the presence of P2O5.<br>
6.2	Example 2: General Procedure for Synthesis of Tetrathiotungstate<br>
Derivatives<br>
The quaternary ammonium halide (2 eq.) as a solid was added to a suspension<br>
of ammonium tetrathiotungstate (1 eq.) in dry acetonitrile (5 mL per mmol of<br>
tetrathiotungstate) and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature under<br>
nitrogen for 18 hours. If this procedure resulted in a precipitate, the solid was<br>
collected by filtration, washed with isopropanol and diethyl ether and was<br>
recrystallized from deionized water and isopropanol. The yellow crystals were<br>
collected by filtration, washed with isopropanol and diethyl ether and dried under<br>
high vacuum for 24 hours in a vacuum desiccator in the presence of P2O5. If the<br>
solution remained clear, the solvent was removed in vacuo, the residue was taken up<br>
in dichloromethane, washed three times with water, once with brine, dried (Na2S04),<br>
and the solution was concentrated. The resulting oil or solid was dried under high<br>
vacuum for 24 hours in a vacuum desiccator in the presence of P2O5.<br>
6.3	Example 3: General Procedure for Synthesis of Tetrathiotungstate<br>
Derivatives<br>
The quaternary ammonium halide (2 eq.) as a solution in deionized water (10<br>
mL per mmol of tetrathiotungstate) was added to a suspension of ammonium<br>
tetrathiotungstate (1 eq.) in dry acetonitrile (20 mL per mmol of tetrathiotungstate)<br>
and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. If this<br><br>
procedure resulted in a precipitate, the solid was collected by filtration, washed with<br>
water, isopropanol and diethyl ether, and then dried under high vacuum for 24 hours<br>
in a vacuum desiccator in the presence of P2O5. If the solution remained clear, the<br>
reaction mixture was first filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The<br>
resulting solid was recrystallized from deionized water and isopropanol, the yellow<br>
crystals collected by filtration, washed with isopropanol and diethyl ether and then<br>
dried under high vacuum for 24 hours in a vacuum desiccator in the presence of P2O5.<br>

6.24	Example 24: Moisture Stability of Tetrathiotungstate Salts<br>
Salts of tetrathiotungstate were placed in an acrylic chamber at room<br>
temperature with 95% relative humidity for two weeks. The samples were analyzed<br>
for purity according to the previously reported method with the exception that the<br>
absorbance was monitored at 493nm and the molar absorptivity was 15710 M1cm-1<br>
(McDonald et. al, Inorg. Chitn. Acta 1983, 72, 205-210). The results are reported<br>
below in Table 1<br><br><br><br>
6.25 Example 25: Copper-binding Ability of Tetrathiotungstate salts<br>
The copper-binding ability of tetrathiotungstate salts was determined<br>
according to the ability of tetrathiotungstate salts to inhibit cysteine autooxidation aS<br>
reported in Table 2 below.<br>
Table 2<br>
Inhibition of Cysteine Autooxidation (1OOM Cys, 1OOM Coumarin-3-carboxylic<br>
acid, 1OOM CuSO4)	<br><br><br><br><br><br>
6.25 Example 25: Inhibition of Angiogenesis in Matrigel® Plug Assay by<br>
Ammonium Tetrathiotungstate<br>
Ammonium tetrathiotungstate was assayed in the matrigel® plug assay as<br>
described in Section 5.4.7, supra. Two positive controls were used with positive<br>
control 1 measured five days after implantation when treatment began and negative<br>
control 2 measured five days after implantation when treatment ended. Two negative<br>
controls were used with negative control 1 measured five days after implantation<br>
when treatment began and negative control 2 measured five days after implantation<br>
when treatment ended. As can be seen in.Figure 1, treatment with ammonium<br>
tetrathiotungstate resulted in about 34% inhibition using this assay.<br>
