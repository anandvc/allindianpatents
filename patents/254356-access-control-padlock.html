PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
ACCESS CONTROL PADLOCK<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a padlock more particularly the invention relates to a padlock. Controllable by the owner or master as and when he requires it. The padlock is having two key holes at the bottom to operate two independent cylinders with there respective corns to lock a unlock the shuckle one is master key and another is individual key. The individual keys can be provided to many operators for day to day locking and unlocking where the key rotates the cam by 90o therefore key can not be taken out without locking. The master key on the other hand can operate both the cylinders and therefore locking and unlocking is being controlling by a single person or the owner of the firm he can give access to many operators by providing individual keys to the operators by allowing master key cylinder in open condition by a rotating 360o and thereby allowing the key to take out.<br>
In other words the owner of madter key can disallow the access to his operators when he is absent by rotating the master key 360o and the cam locks the shackle wherein the shackle will not come out even if the individual key operates the other cylinder thereby denying the access to operator or individual key.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A padlock is known in Indian patent and is basically single key or dual key operated. Such locks have in the past been sold with lock cylinders operable by single key and / or two keys are required simultaneously to open and close the padlock. This type of padlocks do not have override or access control feature in it, so that one key will have control on other key i.e. one key will allow or disallow opening of the padlock by other key thereby having control on it. The term access control will be understood to mean that if a person (master) suspects the other person (slave or operator) which is regularly operating the padlock with his key or key is lost and it is suspected that it has been acquired by an unauthorised person, it is possible to stop the access by the said key (i.e. lost key or slave key).<br>
Often in normal padlocks, nothing can be done to avoid the misuse of lost key and / or we cannot stop / restrict the access of an unwanted person.<br>
Usually these locks are required to be replaced by new ones which becomes expensive than the said innovative access control padlock.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principle object underlying the present invention is to provide access control feature / facility in a padlock and indeed to ensure that the lock cannot be opened without someone's consent to ensure that the lock is secured against tampering by an unauthorized person.<br>
fnorder to satisfy the above object there are provided two different key cylinders operable by separate keys which further includes cams biased into position of cylinder core, which are adapted to be engaged with complementary recesses on shackle, in locked position. Because the cams are engaged independently with the shackle member they control the opening of shackle independently by the different key cylinders. When the first key cylinder is operated and the second cam is in unlocked condition, the lock behaves as a single key lock i.e. as a normal padlock available in the market. Whereas, when the second cam is rotated into locked position of the other shackle limb end, it overrides the access of the first key i.e. if at all first key cylinder is operated and the cam be rotated to unlocked position, shackle will not come out of the housing as it is held in locked position by the second cam. This means that the access of the first key is controlled by second key thereby providing a access control facility in the padlock.<br>
The above and other features of the invention, and advantages deriving there from, will appear evident from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments made with reference to the attached drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Turning now to figure 1 to 10, there can be seen a padlock having a lock housing (1) which is oval shaped and having the open ended chambers (lc &amp; Id) along the cross section to receive key cylinders (3 &amp; 4) and guide bore (la) and cutout (lb) to receive the 'U' Shaped shackle, key cylinders (these are the standard locking cylinders manufactured by M/s. Godrej &amp; Boyce Mfg Co. Ltd, Mumbai, but any other key cylinder with required modifications can be used). The lock can be opened by inserting a key (5) into the key cylinder (4) and turning key 90° in clockwise direction thereby rotating the cam (7) by 90° and aligning the surface (7a) of the cam (7) in orientation with the surfaces (2a) of the shackle (2) thereby allowing the shackle to move out of the cam (7). The groove (2c) and (2d) are provided on the shackle (2) which are adapted to be engaged with the cam surface (7c) when the cam surfaces (7a) is oriented 90° to the shackle surfaces (2a &amp; 2b) respectively. Cams (7 &amp; 8) are rotatably engaged with key cylinder plugs (9 &amp; 10), a recess (7d) is formed on the cam periphery to accommodate a pin (20) rigidly fixed into the cylinder housing (11). This restricts the rotation of a cam 90° clockwise and anti-clockwise. A cam (7) is also provided with a rib (7b) at bottom adapted to be engaged with a recesses (9a &amp; 10a) of locking cylinder (9 &amp; 10). A retaining cap (14) is provided to rotatably retain the shackle (2) with the housing (1) wherein provided a axial bore (14a) to reciprocatively guide the shackle and a bore (14b) to rotateably retain the retainer pin (13), secured to the shackle (2) by the screw means (18) fixed into the threaded recess (2e) of the shackle (2). The said retainer cap is retained with the housing by screw means (19) passing through the bores (le) of the housing (1). A screw means (17) adapted to be engaged with the recess (11a) and inserted through bore (If) is provided to secure the key cylinder (4) with the housing (1). A spring baised plug (15) adapted to be engaged with recess (12e) of the key cylinder housing (12) is provided to secure the another key cylinder (3) with the lock housing (1). A spring (16) housed into the bore (If) is provided to retain a pin (15) in the recess (12e). A recess (10a) is provided on a locking cylinder plug (09) which is adapted to be engaged with a rib (7b) of a cam (7). A key (6) is inserted into locking cylinder (3) and the plug (10) is rotated through 360° thereby rotating a cam (8) through 90° as the projection (10a) has got 270° free rotation before engaging with a rib in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Refering to Figure 6a, a key cylinder comprise of plug (9) having bores (9c) to accommodate operating pins (22), a slot (9a) and a groove (9b) to engage with the wedge (21) a housing (11) having corresponding bores (lid) to plug (9) for accommodating driver pins (23) and springs (24), a pin (20) integrally fitted with cylinder housing (11) through a bore (lib), a sleeve (25)<br>
4<br><br>
having slot (25a) to hold the springs in place and a wedge (21) inserted through a slot (lie) extending into groove (9b) for retaining plug and housing in place.<br>
When a key (5) is inserted into key cylinder the pins are aligned along the shear line thereby making cylinder plug free to rotate with respective to cylinder housing wherein in turn it rotates the cam (7), when key is retracted driver pins enter into cylinder plug bores and lock the cylinder plug with respect to cylinder housing.<br>
