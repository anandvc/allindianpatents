HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   1    -<br>
LOW AMOUNTS OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLYMERS FOR ENHANCING VISCOSITY OF AQUEOUS/AQUEOUS BIPHASIC LIQUIDS<br>
The present invention relates to aqueous liquid compositions   that are biphasic in nature.  In particular, it relates to the use of high molecular weight polymers in such compositions to enhance the viscosity of the compositions when in a single phase, and without destroying the ability to induce good phase separation in such compositions.<br><br>
Biphasic liquids defined by the general fact that the liquid is divided into two phases are not new.  In some of these liquids, one layer is an aqueous layer and the second layer is a water inmmiscible oily material, while in others both<br>
     layers are aqueous based.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,718,609 issued to Weimer on February 27, 1973 discloses a liquid detergent composition having an aqueous layer and a layer of liquid water immiscible oily   material.  When shaken, the liquid forms a temporary oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,810,478, issued to Olson Jr. et al. on May 14, 1974, discloses a two-phase shampoo composition made by preparing substantially polar and lipophilic portions of a shampoo composition.<br>
Biphasic compositions comprising an upper and lower aqueous phase are also disclosed in the art.  U.S. Patent No.   6,429,177 issued to Williams et al. on August 6, 2002 discloses biphasic compositions including 5 % to 35 %<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
surfactant; 1 % to 12 % thickener; 4 % to 20 % polyalkylene glycol; and a sufficient amount of non-chelating mineral salt to induce phase separation.<br>
   U.S. Patent No. 6,180,587 issued to Fuller et al. on January 30, 2001 disclose multiphase cleansing compositions having at least 1 % of a polymer or copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyacryalate, polystyrene sulfonate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, maleic anhydride and their mixtures.<br><br>
EP 0,116,422 to Harmer published on April 6, 1988 also discloses multi-layered compositions in which two liquids are dispersible and which separate on standing.  Sodium hexamataphosphate is a preferred biphasic inducing agent<br>
     required in these compositions.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 6,787,511 issued to Patel et al. on September 7, 2004, and U.S. Patent No. 6,727,209 issued to Pereira et al. on April 27, 2 004, the current inventors   reported that polydextrose of molecular weight between about 600 and about 3,000 Daltons, used alone or in combination<br>
with a salt such as MgSO4 and/or sucrose, induced biphasic<br>
liquid formation.  While these compositions are adequate, they do not have a particularly high viscosity, particularly<br>
     the type of viscosity suitable for liquid cleansers targeted to personal cleansing (e.g. shower gels and shampoos).  One of the goals of the subject invention was to provide small amounts (e.g. under 1 % by wt.) of high molecular weight polymers which could raise the viscosity to levels more<br>
     suitable for such shower gels and/or shampoos.<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   3    -<br>
In a co-pending application filed on December 28, 2004 to Patel et al., the applicants disclose specific biphasic inducing agents (BIAs) that can be used alone or in combination with polydextrose and/or salt.  Two classes of  the new BIA are specific polysaccharides that surprisingly have much higher molecular weights than the optimal polydextrose oligomers described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,787,511 and 6,727,209 noted above; and intermediate ethoxylates of fatty esters or fatty acids.  These BIAs can   be used alone and are used for purpose of economy or to provide opacity.<br>
The high MW polymers of the subject invention, by contrast, are always used as adjunct materials (i.e., less than 1 % by<br>
    wt.) and are specifically used to enhance viscosity of previously known biphasic compositions (for example as taught in U.S. Patent No. 6,787,511 or U.S Patent No. 6,727,209).  Moreover, they enhance viscosity while retaining the ability to induce phase separation in the<br>
    compositions.<br>
As noted, the present invention relates to use of low amounts of high molecular weight polymers (e.g. thickeners of at least certain MW, wherein some classes of viscosity   building polymers are particularly preferred) to further enhance the viscosity of aqueous/aqueous biphasic liquids after they have been stirred/agitated and are in one phase. The amounts cannot be too high without destroying ability to adequately phase separate.<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>

Unexpectedly, the applicants have now found novel biphasic compositions comprising small amounts (e.g. 0.01 % to 1 % by wt.) of high MW viscosity building polymers, and processes for enhancing the viscosity of biphasic liquids   (particularly those induced by polydextrose) using low amounts of such high molecular weight polymers.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention comprises:<br>
        (a) 5 % to 70 %, preferably 5 % to 50 % by wt. of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof;<br>
        (b) 1 % to 12 % by wt. thickener;<br>
(c)	4 % to 20 % by wt. polyalkylene glycol;<br>
(d)	a non-chelating mineral salt selected from alkali metal or alkaline earth sulfates, bisulfates, carbonates, bicarbonates, and mixtures thereof,<br>
	wherein the non-chelating mineral salt is present in<br>
an amount sufficient to induce a separation of the aqueous composition into at least two distinct aqueous layers that are present in a volume ratio of upper to lower phase of from 4:1 to l:4;<br>
	wherein on standing the personal product composition<br>
forms two or more visibly distinct aqueous phases and, when agitated, the composition forms a visible single phase product, wherein, when left to stand after the composition<br>
	has been agitated and has formed a single phase, the<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   5<br>
composition will again form two or more visibly<br>
distinct aqueous phases within 24 hours; and<br>
      (e) 0.01 % to less than 1 % by wt. of viscosity building<br>
          polymer and/or copolymer having molecular weight of<br>
	           at least 5,000, preferably at least 10,000, more<br>
preferably at least 25,000 (no upper limit although,<br>
as a practical matter, limit is 500,000 preferably<br>
300,000, more preferably 200,000),<br>
wherein said polymer enhances viscosity (of the<br>
single phase solution, after agitation) at least 5<br>
%, preferably at least 10 %, preferably at least 20 %, more preferably at least 30 % relative to same composition without polymer.<br>
    As a practical matter, there is a balance between molecular wt. and how much polymer is added.  As the molecular weight of polymer increases, less amount is needed.  While not wishing to be bound by theory, this is believed to be due to requirement to maintain phase separation.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises<br>
(a)	5 % to 70 %, preferably 5 % to 50 % of a surfactant<br>
selected from the group consisting of anionic<br>
	surfactants, nonionic surfactants,<br>
amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof;<br>
(b)	at least about 15 % of a polydextrose molecule or<br>
molecules, wherein the degree of polymerization is<br>
	about 4 to 22 (corresponding to MW about 600 to<br>
about 3 600);<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   6<br>
      (c) balance water and minors,<br>
wherein said composition comprises at least two visibly separated aqueous based layers when left sitting without shaking or stirring; and       <br>
      (d) 0.01 % to less than 1 % by wt. of viscosity building polymer and/or copolymer having molecular weight of at least 5,000, preferably at least 10,000, more preferably at least 25,000,<br>
wherein said polymer enhances viscosity at least<br>
	about 2 0 %, preferably at least 30 % relative to<br>
same composition without polymer.<br>
The same practical limitations to the upper molecular weight and regarding the balance of molecular wt. to the amounts   used apply as noted above for first embodiment.<br>
In a third embodiment of the invention, the invention comprises a method of enhancing viscosity of aqueous/aqueous biphasic liquids when they are in a single phase after agitation, which method comprises using, in the process for preparing said compositions, 0.01 % to less than 1 % of a polymer and/or copolymer having a MW of at least 5,000, preferably at least 10,000, preferably at least 25,000.  The polymers which may be used are discussed in more detail below.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the<br>
    appended claims.  For the avoidance of doubt, any feature of<br>
one aspect of the present invention may be utilized in any<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
other aspect of the invention.  It is noted that the examples given in the description below are intended to clarify the invention and are not intended to limit the invention to those examples per se. <br>
Other than in the experimental examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about".  Similarly,<br>
    all percentages are weight/weight percentages of the total composition unless otherwise indicated.  Numerical ranges expressed in the format "from x to y" are understood to include x and y.  When for a specific feature multiple preferred ranges are described in the format "from x to y" ,<br>
    it is understood that all ranges combining the different endpoints are also contemplated.<br>
Where the term "comprising" is used in the specification or claims, it is not intended to exclude any terms, steps or<br>
    features not specifically recited.  All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless specified otherwise.  All measurements are in SI units unless specified otherwise. All documents cited are - in relevant part - incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The subject invention relates to the use of low amounts of high molecular weight polymers to unexpectedly enhance viscosity of aqueous/aqueous biphasic liquids (especially those induced using polydextrose).  The invention further<br>
    relates to biphasic compositions comprising low amounts of<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
such polymers.  Use of amounts too high may affect ability of compositions to phase separate after agitation.<br>
Specifically, these high molecular weight polymers are used    to enhance viscosity of typical aqueous/aqueous biphasic<br>
liquids known in the art in order to obtain viscosity levels more suitable for, for example, shampoos, body liquids etc. for which the compositions are often intended.<br>
     In this regard, in one embodiment the invention relates to aqueous/aqueous biphasic liquid compositions formed using polyalkylene glycol and defined salts as biphasic inducing agent (such compositions typically include some thickeners). Typically, such compositions are described in U.S. Patent<br>
    No. 6,429,177 to Williams et al., for example.  In this embodiment, the high molecular weight copolymers of the invention are also present and serve to enhance viscosity relative to the same composition without the high molecular weight polymer (e.g. to enhance viscosity at least 5 %,<br>
     preferably at least 10 %, more preferably at least 20 %, more preferably 20 % to 100 % or more relative to same composition without polymer).<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, the invention relates to   aqueous/aqueous biphasic liquid compositions formed using defined polydextran molecule or molecules as biphasic inducing agent.  Typical such compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,787,511 to Patel et al. Again, the high MW polymer of the invention serves to    remarkably enhance viscosity relative to same compositions<br>
without the polymer (e.g. 5 % to 100 % or more preferably at<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
least 10 %, more preferably at least 20 %, more preferably at least 3 0 % relative to same composition without polymer).<br>
In a third embodiment, the invention relates to a process  for enhancing viscosity of aqueous/aqueous biphasic liquid compositions at least 5 %, preferably at least 10 %, more preferably at least 20 % to 100 % by ensuring that the compositions, when formed, incorporate the defined high molecular weight polymers of the invention.<br><br>
As noted, in one embodiment, the invention relates to aqueous/aqueous biphasic compositions formed using polyalkylene glycol and defined salts as biphasic inducing agent.<br><br>
Typically, such compositions are, prior to mixing, found in two phases (upper and lower aqueous phases) comprising:<br>
(1) an upper aqueous layer comprising:<br>
 	(a) 5 % to 35 % by wt. of total composition (10 % to<br>
about 75 % by wt. upper aqueous phase in part depending on ratio of upper layer to lower layer) of a lathering surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants,<br>
  	nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic<br>
surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof (preferably at least one anionic should be present) ,-(b) 4 % to 25 % by wt. of total composition,<br>
 	preferably 7 % to 20 % by wt. of a polyalkylene<br>
glycol selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
alcohols or polyethers having MW 2 00 to about 6000;<br>
(c)	1 % to 12 % by wt. of the total composition,<br>
preferably 2 % to 10 % by wt. of a<br>
 	thickener/viscosity modifier (found<br>
substantially totally in the upper layer) to<br>
improve the separation of particles and layers<br>
on standing; examples of such thickeners include<br>
hydrophobically modified polyethylene glycols,<br>
 	such as PEG (160) sorbitan triisostearate (ex.<br>
Kao) or polyol alkoxy ester and laureth 3 (ex Croda);<br>
(d)	less than about 30 %, preferably less than 25 %<br>
of the total non-chelating electrolyte present<br>
 	in the composition (most is in lower layer) such<br>
as, for example, salts of sulphate, bisulphate or a carbonate etc. (e.g. magnesium sulphate); and<br>
       (2) a lower aqueous layer comprising:<br>
(a)	less than 10 %, preferably less than 5 % of the<br>
total surfactant present in the composition of<br>
lathering surfactant (greater than 90 % and<br>
preferably substantially all being found in the<br>
 	upper aqueous layer) as defined in (1)(a) above<br>
(b)	less than 25 %, preferably less than 20 % of<br>
total polyalkylene glycol present in the<br>
composition (75 % or greater of total<br>
polyalkylene glycol being found in upper layer)<br>
 	as in (1) (b) above;<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
       11<br>
c) less than 15 %, preferably less than 10 % of<br>
total thickener present in the composition<br>
(greater than 85 % and preferably substantially<br>
all being found in upper layer) as defined in<br>
	(1)(c) above; and<br>
(d) greater than 75 %, preferably greater than 85 % of the non chelating electrolyte present in the composition as defined in (1)(d) above;<br>
    In an unmixed state, the compositions of the invention will separate into two (or more) stable layers.  The upper aqueous layer will comprise (a) surfactant; (b) polyalkylene glycol, and/or polyether to improve mildness and separation; (c) thickener to improve separation at standing; (d)<br>
    electrolyte (non-chelating); and (e) water.  The lower layer will have approximately the same ingredients, but the distribution (i.e., % of total component in upper or lower layer) will be different.  It is important to emphasize that at least two of the distinct phases are aqueous solutions<br>
   and that the composition can be prepared without any oil if desired.<br>
More particularly, the upper layer and the lower layer may be anywhere, respectively, from about an 80:20 ratio to    about a 20:80 ratio, preferably 70:30 to 30:70, more<br>
preferably 60:40 to 40:60.  It should be noted that ratios are not exact and are dependent on composition.<br>
Further, the breakdown of components into upper and lower   layers can be approximated as follows:<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   12   -<br><br>
	Upper Layer	Lower Layer<br>
Surfactant	80 % or greater, preferably substantially all	20 % or lower, preferably substantially absent<br>
Polyalkylene Glycol	65 % or greater, preferably 70 % or greater	35 % or lower, preferably 30 % or lower<br>
Thickener	80 % or higher, preferably 85 % or higher	20 % or lower, preferably 15 % or lower, preferably substantially absent<br>
Electrolyte	Less than 25 %, preferably less than 20 %	Greater than 75%, preferably greater than 80%<br>
The high molecular weight polymers of the invention typically will be found in the upper surfactant rich layer   and, as noted, will comprise about 0.1 % to less than 1 % by wt. of the composition.  While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that most of the polymer phase separates in the upper layer.  This is believed true because measurements have shown viscosity of lower layer to remain   low.  Upon mixing, however, the polymers do raise viscosity of the final, mixed composition.<br>
The components are described in more detail below.<br>
    The surfactant generally will comprise 5 % to 35 % by wt. of the total composition or 10 % to 75 % by wt. of the upper aqueous layer.  Although it is preferred that greater than 90 %, preferably greater than 95 % and more preferably substantially all surfactant be present in the upper aqueous<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
layer, as noted, some small amount (less than 20 %) may be found in the lower aqueous layer.<br>
The surfactant is a surfactant which may be selected from  the group consisting of anionic surfactants, nonionic<br>
surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, there will be at least one anionic surfactant.<br>
    Non-limiting examples of anionic surfactants are disclosed in McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers, North American Edition (1986), published by Allured Publishing Corporation; McCutcheon's Functional materials, North Americas Edition (1992), both of which are incorporated by reference into the<br>
    subject application.<br>
Examples of anionic surfactants include sarcosinates, sulfates, isethionates, taurates, phosphates, lactylates, glutamates and mixtures thereof.  Among isethionates are<br>
    preferred alkoyl isethionates such as sodium cocoyl<br>
isethionate, sodium lauroyl isethionate and mixtures.<br>
The alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates typically have the<br>
respective formulae ROSO3M and RO(C2H4O)XSO3M, wherein R is<br>
     alkyl or alkenyl of from about 10 to about 3 0 carbon atoms, x is from about 1 to about 10, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and triethanolamine.  Another suitable class of anionic surfactants are the water-soluble salts of the organic,<br>
 	   sulfuric acid reaction products of the general formula:<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   14   -R3.-SO3-M<br>
wherein R1 is chosen form the group consisting of a straight<br>
or branched chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon of   radical having from about 8 to about 24, preferably about 10 to about 16, carbon atoms; and M is a cation.  Still other anionic synthetic surfactants include the class designated as succinamates, olefin sulfonates having about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms, and a-alkyloxy alkane sulfonates.

Aqueous solubility of the salt should exceed 30 % wt. to volume at 0°C such that it may be observed that mineral salts will generally be more preferred than organic salts, which typically have much lower solubility.<br>
The high molecular weight polymers of the invention are  typically polymers which have molecular weight of at least 5,000, preferably at least 10,000, more preferably at least 25,000.<br>
Theoretically, any viscosity enhancing polymer may be used,<br>
    although the polymer(s) chosen must have the ability to both enhance viscosity and ensure that biphasic composition is stably induced.  Thus, some classes of viscosity enhancing polymers may be better than others at maximizing viscosity increase.<br><br>
Among preferred classes of viscosity enhancing copolymer or polymers which will not interfere with successful biphasic inducing, for example, are (1) non-starch polysaccharides such as cellulose polymers and derivatives of such including,<br>
    for example, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydrophobically modified HEC (HMHEC), methyl hydroxyethyl or methyl hydroxypropyl cellulose (MHEC or MHPC), ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC) and mixtures of the above;<br>
   (2) high molecular weight, starch based polysaccharides,<br>
especially water soluble (e.g. dissolve at least 10 % by wt.<br><br>

in water) polysaccharides; (3) polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers of MW 5,000 to 300,000, preferably 10,000 to 150,000; (4) polyvinyl  alcohol polymers; (5) vinyl acetate polymers; and (6) copolymers of the above (e.g. polyvinylpyrollidone -vinyl acetate copolymers), and/or mixtures of the above.<br>
As noted, non-starch polysaccharides may include any of the cellulose polymers, for example, indicated above.<br>
   High molecular weight, starch-based polymers are also useful for enhancing viscosity.<br>
Especially preferred are water soluble, preferably highly water soluble (e.g. dissolve at level of at least about 10 %  by weight in water) polysaccharides.  Preferably these form stable solutions at ambient temperature, and preferably the polysaccharides also form clear isotropic solutions in water at room temperature.<br>
   Without wishing to be bound by theory, suitable starch based polysaccharides tend to be nonionic in character, and tend to have a molecular structure that inhibits molecular association especially in water, e.g. branching, kinks or small pendant groups appearing with sufficiently high<br>
   frequency, i.e., short repeat lengths.<br>
Many such polysaccharides are described in the treatise edited by R. L. Whistler and J. N. BeMiller, "Industrial Gums: Polysaccharides and Their Derivatives", 3rd Edition, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, California (1993), herein<br><br>

One suitable class of polymers is pullulan which is   described in Whistler, Chapter 16, p. 447.  Pullulan is a class of glucans elaborated extra cellularly by the fungus Aureobasidium (also known as Pullularia).  Pullulan dissolves readily in water to form stable viscous solutions that do not gel. <br>
The structure of Pullulan is reported to be predominantly based maltotriose units jointed by alpha (1-6) linkages.<br>
Depending upon the strain of fungus employed, the molecular   weight of pullulan can vary between 1,000 to 3,000,000 daltons.  However, for the purposes of the present application, the molecular weight should be greater than about 10,000, preferably greater than 50,000 and most preferably between 100,000 and 300,000 daltons.  Pullulan is   available from Hayashibara and sold under the trade name Pullulan PI-20.  A particular pullulan from Hayashibara having an average molecular weight of 200,000 was suitable.<br>
Another class of viscosity enhancing molecules which may be   used are those with a ring structure, preferably a 5 or 6 member ring structure, wherein the ring structure is chemically bonded to a polymerizable vinyl group to form a vinyl polymer (e.g. with pendant ring structure).

One preferred class are polyvinylpyrrolidones of varying   molecular weight, e.g. 5000 to 250,000.<br>
Another class of molecules are the polyvinyl alcohol polymers wherein, for example, OH is chemically bonded to polymerizable vinyl group to form polyvinyl alcohol polymer. Again, molecular weight of polymer is typically from about 5000 to 250,000.<br>
Yet another class of suitable molecule are molecules in<br>
which C1-C6 carboxylic acid group (e.g. acetic acid) is<br>
  chemically to polymerizable vinyl group to form polymer (e.g. vinyl acetate).<br>
The viscosity enhancing polymer may comprise a copolymer which may be a copolymer of any of the groups described   above which are, for example, block polymerized.  One example of this are polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer such as shown below, for example:<br><br><br>

The polymer may also be a mixture of any of the molecules (polymer and/or copolymers) noted above.<br><br>

Whether defined by glucose units or MW, it should be understood that the critical point is that the structure is such as to induce formation of a multiphasic/biphasic<br>
formulation defined by those characteristics which in turn define the biphasic liquid (e.g. viscosity of and stability in the biphasic state).<br>
    The amount of polydextrose used to induce biphasic state may vary depending on whether salt/electrolyte is used.<br><br><br><br>
Thus, for example, if no salt is used (use of no or little salt also distinguishes this invention from other biphasic liquids of the art where relatively large amounts of salt, e.g. greater than 3 % by wt., are in fact required to induce<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/003451<br><br>
-   34   -<br>
the biphasic liquid), then there is needed at least 15 % by wt. of polydextrose to induce biphasic separation.  If some salt is added (e.g. at least 0.5 %, preferably at least 1.0 %), the amount of polydextrose needed goes down to 10 % by wt.  If at least 2 % salt is used, the amount of polydextrose may be 5 %.<br>
There is also generally a balance between the amount of surfactant used and the amount of polydextrose.  Generally<br>
   lower surfactant requires more polydextrose and, conversely, more surfactant requires less polydextrose.  Thus, for example, 5 % to 10 % by wt. surfactant may require about 4 0 % or more polydextrose and 3 5 % surfactant may need only about 10 % to 15 % polydextrose, even in the absence of<br>
     salt.<br>
Generally, the upper limit of polydextrose used is about 75 %.  This is not an upper limit with regard to inducing biphasic liquid. <br>
If electrolyte/salt is used, it typically will be used in amount of 0.5 % to no higher than 4 %, preferably no higher than about 3 % by wt. of total composition.<br>
    Preferably, the electrolyte is not a chelating electrolyte (these are generally poor in biodegradability).<br>
Typically, the electrolyte should be a salt of a sulphate, bisulfate, carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate, chloride, etc.   Examples include sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate,<br>
ammonium sulphate, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride.<br><br>
WO 2006/108673<br><br>

-   35   -<br>
Magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride are particularly preferred.<br>
The high molecular weight polymers may be any of those  described in connection with the first embodiment biphasic liquid above (e.g. non-starch polysaccharides, high molecular weight starch based polysaccharides, etc.)<br>
Finally, the balance of composition is water and minors. <br>

In the case of biphasic liquids induced by polyalkylene glycol and salt, the composition is prepared in batch  process as follows:<br>
Polyalkylene glycol (e.g. polyethylene glycol) and surfactant (sodium lauryl ether (2E0) sulphate) are premixed.  Water is slowly added with continuous mixing,<br>
   while heating to about 70°C.  High molecular weight polymer is added.  Thickener (e.g. polyethylene glycol (50) sorbitan triisostearate) is added and mixed to homogeneous. Electrolyte (e.g. magnesium sulphate heptahydrate) is added. The mixture is allowed to cool to about 4 0°C before adding<br>
    perfume and other ingredients.  Constant mixing is used to prevent premature phase separation before filling.  A typical composition as noted below is made.<br><br><br>
