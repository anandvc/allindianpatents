In a first reaction step, diamino compounds of formula V, in which R2 and R3 have the meanings indicated above, are converted into 3H-imidazo[4,5-bjpyridine derivatives in a manner known from the literature or with analogous or similar use of processes known from the literature.

Said reaction can be carried out in a manner as described in the following examples or as known to the person skilled in the art according to a Wittig reaction.

In the step following the Wittig reaction, the compound(s) obtained are converted into the corresponding free amino compound(s) by removal of the abovementioned protective group PG1 in a manner customary per se. For example, when PG1 is trityl, detritylation can be obtained, for example, with the aid of aqueous acetic acid according to the procedure specified in the following examples, or, when PG1 is acetyl, desacetylation can be obtained, for example, in aqueous sulphuric acid at elevated temperature, such as e.g. in 10% strength aqueous sulphuric acid at boiling temperature. The reduction of the abovementioned exocyclic double bond following the deprotection reaction leads to desired compounds of formula I, in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings given above. This reaction can be carried out as hydrogenation reaction according to procedures known to the person skilled in the art or according to the following examples in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as, for example, palladium on active carbon or platinum dioxide, in a suitable solvent (e.g. in a lower alcohol, such as, for example, methanol).

More specifically, such as for example, from compounds of formula I, in which R2 or R3 is bromine or iodine, the corresponding arylated compounds can be obtained by abovementioned Suzuki reaction; or from compounds of formula I, in which R21 is benzyloxy, the corresponding free hydroxyl compound can be obtained by debenzylation reaction; or from compounds of formula I, in which R2 is phenyl, the corresponding compounds, in which R2 is phenyl substituted by -S02-Het, can be obtained via two steps by chlorosulfonylation and then reaction with the corresponding heterocyclic amine Het-H. Optionally, compounds of formula I can be converted into their salts, or, optionally, salts of the compounds of formula I can be converted into the free compounds. Corresponding processes are known to the person skilled in the art. The compounds of formula I can be converted, optionally, into their N-oxides, for example with the aid of hydrogen peroxide in methanol or with the aid of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane. The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with the reaction conditions which are specifically necessary for<br><br>
carrying out the N-oxidation. It is known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in T. Greene and P. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999, 3rd Ed.) or in P. Kocienski, "Protecting Groups (Thieme Foundations Organic Chemistry Series N Group" (Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000). The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatography on a suitable support material. Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone like acetone, methylethylketone, or methylisobutylketone, an ether, like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which the desired acid is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a non-solvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by basification into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner, pharmacologically non-tolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts. Suitably, the conversions mentioned in this invention can be carried out analogously or similarly to methods which are familiar per se to the person skilled in the art, for example, in the manner which is described by way of example in the following examples. The person skilled in the art knows on the basis of his/her knowledge and on the basis of those synthesis routes, which are shown and described within the description of this invention, how to find other possible synthesis routes for compounds according to this invention. All these other possible synthesis routes are also part of this invention. Having described the invention in detail, the scope of the present invention is not limited only to those described characteristics or embodiments. As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, modifications, analogies, variations, derivations, homologisations and adaptations to the described invention can be made on the base of art-known knowledge and/or, particularly, on the base of the disclosure (e.g. the explicite, implicite or inherent disclosure) of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims. The following examples illustrate the invention in greater detail, without restricting it. As well, further compounds according to the present invention, of which the preparation is explicitly not described, can be prepared in an analogous way or in a way which is known by a person skilled in the art using customary preparation methods and process techniques. In the examples, m.p. stands for melting point, h for hours, d for days, min for minutes, TLC for thin layer chromatography, Rf for retention factor, MS for mass spectrum, M for molecular ion, other abbreviations have their meanings customary per se for the skilled person. The compounds which are mentioned in the examples as well as their salts or salt-free forms are preferred compounds of the invention. Examples Final products<br>

Commercial applicability<br>
The compounds according to the invention have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially<br>
utilizable. They are selective inhibitors of the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide synthases (NO-syntases,<br><br>
NOSs) are enzymes that generate NO and citrulline from the amino acid arginine. In certain pathophysiological situations such as arginine depletion or tetrahydrobiopterin depletion the generation of Or from NO-synthases instead or together with NO has been reported. NO is long known as a signalling molecule in most living organisms including mammals and humans. The most prominent action of NO is it's smooth muscle relaxing activity, which is caused on the molecular level by the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. In the last years a lot of other enzymes have been shown to be regulated by NO or reaction products of NO. There exist three isoforms of NO-synthases which fall into two classes and differ in their physiologic functions and molecular properties. The first class, known as constitutive NO-synthases, comprises of the endothelial NO-synthase and the neuronal NO-synthase. Both isoenzymes are expressed constitutively in various cell types, but are most prominent in endothelial cells of blood vessel walls (therefore called endothelial NO-synthase, eNOS or NOS-III) and in neuronal cells (therefore called neuronal NO-synthase, nNOS or NOS-I). Activation of these two enzymes is dependent on Ca2+/Calmodulin which is generated by transient increases of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Activation of constitutive isoforms leads to transient bursts of nitric oxide resulting in nanomolar cellular or tissue NO concentrations. The endothelial isoform is involved in the physiologic regulation of blood pressure. NO generated by the neuronal isoform seems to have neurotransmitter function and the neuronal isoform is among other regulatory processes involved in memory function (long term potentiation). In contrast to the constitutive isoforms the activation of inducible NO-synthase (iNOS, NOS-II), the sole member of the second class, is performed by transcriptional activation of the iNOS-promoter. Proinflammatory stimuli lead to transcription of the gene for inducible NO-synthase, which is catalytically active without increases in the intracellular Ca2+-concentration. Due to the long half live of the inducible NO-synthase and the unregulated activity of the enzyme, high micromolar concentrations of NO are generated over longer time periods. These high NO-concentrations alone or in cooperation with other reactive radicals such as Or are cytotoxic. Therefore, in situations of microbial infections, iNOS is involved in cell killing by macrophages and other immune cells during early nonspecific immune responses. There are a number of pathophysiological situations which among others are characterized by the high expression of inducible NO-synthase and concomitant high NO or 02" concentrations. It has been shown that these high NO concentrations alone or in combination with other radical species lead to tissue and organ damage and are causally involved in these pathophysiologies. As inflammation is characterized by the expression of proinflammatory enzymes, including inducible NO-synthase, acute and chronical inflammatory processes are promising diseases for the therapeutic application of selective inhibitors of inducible NO-synthase. Other pathophysiologies with high NO-production from inducible NO-synthase are several forms of shock (septic, hemorrhagic and cytokine-induced). It is clear that nonselective NO-synthase inhibitors will lead to cardiovascular and neuronal side effects due to concomitant inhibition of constitutive NO-synthase isoforms. It has been shown in in-vivo animal models of septic shock that reduction of circulating plasma NO-levels by NO-scavenger or inhibition of inducible NO-synthase restores systemic blood pressure, reduces organ damage and increases survival (deAngelo Exp. Opin. Pharmacother. 19-29, 1999; Redl et al. Shock 8, Suppl. 51, 1997; Strand et al. CritCare Med. 26,1490-1499,1998). It has also been shown that increased NO production during septic shock contributes to cardiac depression and myocardial dysfunction (Sun et al. J. Mol.Cell Cardiol. 30, 989-997, 1998). Furthermore there are also reports showing reduced infarct size after occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery in the presence of NO-synthase inhibitors (Wang et al. Am. J. Hyperttens. 12, 174-182, 1999). Considerable inducible NO-synthase activity is found in human cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, supporting the hypothesis that NO accounts at least in part for the dilatation and impaired contractility in these pathophysiologies (de Belder et al. Br. Heart. J. 4,426-430,1995). In animal models of acute or chronic inflammation, blockade of inducible NO-synthase by isoform-selective or nonselective inhibitors or genetic knock out improves therapeutic outcome. It is reported that experimental arthritis (Connor et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 273, 15-24, 1995) and osteoarthritis (Pelletier et al. Arthritis &amp; Rheum. 41, 1275-1286, 1998), experimental<br><br>
inflammations of the gastro-intestinal tract (Zingarelli et al. Gut 45,199-209,1999), experimental glomerulonephritis (Narita et al. Lab. Invest. 72, 17-24, 1995), experimental diabetes (Corbett et al. PNAS 90, 8992-8995, 1993), LPS-induced experimental lung injury is reduced by inhibition of inducible NO-synthase or in iNOS-knock out mice (Kristof et al. Am. J. Crit. Care. Med. 158, 1883-1889, 1998). A pathophysiological role of inducible NO-synthase derived NO or 92- is also discussed in chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and COPD.Furthermore, in models of neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS such as MPTP-induced parkinsonism, amyloid peptide induced Alzheimer's disease (Ishii et al., FASEB J. 14, 1485-1489, 2000), malonate induced Huntington's disease (Connop et al. Neuropharmacol. 35, 459-465,1996), experimental menengitis (Korytko &amp; Boje Neuropharmacol. 35, 231-237,1996) and experimental encephalitis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75,174-186,1997) a causal participation of NO and inducible NO-synthase has been shown.Increased iNOS expression has been found in the brains of AIDS victims and it is reasonable to assume a role of iNOS in AIDS related dementia (Bagasra et al. J. Neurovirol. 3 153-167,1997). Other studies implicated nitric oxide as a potential mediator of microglia dependent primary demyelination, a hallmark of multiple sklerosis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75,174-186,1997). An inflammatory reaction with concomitant expression of inducible NO-synthase also takes place during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (ladecola et al. Stroke 27,1373-1380,1996). Resulting NO together with O2- from infiltrating neutrophils is thought to be responsible for cellular and organ damage. Also, in models of traumatic brain injury (Mesenge et al. J. Neurotrauma 13, 209-214, 1996; Wada et al. Neurosurgery 43, 1427-1436, 1998) NO-synthase inhibitors have been show to posses protective properties. A regulatory role for inducible NO-synthase has been reported in various tumor cell lines (Tozer &amp; Everett Clin Oncol. 9. 357-264, 1997). On account of their inducible NO-synthase-inhibiting properties, the compounds according to the invention can be employed in human and veterinary medicine and therapeutics, where an excess of NO or Or due to increases in the activity of inducible NO-synthase is involved. They can be used without limitation for the treatment and prophylaxis of the following diseases: Acute inflammatory diseases: Septic shock, sepsis, SIRS, hemorrhagic shock, shock states induced by cytokine therapy (IL-2, TNF), organ transplantation and transplant rejection, head trauma, acute lung injury, ARDS, inflammatory skin conditions such as sunburn, inflammatory eye conditions such as uveitis, glaucoma and conjunctivitis. Chronic inflammatory diseases of peripheral organs and the CNS: gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, lung inflammatory diseases such as asthma and COPD, arthritic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis, heart disorders such as cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, artherosklerosis, neurogenic inflammation, skin diseases such as psoriasis, dermatitis and eczema, diabetes, glomerulonephritis; dementias such as dementias of the Alzheimer's type, vascular dementia, dementia due to a general medical condition, such as AIDS-, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's induced dementias, ALS, multiple sklerosis; necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis nodosa, serum sickness, Wegener's granulomatosis, Kawasaki's syndrom; headaches such as migraine, chronic tension headaches, cluster and vascular headaches, post-traumatic stress disorders; pain disorders such as neuropathic pain; myocardial and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The compounds may also be useful in the treatment of cancers that express nitric oxide synthase.

The method is characterized in that a therapeutically active and pharmacologically effective and tolerable amount of one or more of the compounds according to the invention is administered to the ill mammal. The invention further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of illnesses, especially the illnesses mentioned. The invention also relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of pharmaceutical compositions which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned.

furthermore relates to pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned, which contain one or more of the compounds according to the invention. The invention moreover relates to pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention having an iNOS inhibitory activity. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or excipients, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, caplets, suppositories, patches (e.g. as ITS), emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and where, by the appropriate choice of the auxiliaries and/or excipients, a pharmaceutical administration form (e.g. a delayed release form or an enteric form) exactly suited to the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action can be achieved. The person skilled in the art is familiar with auxiliaries or excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations on account of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel formers, ointment bases and other active compound excipients, for example antioxidants, dfepersants, emulsifiers, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants, complexing agents or permeation promoters, can be used. The administration of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be performed in any of the generally accepted modes of administration available in the art. Illustrative examples of suitable modes of administration include intravenous, oral, nasal, parenteral, topical, transdermal and rectal delivery. Oral and intravenous delivery are preferred. For the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention are preferably also administered by inhalation in the form of an aerosol; the aerosol particles of solid, liquid or mixed composition preferably having a diameter of 0.5 to 10 fjm, advantagously of 2 to 6 pm. Aerosol generation can be carried out, for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, but advantageously by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from inhalation capsules. Depending on the inhaler system used, in addition to the active compounds the administration forms additionally contain the required excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds. For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparatuses are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be'generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is as light as possible for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler® or the inhaler described in European Patent Application EP 0505 321), using which an optimal administration of active compound can be achieved. For the treatment of dermatoses, the compounds according to the invention are in particular administered in the form of those pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for topical application. For the production of the pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are preferably mixed with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and further processed to give suitable pharmaceutical formulations. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations are, for example, powders, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, fatty ointments, creams, pastes, gels or solutions. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are prepared by processes known per se. The dosage of the active compounds is carried out in the order of magnitude customary for iNOS inhibitors. Topical application forms (such as ointments) for the treatment of dermatoses thus contain the active compounds in a concentration of, for example, 0.1-99%. The dose for administration by inhalation is customarly between 0.1 and 10 mg per day. The customary dose in the case of systemic therapy (p.o.) is between 0.3 and 30 mg/kg per day, (i. v.) is between 0.3 and 30 mg/kg/h. Biological investigations Measurement of inducible NO-synthase activity The assay is performed in 96-well microtiter F-plates (Greiner,<br><br>
Frickenhausen, FRG) in a total volume of 100 pi in the presence of 100 nM calmodulin, 226 pM CaClj, 477 pM MgCb, 5 pM flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD), 5 pM flavin mononucleotide (FMN), 0.1 mM NADPH, 7 mM glutathione, 10 pM BH4 and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.2. Arginine concentrations are 0.1 pM for enzyme inhibition experiments. 150000 dpm of [3H]arginine are added to the assay mixture. Enzyme reaction is started by the addition of 4 pg of a crude cytosolic fraction containing human inducible NO-synthase and the reaction mixture is incubated for 45 to 60 min at 37°C. Enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 10 pi of 2M MES-buffer pH 5,0. 50 pi of the incubation mixture are transferred into a MADP N65 filtration microtiter plate (Millipore, Eschborn, FRG) containing already 50 pi of AG-50W-X8 cation exchange resin (Biorad, Miinchen, FRG). The resin in the Na loaded form is pre-equilibrated in water and 70 pi (corresponding to 50 pi dry beads) are pipetted under heavy stirring with a 8 channel pipette into the filtration plate. After pipetting 50 pi of the enzyme reaction mixture onto the filtration plates, the plates are placed on a filtration manifold (Porvair, Shepperton, UK) and the flow through is collected in Pico scintillation plates (Packard, Meriden, CT). The resin in the filtration plates is washed with 75 pi of water (1x50 pi and 1x 25 pi) which is also collected in the same plate as the sample. The total flow through of 125 pi is mixed with 175 pi of Microscint-40 scintillation cocktail (Packard) and the scintillation plate is sealed with TopSeal P-foil (Packard). Scintillation plates are counted in a szintillation counter. For the measurement of inducible NO-synthase-inhibiting potencies of compounds increasing concentrations of inhibitors were included into the incubation mixture. ICso-values were calculated from the percent inhibition at given concentrations by nonlinear least square fitting. Representative inhibitory values determined for the compounds according to the invention follow from the following table A, in which the compound numbers correspond to the example numbers.
