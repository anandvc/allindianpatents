				<td>Description<br>
Method for storing a data block containing data for<br>
controlling a technical process, and control and automation<br>
device<br>
The present invention relates to a method for storing a<br>
data block containing data for controlling a technical<br>
process in a memory area of an automation device. The<br>
present invention further relates to a control device for<br>
controlling the storage of the data block and to an<br>
automation device.<br>
For the purpose of controlling the technical process an<br>
automation device of the aforesaid kind typically contains<br>
a data block in which functions, parameters and other data<br>
for executing control sequences are specified. The data<br>
block is also referred to as a function block. The data<br>
block corresponds to an automation program or code for the<br>
sequence control system in the automation device.<br>
When process control functions are being planned and<br>
configured, the desired automation functions for<br>
controlling the technical process are assembled,<br>
parameterized and interconnected in the form of graphical<br>
control blocks. The control blocks representing the<br>
automation functions are contained in a special program<br>
library, for example, from which they can be called. The<br>
parameterized and interconnected control blocks are<br>
equivalent to a configuration program which is subsequently<br>
supplied to a code generator which compiles the<br><br>
configuration program and converts it into a format which<br>
can be understood and processed by the automation device.<br>
The compiled configuration program generated by the code<br>
generator corresponds to the data block. The latter is<br>
typically subdivided into a plurality of data areas in<br>
which in particular data by means of which a specific sub-<br>
functionality can be executed is concentrated. The<br>
generated and compiled data block must subsequently be<br>
loaded into the automation device.<br>
Usually a newly generated data block is supplied to the<br>
automation device in full, i.e. in particular complete with<br>
all its data areas, via a communication line connected to<br>
the automation device and a suitable communication service,<br>
and stored in said automation device. This normally happens<br>
during the operation of the automation device, i.e. while<br>
the latter is controlling the technical process by means of<br>
another data block stored in it. Said other data block is<br>
subsequently to be replaced by the new data block loaded<br>
into the automation device. As the data block may in<br>
certain cases, depending on the configuration on which it<br>
is based, contain a large volume of data, long load times<br>
can result when the data block is transferred to the<br>
automation device.<br>
In contemporary instrumentation and control systems there<br>
is, however, a requirement for short generation and load<br>
times, in particular during commissioning of technical<br>
installations, in order to allow changes in the<br>
configuration, and hence also in the data block resulting<br>
therefrom, to take effect as quickly as possible in the<br><br>
automation device, and in the control of the technical<br>
process performed by it. Fast loading of the data block<br>
into the automation device is also made more difficult due<br>
to the fact that, between a control device for controlling<br>
the loading of the new data block, i.e. what is known as an<br>
application server, and the automation device, a plurality<br>
of communication channels are active on the communication<br>
line connecting them. Additional services that have to<br>
provide process values, alarms, etc. with very short delay<br>
times for the ongoing operation of the automation device<br>
are handled via said communication channels. Said<br>
additional services provide information relating to the<br>
current status of the process and receive suitable control<br>
commands. Said additional information and control channels<br>
have a much higher priority by comparison with the<br>
configuration channel that serves for transferring the new<br>
data block. Thus, only a limited bandwidth of the<br>
communication line is available for transferring the data<br>
of the new data block.<br>
The object underlying the present invention is to enable a<br>
data block to be loaded into an automation device in a<br>
technically simple manner.<br>
This object is achieved on the method side by means of the<br>
technical teaching of claim 1 and on the device side by<br>
means of the technical teaching of claim 8 or claim 9.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention can be derived<br>
from the dependent claims.<br><br>
With the inventive method for storing a first data block<br>
containing data for controlling a technical process in a<br>
first memory area of an automation device, wherein a second<br>
data block containing data for controlling the technical<br>
process is stored in a second memory area of the automation<br>
device and the first data block and the second data block<br>
are subdivided into a plurality of data areas, at least one<br>
data area which is part of the first data block is supplied<br>
to the automation device. The supplied first data block is<br>
then stored in the first memory area. Furthermore, at least<br>
one data area which is both part of the first data block<br>
and part of the second data block is copied from the second<br>
memory area into the first memory area.<br>
The inventive control device for controlling the storing of<br>
a first data block containing data for controlling a<br>
technical process in a first memory area of an automation<br>
device which contains, in a second memory area, a second<br>
data block containing data for controlling the technical<br>
process, wherein the first data block and the second data<br>
block are subdivided into a plurality of data areas, is<br>
embodied such that it controls the supplying of at least<br>
one data area which is part of the first data block to the<br>
automation device. In addition it initiates the copying of<br>
at least one data area which is both part of the first data<br>
block and part of the second data block from the second<br>
memory area into the first memory area.<br>
The inventive automation device contains a first memory<br>
area for storing a first data block containing data for<br>
controlling a technical process, and a second memory area<br><br>
in which a second data block containing data for<br>
controlling the technical process is stored, the first data<br>
block and the second data block being subdivided into a<br>
plurality of data areas. An interface is present for<br>
receiving at least one data area which is part of the first<br>
data block. In addition the automation device contains a<br>
controller for controlling the storing of the received at<br>
least one data area in the first memory area and for<br>
controlling the copying of at least one data area which is<br>
both part of the first data block and part of the second<br>
data block from the second memory area into the first<br>
memory area.<br>
According to the present invention, load times for loading<br>
the first data block into the automation device can<br>
advantageously be kept short. A data area of the second<br>
data block which is already present in the automation<br>
device and which is also part of the first data block does<br>
not necessarily have to be supplied once again to the<br>
automation device. Rather, the already present data area<br>
can be copied within the automation device into the first<br>
memory area provided for the first data block. The first<br>
data block in this case contains updated data which is to<br>
be used for controlling the process in the future. The<br>
second data block contains momentarily current data which<br>
is used for example for controlling the process at the<br>
present moment in time. Functions, parameters and other<br>
data for executing instrumentation and control sequences<br>
that are controlled by the automation device are specified<br>
in the first and second data block. In particular data by<br>
means of which a specific sub-functionality can be executed<br><br>
during the controlling of the process by means of the<br>
automation device is concentrated in the data areas into<br>
which the data blocks are subdivided. The data blocks<br>
represent in particular an automation code which determines<br>
the sequencing control of the automation device. The at<br>
least one data area of the first data block which is<br>
supplied to the automation device is transferred to the<br>
latter in particular via an interface of the automation<br>
device from the outside. This is advantageous in particular<br>
when said at least one data area of the first data block is<br>
not part of the second data block. On account of the<br>
invention it is advantageously possible to keep the number<br>
of data areas of the first data block that are to be<br>
supplied to the automation device to a minimum. As a result<br>
a communication line that is used for supplying the data of<br>
the data areas is subject to very little load by the<br>
loading of the data areas of the first data block. Storing<br>
or assembling the first data block in the first memory area<br>
of the automation device or filling the first memory area<br>
with the first data block can therefore be performed<br>
particularly quickly. The invention is particularly<br>
effective above all when copying the at least one data area<br>
of the second data block that is already present in the<br>
automation device can be performed more efficiently in<br>
terms of time than supplying said data area from the<br>
outside. On the automation device side a service is<br>
provided which supports the copying of at least one data<br>
area between two memory areas provided for two data blocks.<br>
Furthermore, said service advantageously allows said<br>
copying to take place between different positions within<br>
the memory areas and the at least one supplied data area to<br><br>
be inserted at a specific position in the first memory<br>
area. It is advantageously possible to implement the<br>
invention particularly efficiently such that the computing<br>
time required for specifying a sequence for supplying a<br>
plurality of data areas to the automation device, and in<br>
particular also for copying data areas from the second into<br>
the first memory area, can be kept very short. Said<br>
specifying of the sequence is performed in particular in<br>
the inventive control device.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention a check is<br>
carried out to determine whether one of the data areas of<br>
the first data block is also part of the second data block.<br>
This advantageously takes place before the data area is<br>
supplied to the automation device. By this means it can be<br>
ascertained particularly quickly and reliably and in an<br>
automated manner whether the at least one data area<br>
necessarily has to be supplied to the automation device or<br>
whether possibly it can be copied into the first memory<br>
area within the automation device.<br>
In a further, particularly advantageous embodiment the<br>
volume of data contained in one of the data areas which is<br>
both part of the first data block and part of the second<br>
data block is determined. Depending on what volume of data<br>
is determined, the data area is either copied from the<br>
second memory area into the first memory area or supplied<br>
to the automation device and stored in the first memory<br>
area. In this way it can be ascertained in a simple manner<br>
whether it is more efficient to supply the at least one<br>
data area of the automation device from the outside or to<br><br>
copy it from one area to another within the automation<br>
device. The determined volume of data is preferably<br>
compared with a threshold data volume. The data area is<br>
then copied from the second memory area into the first<br>
memory area if the determined volume of data is greater<br>
than the threshold data volume. If the determined volume of<br>
data is less than the threshold data volume, the data area<br>
is supplied to the automation device and stored in the<br>
first memory area. By this means it can advantageously be<br>
ensured that the communication resources serving for<br>
supplying the data area are particularly efficiently<br>
utilized. When the threshold data volume is specified it<br>
can be taken into account in particular that, both for<br>
supplying and for copying the data area, control data<br>
accumulates which also imposes a load on the communication<br>
resources and on the automation device likewise.<br>
Furthermore the threshold data volume is preferably<br>
specified as a function of a determined status of at least<br>
one component that is used for storing the first data block<br>
and/or for supplying the at least one data area of the<br>
first data block to the automation device. Such a component<br>
can be for example the inventive control device or a<br>
communication line that is used for supplying the at least<br>
one data area. This enables the threshold data volume to be<br>
adjusted particularly precisely to a current system<br>
environment of the automation device, and in particular to<br>
the latter itself. The threshold data volume can be<br>
particularly advantageously determined automatically.<br>
Toward that end, actual measurements of the current status<br><br>
of the at least one component can be performed in<br>
particular.<br>
It is particularly preferred if the threshold data volume<br>
is specified adaptively. In this way the specifying of the<br>
threshold data volume can be adjusted progressively more<br>
precisely to the statuses of the at least one component. As<br>
a result the data areas of the first data block can be<br>
stored or assembled particularly efficiently.<br>
Before the first data block is stored in the first memory<br>
area of the automation device, the copying of the at least<br>
one data area which is both part of the first data block<br>
and part of the second data block and the supplying of the<br>
at least one data area which is part of the first data<br>
block to the automation device are preferably validated.<br>
The specification of the sequence for supplying data areas<br>
to the automation device and for copying data areas within<br>
the automation device can thus be checked in advance for<br>
possibly occurring errors. The storing of the first data<br>
block can therefore be aborted where necessary or even not<br>
started at all. It would also be possible to supply the<br>
first data block complete with all data areas in its<br>
entirety to the automation device. A problematic<br>
retroactive effect on the control of the process by the<br>
automation device currently in operation can thus be<br>
advantageously avoided. The instructions contained in the<br>
sequence can be verified for example in a specific<br>
automation code loading device by simulating operations for<br>
supplying and copying data areas on the basis of available<br>
data.<br><br>
The invention and its advantages are explained in more<br>
detail below with reference to examples and exemplary<br>
embodiments and the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>

control system,<br>

Unless indicated otherwise, identical or functionally<br>
identical elements are labeled by the same reference signs<br>
throughout the figures.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a process control<br>
system 1 for controlling a technical process which is<br>
implemented in an installation. Such an installation may be<br>
for example a power station or a chemical plant. The<br>
process control system 1 includes a configuration device 2<br>
by means of which instrumentation and control functions for<br>
controlling the technical process can be configured. For<br><br>
that purpose a graphical function plan is produced in which<br>
desired automation functions are placed, parameterized and<br>
interconnected in the form of graphical function blocks.<br>
The configuration device 2 includes inter alia a graphical<br>
user interface and a program library. The program library<br>
contains a plurality of control blocks which represent the<br>
graphical function blocks. At configuration time the<br>
control blocks are called from the program library,<br>
interconnected and provided with parameters. In this way a<br>
configuration program is assembled. The process control<br>
system 1 includes a control device 3 to which the assembled<br>
configuration program is supplied. The control device 3 has<br>
a code generator 4 which compiles the configuration program<br>
and translates it into a specific format. Said format can<br>
be processed by an automation device 5 of the process<br>
control system 1. The compiled configuration program<br>
corresponds to a data block in which the previously<br>
assembled functions, parameters and other data are<br>
contained. The data block serves the automation device 5<br>
for controlling the process. Accordingly the data block<br>
represents the desired sequencing control that is to be<br>
executed by the automation device 5. The data block is<br>
subdivided into a plurality of data areas. The data<br>
concentrated in the data areas includes in particular data<br>
by means of which specific sub-functionalities for<br>
controlling the process can be executed by means of the<br>
automation device.<br>
The automation device 5 includes an interface 6 via which<br>
it can receive data and signals from the outside and send<br>
data and signals to the outside. For that purpose the<br><br>
automation device 5 is connected to the control device 3<br>
via a communication line 7. By way of the communication<br>
line 7 it is possible for, inter alia, the compiled data<br>
block, or parts thereof, such as, for example, one or more<br>
data areas, to be transferred from the control device 3 to<br>
the automation device 5 and received by the interface 6.<br>
Information and operation and control services by means of<br>
which process values and alarms, etc., and operation and<br>
control parameters for controlling the process are also<br>
exchanged and transferred via the communication line 7<br>
between the control device 3 and the automation device 5.<br>
The automation device 5 additionally includes a controller<br>
8 by means of which the sequences in the automation device<br>
5 are controlled. The automation device 5 further includes<br>
a first memory area 9 for storing a first data block and a<br>
second memory area 10 for storing a second data block.<br>
Other memory areas for further data blocks may also be<br>
present. The automation device 5 controls the process by<br>
means of one of the data blocks contained in the memory<br>
areas 9, 10. For certain reasons or on certain occasions,<br>
such as, for example, in a fault situation, during<br>
commissioning of the system performing the process, for<br>
maintenance activities or in an optimization operation, the<br>
automation device 5 can switch over from the second to the<br>
first data block, or vice versa,, to allow a change in<br>
control of the process. The described components of the<br>
automation device 5, i.e. the interface 6, the controller 8<br>
and the two memory areas 9 and 10, are connected to a bus<br>
11 via which they can transfer data and signals.<br><br>
In the present exemplary embodiment the second data block<br>
is already stored in the second memory area 10. At the<br>
present moment in time the automation device 5 controls the<br>
process by means of said second data block. The second data<br>
block is therefore a momentarily current data block. The<br>
first memory area 9 is still empty at this time. The aim is<br>
to store the first data block, which represents a<br>
configuration program that has been newly created by means<br>
of the configuration device 2 and compiled by the code<br>
generator 4, in the first memory area 9. The first data<br>
block is currently stored in the control device 3. The<br>
automation device 5 is to control the process in the future<br>
by means of the first data block. The first data block is<br>
therefore an updated data block which contains updated<br>
functions by comparison with the second data block, for<br>
example in order to optimize the execution of the process.<br>
The control device 3 now has the task, in conjunction with<br>
the automation device 5, of storing the newly created first<br>
data block in the first memory area 9.<br>
According to the invention this operation does not entail<br>
transferring the first data block in its entirety from the<br>
control device 3 via the communication line 7 to the<br>
automation device 5. Rather, a check is first carried out<br>
to determine which of the data areas of the first data<br>
block are already contained in the second data block stored<br>
in the second memory area 10. If it is discovered that at<br>
least one data area is both part of the first and part of<br>
the second data block, then a check is carried out to<br>
determine whether it is better to supply said at least one<br>
data area to the automation device 5 via the communication<br><br>
line 7 from the control device 3 so that the latter stores<br>
it in the first memory area 9, or to copy said at least one<br>
data area within the automation device 5 from the second<br>
memory area 10 to a specific, predetermined position in the<br>
first memory area 9.<br>
The examples described in the following with reference to<br>
Figs. 2-5 illustrate possible approaches to storing or<br>
assembling data areas of the first data block in the first<br>
memory area 9. In Figs. 2-5 the first memory area 9<br>
containing the first data block is in each case shown on<br>
the extreme right, as it is ultimately to be stored or<br>
assembled in the first memory area 9. The assembling of the<br>
data areas in the first memory area 9 according to the<br>
illustration on the right thus corresponds to the objective<br>
of copy and transfer or supply operations that are to be<br>
carried out. Shown on the extreme left in each case in<br>
Figs. 2-5 is the second memory area 10 containing the<br>
second data block, which is currently stored in the second<br>
memory area 10. To illustrate the procedure, between the<br>
first memory area 9 shown on the right with the target<br>
composition of the data areas of the first data block and<br>
the second memory area 10 shown on the left with the<br>
existing second data block the figures show one or more<br>
intermediate states in the storing of data areas in the<br>
first memory area 9 which result after copy and/or transfer<br>
operations have been carried out.<br><br>
In the following examples a data area is represented by a<br>
rectangle containing a specific designation of the data<br>
area, e.g. data area A:<br><br>
A copy operation for copying one or more data areas from<br>
the second memory area 10 to a predetermined position in<br>
the first memory area 9 is represented by two opposing<br>
curly brackets:<br><br>
A transfer operation for supplying one or more data areas<br>
from the control device 3 to the automation device 5 in<br>
order to store the transferred data areas at a specific<br>
position in the first memory area 9 is represented by an<br>
arrow:<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a first example of the storing or assembling<br>
of a first data block 20 in the first memory area 9 of the<br>
automation device 5. The first data block 20, as it is<br>
ultimately to be assembled, is shown on the right. The<br>
first data block 20 contains, in the following order from<br>
top to bottom, data areas A, F, C, G and a data area E. On<br>
the left Fig. 2 also shows a second data block 21 stored in<br>
the second memory area 10. Said second data block 21<br><br>
contains, in the following order from top to bottom, data<br>
areas A, B, C, D and the data area E. It is assumed in this<br>
example that the data blocks 20 and 21 are structured in<br>
the manner of an index or register. This means that the<br>
same data areas are also present at the same positions in<br>
the two data blocks 20, 21. This simplifies a check that is<br>
to be carried out by the control device 3 in order to<br>
determine whether one of the data areas of the first data<br>
block 20 that is to be assembled is also contained in the<br>
second data block 21. In the present example the control<br>
device 3 has ascertained in the course of checking that the<br>
data areas A, C and E are contained at the same positions<br>
both in the second data area 21 and in the first data area<br>
20 that is to be assembled. The data areas B and D of the<br>
second data block 21 are to be replaced by the data areas F<br>
and G, respectively, in the first data block 20.<br>
In order to store or assemble the first data block 20, the<br>
complete second data block 21 is first copied in a copy<br>
operation from the second memory area 10 into the first<br>
memory area 9. The first memory area 9 then contains in<br>
this first intermediate state the data areas A, B, C, D and<br>
E, in that order. In a subsequent step the data area F is<br>
supplied in a transfer operation from the control device 3<br>
via the communication line 7 to the automation device 5,<br>
received there by the interface 6 and within the automation<br>
device 5 stored between the data areas A and C in the first<br>
memory area 9. The previously stored data area B is<br>
overwritten in the process. Thus, according to the second<br>
intermediate state, the data areas A, F, C, D and E are<br>
stored, in that order, in the first memory area 9. In a<br><br>
subsequent step the data area G is then supplied in a<br>
further transfer operation by the control device 3 via the<br>
communication line 7 to the automation device 5, received<br>
there by the interface 6 and within the automation device 5<br>
stored between the data areas C and E in the first memory<br>
area 9. The previously stored data area D is overwritten in<br>
the process. Thus, the data areas A, F, C, G and E are<br>
stored, in that order, in the first memory area 9. This<br>
assembling of the data areas in the first memory area 9<br>
corresponds to the desired target composition of the data<br>
areas of the first data block 20.<br>
In the present example according to Fig. 2 the first data<br>
block has therefore been assembled by means of one copy and<br>
two transfer operations. It was not necessary in this case<br>
for the data areas A, C and E associated with the first<br>
data block 20 to be supplied by the control device 3 via<br>
the communication line 7 to the automation device 5. A data<br>
volume resulting from said data areas A, C and E does not<br>
therefore have to be transferred via the communication line<br>
7. In order to determine the most favorable combination of<br>
copy and transfer operations the control device 3 checks<br>
what volumes of data are contained in each of the data<br>
areas A, C and E which are both part of the first data<br>
block 20 and part of the second data block 21. Equally, the<br>
total volume of data contained in said data areas A, C and<br>
E can be ascertained. In order to determine whether it is<br>
more favorable to copy one of the data areas from the<br>
second memory area 10 or to supply it to the automation<br>
device 5 via the communication line 7, a threshold data<br>
volume is specified. In addition to the data volume of one<br><br>
or more of the data areas, the threshold data volume takes<br>
into account control data requiring to be transferred via<br>
the communication line 7, which control data accumulates<br>
during controlling of the transfer and supply of the one or<br>
more of the data areas via the communication line 7 to the<br>
automation device 5. For example, when data areas are<br>
transferred in two operations, as is the case in the<br>
example described previously with reference to Fig. 2 in<br>
the successive transfer of the two data areas F and G in<br>
two transfer operations, more control data accumulates than<br>
in a single transfer of one or more of the data areas. The<br>
determined volumes of data contained in the data areas A, C<br>
and E are compared with the threshold data volume.<br>
Depending on the result of said comparison, one or more of<br>
the data areas are copied from the second memory area 10<br>
into the first memory area 9 if the determined volume of<br>
data contained in the one or more of the data areas is<br>
greater than or equal to the threshold data volume. If the<br>
determined volume is less than the threshold data volume,<br>
then the one or more of the data areas are supplied to the<br>
automation device and stored in the first memory area 9. In<br>
the first example described with reference to Fig. 2 the<br>
data volume of the data area C exceeds the threshold data<br>
volume. It is therefore more favorable to copy the data<br>
area C from the second memory area 10 into the first memory<br>
area 9, and hence to perform two transfer operations in<br>
order to transfer the data areas F and G, than to transfer<br>
the data areas F, C and G jointly via the communication<br>
line 7 and in that case control only a single transfer<br>
operation.<br><br>
To illustrate this, Fig. 3 shows a second example of the<br>
storing of the first data block 20 in the first memory area<br>
9. In this second example the data volume of the data area<br>
C is less than the specified threshold data volume. In a<br>
first step the data areas A and E are therefore copied<br>
separately to the same positions from the second memory<br>
area 10 into the first memory area 9. In the intermediate<br>
state according to Fig. 3 the first memory area 9 therefore<br>
contains the data areas A and E at the topmost position and<br>
bottommost position, respectively. It is also possible,<br>
instead of performing two separate copy operations for the<br>
data areas A and E, to perform a single copy operation with<br>
the data areas A, B, C, D and E of the entire second data<br>
block 21. In a second step a single transfer operation is<br>
then performed with the supplying of the data areas F, C<br>
and G from the control device 3 to the automation device 5.<br>
The supplied data areas F, C and G are inserted between the<br>
data areas A and E. The complete first data block 20 is<br>
then stored in the first memory area 9.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a third example of the storing or assembling<br>
of a different first data block 22 in the first memory area<br>
9 of the automation device 5. The first data block 22, as<br>
it is ultimately to be assembled, is shown on the right.<br>
The first data block 22 contains, in the following order<br>
from top to bottom, data areas A, F, B, C and D. On the<br>
left, Fig. 4 also shows the second data block 21 stored in<br>
the second memory area 10, containing the data areas A, B,<br>
C, D and E. It is assumed in this example that, in contrast<br>
to the examples according to Figs. 2 and 3, the data blocks<br>
21 and 22 are not structured in the manner of an index or<br><br>
register. This means that data areas can be inserted or<br>
deleted in the data blocks and adjacent data areas shifted<br>
accordingly. The same data areas are therefore not<br>
necessarily present at the same positions within the data<br>
blocks.<br>
In the present example the control device 3 has established<br>
in the course of checking that the data areas A, B, C and D<br>
are contained both in the second data area 21 and in the<br>
first data area 22 that is to be assembled. The data area A<br>
is at the same position in both data blocks 21 and 22. In<br>
the first data block 22 the data areas B, C and D are<br>
provided in different positions in the first data block 22,<br>
shifted downward compared to the second data block 21. A<br>
new data area F is to be inserted between the data areas A<br>
and B of the first data block 22. The data area E of the<br>
second data block 21 is no longer required in the first<br>
data block 22.<br>
In order to store or assemble the first data block 22, the<br>
data area A is first copied in a copy operation from the<br>
second memory area 10 into the first memory area 9. Also,<br>
the data areas B, C and D are copied in a copy and shift<br>
operation from the second memory area 10 to a different<br>
position in the first memory area 9. The first memory area<br>
9 then contains in an intermediate state the data areas A,<br>
B, C and D, in that order, with storage space initially<br>
remaining empty between the data areas A and B. In a<br>
subsequent step the data area F is supplied in a transfer<br>
operation from the control device 3 via the communication<br>
line 7 to the automation device 5, received there by the<br><br>
interface 6 and within the automation device 5 stored in<br>
the first memory area 9 between the data areas A and B.<br>
Thus, the data areas A, F, B, C and D are stored, in that<br>
order, in the first memory area 9. This assembling of the<br>
data areas in the first memory area 9 corresponds to the<br>
desired target composition of the data areas of the first<br>
data block 22.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a fourth example of the storing or assembling<br>
of a further first data block 23 in the first memory area 9<br>
of the automation device 5. The first data block 23, as it<br>
is ultimately to be assembled, is shown on the right. The<br>
first data block 23 contains, in the following order from<br>
top to bottom, data areas F, A, G, C, D and H. On the left,<br>
Fig. 5 also shows the second data block 21 stored in the<br>
second memory area 10, containing the data areas A, B, C, D<br>
and E. It is again assumed in this example that data areas<br>
can be inserted or deleted in the data blocks 23 and 21 and<br>
adjacent data areas shifted accordingly. The same data<br>
areas are therefore not necessarily present at the same<br>
positions within the data blocks.<br>
In the present fourth example the control device 3 has<br>
established in the course of checking that the data areas<br>
A, C and D are contained both in the second data area 21<br>
and in the first data area 23 that is to be assembled. In<br>
the first data block 23 the data areas A, C and D are<br>
provided in different positions in the first data block 23,<br>
shifted downward compared to the second data block 21.<br><br>
In order to store or assemble the first data block 23, the<br>
data areas A, B, C and D are first copied in a copy and<br>
shift operation from the second memory area 10 to different<br>
positions in the first memory area 9. The first memory area<br>
9 then contains in an intermediate state the data areas A<br>
B, C and D, in that order. In a subsequent step the data<br>
areas F, G and H are supplied in transfer operations from<br>
the control device 3 via the communication line 7 to the<br>
automation device 5, received there by the interface 6 and<br>
within the automation device 5 stored in the first memory<br>
area 9. The data area F is inserted at the topmost position<br>
in the first memory area 9, the data area H at the<br>
bottommost position and the data area G between the data<br>
areas A and C. The data area B is overwritten in the<br>
process. Thus, the data areas F, A, G, C, D and H are<br>
stored, in that order, in the first memory area 9. This<br>
assembling of the data areas in the first memory area 9<br>
corresponds to the desired target composition of the data<br>
areas of the first data block 23.<br>
In the combination of copy, shift and transfer operations<br>
described it was assumed in the fourth example that the<br>
data area G has a small data volume corresponding to that<br>
of the data area B. Otherwise a separate copying of the<br>
data area A on the one hand and the data areas C and D on<br>
the other hand would have been more efficient.<br>
According to the present invention it is advantageously<br>
possible to specify the threshold data volume as a function<br>
of a determined status of at least one component of the<br>
process control system 1. This applies in particular to the<br><br>
communication line 7, the controller 8 and/or the bus 11 of<br>
the automation device 5. In particular the utilization of<br>
their capacities can be relevant thereto. This enables the<br>
threshold data volume to be adjusted particularly precisely<br>
to a current status of the process control system 1. The<br>
threshold data volume is determined in particular<br>
automatically. This can be accomplished particularly<br>
advantageously by adaptive means. Toward that end actual<br>
measurements of the current status of the at least one<br>
component can be carried out in particular.<br>
Before one of the copy and/or transfer operations for<br>
storing the first data block 20, 22 or 23 in the first<br>
memory area 9 is actually performed it is advantageous in<br>
this case to validate or simulate the chosen combination,<br>
or sequence, of the copy and/or transfer operations. In<br>
this way possibly occurring errors can be identified before<br>
said operations are actually performed. It would then be<br>
possible to supply the complete first data block with all<br>
its data areas from the control device 3 to the automation<br>
device 5. A problematic retroactive effect on the control<br>
of the process by the automation device 5 currently in<br>
operation can thus be avoided.<br><br>
