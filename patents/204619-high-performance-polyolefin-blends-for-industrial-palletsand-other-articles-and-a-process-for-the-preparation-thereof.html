HIGH   PERFORMANOB) POLYOLEFIN   BLENDS. FOR   INDUSTRIAL   PALLETS   AMQ, OTHER ARTICLES AND A PROCEBB FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF*<br><br><br><br><br>
We, INDIAN PETROCHEMICALS CORPORATION LIMITED, a Government of India Company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of P. O. Petrochemicals, District Vadodara 391 346, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to high performance polypropylene copolymer blends and a process for the preparation thereof. The compounds of this invention exhibit very high mechanical properties at moderate concentrations of EPDM and/or filler, and can be made into industrial pallets either by injection molding or by thermoforrning. The process is ideally carried out employing a corotating twin-screw extruder. Background of the Invention:<br>
Pallets have assumed an indispensable place in product storing and transferring in many industries. Traditionally pallets are made up of wood, weighing at least 50 kg. each with an average life span of 6-9 months. These pallets during the industrial rigors of rough handling, chip off, break down, expose the nails which would tear off the bags leading to the generation of sweep-off grade (polymer granules) materials. During rainy seasons, if wooden pallets get wet with water, resulting in weakening of their performance and reduction in their life span. Wood is also a good substrate for the growth of fungus and bacteria, especially under moist conditions, which is a severe disadvantage. The nails used in the pallets tend to rust and can cause cargo damage or injuries.<br>
With the increasing environment responsibility, wooden pallets are gradually discouraged and may be eventually discarded. Attempts to form pallets from other materials in order to avoid the disadvantages inherent in wooden pallets have been only partially successful. Metallic pallets, which were once considered to be ready alternatives for wooden pallets, were soon found to be unwieldy, inconvenient and even unsafe, because of their heavy weight and tendency to cause noise while in use in bagging sections. Accordingly, metallic pallets are gradually becoming unacceptable in the industry.<br>
Plastic pallets, both thermoset as well as thermoplastic, made their modest entry into this high demanding, rough and tough application. The plastic pallet performance is influenced mainly by two factors 1) the performance properties of the pallet material and 2) the design of the pallet. The thermoset pallets, particularly the FRP pallets, chip off during use and bend heavily under load (of nearly 2 tons) leading to problems for entry of forklift. Hence these too are unacceptable and are discouraged. Thus, there is an urgent need for a thermoplastic pallet capable of meeting the demands of the industry. It is also desirable that pallets meet the long-term investment value such as cost-per-use and life cycle considerations. Thus , there is an immediate need for a pallet design comprising a plastic material that overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
2<br><br>
It is desirable, specifically, to provide a pallet that is inexpensive and relatively light in weight but yet strong, and which is formed of recyclable material, stackable, capable of being assembled on site, capable of being picked up by a fork lift, resistant to the growth of fungus and bacteria, and capable of being easily cleaned whenever required.<br>
Several attempts have been made for developing load bearing thermoplastic pallets. US Patent 5,955,546 (1999) issued to Bates et al., describes a process for preparing melt-miscible polyolefin blends of two or more polyolefns. US Patents 5,861,463 (1999) and 6,140,420 (2000) issued to Sehanobish et al., describe methods for making melt processable impact-modified thermoplastic compositions and articles fabricated therefrom. Another US Patent 5,404,829 (1995) issued to Shuert, provides a design for rackable plastic pallet with an upper plastic platform and lower plastic base interconnected by leg or strut structures. Another US Patent 6,123,032 (2000) issued to Ohenesian, describes an improved load bearing pallet including at least an upper deck formed of a sheet preferably of plastic with a load engaging surface on one side of the sheet and a lift engaging surface on the other. In another US Patent 6,138,532 (2000) issued to Fujii et al., a synthetic resin pallet and manufacturing method therefor was described. And yet in another US Patent 6,125,770 (2000) issued to Bradenburg, a load-bearing plastic pallet with optional reinforcement members, which reduce a flexure of the pallet deck, was illustrated. Objects of the Invention:<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide high performance thermoplastic polyolefin compounds that allow injection molding, compression molding, therrnoforming and other conventional techniques to be applied for making industrial pallets or other end products such as crates, auto parts, furniture, storage and transport containers and seats for motorcycles.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for preparing high performance thermoplastic polyolefin compounds that exhibit very high mechanical properties.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide an improved process for the preparation of high performance thermoplastic polyolefin compounds that exhibit very high mechanical properties.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide an improved process for the preparation of high performance thermoplastic polyolefin compounds which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art pallets. Summary of the Invention:<br>
The above and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing high performance   thermoplastic   polyolefin   compounds   which   by   blending   together   a<br>
3<br><br>
polyolefin   copolymer',   preferably,   a   polypropylene   copolymer   (PPCP)   with   ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM).<br>
In particular, the invention provides a process for preparation of polyolefin copolymers, preferably, polypropylene copolymer blends with EPDM and/or talc or CaC03 extruded together in a twin-screw extruder while the temperature of the extruders is maintained in tht; range of 150-2100C and the screws are rotated at a speed of 20-100 r.p.m.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a thermoplastic polyolefin blend which comprises of a base polymer and up to 25% by wt of an ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM}, the balance if any cons isting of a conventional filler and/or a conventional compatibilizer or interfacial agent<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of thermoplastic polyolefin blends which comprises extruding a base polymer with ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)at a temperature in the range of from 150 to 210°C<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the polypropylene copolymer has a melt flow index in the r^nge: 1-4 g/10 min. when tested at 230°C with 2.16 kg load (according to ASTM P1238); and ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) has an ethylene content in the range: 55-65 wt%, possessing specific gravity in the range: 0.86-0.90; and Mooney viscosity in the range: 36-77 [ML^ 125°Cj.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the compounds possess an Izod impact strength {notched samples) in the range: 14-80 kg.cm/cm for samples of thickness 3.2 mm and 10-70 kg.cm/cm for samples of thickness 6.4 mm (according to ASTM D256).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compounds exhibit tensile strength at yield in the range: 150-250 kg/cm2 when tested according to ASTM D638.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the compounds exhibit flexural strength in the range: 200-400 kg/cm2 and flexural modulus in the range: 9,000-19,000 kg/cm2 when tested according to ASTM D790.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the compounds exhibit heat deflection temperature in the range of 60 to 110°C when tested under a stress of 4.6 kgf. and 40 to 70°C under 18.2 kgf. according to ASTM D648.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, EPDM was used in the range of up to 0-25 wt % with calcium carbonate, talc or mica in the range of 0-25 wt%.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the filler particle average size was in the range: 5-30 microns.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the filler particles were surface treated with an organic coupling agent so as to promote adhesion between base polymer and the filler particles.<br>
4<br><br>
Preferably, the base polymer is a polypropylne copolymer (PPCP), more preferably, a block or random copolymer of propylene and ethylene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said extrusion is carried out in the presence of at least  one  conventional  compatibilizer/interfacial  agent.   Preferably,   said   conventional compatibilizer/interfacial agent comprises a copolymer with at least one monomer as acrylonitrile present in a concentration of 0-10 wt %. Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention was carried out with a polyolefin polymer, preferably with polypropylene copolymer obtained in the form of granules that are stabilized with adequate doses of stabilizers and antioxidants. The granules are pre-dried at 80±5°C for two hours. EPDM either in neat granules form or in the form of master batch granules, separately prepared with another suitable polyolefin, was also dried, separately, at 80±5°C for 2 hours. Similarly, a filler, such as calcium carbonate, talc or mica, preferably with an average particle size in the range: 5-30 microns was also dried at 80±5°C for 2 hours.<br>
Processing conditions of the extruder, (such as the temperature profile, the screw speed), the polymer/polymers mix, feed rate and the screw design profoundly influence the blends' morphology and the blends' properties. A judicious selection of these processing conditions would help in getting optimum results. Apart from these, the blends' properties are sensitive to even the sequence of mixing the ingredients in the extruder. The extrudate coming out of the extruder can be in the form of one, two or more strands. These continuous extrudates are cooled in a trough of circulating water and are granulated after drying.<br>
The twin-screw extruder is designed with a preferred screw profile that would favor an intense mixing of the ingredients in the extruder.<br>
In the present invention, the granules from the extruded compounds are made free from moisture and are used to injection mold into ASTM standard test specimens for evaluating various properties, primarily, tensile, flexural, Izod impact, heat deflection temperature etc. Granules, free from moisture, are also used to measure melt flow index, crystallization kinetics (using differential scanning calorimeter), filler content (using thermo gravimetric analyzer) dispersion of EPDM and filler (using polarized optical microscope) etc.<br>
Injection molding is one process through which the prepared composite granules are shaped into a desired object or standard specimens for evaluating various properties as well as micro-structural details, such as filler dispersion, EPDM dispersion, filler-matrix interaction etc. In the present invention, compounds prepared in the preferred extruder are injection molded into standard ASTM test specimens.<br>
Injection    molding    is    carried    out    using    computer    controlled    injection<br>
5<br><br>
molding machine (FRK-85, Klockner-Windsor) with temperature profile in the range: 140-200°C, injection pressure in the range: 75-125 kg/cm2 {in six different stages), injection time in the range: 2.3-40 sec, (applied in six different stages) with screw speed, (in two stages), in the range: 90-105 r.p.m. The standard test specimens, thus obtained were tested following the ASTM standard test methods.<br>
The   present   invention   will   now   be   described   in   terms   of  the   preferred embodiments, with reference to the following non-limiting examples. However, it is to be understood that various alterations and modifications will be possible within the scope and spirit of the present invention. Example-1:<br>
Pre-dried granules of the preferred polyolefin copolymer, viz., polypropylene copolymer were mixed with 5 wt % of dehumidified filler, CaCC&gt;3 and the homogeneous mixture was divided into two equal parts. To one part dried EPDM was added by 10 wt % and the mixture was extruded in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder with a suitable screw design. The extrusion was carried out at 200°C with screw rotating at 40 r.p.m. The extrudate compound strand (referred to as Compound A) coming out of the extruder was dipped in a trough of circulating water. Subsequently, the strand was dried and granulated.<br>
The remaining part of the polymer premix (from the above) was further mixed with<br>
15 wt% of dry EPDM and extruded while all the other conditions were maintained as<br>
indicated above. The prepared compound (referred to as Compound B) was dried and<br>
granulated as above. The compound granules in both these cases were molded using an<br>
injection molding machine. The compounds were processed under identical conditions as<br>
given in Table-I.<br>
