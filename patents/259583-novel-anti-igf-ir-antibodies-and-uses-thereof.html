				<td>NOVEL ANTI-IGF-IR ANTIBODIES AND USES THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to novel antibodies capable of binding specifically to the human insulin-like growth factor I receptor IGF-IR and/or capable of specifically inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of said IGF-IR, especially monoclonal antibodies of murine, chimeric and humanized origin, as well as the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences coding for these antibodies. The invention likewise comprises the use of these antibodies as a medicament for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of cancers overexpressing IGF-IR or any pathology connected with the overexpression of said receptor as well as hi processes or kits for diagnosis of illnesses connected with the overexpression of the IGF-IR. The invention finally comprises products and/or compositions comprising such antibodies in combination with anti-EGFR antibodies and/or anti-VEGF antibodies and/or antibodies directed against other growth factors involved in tumor progression or metastasis and/or compounds and/or anti-cancer agents or agents conjugated with toxins and their use for the prevention and/or the treatment of certain cancers.<br>
The insulin-like growth factor I receptor called IGF-IR is a well described receptor with tyrosine kinase activity having 70% homology with the insulin receptor IR. IGF-IR is a glycoprotein of molecular weight approximately 350,000.<br>
It is a hetero-tetrameric receptor of which each half-linked by disulfide bridges is composed of an extracellular a-subunit and of a transmembrane /3-subunit. IGF-IR binds IGF1 and IGF2 with a very high affinity (Kd #1 nM) but is equally capable of binding to insulin with an affinity 100 to 1000 times less. Conversely, the IR binds insulin with a very high affinity although the IGFs only bind to the insulin receptor with a 100 times lower affinity. The tyrosine kinase domain of IGF-IR and of IR has a very high sequence homology although the zones of weaker homology respectively concern the cysteine-rich region situated on the a-subunit and the C-terminal part of the /3-subunit. The sequence differences observed hi the a-subunit are situated in the binding zone of the ligands and are therefore at the origin of the relative affinities of IGF-IR and of IR for the IGFs and insulin respectively. The differences in the C-terminal part of the /3-subunit result in a divergence in the signalling pathways of the two receptors; IGF-IR mediating mitogenic, differentiation and anti-apoptosis effects, while the activation of the IR<br><br>
principally involves effects at the level of the metabolic pathways (Baserga et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1332:F105-126, 1997; Baserga R., Exp. Cell. Res., 253:1-6, 1999).<br>
The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase proteins are activated by the binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor. The activation of the kinases in its turn involves the stimulation of different intra-cellular substrates, including IRS-1, IRS-2, She and Grb 10 (Peruzzi F. et al., J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., 125:166-173, 1999). The two major substrates of IGF-IR are IRS and She which mediate, by the activation of numerous effectors downstream, the majority of the growth and differentiation effects connected with the attachment of the IGFs to this receptor. The availability of substrates can consequently dictate the final biological effect connected with the activation of the IGF-IR. When IRS-1 predominates, the cells tend to proliferate and to transform. When She dominates, the cells tend to differentiate (Valentinis B. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:12423-12430, 1999). It seems that the route principally involved for the effects of protection against apoptosis is the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) route (Frisco M. et al., Horm. Metab. Res., 31:80-89, 1999; Peruzzi F. et al., J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., 125:166-173,1999).<br>
The role of the IGF system in carcinogenesis has become the subject of intensive research in the last ten years. This interest followed the discovery of the fact that in addition to its mitogenic and antiapoptosis properties, IGF-IR seems to be required for the establishment and the maintenance of a transformed phenotype. In fact, it has been well established that an overexpression or a constitutive activation of IGF-IR leads, in a great variety of cells, to a growth of the cells independent of the support in media devoid of fetal calf serum, and to the formation of tumors in nude mice. This in itself is not a unique property since a great variety of products of overexpressed genes can transform cells, including a good number of receptors of growth factors. However, the crucial discovery which has clearly demonstrated the major role played by IGF-IR in the transformation has been the demonstration that the R- cells, in which the gene coding for IGF-IR has been inactivated, are totally refractory to transformation by different agents which are usually capable of transforming the cells, such as the E5 protein of bovine papilloma virus, an overexpression of EGFR or of PDGFR, the T antigen of SV 40, activated ras or the combination of these two last factors (Sell C. et<br><br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 90:11217-11221, 1993; Sell C. et al, Mol. Cell. Biol., 14:3604-3612, 1994; Morrione A. J., Virol., 69:5300-5303, 1995; Coppola D. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 14:4588-4595, 1994; DeAngelis T. et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 164:214-221,1995).<br>
IGF-IR is expressed in a great variety of tumors and of tumor lines and the IGFs amplify the tumor growth via their attachment to IGF-IR. Other arguments in favor of the role of IGF-IR in carcinogenesis come from studies using murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor or using negative dominants of IGF-IR. In effect, murine monoclonal antibodies directed against IGF-IR inhibit the proliferation of numerous cell lines hi culture and the growth of tumor cells in vivo (Arteaga C. et al., Cancer Res., 49:6237-6241, 1989; Li et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com., 196:92-98, 1993; Zia F. et al., J. Cell. Biol., 24:269-275, 1996; Scotlandi K. et al., Cancer Res., 58:4127-4131,1998). It has likewise been shown in the works of Jiang et al. (Oncogene, 18:6071-6077,1999) that a negative dominant of IGF-IR is capable of inhibiting tumor proliferation.<br>
Cancer pathologies are characterized by an uncontrolled cellular growth. In several cancer, growth factors are specifically binding with their receptors and then transmit growth, transformation and/or survival signals to the tumoral cell. The growth factor receptors over-expression at the tumoral cell surface is largely described (Salomon D.S. et al., Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol., 1995, 19:183; Burrow S. et al., J. Surg. Oncol., 1998, 69:21; Hakam A. et al., Hum. Pathol., 1999, 30:1128; Railo M.J. et al., Eur. J. Cancer, 1994, 30:307; Happerfield L.C. et al., J. Pathol., 1997, 183:412). This over-expression, or abnormal activation, leading to a direct perturbation of cellular growth regulation mechanisms, can also affect the cell sensibility to induced apoptose by classical chemotherapies or radiotherapies.<br>
During last few years, it has been shown that the targeting of growth factor receptors, like EGFR or Her2/neu over-expressed on the tumoral cell surface, with respectively humanized (herceptin®) or chimeric (C225) antibodies results in an significant inhibition of the tumoral growth in patients and in a significant increase of the efficacity of classical chemotherapy treatments (Carter P., Nature Rev. Cancer, 2001, 1(2):118; Hortobagyi G. N., Semin. Oncol., 2001, 28:43; Herbst R. S. et al., Semin. Oncol., 2002, 29:27). Other receptors like IGF-IR or VEGF-R (for vascular<br><br>
endothelial growth factor receptor) have been identified as potential target in several preclinical studies.<br>
More particularly, IGF-IR is part of the tyrosine kinase receptors. It shows a high homology with the Insulin receptor (IR) which exist under two isoforms A and B.<br>
Sequences of IR, isoforms A and B, are registered under Accession Numbers X02160 and M10051, respectively, in the NCBI Genbank. Other data, without limitations, relating to IR are incorporated herein by references (Vinten et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:249-252; Belfiore et al., 2002, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277:39684-39695; Dumesic et al., 2004, The Journal of Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, 89(7):3561-3566).<br>
The IGF-IR and IR are tetrameric glycoproteins composed of two extracellular a- and two transmembrane fj-subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Each oc-subunit, containing the ligand-binding site is approximately 130- to 135-kDa, whereas each P-subunit containing the tyrosine kinase domain is approximately 90- to 95- kDa. These receptors share more than 50% overall amino acid sequence similarity and 84% similarity in the tyrosine kinase domain. After ligand binding, phosphorylated receptors recruit and phosphorylate docking proteins, including the insulin receptor substrate-1 protein family (IRS1), Gabl and She (Avruch, 1998, Mol.Cell. Biochem., 182, 31-48; Roth et al., 1988, Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 53, 537-543; White, 1998, Mol. Cell. Biochem., 182, 3-11; Laviola et al., 1997, J. Clin. Invest. 99, 830-837; Cheatham et al., 1995, Endocr. Rev. 16,117-142), leading to the activation of different intracellular mediators. Although both the IR and IGF-IR similarly activate major signalling pathways, differences exist in the recruitment of certain docking proteins and intracellular mediators between both receptors (Sasaoka et al., 1996, Endocrinology 137, 4427-4434; Nakae et al., 2001, Endocr. Rev. 22, 818-835; Duponit and Le Roith 2001, Horm. Res. 55, Suppl. 2, 22-26; Koval et al., 1998, Biochem. J. 330, 923-932). These differences are the basis for the predominant metabolic effects elicited by IR activation and the predominant mitogenic, transforming and anti-apoptotic effects elicited by IGF-IR activation (De Meyts et al., 1995, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 766, 388-401; Singh et al., 2000, Frisco et al., 1999, Horm. Metab. Res. 31, 80-89; Kido et al. 2001, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 86, 972-979). Insulin binds with high affinity to the<br><br>
IR (100-fold higher than to the IGF-IR), whereas insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2) bind to the IGF-IR with 100-fold higher affinity than to the IR.<br>
The human IR exists in two isoforms, IR-A and DR.-B, generated by alternative splicing of the IR gene that either excludes or includes 12 amino acid residues encoded by a small exon (exon 11) at the carboxy-terminus of the IR a-subunit. The relative abundance of IR isoforms is regulated by tissue specific and unknown factors (MoHer et al., 1989, Mol. Endocrinol., 3, 1263-1269; Mosthaf et al., 1990, EMBO J., 9, 2409-2413). IR-B is the predominant IR isoform in normal adult tissues (adipose tissue, liver and muscle) that are major target tissues for the metabolic effects of insulin (Moller et al., 1989; Mosthaf et al., 1990). IR-A is the predominant isoform in fetal tissues and mediates fetal growth in response to IGF2 (Frasca et al., 1999, Mol. Cell. Biol., 19, 3278-3288), as also suggested by genetic studies carried out in transgenic mice (DeChiara et al., 1990, Nature 345, 78-80; Louvi et al., 1997, Dev. Biol. 189, 33-48). Moreover, when cells transform and become malignant, dedifferentiation is often associated with an increased IR-A relative abundance (Pandini et al., 2002, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 277, N° 42, pp3 9684-39695).<br>
Given the high degree of homolqgy, the insulin and IGF-I half-receptors (composed of one a- and one p-subunit) can heterodimerize, leading to the formation of insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors (Hybrid-R) (Soos et al., 1990, Biochem J., 270, 383-390; Kasuya et al., 1993, Biochemistry 32, 13531-13536; Seely et al., 1995, Endocrinology 136,1635-1641; Bailyes et al., 1997, Biochem J. 327,209-215).<br>
Both IR isoforms are equally able to form hybrids with IGF-IR. Hybrid-R, however, have different functional characteristics. Hybrid-RsB has reduced affinity for IGF1 and especially for IGF2. In contrast, Hybrid-RsA has a high affinity for IGF1 and bind also IGF2 and insulin at a physiological concentration range. The expression of Hybrid-RsA up-regulates the IGF system by two different mechanisms i) binding (with high affinity) and activation by both IGF1 and IGF2 (which do not occur with the Hybrid-RsB), ii) activation of the IGF-IR pathway after insulin binding. Insulin binding to Hybrid-RsA phosphorylates the IGF-IR p-subunit and activates an IGF-IR-specific substrate (CrkD) so that Hybrid-RsA shifts insulin to IGF-IR signaling (Pandini et al., 2002).<br><br>
In several tissues, like liver, spleen or placenta, Hybrid-R are more represented than IGF-IR (Bailyes et al., 1997). As tumor tissues overexpress, or present an abnormal activation, both IGF-IR and IR-A (Frasca et al., 1999; Sciacca et al., 1999, Oncogene 18, 2471-2479; Vella et al., 2001, Mol. Pathol., 54,121-124), Hybrid-RsA may also be overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies, including thyroid and breast cancers providing a selective growth advantage to malignant cells able to respond by a type IGF-IR signalisation following a stimulation by IGF1 and/or IGF2 but also by insulin at physiological concentrations (Bailyes et al., 1997; Pandini et al., 1999, Clin. Cancer Res., 5, 1935-1944; Belfiore et al., 1999, Biochimie (Paris) 81, 403-407; Frasca et al. 1999, Sciacca et al., 1999; Vella et al., 2001).<br>
The realisation of such "therapeutic tools" able to block in the same time the two receptors is of particular interest as they will allow to avoid the escape phenomena mediated by the expression, or abnormal activation, in a same tumor of IGF-IR and hybrid-R.<br>
Regarding the increasing interest on IGF-IR and, more particularly, monoclonal antibodies able to bind to, or inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of, IGF-IR, the applicants have akeady developed and characterized a humanized monoclonal antibody called 7C10 or h7C!0 (coded F50035). An international patent application PCT/FR 03/00178 relating to this antibody and its uses have been filed and published on 24 July 2003 under the publication number WO 03/059951. The content of this patent application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The object of the present invention is to be able to have available other murine monoclonal antibodies, preferably chimerized or humanized antibodies, which will recognize IGF-IR specifically and with great affinity. These antibodies will interact little or not at all with the IR. Their attachment will be able to inhibit m vitro the growth of tumors expressing IGF-IR by interacting principally with the signal transduction pathways activated during IGF1/IGF-IR and IGF2/IGF-IR interactions. These antibodies will be able to be active in vivo on all the types of tumors expressing IGF-IR including estrogen-dependent tumors of the breast and tumors of the prostate.<br>
The present invention also allows to jointly block the hybrid-R and IGF-IR activity by generating a compound, and more particularly antibodies, of high affinity<br><br>
able to bind to said two receptors and also to block their activation by IGF1, IGF2 or Insulin.<br>
The present invention also deals with the use of isolated antibodies according to the present invention, or a fragment thereof, said antibodies or fragment being able to bind to i) human IGF-IR ,and/or to inhibit the binding of its native ligands, preferably IGF1 and/or IGF2, and/or also able to inhibit specifically the tyrosine kinase activity of said IGF-IR and/or ii) hybrid-R, and/or to inhibit the binding of its native ligands, preferably IGF1, IGF2 and/or Insulin, and/or also able to specifically inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of said hybrid-R.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, said antibodies are used for cancer therapy, more particularly breast cancer therapy.<br>
Actually, it is known that breast tumoral cells specifically present on their surface IGF-IR but also a great number of Insulin receptor and, as a consequence, a great number of Hybrid-R (Frasca et al., 1999; Sciacca et al., 1999; Vella et aL, 2001).<br>
More particularly, the present invention concerns four different anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibodies.<br>
In a first aspect, a subject of the present invention is an isolated antibody, or one of its functional fragments, said antibody or one of its said fragments being capable of binding specifically to the human insulin-like growth factor I receptor and, if necessary, preferably moreover capable of inhibiting the natural attachment of the ligands IGF1 and/or IGF2 of IGF-IR and/or capable of specifically inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of said IGF-IR, characterized in that it comprises a light chain comprising at least one complementarity determining region CDR chosen from the CDRs of amino acid sequence SEQ ED Nos. 1,2 and 3, or at least one CDR whose sequence has at least 80%, preferably 85%, 90%, 95% and 98% identity, after optimum alignment, with the sequence SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3, or in that it comprises a heavy chain comprising at least one CDR chosen from the CDRs of amino acid sequence SEQ ID Nos. 4, 5 and 6, or at least one CDR whose sequence has at least 80%, preferably 85%, 90%, 95% and 98% identity, after optimum alignment, with the sequence SEQ ID No. 4,5 and 6.<br>
In the present specification and corresponding exemples, this antibody will be referred as 13F5. .<br><br>
In the present description, the terms "to bind" and "to attach" have the same meaning and are inter-changeable.<br>
In the present description, the terms polypeptides, polypeptide sequences, peptides and proteins attached to antibody compounds or to their sequence are interchangeable.<br>
It must be understood here that the invention does not relate to the antibodies in natural form, that is to say they are not in their natural environment but that they have been able to be isolated or obtained by purification from natural sources, or else obtained by genetic recombination, or by chemical synthesis, and that they can then contain unnatural amino acids as will be described further on.<br>
By CDR regions or CDR(s), it is intended to indicate the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulins as defined by Kabat et al. (Kabat et al., Sequences of proteins of immunological interest, 5th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, 1991, and later editions). Three heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs exist. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognizes.<br>
By "percentage of identity" between two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences in the sense of the present invention, it is intended to indicate a percentage of nucleotides or of identical amino acid residues between the two sequences to be compared, obtained after the best alignment (optimum alignment), this percentage being purely statistical and the differences between the two sequences being distributed randomly and over their entire length. The comparisons of sequences between two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences are traditionally carried out by comparing these sequences after having aligned them in an optimum manner, said comparison being able to be carried out by segment or by "comparison window". The optimum alignment of the sequences for the comparison can be carried out, in addition to manually, by means of the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) [Ad. App. Math. 2:482], by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch (1970) [J. Mol. Biol. 48:443], by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444), by means of computer software using<br><br>
these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI, or else by BLAST N or BLAST P comparison software).<br>
The percentage of identity between two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences is determined by comparing these two sequences aligned ha an optimum manner and in which the nucleic acid or amino acid sequence to be compared can comprise additions or deletions with respect to the reference sequence for an optimum alignment between these two sequences. The percentage of identity is calculated by determining the number of identical positions for which the nucleotide or the amino acid residue is identical between the two sequences, by dividing this number of identical positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window and by multiplying the result obtained by 100 hi order to obtain the percentage of identity between these two sequences.<br>
For example, it is possible to use the BLAST program, "BLAST 2 sequences" (Tatusova et al., "Blast 2 sequences - a new tool for comparing protein and nucleotide sequences", FEMS Microbiol Lett. 174:247-250) available on the site http://www.ncbi.nhn.nih.gov/ gorf/bl2.html; the parameters used being those given by default (in particular for the parameters "open gap penalty": 5, and "extension gap penalty": 2; the matrix chosen being, for example, the matrix "BLOSUM 62" proposed by the program), the percentage of identity between the two sequences to be compared being calculated directly by the program.<br>
By amino acid sequence having at least 80%, preferably 85%, 90%, 95% and 98% identity with a reference amino acid sequence, those having, with respect to the reference sequence, certain modifications, in particular a deletion, addition or substitution of at least one amino acid, a truncation or an elongation are preferred. Li the case of a substitution of one or more consecutive or nonconsecutive amino acid(s), the substitutions are preferred in which the substituted amino acids are replaced by "equivalent" amino acids. The expression "equivalent amino acids" is aimed here at indicating any amino acid capable of being substituted with one of the amino acids of the base structure without, however, essentially modifying the biological activities of the corresponding antibodies and such as will be defined later, especially in the examples. These equivalent ammo acids can be determined either by relying on their<br><br>
structural homology with the amino acids which they replace, or on results of comparative trials of biological activity between the different antibodies capable of being carried out.<br>
By way of example, mention is made of the possibilities of substitution capable of being carried out without resulting in a profound modification of the biological activity of the corresponding modified antibody. It is thus possible to replace leucine by valine or isoleucine, aspartic acid by glutamic acid, glutamine by asparagine, argmine by lysine, etc., the reverse substitutions being naturally envisageable under the same conditions.<br>

The antibodies according to the present invention, i.e. 13F5, 12D5,2D10 and 21E3 are preferably specific monoclonal antibodies, especially of murine, chimeric or humanized origin, which can be obtained according to the standard methods well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In general, for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies or their functional fragments, especially of murine origin, it is possible to refer to techniques which are described in particular in the manual "Antibodies" (Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor NY, pp. 726, 1988) or to the technique of preparation from hybridomas described by Kohler and Milstein (Nature, 256:495-497,1975).<br>
The monoclonal antibodies according to the invention can be obtained, for example, from an animal cell immunized against the IGF-IR, or one of its fragments containing the epitope specifically recognized by said monoclonal antibodies according to the invention. Said IGF-IR, or one of its said fragments, can especially be produced according to the usual working methods, by genetic recombination starting with a nucleic acid sequence contained in the cDNA sequence coding for the IGF-IR or by peptide synthesis starting from a sequence of amino acids comprised in- the peptide sequence of the IGF-IR.<br><br>
The monoclonal antibodies according to the invention can, for example, be purified on an affinity column on which the IGF-IR or one of its fragments containing the epitope specifically recognized by said monoclonal antibodies according to the invention has previously been immobilized. More particularly, said monoclonal antibodies can be purified by chromatography on protein A and/or G, followed or not followed by ion-exchange chromatography aimed at eliminating the residual protein contaminants as well as the DNA and the LPS, in itself followed or not followed by exclusion chromatography on Sepharose gel in order to eliminate the potential aggregates due to the presence of dimers or of other multimers. In an even more preferred manner, the whole of these techniques can be used simultaneously or successively.<br>
Chimeric or humanized antibodies are likewise included in antibodies according to the present invention.<br>
By chimeric antibody, it is intended to indicate an antibody which contains a natural variable (light chain and heavy chain) region derived from an antibody of a given species in combination with the light chain and heavy chain constant regions of an antibody of a species heterologous to said given species.<br>
The antibodies or their fragments of chimeric type according to the invention can be prepared by using the techniques of genetic recombination. For example, the chimeric antibody can be produced by cloning a recombinant DNA containing a promoter and a sequence coding for the variable region of a non-human, especially murine, monoclonal antibody according to the invention and a sequence coding for the constant region of human antibody. A chimeric antibody of the invention encoded by such a recombinant gene will be, for example, a mouse-man chimera, the specificity of this antibody being determined by the variable region derived from the murine DNA and its isotype determined by the constant region derived from the human DNA. For the methods of preparation of chimeric antibodies, it is possible, for example, to refer to the document Verhoeyn et al. (BioEssays, 8:74,1988).<br>
By humanized antibody, it is intended to indicate an antibody which contains CDR regions derived from an antibody of nonhuman origin, the other parts of the antibody molecule being derived from one (or from several) human antibodies. Moreover, some of the residues of the segments of the skeleton (called FR) can be<br><br>
modified in order to conserve the affinity of the binding (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525, 1986; Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536, 1988; Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327,1988).<br>
The humanized antibodies according to the invention or their fragments can be prepared by techniques known to the person skilled in the art (such as, for example, those described in the documents Singer et al., J. Irnmun. 150:2844-2857, 1992; Mountain et al., Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev., 10: 1-142, 1992; or Bebbington et al, Bio/Technology, 10:169-175, 1992). Such humanized antibodies according to the invention are preferred for their use in in vitro diagnostic methods, or in vivo prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment.<br>
By functional fragment of an antibody according to the invention, it is intended to indicate in particular an antibody fragment, such as Fv, scFv (sc for single chain), Fab, F(ab')2, Fab', scFv-Fc fragments or diabodies, or any fragment of which the half-life time would have been increased by chemical modification, such as the addition of poly(alkylene) glycol such as poly(ethylene) glycol ("PEGylation") (pegylated fragments called Fv-PEG, scFv-PEG, Fab-PEG, F(ab')2-PEG or Fab'-PEG) ("PEG" for Poly(Ethylene) Glycol), or by incorporation in a liposome, said fragments having at least one of the characteristic CDRs of sequence SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 6, 7 to 12 or 13 to 18 according to the invention, and, especially, in that it is capable of exerting in a general manner an even partial activity of the antibody from which it is descended, such as in particular the capacity to recognize and to bind to the IGF-IR, and, if necessary, to inhibit the activity of the IGF-IR.<br>
Preferably, said functional fragments will be constituted or will comprise a partial sequence of the heavy or light variable chain of the antibody from which they are derived, said partial sequence being sufficient to retain the same specificity of binding as the antibody from which it is descended and a sufficient affinity, preferably at least equal to 1/100, in a more preferred manner to at least 1/10, of that of the antibody from which it is descended, with respect to the IGF-IR. Such a functional fragment will contain at the minimum 5 amino acids, preferably 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 consecutive amino acids of the sequence of the antibody from which it is descended.<br>
Preferably, these functional fragments will be fragments of Fv, scFv, Fab, F(ab')2, F(ab'), scFv-Fc type or diabodies, which generally have the same specificity of<br><br>
binding as the antibody from which they are descended. According to the present invention, antibody fragments of the invention can be obtained starting from antibodies such as described above by methods such as digestion by enzymes, such as pepsin or papain and/or by cleavage of the disulfide bridges by chemical reduction. In another manner, the antibody fragments comprised in the present invention can be obtained by techniques of genetic recombination likewise well known to the person skilled in the art or else by peptide synthesis by means of, for example, automatic peptide synthesizers such as those supplied by the company Applied Biosystems, etc..<br>

According to a novel aspect, the present invention relates to an isolated nucleic acid, characterized in that it is chosen from the following nucleic acids:<br>
a)	a nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, coding for an antibody, or one of its<br>
functional fragments, according to the invention;<br>
b)	a complementary nucleic acid of a nucleic acid such as defined in a).<br>
By nucleic acid, nucleic or nucleic acid sequence, polynucleotide, oligonucleotide, polynucleotide sequence, nucleotide sequence, terms which will be employed indifferently in the present invention, it is intended to indicate a precise linkage of nucleotides, which are modified or unmodified, allowing a fragment or a region of a nucleic acid to be defined, containing or not containing unnatural nucleotides, and being able to correspond just as well to a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA as to the transcription products of said DMAs.<br>
It must also be understood here that the present invention does not concern the nucleotide sequences in their natural chromosomal environment, that is to say in the natural state. It concerns sequences which have been isolated and/or purified, that is to say that they have been selected directly or indirectly, for example by copy, their environment having been at least partially modified. It is thus likewise intended to indicate here the isolated nucleic acids obtained by genetic recombination by means, for example, of host cells or obtained by chemical synthesis.<br>
A hybridization under conditions of high stringency signifies that the temperature conditions and ionic strength conditions are chosen in such a way that they allow the maintenance of the hybridization between two fragments of complementary DNA. By way of illustration, conditions of high stringency of the hybridization step for the purposes of defining the polynucleotide fragments described above are advantageously the following.<br>
The DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization is carried out in two steps: (1) prehybridization at 42°C for 3 hours in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) containing 5 x SSC (1 x SSC corresponds to a 0.15 M NaCl + 0.015 M sodium citrate solution), 50%<br><br>
of formamide, 7% of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 x Denhardt's, 5% of dextran sulfate and 1% of salmon sperm DNA; (2) actual hybridization for 20 hours at a temperature dependent on the size of the probe (i.e.: 42°C, for a probe size &gt; 100 nucleotides) followed by 2 washes of 20 minutes at 20°C in 2 x SSC + 2% of SDS, 1 wash of 20 minutes at 20°C in 0.1 x SSC + 0.1% of SDS. The last wash is carried out in 0.1 x SSC + 0.1% of SDS for 30 minutes at 60°C for a probe size &gt; 100 nucleotides. The hybridization conditions of high stringency described above for a polynucleotide of defined size can be adapted by the person skilled in the art for oligonucleotides of greater or smaller size, according to the teaching of Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor).<br>
The invention likewise relates to a vector comprising a nucleic acid according to the present invention.<br>
The invention aims especially at cloning and/or expression vectors which contain a nucleotide sequence according to the invention.<br>
The vectors according to the invention preferably contain elements which allow the expression and/or the secretion of the nucleotide sequences in a determined host cell. The vector must therefore contain a promoter, signals of initiation and termination of translation, as well as appropriate regions of regulation of transcription. It must be able to be maintained in a stable manner in the host cell and can optionally have particular signals which specify the secretion of the translated protein. These different elements are chosen and optimized by the person skilled in the art as a function of the host cell used. To this effect, the nucleotide sequences according to the invention can be inserted into autonomous replication vectors in the chosen host, or be integrative vectors of the chosen host.<br>
Such vectors are prepared by methods currently used by the person skilled in the art, and the resulting clones can be introduced into an appropriate host by standard methods, such as lipofection, electroporation, thermal shock, or chemical methods.<br>
The vectors according to the invention are, for example, vectors of plasmidic or viral origin. They are useful for transforming host cells in order to clone or to express the nucleotide sequences according to the invention.<br>
The invention likewise comprises the host cells transformed by or comprising a vector according to the invention.<br><br>
The host cell can be chosen from prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems, for example bacterial cells but likewise yeast cells or animal cells, in particular mammalian cells. It is likewise possible to use insect cells or plant cells.<br>

according to the invention; and<br>
b)	the recovery of said antibodies, or one of their functional fragments, thus<br>
produced starting from the culture medium or said cultured cells.<br>
The cells transformed according to the invention can be used in processes for preparation of recombinant polypeptides according to the invention. The processes for preparation of a polypeptide according to the invention in recombinant form, characterized in that they employ a vector and/or a cell transformed by a vector according to the invention, are themselves comprised in the present invention. Preferably, a cell transformed by a vector according to the invention is cultured under conditions which allow the expression of said polypeptide and said recombinant peptide is recovered.<br>
As has been said, the host cell can be chosen from prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. In particular, it is possible to identify nucleotide sequences according to the invention, facilitating secretion in such a prokaryotic or eukaryotic system. A vector according to the invention carrying such a sequence can therefore advantageously be used for the production of recombinant proteins, intended to be secreted. In effect, the purification of these recombinant proteins of interest will be facilitated by the fact that they are present in the supernatant of the cell culture rather than in the interior of the host cells.<br>
It is likewise possible to prepare the polypeptides according to the invention by chemical synthesis. Such a preparation process is likewise a subject of the invention. The person'skilled in the art knows the processes of chemical synthesis, for example the techniques employing solid phases (see especially Steward et al., 1984, Solid phase<br><br>
peptide synthesis, Pierce Chem. Company, Rockford, 111, 2nd ed.) or techniques using partial solid phases, by condensation of fragments or by a classical synthesis in solution. The polypeptides obtained by chemical synthesis and being able to contain corresponding unnatural amino acids are likewise comprised in the invention.<br>

In a general fashion, the composition according to the invention considerably increases the efficacy of the treatment of cancer. In other words, the therapeutic effect of the anti-IGF-IR antibodies according to the invention is potentiated in an unexpected manner by the administration of a cytotoxic agent. Another major subsequent advantage<br><br>
produced by a composition according to the invention concerns the possibility of using lower efficacious doses of active principle, which allows the risks of appearance of secondary effects to be avoided or to be reduced, in particular the effects of the cytotoxic agent.<br>
In addition, this composition according to the invention would allow the expected therapeutic effect to be attained more rapidly.<br>

In order to facilitate the coupling between said cytotoxic agent and said antibody according to the invention, it is especially possible to introduce spacer molecules between the two compounds to be coupled, such as poly(alkylene) glycols like polyethylene glycol, or else amino acids, or, in another embodiment, to use active derivatives of said cytotoxic agents into which would have been introduced functions capable of reacting with said antibody according to the invention. These coupling techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art and will not be expanded upon in the present description.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, said inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors for IGF-I is selected from the group consisting of derived natural agents,<br><br>
dianilinophthalimides, pyrazolo- or pyrrolopyridopyrirnidines or else quinazilines. Such inhibitory agents are well known to the person skilled in the art and described in the literature (Ciardiello F., Drugs 2000, Suppl. 1,25-32).<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the composition such as described above can likewise comprise another antibody compound directed against the extracellular domain of the HER2/neu receptor, as a combination product for simultaneous, separate or sequential use, intended for the prevention and for the treatment of cancer, especially the cancers overexpressing said HER2/neu receptor and the receptor IGF-IR, such as especially cancer of the breast.<br>
Reference can be made especially to the publications of Albanell et al. (J, of the National Cancer Institute, 93(24): 1830-1831, 2001) and of Lu et al. (J. of the National Cancer Institute, 93(24):1852-1857, 2001) justifying the unexpected interest in combining an anti-HER2/neu antibody with an anti-IGF-IR antibody according to the present invention.<br>
In a particular manner, said anti-HER2/neu antibody of the composition according to the invention is the antibody called Trastuzumab (also called Herceptin).<br>
The invention relates, in another aspect, to a composition characterized in that one, at least, of said antibodies, or one of their functional fragments, is conjugated with a cell toxin and/or a radioelement.<br>
Preferably, said toxin or said radioelement is capable of inhibiting at least one cell activity of cells expressing the IGF-IR, in a more preferred manner capable of preventing the growth or the proliferation of said cell, especially of totally inactivating said cell.<br>
Preferably also, said toxin is an enterobacterial toxin, especially Pseudomonas<br>
exotoxinA.	'<br>
The radioelements (or radioisotopes) preferably conjugated to the antibodies employed for the therapy are radioisotopes which emit 'gamma rays and preferably iodine131, yttrium90, gold199, palladium100, copper67, bismuth217 and antimony211. The radioisotopes which emit beta and alpha rays can likewise be used for the therapy.<br>

Among the agents allowing binding in a chemical (covalent), electrostatic or noncovalent manner of all or part of the components of the conjugate, mention may particularly be made of benzoquinone, carbodiimide and more particularly EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride), dimaleimide, dithiobis-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), N-succinirnidyl S-acetyl thio-acetate (SATA), the bridging agents having one or more phenylazide groups reacting with the ultraviolets (U.V.) and preferably N-[-4-(azidosalicylamino)butyl]-3 '-(2'-pyridyldithio)-propionamide (APDP), N-succinimid-yl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), 6-hydrazino-nicotinamide (HYNIC).<br>
Another form of coupling, especially for the radioelements, can consist in the use of a bifunctional ion chelator.<br>
Among these chelates, it is possible to mention the chelates derived from EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or from DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) which have been developed for binding metals, especially radioactive metals, and immunoglobuUns. Thus, DTPA and its derivatives can be substituted by different groups on the carbon chain in order to increase the stability and the rigidity of the ligand-metal complex (Krejcarek et al., 1977; Brechbiel et al., 1991; Gansow, 1991; US patent 4,831,175).<br>
For example diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and its derivatives, which have been widely used in medicine and in biology for a long time either in their free form, or in the form of a complex with a metallic ion, have the remarkable characteristic of forming stable chelates with metallic ions and of being coupled with proteins of therapeutic or diagnostic interest such as antibodies for the development of radioimmunoconjugates in cancer therapy (Meases et al., 1984; Gansow et al., 1990).<br>

Exemple 1: Generation of monoclonal antibodies against IGF-1R<br>
Hybridomas were generated by fusion of splenocytes from BALB/c mice immunised with a soluble a2-p2 heterotetrameric recombinant human IGF-1R (R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, USA) and the SP2/0-Agl4 myeloma cell line. The resulting murine antibodies were first screened by ELISA and FACS analysis on MCF-7 cells. Then, a final screen on Sf9-IGF-lr versus Sf9-IR cells was performed to eliminate antibodies recognizing both IGF-1 and IR. The selected MAbs (positives in ELISA and recognizing the wild type receptor on MCF-7 cells) were produced as ascitic fluids and purified by protein A chromatography before testing either in vitro and/or in vivo as summarized in table 1.<br>
(TableRemvoed)<br>
 TABLE 1: Selection of anti-IGF-lR monoclonal antibodies<br>
Exemple 2: In vitro activity of anti-IGF-lR antibodies<br>
Method<br>
MCF-7 cells from ATCC were routinely cultured in phenol red free-RPMI medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Scotland, UK), 10% PCS (Invitrogen Corporation), 1% L-Glutamine (Invitrogen Corporation). MCF-7 cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 x 104 cells/well in serum-free medium. After 24 hours a dose range of IGFl from 1 to 50 ng/ml was added to the medium either in absence or in presence at a final concentration of 5 fig/ml of each antibody to be tested. After 3 days, cells were pulsed with 0.5 u€i of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for 16 hours. The magnitude of [3H]thymidme incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Results are expressed as a proliferative index (cpm of cells plus IGFl plus antibody / cpm of cells plus antibody alone).<br><br>
Results<br>
The in vitro evaluation was the first screening of Mabs in terms of mitogenic activity. For these assays, the generated antibodies, produced as ascitic fluids, were added to MCF-7 cells at the same time as IGFl and compared to the commercially available <xir3 mab to select antibodies at least as efficacious this latter antibody. the positive mabs described in table of previous reply are one giving proliferative indexes when cells were stimulated with highest dose igfl ng figure shows vitro activity four out strong inhibitors and have been considered a index for concentration non-neutralizing>15). It is interesting to notice that the 21E3 is the only Mab of IgG2 isotype.<br>
Example 3: In vivo activity of anti-IGF-lR antibodies<br>
Method<br>
DU145 cells from ATCC were routinely cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Scotland, UK), 10% FCS (Invitrogen Corporation), 1% L-Glutamine (Invitrogen Corporation). Cells were split two days before engraftment so that they were in exponential phase of growth. Two million DU145 cells were engrafted in PBS to Swiss nude mice. One day after implantation, animals were divided into groups of 6 mice. Mice were treated s.c. at the opposite of the tumor with 200 jig of each antibody to be tested, 3-times a week. The control group was either treated with a murine isotype control (EC2) in the first screening or PBS for subsequent screenings as it has been shown in the first experiment that no difference in tumor growth was observed between these 2 groups of mice. Tumor volume was measured once a week and calculated by the formula: 7t/6 X length X width X height.<br>
Results<br>
Three in vivo experiments were performed to test a panel of Mabs. Figures 2 and 3 show that 13F5, 2D10 and 6E5 significantly inhibit the in vivo growth of DU 145 cells. Statistical analysis (Mann and Whitney test) are shown in Table 2.<br>
