				<td>The present invention relates to a portable terminal device, in particular, to the structure of a case for containing functional parts of a portable phone and a PHS. Specifically, the present invention relates to a configuration for improving the mechanical strength and the rigidity of the case in light of a smaller size and a thinner shape of a portable terminal device main body so as to prevent damage of the functional parts caused by bend or twist.<br>
Recently, manufacturers of portable terminal devices, in particular, portable phobes and PHS are actively striving for new product developments to achieve a smaller size, a light weight and a thinner shape of the portable terminal devices. Accordmg to such a trend, the mechanical strength of the case for containing a portable terminal device main body tends to be vulnerable due to a thinner shape of the case and deterioration of the rigidity of the case.<br>
A lower case, a rib, a printed circuit board, and an electric parts or a motor which includes a motor cushion and motor body of US 6,333,459 correspond to a lower case, receiving ribs, a printed board, mounting parts of the present invention.<br>
In the above situation, US 6,333,459 fails to show a plurality of mounting parts mounted on said printed board and a lower case having a plurality of receiving ribs provided corresponding to arrangement positions of the mountmg parts, said plurality of receiving ribs supporting said plurality of mounting parts as recited in the present invention. Fig. 1 of US 6,333,459 shows the electric parts mounted on the printed circuit board is not supported by a protrusion of the lower case. Although Fig, 3 of US 6,333,459 shows the motor cushion supported by the ribs of the lower case, the motor cushion and the motor body are mounted on a second shield case, rather than the printed circuit board,<br><br>
Further, US 6,333,459 fails to show a battery case provided below the lower case for supporting deformation of said lower case as recited in the present invention. Fig. 1 and the corresponding description of US 6,333,459 shows that the battery is attached to a battery mounting flat portion formed on a back surface of the bottom casing. Therefore, US 6,333,459 fails to show the battery case.<br>
The configuration of a conventional portable terminal device, such as a portable phone and a PHS will be explained hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 6 to 10,<br>
FIG. 6 shows a configuration of the conventional -<br><br>
portable terrainal device. In FIG. 6, the portable terminal device is provided such that a printed board 12 with mounting parts 13 mounted thereon i s moan ted on alower case 11 from above, and further, a battery 14 is also mounted thereon from below. As is known conventionally. since a large number of small parts other than the mounting parts 13 are also mounted on the printed board 12 and wiring is also provided thereon, in accommodating the printed board 12 into the lower case 11, the printed board 12 is placed with a contacting surface disposed appropriately such that the printed board 12 is mounted horizontally, without contacting with the mounting parts 13.<br>
FIG. 7 is a side cross-sectiona 1 view showing the accommodatinq configuration of the portable terminal device accordingly provided.  In FIG, 7, which shows the relative arrangement relationship among the lower case 11, the printed board 12 and the mounting parts 13 apparently, the mounting parts 13 are not supported by the lower case 11.<br>
FIG. 8 is a side cross-sectional view showing the accommodating configuration of the portable terminal device, viewed from a side different from that of FIG. 7. Also in FIG. 8, which shows the relative positional relationship among the lower case 11, the printed board 12 and the mounting parts 13 apparently, it is observed that the mounting parts 13 are not supported by the lower case 11. Moreover, a contacting surface for supporting the printed board 12 at the center is also shown<br><br>
in FIG. 8.  It is observed that the contactinq surface is disposed such that the printed boa rd 12 is placed hori zcnta1ly, without contacting with the mount ir.g parts 13 as rr.entioned above . In FIG. 8, key buttons 16, an upper case 17, a bactery case IB and a battery cell 19 are also shown as components of the portable terminal device.<br>
FIG. 9 is a partial enlarged side cross-secr,ional view of E"lG. 8.  VJhat is important in FIG. 9 is the positional relationship among the lower case 11, the printed board 12 and the mounting parts 13.  FIG. 9 shows the positionai relationship before starting operation.<br>
FIG. 10 is a side cross-sectional view of the device of FIG. 9 in operation when the key button 16 is pressed frorri the arrow direction.  In FIG. 10, a problem is involved in rhat when the key button 16 is pressed, the printed board 12 is deformed, then the mounting parts 13 are deformed, and further, the mounting parts 13 come in contact with the lower case 11 so that the lower case 11 is deformed as well.  Furthermore, a problem arises in that the battery case 18 is deformed according to the deformation of the lower case 11.<br>
FIG. 10 shows the deformation amount B of the printed board 12 according to the press of the key button 16.  If the deformation amount is less than this, the above-mentioned deformation problem is not arisen.  However, in the current circumstances wherein a thinner shape of the case and the<br><br>
riqidity decline of the case results in vulnerability m terirs of the mechanical strength according tc ::he trend of a smaller size, a light weight and a thinner shape as mentione"i above, a problem is involved in that the deformation arriount. or the conventitinal configuration exceeds the tolerable range.<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned conventional problems and to provide a cortable terminal device with a configuration having improved mecr.ar.ical strength and rigidity of a case so as to prevent damage of functional parts with re spec r to bend or twist der i ving from a small size and a thin shape of the portable terminal device miain body.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a portable terminal device comprising a printed board with mounting parts mounted thereon, a lower case with receiving ribs provided corresponding to the arrangement position of the mounting parts for supporting the mounting parts, and a battery case provided below the lower case for supporting deformation of the lower case.<br>
According to the configuration, a portable terminal device with a configuration having improved mechanical strength and rigidity of a case so as to prevent damage of functional parts with respect to bend or twist deriving from a small size<br><br>
and a  thin shape of  the portable termina. device main  body can be provided.<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION   OF  THE   PRESENT INVENTION hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1 to 5 .<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram showing a configuration of a oortable terminal device according to an efrbodiment of the invention. In FIG, 1, rhe portable terminal device is provided such that a printed board 2 with mounting partn 3 mounted thereon is mounted on a lower case 1 from above, and further, a battery 4 is also mounted thoreon fro^; below.<br>
A large number of small parts other than the mounting parts 3 are also mounted on the printed board 2 and wiring is also provided thereon.  The lower case 1 of the portable terminal device according to the embodiment of the invention comprises rectangular ribs provided corresponding to the arrangement position of the mounting parts 3 for supporting the mounting parts, in addition to the conventional contacting surface.  Then, the printed board 2 is placed on the lower case 1.  The shape of the ribs is not limited to the rectangular shape, but a round or oval shape can be adopted, or a key-like shape for supporting only the four corners of the mounting parts 3<br><br>
can also be adopted.  Moreover, the inside of the shape may  be mesh-like.  It is prefcrable that the ribs are provided in points corresponding mainly to the mounting parts, in particular, packaged functional parts.<br>
FIG. 2 is a side cross-sectional view showing the accommodating configuration of the porcabie terminal device accordingly provided.  In FIG. 2, which shows the relative arrangement relationship among the lower case 1, the printed board 2, the mounting parts 3 and the receiving ribs 5 apparently, the mounting parts 3 are supported by the receiving ribs 5 provided in the lower case 1.<br>
FIG. 3 is a side cross-sectional view showing the accommodating configuration of the portable terminal device according to the embodiment of the invention, viewed from a side different from that of FIG. 2. Also in FIG. 3, which shows the relative positional relationship among the lower case 1, the printed board 2, the mounting parts 3 and the receiving ribs 5 apparently, it is observed that the mounting parts 3 are supported by the receiving ribs 5 provided in the lower case 1. Moreover, a contacting surface for supporting the printed board 2 at the center is also shown in FIG. 3. The contacting surface is disposed such that the printed board 2 is placed horizontally, without contacting with the mounting parts 3 . In FIG. 3, key buttons 6, an upper case 7, a battery case 8, a battery cell 9 and receiving ribs 10 provided in the battery case 8 are<br><br>
also shown as components of the portable terminal covice.  The shape of the ribs is not limited to the rectangular shape, but a round or oval shape can be adopted, or a key-like scape tor supporting only the four corners can also be adopted .  More over, the inside of the shape may be mesh-like.<br>
FIG. 4 is a partial enlarged side cross-sectional view of FIG. 3. What is important in FIG. 4 is the positional relationship among the lower case 1, the printed board 2, the mounting parts 3, the receiving ribs 5 and the receiving ribs 10. FIG. 4 shows the positional relationship before starting operation.<br>
FIG. 5 is a side cross-sectional view of the device of FIG. 4 in operation when the key button 6 is pressed from the arrow direction. In FIG. 5, although the printed board 2 is deformed according to the press of the key button 5, since the mounting parts 3 are supported firmly by the receiving ribs 5 without generating deformation, the lower case 1 is pressed accordingly so as to be deformed.<br>
With the premise that the battery case 8 is deformed due to a large deformation amount of the lower case I, the receiving ribs 10 provided in the battery case 8 at the position corresponding to the receiving ribs 5 provided in the lower case 1 come in contact with the battery cell 9. However, since the surface of the battery cell is made from a metal, deformation is not generated so that unlike the conventional example, there<br><br>
is no risk of function failure of the mounting parts due to a large deformation.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the deformation amount A of the printed board 2 according to the press of the key button 6. Simle it is much smaller than the deformation amount B of the conventional printed board, even wi th a thinner shape of the case or a declined rigidity of the case itself according to the trend of a smaller size, a light weight and a thinner shape as mentioned above, the maximum range is the deformation amount A of the printed board 2, and thus unlike the convenr.icna 1 example, there is no risk of function failure of the mounting parts due to a large deformation.<br>
As heretofore mentioned, since a portable terminal device according to the invention comprises a printed board with mounting parts mounted thereon, a lower case wi th receiving ribs provided corresponding to the arrangement position of the mounting parts which support the mounting parts, and a battery case provided below the lower case for supporting deformation of the lower case, the effect of improved mechanical strength and rigidity of a case so as to prevent damage of functional parts with respect to bend or twist deriving from a small size and a thin shape of the portable terminal device main body can be achieved.<br><br><br>
