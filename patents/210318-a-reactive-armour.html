				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a reactive armour capable of providing protection to armoured fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead, besides providing protection against other high calibre shaped charge warheads<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Armoured Fighting Vehicles require protection against the higher penetrating capacity of modern shaped ammunitions. Of all the applique armours used for this purpose namely passive, ceramic, composite and explosive reactive armour, the most efficient one for defeating shaped charge jet is the explosive reactive armours. However, the explosive reactive armour can also be counteracted by a recently developed warhead christened as "Tendem Warhead" which consists of two warheads. One warhead is small in calibre, nearest to nose and is known as 'pre-cursor warhead1 while the other warhead is a high calibre warhead and is known as 'main charge1. The pre-cursor warhead is designed to detonate the explosive content of the reactive element. After a short delay, the reactive element metal plate moves away and clears off the jet path. The main charge is then fired to attack the now unprotected base armour.<br>
No reactive armour or any defeating mechanism is known in the art to provide protection against tendem shaped warhead charge.<br>
NEED FOR PRESENT INVENTION<br>
There is therefore a need for a reactive armour to provide protection to armoured fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead which has also good protective capability against other high calibre shaped charge warheads.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour capable of providing protection to armoured fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead besides providing protection against all high calibre shaped charge warheads.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a hybrid approach involving combination of non-reactive element and reactive element.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour incorporating a combination of reactive element and non-reactive element which is immune to vibrations and accidental drops upto 10 metres.<br>
Â» ' Still another object of the present invention is to provide a reactive<br>
armour incorporating a combination of reactive element and non-reactive elements which is immune to small anus.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour incorporating a combination of reactive element and non-reactive element which is not affected by water soaking.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a reactive armour for protection to armoured fighting vehicles comprising an arrangement housed in a hardened steel box (1) covered with a lid (10) wherein the arrangement comprises:<br>
(a)	a non-reactive element comprising of a rolled sheet (12) of non-reactive<br>
inert material sandwiched between a metallic sheets (3) and (4) and held to<br>
box (1);<br>
(b)	a reactive element comprising of a rolled sheet (7) of an insensitive<br>
explosive sandwiched between metallic sheets (6) and (9);<br>
(c)	said non-reactive element disposed in a spaced relationship from said<br>
reactive element to define an air space (5);<br>
(d)	metal spacers (8,8) disposed between the rolled sheet and metal sheet to<br>
provide air gap.<br>
In accordance with this invention, there is provided a reactive armour to provide<br>
protection fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warheads, besides providing<br>
protection against	<br>
high calibre charge. The armour is based upon hybrid approach involving combination of reactive element and non-reactive material. The non-reactive sandwich, referred as swelling sandwich, is made with an inert material and is tightly fitted with nut and bolts against the cover of the box. This is followed by reactive armour sandwich with an air gap separating non-reactive swelling sandwich from reactive element. The non-reactive sandwich reduces the energy of the precursor jet so that it becomes incapable of causing detonation of the explosive in the reactive element. The non-reactive swelling sandwich takes care of pre-cursor shaped charge and the lower reactive element defeats the main charge. The swelling armour produces minimum collateral and base armour damage and also has minimum flying debris.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
present invention will now be illustrated with the help of a figure which shows and embodiment of the present invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation. It is to be understood that the principles and features of the present invention can be employed in different embodiments through adaptation, modifications and changes by those skilled in the art and such changes are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. In the accompanying drawings:-<br>
Fig 1: shows the construction of the reactive armour of<br>
the present invention based on hybrid approach involving combination of non-reactive element and reactive element.<br>
DESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to Fig 1, the reactive armour of the present invention comprises of a hardened steel box (1) covered with a lid (10). Inside the box, there is an arrangement involving combination of a non-reactive swelling sandwich and a reactive sandwich. The non-reactive swelling sandwich comprises of a thin sheet (12) of an inert material interposed between thin metallic sheet (3) and thin metal sheet (4). This non-reactive sandwich is tightly fitted to the cover of the box (1) with nut and bolts (2,2). The reactive sandwich comprises of a thin rolled sheet (7) of very insensitive explosive sandwiched between thin metal sheet (6) and thin metal sheet (9). Between the explosive sheet (7) and metal sheet (9), there are metal spacers (8,8). There is an air gap (5) between the non-reactive swelling sandwich and the reactive sandwich.<br>
The very insensitive explosive used in the reactive element is prepared by mixing the ingredients RDX and HTPB (as binder) taking RDX in proportion of 75 to 85 parts and HTPB in proportion of 15 to 25 parts. The mixture in the form of dough, is allowed to pass through a roller to get a uniform homogenous explosive in the form of a sheet of desired thickness. The sheet is allowed to pass through the roller 3-4 times so that there is surface smoothness. The rolled sheet is cut to the size of the metal plates (6, 8) and is sandwiched between these two metal plates to form the reactive element.<br>
The invention of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes, adaptations by those skilled in art. Such modifications, changes, adaptations are intended to be within the scope of present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	A reactive armour for protection to armoured fighting vehicles comprising an<br>
arrangement housed in a hardened steel box (I) covered with a lid (10) wherein<br>
the arrangement comprises:<br>
(a)	a non-reactive element comprising of a rolled sheet (12) of non-reactive inert<br>
material sandwiched between a metallic sheets (3) and (4) and held to box (1);<br>
(b)	a reactive element comprising of a rolled sheet (7) of an insensitive explosive<br>
sandwiched between metallic sheets (6) and (9);<br>
(c)	said non-reactive element disposed in a spaced relationship from said reactive<br>
element to define an air space (5);<br>
(d)	metal spacers (8,8) disposed between the rolled sheet and metal sheet to<br>
provide air gap.<br><br>
2.	A reactive armour as claimed in claim 1 wherein the insensitive explosive is<br>
prepared by mixing preferably 75 to 85 parts of RDX with binder preferably<br>
HTPB in the preferred proportion of 15 to 25 parts.<br>
3.	A reactive armour for protection to armoured fighting vehicles as substantially<br>
described and illustrated herein.<br></td>
