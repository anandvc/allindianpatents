				<td>Process of Increasing the Molecular Weight of<br>
Polymer Granules<br>
This invention relates to a process of increasing the molecular<br>
weight of polymer granules which come from a polycondensation<br>
plant, are at least partly crystallized, and in a<br>
postcondensation are brought in direct contact with a nitrogen-containing<br>
treatment gas, where in the postcondensation<br>
the temperature of the polymer granules is increased to 175<br>
to 250°C as compared to the temperature of the granules coming<br>
from the polycondensation plant. As polymer, there can be<br>
used polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PETB),<br>
polybutylene terephthalate (PBTP), polypropylene terephthalate<br>
(PTTP) or mixed polymeres such as polyamides (PA). These<br>
polymers in pure or doped form are preferably used for producing<br>
packaging materials such as for instance films and<br>
bottles or e.g. for producing highly viscous yarns or fibers.<br>
The polycondensation of all kinds of monomers and the increase<br>
of the molecular weight by postcondensation is known.<br>
Details are described for instance in EP 0 685 502 B1, in<br>
Rompp "Chemie-Lexikon", 10th edition, page 1316, and in<br>
Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der Organischen Chemie", 4th edition,<br>
vol. E20, part 1, "Festphasen-Polykondensation (Nachreaktion<br>
in fester Phase)" (solid-phase polycondensation - secondary<br>
reaction in solid phase). Polycondensation plants are described<br>
in Ullmanns Encyklopädie der technischen Chemie, 4th<br>
edition, vol. 19, pp. 117 - 119.<br>
It is the object underlying the invention to further improve<br>
the above-mentioned process and thereby find an inexpensive<br>
solution. In accordance with the invention this is achieved<br>
in that nitrogen-containing exhaust gas from the polycondensation<br>
plant is admixed to the treatment gas in a volume ratio<br>
of 1:1 to 1:1000, before it is introduced into the postcondensation.<br>
Due to the postcondensation, the chain length<br>
of the molecules is usually increased by at least 20 % and<br>
preferably by at least 50 %. As a result, polyester granules<br>
are produced, for example, which can preferably be used for<br>
instance for bottles or films. With the chain length of the<br>
molecules the viscosity (intrinsic viscosity) of the polymer<br>
is also increased in a manner known per se.<br>
By using nitrogen-containing exhaust gas from the polycondensation<br>
plant, the addition of fresh nitrogen from outside, in<br>
order to compensate leakages, can be reduced or be omitted<br>
completely. The nitrogen-containing exhaust gas from the<br>
polycondensation plant can also contain hydrocarbons, and advantageously<br>
it is then first of all charged into a cleaning<br>
stage together with recirculated treatment gas, in which cleaning stage hydrocarbons are removed by oxidation. The<br>
treatment gas which is then introduced into the postcondensation<br>
is virtually free from O2 and is dried expediently, before<br>
it enters the postcondensation.<br>
In the postcondensation, the treatment gas effects a levelling<br>
of the temperature and the removal of the byproducts<br>
formed by chemical reactions. Expediently, the degree of<br>
crystallization of the polymer granules should be increased<br>
before the postcondensation, e.g. in fluidized-bed crystallizers.<br>
Since the treatment gas is passed through a cleaning stage<br>
before it enters the postcondensation, the nitrogen supplied<br>
to the gas circuit for compensating losses need not be of<br>
high purity. It is enough to add fresh gas rich in nitrogen<br>
with an N2 content of 80 to 99 vol-% to the treatment gas.<br>
This means a remarkable saving of costs also at this point.<br>
Embodiments of the process will be explained with reference<br>
to the drawing which shows a flow diagram of the process.<br>
To a polycondensation plant (1) known per se, starting chemicals,<br>
i.e. chiefly alcohols and acids in the case of the production<br>
of polyester, are supplied through line (2), and inert<br>
gas rich in nitrogen is supplied through line (3). As<br>
product, polymer granules are obtained, which via line (4)<br>
are supplied to a first crystallization stage (5). A first<br>
exhaust gas comes from line (6), it is rich in O2, poor in<br>
hydrocarbons, and not suited for the further utilization in<br>
the process. A second exhaust gas poor in O2 is withdrawn<br>
via line (7). This second exhaust gas consists of N2 for<br>
about 70 to 99 vol-%, it is relatively poor in O2 and contains<br>
less than 10 vol-% O2; in addition, the second exhaust<br>
gas can also contain hydrocarbons, e.g. 1 to 50 vol-% hydrocarbons .<br>
To avoid agglutinations, the polymer granules coming from<br>
line (4) are crystallized in two stages, and in the first<br>
stage (5), e.g. in the fluidized bed, they are fluidized by<br>
means of fluidizing gas rich in nitrogen from line (8) and<br>
are brought to an elevated temperature. The temperature in<br>
the fluidized bed lies in the range from 100 to 250°C and<br>
preferably is at least 150°C. The polymer granules are then<br>
passed through line (9) to the second crystallization stage<br>
(10), which for instance constitutes a paddle mixer, where<br>
the granules are heated indirectly.<br>
The two-stage crystallization, mostly with an increase in<br>
temperature in each stage, already effects an increase in the<br>
degree of crystallization, but not a sufficient increase in<br>
the molecular weight of the polymer. For the further increase<br>
of the molecular weight and hence the viscosity, the postcondensation<br>
reactor (12) is provided, to which the granules are<br>
supplied through line (11). Dry treatment gas virtually free<br>
from O2, whose main component is nitrogen, is supplied to<br>
the reactor (12) through line (13a). The treatment gas is<br>
passed upwards through the fixed bed disposed in the reactor,<br>
the temperature being levelled and reaction products being<br>
withdrawn. The dwell times of the granules in the reactor<br>
(12) usually lie in the range from 8 to 22 hours. Polymer<br>
granules with an increased molecular weight are withdrawn<br>
from the reactor (12) via line (14) and are expediently supplied<br>
to a cooling and dedusting not represented here.<br>
Used treatment gas is withdrawn from the postcondensation reactor<br>
(12) via line (15) and mixed with the gases of lines<br>
(5a) and (7). Via line (16), the gas mixture formed is passed<br>
through a cyclone (17) for dedusting purposes, and dedusted<br>
gas is sucked off through line (18) by means of the blowers<br>
(19) and (21a) and distributed over lines (20) and (21). Via<br>
the heater (22) and line (8), the gas of line (20) flows back<br>
to the first crystallization stage (5).<br>
After a fine cleaning, the gas stream of line (21) is recirculated<br>
as treatment gas to the reactor (12). First of all,<br>
fresh gas rich in nitrogen is added to the gas of line (21)<br>
through line (23), in order to compensate gas losses. A first<br>
heating is effected in the indirect heat exchanger (24), and<br>
the gas is then supplied through line (25) to an electric<br>
heater (26), so that in line (25a) the desired inlet tempera-<br>
ture for the oxidation reactor (27) is reached. The oxidation<br>
reactor (27) includes for instance a fixed bed of a granular<br>
oxidation catalyst (for instance on the basis of platinum or<br>
palladium), in order to remove hydrocarbons by oxidation. If<br>
necessary, oxygen is supplied for instance in the form of air<br>
through line (28). The gas leaving the reactor (27) via line<br>
(29) has an elevated temperature, which can be close to<br>
400°C. The gas dissipates part of its sensible heat in the<br>
heat exchanger (24) and then flows through line (30) to another<br>
heat exchanger (31), before it is supplied through line<br>
(32) to a drying (33). The drying may operate for instance by<br>
adsorption in a manner known per se. The dried gas flows<br>
through line (13) to the heat exchanger (31) and via line<br>
(13a) flows into the reactor (12) as treatment gas. This<br>
treatment gas preferably has a carbon monoxide content of 10<br>
to 500 mg/Nm3.<br>
Example:<br>
In a conventional polycondensation plant (1), polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PETP) is produced from terephthalic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid and ethylene glycol, which polyethylene<br>
terephthalate is treated further as shown in the drawing. The<br>
change of the polycondensation state of the PETP granules is<br>
shown in Table I:<br>
A fluidized-bed crystallizer (5) is operated at 160°C and a<br>
paddle crystallizer (10) is operated at 205°C, the dwell time<br>
in the fluidized-bed crystallizer is 15 minutes and in the<br>
paddle crystallizer 60 minutes. In the reactor (12), the<br>
granules are provided in a fixed bed. At a temperature of<br>
205°C, the dwell time is 11 hours. Furthermore, there is used<br>
an electric heater (26) and an absorption drying (33) by<br>
means of a molecular sieve. 7532 kg/h PETP granules of 60°C<br>
are supplied to the fluidized-bed crystallizer (5), and air<br>
is supplied through line (28). Gas. flow rates (kg/h) and temperatures<br>
(°C) are shown in Table II:<br>
Gas compositions are indicated in Table III (in kg/h),<br>
wherein OC = organic components.<br>
