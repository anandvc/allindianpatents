CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/876,930 entitled "POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS FOR PRODUCING POLYMERS WITH LOW LEVELS OF LONG CHAIN BRANCHING" which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of organometal compositions, olefin polymerization catalyst compositions, methods for the polymerization and copolymerization of olefins using a catalyst composition, and polyolefins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known that monb-l-olefras (a-olcfins), including ethylene, can be polymerized with catalyst compositions employing titanium, zirconium, vanadium, chromium, or other metals, often combined with a solid oxide and in the presence of cocatalysts. These catalyst compositions may be useful for both homopolymerization of ethylene, as well as copolymerization of ethylene with comonomers such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, or other higher o&gt; olefins. Therefore, there exists a constant search to develop new olefin polymerization catalysts, catalyst activation processes, and methods of making and using catalysts that will provide enhanced catalytic activities and polymeric materials tailored to specific end uses.<br>
Polyethylene (PE) produced by any number of methods generally contains small to moderate amounts of, long chain branched molecules. In some instances, long chain branching (LCB) is. desired to improve bubble stability during film blowing or to enhance the processibility of resins prepared with metallocene catalysts. However for many uses, the presence of LCB is considered undesirable due to the increased elasticity that it typically imparts to the resins. Therefore the ability to control the LCB level in polyethylene using metallocene-based catalysts is a desirable goal<br>
One example of this need is seen in the use of bridged or ansa-metallocenc catalysts, which are desirable catalysts for some purposes, but which may tend to produce polymer with LCB levels that are detrimental to film performance. Therefore, new catalyst compositions and methods that allow better control of LCB levels within a desired specification range is a desirable goal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention encompasses catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, methods for polymerizing olefins, and ethylene polymers and copolymers. In the course of examining metallocene-based olefffi polymerization catalysts, it was discovered that the LCB content of PE resins made with such catalysts Was related to the type of metallocene catalyst employed, and also related to the particular solid oxide activator, or "activator-support" which constitutes one component of the catalyst composition.<br>

For example, the mixture of at least one metallocene, olefin monomer, and organoaluminum cocatalyst compound, before it is contacted with the activator-support, is one type of "precontacted" mixture. The mixture of metallocene, monomer, organoaluminum cocatalyst, and acidic activator-support, formed from contacting the precontacted mixture with the acidic activator-support, is thus termed the "postcontacted" mixture.<br>
This terminology is used regardless of what type of reaction occurs between components of the mixtures. For example, according to this description, it is possible for the precontacted organoaluminum compound, once it is admixed with the metalloccne or metallocenes and the oleftn monomer, to have a different chemical formulation and structure from the distinct organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture.<br>
This invention also comprises methods of making catalyst compositions that utilize at least one anftz-metallocene catalyst, at least one organoaluminum compound as cocatalysts, and a solid oxide activator-support. The methods of this invention include precontacting the metallocene catalyst and an organoaluminum cocatalyst with an olefin, typically but not necessarily, a monomer to be polymerized or copolymerized, prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with the solid oxide activator-support.<br>
The present invention further comprises new catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, and methods for polymerizing olefins that result in improved productivity. In one aspect, these methods can be carried out without the need for using large excess concentrations of the expensive cocatalyst methyl aluminoxane (MAO), or the catalyst composition can be substantially free of MAO. However, this invention also provides a catalyst composition comprising an drwa-metallocene compound and an aluminoxane. In this aspect, the catalyst composition is not required to comprise either an acidic activator-support wherein the activator-support comprises a chemically-treated solid oxide, and the catalyst composition is also not required to comprise an organoaluminum compound.<br>
Additionally, this invention encompasses a process comprising contacting at least one monomer and the catalyst composition under polymerization conditions to produce the polymer. Thus, this invention comprises methods for polymerizing olefins using the catalyst compositions prepared as described herein. .<br>
The present invention also encompasses new polyolefins.<br>
This invention also comprises an article that comprises the polymer produced with the catalyst composition of this invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides new catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, methods for using the catalyst compositions to polymerize olefins, olefin polymers and articles prepared therefrom. In one aspect, this invention encompasses a catalyst composition comprising a tightly-bridged anwi-metallocene compound containing an olefin functionality pendant to at least one of the cyclopentadienyl-type ligands, a solid oxide activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound. In another aspect, this invention comprises methods for making and using the catalyst composition.<br><br>

In one aspect, the present invention provides a catalyst composition comprising a bridged or ansa-metallocene compound containing a pendant unsaturated moiety attached to a cyclopentadienyl-rype ligand, along with a solid oxide activator-support and an organoaluminurn compound further disclosed herein.<br>
As used herein, the term aTwa-raetallocene refers simply to a metallocene compound in which the two T|s-cycloalkadienyl-type h'gands in the molecule are linked by a bridging moiety. Useful a/wa-metallocenes are typically "tightly-bridged", meaning that the two T|s-cycloalkadienyl-type ligands are connected by a bridging group wherein the shortest link of the bridging moiety between the Tj*-cydoaUcadienyl-type ligands is a single atom. Thus, the length of the bridge or the chain between the two TJS-cycloalkadienyl-type ligands is one atom, although this bridging atom can be substituted. The metallocenes of this invention are therefore bridged bis(r|5-cycloaUcadienyO-type compounds, wherein the t|5-cycloalkadienyl portions<br>
include cyclopentadienyl ligands, tndenyl ligands, fluorenyl ligands, and the<br>
\ like, including substituted analogs of any of these.<br>
Further, at least one of the rj'-cycloalkadienyl-type ligands is substituted with a pendant unsaturated group. That is, one substituent of the substituted bridging group comprises an unsaturated group, wherein the unsaturated group can be an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, an alkadienyl group, or a substituted analog thereof. In one aspect of the invention, one substituent of the substituted bridging group comprises an alkenyl group, in which case the ansa-metallocenes may be described as containing a chain with a pendant olefin attached to at least one/of the T|5-cycloalkadienyl-tvpe ligands.<br><br>
Further, the pendant unsaturated moiety attached to a cyclopentadienyl-type ligand can be bonded to the cyclopentadienyl-type ligand through a silicon-moiety, a carbon moiety, a germanium moiety, a tin moiety, or through other atoms.

•.<br>
atom, in which case the bridge • comprises a substituted methylene (or methylidene) group or a substituted sflylene group.<br>
In one aspect, at least one substituent of the substituted (X1) or (X2) comprises an unsaturated group having the formula<br>
-SiR42R5, wherein<br>
each R4 is independently a hydrocarbyl group or a substituted hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms;<br>

In another aspect, triethylaluminum (TEA) or triisoburylaluminum are typical organoaluminum compounds used in this invention.<br>
The Activator-Support<br>
In one aspect the present invention encompasses catalyst compositions comprising an acidic activator-support, which can comprise a chemically-treated solid oxide, and which is typically used in combination with an organoalurninum compound. In another aspect, the activator-support comprises at least one solid oxide treated with at least one electron-withdrawing anion; wherein the solid oxide can be silica, alumina, silica-alumina, aluminophosphate, aluminum phosphate, zinc aluminate, heteropolytungstates, titania, zirconia, magnesia, boria, zinc oxide, mixed oxides thereof, or mixtures thereof; and wherein the electron-withdrawing anion can be fluoride, chloride, bromide, phosphate, triflate, bisulfate, sulfate, fluoroborate, fluorosulfate, trifluorQacietate, fluorophosphates, fluorozirconate, fluorosilicate, fluorotitanate, permanganate, substituted sulfonate, unsubstituted sulfonate, or any combination thereof.<br>
The activator-support includes the contact product of at least one solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source. In one aspect, the solid oxide compound comprises an inorganic oxide. The solid oxide can be optionally calcined prior to contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source. The contact product may also be calcined either during or after the solid oxide compound is contacted with the electron-withdrawing anion source. In this aspect, the solid oxide compound may be calcined or uncalcincd. In another aspect, the. activator-support may comprise the contact product of at least one calcined solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source.<br>
The activator-support exhibits enhanced activity as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide compound. The activator-support also functions as a catalyst activator as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide. While not intending to be .bound by theory, it is believed that the activator-support may function as an ionizing solid oxide compound by<br>
weakening the metal-ligand bond between an anionic ligand and the metal in the metallocene. However, file activator-support is an activator regardless of whether it is ionizes the metallocene, abstracts an anionic ligand to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-ligand bond in the metallocene, simply coordinates to an anionic ligand when it contacts' the activator-support, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur. While the activator-support activates the metallocene in the absence of cocatalysts, it is not necessary to eliminate cocatalysts from the catalyst composition. The activation function of the activator-support is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing the corresponding untreated solid oxide. However, it is believed mat the activator-support can function as an activator, even in the absence of an organoaluminum compound, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds.<br>
In one aspect, the activator-support of this invention comprises a solid inorganic oxide material, a mixed oxide material, or a combination of inorganic oxide materials, that is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, and optionally treated with at least one other metal ion. Thus, the solid oxide of this invention encompasses oxide materials such as alumina, "mixed oxide" compounds such as silica-alumina or silica-zirconia or silica-titania, and combinations-and mixtures thereof. The mixed metal oxide compounds such as silica-alutmna, with more than one metal combined with oxygen to form a solid oxide compound, can be made by co-gellation, impregnation or chemical deposition, and are encompassed by this invention.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the activator-support further comprises a metal or metal ion such as zinc, nickel, vanadium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or airy -combination thereof. Examples of activator-supports that further comprise a metal or metal ion include, but are not limited to, zinc-impregnated chlorided alumina, zinc-impregnated<br>
fluorided alumina, zinc-impregnated chlorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated sulfated alumina, or any combination thereof.<br>
Li another aspect, the activator-support of this invention comprises a solid oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Bronsted acidic behavior. The solid oxide is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion, to form a activator-support. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that treatment of the inorganic oxide with an electron-withdrawing component augments or enhances the acidity of the oxide. Thus, the activator-support exhibits Lewis or Brensted acidity which is typically greater man the Lewis or Breasted acidity of the untreated solid oxide. One method to quantify the acidity of the chemically-treated and untreated solid oxide materials is by comparing the polymerization activities of the treated and untreated oxides under acid catalyzed reactions.<br>
In one aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises a solid inorganic oxide comprising oxygen and at least one element comprising Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 of the periodic table, or comprising oxygen and at least one element comprising the lanthanide or actinide elements.

In one aspect of this invention, the solid oxide material is chemically-treated by contacting it with at least one electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion source. Further, the solid oxide material is optionally chemically-treated with at. least one other metal ion, that can be the same as or different from .any metal element that constitutes the solid oxide material, then calcining to form a metal-containing or metal-impregnated chemically-treated solid oxide, Alternatively, a solid oxide material and an electron-withdrawing anion source are contacted and calcined simultaneously. The method by which the oxide is contacted with an electron-withdrawing component, typically a salt or an acid of an electron-withdrawing anion, includes, but is not limited to, gelling, co-getting, impregnation of one compound onto another, and the like. Typically, following any contacting method, the contacted mixture of •• oxide compound, electron-withdrawing anion, and optionally the metal ion is calcined.<br>
The electron-withdrawing component used to treat the oxide is any component that increases die Lewis or Br0nsted acidity of the solid oxide upon treatment. In one aspect, the electron-withdrawing component is an electron-withdrawing anion derived from a salt, an acid, or other compound such as a volatile organic compound that may serve as .a source or precursor for that anion. Examples of electron-wimdrawiag anions include, but are not limited<br>
to, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, phosphate, inflate, bisulfate, sulfate, fluoroborate, fluorosulfate, trifluoroacetate, phosphate, fluorophosphate, fluorozirconate, fluorosilicate, fluorotitanate, permanganate, substituted sulfonate, unsubstituted sulfbnate, and the like, including any mixtures and combinations thereof. In addition* other ionic or non-ionic compounds that serve as sources for these electron-withdrawing anions may also be employed in the present invention.

When the electron-withdrawing component comprises a salt of an electron-withdrawing anion* the counterion or cation of that salt may be any cation that allows the salt to revert or decompose back to the acid during calcining. Factors that dictate the suitability of the particular salt to serve as a source for the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, the solubility of the salt in the desired solvent, the lack of adverse reactivity of the cation, ion-pairing effects between the cation and anion, hygroscopic properties imparted to the salt by the cation, and the like, and thermal stability of the anion.

For example, one aspect of tin's invention is employing two or more electron-withdrawing anion source compounds in two or more separate contacting steps. Thus, one example of such a process by which an activator-support is<br>
prepared is as follows: a selected solid oxide compound, or combination of oxide compounds, is contacted witri a first electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a first mixture, this first mixture is then calcined, the calcined first mixture is then contacted with a second electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a second mixture, followed by calcining said second mixture to form a treated solid oxide compound. In such a process, the first and second electron-withdrawing anion source compounds are typically different compounds, although they may be the same compound.<br>

Various processes to prepare solid oxide activator-supports that can be employed in this invention have been reported; For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,107,230, 6,165,929, 6,294,494, 6,300,271, 6,316,553, 6,355,594, 6,376,415, 6,391,816, 6,395,666, 6,524,987, and 6,548,441, describe such methods, each of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
Ion-Exchangeable Activator-Supports and Layered Mineral Activator-Supports<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the activator-support used in preparing the catalyst compositions of this invention can comprise an ion-exchangeable activator-support, including hot nol; limited to silicate and aluminosilicate compounds or minerals, either with layered or non-layered structures, and any combination thereof. In another aspect of this invention, ion-exchangeable, layered aluminosilicates such as pillared clays may be used as activator-supports. When the acidic activator-support comprises an ion-exchangeable activator-support, it can optionally be treated with at. least one electron-withdrawing anion such as those disclosed herein, though typically the ion-exchangeable activator-support is not treated with an electron-withdrawing anion.<br>
hi one aspect, the activator-support of this invention can comprise clay minerals having exchangeable cations and layers capable of expanding. Typical clay mineral activator-supports include, but are not limited to, ion-exchangeable, layered aluminosilicates such as pillared clays. Although the term "support" is used, it is not meant to be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition, but rather is to be considered an active part of the<br>
catalyst composition, because of its intimate association with the ansa-metallocene and organoaluminum catalyst components. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ion exchangeable activator-support serves as an insoluble reaetaiit that reacts with the ansa-rnetallocene and organoaluminum components to form a catalyst composition used to produce polymer.<br>
In one aspect, the clay materials of this invention encompass materials either in their natural state or mat have been treated with various ions by wetting, ion exchange, or pillaring. Typically, the clay material activator-support of this invention comprises clays that have been ion exchanged with large cations, including polynuclear, highly charged metal complex cations. However, the clay material activator-supports of this invention also encompass clays that have been ion exchanged with simple salts, including, but not limited to, salts of Al(in), Fe(II), Fe<ni and zn with ligands such as halide acetate sulfate nitrate or nitrite.></ni>
In one aspect, the clay activator-support of this invention comprises pillared clays. The term pillared clays is used to refer to clay materials that have been ion exchanged with large, typically polynuclear, highly charged metal complex cations. Examples of such ions include, but are not limited to, Keggin ions which may have charges such as 7+, various polyoxometallates, and other large ions. Thus, the term pillaring refers to a simple exchange reaction in which the exchangeable cations of a clay material are replaced with large, highly charged ions, such as Keggin ions. These polymeric cations are then immobilized within the interlayers of the clay and when calcined are coverted to metal oxide "pillars," effectively supporting the clay layers as column-like structures. Thus, once the clay is dried and calcined to produce the supporting pillars between clay layers, the expanded lattice structure is maintained and the porosity is enhanced. The resulting pores may vary in shape and size as a function of the pillaring material and the parent clay<br>
material used. Examples of pillaring and pillared clays are found in: T.J. Pirmavaia, Science 220 (4595), 365-371 (1983); J.M. Thomas, Intercalation Chemistry, (S, Whittkgton and A, Jaeobson, eds.) Ch. 3, pp. 55-99, Academic Press, Inc., (1972); U.S. Patent No. 4,452,910; U.S. Patent No. 5,376,611; and U.S. Patent No. 4,060,480; each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
The pillaring process utilizes clay minerals having exchangeable cations and layers capable of expanding. Any pillared clay that can enhance the polymerization of olefins in the- catalyst composition of the present invention can be used. Therefore, suitable clay minerals for pillaring include, but are not limited to: allophanes; smectites, both dioctahedral (Al) and tri-octahedral (Mg) and derivatives thereof such as montmorillonites (bentonites), nontronites, hectorites, or laponites; halloysites; vermiculites; micas; fluoromicas; chlorites,; mixed-layer clays; the fibcrous clays including but not limited to sepiolites, attapulgites, and palygorskites; a serpentine clay; illite; laponite; saponite; or any combination thereof. In one aspect, the pillared clay activator-support comprises bentonite or monlmorillonite. The principal component of bentonite is montmorillonite.<br>
The pillared clay may be pretreated in the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, a pillared bentonite was pretreated by drying at 300°C under an inert atmosphere, typically dry nitrogen, for 3 hours, before being added to the polymerization reactor. This example of a pretreament is not limiting, because preheating steps such as this many be carried out at many other temperatures and times, including a combination of temperature and time steps, all of which are encompassed by this invention.<br>
The ion-exchangeable activator-supports such as pillared clays used to prepare the catalyst compositions of mis invention can be combined with other inorganic support materials, including, but are not limited to, zeolites, inorganic oxides, phosphated inoreanic oxides, and the like.

The amount of awsa-metallbeelie compound in relation to the ion-exchangable activator-support used to prepare the catalyst composition of this invention is typically from O.lwt%to 15 wt% awsa-metaliocene complex, based on the weight of the activator-support component (not based cm the final metallocene-clay mixture). It was also found that from 1 wt% to 10 wt% attsa-metallocene works well to afford a catalyst that operates at desired activities,<br>
The mixture of anjc-metallocene and clay activator-support can be contacted and mixed for any length of time to allow thorough contact between the a/ua-metallocene and activator-support. Sufficient deposition of the metallocene component on the clay may be achieved without heating a mixture of clay and metallocene complex. For example, the ansa-metallocene compound and .the clay material are simply mixed from room temperature to 93.3°C (200°F) in order to achieve the depositition of the a/tsa-metallocene on the clay activator-support In another aspect, the a/wa-metallocene compound and the clay material are mixed from .37.8*0 (100°F) to 82.2°C (180°F) in order to achieve the deposition of the onsa-metalloceae on the clay activator-support.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention encompasses catalyst compositions comprising an acidic activator-support, which can comprise a layered mineral. The term "layered mineral" is used herein to describe materials such as clay minerals, pillared clays, ion-exchanged clays, exfoliated<br>
clays, exfoliated clays gelled into another oxide matrix, layered minerals mixed or diluted with other materials, and the like, or any combination thereof. When the acidic activator-support comprises a layered mineral, it can optionally be treated with at least one electron-withdrawing anion such as those disclosed herein, though typically the layered mineral is not treated with an electron-withdrawing anion. Foe example, at least one clay mineral can be used as the activator-support.<br>
Clay minerals generally include the large group of finely-crystalline, sheet-like layered minerals that are found in nature in fine-grained sediments, sedimentary rocks, and the like, and which constitute a class of hydrous silicate and aluminosilicate minerals with sheet-like structures and very high surface areas. This term is also used to describe hydrous magnesium silicates with a phyllosilicate structure. Examples of clay minerals that can be used in this invention include, but are not limited to, allophanes; smectites, both dioctahedral (Al) and tri-octahedral (Mg) and derivatives thereof such as montmorillonites (bentonites), nontranites, hectorites, or laponites; halloysites; vermiculites; micas; fluoromicas; chlorites; mixed-layer clays; the fiberous clays including but not limited to sepiolites, attapulgites, and palygorskites; a serpentine clay; illite; laponite; saponite; or any combination thereof.

In one aspect, the organoboron compound comprises neutral boron compounds, borate salts, or combinations thereof. For example, die organoboron compounds of this invention can comprise a ftuoroorgano boron compound, a fluoroorgano borate compound, or a combination thereof Any fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound known in the art can be utilized. The term fluoroorgano boron' compounds has its usual meaning to refer to neutral compounds of the form BY3, The term fluoroorgano borate compound also has its usual meaning to refer to the monoanionic salts of a fluoroorgano boron compound of the form [cationJ*"[BY4]~, where Y represents a fiuorinated organic group. For convenience, fluoroorgano boron and fluoroorgano borate compounds ate typically-referred to collectively by organoboron compounds, or by either name as the context requires.<br>

Generally, any amount of organoboron compound can be utilized in this invention. In one aspect, the molar ratio of the organoboron compound to the metallocene compound in the composition is from 0.1:1 to 10:1. Typically, the amount of the fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound used as a cocatalyst for the metallocene is in a range of from 0.5 mole to 10 moles of boron corapoufidper mole of metallocene compound. In one aspect, the amount of fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound used as a cocatalyst for the metallocene is in a range of from 0.8 mole to 5 moles of boron compound per mole of metallocene compound.<br>
The Optional Ionizing Ionic Compound*Cocatalyst<br>
In one aspect, the present, invention provides a catalyst composition comprising an flnsa-metallocene compound containing a pendant unsaturated moiety, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound, as disclosed herein. In another aspect, the present invention provides a catalyst composition comprising an optional ionizing .ionic compound cocatalyst in addition to these other components In still another aspect, the present invention provides a catalyst composition comprising an flftwsr-metallocene compound containing a pendant unsaturated moiety, an ionizing ionic compound cocatalyst, an optional activator-support, and an optional organoaluminum compound Examples of ionizing ionic compound are disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 5,576,259 and 5,807,938, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br><br>
An ionizing ionic compound -is an.ionic compound which can function to enhance activity of the catalyst composition. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may be capable of reacting with the metallocene compound and converting the metallocene into a cationic metallocene compound. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may function as an ionizing compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand, possibly a non-ri3-alkadienyl ligand such as (X3) or (X4), from the metallocene. However, the ionizing ionic compound is an activator regardless of whether it is ionizes the metallocene, abstracts an (X3) of (X4) ligand in a fashion as to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-(X3) or metal-CX4) bond in the metallocene, simply coordinates to an (X3) or (X4) ligand, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur. Further, it is not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate the metallocene only. The activation function of the ionizing ionic compound is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing catalyst composition that does not comprise any ionizing ionic compound.<br>

The Olefin Monomer<br>
In one aspect, the present invention encompasses a polymerization catalyst composition comprising- a tightly-bridged awa-metallocene compound containing a chain with a pendant olefin attached to the bridge, a solid oxide activator-support, and an organoalummum compound.<br>
Unsaturatcd reactants that are useful in the polymerization processes with catalyst compositions and processes of this invention include olefin compounds having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule and having at<br><br>
least one olefinic double bond. This invention encompasses homopolymerization processes using a single olefin such as ethylene or propylene, as well as copolymerization reactions with at least one different olefinic compound. In one aspect of a copolymerization reaction of ethylene, copolymers of ethylene comprise a major amount of ethylene (&gt;50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer <so mole percent though this is not a requirement. the comonomers that can be copolymerized with ethylene should have from three to carbon atoms in their molecular chain.></so>
Acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, terminal (a), internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-ftmctionalized olefins may be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that may be polymerized with me catalysts of .this invention include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyH-butene, isobutylene, l-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal notien.es, the five normal decenes, and mixtures of any two or more thereof,. Cyclic and bicycliq olefins, including but not limited to, cyclopentene, cyelohexene, norbomylene, norbornadiene, and the like, may also be polymerized as described above.<br>
In one aspect, when a copolymer is desired, the monomer ethylene may be copolymerized with a comonomer. In another aspect, examples of the comonomer include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, isobutylene, l-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentenej 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyI-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, lie four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, or the five normal decenes. In another aspect, the comonomer may be 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, or styrene.<br>
In one aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone to produce the copolymer is generally from 0.01 to 10 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. In another aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone is from 0.01 to 5 weight percent comonomer, and in still another aspect, from 0.1 to 4 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give the above described concentrations by weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
While not intending to be bound by this theory, in the event that branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used as reactants, it is believed that steric hindrance may impede and/or slow the polymerization process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. In one aspect, at least one reactant for the catalyst compositions of this invention is ethylene, so the polymerizations are either homopolymerizations or copolymerizations with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of this invention may be used in polymerization of diolefin compounds, including but are not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, l^pentadiene, and 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
Preparation of the Catalyst Composition<br>
This invention encompasses a catalyst composition and method comprising the contact product of an arua-metallocene, a solid oxide activator-support, and an organoalumujum compound. In one aspect of this<br>
•.<br>
invention, the aruuz-metallocene is precontacted with an olefinic monomer, not necessarily the olefin monomer to be polymerized, and an organoaluminum cocatalyst for a first period of time prior to contacting this precontacted<br>
mixture with the solid oxide activator-support. In one aspect, the first period of time for contact, the precontact time, between the flasfl-metallocene, the olefinie monomer, and the organoaluminuih cocatalyst typically range from time 1 minute to 24 hours, and from 0.1 to 1 hour is typical. Precontact times from 10 minutes to 30 minutes are also typical.<br>
Once the precontacted mixture of arwa-metallocene, olefin monomer, and organoaluminum cocatalyst is contacted with the solid oxide activator, this composition (further comprising the solid oxide activator) is termed the postcontacted mixture. Typically, the postcontacted mixture may be allowed to remain in contact for a second period .of time, the postcontact time, prior to being initiating the polymerization process. In one aspect, postcontact times between the solid oxide activator-support and the precontacted mixture typically range from time I minute to 24 hours, and from 0.1 to 1 hour is typical. Postcontact times from 10 minutes to 30 minutes are also typical.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the various catalyst components (for example, owo-metallocene, activator-support, organoaluminum cocatalyst, and optionally an unsaturated hydrocarbon) can be contacted in the polymerization reactor simultaneously while the polymerization reaction is proceeding. Alternatively, any two or more of these catalyst components may be precontacted in a vessel prior to their entering the reaction zone. This precontacting step can be continuous process, in which the precontacted product is fed continuously to the reactor, or it can be a stepwise or batchwise process in which a batch of precontacted product can be added to make a catalyst composition. This precontacting step can be carried out over a time period that can range from a few seconds to as much as several days, or longer. In this aspect, the continuous precontacting step can last typically from 1 second to 1 hour. Also in this aspect, the continuous precontacting step can last typically from 10 seconds to 45 minutes, or from 1 minute to 30 minutes.<br>
Alternatively the precontacting process can be carried out in multiple steps, rather than a single step, in which multiple mixtures are prepared, each comprising a different set of catalyst components. For example, at least two catalyst components can be contacted forming a first mixture, followed by contacting the first mixture with at least one other catalyst component forming a second mixture, and so forth.<br>
Multiple precontacting steps can be carried out in a single vessel or in multiple vessels. Further, multiple precontacting steps can be carried out in series (sequentially), in parallel, or a combination thereof. For example, a first mixture of two catalyst components can be formed in a first vessel, a second mixture comprising the first mixture plus one additional catalyst component can be formed in the first vessel or in a second vessel, which is typically placed downstream of the first vessel,.<br>
In another aspect, one or more of the catalyst components may be split and used in different precontacting treatments. For example, part of a catalyst component can be fed into a. first precontacting vessel for precontacting with at least one other catalyst component, while the remainder of that same catalyst component can be fed into a second precontacting vessel for precontacting with at least one other catalyst component, or can be fed directly into the reactor, or a combination thereof. The precontacting may be carried out in any suitable equipment, such as tanks, stirred mix tanks, various static mixing devices, a flask, a vessel of any type, or any combination thereof.<br>
In one aspect, for example, a catalyst composition of this invention is prepared by contacting 1-hexene, triethylalurninum, and a zirconium ansa-metallocene such as [-(ii^SrCl-pTcpmyldimelJiylsilyOindenyl)-!^3^-fluorenyl)-l-phenylethane zirconium dichloride for at least 30 minutes, followed by contacting this prccontacted mixture with a sulfated alumina<br>
activator-support for at least  10 minutes up to one hour to form the active catalyst.<br>
The precontacting step typically increases the productivity of the polymer as compared to the same catalyst composition that is prepared without this precontacting step. The enhanced activity catalyst composition of this invention can be used for homopolymerization of an ct-olefin monomer such as ethylenc or copolymerization of an a-olefin and a comonomer. However, neither a precontacting step nor a postcontacting step are required for this invention.<br>
The postcontacted mixture may be heated at a temperature and for a duration sufficient to allow adsorption, impregnation, or interaction of precontacted mixture and the solid, oxide activator-support, such that a portion of the components of the precontacted mixture is immobilized, adsorbed, or deposited thereon. For example, the postcontacted mixture may be heated from between -17,8°C (0°F) to 65.5'C (150°F). Temperatures between 4.4°C(40°F) to 35°C (95°F) are typical if the mixture is heated at all.<br>
In one aspect, the molar ratio of the a/isa-metallocene compound to the organoaluminum compound may be from 1:1 to 1:10,000. In another aspect, the molar ratio of the anso-metalloeene compound to the organoaluminum compound may be from 1:1 to 1:1,000^ and in another aspect, from 1:1 to 1:100. These molar ratios reflect the ratio of aroa-metaUocene compound to the total amount of organoaluminum compound in both the precontacted mixture and the postcontacted mixture .combined.<br>
When a precontacting step is-used, generally, the molar ratio of olefin monomer to attsa-metallocene compound hi the precontacted mixture may be from 1:10 to 100,000:1, or from 10:1 to 1,000:1.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the solid oxide activator to the organoaluminum compound may range from 1:5 to 1,000:1.<br>
In another aspect, the weight ratio of the solid oxide activator to the organoaluminum compound may be from 1:3 to 100:1, and in yet another aspect, from 1:1 to 50:1.<br>
In a further aspect of this invention, die weight ratio of the ansa-rnetallocene to solid oxide activator-support may be from 1:1 to 1:1,000,000. Yet another aspect of this invention is the weight ratio of the a/ua-metallocene to solid oxide activator-support which may be from 1:10 to 1:100,000, and in another aspect, from 1:20 to l:10QO.;<br>
One aspect of this invention is that aluminoxane is not required to form the catalyst composition disclosed herein, a feature that allows lower polymer production costs. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention can use AlR3-type organoaluminum compounds and an activator-support in the absence of aluminoxanes. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the organoaluminum compounds likely do not activate the metallocene catalyst in Die same manner as an organoaluminoxane.<br>
Additionally, no expensive borate compounds or MgCl2 are required to form the catalyst composition of this invention, although aluminoxane, borate compounds, MgCl2, or any combination thereof can optionally be used in the catalyst composition of this invention. Further, in one aspect, cocatalysts such as aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, or any combination thereof may be used as cocatalysts with the ansa-metallocene, either in the presence or in the absence of the activator-support, and either in the presence or in the absence of the organoalurnuium compounds.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, this invention provides a process to produce a catalyst composition, comprising:<br>
contacting an an-sa-metallocene, an olefin, and an organoaluminum compound for a first period of time to form a precontacted mixture comprising a precontacted o/wa-metallocene, a precontacted organoaluminum compound, and a precontacted olefin; and<br>
contacting the precontacted mixture with an activator-support and optionally additional OTganoaluminum compound for a second period of time to form a postcontacted mixture comprising a postcontacted ansa-metallocene, a postcontacted organoaluminum compound, a postcontacted olefin, and a postcontacted activator-support. In this aspect, the precontacted

In one aspect, the catalyst activity of the catalyst of this invention is typically greater man or equal to 100 grams polyethylene per gram of chemically treated solid oxide per hour (abbreviated gP/(gCTSQ-hr)). In another aspect, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater man or equal to 250 gP/(gCTSO-hr), and in another aspect, an activity of greater than or equal to 500 gP/(gCTSQ-hr). In still another aspect, the catalyst of this invention may be characterizesd by an activity of greater than or equal to 1000 gP/(gCTSOhr), and in another aspect, an activity of greater than or. equal to 2000 gP/(gCTSO-hr). This activity is measured under slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as the diluent, and with a polymerization temperature of 90 "C., and an ethylene pressure of 37.92 bar (550 psig). The reactor should have substantially no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling upon making these measurements.<br>
Utility of the Catalyst Composition In Polymerization Processes<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such polymerization processes include, but are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and the like, including multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce ethylene-containing polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor.<br>
After catalyst activation, a catalyst composition is used to homopolymerize ethylene, or copplymerize ethylene with a comonomer. In<br>
one aspect, a typical polymerization method is a slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process), which is Well known in the art and is disclosed, for example in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. Other polymerization methods of the present invention for slurry processes are those employing a loop reactor of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, and those utilized in a plurality of stirred reactors either in series, parallel, or combinations thereof, wherein the reaction conditions are different in the different reactors, which is also incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
In one aspect, polymerization temperature for this invention may range from 60°C to 280°C, and in another aspect, polymerization reaction temperature may range from 70°Cto 110°C.<br>
The polymerization reaction typically occurs in an inert atmosphere, that is, in atmosphere substantial free of oxygen and under substantially anhydrous conditions, thus, in the absence of water as the reaction begins. Therefore a dry, inert atmosphere, for example, dry nitrogen or dry argon, is typically employed in the polymerization reactor.<br>
The polymerization reaction pressure can be any pressure that does not terminate the polymerization reaction, and it typically conducted at a pressure higher than the pretreatment pressures. In one aspect, polymerization pressures may be from .atmospheric pressure to 68.95 bar (1000 psig). In another aspect, polymerization pressures may be from 3.45 bar (50 psig) to 55.16 bar (800 psig). Further, hydrogen can be used in the polymerization process of this invention to control polymer molecular weight.<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such processes that can polymerize monomers into polymers include, but are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and multi-reactor<br>
combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known hi the art to produce olefin-containing polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor. Typically, the polymerizations disclosed herein are carried out using a slurry polymerization process in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons which are liquid under reaction conditions. The term "diluent" as'used in mis disclosure does not necessarily mean an inert material, as this term is meant to include compounds and compositions that may contribute to polymerization process. Examples of hydrocarbons mat can be used as diluents include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Typically, isobutane is used as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of this technology are found in U.S. Patent Nos, 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892; each of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
For purposes of the invention, the term polymerization reactor includes any polymerization reactor or polymerization reactor system known in the art that is capable of polymerizing olefin monomers to produce homopolymers or copolymers of the present invention. Such reactors can comprise slurry reactors, gas-phase reactors, solution reactors, or any combination thereof. Gas phase reactors can comprise fluidized bed reactors or tubular reactors. Slurry reactors can comprise vertical loops or horizontal loops. Solution reactors can comprise stirred tank or autoclave reactors.<br>
Polymerization reactors suitable for the present invention can comprise at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, at least one reactor system, at least one polymer recovery system or any suitable combination thereof. Suitable reactors for the present invention can further comprise any, or combination of, a catalyst storage<br>
system, an extrusion system, a cooling system, a diluent recycling system, or a control system Such reactors can comprise continuous take-off and direct recycling of catalyst, diluent, and polymer. Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of a monomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from mis reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent<br>
Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention can comprise one type of reactor per system or multiple reactor systems comprising two or more types of reactors operated in parallel or in series. Multiple reactor systems can comprise reactors connected together to perform polymerization, or reactors that are not connected. The polymer can be polymerized in one reactor under one set of conditions, and then the polymer can be transferred to a second reactor for polymerization under a different set of conditions.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one loop slurry reactor. Such reactors are known in the art and can comprise vertical or horizontal loops. Such loops can comprise a single loop or a series of loops. Multiple loop reactors can comprise both vertical and horizontal loops. The slurry polymerization can be performed in an organic solvent mat can disperse the catalyst and polymer. Examples of suitable solvents include butane, hexane, cyclohexane, octane, and isobutane. Monomer, solvent, catalyst and any comonorner are continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Polymerization can occur at low temperatures and pressures. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid resin.<br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through the fiuidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. The recycle stream can be withdrawn from the<br>
fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from me.reactor and new or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone.<br>
In still another aspect of the- invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a tubular reactor. Tubular reactors can make polymers by free radical initiation, or by employing the catalysts typically used for coordination polymerization. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are. added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams are intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a solution polymerization reactor. During solution polymerization, the monomer is contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed during polymerization to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. The polymerization can be<br>
effected in a batch manner, or in a continuous manner. The reactor can comprise a series of at least one separator that employs high pressure and low pressure to separate the desired polymer.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise the combination of two or more reactors. Production of polymers in multiple reactors can include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors can be different from the operating conditions of the other reactors. Alternatively, polymerization in multiple reactors can include the manual transfer of polymer from one reaotor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Such reactors can include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas reactors, a combination of loop and gas reactors, a combination of autoclave reactors or solution reactors with gas or loop reactors, multiple solution reactors, or multiple autoclave reactors.<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be formed into various articles, including but not limited to, household containers, utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes can form these articles. Usually, additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order to provide desired effects. By using the invention described herein, articles can likely be produced at a lower cost, while maintaining most or all of the unique properties of polymers produced with metallocene catalysts.<br>
Ethylene Polymers Prepared According to this Invention<br>
In one aspect, the ethylene polymer produced using the catalyst composition of this invention may be characterized by lower levels of long chain branching (LCB) than are typically observed when using ansa-<br>
metallocene catalysts without a pendant unsaturated moiety attached to the bndge, or when using supports other than the solid oxide activator-supports of this invention. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate various aspects of olefin homopolymer produced according to this invention.<br>
Generally, Figures 1 and 3 plot tog(^0) versus log (Mw) for polymers prepared according to the examples: and Table'3, and illustrates how reduced LCB levels are manifested. Figure 2 provides a comparison of the polymers formed using a catalyst comprising an artsa-metallocene with no pendant olefin (compound A) versus a catalyst comprising an an&amp;z-metallocene with a pendant olefin on the bridge between the two cyclopentadienyl-type ligands (compound B). Figure 3 provides-a comparison of the polymers formed using a catalyst comprising an a/tta-rnetaiiocene with a pendant olefin on the bridge between the two cyclopentadienyl-type ligands (compound B) versus a catalyst comprising an anra-metallocene with a pendant olefin on a cyclopentadienyl-type ligand, specifically, an indenyl ligand (compound C).<br>
Linear polyethylene polymers are observed to follow a power law relationship between their zero shear viscosity, 770, and their weight average molecular weight, Mw, with a power very close to 3.4. This relationship is shown by a straight line with a slope of 3.4 when the logarithm of rj0 is plotted versus the logarithm of Afw. Deviations from this linear polymer line are generally accepted as being caused by the presence of long-chain branching (LCB). Janzen and Colby presented a model that predicts the expected deviation from the linear plot of Iog(f70) vs. log(AQ for given frequencies of LCB as a function of the weight average molecular weight of the polymer. See: ["Diagnosing long-chain branching in pplyethylenes," J. Mpl. Struct. 485-486, 569-584 (1999)], which hrincorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 shows lines for the expected behavior for linear polymers and for the expected increases in zero shear viscosity for the frequencies of 1LCB/106 carbons, 1 LCB/103 carbons, and 1 LCB/104 carbons as a function of Mw. The points correspond to the zero shear viscosities as obtained from fits of the melt viscosity data to the Carreau-Yasuda equation as a function of Mw obtained from size-exclusion chromatography measurements for the polymers prepared according to this invention and to their comparative examples. The reduction in the amount of deviation of the zero shear viscosities from the linear polymer line for the polymers according to this invention compared to their comparative examples indicates the lower levels of LCB for these polymers. Thus, Examples 1 and 4 exhibit the highest level of LCB of those shown in Figures 2 and 3, with inventive Example 5 exhibiting the lowest level of LCB as compared to the other examples.<br>
Definitions<br>
In order to more clearly define the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.<br>
The term "polymer" is used herein to mean homopolymers comprising ethylene and/or copolymers of ethylene and another olefinic comonomer. "Polymer" is also used herein to mean homopolymers and copolymers of any other polymerizable monomer disclosed herein.<br>
The term "cocatalysf is generally used herein to refer to the organoaluxninum compounds that may constitute one component of the catalyst composition, but also refers to the optional components of the catalyst composition including, but not limited to, aluminoxanes, organoboron<br>
compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds, as disclosed herein. In one aspect, cocatalysts maybe organoaluminum compounds of the formula AlpC5)n(X6)3.n, wherein (X5) is a hydrocarbyl having from I to 20 carbon atoms; (X6) is alkoxide or aryloxide, any of which having from .1 to 20 carbon atoms, halide, or hydride; and n is a number from 1 to 3, inclusive. The term cocatalyst may be used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mechanism by which the compound may operate.<br>
The term "precontacted" mixture is used herein to describe a first mixture of catalyst components that .are contacted for a first period of time prior to the first mixture being used to form a "postcontacted" or second mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a second period of time. Typically, the precontacted mixture describes a mixture of metallocene, olefin monomer, and organoaluminum compound, before this mixture is contacted with the acidic activator-support and optionally an organoaluminum compound. Thus, "precontacted" describes components that are used to contact each other, but prior to contacting the components in the second, postcontacted mixture. Accordingly, this invention may occasionally distinguish between a component used to prepare the precontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepared. For example, according to this description, it is possible for the precontacted organoaluminum compound, once it is contacted with the metallocene and the olefin monomer, to have reacted to form at least one different chemical compound, formulation, or structure from the distinct organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture. In this case, the precontacted organoaluminum compound or component is described as comprising an organoaluminum compound that was used to prepare the precontacted mixture.<br>
Similarly, the term "postcontacted" mixture is used herein to describe a second mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a second period of time, and one constituent of which is the "precontacted" or first mixture of<br>
catalyst components that were contacted for a first period of time. Typically,<br>
the term "postcontacted" mixture is used herein to describe the mixture of<br>
metallocene,   olefin   monomer,  organoaluminum  compound,   and   acidic<br>
activator-support, formed from contacting the precontacted mixture of a<br>
portion of these components with the any additional components added to<br>
make up the postcontacted mixture.   Generally, the additional component<br>
added to make up the postcontacted mixture is the solid oxide activator, and<br>
optionally may include an organoaluminura compound the same or different<br>
from the organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted<br>
mixture,  as  described herein.     Accordingly,  this  invention  may  also<br>
occasionally   distinguish   between   a   component  used   to   prepare   the<br>
postcontacted mixture and mat component after the mixture has been prepared.<br>
The term awsa-metallocene tightly-bridged metallocene describes a<br>
metallocene compound in which the two Tf-cycloalkadienyl-type ligands in<br>
the molecule are linked by a bridging moiety, wherein the shortest link of the<br>
bridging moiety comprises one atom.  Thus, the length of the bridge or the<br>
chain between the two cyclopenladienyl-type ligands is a single atom,<br>
although this bridging atom is substituted.   Thus, the metallocenes of this<br>
invention are bridged bis(r)3-cycloalkadienyl)-type compounds, wherein the<br>
n5-cycloalkadienyl portions include cyclopentadienyl ligands, indenyl ligands,<br>
fluorenyl ligands, and the like, including substituted derivatives or analogs of<br>
any of these.    Possible substituents on these ligands include hydrogen,<br>
therefore the description "substituted derivatives thereof' in mis invention<br>
comprises    partially    saturated    ligands    such    as    tetrahydroindenyl,<br>
tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially<br>
saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially<br>
saturated fluorenyl, and the like. La some contexts, the metallocene is referred<br>
to simply as the "catalyst", in much the same way the term "cocatalyst" is used herein to refer to the organoaluminum compound.<br>
The terms "catalyst composition," "catalyst mixture," and the like do not depend upon the actual product of the reaction of the components of the mixtures, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the aluminum cocatalyst, anttj-metallocene, any, olefin monomer used to prepare a precontacted mixture, or the solid, oxide activator after combining these components. Therefore, the terms catalyst composition, catalyst mixture, and the like include both heterogeneous compositions and homogenous compositions.<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" is used to specify a hydrocarbon radical group that includes, but is not limited to aryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkadienyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, and the like, and includes all substituted, unsubstituted, branched, linear, heteroatom substituted derivatives thereof.<br>
The terms solid oxide activator-support, acidic activator-support, activator-support, treated solid oxide compound, or simply "activator," and the like are used herein to indicate a treated, solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Bronsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an elcctron-wiuidrawing anion source compound. Thus, the treated solid oxide compound comprises the .calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide compound with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the activator-support or "treated solid oxide compound" comprises at least one ionizing, acidic solid oxide compound. The terms support or activator-support are not used to imply these components are inert, and this component should not be-construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition.<br>
The term "clay" is used herein to refer to that component of the catalyst composition, a substantial portion of which constitutes a clay mineral or a mixture of clay minerals that have been pretreated by either exchanging cations, pillaring or simply wetting, that may be used as a activator-support in the catalyst composition described herein. The transition metal compound and organometal cocatalyst are reacted with the clay activator-support to form the active catalyst. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, the clay component of the catalyst composition of this invention probably functions as a activator-support for the transition metal compound, as well as a cocatalyst from the standpoint that it is in intimate physical chemical contact with the transition metal component<br>
As used herein, the collective term "clay mineral" is used herein to describe the large group of finely-crystalline, sheet like clay minerals that are found in nature in fine-grained sediments, sedimentary rocks, and the like. Clay minerals are a class of hydrous silicate and aluminosilicate minerals with sheet-like structures and very high surface areas. This term is also used to describe hydrous magnesium silicates with a phyllosilicate structure. Many common clay minerals belong to the kaolinite, rnontmorillonite, or illite groups of clays. Thus, the term "clay mineral" is not used herein to refer to the fine-grained soil consisting of mineral particles, not necessarily clay minerals, that are less than 0.002 mm in size.<br>
The term "pillared clay" is used herein to refer to a component of the catalyst composition comprising clay minerals, typically of the of the smectite group and other phylosilicates in addition to sepiolites and palygorskites, that have been ion exchanged with large, typically, polynuclear, highly charged metal complex cations. Examples of such ions include, but are not limited to, Keggin ions which may have charges .such as 7+, various polyoxometallates, and other large ions. Thus, the term pillaring refers to a simple exchange reaction in which the exchangeable cations of a clay material are replaced with<br>
large, highly charged ions, such as Keggin ions. These polymeric cations are then immobilized within the intertayers of the clay and when calcined are coverted to metal oxide "pillars," effectively supporting the clay layers as column-like structures. Examples of pillaring and pillared clays are found in: TJ. Pinnavaia, Science 220 (4595), 365-371 (1983); J.M. Thomas, Intercalation Chemistry, (S. Whittihgton and A. Jacobson, eds.) Ch. 3, pp. 55-99, Academic Press, Inc., (1972); U.S. Patent No. 4,452,910; U.S. Patent No. 5,376,611; and U.S. Patent No. 4,060,480; each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the typical methods, devices and materials are herein described.<br>
AH publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed above and throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue! of prior invention.<br>
For any particular compound disclosed herein, any general structure presented also encompasses all conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that may arise from a particular set of substitutents. The general structure also encompasses all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context requires. .<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may<br>
be had to various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims.<br>
In the following examples, unless otherwise specified, the syntheses and preparations described herein were carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen and/or argon. Solvents were purchased from commercial sources and were typically dried over activated alumina prior to use. Unless otherwise specified, reagents were obtained from commercial sources,<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
General Testing Procedures<br>
Melt index (MI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition F at 190"C with a.2,160 gram weight.<br>
High load melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition E at 190*C with a 21,600 gram weight.<br>
Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) on a compression molded sample, cooled at 15"C per hour, and conditioned for 40 hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505 and ASTM D1928, procedure C.<br>
Molecular weight and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a PL-GPC 220 (Polymer Labs, UK) system equipped with a differential refractive index detector and three 7-5 -mm x 300 mm 20 urn Mixed A-LS columns (Polymer Labs) running at 145 9C. The flow rate of the mobile phase, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) containing 0.5 g/L 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), was set at 1 mL/min and the concentration of polymer solutions was generally kept in the range of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL, depending on the molecular weights. Sample preparation was conducted at. 150 *C for 4 h with<br>
occasional and gentle agitation before the solutions being transferred to sample vials for injection. In order to minimize unbalanced solvent peak, solvent with the same composition as the mobile phase was used for solution preparation. The integral calibration method was. employed to deduce molecular weights and molecular weight distributions using a Chevron Phillips Chemicals Company's broad linear polyethylene, Marlex BHB5003, as the broad standard. The integral table of the broad standard was pre-determined in a separate experiment with SEC-MALS,<br>
Meh viscosity measurements to determine shear viscosity characteristics<br>
Small-strain oscillatory shear measurements were performed on an ARES oscillatory rheometer using parallel-plate geometry (TA Instruments, formerly Rheometrics Inc.). Data were typically obtained over an angular frequency range of 0.03 to 100 rad/s at a! temperature of 190 °C.<br>
Fluff samples were stabilized with O.I wt% BHT dispersed in acetone and then vacuum dried before molding. Samples were compression molded at 184 °C for a total of three minutes. The samples were allowed to melt at a relatively low pressure for one minute and then subjected to a high molding pressure for an additional two minutes. The molded samples were men quenched in a cold (room temperature) press. 2 mm x 25.4 mm diameter disks were stamped out of the molded slabs for rheological characterization.<br>
The test chamber of the rheometer was blanketed in nitrogen in order to minimize polymer degradation. The rheometer was preheated to the initial temperature of the study. Upon sample loading and after oven thermal equilibration, the specimens were squeezed between the plates to a 1.6 mm thickness and the excess was trimmed.<br>
Strains were generally maintained at a single value throughout a frequency sweep but larger strain values were used for low viscosity samples to maintain a measurable torque. Smaller strain values were used for high<br>
viscosity samples to avoid overloading the torque transducer and to keep within the linear viscoelastic limits of the sample. The instrument automatically reduces the strain at high frequencies if necessary to keep from overloading the torque transducer.<br>
Viscosity data were fit with a modified Carreau-Yasuda model [R. Byron Bird, Robert C. Armstrong, and Ole Hassager, Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids, Volume I, Fluid Mechanics, (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1987), p 171-172], which is incorporated by reference herein to obtain estimates of the zero shear viscosity, viscous relaxation time, and a breadth parameter, as indicated below.<br>
wherein:       (77*) - magnitude of the complex viscosity in Pa-s o&gt; = angular frequency in rad/s 7ft = zero shear viscosity in Pa-s rn - viscous relaxation time in s a ~ breadth parameter n - power law parameter, fixed at 0.181 8<br>
Absolute Molecular Weight as Determined by Light Scattering<br>
Molecular weight data were determined using SEC-MALS, which combines the methods of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with multi-angle light scattering (MALS) detection. A DAWN EOS 18-angle light scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) was attached to a PL-210 SEC system (Polymer Labs, UK) or a Waters 150 CV Plus system (Milford, MA) through a hot transfer line, thermally controlled at die same temperature as the SEC columns, and. its differentia] refractive index (DRI)<br>
detector (145 °C). At a flow rate setting of 0.7 raL/rnin, the mobile phase, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), was eluted through three, 7.5 mm x 300 mm, 20 urn Mixed A-LS columns (Polymer Labs). Polyethylene (PE) solutions with concentrations of -1.2 mg/mL, depending on samples, were prepared at 150 °C for 4 h before being transferred to the SEC injection vials sitting in a carousel heated at 145 °C. For polymers of higher molecular weight, longer heating times were necessary in order to obtain true homogeneous solutions. In addition to acquiring a concentration chromatograrn, seventeen light-scattering chromatograms at different angles were also acquired for each injection using Wyatt's Astra® software. At each chromatographic slice, both the absolute molecular weight (M) raid root mean square (RMS) radius, also known as radius of gyration (RJ were obtained from a Debye plot's intercept and slope, respectively. Methods for this process are detailed in Wyatt, P.J., Anal. Chim. Acta, 272, 1 (1993), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The linear PE control employed was a linear, high-density broad MWD polyethylene sample (Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.). The weight average molecular weight (Afw), number average molecular wei^it (A/n), z-average molecular weight (AQ and molecular weight distribution (Mw/A/,,) were computed from mis date, and are presented in various Tables.<br>
The Zimm-Stockmayer approach was used to determine the amount of LCB in ethylene polymers. Since SEG-MALS measures M and #g at each slice of a chromatograrn simultaneously, the branching indices, gM, as a function of M could be determined at each slice directly by determining the ratio of the mean square Jf, of branched molecules to that of linear ones, at the same M, as shown in equation 1:<br>
where the subscripts br and lin represent branched and linear polymers, respectively.<br>
At a given §•«• the weight-averaged number of LCB per molecule (B3w) was computed using Zimm-Stoclonayer's equation, shown in equation 2, where the branches were assumed to be trifunctional, or Y-shaped.<br><br>
In<br><br>
(2)<br><br>
LCB frequency ( LCBM, }, the number of LGB per 1 000 C, of the f* slice was then computed straightforwardly using equation 3:<br>
I(3w-l-000*14*Ba/M      .	(3)<br>
where Mi is the MW of the P slice. The LCB distribution across the molecular weight distribution (LCBD). was thus be established for a full polymer.<br>
A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution Instrument" was used to detennined specific surface area ("surface area") and specific pore volume ("pore volume1'). .This instrument was acquired from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N.Y.<br>
Preparation of a Fluorided Silica-Alumina Activator-Support<br>
The silica-alumina used to prepare the fluorided silica-alumina acidic activator-support in this Example Was typically Davison silica-alumina obtained from W.R. Grace as Grade MS13-110, containing 13% alumina, having a pore volume of 1.2 ce/g and a surface area of 400 m2/g. This material was fluorided by impregnation to incipient wetness with a solution containing ammonium bifluoride in an amount sufficient to equal 10 wt % of the weight of the silica-alumina. This impregnated material was then dried in a vacuum oven for 8 hours at 100°C. The thus-fluorided sih'ca-alumina samples were then calcined as follows. 10 grams of the alumina were placed<br>
in a 1.75-inch quartz tube fitted with a sintered quartz disk at the bottom. While the silica was supported on the disk, dry air was blown up through the disk at the linear rate of 0.045 to 0.051 cubic meter per hour (1.6 to 1.8 standard cubic feet per hour). An electric furnace around the quartz tube was used to increase the temperature of me tube at the rate of 400°C per hour to a final temperature of 500°C. At this temperature, the silica-alumina was allowed to fluidize for three hours in the dry air. Afterward, the silica-alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere.<br>
Metallocene Preparations<br>
All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents and materials were performed under nitrogen by using standard Schlenk line or dry box techniques. The solvent THF was distilled from potassium, while anhydrous diethyl ether, methylene chloride, pentane, and toluene (Fisher Scientific Company) were stored over activated alumina. All solvents were degassed and stored under nitrogen, Zirconium(IV) chloride (99.5%) and n-butyllithium were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and were used as received. Products were analyzed by *H NMR (300 MHz, CDd3, referenced against residual CHC13 peak at 7.24 ppm) or UC NMR (75 MHz, CDC13, referenced against central line of CDG3 at 77.00 ppm).<br>

EXAMPLES 1-5<br>
Comparative Catalytic Runs Varying the Metallocene, Activator-Support, and Pendent Athene of the Metallocene<br>
Examples 1-5 in Table 1 illustrate ethylene polymerization runs performed in a one-gallon autoclave reactor at 100°C, with two liters of isobutane diluent and triisobutylaluminurn or triethylaluminum cocatalyst. No hydrogen or comonomer was added. Ethylene was fed on demand to maintain the specified pressure for the specified length of the polymerization run (Table 1). ,4/wa-Metallocene solutions were usually prepared by dissolving 20-25 mg of metallocene in a mixture of 0-5 ml/ of 1-hexene, 0-5 mL of 1 M TIB A (Aldrich) or TEA (AKZO), and 15-25 mL of heptane.<br>
In cases where no precontactjng was used, or precontacting was earned out in the reactor, the reactor was typically charged with TEA or TffiA, an aliquot of the metallocene solution, and the solid oxide. All materials were added through a charge port while venting isobutane. One method of charging catalyst to the reactor was to charge TEA or TDBA, solid-oxide, and an aliquot of the metallocene solution through a charge port while venting isobutane.<br>
After the allotted polyrnerizatfon' time, the ethylene flow was stopped, and the reactor slowly depressurized and opened to recover a granular polymer. In all cases, the reactor was clean with no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling. The polymer was then removed and weighed. Activity was specified as grams of polymer produced per gram of solid oxide compound charged per. hour ((g/^/hr).<br>
The polymerization reaction was carried out in a 1-gallon autoclave as follows. The appropriate solutions, including any stock precontacted solutions, were charged to the autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, and 2 liters of isobutane were added along with any 1-hexene used. Stirring was<br><br>
initiated and maintained at 700 rpm as the reactor was heated to the reactor run temperature over a period of 5 minutes. The total pressure was brought to the desired reactor run pressure with with emylene, and ethylene was fed to the reactor on demand to maintain the desired pressure. After the polymerization run time, the stirrer and heating were then stopped and the reactor was rapidly depressurizcd. The autoclave was then opened and the solid polyethylene was physically removed.<br>
