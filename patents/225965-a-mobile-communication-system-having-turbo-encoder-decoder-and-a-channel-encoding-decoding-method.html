TURBO ENCODING/DECODING DEVICE AND METHOD FOR<br>
PROCESSING FRAME DATA ACCORDING TO QoS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a device and method for<br>
encoding/decoding a channel data in a mobile communication system, and in<br>
particular, to a device and method for encoding/decoding a channel data using a<br>
turbo code.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
An encoder using a turbo code (hereinafter, referred to as a turbo<br>
encoder) encodes an N-bit input frame into parity symbols using two simple<br>
parallel concatenated codes, wherein an RSC (Recursive Systematic<br>
Convolutional) code is generally used as a component code.<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 illustrate structures of a conventional parallel turbo<br>
encoder and decoder, which are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,446,747 by<br>
Berrou incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional<br>
turbo encoder. The turbo encoder of FIG. 1 includes a first constituent encoder<br>
12, a second constituent encoder 14 and an interleaver 16 interconnected<br>
therebetween. For the first and second constituent encoders 12 and 14, an RSC<br>
encoder can be used, which is well known in the art. The interleaver 16 has the<br>
same size as a frame length of the input data (i.e., N bits), and decreases the<br><br>
correlation of the input data bitstream dk provided to the second constituent<br>
encoder 14. Therefore, the parallel concatenated codes for the input data<br>
bitstream, dk, become xk (i.e., dk without modification), and ylk, and y2k the<br>
outputs of the first 12 and second 14 constituent encoders.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional<br>
burbo decoder. The turbo decoder includes an adder 18, subtracters 20 and 22,<br>
a soft decision circuit 24, delays 26, 28 and 30, and MAP (Maximum A<br>
Posterior Probability) decoders 32 and 34. The turbo decoder further includes<br>
an interleaver 36 which is identical to the interleaver 16 of FIG. 1, and<br>
deinterleavers 38 and 40. The turbo decoder repeatedly decodes data received<br>
by the frame unit using a MAP decoding algorithm, thereby increasing a bit<br>
error rate (BER). For implementation of turbo decoder SOVA (Soft output<br>
viterbi algorithm) could be used instead of said MAP decoding algorithm.<br>
The utilization of interleaver 16 of the turbo encoder of FIG. 1 implies<br>
that encoding and decoding should be performed as a frame unit. Accordingly,<br>
it can be appreciated thatthe required memory and calculations required for the<br>
MAP decoders 32 and 34, shown in FIG. 2 are proportional to a value obtained<br>
by multiplying the frame size by a number of states of the first and second<br>
constituent encoders 12 and 14 of FIG. 1.<br>
In a mobile communication system, voice and data are transmitted at a<br>
data rate of several Kbps to several Mbps, and a frame length of data input to a<br>
channel encoder may vary from several ms (milliseconds) to several hundred ms.<br>
For example, in the case where the data is transmitted at a data rate of over<br>
32Kbps. The number of data input to the turbo encoder is larger due to high data<br>
rate, the turbo decoder requires more memory and calculations to decode the<br>
received data. The turbo encoder shows a property that an error correction<br>
performance is enhanced as the frame length of the input data becomes longer,<br><br>
however increasing the memory and calculations required in a decoder.<br>
In addition, if the length of the input frame is too short e.q., less than<br>
8kbps/10 ms, the interleaver 16 in the turbo encoder cannot sufficiently increase<br>
the correlation among the input data, thereby deteriorating the error correction<br>
performance. That is, when the frame length of the input data is longer (or input<br>
data rate is high), the turbo encoder structured as shown in FIG. 1 and the turbo<br>
decoder structured as shown in FIG. 2 require a lot of calculations andmemory<br>
to perform encoding and decoding. Otherwise, when the frame length of the<br>
input data is shorter or the data rate of input data is lower, the turbo encoder<br>
may exhibit lower performance results, as compared with a convolutional<br>
encoder or a concatenated encoder (convolutional encoder + RS encoder),<br>
thereby increasing the BER.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to decrease the required calculations and<br>
memory capacity required for decoding by appropriately varying the processing<br>
size of the data input to the turbo encoder, independent of the data rate for the<br>
corresponding service, while fully securing the high BER required in the<br>
communication system.<br>
According to the present invention, as embodied and broadly described<br>
herein, a channel encoding/decoding apparatus is provided including a first<br>
constituent encoder for encoding data bits of a super frame or plurality of sub<br>
frames, an interleaver for interleaving the data bits of the super frame or sub<br>
frames, and a second constituent encoder for encoding the interleaved data bits<br>
of the super frame or sub frames. The second constituent encoder is coupled to<br>
the output of the interleaver.<br>
The channel encoding/decoding apparatus can be used as part of a base<br>
station or mobile station. The novel turbo encoder would be included as part of<br><br>
a channel transmitter in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The turbo<br>
encoer makes a determination as to whether to segment one input frame into<br>
several sub frames or assemble several input frames into one super frame.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a channel<br>
encoding device and method for variably encoding input data frames to sub or<br>
super frames of appropriate length according to QoS(quality of service) of data<br>

frame or high data rate into multiple sub framesto be encode d, and for<br>
separately decoding the divided encoded sub frames and then recombining the<br>

channel encoding/decoding device and method for combining short input frames<br>
or low data rate into a super frame having an appropriate length to encode the<br>
assembled super frame, decoding the assembled encoded super frame and then<br>
recombining the decoded super frame into the original frames.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a turbo<br>
channel encoding/decoding device and method for determining an optimal<br><br>
length of the sub/super frames by analyzing a quality of service (QoS) such as<br>
frame length, time delay tolerance, error tolerance, receiver complexity<br>
(especially receiver memory), a data rate correspondence to a service type of<br>
input frame data to be transmitted, and segmenting or combining an input data<br>
frame into sub or super frames according to the determination.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br><br>
description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
Communication systems of the future will have capabilities for providing<br>
a plurality of services with varying QoS (Quality of Service) characteristics, and<br>
QoS parameters including a time delay, BER, and frame error rate<br>
(FER)Services may be generally divided into high error rate services and low<br>
error rate services. Those services which can be provided with a high error rate<br>
include: voice service which requires a relatively short time delay, and a short<br>
message service (SMS) which permitsa long time delay. On the other hand,<br>
services requiringa low error rate include: a video conference service requiring<br>
a short time delay, and a still image or Internet file transfer service allowing a<br>
relatively longer time delay. Further, the same service may have different time<br>
delays and data rates.<br>
For example, in the image service for transmitting and receiving moving<br>
picture information, a data rate is 32-2048Kbps and a permissible time delay is<br>
in the range of 10-400ms: the data rate and the permissible time delay can be,<br>
however, varied according to a number of criteria including: a class of the user<br>
or terminal using the service, a class of the base station providing the service or<br>
a channel condition during the corresponding service. In a CDMA mobile<br>
communication system in particular, since the output power of a base station or<br>
a mobile station is limited, it is inadequate to increase a transmission power of<br>
only a certain user for a high quality service. This is because when the<br>
transmission power of the specific user is increased, interference to other users<br>
will increase in proportion to the increased transmission power. Therefore, there<br>
is a demand for a method capable of providing various multimedia services with<br>
reduced interference to the other users by minimizing an increase in the<br>
transmission power.<br><br>
In another example, a short frame packet data transmission service<br>
requires a low data rate and a very low error rate. However, if the time delay is<br>
out of the question, it is reasonable to decrease the error rate even though the<br>
time delay is somewhat increased. Therefore in this invention provide super<br>
frame concept.<br>
In the meantime, the turbo encoder, for forward error correction, shows<br>
a property that the bit error rate (BER) or the frame error rate (FER) are varied<br>
according to the data size of frame (the number of data bits to be processed in a<br>
time) determined by length of the input data frame and data rate. The turbo<br>
encoder consists of constituent encoders having a short constraint length,<br>
however, the error correction capability is improved as the correlation between<br>
the data input to the respective constituent encoders is decreased, due to the<br>
existence of the interleaver in the turbo encoder. The correlation between the<br>
data input to the respective constituent encoders becomes lower, as the data size<br>
of frame input to the turbo encoder becomes much more. Therefore, an increase<br>
in the frame length of the input data improves the error correction capability.<br>
However, an increase in length of the input frame causes an increase in the time<br>
delay at the encoder and the decoder.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a configuration of a channel transmitter including a<br>
turbo encoder according to an embodiment of the present invention. The turbo<br>
encoder shown in FIG. 3 segments one input frame into several sub frames or<br>
assembles several input frames into one super frame by counting bits of the<br>
input user data in accordance with provided message information, and thereafter<br>
encodes the segmented or assembled frames with a turbo code to transmit the<br>
encoded frames via a transmission channel. The term message information<br>
as used herein refers to information about the QoS, i.e., service type, rate of data<br>
such as voice, character, image and moving picture data, size of the input data<br>
frame, permissible delay, and permissible error. The message information is<br><br>
exchanged between a base station and a mobile station during a call setup and<br>
the exchange of the message information is continued till termination of the<br>
corresponding service. Further, predetermined information between the base<br>
station and the mobile station predetermined during the call setup can also be<br>
varied during the corresponding service by data exchanging. That is, the<br>
message information including information representing the size of the frame to<br>
be processed in the turbo encodercan be reset according to a rate of the data to<br>
be serviced. For example, when 10ms frame data is serviced at a data rate of<br>
2048Kbps, one data frameconsists of 20480 bits. In this case, the turbo encoder<br>
according to the present invention segments (or divides) the 10ms frame into<br>
10/4ms subframes and then, turbo encodes four 5120-bit subframe and then<br>
recombining four encoded sub frame into 10 ms frame for channel interleaving..<br>
The turbo decoder then decodes the four encoded subframes and recombines<br>
them into one 20480-bit 10 ms frame.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a channel transmitter including a turbo<br>
encoder according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, user data (UD) is received by a source data encoder<br>
42. The user data UD has a data rate of over several tens of Kbps, such as<br>
character, image and moving picture data, as distinguished from voice data<br>
having a much lower data rate on the order of several Kbps. The source data<br>
encoder 42 encodes the received user data UD by the fixed length frame whose<br>
length is determined in accordance with the service type and then provides the<br>
encoded fixed length frame data to an input of a bit counter 50. For example,<br>
the source data encoder 42 typically encodes voice data with a 10ms frame<br>
format, character data with a 20ms frame format, image data with an 80ms<br>
frame format, and moving picture data with a 40ms frame format, and provides<br>
the respective encoded data into the bit counter 50. The processing size can be<br>
different with respect to data rate or frame length. The frame length unit can be<br><br>
fixed 10 ms or fixed 20 ms. A central processing unit (CPU) 46 transfers<br>
information about the QoS, i.e., service type of the user data to be transmitted<br>
(e.g., voice, character, image or moving picture) and the data rate to a message<br>
information receiver 108 of FIG. 6 via a message information transmitter 44.<br>
The channel transmission device of FIG. 3 can be equally applied to both the<br>
base station and the mobile station.<br>
Although the present invention is described with reference to an<br>
embodiment which transmits the message information to the decoder using a<br>
separate transmitter, it is also possible to transmit the data size information by<br>
loading it in a head area of a transmission frame during data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the CPU 46 reads, from a frame segment/assemble<br>
information storage unit 48, QoS information including information about<br>
service type of data to be transmitted, corresponding data rate, permissible delay,<br>
permissible error rate (BER or FER) and frame length, and information about<br>
service class of the base station or the mobile station. Next, the CPU 46 makes<br>
a determination to segment the received frame and therefore must also<br>
determine the size and number of the segmented frames, using the read<br>
information. Alternatively, when constructing a super frame, the CPU 46 may<br>
determine to assemble the required frames and therefore must also determine<br>
the number of frames to be assembled, using the read information. Based on the<br>
determination, the CPU 46 provides a frame segment/assemble control signal<br>
and an interleaving mode signal to the bit counter 50 and a programmable<br>
interleaver 52, respectively, to perform turbo encoding. That is, according to the<br>
QoS of the data to transmit, the CPU 46 determines how many consecutive<br>
input frames should be assembled to generate a super frame, or alternatively<br>
determines the number of sub frames which will be generated by segmenting<br>
one input frame. The turbo encoder then turbo encodes data bits of the super<br>
frame or data bits of the respective sub frames. As previously stated, the QoS<br><br><br>
may include input frame length, user data rate, permissible delay, permissible<br>
error rate, etc. The size of the input frame can be determined based on input<br>
frame length and user data rate.<br>
In determining whether to segment or assemble the frames by the CPU<br>
46, the following criteria are considered.<br>
In general, for transmittingpacket data, the mobile communication<br>
system uses a low data rate of below several tens of Kbps, with a transmission<br>
delay from several tens to several hundeds ms (milliseconds) and requires a<br>
BER on the order of 10-2-10-4. For example, if the output frame of the source<br>
data encoder 42 is 10ms long and a permissible delay time permitted in the<br>
turbo encoder is 40ms, it is possible to assemble four 10ms frames output from<br>
the source data encoder 42 into one super frame, which will be input to the<br>
turbo encoder. Therefore, the error rate of assembled packet data can be<br>
decreased.<br>
For transmitting character, image and moving picture data, the mobile<br>
communication system has a permissible transmission delay from several tens<br>
ms to several hundreds ms and requires a BER of 10-6-10-7. The performance<br>
of the turbo encoder is increased as the frame length of the input data is<br>
enhanced. However, additional calculations and memory is required in the<br>
turbo decoder. There is a trade off between performance and decoder<br>
complexity. In case of the packet data service, for example, it is possible to<br>
satisfy both the required BER and moderate decoder complexity by enabling the<br>
CPU 46 to generate a sub/super frame control signal for segmenting/combining<br>
the output data from the source data encoder 42, of M-bit length, into sub/super<br>
frames of N-bit length.<br>
That is, the frame segment/assemble information storage unit 48 stores<br><br><br><br>
frame segment/assemble information for increasing the length N of the<br>
sub/super frame for a service requiring the low BER and for decreasing the<br>
length N of the sub/super frame for a service requiring a short time delay and a<br>
high BER. The CPU 46 reads the frame segment/assemble information from the<br>
frame segment/assemble information storage 48 according to the service type<br>
and the frame length of the input data.<br>
Segmenting/combining the frames input to the turbo encoder can be<br>
more readily appreciated from the following example. Assume a frame size of<br>
the data input to the turbo encoder is 20480 bits/10ms, for a low BER service<br>
having a data rate 2048 Kbps. In the mobile station providing the above service,<br>
the turbo decoder requires a memory capacity which is proportional to 20480<br>
bits multiplied by number of soft decision bits. An increase in the memory<br>
capacity of the mobile station causes an increase in complexity and cost of the<br>
mobile station.<br>
However, in the service having a data rate of 2048Kbps/10ms, if the<br>
channel encoder divides (i.e., segments) a frame input to the turbo encoder into<br>
four sub frames (i.e., 10ms/4) and encodes the sub frames, and a turbo decoder<br>
in the channel decoder then decodes the sub frames and recombines the decoded<br>
sub frames into the original frame, the turbo decoder requires a memory<br>
capacity which is proportional to 5120 bits by the number of soft decision bits,<br>
thereby causing a reduction in the required memory capacity.<br>
Furthermore, for a low BER (e.q. 10-6 - 10-7) service having a low data<br>
rate of 32Kbps/10ms, each data frame input to the turbo encoder will consist of<br>
320 bits. If encoding is performed at a data rate of 32Kbps/80ms (i.e., each<br>
frame consists of 2560 bits), the time delay is somewhat increased, as compared<br>
with the case where turbo encoding is performed at the data rate of<br>
32Kbps/10ms (i.e., each frame consists of 320 bits). However, it is possible to<br><br><br><br>
decrease the BER for the same signal-to-noise ratio (Eb/No) or decrease the<br>
Eb/No value for the same BER, thereby increasing the overall system capacity.<br>
In the mobile communication system, not all the users or mobile stations<br>
are provided with the same degree of services. Instead, the available data rate is<br>
limited according to the user class, the mobile station or the base station. In<br>
addition, the available data rate may be limited due to the memory capacity<br>
determined according to the class of the respective mobile stations. Accordingly,<br>
when the data rate is variable from 32Kbps to 2048Kbps according to the<br>
service type (or service option) and the permissible time delay also varies from<br>
10ms to 400ms, the device according to the present invention can vary the<br>
length of the frames input to the turbo encoder according to the class of the user<br>
or mobile station, the class of the base station, service type or the channel<br>
condition while satisfying the required error rate of the corresponding service.<br>
For example, when the channel conditions is bad, the device according to the<br>
present invention can satisfy the error rate required by a corresponding service<br>
by increasing the length of the frames input to the turbo encoder and thereby<br>
permitting an increase in the time delay rather than increasing the transmission<br>
power.<br>
The frame segment/assemble information which is the message<br>
information being exchanged between the base station and the mobile station,<br>
has information about the size of the frames to be encoded/decoded, wherein the<br>
frame size may be determined according to the user data rate, input frame length,<br>
permissible delay permissible error rate and the channel condition, etc.<br>
The bit counter 50 counts N bits of the input data according to an N-bit<br>
frame segment/assemble control signal output from the CPU 46, and provides<br>
the counted N bits to the programmable interleaver 52 and first and second input<br>
buffers 54 and 56. The bit counter 50 also generates a bit count termination<br><br><br><br>
signal to the CPU 46 whenever it counts N bits of the input data. Therefore, it<br>
can be appreciated that the bit counter 50 segments or assembles the input<br>
frames into sub or super frames having a specific length, under the control of<br>
the CPU 46 which uses the QoS information, such as the service type and the<br>
data rate of the input data, stored in the frame segment/assemble information<br>
storage 48, and provides the sub or super frames to the programmable<br>
interleaver 52 and the first and second input buffers 54 and 56.<br>
An interleaving processor 72, a component of the programmable<br>
interleaver 52, reads interleaving parameters from an interleaving parameter<br>
storage 70 according to an interleaving mode control signal output from the<br>
CPU 46 to process the read interleaving parameters, and provides the processing<br>
result to an interleaving address mapper 74. Here, the CPU 46 provides the<br>
interleaving processor 72 with the following interleaving information.<br>
First, in the case where a turbo interleaver having a single interleaving<br>
method is used as the interleaver 52, optimal parameter values are provided as<br>
the interleaving information. The optimal parameter values are determined to<br>
have the highest performance according to the length of the data information<br>
bits sequence to be interleaved. The parameter values can be determined by<br>
experimentally obtained value.<br>
Second, in the case where a turbo interleaver having one or more<br>
interleaving methods is used as the interleaver 52, optimal parameter values are<br>
provided as the interleaving information and are determined to have the highest<br>
performance through experiments according to the length of the information bits<br>
for interleaving and the variable length of the interleaver in the corresponding<br>
interleaving mode. For example, in the case where the required transmission<br>
delay time is short and the input data frame of the turbo encoder (i.e., the output<br>
data frame of the source data encoder 42) is small in size (or length), a uniform<br><br><br><br>
interleaver such as a block interleaver or a cyclic shift interleaver is used for the<br>
interleaver 52. Otherwise, in the case where the required transmission delay<br>
time is relatively long and the input data frame is large in size, a non-uniform<br>
interleaver such as a random interleaver is used for the interleaver 52. From the<br>
foregoing description, it could be appreciated that various interleavers can be<br>
used according to the size of the data to be interleaved.<br>
The interleaving address mapper 74 receives either sub or supOer frames<br>
of N-bit length segmented or assembled by the bit counter 50 the interleaving<br>
address mapper 74 maps the input bits to the interleaved input data buffer<br>
address corresponding to the interleaving processing result so as to perform<br>
interleaving, and provides the first interleaved sub or super frame data to an<br>
interleaved input data buffer (ILIB) 78 in the first buffer 54 alternately provide<br>
the second interleaved sub or super frame data to an ILIB 90 in the second<br>
buffer 56.<br>
The first and second input buffers 54 and 56 each include two input<br>
switches, two output switches, an input data save buffer (IDSB) with input and<br>
output ports connected to ones of the input and output switches, and the ILIB<br>
with input and output ports connected to the other ones of the input and output<br>
switches. In the drawing, reference numerals 76 and 88 denote IDSBs, reference<br>
numerals 78 and 90 denote ILIBs, reference numerals 80, 84, 92 and 96 denote<br>
input switches, and reference numerals 82, 86, 94 and 98 denote output switches.<br>
All the switches are controlled by the CPU 46. The switches 80, 82, 84 and 86<br>
in the first input buffer 54 operate as a mirror image in alternation with the<br>
switches 92, 94, 96 and 98 in the second input buffer 56. That is, input switches<br>
80 and 84 in the first input buffer 54 are in the ON state and the output switches<br>
82 and 86 are in the OFF state, while the input switches 92 and 96 in the second<br>
input buffer 56 are in the OFF state and the output switches 94 and 98 are in the<br>
ON state.<br><br><br><br>
Accordingly, when the bit counter 50 counts N bits of the input data<br>
under the control of the CPU 46, the data output from the bit counter is first<br>
stored in the IDSB 76 in the first buffer 54 through the input switch 80 which is<br>
initially in the ON state. At this moment, the counted data bits output from the<br>
bit counter 50 are interleaved by the programmable interleaver 52 and then<br>
stored in the ILIB 78 in the first input buffer 54 through the switch 84. If the bit<br>
counter 50 generates a bit count termination signal for the sub/super frame of N-<br>
bit length, the CPU 46 then repeats the above procedure after switching the first<br>
input buffer 54 to an output state and the second input buffer 56 to an input state.<br>
As a result, the next N bits counted from the bit counter 50 and the interleaved<br>
data from the programmable interleaver 52 are stored in the IDSB 88 and the<br>
ILIB 90 in the second input buffer 56, respectively.<br>
During this operation, a first RSC (RSC1) 58 and a second RSC (RSC2)<br>
60 receive the N-bit sub/super frame data and the corresponding interleaved<br>
data output from the IDSB 76 and ILIB 78 in the first input buffer through the<br>
output switches 82 and 86, respectively, and then performs turbo encoding by<br>
the N-bit frame unit in the same manner as the turbo encoder of FIG. 1.<br>
Next, when the N-bit frame data is completely stored in the second input<br>
buffer 56, the first input buffer 54 is again switched to the input state and the<br>
second input buffer 56 to the output state. Therefore, the RSC1 58 and the<br>
RSC2 60 turbo encode the data which are alternately output by the N-bit frame<br>
unit from the first and second input buffers 54 and 56.<br>
The turbo encoded bits from the RSC1 58 and the RSC2 60 are<br>
multiplexed by a multiplexer 62 and then interleaved by a channel interleaver 64.<br>
In the case where the several input frames are assembled into one super frame<br>
and the data is turbo encoded by the super frame unit, the channel interleaver 64<br><br><br><br>
performs channel interleaving by the super frame unit as shown in FIG. 4. On<br>
the other hand, when one input frame is segmented into several sub frames and<br>
the data is turbo encoded by the sub frame unit, the channel interleaving is<br>
performed by the input frame unit as shown in FIG. 5. That is, the channel<br>
interleaver 64 performs channel interleaving by combining the output symbols<br>
of the turbo encoder, encoded by the super frame or sub frame unit, as large in<br>
size as the input frame. The interleaved data is modulated by a modulator 66<br>
and then transmitted through a transmission channel 68.<br>
Thus, the novel channel transmission device shown in FIG. 3 assembles<br>
the input data frames into super frames to increase the bit number N when a low<br>
BER is required from an analysis of the QoS information such as the user s<br>
service type (e.g., voice, character, image and moving picture). Otherwise,<br>
when a low decoder complexity is required, the novel channel transmission<br>
device segments the input data frame into subframes to decrease the bit number<br>
N per frame. In this manner, the channel transmission device can maximize the<br>
efficiency of the turbo encoder/decoder.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram for explaining the operation of the invention, wherein<br>
the frames are assembled at a low or medium data rate and then turbo encoded.<br>
For example, a parameter J can be varied from 1 to 8 according to the number of<br>
the frames to be assembled. In the turbo encoder, the bit number of an input<br>
data frame, which is determined by multiplying the bit number of original frame<br>
by the frame number, J, may be limited depend on user data rate and decoder<br>
complexity.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram for explaining operation of the invention, wherein a<br>
frame dataprovided at a high data rate is segmented and then turbo encoded. A<br>
parameter I can be varied from 1 to 4 according to the number of the segmented<br>
sub frames. Likewise, in the turbo encoder, the bit number of an input data<br><br><br><br>
frame, which is determined by a value obtained by dividing the bit number of<br>
original frame by the number, I, of the segmented sub frames, may be limited<br>
depend on user data rate and permissible error rate.<br>
The data on the transmission channel transmitted by the turbo channel<br>
encoder of FIG. 3 is decoded into the original data by the turbo channel decoder<br>
of FIG. 6, which is more fully described from the following description.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the turbo channel decoder configuration according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The turbo channel decoder of FIG. 6<br>
counts bits of the user data input by the N-bit sub frame unit according to<br>
message information to decode the input user data and thereafter, assembles the<br>
decoded data into frames having the original length, thereby recombining the<br>
user data.<br>
When the user data consists of b N-bit super frame, the turbo decoder<br>
decodes the input user data and thereafter segments the decoded data into<br>
frames having the original length, thereby segmenting the user data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, upon receiving a frame of N-bit length through the<br>
transmission channel 68, a demodulator 100 demodulates the received frame<br>
data and provides the demodulated data to a channel deinterleaver 102. The<br>
channel deinterleaver 102 descrambles the demodulated data frame and applies<br>
it to a demultiplexer 104, which demultiplexes the multiplexed data symbols<br>
and parity symbols and provides the demultiplexed symbols to a bit counter 106.<br>
Here, a message information receiver 108 receives message information<br>
regarding the service type of the user and the data rate that the message<br>
information transmitter 44 of FIG. 3 has transmitted, and provides the received<br>
message information to a CPU 112.<br>
The CPU 112 analyzes the message information provided from the<br><br><br><br>
message information receiver 108 and reads frame segment/assemble<br>
information from a frame segment/assemble information storage 110 according<br>
to the analysis. Also, the CPU 112 analyzes the interleaving information<br>
included in the message information and provides an interleaving mode signal<br>
and a parameter value to an interleaver and a deinterleaver in a turbo decoder<br>
116 according to the analysis, thereby performing turbo interleaving. In addition,<br>
when the receiving data is sub frame (actually the received data is a original<br>
frame size but the frame is encoded by sub frame unit), the CPU 112 outputs an<br>
N-bit frame segment control signal before turbo decoding and a frame<br>
recombine control signal after turbo decoding according to the read message<br>
information. Here, the information stored in the frame segment/assemble<br>
information storage 110 is similar to that stored in the frame segment/assemble<br>
information storage 48 of FIG. 3.<br>
When the receiving data is super frame, the CPU 112 controls turbo<br>
decoder to decode the received frame as it is and then a frame segmenting<br>
control signal after turbo decoding according to the read message information.<br>
The bit counter 106 consecutively provides the data output from the<br>
demultiplexer 104 to a frame buffer 114 by the N-bit sub frame unit according<br>
to the N-bit frame segment control signal. Switches 126 and 132 in the frame<br>
buffer 114 are initially in the ON state and the other switches 128 and 130 are<br>
initially in the OFF state.<br>
Therefore, the counted data bits output from the bit counter 106 are<br>
initially stored in a first N-frame buffer (N-FB1) 122. Upon completion of<br>
storing the N-bit data output from the bit counter 106 in the N-FB1 122, the bit<br>
counter 106 generates an N-bit count termination signal. Upon detecting the N-<br>
bit count termination signal, the CPU 112 turns off switches 126 and 132 in the<br>
frame buffer 114 and turns on the other switches 130 and 128. Then, the N-bit<br><br><br><br>
data output from the bit counter 106 is stored in a second N-frame buffer (N-<br>
FB2) 124. At this moment, the received data stored in the N-FB1 122 is<br>
decoded by a turbo decoder 116 having the same structure as that of FIG. 2.<br>
Accordingly, under the control of the CPU 112, the N-FB1 122 and the<br>
N-FB2 124 in the frame buffer 114 alternately receive and store the data output<br>
by the N-bit unit from the bit counter 106, and the stored data is decoded by the<br>
turbo decoder 116. When user data decoded by sub frame unit, the decoded data<br>
output from the turbo decoder 116 is recombined into the frames of the original<br>
length by a frame recombiner 118 which is controlled by the CPU 112, and then<br>
output as the user data through a source data decoder 120.<br>
In summary, the turbo decoder 116, broadly described, receives a super<br>
frame consisting of multiple frames or multiple sub frames segmented from a<br>
frame, and turbo decodes the received frames. The frame recombiner 118, under<br>
the control of the CPU 112, recombines, when user data decoded by sub frame<br>
unit the output of the turbo decoder 116 into the original frames in response to<br>
information about the frame size and number of the frames constituting the sub<br>
frames or information about the number of the sub frames segmented from the<br>
input frame and the size of the sub frames.<br>
The frame recombiner 118, under control of the CPU 112 segments when<br>
user data decoded by super frame unit, the output of the turbo decoder 116 into<br>
the original frames in response to information about the frame size and number<br>
of the frames constituting super frame.<br>
Another aspect of this invention, the turbo encoder of the present<br>
invention also includes a method in which any one of the bit counter 50 and the<br>
buffers 54 and 56 for interleaving, shown in FIG. 3, is not required. In the<br>
frame combining operation, the data bits are sequentially stored in the memory<br><br><br><br>
(i.e, buffer 54 or 56) for interleaving the number of the frames to be assembled.<br>
Data bits are sequentially output to the RSC1 in the turbo encoder in quantities<br>
equivalent to the number of non-interleaved assembled frames size. Data bits<br>
are output to the RSC2 in quantities equivalent to the number of assembled<br>
frame size which are interleaved according to the addresses of the interleaving<br>
address mapper generated by the interleaving processor.<br>
In another exemplary method, in the frame segmenting operation, the<br>
input data bits are sequentially stored in the memory for interleaving. Data bits<br>
are sequentially output to the RSCl in the turbo decoder in quantities equivalent<br>
to the size of the segmented frame size. Data bits are interleaved to the RSC2<br>
and output in quantities equivalent to the size of the assembled frame size.<br>
Accordingly, the turbo channel encoder of FIG. 3 and the turbo channel<br>
decoder of FIG. 6 assemble input data frames into a super frame to encode and<br>
decode the input frames by the super frame unit when the input data frames are<br>
too short, and segment an input frame into multiple sub frames to encode and<br>
decode the input frame by the sub frame unit when the input frame is too long,<br>
to increase transmission efficiency.<br>
As described above, the embodiment of the present invention<br>
segments/assembles input frames into sub/super frames of an appropriate length<br>
when the input data frame is very long or short, and then encodes and decodes<br>
the sub/super frames. In this manner, it is possible to reduce the number of<br>
required calculations and memory capacity required in the decoder, while fully<br>
securing the performance of the turbo code encoder.<br>
