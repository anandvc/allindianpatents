Background of the Invention<br>
Several patents and publications disclose processes for preparing cephalosporin compounds by condensing the appropriate 7-ACA derivative with respective thiazole group.<br>
US patent number 4,409,214 discloses a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) which comprises halogenating the compound of formula<br><br>
US patent 4,767,852 discloses a process for the preparation of cephems by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate (MAEM). Similarly, US Pat.No.5,026,843 (1991) discloses a process for preparing ceftriaxone disodium hemiheptahydrate by acylation of ACT (name) using MAEM as acylating agents in good yield and quality.  Thus MAEM has become the standard acylating agent for<br><br>

Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Cephalosporin derivatives of the general formula (I), in good yields with high purity.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (II), using the Cephalosporin derivatives of the general formula (I).<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide novel intermediates of the formula (VI), (VII) (VIII) and (IX), which are useful in the preparation of cephalosporin derivatives.<br>
