				<td>The present invention relates to a process for enhancing storability of<br>
seeds and marker gene therefor. More particularly this invention relates to a<br>
technique for enhancing storability of seeds under varying climatic conditions,<br>
specifically in tropical and sub-tropical conditions.<br>
That seed storability is a varietal or genetic character came to be known<br>
only from germination studies. Cell molecular events associated with deterioration<br>
of germination characteristics of seeds have so far been studied only in single<br>
varieties and no broad-based studies have yet been undertaken. From a scrutiny<br>
of recorded data and observations it has been found that cell deterioration is<br>
associated with cell molecular/enzymatic damages. Since enzymatic activity is<br>
precluded in stored seeds that generally exhibit around 10-12% moisture content<br>
(m.c), which is normally accepted as non-congenial for enzymatic changes, cell<br>
damage/deterioration observed in enzymes would be the effect rather than the<br>
cause of seed deterioration. Under such circumstance, it would be logical to<br>
explore possibilities of non-enzymatic cell damage towards understanding the<br>
mechanism of cell damage and protection from spontaneous UV radiation that<br>
affect seed during post harvest storage.<br>
As mentioned earlier, seed storability is a generic trait. After fresh<br>
harvest, a seed is at its maximum vigour in relation to its germination potential.<br>
From that time onwards cells of the embryonic axis undergo gradual cell<br>
molecular deterioration until the seed is rendered non-viable, i.e. the seed fails to<br>
germinate. The rate at which loss of germination potential takes place, mainly<br>
due to cellular senescence, varies rather widely in different varieties. However,<br>
studies undertaken till date do not provide an understanding of genetic (varietal)<br>
control of storability trait of seeds.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
enhancing storability of seeds.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a process in which there<br>
is used a marker gene for achieving enhanced storage stability of seeds.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to identify DNA fragments<br>
incorporated in seeds resulting in vigour trait in seeds, e.g. in rice varieties.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which<br>
provides a process for enhancing storage stability of seeds and marker gene<br>
therefor comprising in combination -<br>
(a) identifying DNA fragments by using RAPD technique for ascribing<br>
seeds with seed vigour trait, and<br>
(b) cloning and sequencing the DNA fragment which was found to match at<br>
around 94% similarity level with Acetyl Co A carboxylase in maize.<br>
The DNA fragment as aforesaid has been found to match at around &gt;90%<br>
level in some other monocots and dicots.<br>
In the present invention cell molecular events associated with post<br>
harvest seed aging has been studied in a number of seed varieties. Studies<br>
involving cell molecular events associated with seed vigour have been used for<br>
regression analysis (ANOVA) test to identify the aforesaid DNA fragment.<br>
It is to be noted that reduction and eventual loss in germination potential<br>
on prolonged storage of seeds results in loss of large amounts of plant genetic<br>
resource in the form of planting materials. Solving the problem of seed storability<br>
and seedling vigour (manifested by early germination) is of major importance for<br>
developing sustainable agriculture. A process to enhance storage life of seeds<br>
would help to reduce large losses in seed material, particularly where cold and<br>
dry seed storage facility is lacking.<br>
Development of a DNA marker for enhancing storage - stability is likely<br>
to be treated as a major achievement in -<br>
(i) routine germplasm screening to select seed varieties with high storability,<br>
(ii) incorporating high storability trait into other elite seed varieties through,<br>
(a) breeding procedures associated with marker assisted selection, and<br>
(b) plant transformation protocols, also using marker-assisted selection<br>
of parent and progeny, as and when necessary.<br>
Studies on the mechanism by which Acetyl Co A carboxylase present in<br>
high copy number in some varieties has yielded extremely encouraging results by<br>
conferring higher storage stability in various seed varieties.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to the<br>
specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the .art that<br>
various changes and modifications can be made without deviating or departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein<br>
includes within its ambit the obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
The present invention relates to a marker DNA fragment capable of<br>
enhancing storability of seeds and process therefore. More particularly this invention<br>
relates to the identification of a gene responsible for determining seed storability in<br>
orthodox seeds during post harvest storage specifically in tropical and sub-tropical<br>
condition, i.e. a DNA marker gene capable of being used for selection of varieties with<br>
high seed vigour storabiliti trait.<br>
That seed storability is a varietal or genetic character came to be known<br>
only from germination studies. Cell molecular events associated with deterioration of<br>
germination characteristic of seeds have so far been studied only in a single variety at a<br>
time and no broad-based study has yet been reported. From a scrutiny of recorded data<br>
and observation it has been found that seeds deterioration is associated with cell<br>
molecular/ enzymatic damages. Since enzymatic activity is precluded in stored seeds that<br>
generally exhibit around 10-12% moisture content (m. c), which is normally accepted as<br>
non-congenial for enzymatic changes, cell damage/ deterioration observed in aged seeds<br>
would not be due to degradative enzymes; such damages would be the effect of storage<br>
environment, viz. UV radiation rather than the cause of seed aging. Under such<br>
circumstance, it would be logical to explore possibilities of non-enzymatic cell damage<br>
with an aim to understand the mechanism of cell damage and protection from<br>
spontaneous UV radiation that affect seed during post tharvest storage. .<br>
As mentioned earlier, seed storability is a genetic trait. After fresh<br>
harvest, a seed is at its maximum vigour in relation to its germination potential. From that<br>
time onwards cell of the embryonic axis undergo gradual cell molecular deterioration<br>
until the seed is rendered non-viable, i.e. the seed fails to germinate. Varieties that<br>
produce seeds of low vigour are the ones with low seed storability trait. The rate at which<br>
loss of germination potential takes place, mainly due to cellular senescence, varies rather<br>
widely in different varieties. However, studies undertaken till date do not provide an<br>
understanding of genetic (varietal) control of storability trait of seeds.<br>
The primary aim of the present invention is to provide a DNA marker<br>
that may be used as a probe for selecting varieties possessing high Seed storability trait<br>
The nucleotide/ DNA sequence of the marker DNA fragment is given below:<br><br>

A further object of this invention is to provide a process in which there is used a<br>
marker gene for achieving enhanced storage stability of seeds.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to identify DNA fragments incorporated in<br>
seeds resulting in high storability trait in seed, e.g. in rice varieties.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for enhancing storability of seeds<br>
and relevant gene therefor, having a partial sequence of DNA fragment of the said gene as<br>
given above, which comprises-<br>
(a) identifying DNA fragments by using RAPD technique for ascribing seeds with high<br>
seed stability trait, and<br>
(b) cloning and sequencing the DNA fragments which was found to match at around<br>
96%-94% similarity level with Acetyl CoA Carboxylase in wheat.<br>
The foregoing process leads to development of enhanced stability of orthodox (rice)<br>
seeds by making use of the marker DNA fragment to select appropriate germplasm for use<br>
as donor in plant transgenic/plant breeding programmes.<br>
The DNA fragment as aforesaid has been found to match at around &gt;90% level in<br>
some other monocots and dicots, e.g. rice, wheat, maize, jowar, bajra, gram, etc.<br>
The DNA sequence compared to available gene sequences in the literature on the<br>
basis of distribution of BLAST hits on query sequence has been shown in Fig. 1 of the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
In the present invention cell molecular events associated with post harvest seed<br>
aging has been studied in a number of varieties. Studies involving cell molecular events<br>
associated with seed storability have been used for regression analysis (ANOVA) test to<br>
identify the aforementioned DNA fragment associated with varieties exhibiting high<br>
vigour trait.<br>
In this context it may be mentioned that Acetyl Co A Carboxylase is a housekeeping<br>
enzyme generally participating in the lipid biosynthesis, e.g. Acetyl CoA -»Malonyl CoA,<br>
which is essential for cell membrane turnover/biosynthesis. During maturation associated<br>
programmed dehydration of cells, the main said enzyme gets diverted to the secondary<br>
metabolic pathway whereby they produce flavonoids in plants. Even though these are<br>
generally coloured compounds, colourless flavonoids are known to exist in plants, viz. in<br>
seeds, showing an absorption maxima (Amax) between ~280nm and 320nm, i.e. in the UV<br>
wavelength region. These compounds thus effectively serve as UV screens, practically<br>
debarring entry of UV radiation into seeds. This is particularly realized in dry stored seeds<br>
since at the moisture content level of around 8-10% by wt. prevailing in seeds, enzymatic<br>
repair is precluded; this leads to accumulation of UV induced cell damage that causes the<br>
damaging effect of UV to be exaggerated. Flavonoids also serve as non-enzymatic anti-<br>
oxidants for scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are capable of functioning<br>
in dry, mature seeds.<br>
It has been possible to establish through assay of gene-product that presence of<br>
high copy no. of the aforesaid gene in seed of some varieties of rice (orthodox seed)<br>
enhances seed storage ability. Presence of band at ~902bp in RAPD analysis using OP-<br>
AC 19 primer representing a DNA segment of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase gene, as revealed<br>
by BLAST analysis shows around 94% similarity with cytosolic Acetyl CoA Carboxylase<br>
and 96% similarity with plastid Acetyl CoA Carboxylase in Triticum aestivum. Adequate<br>
support is rendered to the above proposition by the data from the curves shown in Fig.2 of<br>
the drawings, wherefirom it may be established the activity of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase<br>
enzymes (i.e. product of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase gene) is more efficient in binding to/<br>
reacting with substrate Acetyl CoA in varieties that exhibit the aforementioned ~902bp<br>
fragment in RAPD analysis. Incidentally these are the varieties exhibiting higher storage<br>
ability of seeds.<br>
Thus, an overexpression of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase due to high copy number is<br>
responsible for high seed storability in orthodox seeds like rice-this is confirmed by the<br>
foregoing studies. Varieties that exhibit this band are also found to exhibit high vigour at<br>
the germination stage, lending credence to the age-old observation that storability is a<br>
function of high vigour status in seeds. In other words, varieties mat exhibit high vigour of<br>
seeds are the ones that show high storability under natural aging. Low vigour varieties<br>
exhibit appreciably low germination percentage after 1-2 years of natural aging. Some low<br>
vigour varieties have even been found to show no germination at all in the course of such<br>
aging, i.e. after 1-2 years, where as high vigour varieties retain &gt;50% germination even<br>
after 2 years of aging.<br>
The aforesaid gene may be accessed or selected from a genomic library or<br>
depository NCIB under Accession No. AJ 549091 by use of the marker DNA fragment<br>
identified above. This followed by incorporation of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase gene onto the<br>
genome of low-vigour varieties for enhancing gene copy number in those low storable<br>
varieties with the object of increasing the seed storability status in these varieties by<br>
transgenic means.<br>
Turning to the drawings accompanying this specification,<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the DNA sequence of the ~902bp fragment.<br>
Fig. 2 shows Vo-vs-[S] curves, where Vo is reduction of absorbance at 340nm and [S] is<br>
varying substrate Acetyl CoA Carboxylase concentration.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts by means of histogram germination potential of seeds of varying ages.<br>
In Fig. 2, the reduction of absorbance is akin to more production of the product<br>
NAD* at initial time, i.e. at initial 1 minute change. High vigour varieties A, B and C have<br>
low Km [Michalis-Menton constant], and also higher affinity with substrate Acetyl CoA<br>
in comparison to low vigour varieties D, E and F having higher Km values. The data<br>
showing the higher efficiency of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase gene product, i.e. Acetyl CoA<br>
Carboxylase enzyme lends support to the proposition that varieties A, B and C (which<br>
show high storage capacity) possess higher copy number of this gene compared to varieties<br>
D, E and F that are poor seed stores. In these graphs, 0-subscript bis been used for<br>
unaged rice seeds.<br>
In Fig. 3 there is shown germination ability of seeds, on the basis of percentage of<br>
seeds germinated after 120 hours following one and two years of aging under natural<br>
(ambient) conditions resulting in natural aging and consequent reduction in germination<br>
capability. The subject study has taken into account the germination of seeds of different<br>
varieties and in the histogram "O"-subscript has been used for unaged seeds, 1 for one-<br>
year aged seeds and 2 for two-year aged seeds.<br>
It is to be noted that reduction and eventual loss in germination potential<br>
on prolonged storage of seeds result in loss of large amounts of plant genetic resource.<br>
Solving the problem of seeds storability and seedling vigour (manifested by early<br>
germination) is of major importance for developing sustainable agriculture. A process to<br>
enhance storage life and germination potential of seeds would help to reduce large losses<br>
in seed material, particularly where cold and dry seed storage facility is lacking. Plant<br>
breeding/ plant transformation protocols that could introduce more copy numbers of this<br>
gene into low storers, i.e. seeds of low storage capability, would thus be able to enhance<br>
seeds(storability)even in such low storers.<br>
Development of a DNA marker for enhancing storability of germination<br>
potential of seeds is likely to be looked upon as a major achievement in- <br>
1. routine germplasm screening to select seed varieties with high storability with an<br>
aim to<br>
(a) saving cost of seed purchase every year and<br>
(b) perpetuating elite varieties even if sowing is not possible for regeneration<br>
in some years;<br>
2. incorporating high storability trait into other elite seed varieties by means of<br>
(a) breeding procedures connected with marker associated selection and<br>
(b) plant transformation protocols, also using marker associated selection of<br>
parent and progeny, as and when necessary.<br>
Further more, it has been rendered possible to use the presence of this<br>
fragment (namely, Acetyl CoA Carboxylase) as a means of screening rice germplasm<br>
available in the wild or from breeding progenies to select appropriate variety as in Marker<br>
Associated Selection (MAS) for cultivation or for breeding purpose as in<br>
marker-assisted breeding. This will also render it possible to develop a simple<br>
diagnostic kit for germplasm screening purpose.<br>
 While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to<br>
specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various<br>
changes and modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its<br>
ambit the obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
Having described the invention in detail with particular reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, it will now be more specifically defined by means of claims<br>
appended hereafter.<br>
