Quaternary ammonium compounds for froth flotation of silicates from an iron ore<br>
The present invention relates to a froth flotation process in which silicates are separated from an iron ore in the presence of a collector containing a quaternary ammonium compound having two aliphatic groups and/or acyl groups containing 6-14 carbon atoms. This collector has a high selectivity to concentrate silicates in the froth product, while a high yield of iron minerals is maintained in the bottom concentrate or concentrates.<br>
Quaternary ammonium compounds are often utilised as collectors in froth flotation processes. Thus, it is described in WO 94/26419 to subject a calcite mineral to a froth flotation process in the presence of a mixture containing a quaternary compound and an alkylene oxide adduct of an alkylamine, as a collector component. WO 97/26995 describes the use of esterquats as flotation agent for nonsulphidic minerals. The quaternary ammonium compounds contain acyl groups of 6-24 carbon atoms. In the working examples esterquats of not defined nature, dicocoalkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride or trimethyl tallow ammonium chloride are used as collectors for silicate-rich calcite ores with enhanced content of magnesium. US 3 960 715 relates to a froth flotation process for separating siliceous gangue constituents from an iron ore performed in the presence of a cationic collector including quaternary amines, such as dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride.<br>
The article "Cationic Flotation of Silica From Magnetic Iron-Ore Concentrates": H.C. Hedberg, MAOCS, U7 (1970: 5, 177-179), compares the effect of different cationic collectors. The tests show that the quaternary ammonium compounds, trimethyl coco ammonium chloride, trimethyl lauryl ammonium chloride and trimethyl tallow ammonium chloride were not as efficient as coco primary amine acetate used as a standard.<br><br>
The US Patent 4 995 998 discloses the use of fatty-alcohol polyglycol ethers terminally blocked by hydrophobic radicals as co-collectors together with cationic or ampholytic surfactants in the flotation of non-sulfidic ores. In Example 4, pure quartz sand is subjected to a froth flotation process in the presence of a lauryl trimethyl ammonium chloride.<br>
Although these flotation processes have positive effects, there is a clear tendency that the enriched iron mineral either contains a too high silicate level (often essentially over 1% by weight) or a too low iron yield. Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to develop a more selective froth flotation process resulting in a high yield of iron at a low silicate content. Another objective of the invention is to obtain the improved flotation at a low dosage of the collector.<br>
According to the present invention it has been found that these objectives can be achieved by carrying out a reversed froth flotation process at a pH of 7-11 of an aqueous suspension of a silicate-containing iron ore in the presence of a depressing agent of the iron mineral and a quaternary ammonium compound having the formula<br>
R1R1N+R3R4  1/z Xz~	(I),<br>
in which the groups Ri  independently are hydrocarbon groups, preferably aliphatic groups containing 6-14 carbon atoms and/or the group R2~(OR7)m " °^B"f   where the groups R2 independently are acyl groups containing 6-14 carbon atoms, the groups R7 independently are alkylene groups containing 2-4 carbon atoms, the groups Ra independently are alkylene groups containing 2-3 carbon atoms and m is a number from 0-5, R3 and R4 independently are alkyl groups containing 1-4 carbon atoms or groups (RsO)p, where the groups R5 independently are alkylene groups having 2-4 carbon atoms and p is c number from 1-4, X is an anionic group, and z is the charge of the anion X, the amount of the quaternary ammonium compound being 10-500 milligram per kg iron ore.<br><br>
Preferably the groups Rx are straight aliphatic groups containing 6-10 carbon atoms or branched aliphatic groups containing 8-13 carbon atoms and the groups R2 are straight acyl groups containing 6-10 carbon atoms or brancned acyl groups containing 8-13 carbon atoms.<br>
These quaternary ammonium compounds having two comparatively small aliphatic groups and/or acyl groups exhibit even at low dosages an unexpected high selectivity for silicates and leave an iron-containing concentrate of high purity and a very low content of silicates. The quaternary ammonium compounds are preferably added in an amount of 15-200 milligram per kg iron ore, and most preferably in an amount of 15-100 milligram per kg iron ore.<br>
Since the froth product from the rougher flotation may contain considerable amounts of iron minerals, the froth product may be subjected to tine or more, for example from 1 to 5, additional froth flotation steps (cleaning steps) after adding water and if desired, a complementary addition of the quaternary ammonium compound, the depressing agent and/or other flotation chemicals. Normally, it is not necessary to make any supplementary addition of the collector. The bottom concentrate from the rougher flotation and the bottom concentrates from the subsequent froth flotation steps of the froth products are suitably combined to a final concentrate having high yield of iron and a very low content of silicates.<br>
Preferred quaternary ammonium compounds are those, where the groups R5, R7 and R3 are the -C2H4- group and at least one of the groups R3 and R4 is an alkyl group, preferably the methyl group. These compounds are easy to produce and have excellent properties. The groups Rx are preferably n-octyl, n-decyl, 2-propylheptyl and/or methyl substituted alkyl groups having 9-13 carbon atoms. The groups R2 are preferably 2-ethylhexanoyl, n-octanoyl, 2-propylheptanoyl and methyl-substituted acyl groups containing 9-13 carbon atoms. The anionic group X is suitably a halogenide, such as chloride; an alkyl sulphate, such as methyl sulphate;<br><br>
hydrogen sulphate; or a carboxylate, such as acetate. The quaternary ammonium compounds used in the flotation process are well known and there exists a comprehensive literature disclosing the methods of their preparation.<br>
In the flotation process according to the invention, the iron ore can be ground together with water to the desired particle size. As a rule, at least 50% by weight of the ground ore has a particle size between 5 and 200 jum. The ground ore is then suspended in water, and fine material is deslimed in conventional manner, for instance, by screening, settling or cycloning. Thereafter, an aqueous water slurry (pulp) is prepared from the deslimed ore and a depressing agent for the iron ore is normally added. The depressing agent could be a hydrophilic polysaccharide, e.g. starch, such as corn starch activated by treatment with alkali and dextrin. Other examples of suitable hydrophilic polysaccharides are cellulose derivatives, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, sulphomethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose; hydrophilic gums, such as gum arabic, gum karaya, gum tragacanth and gum ghatti; alginates; and starch derivatives, such as carboxymethyl starch and phosphate starch. The depressing agent is normally added in an amount of about 10 to about 1000 g per tonne of ore. Besides, alkali is usually added in an amount sufficient to obtain a pH of 7-11, preferably 9-11. After conditioning of the pulp, the quaternary ammonium compounds can be added and the mixture is further conditioned for a while before the froth flotation is carried out. If desired, froth-regulating means can be added on a convenient occasion before the froth flotation. Examples of suitable froth-regulating additives are methyl isobutyl carbinol and alcohols having 6-12 carbon atoms which optionally are alkoxylated with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide.<br>
The Examples below further illustrate the present invention.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
A hematite ore containing about 13.1% by weight of Si02 and about 85,9% by weight Fe203 was ground to such a particle size that 4 5.4% by weight passed a screen having a<br>
mesh opening of 32 |im. Then the ore was suspended in water and deslimed by a hydrocyclone, and an aqueous pulp of the deslimed ore was prepared with a dry content of 60%. After addition of 500 mg of starch treated with alkali per kg ore the pulp was conditioned for 5 minutes. The concentration of ore in the pulp was then reduced by addition of water to 40%, the pH-value of the pulp adjusted to 10.5 and a collector added in the amounts stated in table 2. The whole mixture was then conditioned for 60 seconds followed by rougher flotation, whereby a silicate-rich froth product and an iron-rich bottom concentrate were obtained. The froth product was cleaned by means of a second flotation step (cleaning step) without any additions of collectors or other additives and the bottom concentrate from the cleaning step was added to the bottom concentrate from the rougher flotation. This cleaning process was repeated one or three times and the bottom concentrate from the rougher flotation and the bottom concentrates from the different cleaning steps were combined. The bottom concentrate from the rougher flotation and the different combined bottom concentrates were analysed with respect to the yield of iron (Fe203) and the content of silicate (Si0 2) - The results are shown in table 2 below.<br><br><br><br>
From the results it is evident that the collectors according to the invention have a strong affinity and high selectivity for silicates. By repeated cleaning of the froth product it is also possible to obtain a combination of the bottom concentrates with an excellent yield of Fe203 and a very low content of Si02 in comparison with the prior art. Furthermore, the amounts of the collectors needed to perform the froth flotation process are astonishingly low.<br>
Example 2<br>
An hematite ore containing 24.1% by weight of Si02 and about 73.6% by weight Fe2C&gt;3 was ground to such a particle size that 27.2% by weight passed a screen having a mesh opening of 32 /urn. An aqueous suspension of the material ground was then prepared in the same manner as in Example 1. The iron ore suspensions were subjected to rougher flotations, which were followed by one or more cleaning steps of the froth products. In the cleaning processes no supplementary addition of flotation chemicals was made. The bottom concentrate from the rougher flotation and the different combined bottom concentrates were analysed with respect to the total yield of iron (Fe203) and the content of silicate (SiQ2) . The results obtained are shown in Table 4 below.<br><br><br>
The flotation results are similar to the results in Example 1. The collectors according to the invention have a strong affinity and selectivity for silicates already at a low dosage, especially the collectors having short chain aliphatic or acyl groups.<br><br><br>
