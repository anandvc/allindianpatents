				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an improved apparatus for the continuous crystallization of a substance from a solution, using vacuum pan and more particularly, but not exclusively, to continuous crystallization of sugar from a solution in a vertical continuous vacuum pan.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION (PRIOR ART):<br>
Definition of important Terms:<br>
1.	Massecuite: (Pronounced = Mess-kit)<br>
It is a mixture of crystals and mother liquor discharged from a vacuum pan.<br>
2.	Calandria: Equipment consisting of closely spaced metal tubes for heat<br>
exchange.<br>
The present invention describes an improved apparatus for the continuous production of sugar. The apparatus consists of multiple vacuum chambers or operation chambers arranged vertically, one top of the other. The chambers perform the function of crystallization and evaporation. Each chamber is vertically connected to the next, so that sugar syrup after reaching a particular consistency on undergoing evaporation and crystallization in one chamber, moves to the next, where it undergoes further concentration due to evaporation and crystallization. The process continues in a sequential manner, so that the concentrated product ie. Massecuite is withdrawn from the last chamber. This massecuite is then processed further, to ultimately yield the final crystallized product i.e. sugar.<br>
Conventionally, instead of continuous process, batch process employing vacuum pan, was used. However, it had the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	Efficiency: Low efficiency of the crystallizer-evaporator due to all<br>
stages being performed in one vessel only;<br>
2.	Steam    consumption:     higher    both    quantitatively    and<br>
qualitatively;<br>
3.	Product quality: Slow and uneven growth rates.<br>
4.	Dead Time: It is the time during which one process is completed<br>
and the  next  has to be started.   Since,  the process  was<br>
discontinous, time gap had to be given to clean the vessel and<br>
make it operational for a fresh batch, resulting in 'dead time.'<br>
5.	Variable load: Fluctuating heating steam demand and variable<br>
vapour   pressure   requirements   resulting   in   higher   energy<br>
consumption, uneven load on boiler and condenser respectively,<br>
resulting in increased cost of production and lowered efficiency of<br>
operations.<br>
These disadvantages led to the development of continuous vacuum pans wherein process is carried out by continuously feeding the seed crystals and the sugar solution to an evaporator-crystallizer, while withdrawing the massecuite (highly concentrated suspension) from the evaporator-crystallizer. The continuous apparatus is of two types - vertical and horizontal. In the vertical type, the evaporating-crystallizing compartments are vertically arranged, one on top of the other. In the horizontal type, the same are connected horizontally to each other.<br>
The advantage of the horizontal continuous apparatus was that the average growth function of the crystals was improved, leading to better product quality. Various types of horizontal apparatus have been described in prior art. (Patent Nos. IN161506, IN170702, GB1049798, US3627582, DE2128031).<br>
possible with the use of stirrers. A reliable operation without stirrers (mechanical circulation) is not possible and may lead to sedimentation of the crystals (Austmeyer, K.E.; Schliephake, D.; Ekelhof, B.; Sittel, G. (1989): Zukerindustrie 114, 875-878). The use of lower pressure vapours becomes possible (e.g. coming from the 2nd or 3rd evaporator effect), allowing reduction in the factory steam requirements. Also there is less deposit on the tubes, due to the abrasion effect by friction of the circulating crystals. Those claiming rational circulation without the use of stirrers do so at the cost of simplicity of design and heat economy. (Indian Patent Nos. IN145885, IN169913 and Foreign Patent Nos. US4120745, EP0201629, DE3839182, FR2695837 and Patent Application No. IN/PCT/2002/02149/CHE).<br>
Sugar solution is transferred from one vessel to another in stages with a provision for by-passing a particular chamber by means of appropriate pipelines. Different types of stirrer-equipped vertical continuous apparatus for sugar manufacture have been described in prior art. (Patent Nos. EP0065775, FR2695837)<br>
Patent No. EP0065775 (DE3120732) describes an apparatus consisting of two or more chambers of a vacuum pan stacked one upon another wherein bottom of each chamber is surrounded by the passive steam of the chamber below. The preferred version has four superimposed chambers. The agitators of first flowed through chambers are implemented as high-speed mixing agitators and the agitators of the following chambers as rolling over agitators, arranged in each case, on a common shaft.<br>
Major advantages offered by such a system are:<br>
i.        Improvement    in    product   quality    due   to    reduction    in conglomeration and false grain formation.<br>
ii.       Homogenization of the massecuite is obtained.<br>
iii. Long Operating Cycle: The pan is available throughout the campaign without any total plant standstills, even for high-purity massecuites, thereby drastically reducing dead-time.<br>
iv. Optimum adaptation of crystallization chambers and stirrers (mechanical circulators) to process conditions.<br>
v.       Energy economy i.e. reduced operational costs.<br>
However, such an arrangement violates a fundamental feature of vertical continuous vacuum pans viz. stirrers mounted on a common shaft present a disadvantage when one of the chambers is taken out of operation for cleaning or other reasons.<br>
In order to overcome the said disadvantage, separately driven stirrers (circulators) for each evaporating-crystallizing chamber were introduced commercially, so that the process was not interrupted when any one chamber was taken out of operation for cleaning etc. This was achieved by introduction of intermediate sections between the chambers, in which were mounted stirrer (circulator) drives and gearbox with the circulator shaft extending through the top cover of each such vessel with a mechanical circulator (impeller) in the downtake. This design of the pan permitted retrofitting of a 5th chamber to increase its capacity. (Website of B.M.A. company - www.bma-de.com)<br>
Owing to differences in crystal retention times and consequently in crystal growth, there existed wide crystal size distribution. The underlying cause for it was the limited number of stirrer-equipped evaporating-crystallization chambers.<br>
Since the variation in crystal quality is caused due to limitations of processing owing to limited number of evaporating-crystallization vessels,<br>
an apparently simple solution to the problem would be to increase the number of vessels.<br>
In fact, initial thinking and attempts to make evaporating crystallization as a continuous process led to the recognition that because of the widening of the crystal size distribution, this objective could only be achieved if at least 8 chambers with stirrers (circulators) were arranged sequentially (Austmeyer, K.E. 1982; Zuckerindustrie 107, 401-414).<br>
Accordingly, it was first proposed to build a cascade of eight chambers with stirrers of which seven were to be in operation, while one was being cleaned. However, for economic reasons, this concept could not be implemented till date. Major problems associated with an increase in number of treatment chambers are as follows:<br>
1.	Increased height of the apparatus;<br>
2.	Stirrer shaft becomes very long, both in case of top mounted<br>
motor of the mechanical stirrer and in case of stirrers mounted on<br>
a common shaft.<br>
3.	Associated technical  problems:  e.g.  installation complexities,<br>
maintenance       problems,        increased       noise       levels,<br>
alignment/guidance requirements, etc.<br>
From the above, it is dear that though vertical type continuous apparatus offered distinct advantages over the horizontal system, it also had technical limitations regarding the number of stages which could be incorporated in a single apparatus.<br>
An alternative embodiment proposed in Patent No. EP0065775 with a multiplicity of chambers is, to build the vertical apparatus in the form of two-upright standing towers and to switch the chambers of the towers in such a way that the chambers of each tower are flowed through<br>
successively, from above downward. However, such a 'twin-tower' arrangement also has disadvantages.<br>
i)        It adds to energy requirements e.g. pumping and<br>
ii)       leads to decrease in overall performance and efficiency of the<br>
system besides the disadvantages mentioned above, iii)      Also there are problems associated with the bypassing of chambers in such an arrangement.<br>
The present invention has been able to overcome these disadvantages in a novel manner.<br>
A search of Indian patent databases reveals that no patent as for the present invention has been described in the prior art.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The principal object of the invention is to disclose an improved vertical apparatus in which problems of technical limitations and also economy associated with introduction of multiplicity of chambers in a fixed height have been overcome.<br>
Yet another object of the invention to provide an improved vertical continuous evaporation-crystallization apparatus, in which problems of poor crystal quality due to wide crystal size distribution, conglomeration and false grain formation are considerably reduced but economy of operation is maintained.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
A search of the prior art reveals that though it is highly desirable to have a single vertical continuous vacuum pan of eight chambers for optimum product quality, yet the same has not been implemented at commercial level, due to technical difficulties and economy. The existing apparatus in<br>
the state of the art consists of four or five stirrer equipped chambers arranged one on top of the other, occupying a total height of around 31 meters. In the present invention, within the approximately same height, instead of four or five chambers, eight chambers alongwith an additional storage/buffer tank, have been incorporated by using a novel approach. According to this approach, the intermediate space between the chambers which was housing the mechanical circulator drives and gearboxes, has been altogether eliminated without using common shafts for mechanical circulators (stirrers), by housing the drives in specially insulated pockets in the vapor space in each chamber. In addition, another novel approach has been adopted in making the drives bottom mounted, resulting in considerable reduction in shaft length, from 5.0-6.0 meters in existing apparatus to just 0.5-0.56 meters in the present invention, enabling easy installation and maintenance and resulting in power economy.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved vertical continuous vacuum pan comprising a cylindrical housing having a vertical axis in which plurality of vacuum chambers are stacked one above the other on a common axis characterized in that each chamber has a bottom mounted mechanical circulator housed in an insulated pocket in the vapour space segment of each chamber and not in additional space above the chamber enabling erection of at least eight operation vacuum chambers and a storage or buffer tank at top of the cylindrical housing, in the same height in which previously only 4 or 5 operation chambers were erected, thus eliminating the need for erecting two upright standing towers.<br>

pan according to the present invention;<br>
Fig.2 shows another view of section-elevation of Fig.1; and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention consists of an improved vertical continuous vacuum pan apparatus consisting of eight chambers and a storage tank at the top, within the existing conventional height (Fig.1 &amp; 2), characterized in that each chamber has a bottom mounted drive housed in an insulated pocket in the vapour space segment of each chamber and not in additional space above the chamber. As a result, the technical problems associated with multiplicity of chambers have been solved in the present invention. Increasing the number of compartments in a vertical apparatus has distinct advantages of increasing product quality, besides economy of operation. However economic limitations prevented the increase in height of the apparatus which could result in number of chambers being increased. Also, technical problems associated with the positioning, installation and maintenance of the stirrer (circulator) drives prevented an increase in the number of chambers within the same apparatus height.<br>
In the new invention, three major innovations have been carried out:<br>
1. Novel utilization of existing space to house stirrer (mechanical circulator) drives: In the present invention, instead of using additional space to house the mechanical circulator assembly, the existing vapor space in each chamber has been utilized to house the drives. This novel arrangement has been<br>
made possible by cutting an insulated pocket out of a segment of the vapour space of the lower operation chamber for fitting a bottom driven mechanical stirrer (circulator) in the upwardly tapering cone of the 'W'-shaped bottom in the floor of each operation chamber.<br>
As a result of this, at least 8 chambers have been erected with an additional storage or buffer tank at the top in approximately same height of around 31 meters in which previously only 4 or 5 chambers were erected. A significant improvement in product quality and throughput is achieved due to higher heating surface and net volume for an apparatus of similar dimensions. It also eliminates the need for erecting two upright standing towers thereby increasing the overall performance and efficiency of the system.<br>
2.	Altering   position   and   fitting   mechanism   of   the   stirrer<br>
(circulator) assembly: The bottom fitted stirrer (circulator) drive &amp;<br>
gearbox is a direct  mounted  in-line  planetary drive without<br>
coupling and much reduced shaft length, of only about 0.5m-<br>
0.56m as compared to the conventional shaft length of 5.0m-6.0m,<br>
thereby enabling easy installation, reducing power consumption,<br>
maintenance requirements, elimination of air leakages, thereby<br>
making the system compact and enhancing the overall efficiency<br>
of the system.<br>
3.	Elimination of a common shaft: Each compartment has its own<br>
stirrer (circulator) assembly, eliminating the need for a centrally<br>
mounted,   long  shaft,   which   made   maintenance   difficult.   In<br>
contrast, maintenance and cleaning in the present apparatus is<br>
much simple.<br>
As a result of these innovations, technical and economic problems which prevented the introduction of multiple chambers in an apparatus of fixed height have been overcome.<br>
The apparatus consists of:<br>
a cylindrical housing (1) having a vertical axis in which plurality of vacuum chambers (2) are stacked one above the other on a common axis (Fig. 1) each of the vacuum chamber (2) substantially having a 'W'-shaped bottom (3) with space below being surrounded by the passive steam of the chamber below; each operation chamber (2) having associated therewith a fixed set point control for condition of massecuite and discharge volume per hour and that the per hour discharge volume of a given operation chamber is greater than the per hour discharge volume of the immediately preceding operation chamber;<br>
a heat supply means comprising vertical tube fixed annular calandria (4) supplied by active heating steam from a common supply (5) external to the cylindrical housing;<br>
a central downtake (6) equipped with swirl breakers (7) and in which an axial flow impeller or a mechanical circulator (8) located in the downtake (6) of each operation chamber (2);<br>
one or more mechanisms for contrdling-<br>
a)	heating steam pressure,<br>
b)	vapour pressure,<br>
c)	massecuite condition,<br>
d)	feed syrup supply proportion and flow rate,<br>
e)	ratio of feed syrup to seed supply,<br>
f)	massecuite level, and<br>
g) transfer of massecuite from the upper to the lower pan and which transferring means include gravity discharge means;<br>
a massecuite discharge pipe (9) in the floor of every chamber (2) equipped with a control valve (10) regulated by a level sensor of the same chamber and connected to the massecuite supply pipe (11) of the next lower chamber opening in the downtake (6);<br>
a feed box (12) having valve-controlled inlets for seed crystals, feed syrup and hot water and connected to a common inlet pipe (13) out-flowing into massecuite supply pipe (11) in each chamber except the first (top) chamber where it outflows directly into the downtake (6), thereby reducing multiple inlets in each chamber and piping requirements;<br>
a means (14) for introduction of feed syrup in each chamber connected to a common syrup feed header (15) through a control valve regulated by a brix sensor, having an outlet in the feed box (12);<br>
a means (16) for continuously introducing seed crystals into the first operation chamber out-flowing into the feed box (12);<br>
an outlet means (17) for continuously withdrawing sugar syrup and product cystals from the last operation vacuum chamber (2);<br>
means for exhausting vapour and non-condensables through a common vapour line (18) connected to a condenser/vapour recompressor and also equipped with means for entrainment separation (19);<br>
means for removal of condensate (20);<br>
means for bypassing a particular operation chamber (2) by arrangement of appropriate pipes (21);<br>
vacuum break means (22);<br>
means for cleaning comprising valve-controlled steam supply line (23), hot &amp; cold water supply lines (24 &amp; 25) with a wash out drain line (26) connected to the massecuite discharge duct (9) in the floor of the chamber and regulated by a control valve, outflowing into a common wash out drain pipe (not shown).<br>
According to the most salient features of the present invention it will be observed that a novel approach has been adopted enabling erection of at least eight operation vacuum chambers (2) and a storage or buffer tank (27) at top of the cylindrical housing (1), in the same height in which previously only 4 or 5 operation chambers were erected, thus eliminating the need for erecting two upright standing towers thereby increasing the overall performance and efficiency of the system.<br>
This has been made possible by cutting an insulated pocket (28) out of a segment of the vapour space (29) of the lower operation chamber for fitting a bottom driven mechanical stirrer (circulator) in the upwardly tapering cone of the substantially 'W'-shaped bottom in the floor of each operation chamber. The insulated pocket has adequate space for enabling installation and maintenance works.<br>
The said bottom fitted mechanical stirrer (circulator), is a direct mounted in-line planetary drive (30) without coupling and much reduced shaft length, of only about 0.5m-0.56m, thereby enabling easy installation, reducing power consumption, maintenance requirements, elimination of air leakages, resulting in increase in overall efficiency of the system. This has been achieved by two factors:<br>
a.	Positioning: Positioning of the sealing means &amp; bearing assembly in a<br>
special sealing and bearing housing (31) disposed entirely within the<br>
vacuum pan operation chamber (2); and<br>
b.	Use of improved gear-box: use of compact &amp; light weight gearbox<br>
(32) of inline planetary type having a hollow spline output and hollow input<br>
with key arrangement for direct inline flange mounting of the drive. It is<br>
mounted directly onto the bottom of each operation chamber (2) without<br>
any coupling and support structure.<br>
Also, drives of lower ratings are installed in mechanical stirrers (circulators) of upper operation chambers than those installed in the last and/or lower operation chambers, without changing the design of the impeller (circulator) vanes, making the system further energy efficient.<br>
The sealing and bearing housing (31) is provided on its outside by an inverted cone (33). The advantage of the said inverted cone (33) is that it avoids stagnation areas adjacent to the housing (31) and assists in the circulation of the massecuite in the vacuum pan operation chamber (2). Further advantage of the inverted cone (33) is that it provides reinforcement to the sealing and bearing housing (31).<br>
An additional feature of the invention is that a storage tank (27) with chambers for syrup, hot water and cold water is mounted at the top of the cylindrical housing (1) i.e. above the operation vacuum chambers (2). It reduces the continuous pumping requirements, the storage tank acting as a buffer for continuous supply, again adding to efficiency of the system. The bottom of the said storage or buffer tank (27) is in the form of an inverted cone (34). The common feed syrup header (15), hot and cdd water headers (24 &amp; 25) are connected to their respective outlets from the storage or buffer tank (27).<br>
Another feature is, that entrainment separation means include very compact centrifugal type entrainment separators (19) with upper two operation chambers having 4 compact entrainment separators and other lower chambers having 3 compact entrainment separators. Use of light weight compact and multiple entrainment separators instead of a large one has the advantage of easy fabrication, installation and maintenance.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the uppermost or lowermost operation vacuum chamber may be used as a graining chamber. The said graining chamber operates at a higher strike level than the operation chambers.<br>
A significant improvement in product quality and throughput is achieved in the present invention due to increase in number of chambers within the same dimensions leading to higher heating surface and net volume, while maintaining the economy of operation.<br>
A comparison of the technical features of the present invention with the commercialized apparatus of a leading company is given below and is illustrative: Table<br>

**         (Website: www.bma-de.com).<br>
Due to reduction in retention time ratio with increase in number of compartments in the present invention, coefficient of variation is reduced i.e. sugar with a narrow range of particle size distribution can be produced.<br>
