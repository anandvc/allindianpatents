DESCRIPTION<br>
CARBURIZATION RESISTANT METAL MATERIAL<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a metal material that has excellent high-<br>
temperature strength and superior corrosion resistance, and in particular is used in a<br>
carburizing gas atmosphere containing hydrocarbon gas and CO gas. More particularly,<br>
it relates to a metal material having excellent weldability and metal dusting resistance,<br>
which is suitable as a raw material for cracking furnaces, reforming furnaces, heating<br>
furnaces, heat exchangers, etc. in petroleum refining, petrochemical plants, and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Demand for clean energy fuels such as hydrogen, methanol, liquid fuels (GTL:<br>
Gas to Liquids), and dimethyl ether (DME) is expected to significantly increase in the<br>
future. Therefore, a reforming apparatus for producing such a synthetic gas tends to be<br>
large in size, and an apparatus that achieves higher thermal efficiency and is suitable for<br>
mass production is demanded. Also, heat exchange for recovering exhaust is often used<br>
to enhance energy efficiency in reforming apparatuses in the conventional petroleum<br>
refining, petrochemical plants, and the like, and ammonia manufacturing apparatuses,<br>
hydrogen manufacturing apparatuses, and the like, in which raw materials such as<br>
petroleum are used.<br>
[0003]<br>
To effectively use the heat of such a high-temperature gas, heat exchange in a<br>
temperature range of 400 to 800°C, which is relatively low, has become important, and<br><br>
corrosion caused by carburization of a high Cr - high Ni - Fe alloy based metal material<br>
used for reaction tubes, heat exchangers, and the like in this temperature range poses a<br>
problem.<br>
[0004]<br>
Usually, a synthetic gas reformed in the above-described reactors, that is, a gas<br>
containing H2, CO, CO2, H2O, and hydrocarbon such as methane comes into contact with<br>
the metal material of a reaction tube and the like at a temperature of about 1000°C or<br>
higher. In this temperature range, on the surface of the metal material, elements such as<br>
Cr and Si, which have higher oxidation tendency than Fe or Ni or the like, are oxidized<br>
selectively, and a dense film of chromium oxide or silicon oxide or the like is formed, by<br>
which corrosion is restrained. In a portion such as a heat exchange part in which the<br>
temperature is relatively low, however, the diffusion of element from the inside to the<br>
surface of metal material is insufficient. Therefore, the formation of oxide film, which<br>
achieves a corrosion restraining effect, delays, and additionally, such a gas having a<br>
composition containing hydrocarbon comes to have carburizing properties, so that carbon<br>
intrudes into the metal material through the surface thereof, and carburization occurs.<br>
[0005]<br>
In an ethylene cracking furnace tube and the like, if carburization proceeds and a<br>
carburized layer comprising carbide of Cr or Fe or the like is formed, the volume of that<br>
portion increases. As a result, fine cracks are liable to develop, and in the worst case,<br>
the tube in use is broken. Also, if the metal surface is exposed, carbon precipitation<br>
(coking) in which metal serves as a catalyst occurs on the surface, so that the flow path<br>
area of the tube decreases and the heat-transfer characteristics degrade.<br>
[0006]<br>
In a heating furnace tube and the like for a catalytic cracking furnace for<br>
increasing the octane value of naphtha obtained by distillation of crude oil as well, a<br><br><br>
heavily carburizing environment consisting of hydrocarbon and hydrogen is created, so<br>
that carburization and metal dusting occur.<br>
[0007]<br>
On the other hand, in an environment in which the carburizing properties of gas in<br>
the reforming furnace tube, heat exchanger, and the like are severer, the carbide is<br>
supersaturated, and thereafter graphite precipitates directly. Therefore, a base material<br>
metal is exfoliated away and the thickness of base material decreases, that is, corrosion<br>
loss called metal dusting proceeds. Further, coking occurs with the exfoliated metal<br>
powder serving as a catalyst.<br>
[0008]<br>
If the cracks, loss, and in-tube closure increase, an apparatus failure or the like<br>
occurs. As a result, operation may be suspended. Therefore, careful consideration<br>
must be given to the selection of material used for an apparatus member.<br>
[0009]<br>
To prevent the aforementioned carburization and the corrosion caused by metal<br>
dusting, various countermeasures have conventionally been studied.<br>
[0010]<br>
For example, Patent Document 1 proposes an Fe-based alloy or a Ni-based alloy<br>
containing 11 to 60% (mass%, the same shall apply hereinafter) of Cr concerning the<br>
metal dusting resistance in an atmospheric gas of 400 to 700°C containing H2, CO, CO2<br>
and H2O. Specifically, it is shown that the invention of an Fe-based alloy containing<br>
24% or more of Cr and 35% or more of Ni, a Ni-based alloy containing 20% or more of<br>
Cr and 60% or more of Ni, and an alloy material in which Nb is further added to these<br>
alloys is excellent. However, even if a Cr or Ni content in the Fe-based alloy or the Ni-<br>
based alloy is merely increased, a sufficient carburization restraining effect cannot be<br>
achieved, so that a metal material having higher metal dusting resistance has been<br>
demanded.<br><br><br>
[0011]<br>
Also, in a method disclosed in Patent Document 2, to prevent corrosion caused by<br>
metal dusting of a high-temperature alloy containing iron, nickel, and chromium, one or<br>
more kinds of metals of the VIII group, the IB group, the IV group, and the V group of<br>
the element periodic table and a mixture thereof are adhered to the surface by the<br>
ordinary physical or chemical means, and the alloy is annealed in an inert atmosphere to<br>
form a thin layer having a thickness of 0.01 to 10 µm, by which the alloy surface is<br>
protected. In this case, Sn, Pb, Bi, and the like are especially effective. Although<br>
effective at the early stage, this method may lose effectiveness in that the thin layer is<br>
exfoliated in long-term use.<br>
[0012]<br>
Patent Document 3 relates to the metal dusting resistance of a metal material in an<br>
atmospheric gas of 400 to 700°C containing H2, CO, CO2 and H2O. As the result of an<br>
investigation of the interaction with carbon made from the viewpoint of solute element in<br>
iron, Patent Document 3 discloses that the addition of an element producing stable<br>
carbide in the metal material, such as Ti, Nb, V and Mo, or the alloying element in which<br>
the interaction co-factor Q represents a positive value, such as Si, Al, Ni, Cu and Co is<br>
effective in restraining metal dusting in addition to enhancing the protecting properties of<br>
oxide film. However, the increase of Si, Al and the like sometimes leads to the<br>
decrease in hot workability and weldability. Therefore, considering the manufacturing<br>
stability and plant working, this metal material leaves room for improvement.<br>
[0013]<br>
Next, to break off the contact of carburizing gas with the metal surface, there have<br>
been disclosed a method for oxidizing a metal material in advance and a method for<br>
performing surface treatment.<br>
[0014]<br><br>
For example, Patent Document 4 and Patent Document 5 disclose a method for<br>
pre-oxidizing a low Si-based 25Cr-20Ni (HK40) heat resistant steel or a low Si-based<br>
25Cr-35Ni heat-resisting steel at a temperature near 1000°C for 100 hours or longer in<br>
the air. Also, Patent Document 6 discloses a method for pre-oxidizing an austenitic<br>
heat-resisting steel containing 20 to 35% of Cr in the air. Further, Patent Document 7<br>
proposes a method for improving the carburization resistance by heating a high Ni-Cr<br>
alloy in a vacuum and by forming a scale film.<br>
[0015]<br>
Patent Document 8 proposes an austenitic alloy whose contents of Si, Cr and Ni<br>
satisfy the formula of Si 
high adhesiveness even in an environment, in which the alloy is subjected to a<br>
heating/cooling cycle, is formed to provide the alloy with excellent carburization<br>
resistance even in an environment in which the alloy is exposed to a corrosive gas at high<br>
temperatures. Patent Document 9 proposes an austenitic stainless steel having excellent<br>
scale exfoliation resistance even in an environment in which the steel is subjected to a<br>
heating/cooling cycle, which is produced by containing Cu and a rare earth element (Y<br>
and Ln group) therein and thereby forming a uniform oxide film having high Cr<br>
concentration in the film. Also, Patent Document 10 proposes a method for improving<br>
the carburization resistance by forming a concentrated layer of Si or Cr by performing<br>
surface treatment. Unfortunately, all of these prior arts require special heat treatment or<br>
surface treatment, and therefore they are inferior in economy. Also, since scale<br>
restoration (scale recycling) after the pre-oxidized scale or the surface treatment layer has<br>
exfoliated away is not considered, if the material surface is damaged once, the<br>
subsequent effect cannot be anticipated.<br>
[0016]<br>
Patent Document 11 proposes a stainless steel pipe having excellent carburization<br>
resistance and containing 20 to 55% of Cr, which is produced by forming a Cr-deficient<br><br>
layer, which has a Cr concentration of 10% or higher and lower than the Cr concentration<br>
of the base material, on the surface of steel pipe. In this patent document, however, the<br>
improvement of weldability, which is an issue of the Cu-containing steel, has not been<br>
studied.<br>
[0017]<br>
Besides, a method for adding H2S into the atmospheric gas has been thought of.<br>
However, the application of this method is restricted because H2S may remarkably<br>
decrease the activity of a catalyst used for reforming.<br>
[0018]<br>
Patent Document 12 and Patent Document 13 propose a metal material in which<br>
the gas dissociative adsorption (gas/metal surface reaction) is restrained by containing a<br>
proper amount of one kind or two or more kinds of P, S, Sb and Bi. Since these<br>
elements segregate on the metal surface, even if the elements are not added excessively,<br>
the elements can restrain carburization and metal dusting corrosion significantly.<br>
However, since these elements segregate not only on the metal surface but also at the<br>
grain boundary of metal grainy, a problem associated with hot workability and<br>
weldability remains to be solved.<br>
[0019]<br>
Techniques for enhancing corrosion resistance and crevice corrosion resistance by<br>
adding Cu have also been proposed. Patent Document 14 describes a technique for<br>
enhancing corrosion resistance by containing Cu, and on the other hand, for increasing<br>
the hot workability improving effect due to B by reducing S and O as far as possible.<br>
Patent Document 15 describes a technique for improving corrosion resistance and crevice<br>
corrosion resistance excellent in sulfuric acid and sulfate environments by setting the G.I.<br>
value (General Corrosion Index) represented by "-Cr + 3.6Ni + 4.7Mo + 11.5Cu" at 60 to<br>
90 and by setting the C.I. value (Crevice Corrosion Index) represented by "Cr + 0.4Ni +<br>
2.7Mo + Cu + 18.7N" at 35 to 50. Patent Document 16 describes a technique for<br><br><br>
improving hot workability by adding B exceeding 0.0015% while increasing a Cu<br>
content and by keeping an oxygen content low. In all of these techniques, the upper<br>
limit of a C content is restricted to a low level to avoid the decrease in corrosion<br>
resistance. Therefore, the solid-solution strengthening of C cannot be anticipated, and a<br>
sufficient high-temperature strength cannot be obtained. For this reason, these<br>
techniques are unsuitable for a metal material used at high temperatures.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0021]<br><br>
As described above, various techniques for enhancing the metal dusting resistance,<br>
the carburization resistance, and the coking resistance of metal material have been<br>
proposed conventionally. However, all of these techniques require special heat<br>
treatment and surface treatment, so that cost and labor are needed. Also, these<br>
techniques have no function of scale restoration (scale recycling) after the pre-oxidized<br>
scale or the surface treatment layer has exfoliated away. Therefore, if the material<br>
surface is damaged once, the subsequent metal dusting cannot be restrained. Also, these<br>
techniques have a problem associated with weldability of metal material.<br>
[0022]<br>
Also, there is a method for restraining metal dusting by adding H2S into the<br>
atmospheric gas in the tube of a reforming apparatus and manufacturing apparatus for<br>
synthetic gas as described above, not by improving the metal material itself. However,<br>
since H2S may remarkably decrease the activity of a catalyst used for reforming<br>
hydrocarbon, the technique for restraining metal dusting by adjusting the components of<br>
atmospheric gas is merely applied limitedly.<br>
[0023]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the present situation, and<br>
accordingly an object thereof is to provide a metal material that has metal dusting<br>
resistance, carburization resistance, and coking resistance, and further has improved<br>
weldability due to the restraint of reaction between carburizing gas and the metal surface<br>
in an ethylene plant cracking furnace tube, a heating furnace tube of catalytic reforming<br>
furnace, a synthetic gas reforming furnace tube, and the like.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0024]<br><br><br>
The inventors analyzed a phenomenon that carbon intrudes into a metal in a<br>
molecular state, and revealed that this phenomenon progresses in an elementary process<br>
consisting of the following items (a) to (c).<br>
[0025]<br>
(a)	Gas molecules consisting of C compounds such as hydrocarbon and CO<br>
approach the metal surface.<br>
[0026]<br>
(b)	The approaching gas molecules are dissociatively adsorbed onto the metal<br>
surface.<br>
[0027]<br>
(c)	The dissociated atomic carbon intrudes into the metal and diffuses.<br>
[0028]<br>
As the result of various studies on methods for restraining the aforementioned<br>
phenomenon, it was found that the following methods (d) and (e) are effective.<br>
[0029]<br>
(d)	Oxide scale is formed positively on the metal surface during the use of metal<br>
material, by which the contact with the metal of the gas molecules consisting of C<br>
compounds is broken off.<br>
[0030]<br>
(e)	The dissociative adsorption of the gas molecules consisting of C compounds is<br>
restrained on the metal surface.<br>
[0031]<br>
As the result that the study on oxide scale having a breaking-off effect as in the<br>
item (d) was conducted, it was revealed that oxide scale consisting of Cr and Si acts<br>
effectively. In particular, in a carburizing gas environment such as an ethylene plant<br>
cracking furnace tube, a heating furnace tube of catalytic reforming furnace, and a<br>
synthetic gas reforming furnace tube, the partial pressure of oxygen in gas is low.<br><br>
Therefore, it was revealed that oxide scale consisting mainly of Cr can be formed on the<br>
gas side and oxide scale consisting mainly of Si can be formed on the metal side by<br>
containing proper amounts of Cr and Si.<br>
[0032]<br>
On the other hand, as the result that the study was conducted from the viewpoint<br>
of dissociative adsorption as in the item (e), it was revealed that if proper amounts of<br>
noble metal elements such as Cu, Ag and Pt and elements of the VA group and the VIA<br>
group in the periodic table are added, an effect of restraining the dissociative adsorption<br>
of gas molecules consisting of C compounds is achieved. In particular, Cu is low in<br>
cost among the noble metal elements, and additionally less problems occur in melting<br>
and solidification when Cu is contained in an Fe-Ni-Cr based metal material. Therefore,<br>
the use of Cu is preferable.<br>
[0033]<br>
It was revealed that according to the methods (d) and (e), the intrusion of carbon<br>
into the metal in the above-described elementary process of items (a) to (c) can be<br>
restrained effectively, and by applying the methods (d) and (e) simultaneously, the metal<br>
dusting resistance, the carburization resistance, and the coking resistance can be<br>
improved dramatically.<br>
[0034]<br>
However, if an element such as Si and Cu is added, the corrosion resistance can<br>
be improved; on the other hand, the weldability is deteriorated. In particular, in a region<br>
subjected to an influence of heat cycle of rapid heating/rapid cooling caused by welding,<br>
that is in a welding heat affected zone (hereinafter, referred to as "HAZ"), cracks caused<br>
by grain boundary melting are liable to develop. Specifically, if Si, Cu or the like<br>
element segregates at the crystal grain boundary of the base material, the melting point of<br>
grain boundary lowers. At this time, when the grain boundary is subjected to welding<br>
heat cycle and is heated to a temperature just below the melting point, the grain boundary<br><br>
melts and is torn off by the thermal stress at the time of welding, which develops a crack.<br>
This is a HAZ crack. Therefore, in the case where the metal material is used for a<br>
welded structure, weld cracks of this kind must be restrained.<br>
[0035]<br>
The inventors studied various methods capable of restraining HAZ cracks at the<br>
time of welding while improving the corrosion resistance by adding a considerable<br>
amount of Si or Cu. As a result, the inventors came to obtain a knowledge that the HAZ<br>
cracks can be restrained by the following methods (f) and (g).<br>
[0036]<br>
(f)	Cr-based carbides are precipitated at the crystal grain boundary of the base<br>
material by increasing the C content, by which the melting point of grain boundary is<br>
raised.<br>
[0037]<br>
(g)	The grain coarsening in the HAZ at the time when the welding heat cycle<br>
occurs is restrained by the precipitation of Cr carbides of high melting point, by which<br>
the surface area of grain boundary is increased, and thereby the segregation of Si, Cu or<br>
the like at the grain boundary is decreased.<br>
[0038]<br>
Based on this knowledge, in a metal material containing 18 to 30% of Cr or 22 to<br>
30% of Cr, the contents, i.e. C, Si and Cu, were changed variously, by which the HAZ<br>
crack susceptibility was studied. As a result, it was revealed that the lower limit of C<br>
content capable of preventing HAZ cracks changes according to the Si, Cu and Cr<br>
contents. Specifically, it was revealed that as the Si and Cu contents lowering the<br>
melting point of grain boundary increase, the allowable lower limit of C content is raised,<br>
and as the Cr content constituting the carbides raising the melting point of grain<br>
boundary increases, the allowable lower limit of C content is lowered.<br>
[0039]<br><br>
From the results of systematical experiments in which components were changed<br>
variously, a relational expression between the C content capable of preventing HAZ<br>
cracks and the Si, Cu and Cr contents was estimated experimentally. As a result, the<br>
inventors obtained a knowledge that by satisfying Expression (1), both of excellent metal<br>
dusting resistance and excellent HAZ crack susceptibility resistance can be obtained.<br>

in which the symbol of element in Expression (1) represents the content of that element<br>
in mass%.<br>
[0041]<br>
The present invention has been completed based on the above-described<br>
knowledge, and the gists of the present invention are as described in the following items<br>
(1) to (3). Hereunder, the gists are called invention (1) to invention (3), and are<br>
sometimes generally named the present invention.<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0047]<br>
The metal material in accordance with the present invention has an effect of<br>
restraining reaction between carburizing gas and the metal surface, and has excellent<br>
metal dusting resistance, carburization resistance, and coking resistance. Further, since<br>
the weldability is improved, the metal material can be used for welded structure members<br>
of cracking furnaces, reforming furnaces, heating furnaces, heat exchangers, etc. in<br><br>
petroleum refining, petrochemical plants, and the like, and can significantly improve the<br>
durability and operation efficiency of apparatus.<br>
[0048]<br>
In particular, the metal material in accordance with the present invention is<br>
suitable as a metal material used for reaction tubes and heat exchangers used for heat<br>
exchange in a temperature range (400 to 800°C) lower than the conventional temperature<br>
range, so that metal dusting, which poses a problem in this temperature range, can be<br>
restrained effectively.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0049]<br>
The reason why the composition range of metal material is restricted according to<br>
the invention is as described below. In the explanation below, the "%" representation of<br>
the content of each element means "mass%".<br>
[0050]<br>
C: 0.08 to 0.4%<br>
C (carbon) is one of important elements in the present invention. Carbon not<br>
only enhances the strength at high temperatures but also achieves an effect of improving<br>
the weldability in combination with chromium to form carbides. In particular, the effect<br>
is remarkable in the metal material in accordance with the present invention that has high<br>
Si and Cu contents. To sufficiently achieve this effect, 0.08% or more of C must be<br>
contained. However, if C content exceeds 0.4%, the toughness of alloy lowers<br>
extremely, so that the upper limit of C content is set at 0.4%. The C content is<br>
preferably in the range of higher than 0.1% and 0.35% or less, further preferably in the<br>
range of higher than 0.15% and 0.25% or less.<br>
[0051]<br>
Si: 0.6 to 2.0%<br><br><br>
Si (silicon) is one of important elements in the present invention. Since silicon<br>
has a strong affinity with oxygen, it forms Si-based oxide scale in the lower layer of a<br>
protective oxide scale layer such as Cr2O3, and isolates carburizing gas. This action is<br>
brought about when the Si content is 0.6% or higher. However, if the Si content<br>
exceeds 2.0%, the weldability decreases remarkably, so that the upper limit of Si content<br>
is set at 2.0%. The Si content is preferably in the range of 0.7 to 2.0%, further<br>
preferably in the range of 0.8 to 1.5%.<br>
[0052]<br>
Mn: 0.05 to 2.5%<br>
Mn (manganese) has deoxidizing ability and also improves the workability and<br>
weldability, so that 0.05% or more of Mn is added. Also, since manganese is an<br>
austenite-generating element, some of Ni can be replaced with Mn. However, excessive<br>
addition of Mn harms the carburizing gas isolating properties of protective oxide scale<br>
layer, so that the upper limit of Mn content is set at 2.5%. The Mn content is preferably<br>
in the range of 0.1 to 2.0%, further preferably in the range of 0.7 to 1.6%.<br>
[0053]<br>
P: 0.04% or less<br>
P (phosphorus) decreases the hot workability and weldability, so that the upper<br>
limit of P content is set at 0.04%. In particular, when the Si and Cu contents are high,<br>
this effect is important. The upper limit of P content is preferably 0.03%, further<br>
preferably 0.025%. However, since phosphorus acts to restrain the dissociative<br>
adsorption reaction on the metal surface of carburizing gas, it may be contained when the<br>
decrease in weldability can be permitted.<br>
[0054]<br>
S: 0.015% or less<br>
S (sulfur) decreases the hot workability and weldability like phosphorus, so that<br>
the upper limit of S content is set at 0.015%. In particular, when the Si and Cu contents<br><br><br>
are high, this effect is important. The upper limit of S content is preferably 0.01%,<br>
further preferably 0.003%. However, like phosphorus, since sulfur acts to restrain the<br>
dissociative adsorption reaction on the metal surface of carburizing gas, it may be<br>
contained when the decrease in weldability can be permitted.<br>
[0055]<br>
Cr: 18 to 30% or 22 to 30%<br>
Cr (chromium) forms oxide scale such as Cr2O3 stably, and has an effect of<br>
isolating carburizing gas. Therefore, even in a severe carburizing gas environment,<br>
chromium provides sufficient carburization resistance, metal dusting resistance, and<br>
coking resistance. Also, chromium improves the weldability because it combines with<br>
carbon to form carbides. In particular, when the Si and Cu contents are high, this effect<br>
is important. To sufficiently achieve this effect, 18% or more of Cr must be contained.<br>
However, since excessive addition decreases not only the workability but also the<br>
structural stability, the upper limit of Cr is set at 30%. The lower limit of Cr content is<br>
preferably 19%, further preferably 22%, and still further preferably 23%. Also, the<br>
upper limit of Cr content is preferably 28%, further preferably 27%.<br>
[0056]<br>
Ni: 20% or higher and less than 30%<br>
Ni (nickel) is an element necessary for obtaining a stable austenitic micro-<br>
structure according to the Cr content, and therefore 20% or more of Ni must be contained.<br>
Also, when carbon intrudes into the metal material, nickel has a function of reducing the<br>
intrusion rate. Further, nickel acts to secure the high-temperature strength of the metal<br>
micro-structure. However, the nickel content higher than necessary may lead to cost<br>
increase and manufacturing difficulties, and may also accelerate coking and metal<br>
dusting especially in a gas environment that contains hydrocarbon. Therefore, the upper<br>
limit of Ni content is restricted to less than 30%. Preferably, the content of Ni is<br><br><br>
22.5% or higher and less than 30%. Further preferably, the content of Ni is higher<br>
than 25% and 29.5% or less.<br>
[0057]<br>
Cu: 0.5 to 10.0%<br>
Cu (copper) is one of important elements in the present invention. Copper<br>
restrains reaction between carburizing gas and the metal surface, and greatly improves<br>
the metal dusting resistance and the like. Also, since copper is an austenite-generating<br>
element, some of Ni can be replaced with Cu. To achieve the metal dusting resistance<br>
improving effect, 0.5% or more of Cu must be contained. However, if Cu exceeding<br>
10.0% is contained, the weldability decreases, so that the upper limit of Cu content is set<br>
at 10.0%. The Cu content is preferably 1.0 to 6.0%, further preferably 2.1 to 4.0%.<br>
[0058]<br>
Al: 0.01 to 1%<br>
Al (aluminum) is an element effective in improving the high-temperature strength.<br>
Also, aluminum has an effect as a deoxidizer because it has a high affinity with oxygen.<br>
In addition, aluminum serves as one of the constituent elements of oxide scale, and<br>
enhances the gas isolating properties. This effect can be anticipated especially in an<br>
environment in which the carburizing properties are strong. To achieve this effect, it is<br>
effective to contain 0.01% or more of Al. On the other hand, if the Al content exceeds<br>
1%, the weldability is impaired. Therefore, the Al content is set in the range of 0.01 to<br>
1%. The Al content is preferably in the range of 0.12 to 0.8%, further preferably in the<br>
range of 0.2 to 0.6%.<br>
[0059]<br>
Ti: 0.01 to 1%<br>
Ti (titanium) is an element effective in improving the high-temperature strength.<br>
Also, since titanium has an affinity with oxygen, it serves as one of the constituent<br>
elements of oxide scale, and enhances the gas isolating properties. This effect can be<br><br>
anticipated especially in an environment in which the carburizing properties are strong.<br>
Therefore, titanium is contained positively. To achieve this effect, it is effective to<br>
contain 0.01% or more of Ti. However, if titanium is contained excessively, the<br>
workability and weldability decrease, so that the upper limit of Ti content is set at 1%.<br>
The Ti content is preferably in the range of 0.12 to 0.8%, further preferably in the range<br>
of 0.2 to 0.6%.<br>
[0060]<br>
N: 0.15% or less<br>
N (nitrogen) need not necessarily be contained. If nitrogen is contained, it acts<br>
to enhance the high-temperature strength of metal material. However, if the N content<br>
exceeds 0.15%, the workability is impaired. Therefore, the upper limit of N content is<br>
set at 0.15%). The preferred upper limit thereof is 0.05%. To achieve the effect of<br>
enhancing the high-temperature strength of metal material, preferably 0.0005% or more,<br>
further preferably 0.001% or more, of N is contained.<br>
[0061]<br>
O: 0.02% or less<br>
O (oxygen) is an impurity element mingled from a raw material or the like when<br>
the metal material is melted . If the O content exceeds 0.02%, large amounts of oxide<br>
inclusions exist in the metal material, so that the workability decreases, and also a flaw<br>
may occur on the surface of metal material. Therefore, the upper limit of O content is<br>
set at 0.02%.<br>
[0062]<br>
Next, in addition to the method of invention (1) or invention (2), invention (3)<br>
relating to a metal material whose strength, ductility, and toughness are improved is<br>
explained.<br>
[0063]<br><br>
Invention (3) relates to a carburization resistant metal material characterized by<br>
further containing, by mass%, at least one kind of a component selected from at least one<br>
group of the first group to the fifth group described below in a metal material specified in<br>
invention (1) or (2):<br>

[0064]<br>
Next, these optionally added elements are explained.<br>
[0065]<br>
First group (Co: 10% or less, by mass%)<br>
Co (cobalt) acts to stabilize the austenite phase, so that it can replace some of Ni<br>
component. Therefore, cobalt may be contained as necessary. However, if the Co<br>
content exceeds 10%, cobalt deteriorates the hot workability. Therefore, when cobalt is<br>
contained, the content is 10% or less. From the viewpoint of hot workability, the Co<br>
content is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5%, further preferably in the range of 0.01 to<br>
3%.<br>
[0066]<br>
Second group (Mo: 2.5% or less and W: 5% or less, by mass%)<br>
Mo (molybdenum) and W (tungsten) are solid-solution strengthening elements, so<br>
that either one or both of them may be contained as necessary. However, when<br>
molybdenum is contained, molybdenum deteriorates the workability and impairs the<br>
structural stability if the content exceeds 2.5%. Therefore, when molybdenum is<br><br>
contained, the content is 2.5% or less. The Mo content is preferably 0.01 to 2.3%.<br>
Also, when tungsten is contained, tungsten deteriorates the workability and impairs the<br>
structural stability if the content exceeds 5%. Therefore, when tungsten is contained,<br>
the content is 5% or less. The W content is preferably 0.01 to 2.3%.<br>
[0067]<br>
Third group (B: 0.1% or less, V: 0.5% or less, Zr: 0.1% or less, Nb: 2% or less,<br>
and Hf: 0.5% or less, by mass%)<br>
B (boron), V (vanadium), Zr (zirconium), Nb (niobium) and Hf (hafnium) are<br>
elements effective in improving the high-temperature strength characteristics, so that one<br>
kind or two or more kinds of these elements may be contained. However, when boron<br>
is contained, boron deteriorates the weldability if the content exceeds 0.1%. Therefore,<br>
when boron is contained, the content is 0.1% or less. The B content is preferably 0.001<br>
to 0.05%. When vanadium is contained, vanadium deteriorates the weldability if the<br>
content exceeds 0.5%. Therefore, when vanadium is contained, the content is 0.5% or<br>
less. The V content is preferably 0.001 to 0.1%. When zirconium is contained,<br>
zirconium deteriorates the weldability if the content exceeds 0.1 %. Therefore, when<br>
zirconium is contained, the content is 0.1%) or less. The Zr content is preferably 0.001<br>
to 0.05%. When niobium is contained, niobium deteriorates the weldability if the<br>
content exceeds 2%. Therefore, when niobium is contained, the content is 2% or less.<br>
The Nb content is preferably 0.001 to 0.1%. Also, when hafnium is contained, hafnium<br>
deteriorates the weldability if the content exceeds 0.5%. Therefore, when hafnium is<br>
contained, the content is 0.5% or less. The Hf content is preferably 0.001 to 0.1%.<br>
[0068]<br>
Fourth group (Mg: 0.1% or less and Ca: 0.1% or less, by mass%)<br>
Mg (magnesium) and Ca (calcium) have an effect of improving the hot<br>
workability, so that one kind or two or more kinds of these elements may be contained as<br>
necessary. However, when magnesium is contained, magnesium deteriorates the<br><br><br>
weldability if the content exceeds 0.1 %. Therefore, when magnesium is contained, the<br>
content is 0.1% or less. The Mg content is preferably 0.0005 to 0.1%. Also, when<br>
calcium is contained, calcium deteriorates the weldability if the content exceeds 0.1%.<br>
Therefore, when calcium is contained, the content is 0.1% or less. The Ca content is<br>
preferably 0.0005 to 0.1%.<br>
[0069]<br>
Fifth group (Y: 0.15% or less, La: 0.15% or less, Ce: 0.15% or less, and Nd:<br>
0.15% or less, by mass%)<br>
Y (yttrium), La (lanthanum), Ce (cerium) and Nd (neodymium) have an effect of<br>
improving the oxidation resistance, so that one kind or two or more kinds of these<br>
elements may be contained as necessary. However, when these elements are contained,<br>
these elements deteriorate the workability if the content of any one element thereof<br>
exceeds 0.15%. Therefore, when these elements are contained, the content of any one<br>
element thereof is 0.15% or less. The content is preferably 0.0005 to 0.15%.<br>
[0070]<br>
The metal material in accordance with the present invention having a function of<br>
restraining the reaction between carburizing gas and the metal surface has only to satisfy<br>
the requirements specified in the above-described items (f) and (g) because the metal<br>
material has problems of metal dusting, carburization, and coking.<br>
[0071]<br>
The metal material in accordance with the present invention may be formed into a<br>
required shape such as a thick plate, sheet, seamless tube, welded tube, forged product,<br>
and wire rod by means of melting, casting, hot working, cold rolling, welding, and the<br>
like. Also, the metal material may be formed into a required shape by means of powder<br>
metallurgy, centrifugal casting, and the like. The surface of the metal material having<br>
been subjected to final heat treatment may be subjected to surface treatment such as<br>
pickling, shotblasting, shotpeening, mechanical cutting, grinding, and electropolishing.<br><br><br>
Also, on the surface of the metal material in accordance with the present invention, one<br>
or two or more irregular shapes such as protruding shapes may be formed. Also, the<br>
metal material in accordance with the present invention may be combined with various<br>
kinds of carbon steels, stainless steels, Ni-based alloys, Co-based alloys, Cu-based alloys,<br>
and the like to be formed into a required shape. In this case, the joining method of the<br>
metal material in accordance with the present invention to the various kinds of steels and<br>
alloys is not subject to any restriction. For example, mechanical joining such as<br>
pressure welding and "staking" and thermal joining such as welding and diffusion<br>
treatment can be performed.<br>
[0072]<br>
Next, the present invention is explained in more detail with reference to examples.<br>
The present invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
[Example 1]<br>
[0073]<br>
A metal material having a chemical composition given in Table 1 was melted by<br>
using a high-frequency heating vacuum furnace, and a metal plate having a plate<br>
thickness of 6 mm was manufactured by hot forging and hot rolling. The metal plate<br>
was subjected to solid-solution heat treatment at 1160 to 1230°C for 5 minutes, a part of<br>
which was cut to produce a test piece .<br>
[0074]<br>
From the metal material described in Table 1, a test piece measuring 15 mm wide<br>
and 20 mm long was cut. This test piece was isothermally maintained at 650°C in a<br>
45%CO-42.5%H2-6.5%CO2-6%H2O (percent by volume) gas atmosphere. The test<br>
piece was taken out after 200 hours had elapsed, and the presence of a pit formed on the<br>
surface of test piece was examined by visual observation and by optical microscope<br>
observation. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0077]<br>
Table 2 indicates that, among Nos. 24 to 33 metal materials in which the chemical<br>
composition deviates from the condition specified in the present invention, Nos. 24, 26,<br>
28, 32 and 33 metal materials had a pit formed after 200 hours had elapsed. Therefore,<br>
the metal dusting resistance is poor in a synthetic gas environment containing CO. On<br><br>
the other hand, in all of the metal materials specified in the present invention, no pit is<br>
formed, and therefore, these metal materials have excellent metal dusting resistance.<br>
[Example 2]<br>
[0078]<br>
A metal material having a chemical composition given in Table 1 was melted by<br>
using a high-frequency heating vacuum furnace, and a metal plate having a plate<br>
thickness of 6 mm was manufactured by hot forging and hot rolling. The metal plate<br>
was subjected to solid-solution heat treatment at 1160 to 1230°C for 5 minutes, a part of<br>
which was cut to produce a test piece. From the metal material described in Table 1, a<br>
test piece measuring 15 mm wide and 20 mm long was cut. This test piece was<br>
isothermally maintained at 650°C in a 30%C3H8-70%H2 (percent by volume) gas<br>
atmosphere. The test piece was taken out after 10 hours had elapsed, and the presence<br>
of a pit formed on the surface of test piece was examined by visual observation and by<br>
optical microscope observation. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br>
[0079]<br>
Table 2 indicates that, among Nos. 24 to 33 metal materials in which the chemical<br>
composition deviates from the condition specified in the present invention, Nos. 24, 26 to<br>
28, and 31 to 33 metal materials had a pit formed in the 10-hour test. Therefore, the<br>
metal dusting resistance is poor in a hydrocarbon gas environment. On the other hand,<br>
in all of the metal materials specified in the present invention, no pit is formed, and<br>
therefore, these metal materials have excellent metal dusting resistance.<br>
[Example 3]<br>
[0080]<br>
A metal material having a chemical composition given in Table 1 was melted by<br>
using a high-frequency heating vacuum furnace, and two metal plates each having a plate<br>
thickness of 12 mm, a width of 50 mm, and a length of 100 mm was manufactured from<br>
each metal material by hot forging and hot rolling. The metal plates were subjected to<br><br><br>
solid-solution heat treatment at 1200°C for 5 minutes, a part of which was cut to produce<br>
a test piece.<br>
[0081]<br>
Then, on one side in the lengthwise direction of the test piece, a V-type edge<br>
having an angle of 30 degrees and a root thickness of 1.0 mm was prepared. Thereafter,<br>
the periphery of the test pieces was restraint-welded onto a commercially available metal<br>
plate of SM400C specified in JIS G3106(2004) measuring 25 mm thick, 150 mm wide,<br>
and 150 mm long by using a covered electrode of DNiCrMo-3 specified in JIS<br>
Z3224(1999). Subsequently, multi-layer welds were made by TIG welding under a<br>
condition of heat input of 6 kJ/cm by using a TIG welding wire of YNiCrMo-3 specified<br>
in JIS Z3334(l999). After the aforementioned welding, ten test pieces for observing the<br>
sectional microstructure of joint were cut from each test piece, and the cross sections<br>
thereof were mirror polished and corroded. Thereby, the presence of cracks in the HAZ<br>
was observed by an optical microscope at x500 magnification. The results are<br>
summarized in Table 2.<br>
[0082]<br>
Table 2 indicates that in No. 24 metal material in which the C content deviates<br>
from the condition specified in the present invention and No. 25 metal material that does<br>
not satisfy Expression (1), HAZ cracks are recognized. Also, it is indicated that for Nos.<br>
28 to 31 metal materials in which the Cu, Si and S contents deviate from the condition<br>
specified in the present invention though the C content meets the specified condition, the<br>
HAZ crack restraining effect is small. On the other hand, in all of the metal materials<br>
specified in the present invention, HAZ cracks are not generated. Therefore, the<br>
weldability thereof is excellent.<br>
