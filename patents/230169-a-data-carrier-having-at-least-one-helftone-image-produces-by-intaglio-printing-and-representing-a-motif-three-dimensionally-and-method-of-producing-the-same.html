				<td>A DATA CARRIER HAVING AT LEAST ONE HALFTONE IMAGE PRODUCED<br>
BY INTAGLIO PRINTING AND REPRESENTING A MOTIF THREE-<br>
DIMENSIONALLY AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
This invention relates to a data carrier printed with a tactile halftone image, a<br>
method for producing it and a printing plate suitable therefor.<br>
Data carriers according to the invention are in particular security documents or<br>
documents of value such as bank notes, ID cards, passports, check forms, shares, certificates,<br>
postage stamps, plane tickets and the like as well as labels, seals, packages or<br>
other elements for protecting products. The simple designation "data carrier" and "se-<br>
curity document or document of value" hereinafter will therefore always include docu-<br>
ments of the stated type.<br>
Such papers, whose commercial or utility value far exceeds their material value,<br>
must be recognizable as authentic and distinguishable from imitations and forgeries by<br>
suitable measures. They are therefore provided with special security elements that are<br>
ideally not imitable or falsifiable, or only with great effort.<br>
In the past particularly those security elements have proved useful that are identified<br>
and recognized as authentic by the viewer without aids but can simultaneously<br>
only be produced with the greatest effort. These are e.g. watermarks, which can only<br>
be incorporated in the data carrier during papermaking, or motifs produced by intaglio<br>
printing, which are characterized by their tactility which cannot be imitated by copying<br>
machines.<br>
Line or intaglio printing, in particular steel intaglio printing, is an important<br>
technique for printing data carriers, in particular papers of value such as bank notes<br>
and the like.<br>
Intaglio printing is characterized in that linear depressions are formed in the printing<br>
plates to produce a printed image. The ink-transferring areas of the plate are thus<br>
present as depressions in the plate surface. Said depressions are produced by a suitable<br>
engraving tool or by etching. The mechanically fabricated plate for intaglio printing<br>
produces a wider line with increasing engraving depth due to the usually.<br><br>
tapered engraving tools. Furthermore, the ink receptivity of the engraved line and thus<br>
the opacity of the printed line increases with increasing engraving depth.<br>
In the etching of intaglio printing plates, the nonprinting areas of the plate are<br>
covered with a chemically inert lacquer. Subsequent etching produces the engraving in<br>
the exposed plate surface, the depth of the engraved lines depending in particular on<br>
the etching time. Before the actual printing operation, ink of pasty consistency is applied<br>
to the engraved plate and the surplus ink removed from the surface of the plate<br>
by a wiping blade or cylinder so that ink is left behind only in the depressions. A substrate,<br>
normally paper, is then pressed against the plate and thereby also into the inkfilled<br>
depressions of the plate, and removed again, whereby ink is drawn out of the<br>
depressions of the plate, sticks to the substrate surface and forms a printed image there.<br>
If transparent inks are used, the thickness of the inking determines the color tone.<br>
Thus, a light color tone is obtained when printing a white data carrier with small ink<br>
layer thicknesses, and darker color tones when printing with thick ink layers. Ink layer<br>
thickness is in turn dependent on engraving depth to a certain extent.<br>
Line intaglio printing permits relatively thick inking on a data carrier in comparison<br>
to other common printing methods, such as offset. The comparatively thick ink<br>
layer produced by line intaglio, together with the partial deformation of the paper surface<br>
resulting from the paper being pressed into the engraving of the plate, is easily<br>
feelable manually even to the layman and thus readily recognizable as an authenticity<br>
feature on the basis of its tactility. The tactility cannot be imitated with a copier so that<br>
line intaglio printing offers high-grade protection against forgeries.<br>
Such printed images can be printed all over only with special additional effort,<br>
since the unengraved surfaces of the printing plate usually do not transfer any ink to<br>
the paper being printed, so that the printed image is normally always limited to motifs<br>
composed of narrow lines. A combination of all-over printing with tactility is impossible<br>
with conventional intaglio printing.<br>
A further intaglio printing technique to be distinguished from line intaglio is rotogravure.<br>
Rotogravure, in particular halftone rotogravure, is characterized in that different<br>
gray or color values of the printed image are produced by cells disposed<br><br>
regularly in the printing plate, spaced with wide bars and having different density, size<br>
and/or depth. In rotogravure the printing plates are produced for example mechanically<br>
by means of graving tools or by removal by electron beam or laser beam. Rotogravure<br>
typically uses fluid ink and a doctor blade. The principle of the printing operation is<br>
based on the cells being filled with fluid ink and ink being held in the cells of different<br>
depth. The screen bars limiting the cells serve as a support for the doctor blade but are<br>
nonprinting themselves. In printing, the limits between adjacent print areas fuse due to<br>
the fluidity of the ink, however, so that said areas are no longer precisely separable.<br>
This results quasi in an all-overprinted image. However, the lack of viscosity of the<br>
ink and the low contact pressure prevent relief formation so that the printed image has<br>
no tactility.<br>
Conventional rotogravure and line intaglio therefore have the disadvantage that<br>
no tactility in the printed image along with all-over printing can be realized in one<br>
printing cycle.<br>
The problem of the present invention is to provide a data carrier with elevated<br>
forgery-proofness that has a picture motif that is both tactile and difficult to imitate by<br>
printing technology and optically striking since produced by intaglio printing.<br>
A further problem is to-provide a printing plate for producing the inventively<br>
printed data carrier and a corresponding production method.<br>
This problem is solved by the independent claims. Developments are the subject<br>
matter of the subclaims.<br>
The invention is based on the printed image provided on the data carrier and<br>
produced by intaglio printing being a halftone image. Said halftone image includes<br>
directly adjacent printed partial surfaces in at least a partial area of the image, the<br>
partial surfaces having certain tonal values with at least three printed partial surfaces<br>
having different tonal values, wherein at least a partial area of the image is perceptively<br>
tactilely.<br>
"Halftone image" designates according to the invention an image having<br>
intermediate tones between the lightest and darkest places of the image. If a black-and-<br><br>
white image is involved, "tonal value" refers as usual to a value on a gray scale<br>
from white to black. However, the present invention does not relate only to black-and-white<br>
halftone images containing achromatic colors, namely white, black and<br>
gray, but of course also to one- or multicolor halftone images including so-called<br>
chromatic colors. In the case of chromatic halftone images, "tonal value"refers to<br>
the brightness of the color in question. The inventive image includes at least three<br>
printed tonal values. If the basic color of the substrate to be printed, e.g. the white<br>
of the paper, is integrated into the design of the image, the image has four tonal<br>
values, e.g. white, black and two gray values. In especially preferred embodiments,<br>
the printed image has a much greater tonal-value range, so that not only light and<br>
shadow effects but also three-dimensional effects can be achieved. The finer the<br>
tonal-value graduations, i.e. the greater the tonal-value scale, the better motifs can<br>
be represented three-dimensionally, and the printed image ideally approaches a<br>
photographic representation whereby the tonal-value graduations pass into one<br>
another quasi continuously. Tests have shown, however, that four halftone steps<br>
already convey a very realistic halftone impression. At six halftone steps, the<br>
layman already sees relatively little difference over the photographic halftone<br>
image.<br>
The halftone image can represent any desired motif. However, pictorial representations<br>
are preferred. Representation of portraits is especially preferred, since human<br>
perception is trained to see extremely fine differences in portraits, so that the recognition<br>
value and thus protection, value of this security element is especially great. A plurality<br>
of halftone images can also be combined in any desired number and form.<br>
Since conventional intaglio inks are transparent and translucent to a certain degree,<br>
color or gray tones of different brightness and color saturation result with suitable<br>
layer thicknesses and expedient choice of background color. The different brightnesses<br>
according to the invention, hereinafter designated "tonal values," can thus be<br>
produced solely via the ink layer thickness, i.e. the printed partial surfaces of different<br>
tonal values are printed with an ink layer of different thickness. Thus, light color tones<br>
are obtained when printing a white data carrier with small ink layer thicknesses, and<br>
darker color tones when printing with thick ink layers. It is also possible that not only<br>
brightness but also color saturation changes in accordance with layer thickness de-<br><br>
layer thickness depending on the ink and substrate used. Normally, ink layer thickness<br>
mainly influences brightness value and saturation, however. The influence of layer<br>
thickness on saturation and brightness is to be determined accordingly in each<br>
individual case, i.e. for each ink and substrate. If there is sufficient difference in the<br>
ink layer thicknesses of adjacent surfaces, readily visible contrasts result for the human<br>
eye without any aids. This assumes normal lighting conditions and a normal viewing<br>
distance.<br>
To produce an inventive printed image, an original, preferably a portrait, is first<br>
subdivided into tonal value-based partial surfaces. The individual tonal values or<br>
groups of tonal values of this conversion are then assigned different engraving depths<br>
for the printing plate to be produced, coordinated with the ink being used. For example,<br>
maximum engraving depth for black and minimum engraving depth or unengraved<br>
for white. All tonal values of the original are to be converted into corresponding engraving<br>
depths on the printing plate accordingly. The engraving depth of the plate necessary<br>
for producing a special tonal value varies from ink to ink.<br>
Which assignment is necessary can be easily determined by proofing a stepped<br>
gray wedge with the ink under discussion. The gray wedge has for this purpose a plurality<br>
of surface elements that are lined up and differ in defined engraving-depth steps.<br>
For example, if the engraving depth is varied in 5-micron steps, the gray wedge begins<br>
with a field with an engraving depth of 5 microns, the next field has an engraving<br>
depth of 10 microns, the next 15 microns, etc., up to an engraving depth of e.g. 100<br>
microns. The field size is for example 5x5 millimeters. The individual fields are separated<br>
only by narrow separation edges.<br>
If the gray wedge is now printed with a special ink, one will ascertain that the<br>
first field has a special light tonal value that contrasts with the next field, the next<br>
fields each having darker tonal values up to a field where the darkest tonal value is<br>
present. From this field on there is no more tonal-value variation. Depending on how<br>
many tonal values are to be used in the later halftone image to be printed, they are assigned<br>
to the particular fields of the gray wedge, thereby also obtaining the engraving<br>
depths required for producing the printing plate.<br><br>
This gray-wedge test is to be done separately for each ink. If an ink has a deficient<br>
"transparency bandwidth," i.e. too few tonal values contrasting with increasing<br>
engraving depth, it can be adapted by measures known to the expert.<br>
If a halftone image wherein the engraving depths of the tonal-value areas are coordinated<br>
with the ink transparency is printed, a halftone resolution is obtained without<br>
the otherwise usual screen technique. The tonal values are based solely on the transparency<br>
of the inks. Additionally, the printed halftone image has a surface relief in<br>
which the darker parts are formed higher than the light ones.<br>
"Partial surfaces" designate according to the invention surfaces constituting the<br>
halftone image. The partial surfaces are printed and possibly unprinted surfaces, at<br>
least a portion of the printed partial surfaces being directly adjacent. "Directly adjacent"<br>
means that the adjacent partial surfaces are not separated by unprinted areas in<br>
the printed image. Preferably, the proportion of printed partial surfaces is greater than<br>
the proportion of unprinted partial surfaces in the inventively printed halftone image. It<br>
is also preferable for the printed partial surfaces to be predominantly adjacent so that<br>
the inventively printed halftone image arouses the impression of a substantially all-over<br>
print. The adjacent partial surfaces can have different tonal values, i.e. different<br>
ink layer thickness, but also the same tonal values, i.e. the same ink layer thickness. In<br>
particular, unprinted surfaces are used mainly for design purposes, for example to represent<br>
light reflexes or shiny places.<br>
To increase the stability of the data carrier it can be expedient to cover the inventive<br>
halftone image with a coating, such as a lacquer layer. Said lacquer can contain feature<br>
substances, such as luminescent substances, etc., or other effect pigments, such as<br>
liquid-crystal pigments. Moreover, the lacquer can be executed in matt or glossy form.<br>
In addition, the protective lacquer layer serves to increase the glossy effect and to protect<br>
the print.<br>
Suitable substrates or data carrier materials are all substrate materials that can be<br>
used for intaglio printing, such as paper, plastic foils, coated paper or paper laminated<br>
with plastic foils and multilayer composite materials. In particular, the inventive<br>
method is suitable for printing data carriers that must meet high standards with respect<br><br>
to forgery-proofness, such as security documents and documents of value, for example<br>
bank notes, shares, bonds, certificates, vouchers and the like.<br>
Particularly complex printed images can be rendered by adjoining printed areas<br>
and surfaces with different ink layer thickness directly and in any order. This enormously<br>
increases the freedom of design in preparing and rendering printed images<br>
produced by intaglio printing.<br>
The inventive method for producing corresponding printed data carriers has in<br>
addition considerable economic advantages, since the surfaces provided for printing<br>
with different ink layer thicknesses are produced in a single printing pass with one and<br>
the same ink.<br>
The forgery-proofness of the inventive security element or security print can finally<br>
be increased further if there is a frequent change between the different tonal values<br>
of the partial surfaces. The partial surfaces differ here with respect to their superficial<br>
extent and/or their light/dark contrast and/or their tactility. The exact register between<br>
the different printed partial surfaces and the resulting special optical impression<br>
of the security print can only be produced by intaglio printing, i.e. using a printing<br>
plate in which the security print is engraved completely and with the necessary register.<br>
The predominant portion of the ink-carrying partial surfaces is advantageously<br>
directly adjacent so that a substantially all-over printed image is present in the later<br>
printed image.<br>
The inventive intaglio printing plates are preferably produced by engraving with<br>
a fast-rotating, tapered graver, for example by a method described in WO 97/48555.<br>
The engravings can fundamentally also be produced by means of laser engraving or<br>
etching or any other suitable removal method.<br>
In order to prevent directly adjacent ink layers from flowing into each other<br>
along their boundary line before the ink dries after being transferred to a data carrier,<br>
so-called "separation edges" are integrated into the printing plate between surfaces<br>
with different engraving depth according to WO 00/20216 and WO 00/20217. Said<br>
separation edges have a tapered, wedge-shaped cross-sectional profile. The tip of the<br><br>
wedge is preferably located at the height of the printing plate surface or slightly there-under.<br>
The tip of the separation edge profile forms a largely one-dimensional line similar<br>
to a knife blade along the separation edge. It separates the printing plate areas of<br>
different engraving depth, but does not produce an ink-free interruption of the printed<br>
ink surfaces. With the support of the separation edge integrated into the printing plate,<br>
the intaglio ink, which is of pasty consistency, is left "standing" in dimensionally stable<br>
fashion after its transfer to a substrate even when surfaces printed with different<br>
layer thickness directly abut. This permits extremely fine, superimposed structures<br>
with different ink layer thickness and high edge sharpness to be printed by intaglio<br>
printing.<br>
If the engravings of the printing plate are not inked, or at least not completely<br>
inked, that is, filled with ink, before the printing operation, the uninked area of the<br>
plate acts only as an embossing plate, which can be used to produce so-called blind<br>
embossings on a substrate during the intaglio printing operation. The embossed elements<br>
have similar proportions and tactile properties to the above-described printed<br>
surfaces, just without the visual impression produced by the ink.<br>
The thus produced printing plate is finally used to print the data carrier.<br>
The high contact pressure during intaglio printing additionally subjects the substrate<br>
material to an embossing which also stands out on the back of the substrate.<br>
The procedure for converting a halftone original into an inventive printed image<br>
is preferably as follows:<br>
1. Defining the number of tonal values for rendering the halftone original (e.g. a<br>
photo) by printing technology.<br>
It should be noted here once again that the more tonal values are used, the closer<br>
one comes to the appearance of the original. However, tests have shown that five<br>
or six tonal values already permit a sufficiently precise halftone rendition.<br><br>
2.	 Preparing the tonal-value separations from the halftone original.<br>
3.	 Defining the ink for rendering the halftone motif by printing technology.<br>
4. Determining the transparency range of the ink (unless already done) and assigning<br>
tonal values to ink layer thicknesses or engraving depths.<br>
5.	 Defining the partial surfaces of the printing plate to be produced by defining the<br>
surface areas with defined engraving depth, defining the separation edges, ink<br>
trap structures, etc.<br>
6.	 Producing the printing plate by removing the particular layer areas, preferably by<br>
engraving technology according to WO 97/48555.<br>
7.	 Proofing the specimen prints for evaluating the printing conversion and making<br>
any necessary corrections.<br>
The inventively printed data carriers have elevated forgery-proofhess since they<br>
are not reproducible with common printing processes due to the characteristic intaglio<br>
printed image. This exactly registered positioning of the partial surfaces is not possible<br>
by superimposing two printed images produced by successive, mutually independent<br>
printing or embossing operations.<br>
The tactilely perceptible picture elements additionally offer effective protection<br>
against imitation by color photocopying or scanning of the data carriers.<br>
Intaglio printing, in particular steel intaglio printing, thus provides a characteristic<br>
printed or embossed image that is readily recognizable even to laymen and cannot<br>
be imitated with other common printing processes. Steel intaglio printing is therefore<br>
preferably used for printing data carriers, in particular security documents and documents<br>
of value, for example bank notes, shares, bonds, certificates, vouchers and the<br>
like, which must meet high standards with respect to forgery-proofness.<br>
The following examples and accompanying drawings will serve to explain the advantages<br>
of the invention. The described single features and examples described hereinafter<br>
are inventive when taken alone, but also inventive in combination. The exam-<br><br>
examples involve preferred embodiments, but the invention is by no means to be<br>
restricted thereto. The proportions shown in the figures do not necessarily correspond<br>
to actually existing relations and serve primarily to improve the clarity.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a sketch of a bank note as data carrier 1. The printed image of a<br>
bank note is typically a superimposition of a plurality of printed images each produced<br>
separately by a different printing process. The depicted bank note shows for example<br>
printed image 2 representing the numeral 5. Printed image 2 is realized by conventional<br>
intaglio printing, which means that different brightnesses are rendered by line<br>
screens with varying line distance or line width. Further, background pattern 3 of fine<br>
lines produced by offset, and serial number 4 applied by letterpress, are present. In<br>
addition, partial areas produced by screen printing might be provided, etc.<br>
Inventive print 5, which is to show a portrait, is provided in a partial area of the<br>
bank note in the example shown here and rendered only schematically. The precise<br>
description of the inventive print, the printed data carrier and the printing plate used<br>
will be explained with reference to the following examples and figures.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a halftone image that is to serve as the original for the inventive<br>
printed halftone image. In the present case this is a black-and-white photograph, which<br>
usually does not have any grid recognizable to the naked eye. The grid visible in Fig. 2<br>
is only selected secondarily to make the "photo" capable of being duplicated by print-<br><br>
printing technology. The original of Fig. 2 shows a detail of a portrait and is to be<br>
understood as a classic halftone image containing a plurality of intermediate tones between<br>
the lightest tonal value, white here, and the darkest tonal value, black here.<br>
According to the invention, halftone separations are prepared from the halftone<br>
original. Fig. 3 shows e.g. a halftone original from tonal-value separations with five<br>
tonal values, namely white, light gray, medium gray, dark gray and black, which have<br>
been derived from the halftone original as shown in Fig. 2. Said originals according to<br>
Figs. 2 and Fig. 3 can now be superimposed by a screen, whereby the individual partial<br>
surfaces (pixels) resulting from the screening are assigned certain tonal values.<br>
The original can be broken down into partial surfaces using any desired forms of<br>
screen. Both simple, regular, geometrical structures and randomly distributed, irregular<br>
and complicated structures can be used. The limits of the partial surfaces can likewise<br>
be defined at will.<br>
It is thus possible to use for instance parallel, almost parallel, spiral-shaped, starshaped,<br>
intersecting or intertwined line systems with a zigzag, wavy, arcuate, circular<br>
or straight course, guilloches, geometrical structures such as circles, ellipses, triangles<br>
and other polygons.<br>
The various described screen variants for breaking down a printed image into<br>
partial surfaces can of course also be combined. The original can be divided into partial<br>
surfaces at will, the only restriction being that printed partial surfaces are adjacent<br>
at least in a partial area of the printed halftone image.<br>
The original image converted into partial surfaces with certain tonal values is in<br>
turn assigned the engraving depths for converting the original into an engraving on an<br>
intaglio printing plate. The engraving depths are ink-dependent and determined substantially<br>
by the transparency bandwidth of the ink to be used.<br>
The following examples will explain various embodiments of the invention by<br>
way of example.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
If a most realistic copy of the master is to be obtained, it is expedient to perform<br>
the screening as an areal resolution of the original image. This variant is shown in<br>
Fig. 4. Partial surfaces 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are thus obtained from the original itself. This<br>
means that the partial surfaces are based on a pictorial section in the original. This is<br>
effected automatically in the preparation of halftone separations whereby areas corresponding<br>
to a certain tonal-value range are assigned partial surfaces which are then<br>
rendered with a uniform tonal value. This leads to areally resolved originals in which<br>
the particular tonal values are subdivided into tonal-value ranges and each tonal-value<br>
range rendered by a defined tonal value. In the case of e.g. five tonal-value ranges, the<br>
total range of tonal values 0 to 100% is subdivided e.g. into five equal parts, i.e. from 1<br>
to 20%, from 21 to 40%, from 41 to 60%, etc. Then each of the tonal-value ranges is<br>
rendered collectively by e.g. the highest tonal value of the individual range, i.e. the<br>
tonal values from 1 to 20% are rendered by a uniform tonal value of e.g. 20%, those<br>
from 21 to 40% by a tonal value of 40%, etc. The tonal values of the stated example<br>
are thus 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. However, the tonal-value ranges can<br>
also be selected irregularly, e.g. 0%, 30%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 100%. In this case, lighter<br>
image areas are e.g. given less weight than dark image parts. It is also to be heeded<br>
that a tonal-value separation usually does not represent a contiguous surface but con-<br>
sists of individual island-like areas, which may be distributed over the entire image<br>
surface, so that each of said island-like areas is to assigned an inventive partial surface<br>
with the corresponding tonal value. The partial surfaces belonging to a tonal-value<br>
separation are characterized by a uniform engraving depth or ink layer thickness in the<br>
total printed image. The screen superimposed on the original is in this case adapted<br>
precisely to the boundary lines of the surfaces that represent certain tonal values.<br>
Looking at the image shown in Fig. 4, this would result e.g. in three black partial surfaces<br>
6 having the dimensions of the black areas in the original. In addition, the corresponding<br>
partial surfaces for the dark gray (7), medium gray (8), light gray (9) and<br>
white areas (10) would be present. The dimensions of the partial surfaces and thus the<br>
later engraving thus result directly from the image surfaces in the original. When the<br>
dimension of the partial surface as well as the assigned tonal value and the related en-<br><br>
engraving depth are established, all necessary data for converting the original into an<br>
engraving are known.<br>
Black separating lines 11 shown in Fig. 4 are normally invisible in the printed<br>
image. They serve only to illustrate the limits of the partial surfaces better. In the<br>
printed image the partial surfaces are directly adjacent in the area of said black lines<br>
without being separated by lines. If a printing plate with the above-described separation<br>
edge extending to just under the plate surface is used, a very fine, light, but inked,<br>
i.e. printed, line might be seen in the printed image in the area of the black lines shown<br>
in Fig. 4. Partial surface 10 appearing white in the printed image is an unprinted place<br>
in the otherwise all-over printed image, assuming the substrate to be printed is white.<br>
Example 2<br>
Besides the method described in Example 1 of determining the partial surfaces in<br>
dependence on the picture motif, it is also possible to bring the original in congruence<br>
with a separately produced screen to produce the partial surfaces of the printed image.<br>
According to this embodiment, a screen is placed over the original image, i.e. the<br>
original is split into partial surfaces quite independently of the motif. Said partial surfaces,<br>
which correspond to the partial surfaces in the later inventive printed image, are<br>
assigned tonal values. The finer the screen, in other words, the smaller the partial surfaces<br>
constituting the inventive halftone image, the more image details can be rendered.<br>
Said tonal values are then converted into engraving depths for the printing plate,<br>
as described above.<br>
In the simplest case, a pixel screen is used. In Fig. 5, the original from Fig. 2 has<br>
been superimposed with such a screen. This causes the original to be resolved into uniform<br>
square partial surfaces 12. One partial surface 12 is thus represented by a box/<br>
pixel. Fig. 5a shows a detail of Fig. 5, the section designated "x." As explained in Example<br>
1, the black lines in Fig. 5 and Fig. 5a serve only to delimit the partial surfaces.<br>
They are not visible as black lines in the printed image.<br><br>
Each box or pixel is assigned a certain tonal value in the next step. If a plurality<br>
of tonal values are present in a box, an average is formed for example by integration<br>
and then determines the tonal value of the pixel. Since the classic halftone image according<br>
to Fig. 2 has been used as the original, this method provides a plurality of tonal<br>
values which are converted into corresponding engraving depths.<br>
In contrast to known rotogravure printing plates, the inventive engraved areas for<br>
the pixels are so closely adjacent that separation is only effected via above-described<br>
separation edges. The separation edges in the plate "physically" separate the individual<br>
pixels (cells), but by printing technology they cause a direct transition from pixel to<br>
pixel despite the pasty ink. The pixels are thus not separated by unprinted bars, at best<br>
by lighter printed lines. Said lines are usually extremely fine so that they are inconspicuous<br>
in the printed image. The thus produced image is shown in Fig. 5b, the individual<br>
boxes already being assigned the corresponding tonal values here. The light<br>
lines in Fig. 5b indicate how the separation edges are set during engraving of the plate<br>
and how the partial surfaces are adjacent in the printed image. They do not stand for<br>
fully unprinted lines.<br>
To guarantee the clarity of the representation, the shown screen is relatively<br>
coarse. The image converted via partial surfaces with certain tonal values will therefore<br>
appear relatively abstract. If a more precise copy is to be produced, a screen with<br>
a substantially smaller screen width will of course be selected so that the produced<br>
pixels are much smaller and less perceived as individual boxes by the human eye.<br>
Example 3<br>
The example illustrated in Fig. 6, Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b is based, like Example 2, on<br>
the use of a pixel screen. The difference, however, is that not the classic halftone image<br>
from Fig. 2 is superimposed with the screen, but the halftone image from Fig. 3<br>
constructed from halftone separations.<br>
As in Example 2, each individual pixel is assigned a certain tonal value. Since<br>
the original is limited to five tonal values, the image converted into pixels also has<br><br>
only five tonal values, as shown in Fig. 6a. That is, the image is constructed here from<br>
a defined number of tonal values and according engraving depths.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the halftone image from five tonal-value separations superimposed<br>
with the pixel screen. Fig. 6a shows detail "x" indicated in Fig. 6 wherein tonal values<br>
have already been assigned to the pixels. Fig. 6b shows the printed image associated<br>
with Fig. 6a, one pixel corresponding to one partial surface 12.<br>
The remarks under Example 2 apply analogously here.<br>
Example 4<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, partial surfaces are again defined here starting out from the<br>
halftone separations according to Fig. 4, said surfaces being produced from the picture<br>
motif itself. They are represented by black lines 11. Said partial surfaces are then superimposed<br>
by the classic halftone image according to Fig. 2.<br>
The individual partial surfaces can then be assigned certain tonal values which, in<br>
contrast to Example 1, are not limited to five tonal values but can correspond to a plurality<br>
of tonal values in the original. That is, black partial surfaces 6, 6' and 6" are not,<br>
as in Example 1, realized exclusively as black partial surfaces 6 but can be further differentiated<br>
by different dark-gray to black tonal values. The same holds for dark-gray<br>
partial surfaces 7 and T and medium-gray partial surfaces 8 and 8'. It is additionally<br>
not only possible to assign a partial surface a very specific tonal value, but also possible<br>
to represent tonal-value patterns within a partial surface. Said patterns can be realized<br>
in the printing plate by printing technology with the aid of inclined planes, which<br>
might be additionally equipped with separation bars or ink trap bars, as explained for<br>
Example 8 and Fig. 14.<br>
Example 5<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, a line screen can be used, alternatively to the pixel screen,<br>
for dividing the halftone original according to Fig. 3 superimposed therewith into<br>
closely adjacent strips 13. In this variant the original is superimposed with horizontal<br>
parallel lines 11. In this case, however, each strip is not assigned a uniform tonal<br><br>
value, but the tonal value varies within a strip according to the tonal-value separations<br>
produced in step 2 if the tonal-value separations vary along the strip. A partial surface<br>
is thus limited on the right and left as well as top and bottom by separating lines 11, or<br>
in the printing plate by separation edges. Delimitation to the left and right results from<br>
the picture motif and extends along the surfaces having a certain tonal value; the separating<br>
lines at the top and bottom result from the superimposed line screen. Partial surfaces<br>
that do not fill a line over the whole width are either averaged over the line width<br>
and then assigned to the particular tonal values in accordance with the average, or they<br>
are delimited with separating lines within the strip, as shown.<br>
Fig. 8a shows the section designated "x" in Fig. 8 in which three strips 13 are<br>
marked by way of example. Fig. 8b shows the printed image corresponding to section<br>
"X"<br>
The light borders of the partial surfaces in Fig. 8b serve again to illustrate the exact<br>
dimensions of the partial surfaces and indicate the use of separation edges in the<br>
printing plate.<br>
The strips and the areas within the strips that have been assigned different tonal<br>
values are separated by means of separation edges here. If the lines of the line screen<br>
extend at right angles to the wiping direction of the wiping cylinder or blade, this division<br>
will probably suffice. If the line screen extends along the wiping direction, longer<br>
partial areas within the strips that are assigned to a tonal value might have to be interrupted<br>
with further separation edges in order to prevent ink from "splashing out" during<br>
the printing operation. The separation edges might produce thin, light printed lines<br>
in the later printed image. If this is to be avoided, so-called "ink trap elements" can be<br>
provided within the screen lines also in the area of the plate surface, as described for<br>
Example 8 and Fig. 14. They do not protrude as far as the plate surface and are less<br>
conspicuous in the later printed image than separation edges.<br>
Example 6<br>
The variant shown in Fig. 9 differs from the embodiment described in Example 5<br>
and Figs. 8 to 8b in that the original superimposed with a line screen is not an image<br><br>
based on halftone separations according to Figure 3 but the classic halftone image according<br>
to Fig. 2. The partial surfaces are delimited at the top and bottom by individual<br>
lines 11, as in Example 5, whereby any number of tonal values can be present in the<br>
individual lines, as clearly visible in Fig. 9a. The tonal-value pattern within a strip is<br>
realized by printing technology using a printing plate in which inclined planes are engraved<br>
within a strip that is in turn delimited from the next strip by separation edges.<br>
Due to the inclined plane in the printing plate, a continuously increasing or decreasing<br>
ink layer thickness is produced on the data carrier, which a viewer perceives as a continuously<br>
lightening or darkening tonal value. As described in Example 5, separation<br>
edges within the individual strips are also recommendable. It is additionally possible to<br>
engrave ink trap structures in order to prevent running or splashing between the tonalvalue<br>
areas and lines. The light lines in Fig. 9b show the partial surfaces in the printed<br>
image delimited from each other by separation edges.<br>
Example 7<br>
Fig. 10 shows a variant in which the partial surfaces are defined by free graphic<br>
design of the original. The inventive image is determined not by mathematically ascertained<br>
tonal-value separations from the photographic original, but by design-oriented<br>
division of the original into partial surfaces. Means of design, such as shading, colors,<br>
etc., are realized by tonal values and partial surfaces. Fig. 10 shows in stylized form<br>
the portrait detail shown in Fig. 2, using four tonal values, namely white (10), light<br>
gray (9), dark gray (7) and black (6).<br>
Example 8<br>
In contrast to eyebrow "y" shown in Fig. 10, which is represented as an amorphous<br>
black surface in the simplest printed image variant, Figs. 10a and 10b show different<br>
embodiments of eyebrow "y" equipped with motif-dependent fine structures. In<br>
the corresponding printing plate, not only a depression corresponding to the eyebrow<br>
is therefore engraved but also an additional roughness pattern producing the desired<br>
fine structures in the printed image.<br><br>
The form and guidance of the engraving tool can be used to produce said roughness<br>
pattern at the base of the partial surfaces produced by the engraving, said pattern<br>
firstly serving as an ink trap for the ink and secondly influencing the gloss and visual<br>
impression of the printed or embossed image parts. The basic roughness pattern is produced<br>
at the base of the cleared surfaces during engraving of the printing plate for example<br>
by the method described in WO 97/48555. If the partial surfaces have dimensions<br>
as of a length and width of about 100 microns, an ink trap is expedient for example.<br>
Engraving tools with a large tip radius and round geometry and closely adjacent<br>
clearing paths (for example about 10 microns) achieve smooth engravings that produce<br>
smooth and tendentially rather reflective print areas or embossings. If a small tip radius<br>
with pointed cutting-edge geometry and further-spaced clearing paths (for example<br>
in the magnitude of more than 50 microns) are selected for the engraving tool,<br>
however, one obtains rough, structured engravings that produce a matt and diffusely<br>
scattering print area or embossing.<br>
The roughness pattern can be executed uniformly in the total printed image, on<br>
the one hand, but it is also possible to change the clearing direction in individual partial<br>
areas when engraving depressions in the printing or embossing plate. Engravings<br>
formed along clearing paths that are linear but rotated for example by 90° produce<br>
visually distinguishable print areas or embossings with different light reflection. The<br>
same applies to engravings with straight or meandering clearing paths in comparison<br>
to spiral-shaped or concentric clearing paths. These effects can not only be used for<br>
more appealing or striking design of the blind embossing or print, but simultaneously<br>
also increase forgery-proofness. This selectively applied engraving technique can be<br>
used to superimpose fine structures selectively on the printed or embossed area that<br>
e.g. graphically support the image information but are only clearly recognizable at certain<br>
viewing or reflection angles or when viewed with a magnifying glass.<br>
If the abovementioned fine structures are selected as shown in Figs. 10a and 10b,<br>
the mere way of engraving the plate can produce e.g. the eyebrow hairs in the form of<br>
a fine structure additionally in the area of the eyebrow. In Fig. 10a the engraving tool<br>
has been guided concentrically along the contours of the partial surface to be cleared,<br><br>
while in Fig. 10b the engraving tool has been guided on parallel lines. Other structures,<br>
such as oblique Hatching, cross screens, etc., are likewise possible.<br>
Example 9<br>
As explained at the outset, the inventive halftone image already has a certain tactility<br>
due to the different ink layer thicknesses and embossings of the paper substrate in<br>
the area of different tonal values. If the tactility in the inventive printed image is to be<br>
increased further, the printed image produced e.g. according to Examples 1 to 8 can be<br>
equipped with additional tactile structures. Said structures are taken into account in the<br>
engraving of the intaglio printing plate, so that only one printing operation is necessary<br>
in this variant too. The size of the structural elements, their tonal value and arrangement<br>
are to be regarded in the individual case and oriented toward the desired tactile<br>
and visual effects.<br>
Fig. 11 schematically shows inventive printed image 20 consisting of a gray<br>
wedge and additional tactile structural elements. The gray wedge has four squares 21,<br>
22, 23, 24 with four different tonal values. Each square has an edge length of e.g. 5<br>
millimeters and corresponds to one partial surface.<br>
This "halftone image" is already tactilely perceptible due to the relief structure of<br>
the printed image. Since the gray values extend continuously from "dark" to "light,"<br>
the beginning of the gray wedge, i.e. the black edge, can be readily detected tactilely.<br>
However, the further steps cannot be felt as well since they slope and change only in<br>
small steps. Smaller black circles 25, 26, 27, 28 are now integrated into the squares in<br><br>
the basic motif as additional tactile structural elements. The additional structural elements<br>
are engraved much deeper than would be necessary for representing the tonal<br>
value "black." They thus have a higher relief amplitude than black partial surface 21 of<br>
the gray wedge. Structural elements 25 to 28 thus stand in the square partial surfaces<br>
like "knobs." "Knobs" and partial surfaces are delimited by separation edges in the<br>
printing plate and appear in exact register in the printed image. They are readily feelable<br>
from all directions in all partial surfaces, even the black ones, regardless of contrast<br>
or gray-value pattern. Element 25 has optically the same tonal value as square 21<br>
but is perceptible only tactilely, not visually. Not only circles but also other elements<br>
such as squares, letters, etc., can of course be used as additional tactile structural elements.<br>
Individual elements can be disposed at will in the basic motif. In the present<br>
case a tactile structural element is centered in each partial surface. But a tactile structural<br>
element can equally well be present only in every second or third square. Structural<br>
elements can vary not only in form but also in size. They can also have different<br>
tonal values.<br>
In a further embodiment, the partial surfaces described in Example 1 and Fig. 4<br>
can for example be delimited concretely from each other by borders that are tactile and<br>
possibly also visible in the printed image. The black and invisible lines described in<br>
Example 1 and Fig. 4 are tactile and visually perceptible in this variant. They are preferably<br>
lines with very dark tonal values, especially preferably black. This has the advantage<br>
that said lines are relatively easily perceptible tactilely in the printed image<br>
and can be used as additional tactile structural elements. The lines themselves can for<br>
example vary in thickness; they can also be used only in a partial area of the picture<br>
motif.<br>
Tactility is advantageously increased by structural elements having a darker tonal<br>
value than the adjoining partial surface, since a darker tonal value at the same time<br>
means a greater amplitude composed of ink layer thickness and embossing, and can<br>
thus be easily perceived tactilely. However, lighter tonal values are also possible. In<br>
this case it has a positive effect on tactility if the structural elements with the lighter<br>
tonal values are not selected too small, since they are usually less marked and thus<br>
harder to detect tactilely than structural elements standing out from the printed image<br><br>
surface. In the present example, the tactile structural elements are perceptible partly<br>
only tactilely and partly tactilely and simultaneously visually. Structural element 25<br>
perceptible only tactilely is integrated into first basic square 21. Here, both the structural<br>
element and the basic square have the tonal value, black, the structural element<br>
having been produced with a deeper engraving and thus having a higher amplitude<br>
than the basic square. Structural element and basic square have different ink layer thicknesses,<br>
the ink layer thicknesses being selected so great that the ink is no longer<br>
transparent, so that structural element and basic square have the same tonal value and<br>
are visually indistinguishable in a front view. At a glancing angle the tactile elements<br>
might nevertheless be visible due to the different shadow cast, depending on the design,<br>
even if they are not distinguishable from the background in a front view. In this<br>
case, tactile structural elements can be used to incorporate information visible at a<br>
glancing angle, which can serve as an additional authenticity feature. If an additional<br>
invisible tactile structure is desired, structural elements must thus be selected that have<br>
the same tonal value as their surroundings but a tactilely distinguishable relief.<br>
Since tactile perception is a subjective sensation, a value as of which a relief is<br>
perceived tactilely can only be determined within rough limits. Tactile perceptibility of<br>
a printed relief depends not only on absolute relief height and individual sensitivity but<br>
also on the superficial extent of the printed structure and on whether the printed structure<br>
to be felt stands alone or is integrated into relief-like surroundings.<br>
However, the following data can be given as rough guidelines. A printed relief<br>
produced by intaglio printing is tactile below a relief height of about 50 microns. Relief<br>
areas between about 50 microns and 60 microns are readily feelable. At relief amplitudes<br>
greater than 60 microns the intaglio relief is clearly feelable.<br>
Fig. 11 a shows inventive intaglio printing plate 30 for producing a printed image<br>
as shown in Fig. 11 along cutting line A - A. Engraved areas 31, 32, 33 and 34 each<br>
correspond to a square with an incorporated tactile structural element. The particular<br>
squares as well as the structural elements are delimited from each other with the aid of<br>
separation edges 39 not reaching as far as the plate surface. An ink trap is additionally<br><br>
incorporated in area 34, being shown as a zigzag pattern and producing a surface texture<br>
in square 24 (see Fig. lib).<br>
Fig. 41 b shows a cross section of data carrier 40 with the printed image shown in<br>
Fig. 11 along cutting line A - A. Substrate 50 has embossings of the paper substrate<br>
and ink layers of different extent in dependence on the engraving depth in the printing<br>
plate. In the area of black basic square 21 there is very strong embossing with thicker<br>
inking 41. Both the embossing and inking 42, 43, 44 decrease for squares 22, 23, 24<br>
lighter in tonal value and to the right thereof. Additional tactile structural elements 25,<br>
26, 27, 28 are recognizable as humps of different height.<br>
It must be heeded that a relief on the data carrier surface does not identically<br>
match the engraving depth of the printing plate. The surface relief shown in Fig. 11b is<br>
shown in idealized form. The surface relief produced by printing is composed of a<br>
compression of substrate material and the applied ink layer. The total height of the relief<br>
is based on the normal, i.e. unprinted and unembossed, data carrier surface. In<br>
practice, the relief produced on the substrate differs very clearly from the engraving in<br>
the printing plate. The reason for the deviations between engraving depth and relief<br>
height is that the data carrier is not pressed down to the base of the printing plate engraving<br>
during the printing operation and the ink in the depressions of the plate is also<br>
not transferred completely to the data carrier. Accordingly, the engraving depth of the<br>
plate for relief structures is in the range of about 40 microns to 250 microns, preferably<br>
in the range of about 55 microns to 150 microns. It produces relief structures in the<br>
range of about 5 microns to 100 microns, preferably 25 to 80 microns. Whether an engraving<br>
depth in the fringe range leads to a rather relief-like or rather flat print on the<br>
surface of a data carrier also depends in the individual case on the flank steepness of<br>
the engraving, the nature of the substrate being printed (strength, plastic deformability)<br>
and the ink properties.<br>
Since the relief height achieved in the printing result depends not only on the engraving<br>
depth of the printing plate but also on the properties of the substrate and the<br>
ink, as mentioned above, an engraving depth of 40 microns can in extreme cases already<br>
lead to a relief print, while with different material and printing parameters an<br><br>
engraving depth of 50 microns can still lead to a flat print. In each specific case of application,<br>
however, the engravings leading to relief printed image areas are always<br>
deeper than those producing so-called flat, nontactile image areas.<br>
Example 10<br>
The following Figures 12 to 14 describe by way of example inventive printing<br>
plates and printed data carriers. The remarks thereon, in particular general descriptions<br>
of the inventive idea, are of course not limited to these special variants.<br>
Figs. 12 to 14 schematically show by way of example details of an engraved surface<br>
of inventive intaglio printing plate 60 for possibly producing a printed image according<br>
to Fig. 4. Depression 61 in the plate has a very great engraving depth and produces<br>
a section shown e.g. black in the printed image. Directly beside it, separated by<br>
separation edge 39, there is engraved area 62 with a smaller engraving depth, which appears<br>
e.g. light-gray in the printed image. The light-gray partial surface is followed by<br>
a medium-gray partial surface that corresponds to engraved area 63 in the plate. The<br>
following dark-gray area corresponds to wide area 64 again engraved more deeply in<br>
the plate. After area 65 producing the tonal value, medium gray, the engraved area<br>
ends with surface 66 appearing light-gray in the printed image. All engraved areas 61<br>
to 66 are delimited by separation edges 39. The printing plate shown in Fig. 13 corresponds<br>
to the plate shown in Fig. 12., the difference being that area 66 has been additionally<br>
equipped with an ink trap due to its width, as indicated with a zigzag pattern at<br>
the base of the engraving.<br>
Printed data carrier 70 corresponding to said printing plates is shown in cross<br>
section in Fig. 14. Substrate 50, bank-note paper here, is printed with transparent intaglio<br>
ink and deformed accordingly by the printing operation. As explained above, deep<br>
engravings in the plate produce greatly embossed areas with great inking, while less<br>
deeply engraved areas emboss the data carrier less greatly, i.e. deform it less, and less<br>
ink is also transferred from the plate to the data carrier in said areas. The area designated<br>
61 in Fig. 1 2 corresponds to area 71 in Fig. 14. The great embossing and thick<br>
inking are clearly recognizable. Indentation 79 to the right thereof was produced by<br>
separation edge 39. Light-gray printed area 72 with less inking than in area 71 is seam-<br><br>
seamlessly connected to black area 71 in the printed image despite the separation edge.<br>
Areas 73 and 75 appearing medium-gray are in turn printed and embossed to a greater<br>
extent. Embossed much more greatly and covered with a thicker ink layer, area 74 appears<br>
dark-gray in the printed image. Area 76 is only slightly embossed and due to the<br>
small ink layer thickness it appears light-gray in the printed image. The printed image<br>
surface shows in the depicted area a distinctive relief structure composed of the embossing<br>
and the inking. Said relief structure is easily feelable even to the layman, and a<br>
clearly detectable security criterion.<br><br>

10.	 A data carrier as claimed in one of claims 7 to 9, wherein the tactile<br>
structural element is not perceptible visually.<br>
11.	 A data carrier as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein at least a<br>
portion of the partial surfaces is equipped with a roughness pattern that causes<br>
visually distinguishable light reflection.<br>
12.	 A data carrier as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the halftone<br>
image has fine structures superimposed thereon at least in partial areas, which<br>
influences its visual appearance and have different orientation in individual<br>
partial surfaces.<br>
13.	 An intaglio printing plate for printing a halftone image representing a motif<br>
three-dimensionally by means of at least one engraved area in the printing plate<br>
surface, characterized in that the engraved area has, at least in partial area,<br>
directly adjacent partial surfaces with a certain engraving depth, wherein partial<br>
surfaces with at least three different engraving depths are present.<br>
14.	 An intaglio printing plate as claimed in claim 13, wherein same of the<br>
directly adjacent partial surfaces have the same engraving depths.<br>
15.	 A data carrier printed with the printing plate as claimed in claim 13 or<br>
claim 14.<br><br>
16. A method for producing a data carrier having a halftone image comprising<br>
the following steps:<br>
(a)	 providing a data carrier material,<br>
(b)	 producing an intaglio printing plate as claimed in claim 13 or claim<br>
14, and<br>
(c)	 printing the data carrier material with the intaglio printing plate<br>
produced in step (b).<br>
17. A method for producing an intaglio printing plate as claimed in claim 13 or<br>
claim 14 comprising the following steps:<br>
(a)	 converting a halftone original representing a motif three-<br>
dimensionally into partial surfaces,<br>
(b)	 assigning certain tonal values to the individual partial surfaces,<br>
(c)	 assigning certain engraving depths to the tonal values, and<br>
(d)	 engraving the partial surfaces with the assigned engraving depth<br>
into the printing plate surface.<br><br>
A data carrier (1) having at least one halftone image produced by intaglio<br>
printing and representing a motif three-dimensionally, characterized in that the<br>
halftone image includes directly adjacent printed partial surfaces in at least a<br>
partial area of the image, said partial surfaces having certain tonal values with at<br>
least three printed partial surfaces having different tonal values, wherein at least<br>
a partial area of the image is tactilely perceptible.</td>
