				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a) Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to invisible zipper and, more particularly, to a bottom open-end type invisible zipper, which has a movable bottom-end piece that can be moved away from the stitching area when using a sewing machine to stitch the zipper to an object (a)    Description of the Prior Art:<br>
A regular bottom open-end type invisible zipper (see FIG.l) is generally comprised of two zipper tapes 10, two series of teeth, two plug members 30, and a bottom-end piece 40. The two series of teeth and the two plug members 30 are respectively fixedly fastened to the zipper tapes 10. The bottom-end piece 40 is fixedly fastened to one plug member 30. The structure of bottom open-end type invisible zipper is suitable for use to close/open an opening in a dress, jacket, etc. When closing, the other plug member is inserted into the bottom-end piece 40, and then the slide is pulled upwards to interlock the two series of teeth. However, because the dimension of the bottom-end piece 40 is much greater than the cross section of the series of teeth, the presser foot 100 of the sewing machine cannot pass over the bottom-end piece when<br>
1 A<br><br>
fastening the zipper tapes 10 to a dress or the like (see FIG. 2). In order to eliminate the aforesaid problem, an invisible zipper with detachable bottom-end piece is disclosed. According to this design, one plug member 30 is constructed having a split hook 301, and the bottom-end piece 40 is made having hooked portions 402 disposed in one insertion hole 401 for engagement with the split hook 301 after insertion of the plug member 30 into the insertion hole 401. The bottom-end piece 40 is separated from the corresponding plug member 30 before fastening the zipper tapes 10 to the dress or the like. After installation of the invisible zipper, the bottom-end piece 40 is secured to the split hook 301 of the plug member 30. Because the plug member 30 and the bottom-end piece 40 are small elements, it is complicated to form the designed split hook 301 on the plug member 30 and the designed hooked portions 402 in the bottom-end piece 40. Any small error during die-casting or injection molding procedure causes a defective product. Further: because the bottom-end piece 40 is kept separated from the invisible zipper when selling, it tends to be missed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is the main object of the present invention to provide a bottom open-end type invisible zipper, which has a movable   bottom-end   piece   that   does   not   hinder   the   stitching<br><br>
operation to fasten the invisible zipper to an object. According to one aspect of the present invention, the bottom open-end type invisible zipper comprises a first zipper tape and a second zipper tape, the zipper tapes each having a respective series of teeth longitudinally disposed at an inner side for interlocking; a first plug member and a second plug member respectively fixedly fastened to the zipper tapes and longitudinally connected to one end of the series of teeth at the respective zipper tape; a movable bottom-end piece slidably coupled to the first zipper tape, the movable bottom-end piece having a receiving chamber adapted to receive the first plug member and the second plug member in parallel; and an escape-preventive structure adapted to stop the movable bottom-end piece from falling out of the first zipper tape, the escape-preventive structure including a male locating means fixedly disposed at the first plug member and a female locating means fixedly disposed at the second plug member for engagement with the male locating means to stop the movable bottom-end piece at the first plug member. According to another aspect of the present invention, the first plug member with the first zipper tape and the second plug member with the second zipper tape can be selectively arranged at either side to fit the left-handed user or the right-handed user.

The teeth 11 of each zipper tape 1 can be independent metal teeth respectively fastened to the fabric body of the respective zipper tape. Alternatively, the teeth 11 of each zipper tape 1 can be a continuous series of loop directly<br><br>
molded from resin on the fabric body of the respective zipper tape. The teeth 11 each have a protruding upper face for interlocking. Each zipper tape 1 has a peripheral flap that keeps the respective series of teeth 11 from sight.<br>
The plug member set 2 (see Fig. 6) includes a male plug member 21 and a female plug member 22. The male plug member 21 and female plug member 22 can be made of metal by die casting or stamping, and then respectively fixedly fastened to the zipper tapes 1 at one end of the respective series of teeth 11. Alternatively, the male plug member 21 and the female plug member 22 can be injection-molded from plastics on the respective zipper tapes 1. The male plug member 21 comprises a longitudinal coupling groove 211, a protruding flange 212 downwardly extended from the top sidewall thereof and longitudinally disposed at an outer side of the longitudinal coupling groove 211, and an end notch 213 at the top end thereof. The female plug member 22 comprises a longitudinal coupling groove 221, and a protruding flange 222 downwardly extended from the top sidewall thereof and longitudinally disposed at an outer side of the longitudinal coupling groove 221. When the male plug member 21 and the female plug member 22 are attached together, the tail end of the series of teeth 11 in front of the female plug member 22 is engaged into the end notch 213 of the male plug member 21.<br><br>
The movable bottom-end piece 3 (see FIGS. From 8 through 11) is shaped like a rectangular case comprising a receiving chamber 31 extended through front and rear sides thereof and adapted to receive the male plug member 21 and the female plug member 22, a vertical rear stop wall 32 disposed at the rear side of the receiving chamber 31 and adapted to stop the female plug member 22, a top slot 33 longitudinally cut through the top sidewall thereof. The top slot 33 has a relatively wider front half and a relatively narrower rear half.<br>
The aforesaid escape-preventive structure (see FIGS. 7 and 9) comprises a locating block 223 formed integral with the top surface of the top sidewall of the male plug member 21, and a locating groove 34 formed on the inside wall of the movable bottom-end piece 3 and adapted to receive the locating block 223. The locating groove 34 can have a triangular, wedge-like, or rectangular shape. The shape of locating block 223 fits the locating groove 34. When moving the movable bottom-end piece 3 along the series of teeth 11 on one zipper tape 1 to the bottom limit position, the locating groove 34 is forced into engagement with the locating block 223, and therefore the movable bottom-end piece 3 is stopped from escaping out of the zipper tape in which the female plug member 22 is installed. Further, the engagement between the locating groove 34 and the locating block 223 keeps the female<br>
8<br><br>
plug member 22 positively positioned in the receiving chamber 31 of the movable bottom-end piece 3.<br>
The assembly process of the present invention is outlined hereinafter with reference to FIGS, from 5 through 7. The male plug member 21 and the female plug member 22 are respectively fixedly fastened to the zipper tapes 1 at the rear end of the respective inner side, and the series of teeth 11 are respectively installed in the zipper tapes 1 above the respective plug members 21 and 22, keeping the series of teeth 11 and the male plug member 21 at one zipper tape in match with the series of teeth 11 and the female plug member 22 at the other zipper tape, and then the movable bottom-end piece 3 is sleeved onto the front side (top end) of the series of teeth 11 at the zipper tape in which the female plug member 22 is installed, and then the movable bottom-end piece 3 is pulled downwards along the corresponding series of teeth 11 toward the female plug member 22 to force the locating groove 34 into engagement with the locating block 223 (see FIG. 7), and then the slide 5 is sleeved onto the front side (top end) of the series of teeth 11 at the zipper tape in which the female plug member 22 is installed, and then the slide 5 is pulled downwards and sleeved onto the female plug member 22 and stopped at the front side of the movable bottom-end piece 3, and then the male plug member 21 at the  other  zipper tape  1   is  inserted  through the  slide  5  into the<br><br>
receiving chamber 31 of the movable bottom-end piece 3. After the male plug member 21 has been inserted through the slide 5 into the receiving chamber 31 of the movable bottom-end piece 3 and stopped at the vertical stop wall 32. the slide 5 can then be. pulled upwards to interlock the series of teeth 11 of the zipper tapes 1 and to close the invisible zipper (see FIG. 5).<br>
When closing the invisible zipper, the male plug member 21 is inserted through the slide 5 into the receiving chamber 31 of the movable bottom-end piece 3 and abutted against the female plug member 22 at one side, and then the slide 5 is pulled upwards to interlock the series of teeth 11 at the two zipper tapes 1, keeping the male and female plug members 21 and 22 positioned in the movable bottom-end piece 3 (see FIG. 12).<br>
As indicated above, the movable bottom-end piece 3 can be moved along the series of teeth 11 at the zipper tape 1 in which the female plug member 22 is installed. During stitching after opening of the invisible zipper, the user can move the movable bottom-end piece 3 away from the stitching area, enabling the zipper tapes 1 to be conveniently fastened to the garment, bag, or the like. After installation, the movable bottom-end piece 3 is prohibited from falling out of the invisible zipper.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18, the movable bottom-end piece 3 can be made having a longitudinal rib 35 and a stop flange<br>
