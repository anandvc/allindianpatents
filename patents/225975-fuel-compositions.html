				<td>FUEL COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to liquid fuel compositions such as those<br>
which may be used in internal combustion engines<br>
Environmental pollution from exhaust gases from engines, such as those used in<br>
automobiles, is a widespread problem. Various liquid fuel compositions have been tried<br>
in an effort to reduce such pollution. For example, it has been tried to form fuels from<br>
mixtures of naphtha or gasoline with methanol or other alcohols. Such fuels can greatly<br>
reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons in the exhaust<br>
gases. They can also replace conventional gasoline fuel.<br>
When selecting a fuel composition, a number of factors must be considered. The<br>
fuel must be readily converted into energy by the engine In an internal combustion<br>
engine, this means the fuel must have some volatility and must not be too viscous. The<br>
fuel must have good performance, that is, it must combust readily to give good<br>
acceleration to a vehicle. Preferably it should be stable, so that it does not separate on<br>
standing and does not chemically react with engine components during storage. It should<br>
be non-corrosive so that it does not damage the engine supply lines or storage vessels.<br>
The combustion products which will appear in the exhaust gases should be as low as<br>
possible in substances which are toxic or harmful to health or environment.<br>
Although conventional gasoline does meet some of the above objectives, it is not<br>
a renewable resource. Thus it would also be desirable to find a fuel composition which<br>
was derived at least partly, from a renewable resource.<br>
Although prior art fuels, which contain naphtha or gasoline mixed with methanol,<br>
ethanol or other alcohols do have a small effect in reducing the concentrations of carbon<br>
monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases from automobiles, they have<br>
other problems. Since they contain unstabilized alcohols and ethers, they can cause<br>
problems such as swollen rubber gaskets, decomposition of rubber, engine parts<br>
corrosion and wear, reduced performance affecting fuel consumption and driveability<br><br>
index, oxidation stability and increased NOx values to name a few. Such fuels are also<br>
known to break down and degenerate during storage or at high temperature and may<br>
cause a build-up of gum residue on engine parts. In addition, these fuels are usually<br>
unable to operate once water is added to them, as the water does not properly dissolve in<br>
the fuel and tends to separate back out of the mixture after only a short time which in<br>
turn causes engine stalling and poor performance.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide an emission reducing liquid fuel, which<br>
avoids or reduces some of the above problems and is therefore better for the<br>
environment. The present invention seeks to provide an improved emission reducing<br>
liquid fuel capable of efficiency and an output similar 1o or better than that of<br>
conventional gasoline, without any need to modify existing internal combustion gasoline<br>
engines. The invention also seeks to reduce the concentrations of carbon monoxide<br>
(CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate<br>
matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and total hydrocarbons (THC) in<br>
exhaust gases as compared to conventional gasoline.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that fuel compositions which contain at least some water<br>
can outperform other fuel compositions, at least in some respects. The fuel composition<br>
of the invention not only can include water without separation of the components but can<br>
also improve the power of the fuel. Further, NOx and other emissions can be reduced,<br>
the composition can have improved oxidation stability and can reduce, by way of pH<br>
balancing, corrosion and wear. It further enables a way of using, in a new way, biomass<br>
products which might not otherwise be useful.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a liquid fuel<br>
composition comprising: 10-80 vol% of a first component comprising at least two<br>
aliphatic organic non-hydrocarbon compounds; 20-65 vol% of a second component<br>
comprising at least one hydrocarbon and having an aromatic content of less than 15<br>
vol% of the total of the second component; 1-35 vol% of a third component, which<br>
comprises an oxygenate; 0.01 to 20 vol% water, wherein at least one compound in the<br><br>
fuel composition is miscible with both water and hydrocarbons to provide a single phase<br>
composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The first component comprises at least two aliphatic non-hydrocarbon organic<br>
compounds. Preferably these are volatile compounds. Suitable compounds include<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and esters (such as acetates)<br>
preferably having up to about 13 carbon atoms. Compounds which form undersirable<br>
combustion products (for example, aldehydes which may form formaldehyde) are less<br>
preferred. In a conventional combustion engine, performance may be a combination of<br>
performances in a range. Thus, for example, a compound of lower boiling point may<br>
make a certain contribution to the overall performance of the fuel, but may leave another<br>
aspect of the performance lacking. The lacking aspect may be compensated or fulfilled<br>
by a compound of a different, perhaps higher, boiling point. Thus it is preferred to have<br>
several compounds in this component in the composition to represent a full range of<br>
values.<br>
The compositions can contain from 10 to 80 vol%, preferably from 30 to 50<br>
vol%, more preferably from 35 to 45 vol% of the first component. However, the<br>
quantity used will depend on many factors including the nature of the other ingredients,<br>
availability and cost.<br>
Although in some cases as little as 10 vol% of the first component may be used,<br>
more preferably the fuel composition has at least 35 vol% of the first component.<br>
Compounds suitable for the first component may be derived from any source,<br>
such as petroleum, natural gas, coal or bio feedstock. One suitable source of compounds<br>
for the first component is recycled solvents.<br>
Use of the first component can thus reduce corrosion and undesirable products<br>
such as CO, CO2, HxCy, SOx, NOx, THC, VOC, aromatics etc. contained in the<br>
exhaust gases of automobiles.<br>
It is preferable that at least one compound of the first component is an aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol which is a non-straight chain alcohol.<br><br>
The use of a non-straight chain or branched aliphatic alcohol can contribute to<br>
obtaining a higher octane value and also can facilitate blending of the components<br>
without separation.<br>
Preferred compounds for use in the first component include ethyl alcohol, propyl<br>
alcohol, butyl alcohol, octyl alcohol, butanone, methyl isobutyl ketone and ethyl acetate.<br>
Preferred branched aliphatic alcohols include isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and<br>
isobutyl alcohol (IBA).<br>
Although many different compounds may be used as compounds for the first<br>
component, some, such as methyl alcohol (which tends to be quite corrosive) are less<br>
preferred or are preferably avoided or only used in lesser quantities.<br>
The compositions need at least one compound which is mutually miscible with<br>
both water and hydrocarbons to ensure that, after blending, the components combine as a<br>
single phase. Compounds suitable for use as the first component, for example alcohols,<br>
especially higher alcohols such as decanol, will often provide such mutual miscibility<br>
and can thus function as mutually miscible compounds.<br>
The second component is the hydrocarbon component. It is preferred that this<br>
component is low in aromatic content, (i.e., compounds such as benzene, toluene and<br>
xylene) at least less than 15 vol%, preferably less than 10 vol%. Aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
tend to be imperfectly combusted. Thus, by reducing the aromatic content the COx and<br>
hydrocarbon content in the exhaust can be reduced, as well as reducing the exhaust<br>
aromatic content. Further, it is believed that the aromatic content contributes to negative<br>
properties of a fuel composition, such as the corrosiveness, and thus a lower aromatic<br>
content is preferred.<br>
The hydrocarbons may be saturated or unsaturated and may be derived from any<br>
source such as petroleum, natural gas, coal or bio-feedstock. Thus they may be mixtures<br>
of various hydrocarbons, the hydrocarbons are preferably straight chain. Light naphthas<br>
are suitable. Some types of gasoline would also be suitable.<br>
The compositions can contain from 20 to 65 vol%, preferably from 40 to 55<br>
vol%, more preferably from 45 to 50 vol%, of the hydrocarbon component.<br><br>
The specifications of an example of a suitable light naphtha for the second<br>
component are shown below:<br><br>
Further, straight-chain saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons whose number of<br>
carbon atoms is 9 or less may be used in place of all or a part of the low aromatic<br>
naphtha for the second component.<br>
The third component comprises at least one oxygenate. Oxygenates are usually<br>
compounds which contain oxygen and which can provide a source of oxygen during<br>
combustion to assist in the complete combustion of the carbon content of the other<br>
compounds in the fuel composition and can reduce the content of carbon monoxide in the<br>
exhaust.<br>
The compositions can contain from 1 to 35% of the third component, preferably<br>
from 5 to 20 vol%, more preferably from 8 to 15 vol%.<br>
Suitable compounds are compounds such as ethers which generally have at least<br>
two hydrocarbon groups which each have seven, preferably six, or less carbon atoms in<br>
the hydrocarbon chain. Preferred ethers include methylcyclopentadienyl manganese<br><br>
tricarbonyl (MMT), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether<br>
(TAME) ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) and dibutyl ether or a similar component. Iso<br>
octane is also sometimes used as an oxygenate.<br>
In this way, the octane value of the resulting fuel can be improved by a small<br>
blended amount without compromising the integrity of the fuel, so the price of the fuel<br>
can be kept low level and lubricity can be maintained.<br>
The compositions contain at least some water, in particular from 0.01 vol% to 20<br>
vol%. It has been found not only that it is possible to use water in such fuel<br>
compositions, but also that the water can contribute to the beneficial properties of the<br>
compositions such as by reducing NOx, CO or particulate content in the exhaust.<br>
Preferably the compositions contain at least 0.05 vol%, more preferably at least 0.75<br>
vol% and particularly at least 1 vol%. It has also been found that the water may contain<br>
various dissolved or suspended substances without disabling the fuel and sometimes even<br>
enhancing the effects of the fuel.<br>
Although in some cases there may be as much as 20 vol% of water in the<br>
compositions, it is preferred that there is less than 10 vol% and more preferably, less<br>
than 5 vol% of water.<br>
The water may be derived from most sources. For example the water may be tap<br>
water, distilled water, spring or mineral water or distilled sea water. Also the water may<br>
include compounds derived from biomass or biological materials such as grass clippings,<br>
leaves, fruits and plants. Of course, some compounds, such as sugars, would be<br>
detrimental to the compositions and should be avoided. With regard to sugars, it is still<br>
possible to use aqueous solutions derived from sugar-containing material, such as fruit<br>
juice, provided the sugars are removed, such as by fermentation. Although some trials<br>
may be needed to determine limits and suitability of such additional materials, an<br>
advantage of the fuel compositions is that they do permit the use of such renewable<br>
biological materials. Thus the water may contain various water soluble compounds such<br>
as chlorophylls, lipids, proteins, phytols, carotenes, quercetin, acids (such as citric acid)<br>
and alkaline compounds. The water may also contain urea, thus if salt and mineral<br>
content is appropriately reduced or removed, urine may be used as water component.<br><br>
Compounds derived from biomass may be obtained, for example, by grinding<br>
into small pieces or mulching products such as grass clippings, leaves or fruits. Water is<br>
added together with compounds which may accelerate the breakdown of the products and<br>
the extraction of soluble compounds, the resulting mixture is pressed and filtered to<br>
obtain an aqueous solution of compounds derived from biomass.<br>
A variety of compounds may be present as additives in fuel compositions<br>
according to the invention. Thus it is frequently desirable, and sometimes necessary to<br>
adjust the properties by providing one or more additives. Types of additive which may<br>
be used include: compounds which improve the miscibility of the water in the<br>
composition (water bonding agents) or help stabilize the compositions against oxidation;<br>
compounds which help adjust the pH of the compositions (pH balancing agents)<br>
preferably to bring the composition to a non-corrosive neutral pH value; compounds<br>
which reduce corrosiveness or provide lubricity (lubricants) by inhibiting reaction with<br>
or adherence to engine or storage components; compounds which help stabilize the<br>
compositions for long term storage (stabilizing agents) by reducing gum or residue build-<br>
up in carburettors and other engine parts or storage components or by prolonging the<br>
storage life of the fuel; and compounds which reduce the flash point of the compositions<br>
and thus improve their safety. Compounds useful as additives which function in one or<br>
more of the above capacities include: decanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, octyl alcohol,<br>
cyclohexane, pentane, methyl cyclohexane or similar material and micro lubricating<br>
synthetic and petroleum distillates. Petroleum distillates, also called synthetic<br>
(lubricating) distillates and petroleum lubricating distillates, provide a readily available<br>
source of compounds which can function in a lubricant or corrosion reducing capacity,<br>
for example, Octel Starreon markets a mixture of suitable synthetic lubricant distillates<br>
under the Trade name DC11.<br>
It is preferred that the volume percentage of the first component is 40% or more<br>
than that of the second component. In particular, it is preferred that the volume<br>
percentage of the first component is 50% or more that of the second component.<br>
There may be overlap between the components. That is, for example, compounds<br>
such as (lower) alcohols or esters which are suitable as the aliphatic non-hydrocarbon<br><br>
compounds of the first component may serve as an oxygenate which is the third<br>
component. Water also may sometimes serve as at least a part of the oxygenate<br>
component.<br>
Further, a non-straight chain monohydric (primary) alcohol, ketone or acetate is<br>
preferably employed as at least one compound of the first component because the<br>
polarity may be lower than that of a straight-chain alcohol and thus blending with<br>
hydrocarbon components, ethers and esters may be improved.<br>
Further, with regard to volatility and cost it is preferable to use, as the ether, an<br>
ether having two chain hydrocarbon groups whose number of carbon atoms is 6 or less.<br>
Since there is a range of suitable compounds for the components, the choice of<br>
particular compounds may be based on cost or availability.<br>
Bearing in mind that compounds containing nitrogen or sulphur as heteroatoms<br>
will tend to contribute to the concentration of NOx and SOx in the exhaust gases, it is<br>
preferred to use less of such compounds, or avoid using them.<br>
To prepare the compositions, the various components, and any desired additives,<br>
are mixed together followed by stirring, agitation or any other mechanical motion<br>
needed to blend the composition into a single phase. It is important that the compositions<br>
are stable and remain in a single phase. If any phase separation occurs it may render the<br>
composition unsuitable as a fuel. The order of mixing is generally not critical, however<br>
it will be understood that it is preferable to first mix components of similar polarity or<br>
which are mutually soluble. On the one hand, any ethers, esters, ketones and alcohols<br>
may be sequentially added to the hydrocarbon component such as low aromatic naphtha<br>
which has low polarity. On the other hand, any ethers, esters, ketones and the low<br>
aromatic naphtha may be sequentially added to any alcohol. Also the water component is<br>
preferably added first to an alcohol component. Also it is preferred to first prepare a test<br>
mix and establish the pH value of the solution, so that if any pH adjusting agent is<br>
needed to neutralize the pH, the quantity needed can be established. If the mixture is too<br>
acid it may be desirable to add an appropriate amount of an alkaline pH adjusting agent<br>
and if the mixture is too alkaline it may be desirable to add an appropriate amount of an<br>
acidic pH adjusting agent.<br><br>
As a first step in formulation, it is preferred to do a sample mix of the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohols, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and ether or ester to<br>
determine the pH value. This may vary from acidic to alkaline. With this determined,<br>
one can then adjust the water and other ingredients to appropriate levels to ensure that<br>
the final formulation has approximately a neutral pH. Use of watery fluids derived from<br>
plant based material can provide added energy value and varies from alkaline to acidic.<br>
The respective blended primary fuels can thus be effectively mixed without being<br>
separated from each other.<br>

The following tables 1 and 2 show the results of exhaust emission tests conducted<br>
on sample blends, the comparative example (Table 2) and conventional gasoline. The<br>
reduction in emissions is shown as being significant as proven on various makes and<br>
years of cars in the Ontario Drive Clean Emissions Tests (a government mandated<br>
emissions test) and Environment Canada Emissions Tests. Environment Canada tests<br>
were conducted on a 1989 Crown Victoria and al990 Plymouth Acclaim for both<br>
highway and city driving test cycles.<br>
In the following tables: ODC stands for Ontario Drive Clean which is an<br>
emissions test procedure of the Ontario provincial government of Canada; ECET stands<br>
for Environment Canada Emissions Test which is an emissions test procedure of the<br>
Environment Department of the Federal Government of Canada; where a number of a<br>
blend is referred to, such as "Blend 1", it is intended to refer to a blend of the same<br>
number as defined above in the Examples 1 to 10; "City" means the test was intended to<br>
reflect city driving conditions and "Hiway" means the test was intended to reflect<br>
highway driving conditions; "gas" or "gasoline" means that the composition tested was<br>
a conventional gasoline used for comparative purposes, since a fuel was sometimes used<br>
in engines of different make, the results in the table are sometimes different for the same<br>
blend of fuel, but the comparison with regular gasoline shown in the table, illustrates the<br>
improvements achievable by compositions of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to the above<br>
embodiment, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and it goes without<br>
saying that various modifications and additions can be made within the range, which<br>
does not depart from the gist of the invention. That is, other primary fuels and additives<br>
may be arbitrarily added within the ranges in which the characteristics of the fuels for<br>
internal combustion engines of the present invention are not greatly modified and such<br>
