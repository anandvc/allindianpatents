AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF<br>
APREPITANT<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to process for the preparation of Aprepitant. The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Aprepitant, which is chemically known as 5-[[(2R,3S)-2-[(lR)-l-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethoxy] -3-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-morpholinyl]methyl]-l,2-dihydrO-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one, having structural formula-I. <br>
Aprepitant is a useful therapeutic agent, specifically as a P (neurokinin-1) receptor antagonist useful in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is<br>
			        	 T\&gt;l<br>
commercially available in the market under the brand name EMEND TM as 80 mg or 125 mg capsules.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Aprepitant and the process for its preparation is disclosed in US patent number 5719147, The disclosed process involves the condensation of 2(R)-( 1 -(R)-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl morpholine with N-methyl carboxy-2-chloroacetamidrazone in the presence of the base N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the solvent acetonitrile. Subsequent processing by flash chromatography using methylene chloride/methanol/ammonium hydroxide as eluant in a ratio of 50:1:0.1 to provide 2(R)-(l-(R)-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(N-methylcarboxyacetamidrazono)morpholine which was cyclised by refluxing in xylene and purified by flash chromatography using methylene chloride/methanol/ammonium hydroxide as eluant in a ratio of 50:1:0.1 to provide aprepitant.<br>
 <br>
International publication number WO 01/96315 discloses the preparation of aprepitant by the condensation of the 3-chloromethyl-l,2,4-triazolin"5-one with 2(R)-(1-(R)-(3,5-bis (trifluoromethyl) phenyl) ethoxy) -3-(S)-(4-fluoro) phenyl morpholine.<br>
The general processes disclosed in the above patents result in relatively low and inconsistent yields of the desired products. Also separation of enantiomers formed and isolating the products by chromatographic techniques is difficult. And therefore it is not an ideal technique.<br>
U.S. Patent number 6,395,898 discloses the preparation of optically pure intermediate compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl morpholine which features a highly stereo selective Lewis acid catalyzed transacetylization of (R)-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl ethanol with trichlroacetamidate followed by inversion of the adjacent chiral center on the morpholine ring. The process for the preparation of the chiral alcohol (R)-3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl ethanol employs (lS,2R)-cis-l-aminoindan-2-ol and dichloro (p-cymene)Ru(II) dimer as a metal source. This route is industrially and economically not feasible because expensive raw materials such as dichloro(p-cymene)Ru(II) dimer are involved.<br>
Further, the selective substitution reactions are governed by the thermodynamic stability of the intermediates 2-(S)-(3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)-phenyl morpholine prepared by reaction of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine in the presence of carbon tetrachloride which is further treated with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride to afford 3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol, trifluromethanesulfonate ester.<br>
N-benzyl-3-(S)-phenylmorpholin-2-one was treated with lithium tri(sec-butyl)-borohydride (L-SelectrideTM) in THF at -75°C, then above obtained 3,5"bis(trifluoro methyl) benzyl alcohol, trifluromethanesulfonate ester was added, after completion of reaction it was extracted with ethyl acetate and concentrated in vacuum to afford residue. The residue was purified by flash chromatography to afford pure 4-Benzyl-2-(S)-(3,5-bis (trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenylmorpholine.<br>
 <br>
The above obtained 4-Benzyl-2-(S)-(3,5-bis (trifluoromethyl) benzyloxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro) phenylmorpholine was reduced by Pd/C. The resultant residue was purified by flash chromatography to give pure 2-(S)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-morpholine which are highly sensitive to minor process variations such as temperature, moisture, time, and rate of addition, solvent and thus the processes are practically found to be inconsistent in producing the desired stereochemistry.(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) ethanol is reacted with tricholoroimidate in toluene at below -20°C,then quenched via addition of a mixture of 10% brine to provide trans-glycoside<br>
International publication number WO 03/089429 discloses the preparation of aprepitant of Formula I which involves condensation of the hydrochloride salt of (2R,2-α-R,3S)-2-[l"(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pheny)ethoxy]-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,4-oxazine with amidrazone in presence of potassium carbonate and the organic solvents toluene and dimethylsulfoxide to give an intermediate, which on cyclization at 140°C affords aprepitant.<br>
In summary, some of the disadvantages of the foregoing processes include;<br>
i)   the purity of the isolated aprepitant is low, thereby requiring additional steps like<br>
flash chromatography, which is industrially not feasible, to obtain a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable substance; ii) the chemical yield of aprepitant is low; iii) high temperature reactions are involved iv) a lengthy time cycle is required ; and v) expensive reagents are used.<br>
As such there is a need for a process for the preparation of aprepitant that is cost effective and utilizes readily available reagents<br>
In contrast to previously known processes, the present invention provides a more efficient, practical and economical method for preparing the aprepitant in relatively high yield and purity.<br>
 <br>
Brief description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of aprepitant. Aprepitant is chemically known as 5-[[(2R,3S)-2-[(lR)-l-[3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl]ethoxy]-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-morpholinyl]methyl]-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one, represented as a compound of formula-I.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly the main feature of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of aprepitant of formula-1, which comprises of the following steps;<br>
a)	alkylation of (S)-2-(benzyl amino)-2-(4-Fluorophenyl) acetic acid (formula-II) with 1,2-dihaloethane, followed by treatment with an acid gives an acid addition salt of the compound of formula-Ill,<br>
b)	reducing the compound of formula-Ill or its salt thereof, with an active hydride reducing agent, and subsequently reacting this mixture with substituted benzoyl halide compound of formula-IV provides compound of formula-V.<br>
c)	conversion of Formula-V using "Titanium ylide" to provide an enol ether of Formula-VI,<br>
d)	reduction and debenzylation of the compound of formula-VI with suitable reducing agents and treating the compound formed with oxalic acid to provide an oxalate salt of the compound of formula-VII,<br>
e)	reacting the oxalate salt of formula-VII with N-methylcarboxyI-2-chloroacetamidrazone in presence of suitable base and suitable organic solvents to obtain a compound of formula VIII,<br>
f)	cyclising the compound of Formula-VIII, to get aprepitant (formula-I),<br>
g)	purifying the aprepitant formed in step f) to provide pure aprepitant.<br>
 <br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of Aprepitant. Aprepitant, chemically known as 5-[[(2R,3S)-2-[l(lR)-l-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]ethoxy]-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-morpholinyl]methyl]-1,2-Dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one represented as a compound of formula-I<br>
 <br>
Accordingly the main feature of the present invention is to provide a novel process for the preparation of Aprepitant compound of formula-1, which comprises of the following steps;<br>
a)  The alkylation of (S)-2-(benzylamino)-2-(4-fluorophenyl) acetic acid compound<br>
of formula II, <br>
with 1,2 dihaloethane in presence of suitable base in an organic solvent, gives a compound of formula-Ill, which on treatment with an acid provided the acid addhion salt of the compound of formula-Ill,<br>
 <br>
 <br>
b)	reducing the above compound of formula-Ill or its salt thereof, with active<br>
hydride reducing agent in presence of suitable organic solvents, reacting this<br>
mixture with substituted benzoyl halide compound of formula-IV,<br>
 <br>
to obtain compound of Formula-V,<br>
 <br>
c)	conversion of Formula-V using "Titanium ylide" in presence of organic solvents<br>
to produce an enol-ether of Formula-VI,<br>
 <br>
Formula-VI<br>
d)	reduction and debenzylation of the compound of formula VI with a suitable<br>
reducing agent in presence of suitable organic solvent, to give the free base of<br>
 <br>
compound of formula-VII, which on subsequent treatment with oxalic acid   to provide an oxalate salt of Formula-VII,<br>
 <br>
e) reacting the oxalate salt of Formula-VII with N-methylcarboxyl-2-chloro-acetamidrazone in presence of suitable bases and suitable organic solvents to obtain a compound of formula-VIII, which has been isolated as a solid with the usage of suitable organic solvent,<br>
 <br>
g) purifying the aprepitant formed in step f) to provide pure aprepitant.<br>
In the step a) compound of formula-II is alkylated with 1,2-dibromoethane in the presence of diisopropylethylamine to provide the morpolin-2-one derivative(formula-III). The reaction is carried out in toluene solvent, which improved the yield, purity and also facilitated the formation of crystalline acid addition salt of the morpholin-2-one by the<br>
 <br>
addition of an acid. The acid is selected from group consisting of hydrochloric acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, hydrogenbromide, hydrogen iodide, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, camphor sulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, benzene sulphonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid and p-chlorobenzene sulfonic acid.<br>
In the step b) the compound of formula-Ill is contacted with active hydride reagent, lithium tri(sec-butyl)-borohydride (L-selectride®) at low temperature around -78°C in toluene solvent, and the resulting intermediate is reacted with 3,5-bis (trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride (formula-IV) to provide 2,3-cis substituted product of formula-V.<br>
In the step c) the compound of formula-V is converted to its enol ether compound of formula-VI, using "titanium ylide" generated with dimethyl titanonocene (Petasis,N.A,, Bzowej,E.I., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 112, 6392 (1990)). The solvents used for the reaction are tetrahydrofuran and toluene.<br>
In the step d) the compound of formula-VI is treated with 5% Pd/C/Ha in methanol, in conditions which assisted in simultaneous reduction of the double bond and to remove the N-benzyl group on the morpholine nitrogen as well, to provide the compound of formula-VII. The processes in the prior art utilized two different reducing agents, first to reduce the double bond and second to remove the N-benzyl group on the morpholine nitrogen. Hence the present invention has been able to reduce the number reagents used in this stage. Also the use of 5% Pd/C for the reduction of the double bond provided greater yield of the required isomer. Compound of formula-VII was converted into its oxalate salt by adding oxalic acid to yield the crystalline acid addition salt with high purity. The p-toluene sulfonic acid salt of compound of formula-VII was also prepared. It has been observed that the inorganic acid salt of formula-VII were found to be hygroscopic in nature, hence were not suitable for getting high pure compound of formula-VII. The oxalate salt was found to be manifest with more salient properties like purity, crystalline nature and non hygroscopic in nature etc. when compared with p-toluene sulfonic acid salt.<br>
 <br>
In the step e) the oxalate salt of Formula-VII was treated with N-methylcarboxyl-2-chloro acetamidrazone in presence of potassium carbonate and dimethyl sulfoxide solvent to obtain a compound of formula-VIII, which was isolated as a solid using cyclohexane solvent. In the processes disclosed in prior art the compound of formula-VIII was reported as a foamy substance which was obtained as a residue on dry distillation. Isolation of the above compound by filtration from the solvent provided highly pure intermediate, which on subsequent cyclisation provided aprepitant of high purity.<br>
In the step f) the compound of Formula-VIII was taken in xylene and heated to 130°C in the presence of diisopropylethylamine to provide aprepitant of formula (I) which was isolated using a mixture of methanol and water to provide aprepitant.<br>
In the step g) the aprepitant formed in step f) is crystallized using methanol, water or a mixture thereof to provide aprepitant of high purity.<br>
The present invention provides aprepitant with particles having irregular flake morphology as illustrated in photographs of microscopic aprepitant in figure-2, which could be further micronised or milled to provide highly crystalline aprepitant.<br>
Analysis of particle size distribution of aprepitant: A Malvern laser diffraction instrument was used to characterize the particle size distribution of aprepitant. Instrument model: Malvern Mastersizer 2000 Technique used: Wet method Instrument parameters:<br>
