5     FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally providing security for electronic commerce, and<br>
more particularly to a method for minimizing the potential for unauthorized use of<br>
10     digital information, particularly software programs, digital content and other computer<br>
information. This invention can also be used in other processes, which requires<br>
authentication of the users.<br>
15     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electronic commerce, or e-commerce as it is commonly called, includes the transfer of orders or other sales communications, credit information, electronic "funds",<br>
20 and digital products. Electronic commerce has been recognized as offering the promise of providing speed and convenience to many types of commercial activities. Interest in electronic commerce has heightened with the advent of widely accessible communication systems such as the Internet. Other means for providing electronic commerce include direct telephone line connections, interactive cable or television<br>
25 services, telefacsimile services, local and wide area network communications and the like. Electronic data communications technologies, particularly the Internet, have greatly     enhanced     marketing     and     retail     opportunities     and     activities.<br>
To a large extent, the promise of electronic commerce has not been fully<br>
30     realized,  partially because of concerns with security  such as the potential for<br>
unauthorized   manipulation   of  information.   Such   unauthorized   manipulation   of<br>
information includes diverting electronic fund transfers and delivery of unauthorized<br><br>
software (also referred to as "bootleg" or "pirated" software) to unauthorized destinations.<br>
The    electronic    commerce    operations    especially    electronic    commerce<br>
5     transactions requires security as it is based over an open network. The present security<br>
solutions includes encryption, that is normally undertaken to ensure privacy so that no<br>
person(s) other than the intended recipient can decrypt the information but it does not<br>
guarantee the authenticity of the person who initiates the transaction.<br>
10	"Internet Banking" is a technology advancement that provides a convenient way<br>
of banking at home or from any other place by using a computer. As the word "Internet", the internet banking is over an open network and the security for authentication must be in place to secure the transactions. As all the security solutions were in place, what could be possibly wrong with the current system of security in<br>
15     Internet Banking?<br>
For example, credit card transactions over the internet is a way of online payment and is a part of Internet banking. The credit cards were used in internet, mainly for buying products, services online and for other authentication purposes. The current 20 way of using the credit card is, using providing the credit card number, expire date or Postal Code and other information required for credit card payments. All these information are used to verify the validity of the card and the available balance. But there is no system to check the person using the credit card in online transactions.<br>
25	The identity of the person initiating the credit card transaction is required as the<br>
credit card can be used by providing the Credit Card number and the expire date or any other information required. Even a child can buy products or services online using the credit card by entering the Credit Card number and other required information without the knowledge of the card holder, if this information is known.<br>
30<br>
This can be with or without an intention, but the security lapse is exploited. Due to this, the wrong person may be charged for the transaction and may also result in<br><br>
financial losses. These losses that occur due to failure in authentication, can be suppressed if the invented security solution is implemented.<br>
The security solution can also be implemented in an Automated Teller Machines<br>
5     where the security lapse in authentication, is evident. As per the recent market study, it<br>
A, is observed that a considerable sum of money per day per ATM is lot through these<br>
fraudulent  transactions.   The  reason  being  the  insufficient   security  features  to<br>
authenticate the customer in the ATM, that is, the person starts with the transactions<br>
when he or she inserts the card and the PIN. Even an onlooker can transact with the<br>
10     information.<br>
The security solution can also be used to authenticate the persons refilling the cash in the ATM.<br>
15	A person issuing the cheque must authenticate the cheque when the cheque is<br>
presented for clearance depending upon the permissible limit and the value of the cheque. At present the universal method for this authentication is then confirm from the cheque issuer by telephone and the authentication of the person who confirmed is not guaranteed.<br>
20<br>
Patient history is an essential requirement to treat patients during emergencies like critical illness and accidents. With advent of Technology patient history can be stored online using internet, so that the patient or the doctor has easy access to the information. In this case there security (authentication) should be adequate to ensure<br>
25     that the information does not go in wrong hands.<br>
The invention can also be used to screen blood donors for critical illness and other blood transmitted diseases.<br>
30	The security solution can be extended to provide security at Automated Teller<br>
Machines, Access Control systems, Online Banking, Banking Services, Medical portals, e-business,  networking,  inter-networking,  cellular phone,  data ports,  printer,  fax<br><br>
machine, notebook computers, palm top computers, palm pilot, microfiche devices, scanner, cameras, modems, communication access, personal data systems, pagers, vending machines, PC terminals, information kiosks, point of sales (POS), sharing valuable information with authorized users, wireless transmission, telecommunications,        telephony, SmartCard access controls, remote access networks, debit cards, credit cards, prepaid cards, magnetic cards, phone cards, identifying devices, hotel room key cards, net PC, phone having access to internet, data security, bank locker systems, interbank transactions.<br>
10	The security solution can be used to replace passwords which are hard to<br>
remember, unauthorized persons can gain access to resources if they come to know about the password. The security solution ensures that only the authorized persons are given access to the secured resources.<br>

20     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1, is a flow diagram of the process for online enrollment of "biometrics" data for new users in a web-site. The process explained in the diagram is for storing the "biometrics" data, that will be used for verification during the authentication on a web-<br>
25 site. The enrollment process is standard but may vary depending upon the requirements of the web-site. Jhe "biometrics" data will be stored in the database server for an user identified by the unique identity in the web-site or in the real world. The database server will reside along with the web-site so as to maintain the consistency of the data for other web-sites stored on the same server.<br>
30<br>
The process initiator is the client software component, which is installed and<br><br><br>
used in the step 102. Before the step 102, the user enters the required information to create a temporary/permanent unique identification in the Web-Site as in the step 101. The information required by the web-site are designed and will be implemented in the web-site by the administrator of the web-site and the web-site will call the invention's 5     authentication program for activating the core process of enrollment.<br>
The basic requirement for the invention to select the "biometrics" data;, is the<br>
unique identifier also used during verification/authentication. This unique identifier that<br>
is generated by the web-site or entered by the user will be sent to the invention's<br>
10     authentication module. The authentication module will then redirect the web-browser to<br>
the enrollment page and the step 102 start to process the data given.<br>
The identifier is unique throughout the user database of the invention's database server. The client components introduced in step 102 of this process, will be in form of 15 downloadable components (like ActiveX, Plug-in, Java Applets) that will be compatible with all the available web-browsers, which is the main user-interface for the user. The versioning of the component will be maintained so that the Web-Brpwser will automatically download the latest components.<br>
20	The execution of the step 102 is wholly taken care by the browser and the<br>
deployment of the components is made compatible for the same. In the step 102, all the drivers and other necessary software components will be downloaded to the client PC.<br>
At step 103, the client component will start processing the data. The firstly, it 25     will check for existence of the "Biometrics" scanner. This is done by communicating with the "Biometrics" scanner specified protocol, and the "Biometrics" Scanner drivers supplied by the vendor.<br>
In case the "Biometrics" scanner is not present or connected or if any problem in 30     communicating with the "Biometrics" scanner by the client component, the client component will immediately display the informative message (step 104) related to the cause of the communication problem.<br><br>
The client component will also guide the user with the troubleshooting steps (if any) to rectify the communication problem. In case if the problem persists, the client component will immediately terminate the process by disconnecting itself from the     server component. The server component, is disconnected from the client component will terminate the process at the server and will redirect the web-browser to a web-page, from where the user will be guided.<br>
However if the "Biometrics" scanner is present and connected (step 105), the          client component will activate the scanner. All the communications with scanner is done through the Vendor supplier drivers and support software.<br>
In case of fingerprint security, the user will be directed to place the finger on the scanner and in other cases, the user will be directed to follow the steps provided based      on the type of "biometrics" technology used.<br>
When the "biometrics" data is successfully obtained from the user (step 106), then the client component will identify the unique physical or behavioral characteristics (step 107) and will convert them into a binary data. <br>
The client component will use the standard encryption method and compression (step 108), then the processed data will be sent to the invention's server component at the server.<br>
	The server component will validate the data sent and will store the "biometrics"<br>
data in the database server (step 109).<br>
After step 109, the process is complete the server component will redirect the web-web-browser to the web-page as required by the web-site. <br>
From the steps 103 to 109, the connection between the server and the client component will be open. Any disconnection either by the client component or the server<br><br><br>
component will be taken as the termination of the process and the finalization procedures will be run for the processes in the server and the client. These include clearing of buffers, temporary areas, swap area and other operations as required.<br>
5	The finalization procedure herein mentioned will also be executed during the<br>
successful completion of the process illustrated in FIGURE 1.<br>
Figure 2, is a flow diagram of the process for online enrollment of "biometrics" 10 data for an existing user in a web-site. The process explained in the diagram is for storing the "biometrics" data, that will be used for verification during the authentication on a web-site. The enrollment process is standard but may vary depending upon the requirements of the web-site. The "biometrics" data will be stored in the database server for an user identified by the unique identity in the web-site or in the real world. The 15 database server will reside along with the web-site so as to maintain the consistency of the data for other web-sites stored on the same server.<br>
The process initiator is the client software component, which is installed and used in the step 206. Before the step 206, in the step 201, the user enters the required 20 information and the entered information is validated for the existence of the user in the web-site (step 202). The information required by the web-site are designed and will be implemented in the web-site by the administrator of the web-site and the web-site will call the invention's authentication program for activating the core process of enrollment.<br>
25	The basic requirement for the invention to select the "biometrics" data, is the<br>
unique identifier which is also used during verification/authentication of "biometrics" data. This unique identifier that is generated by the web-site or entered by the user will be sent to the invention's authentication module. The authentication module will then redirect the web-browser to the enrollment page and the steps 206 starts to process the<br>
30     data given.<br>
The identifier is unique throughout the user database of the invention's database<br><br>
server. The client components introduced in step 206 of this process, will be in form of downloadable components (like ActiveX, Plug-in, Java Applets) that will be compatible with all the available web-browsers, which is the main user-interface for the user. The version of the component will be maintained so that the Web-Browser will 5     automatically download the latest components.<br>
The invention's authentication module at the server will check for the existence of any stored "biometrics" information for the user (if any). An informative message will be displayed (step 205) then the process will be terminated. 10<br>
The execution of the step 206 is wholly taken care by the web-browser and the deployment of the components is made compatible for the same. In the step 206, all the drivers and other necessary software components will be downloaded to the client PC.<br>
15	From step 207, the client component will start processing the data. Firstly it will<br>
be the check for existence of the "Biometrics" scanner. This is done by communicating using the "Biometrics" scanner specified protocol using the "Biometrics" Scanner vendor supplied drivers.<br>
20	If the "Biometrics" scanner is not present or connection or if any problem in<br>
communicating with the "Biometrics" scanner by the client component, the client component will immediately display the informative message 208 related to the cause of the communication problem.<br>
25	The client component will also guide the user with the troubleshooting steps (if<br>
any) to rectify the communication problem. If the problem persists, the client component will immediately terminate the process by disconnecting itself from the server component. The server component, is disconnected by the client component will terminate the process at the server and will redirect the web-browser to a web-page,<br>
30     from where the user will be guided.<br>
However if the "Biometrics" scanner is not present, the client component will<br><br><br>
activate the scanner (step 209). All the communications with scanner is done through the Vendor supplier drivers and support software.<br>
In case of fingerprint security, the user will be directed to place the finger on the 5     scanner and in other cases, the user will be directed to follow the steps provided based on the type of "biometrics" technology used.<br>
When the "biometrics" data is successfully obtained from the user (step 210), then the client component will identify the unique physical or behavioral characteristics 10     (step 211) and will convert them into a binary data.<br>
The client component will use the standard encryption method and compression (step 212), then the processed data will be sent to the invention's server component at the server. 15<br>
The server component will validate the data sent and will store the "biometrics" data in the database server (step 213). The server component will store the "biometrics" data based on the unique identifier sent to the server's authentication module by the application at the web-site 20<br>
After step 213, the process is complete, the server component will redirect the web-web-browser to the web-page as required by the web-site.<br>
From the steps 206 to 213 the connection between the server and the client<br>
25     component will be open. Any disconnection either by the client component or the server<br>
component will be taken as the termination of the process and the finalization<br>
procedures will be run for the processes in the server and the client. These include<br>
clearing of buffers, temporary areas, swap area and other operations as required.<br>
30	The finalization procedure herein mentioned will also be executed during the<br>
successful completion of the process illustrated in FIGURE 2.<br><br><br>
Figure 3, is a flow diagram of the process for online enrollment additional "biometrics" data for an existing enrolled user in a web-site. The process explained in 5 the diagram is for storing the "biometrics" data, that will be also used for verification during the authentication on a web-site. In the process of fingerprint verification, this additional fingerprint storage will help in reducing the false rejection during verification and facilitates the user to use any of the enrolled finger during verification.<br>
10	The enrollment is standard process but it may vary depending upon the<br>
requirements of the web-site. The "biometrics" data will be stored in the database server for a user identified by the unique identity in the web-site or in the real world. The database server will reside along with the web-site so as to maintain the consistency of the data for other web-sites stored on the same server.<br>
15<br>
The process initiator is the client software component, which is installed and used in the step 307. Before the step 307, in the step 301, the user enters the required information and the information entered is validated for the existence of the user in the web-site (step 302). The information required by the web-site are designed and will be<br>
20     implemented in the web-site by the administrator of the web-site and the web-site will call the invention's authentication program for activating the core process of enrollment.<br>
The invention's authentication program will check for the existence of stored<br>
"biometrics" data. If no data was stored, then the process will be terminated with an<br>
25     informative message (step 304). This is done mainly to redirect the user to use the<br>
process in illustrated in FIGURE 1. This checking for termination of the process, in case<br>
of the new user is optional.<br>
Upon verification, the unique identifier is selected from the user's database and<br>
30     sent to the server authentication module. The unique identifier is the basic requirement<br>
for   the   invention   to   select   the   "biometrics"   data   and   is   also   used   for<br>
verification/authentication. The authentication module will redirect the web-browser to<br><br><br>
the enrollment page from where the step 307 starts processing.<br>
The identifier is unique throughout the user database of the invention's database server. The client components introduced in step 307 of this process, will be in form of downloadable components (like ActiveX, Plug-in, Java Applets) that will be compatible with all the available web-browsers, which is the main user-interface for the user. The versioning of the component will be maintained so that the Web-Browser will automatically download the latest components.<br>
The execution of the step 307 is wholly taken care by the web-browser and the deployment of the components is made compatible for the same.for the step..307,.all the drivers and other necessary software components will be downloaded to the client PC,<br>
From step 308, the client component will start processing the data. Firstly.it will be the check for existence of the "Biometrics" scanner (step 308). This is done by communicating using the the "Biometrics" scanner specified protocol using the "Biometrics" Scanner vendor supplied drivers.<br>
If the "Biometrics" scanner was not present or connection or if any problem in communicating with the "Biometrics" scanner by the client component, the client component will immediately display an informative message 309 related to the cause of the communication problem.<br>
The client component will also guide the user with the troubleshooting steps (if any) to rectify the communication problem. In case if the problem persists, the client component will immediately terminate the process by disconnecting itself from the server component. When the server component, is disconnected from the client component it will terminate the process at the server and will redirect the web-browser to a web-page, from where the user will be guided.<br>
However, if the "Biometrics" scanner was present 310, the client component will activate the scanner. All the communications with scanner is done through the Vendor<br><br>
supplier drivers and support software.<br>
In case of fingerprint security, the user will be directed to place the finger on the scanner and another cases, the user will be directed to follow the steps provided based 5     on the type of "biometrics" technology used.<br>
When the "biometrics" data is successfully obtained from the user in the step 311, then the client component will identify the unique physical or behavioral characteristics (step 312) and will convert them into a binary data.<br>
10<br>
The client component will use the standard encryption method and compression (step 313), then the processed data will be sent to the invention's server component at the server.<br>
15	The server component will validate the data sent and will compare the sent<br>
"biometrics" data with the one stored in the database. The identification of the "biometrics" data in the database is done based on the unique identifier sent initially. If the comparison was not successful the process will be terminated with an informative message.<br>
20<br>
If the comparison was successful, the process of enrolling the additional "biometrics" information starts.   The process includes activating the scanner (step 315), retrieving the "biometrics" data from the scanner (step 316),   creating data from the characteristics (step 317), encrypting and compressing (step 318). 25<br>
After the (step 318), the data is sent to the server. The server will validate the data sent and will store the "biometrics" data sent as additional "biometrics" data that will be used during verification.<br>
30	From the steps 307 to 319 the connection between the server and the client<br>
component will be open. Any disconnection either by the client component or the server component will be taken as the termination of the process and the finalization<br><br><br>
procedures will be run for the processes in the server and the client. These include clearing of buffers, temporary areas, swap area and other operations as required.<br>
The finalization procedure herein mentioned will also be executed during the 5     successful completion of the process illustrated in FIGURE 3.<br>

Upon verification, the unique identifier is selected from the user's database and<br>
sent to the server authentication module. The unique identifier is the basic requirement<br>
for   the   invention   to   select   the   "biometrics"   data   and   is   also   used   for<br>
30     verification/authentication. The authentication module will redirect the web-browser to<br>
the enrollment page from where the step 404 processing starts.<br><br>

The client component will use the standard encryption method and compression (step 410), then the processed data will be sent to the invention's server component at the server.<br>
The server component will validate the data sent and will compare the sent "biometrics" data with the one stored in the database (step 411). The identification of the "biometrics" data in the database is done based on the unique identifier sent initially. If the comparison was not successful the process will be terminated with an informative message (step 412). The error status will be returned to the application in the web-site for further actions.<br>
If the comparison was successful, the success status will be returned to the application in the web-site for further actions.

data with the one stored in the database (step 811). The identification of the "biometrics" data in the database is done based on the unique identifier sent initially. If the comparison was not successful the process will be terminated with an informative message (step 712). The error status will be returned to the application that called the invention's authentication program.<br>
If the comparison was successful, the success status will be returned to the application that called the invention's authentication program for further actions. From the steps 805 to 811 the connection between the server and the client component will be open. Any disconnection either by the client component or the server component will be taken as the termination of the process and the finalization procedures will be run for the processes in the server and the client. These include clearing of buffers, temporary areas, swap area and other operations as required.<br>
The finalization procedure herein mentioned will also be executed during the successful completion of the process illustrated in FIGURE 8.<br>
Figure 9, is a flow diagram of the process for online authentication using biometrics and using invention's authentication server. The invention's authentication server will be connected to the Internet and the web-site (herein called as "Third-party Web-Site") intended to implement the invention's authentication process will link their authentication process to the invention's authentication server. The connectivity between the Third-party Web-site and the invention's authentication server may be through the open network like Internet or Local Area network also called as LAN.<br>
For this process, the "biometrics" data of the users must be enrolled using the process illustrated in Figure 1 and 3 using the unique identifier generated and sent by the application at the third-party web-site.<br>
This process is only the authentication process that validates the user and the actual application is not illustrated here and it is executed on the third-party web-site. The  application  in the  third-party web-site  may  be  linked  to  the  invention's<br><br>
authentication based on the requirement.<br>
The basic requirement for this authentication process, is the unique identifier that is generated or entered by the user and the "biometrics" data will be stored based on identifier, so that during verification the "biometrics" data is also selected using the identifier.<br>
In this process, in the step 901, user enters the identification information in the third-party web-site as required.<br>
The entered information will be validated and if the entered information is not valid, the process will be terminated immediately by displaying the message. This process of validating the information entered is implemented only by the third-party web-site<br>
The authentication process by the invention's program starts from the step 802, after the identification details is provided by the user is valid. The invention's authentication program at the server, is activated by providing the unique identifier that will be used for verification. The application in the third-party web-site will be linked to the authentication server by redirecting the web-browser to the authentication page on the authentication server.<br>
The process initiator for the invention's authentication program is the client software component, which is installed and used in the step 904.<br>
The invention's authentication program will check for the existence of stored "biometrics" data (step 902). If no data was stored for the unique identifier, then the process will be terminated with an informative message (step 903).<br>
The client components introduced in step 904 of this process, will be in form of downloadable components that is automatically downloaded to the client computer if the component does not exists or if outdated. In the step 904, all the drivers and other<br><br>
necessary software components will be downloaded to the client PC.<br>
From step 805 the client component will start processing. The first will be the checking for existence of the "Biometrics" scanner (step 905). This is done by communicating using the the "Biometrics" scanner specified protocol using the "Biometrics" Scanner vendor supplied drivers.<br>
If the "Biometrics" scanner was not present or connection or if any problem in communicating with the "Biometrics" scanner by the client component, the client component will immediately display an informative message 906 related to the cause of the communication problem.<br>
The client component will also guide the user with the troubleshooting steps (if any) to rectify the communication problem. In case if the problem persists, the client component will immediately terminate the process by disconnecting itself from the server component. The server component, upon disconnection by the client component will terminate the process at the server and will redirect the web-browser to a web-page, from where the user will be guided.<br>
If the "Biometrics" scanner was present, the client component will activate the scanner (step 907). All the communications with scanner is done through the Vendor supplier drivers and support software.<br>
In case of fingerprint security, the user will be directed to place the finger on the scanner and in other cases, the user will be directed to follow the steps provided based on the type of "biometrics" technology used.<br>
When the "biometrics" data is successfully obtained from the user in the step 908, then the client component will identify the unique physical or behavioral characteristics (step 909) and will convert them into a binary data.<br>
The client component will use the standard encryption method and compression<br><br>
(step 910), then the processed data will be sent to the invention's server component at the server.<br>
The server component will validate the data sent and will compare the sent "biometrics" data with the one stored in the database (step 911). The identification of the "biometrics" data in the database is done based on the unique identifier sent initially. If the comparison was not successful the process will be terminated with an informative message (step 912). The error status will be returned to the application that called the invention's authentication program.<br>
If the comparison was successful, the success status will be returned to the application that called the invention's authentication program for further actions. From the steps 905 to 911 the connection between the server and the client component will be open. Any disconnection either by the client component or the server component will be taken as the termination of the process and the finalization procedures will be run for the processes in the server and the client. These include clearing of buffers, temporary areas, swap area and other operations as required.<br>
The finalization procedure herein mentioned will also be executed during the successful completion of the process illustrated in FIGURE 9.<br>
Figure 10, is a flow diagram of the process for online authentication using biometrics in an internet banking transaction.<br>
For this process, the "biometrics" data of the users must be enrolled using the process illustrated in Figure 1 and 3 based on the bank's unique identifier provided to their customer.<br>
The web-site herein called, is the bank's web-site that facilitates its customer to do banking transaction online, also called as internet banking.<br>
This process is only the authentication process that validates the user and the<br><br>
actual internet banking application is not illustrated here. This process may occur before or after the internet banking process, based on the application design.<br>
The basic requirement for this authentication process, is the unique identifier that is generated or entered by the user. In the case, the user enters, the User Name/ID for example, that may be used as identifier and the "biometrics" data will be stored based on identifier, so that during verification the "biometrics" data is also selected using the identifier.<br>
In this process, in the step 1001, user enters the identification details as required by the web-site.<br>
The entered information will be validated by the web-site and if the entered information is not valid, the process will be terminated immediately by displaying the message. This process is implemented by the web-site and the invention's role does not interfere yet.<br>
The authentication process by the invention's program starts from the step 1002, after the identification details provided by the user is valid. The invention's authentication program at the server, is activated by providing the unique identifier that will be used for verification.<br>
The process initiator for the invention's authentication program is the client software component which is installed and used in the step 1004.<br>
The invention's authentication program will check for the existence of stored "biometrics" data (step 1002). If no data was stored for the unique identifier, then the process will be terminated with an informative message (step 1003).<br>
The client components introduced in step 1004 of this process, will be in form of downloadable components (like ActiveX, Plug-in, Java Applets) that will be compatible with all the available web-browsers which is the main user-interface for the user. The<br><br>
versioning of the component will be maintained so that the Web-Browser will automatically download the latest components.<br>
The execution of the step 1004 is wholly taken care by the web-browser and the deployment of the components is made compatible for the same. In the step 1004, all the drivers and other necessary software components will be downloaded to the client PC.<br>
From step 1005, the client component will start processing. The first will be the checking for existence of the "Biometrics" scanner (step 1005). This is done by communicating using the "Biometrics" scanner specified protocol using the "Biometrics" Scanner vendor supplied drivers.<br>
If the "Biometrics" scanner was not present or connection or if any problem in communicating with the "Biometrics" scanner by the client component, the client component will immediately display an informative message 1006 related to the cause of the communication problem.<br>
The client component will also guide the user with the troubleshooting steps (if any) to rectify the communication problem. In case if the problem persists, the client component will immediately terminate the process by disconnecting itself from the server component. The server component, upon disconnection by the client component will terminate the process at the server and will redirect the web-browser to a web-page, from where the user will be guided.<br>
If the "Biometrics" scanner was present, the client component will activate the scanner (step 1007). All the communications with scanner is done through the Vendor supplier drivers and support software.<br>
In case of fingerprint security, the user will be directed to place the finger on the scanner and in other cases, the user will be directed to follow the steps provided based on the type of "biometrics" technology used.<br><br>
When the "biometrics" data is successfully obtained from the user in the step 1008, then the client component will identify the unique physical or behavioral characteristics (step 1009) and will convert them into a binary data.<br>
The client component will use the standard encryption method and compression (step 1010), then the processed data will be sent to the invention's server component at the server.<br>
The server component will validate the data sent and will compare the sent "biometrics" data with the one stored in the database (step 1011). The identification of the "biometrics" data in the database is done based on the unique identifier sent initially. If the comparison was not successful the process will be terminated with an informative message (step 1012). The error status will be returned to the application in the web-site for further actions.<br>
If the comparison was successful, the success status will be returned to the application in the web-site for further actions. From the steps 1005 to 1011 the connection between the server and the client component will be open. Any disconnection either by the client component or the server component will be taken as the termination of the process and the finalization procedures will be run for the processes in the server and the client. These include clearing of buffers, temporary areas, swap area and other operations as required.<br>
The finalization procedure herein mentioned will also be executed during the successful completion of the process illustrated in FIGURE 10.<br>
Figure 11, is a flow diagram of the process for online authentication in software applications.<br>
For this process, the "biometrics" data of the users must be enrolled using the process illustrated in Figure 1 and 3 based on the unique identifier used for identifying<br><br>
users in the application.<br>
This process is only the authentication process that validates the user and the actual application is not illustrated here. This process may occur before or after the existing authentication process, based on the application design.<br>
The basic requirement for this authentication process, is the unique identifier that is generated or entered by the user. In the case, the user enters, the User Name/ID for example, that may be used as identifier and the "biometrics" data will be stored based on identifier, so that during verification the "biometrics" data is also selected using the identifier.<br>
In this process, in the step 1101, user enters the identification details as required by the application.<br>
The entered information will be validated by the application and if the entered information is not valid, the process will be terminated immediately by displaying the message. This process is implemented by the application and the invention's role does not interfere yet.<br>
The authentication process by the invention's program starts from the step 1102, after the identification details provided by the user is valid. The invention's authentication program at the server is activated by providing the unique identifier that will be used for verification.<br>
