				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a clamp paint lack for movable/swing nose crossing provided with -full head/pointed head nose thickness -for turnouts on Indian Rai1 ways.<br>
At.   the  stations  trains  pass  along   the straight line o-f the turnout and stopping  ones take the branch line/loop line of it be-fore coming to a halt. The speed  o-f the pas-sing train i» not restricted  taut  that of the stopping train  is restricted to 15 km/hour.  The conventional  type  -fixed crossing has a  draw  hack  o-f intense impact caused by  passing of wheels over the gap between  wing/brace   rail  and  a  nose  rail  and  by striking  the guard rail.  ihe impact is- intensified  as the  train speed increasiest,.  On the other hand over  the gap in the ordinary  crossing the wheel  transition  is not. smooth.  Therefore, the railway engineers around the world decided to remove the gap in the crossing portion. This  heia resulted  in the use o-f especially   designed movable  cross-ing  alsso  called as swing nose  cros-aing. To lock  the awing nose crossing a clamp point  lack.  i» required  -for direct  locking the   swing/movable  nose and the brace  rail at their nose itself.<br><br>
The clamp point lock known in the art. comprises a locking base -fixed to the sleeper under movable nose. The swing nose trough is mounted on the locking base. Locking crank having locking heads on both the ends thereof is pivotally secured at the centre of the bracket -fixed to the swing nose. A drive rod is connected to the point machine having 260 mm stroke as well as the locking crank -for providing pulling and pushing action o-f swing nose to lock the locking head in the locking piece provided in the locking base so as to lock the swing nose on the right hand aide or an the left. hand side with the locking base. There are disadvantages associated with the locking device. One of the main disadvantage is that this clamp point lock is fitted on pre~stres»t»d concrete 'sleeper under nose which is to be lowered and cause undesirable different level of sleepers in the vicinity of nosse. Another disadvantage is that the cutting of wooden sleeper i« not desirable when ciaoup lock is fitted on wooden sleeper.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the locking activity is not always positive as there is no arrangement provided to arrest creep.<br><br>
There-fore the main object of this invention is to propose a clamp point lock to be -fitted directly on the rails between sleepers,.<br>
Another obiect of this invention is to propose a clamp point lock to lock the movable portion of the swing nose directly with its brace rail.<br>
Another' obiect of this invention is to propose a clamp point, lock to take care of creep upto + 10 mm.<br>
Vet another obiect of this invention is to propose a clamp point, lock which takes care of gauge wjdeni ng.<br>
Still another obiect of this invention is to propose a cla/np point, lock which maintain locking and detection even at high speed and under heavy loads.<br>
Further object. of this invention is to propose a clamp point, lock with accentric bushes for adjustment. of lock arm with brace rail bracket.<br>
Further another obiect of this invention is to propose a clamp point lock with accetal bu»he« on wear prone areas.<br>
Further additional obiect of this invention iB to propose to be operated with a point machine having 220/2613 mm stroke.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided a clamp point lock comprising a locking arm adapted to be secured with the swing nose at. the bottom surface and on either sides thereof pivotally, such that to be operated by a clamp lock slide secured with the said swing nose, an operating extended profile being provided with said clamp lock slide on either aides thereof such that to provide movement to said lack arm to be locked with the brace rail locking brackets, a spring being provided with said brace rail bracket to give un--locking movement, to said lock arm thereof upon actuation of the same by said clamp lock slide.<br>
In accordance with this?, invention a clamp point lock has a clamp lock slide secured at the lower surface of the swing nose/point rail with the help of « swing nose bracket adapted to be secured with said awing nose. Locking arms are secured pivotally with the lower surface of the swing nose on either sides such that to be displaced by the clamp lock slide. An operating extended profiles are provided with the clamp lock slide on both the sides thereof fot operating the locking arms, A locking bracket is?, provided with brace rails on either sides for locking the said lock arm<br><br>
therewith. A spring is provided with the brace rail bracket, to unlock the lacking arm when the swing noae is required to be moved in the right hand side or left hand side? ass desired by the operator. Lock armst are provided with eccentric bushes -for their adjustment with brace rail bracket. Lack arms also provided with accetal bushes.<br>
A clamp point lock according to a. preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings- wherein: -<br>
Fig.1       shows the plan view o-f the clamp point  lock known in the  art,<br>
Fig.2. shows the front. view ci-f the clamp point lock •for swing nose proposed by the present i nvention«<br>
Fig.3      shows the plan view of the clamp lock,<br>
Fig.4      shows  the  plan view  of  the  swing  ncisse cross-ing fitted with  clamp point lock.<br>
Referring to the drawings chown in Fiig. 1 the conventional known clamp point lock for swing/movable nose crossing has three; armed locking crank A pivotalIy secured at. the web of the swing nose B by means of swing nose bracket. C. The middle arm of locking crank A connected to the point machine by means of driving rod<br><br>
L provided to operate the swing nose to the right hand side or to the left, hand side in the swing nose trough or -frog H which is secured on the? locking base H. The .locking head D of left arm o-f locking crank A ha® been provided -for locking o-f swing nose/point rail B on left hand side with the locking piece E secured on locking base H and locking head F of right arm provided to lock the awing nose/point, rail B on right hand side with locking piece 6 secured on locking base H.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly figs 28(3 the clamp point lock for swing nose or point rail crossings has a lock arm i pivotally secured with the lower surface of the swing nose/point rail 2. The lock arm 1 is provided on left, hand side as well as on right hand side of the swing nose 2 for locking the swing nose either with the left hand brace rail 3 or with the right hand brace; rail 3 having the brace? rail bracket 4 secured therewith for locking the lock arms 1 therewith. A spring 12 is being provided with the brace rail bracket 4 for un-locking of lock arm 1. A clamp lock slide is secured with the swing nose 2 by means of a swing nose brackets 6 for providing movement to the swing nose 2 upon actuation of the clamp lock slide 5 in<br><br>
