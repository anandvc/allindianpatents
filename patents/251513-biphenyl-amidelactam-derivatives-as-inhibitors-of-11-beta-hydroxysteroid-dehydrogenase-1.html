BIPHENYL AMIDE LACTAM DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITORS OF 11-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE 1<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/745,3 II, filed April 21, 2006.<br>
5	This invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of 11 -B-hydroxysteroid<br>
dehydrogenase type 1 ("11-β-HSD1"), and to pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and the uses of these compounds and compositions in the treatment of the human or animal body, and to novel intermediates useful in preparation of the inhibitors. The present compounds show potent and selective inhibition of 11-B-HSD1, and as such arc useful in<br>
10      the treatment of disorders responsive to the modulation of 1 1-p-HSDl, such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cognitive disorders, and the like.<br>
Glucocorticoids acting in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, arc important regulators of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism. Chronic glucocorticoid excess is associated with insulin resistance, visceral obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, which<br>
!5      also represent the classical hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. 11-P-HSD1 catalyses the conversion of inactive cortisone to active Cortisol, and has been implicated in the development of metabolic syndrome. Evidence in rodents and humans links 11-B-HSDl to metabolic syndrome. Evidence suggests that a drug which specifically inhibits 11-β-HSD1 in type 2 diabetic patients will lower blood glucose by reducing hepatic<br>
20      gluconeogenesis, reduce central obesity, improve atherogenic lipoprotein phenotypes. iower blood pressure, and reduce insulin resistance. Insulin effects in muscle will be enhanced, and insulin secretion from die beta cells of the islet may also be increased. Evidence from animal and human studies also indicates that an excess of glucocorticoids impair cognitive function. Recent results indicate that inactivation of 11-P-HSDt<br>
25      enhances memory function in both men and mice. The 11-p-HSD inhibitor carbcnoxolonc was shown to improve cognitive function in healthy elderly men and type 2 diabetics, and inactivation of the 11-P-HSD1 gene prevented aging-induced impairment in mice. Selective inhibition of II-P-HSD1 with a pharmaceutical agent has recently been shown to improve memory retention in mice.<br>
30	A number of publications have appeared in recent years reporting agents that<br>
inhibit 11-p-HSDl. Sec International Application WO2004/056744 which discloses<br><br>
WO 2007/124337<br><br>
PCT/US2007/066921<br><br>
adamantyl acetamidcs as inhibitors of 11-P-HSD, international Application WO2005/108360 which discloses pyrrol id in-2-one and piperidin-2-one derivatives as inhibitors of 11-p-HSD. and International Application WO2005/108361 which discloses adamantyl pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives as inhibitors of I I-β-HSD. In spite of the number 5      of treatments for diseases that involve 11-P-HSD I. the current therapies suffer from one or more inadequacies, including poor or incomplete efficacy, unacceptable side effects, and contraindications for certain patient populations. Thus, there remains a need for an improved treatment using alternative or improved pharmaceutical agents that inhibit 11-β-HSD1 and treat the diseases that could benefit from 11 -P-HSD ] inhibition. The present<br>
10     invention provides such a contribution to the art based on the finding that a novel class of compounds has a potent and selective inhibitory activity on 11-P-HSDl. The present Invention is distinct in the particular structures and their activities. There is a continuing need for new methods of treaiing diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive disorders. and it is an object of this invention to meet these and other needs.<br>

 <br>
hypertension, and alterations in lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein metabolism. Type 2 diabetics are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications, e.g., atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose 5      homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are important in the management and treatment of diabetes mellitus. Many patients who have insulin resistance but have not developed type 2 diabetes are also at risk of developing "Syndrome X" or "Metabolic syndrome". Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance along with abdominal obesity, hyperinsulinemia, high blood pressure,<br>
10      low HDL. high VLDL, hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and chronic renal failure. These patients are at increased risk of developing the cardiovascular complications listed above whether or not they develop overt diabetes mellitus.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may have one or more chiral centers and may exist in a variety of stereoisomer^ configurations. As a consequence of these chiral centers the compounds of the present invention can occur as racematcs, as individual enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers, as wel! as diastereomers and mixtures of 15      diastereomers. All such racemales, enantiomers, diastereomers and mixtures are within the scope of the present invention, whether pure, partially purified, orunpurified mixtures. For the examples provided herein, when a molecule which contains a chiral center or centers of known configuration is presented, its stereochemistry is designated in the name and in the structural representation of the molecule. If the stereochemistry is 20      unknown or undefined its stereochemistry is not designated in the name or in the structural representation of the molecule. Embodiments of the invention include the Examples provided herein, and although the Example provided may be of one chiral or conformational form, or a salt thereof, further embodiments of the invention include all other steroisomeric and or conformational forms of the examples described, as well as 25      pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts thereof.

may exist in different tautomeric forms and it is intended that any tautomeric forms which the compounds are able to form are included within the scope of the present invention. The term "enantiomeric enrichment" as used herein refers to the increase in the amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing 5      the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or "ec", which is found using the following equation:<br>
ee = E1' - E2 X 100 E1'+E2 wherein E1 is the amount of the first enantiomer and E2 is the amount of the second<br>
10      enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is present in a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final ratio of 70:30 is achieved, the cc with respect to the first enantiomer is 40%. However, if the final ratio is 90:10, the cc with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An cc of greater than 90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of greater<br>
15      than 99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the an using standard techniques and procedures, such as gas or high performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of the appropriate chiral column, clucnt and conditions necessary to effect separation of the enantiomeric pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the<br>
20      .specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of formula J can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and processes, such as those disclosed by J. Jacques, et al., "Enantiomers. Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981, and E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen," Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", (Wiley-lnterscience 1994), and European Patent Application No. EP-A-<br>
25      838448, published April 29, 1998. Examples of resolutions include recrysiallization techniques or chiral chromatography.<br>
The compounds of Formula I, can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art following a variety of procedures, some of which arc illustrated in the procedures and schemes set forth below. The particular order of steps required 10 produce the<br>
30      compounds of Formula 1 is dependent upon the particular compound to being<br>
synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties. The reagents or starting materials are readily available to one of skill in the art, and to the<br><br>
WO 2007/124337<br><br>
PCT/US2007/066921<br><br>
extent not commercially available, are readily synthesized by one of ordinary skill in the art following standard procedures commonly employed in the art, along with the various procedures and schemes set forth below.<br>

Those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications may be made while not departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. All publications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the level of those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
10	The optimal time for performing the reactions of the Schemes, Preparations,<br>
Examples and Procedures can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction via conventional chromatographic techniques. Furthermore, it is preferred to conduct the reactions of the invention under an incn atmosphere, such as. for example, argon, nitrogen. Choice of solvent is generally not critical so long as the solvent employed is<br>
15      inert to the ongoing reaction and sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to effect the desired reaction. The compounds are preferably isolated and purified before their use in subsequent reactions. Some compounds may crystallize out of the reaction solution during their formation and then collected by filtration, or the reaction solvent may be removed by extraction, evaporation, or decantation. The intermediates and final products<br>
20     of Formula I may be further purified, if desired by common techniques such as<br>
recrystallization or chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all substituents are compatible with all reaction conditions. These compounds may be protected or modified at a convenient point in the synthesis by methods well known in the art.<br>

Twenty microliters of each are then transferred to a column of a 96-well polypropylene Nunc plate where they are further diluted 50-fold followed by subsequent two-fold titration, ten times across the plate with additional DMSO using a Tecan Genesis 200 automated system. Plates are then transferred to a Tecan Freedom 200 system with 5      an attached Tecan Temo 96-well head and an Ultra 384 plate reader. Reagents are<br>
supplied in 96-well polypropylene Nunc plates and are dispensed individually into black 96-well Molecular Devices High Efficiency assay plates (40 µL/ well capacity) in the following fashion: 9 µLwell of substrate (2.22 mM NADP, 55.5 µM Cortisol, 10 mM Tris, 0.25% Prionex, 0.1% Triton X100), 3 fiL/well of water to compound wells or 3µL<br>
10     to control and standard wells, 6µL/well recombinant human 1 Iβ-HSD type 1 enzyme, 2 µL/well of compound dilutions.  For ultimate calculation of percent inhibition, a series of wells are added that represent assay minimum and maximum: one set containing substrate with 667 MM carbenoxoione (background), and another set containing substrate and enzyme without compound (maximum signal). Final DMSO concentration is 0.5% for all<br>
15      compounds controls and standards. Plates are then placed on a shaker by the robotic arm of the Tecan for 15 seconds before being covered and stacked for a three hour incubation period at room temperature. Upon completion of this incubation, the Tecan robotic arm removes each plate individually from the stacker and places them in position for addition of 5 µL/well of a 250 µM carbenoxoione solution to stop the enzymatic reaction. Plates<br>
20     are then shaken once more for 15 seconds then placed into an Ultra 384 microplate reader (355EX/460EM) for detection of NADPH fluorescence.<br>

Human aortic smooth muscle cell assay<br>
Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) are cultured in 5% FBS growth medium to a passage number of 6, then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended at a density of9x10" cel!s/mL in 0.5% FBS assay medium containing 12 5      ng/mL hTNFa to induce expression of 1 lp-HSDI. Cells are seeded into 96-wcIl tissue culture assay plates at 100 uX/well (9xl03cells/well) and incubated for 48 hours ai 37'C, 5% C02- Following induction, cells are incubated for 4 hours at 37"c, 5% CO2 in assay medium containing test compounds then treated with 10 uLAvell 0f 10 u.M cortisone solubilized in assay medium, and incubated for 16 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2. Medium from<br>
10      each well is transferred to a plate for subsequent analysis of Cortisol using a competitive fluorescence resonance time resolved immunoassay. In solution, an allophycocyanin (APC)-cortisoi conjugate and free Cortisol analytc compete for binding to a mouse anti-cortisol antibody/Europium (£u)-anti mouse lgG complex, Higher levels of free Cortisol result in dimmv?.hwig energy \ranrfer from \he Europium-lgG to the APC control complex<br>
15      resulting in less APC fluorescence. Fluorescent intensities for Europium and APC are measured using a LJL Analyst AD. Europium and APC excitation is measured using 360 nm excitation and 615 nm and 650 nm emission filters respectively. Time resolved parameters for Europuium were 1000 us integration time \vith a 200 us delay. APC parameters are set at 150 us integration time with a 50 us delay. Fluorescent intensities<br>
20      measured for APC are modified by dividing by the Eu fluorescence (APC/Eu). This ratio is then used to determine the unknown Cortisol concentration by interpolation using a Cortisol standard curve fitted with a 4-parameter logistic equation. These concentrations arc then used to determine compound activity by plotting concentration versus % inhibition, fitting with a 4-parameter curve and reporting the IC50.<br>
