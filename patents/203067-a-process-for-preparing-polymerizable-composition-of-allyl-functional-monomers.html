A PROCESS FOR PREPARING POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITION OF ALLYL FUNCTIONAL MONOMERS<br>
PPG INDUSTRIES OHIO,  INC.  of 3800 WEST 143RD STREET, CLEVELAND, OH 44111, U.S.A. a AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
5	DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerizable composition comprising first and second allyl functional monomers.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a polymerizable composition of a first allyl functional<br>
10  monomer having at least two allyl groups that is selected such that a polymerizate of the first monomer has a 15 second Barcol 934 hardness of at least 40, and a second allyl functional monomer selected from polyether diol bis(allyl carbonate), polylactone diol bis(allyl carbonate) and mixtures<br>
15  thereof. The present invention also relates to polymerizates prepared from such polymerizable compositions, and photochromic articles prepared from such polymerizates.<br>
Polymerizable organic compositions based on allyl functional monomers, such as polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers,<br>
20  e.g., ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), and poly(allyl<br>
ester) monomers, e.g., diallyl isophthalate, and polymerizates obtained therefrom are well known in the art.  Polymerizates of allyl functional monomers, such as polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers, possess excellent clarity, hardness and good<br>
25  flexibility, examples of which include, ophthalmic lenses, sunglasses, and automotive and aircraft transparencies.<br>
Recently, photochromic plastic materials, particularly plastic materials for optical applications, have been the subject of considerable attention.  In particular,<br>
3 0  photochromic ophthalmic plastic lenses have been investigated<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
in part due to the weight advantage that they can offer relative to ophthalmic lenses made of inorganic glass.  In addition, photochromic transparencies for vehicles, such as automobiles and airplanes, have been of interest because of 5  the weight reduction and potential safety features that such transparencies offer.  Photochromism is a phenomenon involving a change in color of a photochromic substance, or an article containing such a substance, upon exposure to light radiation containing ultraviolet rays, and a reversion to the original<br>
10  color when the influence of the ultraviolet radiation is discontinued.  Examples of light sources that contain ultraviolet rays include sunlight and the light of a mercury lamp.  Discontinuation of the ultraviolet radiation can be achieved, for example, by storing the photochromic substance<br>
15  or article in the dark, by removing the source of ultraviolet radiation or by filtering out the ultraviolet rays from the light source.<br>
Fully cured polymerizates of many allyl functional monomers, e.g., polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers such as<br>
20  ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), are not particularly well suited to the incorporation of organic photochromic substances by diffusion, e.g., by thermal transfer.  In some instances, for example in the case of ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), one or more organic photochromic<br>
25  substances may be incorporated by diffusion into an undercured polymerizate, followed by an additional curing step to fully cure the polymerizate having organic photochromic substances incorporated therein.  Such two-stage cure processes require extra time and expense, and can result in inconsistent and<br>
30 unreliable incorporation of organic photochromic substances into the polymerizate.<br>
It would be desirable to develop polymerizable compositions of allyl functional monomers that can be used to<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCTYUS01/10081<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
prepare substantially completely cured polymerizates into which organic photochromic substances may be incorporated.  In addition, it would desirable that polymerizates prepared from such newly developed compositions have good physical<br>
5  properties, such as hardness and heat distortion temperature, and that photochromic articles prepared from such polymerizates have good photochromic properties, e.g., as measured by change in optical density (as described in further detail in the examples herein).<br>
0	United States Patent No. 4,742,133 describes the<br>
preparation of a poly(allyl carbonate) functional prepolymers by contacting a liquid monomer composition comprising at least one poly(allyl carbonate) functional monomer with oxygen.  The poly(allyl carbonate) functional monomers of the '133 patent<br>
5  are described as including those based on polyhydroxy<br>
functional chain extended compounds, such as ethylene oxide extended glycerol and compounds based on lactone extension.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,666,976 describes a polymerizable solution comprising polyol(allyl carbonate)<br>
0  monomer, liquid polyol(allyl carbonate) polymer or a mixture thereof, and bromoxylenol blue.  The polyols of the polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer and liquid polyol(allyl carbonate) polymer are described in the '976 patent as . including polyol-functional chain extended compounds, e.g.,<br>
5  ethylene oxide extended glycerol, and compounds based on lactone extension.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,973,0 93 describes polymerizable organic compositions of a first monomer component which is a polyol(allyl carbonate), and from about 2<br>
0  to 35 weight percent of a second monomer component which is an alkoxylated bisphenol having acrylate or methacrylate functionality.  Substantially completely cured polymerizates prepared from the polymerizable compositions of the '093<br><br>

the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about."<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
5	Substantially completely cured polymerizates of the<br>
polymerizable composition of the present invention have improved organic photochromic substance incorporation, relative to substantially completely cured polymerizates prepared from the first allyl functional monomer alone in the<br>
10  absence of the second allyl functional monomer.  As used<br>
herein and in the claims the term "substantially completely cured polymerizate" means a polymerizate that has been cured to an extent such that additional exposure to cure conditions, e.g., thermal cure, will not result in a substantial<br>
15  improvement in physical properties, e.g., hardness and heat distortion temperature, (i.e., a polymerizate that is not under- or partially cured).<br>
Organic photochromic substances may be incorporated into the polymerizates of the present invention by methods<br>
2 0  that are well known to the skilled artisan.  Typically,<br>
organic photochromic substances are incorporated into the polymerizate by means of a process of diffusion or imbibition, which involves applying a solution of the organic photochromic substance to least a portion of the polymerizate followed by<br>
25  heating for a given amount of time, e.g., 135°C for 5 hours. While in contact with the applied organic photochromic solution, photochromic substance diffuses into and is retained within the polymerizate. Upon completion of the heating step, excess photochromic solution is rinsed off of the surfaces of<br>
30  the polymerizate.<br>
To determine that polymerizates according to the present invention have improved photochromic substance incorporation, Net Absorbance at a wavelength of 390<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
nanometers (nm) is calculated.  The determination of Net Absorbance involves measuring the absorbance (at 3 90 nm) of the polymerizate prior to imbibition of photochromic substance, and subtracting this value from the measured 5  absorbance (at 3 90 nm) of the photochromic imbibed<br>
polymerizate while in the bleached state.  The term "bleached state" refers to the photochromic imbibed polymerizate being in a non-activated or non-colored state.  Absorbance measurements are taken at room temperature from polymerizates<br>
10  of equivalent thickness using a spectrophotometer, e.g., a<br>
Varian Model Cary 3 spectrophotometer.  A Net Absorbance value of zero would indicate that no photochromic substance had been incorporated into the polymerizate.  While Net Absorbance values can vary with the type and combinations of organic<br>
15 photochromic substances that are incorporated into the<br>
polymerizate, Net Absorbance values of at least 0.3, e.g., at least 1.0, are considered generally to be acceptable.<br>
As used herein and in the claims, the term "allyl" and related terms (e.g., "allyl functional monomer" and "allyl<br>
20  group") refers to unsubstituted and substituted allyl groups represented by the following general formula I,<br>
I H2C=C(R5)-CH,-wherein R5 is hydrogen, halogen (e.g., chlorine or bromine) or<br>
25  a Cj-C, alkyl group (e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl).  Most commonly, R5 is hydrogen and the allyl group represented by general formula I is an unsubstituted allyl group, H3C=CH-CH2-.<br>
The first allyl functional monomer of the<br>
30  composition of the present invention has at least two allyl<br>
groups, e.g., from 2 to 6 allyl groups.  Preferably, the first allyl functional monomer has 2 allyl groups.  More particularly, the allyl groups of the first allyl functional<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
monomer are selected from allyl carbonate groups, allyl ester groups and combinations thereof.  The first allyl functional monomer or mixture of first allyl functional monomers is selected such that a substantially completely cured B  polymerizate thereof has a 15 second Barcol 934 hardness of at least 40, e.g., from 40 to 70.  Typically, the 15 second Barcol 934 hardness of a substantially completely cured polymerizate prepared from the first allyl functional monomer or mixture of first allyl functional monomers is from 43 to 10  60.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the first allyl functional monomer (a) is selected from,<br>
(a)(i) an allyl functional monomer represented by<br>
the following general formula II,<br>
15	II<br>

CH=CH-, -C(CH3)2-, -C(CHj) (C6HS) - and	° , and R3 is an<br>
allyl group (e.g., a substituted or unsubstituted allyl group as described previously herein with reference to general 5  formula I);<br>
(a)(iii) an allyl functional monomer represented by the following general formula IV,<br>

unsubstituted allyl group as described previously herein with reference to general formula I); and<br>
(a)(iv) mixtures at least two of (a)(i), (a)(ii) and (a)(iii).<br>
15	In an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
first allyl functional monomer (a)(ii) is 4,4'-isopropylidenebisphenol bis(allyl carbonate), which can be described with reference to general formula III, wherein Rj and R2 are each hydrogen, -X- is -C(CH3)2-, R, is an unubstituted<br>
20  allyl group, and the allyl carbonate groups (R3-0-C(0)-O-) are located at the 4 and 4' positions relative to the divalent linking group -X-.  In a further embodiment of the present invention, the first allyl functional monomer (a)(iii) is diallyl isophthalate, which can be described with reference to<br>
25  general formula IV, wherein R, is an unsubstituted allyl group,<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
and the allyl ester groups (R,-0-C{0)-) are located at the 1 and 3 positions of the aromatic ring.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first allyl functional monomer is allyl functional monomer 5 (a)(i) represented by general formula II. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first allyl functional monomer is allyl functional monomer (a)(i), wherein R of general formula II is a residue of 1,2-ethane diol (ethylene glycol) and R14 is an unsubstituted allyl group, in<br>
10  which case the first allyl functional monomer is ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate). As used herein and in the claims, with reference to the first allyl functional monomer, the terms polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer and poly(allyl ester) monomer and more specific related terms (e.g., ethylene<br>
15  glycol bis(allyl carbonate), 4,4'-isopropylidenebisphenol<br>
bis(allyl carbonate) and diallyl isophthallate) are intended to mean and include the named monomer or prepolymers thereof and any related monomer or oligomer species and any synthetic coproducts contained therein.<br>
20	The polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers of the first<br>
allyl functional monomer may be prepared by procedures well known in the art, e.g., as described in U.S. Patents 2,370,567 and 2,403,113.  For example, an aliphatic polyol, such as ethylene glycol, is reacted with phosgene at temperatures<br>
25  typically between 0°c and 20°C to form the corresponding polychloroformate, e.g., ethylene bis(chloroformate).  The polychloroformate is then reacted with a substituted or unsubstituted allyl alcohol in the presence of a suitable acid acceptor, e.g., an alkali metal hydroxide.  Alternatively, an<br>
30  allyl or substituted allyl chloroformate (formed from the<br>
reaction of allyl or substituted allyl alcohol with phosgene) is reacted with the polyol in the presence of an acid acceptor.<br><br>

PCT7US01/10081<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
The poly(allyl ester) monomers of the first allyl functional monomer may be prepared by procedures well known to the skilled artisan.  Typically, an ester, e.g., diethyl isophthalate, is transesterified with an allyl alcohol, e.g., 5  unsubstituted allyl alcohol.<br>
The first allyl functional monomer is typically present in the polymerizable composition of the present invention in an amount of at least 25 percent by weight, preferably at least 40 percent by weight, further preferably<br>
10  at least 45 percent by weight, and more preferably at least 50 percent by weight, percent weights being based on the total monomer weight of the composition.  The first allyl functional monomer is typically present in the polymerizable composition in an amount of less than 90 percent by weight, preferably<br>
15  less than 70 percent by weight, and more preferably less than 60 percent by weight, percent weights being based on the total monomer weight of the composition.  The first allyl functional monomer may be present in the polymerizable composition of the present invention in an amount ranging between any combination<br>
20  of these upper and lower values, inclusive of the recited values.<br>
The polymerizable composition of the present invention also comprises a second allyl functional monomer, which is different than the first allyl functional monomer.<br>
25  The second allyl functional monomer may be prepared in<br>
accordance with those art-recognized methods as described previously herein with regard to the polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers of the first allyl functional monomer.<br>
The second allyl functional monomer may be selected<br>
30  from polyether diol bis(allyl carbonate) monomers.  The polyether diol of the polyether diol bis(allyl carbonate) monomer may be selected from homopolymeric polyether diols,<br><br>

random copolymeric polyether diols, block copolymeric polyether diols and mixtures thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the polyether diol of the polyether diol bis(allyl carbonate) 5  monomer is a block copolymeric polyether diol, which may be represented by the following general formula V,<br>
V<br>
H-0-(-RsO-)—(R70-)-(-R80-)—H x     y     z<br>
wherein RtO  and R80 are the same or different; R70 is different<br>
10  than each of R60 and R80; R60, R70 and R90 are each<br>
independently a divalent residue of an epoxide; x and z are each independently a number from 0 to 200, provided that the sum of x and z is greater than zero; and y is a number from 3 to 200.<br>
15	With further reference to general formula V, -R,0-<br>
(R60) , -R70- (R70) and -R„0- (RsO) are each independently a divalent residue of an epoxide. As used herein, the term "epoxide" refers to three membered cyclic ethers, e.g., ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.  For purposes of<br>
20  illustration, when R(0 is a residue of propylene oxide, the divalent -R60- residue may be represented by the following general formulas VI and VII,<br>
VI	VII<br>
— CH2—CH-0		—CH—CH2—O	<br>
CH3	CH3<br>
25  When RsO is a residue of propylene oxide, it may, more<br>
specifically, be represented by formula VI, formula VII or a combination of formulas VI and VII.  Due to the steric hindrance of the pendent methyl group of propylene oxide, formula VI is believed to be the predominant representation<br>
30  relative to formula VII, as is known to the skilled artisan.<br><br>

The -(R60)x-, -(R,'0)y- and -(R,0),- segments or blocks of general formula V, may contain one or more species of epoxide residues, preferably they each contain a single species of epoxide residues.  Classes of epoxides of which Rs0, 5  R,0 and RsO may each independently be residues of include, but are not limited to, C2-C14 alkylene oxide, cycloalkylene oxide having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring and mixtures thereof.  Examples of C2-C„ alkylene oxideB include, but are not limited to, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, (2,3-<br>
10  epoxypropyl)benzene, l,2-epoxy-3-phenoxypropane, butylene oxide, e.g., 1,2-butylene oxide and 2,3-butylene oxide, pentylene oxide, e.g., 1,2-pentylene oxide and 2,3-pentylene oxide, hexylene oxide, e.g., 1,2-hexylene oxide, octylene oxide, e.g., 1,2-octylene oxide, decylene oxide, e.g., 1,2-<br>
15  epoxydecane, dodecylene oxide, e.g., 1,2-epoxydodecane, and epoxytetradecane, e.g., 1,2-epoxytetradecane.  Examples of cycloalkylene oxide having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring include, but are not limited to, cyclopentene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, exo-2,3-epoxynorborane, cyclooctene oxide<br>
20  and cyclododecane epoxide.  Typically, R60, R70 and R,0 are each independently a divalent residue of an epoxide selected from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide and mixtures thereof.<br>

20	The polymerizable composition of the present<br>
invention may be prepared by preparing separately the first, second and optional third monomers, and then mixing the separately prepared first, second and optional third monomers together, thereby forming the polymerizable composition.  In<br>
25  another embodiment of the present invention, the first allyl functional monomer is a polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer, and the polymerizable composition is prepared by a method comprising:<br>
(a) preparing separately a first chloroformate<br>
30  intermediate of the first allyl functional monomer, a second chloroformate intermediate of the second allyl functional monomer, and optionally a third chloroformate intermediate of the third allyl functional monomer;<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
-   21   -<br>
(b)	forming a mixture of the first chloroformate<br>
intermediate, the second chloroformate intermediate, and<br>
optionally the third chloroformate intermediate; and<br>
(c)	reacting the chloroformate groups (-O-C(O)-Cl<br>
5  groups) of the mixture of the first chloroformate<br>
intermediate, second chloroformate intermediate and optionally the third chloroformate intermediate with allyl alcohol (e.g., a substituted and/or unsubstituted allyl alcohol), thereby forming the polymerizable composition.<br>
10	In a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the third allyl functional monomer is prepared separately from the concurrent preparation of the first and second allyl functional monomers (i.e., in accordance with the above described method, in which the chloroformate groups of a<br>
15  mixture of the first and second chloroformate intermediates are reacted concurrently with allyl alcohol).  The separately prepared third allyl functional monomer is then added to the concurrently prepared mixture of the first and second allyl functional monomers, thereby forming a polymerizable<br>
20  composition comprising the first, second and third allyl functional monomers.<br>
Preparation of the chloroformate intermediates and the subsequent reaction with allyl alcohol may be conducted in accordance with art-recognized methods, e.g., as described<br>
25  previously herein with regard to the preparation of the<br>
polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers of the first allyl functional monomer.  As is known to the skilled artisan, the reaction of chloroformate groups with allyl alcohol is typically performed in the presence of an acid scavenger, e.g., an alkali metal<br>
30 hydroxide, followed by washing and isolation of the resulting mixture of polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers. While the molar equivalents ratio of allyl alcohol to chloroformate groups of the mixture of chloroformate intermediates in step (c) may be<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
-   22   -<br>
less than 1 r 1, it is preferred that the ratio be at least 1 : l (i.e., all of the chloroformate groups are preferably reacted with allyl alcohol).  In step (c) of the method of preparing the polymerizable composition, the molar equivalents 5  ratio of allyl alcohol to chloroformate groups is typically from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1.0, e.g., 1.1 : 1.0.<br>
For purposes of illustration, when the first allyl functional monomer is ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), the first chloroformate intermediate is ethylene glycol<br>
10  bis (chloroformate) ,• when the second allyl functional monomer is a poly(diethylene glycol/epsilon-caprolactone)diol bis(allyl carbonate), the second chloroformate intermediate is poly(diethylene glycol/epsilon-caprolactone)diol bis(chloroformate); and when the optional third allyl<br>
15  functional monomer is diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), the third chloroformate intermediate is diethylene glycol bis(chloroformate).  The mixture of chloroformate intermediates may be formed according to methods that are well known to the skilled artisan, e.g., by mixing with an impeller<br>
20  under an inert atmosphere, such as a nitrogen.<br>
Polymerization of the polymerizable composition of the present invention may be accomplished by adding to the composition an initiating amount of material capable of generating free radicals, such as organic peroxy compounds,<br>
25  i.e., an initiator.  Methods for polymerizing polyoKallyl<br>
carbonate) compositions are well known to the skilled artisan and any of those well known techniques may be used to polymerize the aforedescribed polymerizable compositions.<br>
Suitable examples of organic peroxy compounds, that<br>
30 may be used as initiators include:  peroxymonocarbonate esters, such as tertiarybutylperoxy isopropyl carbonate; peroxydicarbonate esters, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) peroxydicarbonate, di(secondary butyl) peroxydicarbonate and<br><br>

diisopropylperoxydicarbonate; diacylperoxides, such as 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, propionyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, p-chlorobenzoyl peroxide; 5  peroxyesters such as t-butylperoxy pivalate, t-butylperoxy octylate, and t-butylperoxyisobutyrate; methylethylketone peroxide, acetylcyclohexane sulfonyl peroxide, and azobisisobutyronitrile.  Preferred initiators are those that do not discolor the resulting polymerizate. A preferred<br>
10  initiator is diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate.<br>
The amount of initiator used to initiate and polymerize the polymerizable compositions of the present invention may vary and will depend on the particular initiator used.  Only that amount that is required to initiate and<br>
15  sustain the polymerization reaction is required, i.e., an initiating amount.  With respect to the preferred peroxy compound, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, typically between 2.0 and 5.0 parts of that initiator per 100 parts of monomer (phm) may be used.  More usually, between 2.5 and 4.0 phm is used to<br>
20  initiate the polymerization.  The amount of initiator and the consequent cure cycle should be adequate to produce a polymerizate having a 0 second Barcol 935 hardness (i.e., as measured using a Model No. 935 Barcol Impressor) of at least 65, preferably at least 70, e.g., from 70 to 80.  Typically,<br>
25  the cure cycle involves heating the polymerizable organic composition in the presence of the initiator from room temperature to 94°C over a period of from 15 hours to 30 hours.<br>
Various conventional additives may be incorporated<br>
3 0  into the polymerizable composition of the present invention. Such conventional additives may include light stabilizers, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers, mold release agents, such as internal mold release agents, pigments and<br><br>

flexibilizing additives that are not radically polymerizable, e.g., alkoxylated phenol benzoates and poly(alkylene glycol) dibenzoates.  Conventional additives are typically present in the compositions of the present invention in amounts totaling 5  less than 10 percent by weight, more typically less than 5 percent by weight, and commonly less than 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition.<br>

15  to prepare photochromic articles, e.g., photochromic lenses, the polymerizate should be transparent to that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum which activates the photochromic substance(s) incorporated in the matrix, i.e., that wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the colored or open<br>

Each of the photochromic substances described herein may be used in amounts and in a ratio (when mixtures are used) such that a polymerizate to which the mixture of<br>
20  compounds is applied or in which they are incorporated<br>
exhibits a desired resultant color, e.g., a substantially neutral color such as shades of gray or brown when activated with unfiltered sunlight, i.e., as near a neutral color as possible given the colors of the activated photochromic<br>
25  substances.  The relative amounts of the aforesaid<br>
photochromic substances used will vary and depend in part upon the relative intensities of the color of the activated species of such compounds, and the ultimate color desired.<br>
The photochromic compounds or substances described<br>
30 herein may be applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate by various methods described in the art. Such methods include: (a) dissolving or dispersing the substance within the polymerizate, e.g., imbibition of the photochromic substance<br><br>
WO 01/77194<br><br>
PCT/US01/10081<br><br>
-   27   -<br>
into the polymerizate by immersion of the polymerizate in a hot solution of the photochromic substance or by thermal transfer; (b) providing the photochromic substance as a separate layer between adjacent layers of the polymerizate, 5  e.g., as a part of a polymer film; and (c) applying the photochromic substance as part of a coating placed on the surface of the polymerizate.<br>
Preferably, photochromic substances are incorporated into the polymerizates, and in particular,<br>
10  substantially completely cured polymerizates of the present invention by means of imbibition.  The term "imbibition" or "imbibe" is intended to mean and include permeation of the photochromic substance alone into the polymerizate, solvent assisted transfer absorption of the photochromic substance<br>
15  into a porous polymer, vapor phase transfer, and other such transfer mechanisms.<br>
The amount of photochromic substance or composition containing same applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate is not critical provided that a sufficient amount<br>
20  is used to produce a photochromic effect discernible to the naked eye upon activation.  Generally such amount can be described as a photochromic amount.  The particular amount used depends often upon the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof and upon the method used to incorporate or<br>
25 apply the photochromic substances. Typically, the more<br>
photochromic substance applied or incorporated, the greater is the color intensity.  Generally, the amount of total photochromic substance incorporated into or applied to a photochromic optical polymerizate may range from 0.15 to<br>
30  0.35 milligrams per square centimeter of surface to which the photochromic substance(s) is incorporated or applied. The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples, which are intended to be<br><br>

Cast sheets of the polymerizable monomer compositions of Table 1 were made in the following manner. Each monomer composition was transferred to a suitable vessel<br>
10  and the designated amount of di-isopropyl peroxydicarbonate was added.  The resulting initiated polymerizable monomer composition was mixed using a magnetic stir plate and magnetic stir bar at a temperature of 4°c. The initiated monomer composition was then filtered through a 0.45 micron MAGNA<br>
15  nylon filter using a 316 stainless steel 1.5 liter pressure filter holder, under 20 pounds per square inch (138 kPa) of nitrogen gas.  The resulting filtered composition was then poured into glass molds having interior dimensions of, 15.24 x 15.24 x 0.32 cm.<br>

Photochromic Article Examples 4-6<br>
20	Additional test samples were cut from the cast<br>
sheets prepared from polymerizable compositions of Examples 1 - 3, as described previously herein. Example 4 represents an attempt to imbibe a sheet cast from the polymerizable composition of Example 1.  Examples 5 and 6 represent sheets 25  cast from the polymerizable compositions of Examples 2 and 3 respectively, that were each successfully imbibed with photochromic substance.  The test samples were imbibed with a resin solution containing 40 percent by weight of PHOTOSOL® 7-219 photochromic substance, 16 percent by weight of PHOTOSOL® 30  7-330 photochromic substance and 44 percent by weight of<br>
PHOTOSOL® 7-232 photochromic substance, the percent weights being based on the total weight of photochromic substances<br><br>

present in the resin solution.  The PHOTOSOL® 7-219, PHOTOSOL®<br>
7-330 and PHOTOSOL® 7-232 materials are naphthopyran<br>
photochromic substances available commercially from PPG<br>
Industries, Inc.<br>
5	Resin solutions of the photochromic substances were<br>
spin coated onto one side of the test sample sheets.  The coated test sheets were then allowed to dry under an infrared lamp for 20 minutes followed by heating for 5 hours in a forced air oven set at 135°C.  The imbibed test samples were<br>
10 removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The imbibed test samples were then thoroughly washed with 32°C water to remove the resin solution.<br>
Photochromic performance data for the imbibed test sheets were determined through use of an optical bench.  Prior<br>
15  to testing on the optical bench, the imbibed test sheets were exposed to 365 nanometer ultraviolet light for about 15 minutes to activate the photochromic compounds and then placed in a 76 °C oven for about 15 minutes to bleach or inactivate the photochromic substances.  The imbibed test sheets were<br>
20  then cooled to room temperature, exposed to fluorescent room lighting for at least 2 hours and then kept covered for at least 2 hours prior to testing on an optical bench maintained at 23.9°C.<br>
The optical bench was equipped with a 300 watt<br>
25  Xenon arc lamp operated at about 200 watts, a remote<br>
controlled shutter, a Schott WG-320 nm cut off filter, which removes short wavelength radiation, neutral density filter(s) and a constant temperature water bath in which the sample to be tested was immersed.  A collimated beam of light from a<br>
3 0  tungsten lamp was passed through the test sample at a small angle to the normal of the center of the test sample. After passing through the test sample, the light from the tungsten lamp impinged a beam splitter which split the beam into two<br><br>

The unreflected secondary beam was directed through a 620 nm band pass photopic filter to a detector.  The 5  photopic filter passes wavelengths such that the detector<br>
mimics the response of the human eye.  The output signals from the detector(s) were processed by a radiometer which delivered data to a computer. The following Table 3 lists photochromic performance data obtained from the imbibed test sheets.<br>

scale to 100%, opening the shutter from the Xenon lamp to provide ultraviolet radiation to change the test square from the bleached state to an activated (i.e., substantially darkened) state, measuring the transmittance in the activated 5  state, and calculating the change in optical density according the formula AOD=log(100/%Ta) where %Ta is the percent transmittance in the activated state and the logarithm is to the base 10.  The period of exposure to the ultraviolet light from the Xenon lamp at the time the percent transmittance is 10  determined, and the temperature of the water bath, are both noted.<br>
(p) The Bleach Half Life (Ti/2)   is the time interval in seconds for the absorbance of the activated form of the imbibed lens 15  to reach one half the highest absorbance at 23°C after removal of the source of activating light.<br>
The data of Table 4 shows that photochromic articles made from substantially completely cured 20 polymerizates of the present invention have improved organic photochromic substance incorporation and good photochromic performance properties compared to substantially completely cured polymerizates prepared from the first allyl functional monomer alone, e.g., ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate)<br>
