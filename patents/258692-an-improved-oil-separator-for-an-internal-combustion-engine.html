BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, A novel oil separator for internal combustion engine comprises; divergent housing (06), inlet (01) of oil separator for blow by gas, outlet (09) for oil separator for oil free blow by gases, oil outlet (10) for separated oil. According to present invention, blow by gas is directed through said inlet (01) and impacts on strainer plate (02). The blow by gas then flows through small orifices of said plate (02) with high velocity and hits the impact plates (03, 04). The separated oil drains through holes (13) provided on said plate (02) and impact plate (04) to said oil outlet (10). The said impact plates (03,04) and baffle plate (05) also reduce the velocity of blow by gas due to change in flow direction of the same. The said impact plates (03, 04) also act as baffle plates. This helps further to separate entrained oil from the blow by gas.<br><br><br>
Finally the said divergent type housing (06) also helps to reduce velocity head of blow by gases along the flow direction thereby further separating oil from blow by gases. The separated oil drains to said oil outlet (10) through said oil holes (13) on said strainer plate (02) and impact plate (04). The divergent type housing (06) also helps to drain oil towards oil outlet (10). Thus oil free blow by gases pass through (09) towards air induction system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Now referring to the figure 1 to 5 , A novel oil separator for internal combustion engine comprises ; divergent housing (06), inlet (01) of oil separator for blow by gas, outlet (09) for oil separator for oil free blow by gases, oil outlet (10) for separated oil. According to present invention, blow by gas is directed through said inlet (01) and impacts on strainer plate (02). The blow by gas then flows through small orifices of said plate (02) with high velocity and hits the impact plates (03, 04). The separated oil drains through holes (13) provided on said plate (02) and<br><br><br>
impact plate (04) to said oil outlet (10). The said impact plates (03,04) and baffle plate (05) also reduce the velocity of blow by gas due to change in flow direction of the same. The said impact plates (03,04) also act as baffle plates. This helps further to separate entrained oil from the blow by gas.<br>
Finally the said divergent type housing (06) also helps to reduce velocity head of blow by gases along the flow direction thereby further separating oil from blow by gases. The separated oil drains to said oil outlet (10) through said oil holes (13) on said strainer plate (02) and impact plate (04). The divergent type housing (06) also helps to drain oil towards oil outlet (10). Thus oil free blow by gases pass through (09) towards air induction system.<br>
If air filter gets choked, the total suction pressure will act on oil separator unit. The diaphragm (07) provided between rear cover (08) and said housing (06) ,will close outlet pipe (09) under sudden intake depression. The said Rear cover with holes (08) assists the said diaphragm in closing the outlet pipe (09). The hole (12) on the outlet pipe (09) is made inclined to change the suction direction away from oil outlet (10) centre. The resilient means (11) provided between diaphragm and out let pipe for keeping blow by gases outlet (09) open during normal operating conditions. The O ring (14) acts as a sealing means to avoid the leakage of blow by gases to the atmosphere.<br>
Said strainer plate comprises orifices through which high velocity blow by gases are allowed to hit on impact plates. Said outlet for oil separator for oil free blow by gases comprises holes. Said holes are inclined to change the suction direction away from the centre of oil outlet for separated lubricating oil. Said divergent housing comprises sealing means. Said sealing means is a ring. Said second impact plate comprises drain hole to drain the separated oil.<br><br><br>
The general arrangement of the oil separator in internal combustion engine includes cylinder head cover, oil separator, and oil sump and air intake system. To remove the entrained lubricating oil from blow by gases, oil separator is mounted as close to cylinder head cover as possible. Blow by gases coming from the cylinder head are made to pass through the oil separator which separates oil from them and oil free blow by are again supplied to the air induction system of the engine. Oil which has been taken out from the blow by gases is again send back to the oil sump.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
