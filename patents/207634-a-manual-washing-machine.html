Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a manual washing machine. The machine is useful to wash the cloths and to exercise as trading mill.<br>
Description of Prior Art<br>
The prior art reveals existence of many washing machines but all the conventional machines are operated by the means of electricity. A washing machine disclosed in US Patent No. 5903120 comprises a foot pedal, which is connected to door by wire arrangement such that to open the door as and when required by the user.<br>
Another washing machine disclosed in Chinese patent CN1041192 comprises pedaling means so as to provide the manual action of griping, rubbing, forking and kneading. The structure of the washing machine is as simple as the existing washing machine basically.<br>
Disadvantages of Prior Art<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the prior art. One of the main disadvantage is that all the conventional machines are operable on electricity and a lot of energy is required for its operation.<br>
Another disadvantage is that continuous power supply is required for the operation of the conventional machine and there the conventional machines are of no use for the rural areas.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the conventional machines can only be operated by a person skilled in the art<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional machines are of very high cost and beyond the reach of the common man. Also the maintenance of the conventional machine is very high.<br>
A further disadvantages associated with the conventional manual washing machine is that lot of mechanism is provided to operate the machine. Therefore, machine is a very complicated in construction.<br><br>
Object and Advantages of the Present Invention<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to propose a novel manual washing machine.<br>
Another object of present invention is to propose a manually operable Washing Machine which is very easy to operate and maintenance thereof is very easy.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose manually operable Washing Machine, which is very cheap and is portable.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a washing machine which can be operated anywhere in the world. The machine can be taken to the site where the washing operation is required.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a washing machine, which is also useful as an exercising machine simultaneously.<br>
The following description contains many specifics but these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention. These specifics may be treated as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. Accordingly the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a manual washing machine for cleansing clothes comprising an outer casing having a cover on the top end thereof, a cylindrical perforated drum mounted on a shaft being disposed in said casing rotatably, pedals secured with said shaft being provided on both sides of said casing, an opening being provided on one side of said perforated drum for loading and unloading the cloths in said drum, a water inlet is provided at the top end of the said casing, an outlet being provided at the bottom end of said casing<br><br>
Brief Description regarding the Present Invention<br>
In accordance with this invention a manually operable washing machine for cleansing clothes has an outer casing having a door at the top end thereof. A perforated cylindrical drum is provided inside the outer casing rotatably. The perforated cylindrical drum is mounted on the sides of the outer casing by means of bearings provided in the bearing houses. The bearing houses are secured with the side walls of the outer casing. A paddle is secured with the shaft at both the end of the shaft. The paddles are provided on either sides of the outer casing such that to rotate said shaft/drum by the user manually as and when required. An opening is provided in the perforated drum for loading and unloading the cloths, to be. washed into the drum. An inlet is provided at the top of the casing for filling the water in the outer casing. An outlet is provided in the bottom end of the casing for darning out the water after the washing operation is over.<br>
Detailed Description regarding the Present Invention<br>
A manual washing machine according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein;<br>
Fig. 1 shows the perspective view of the manual washing machine<br>
Fig 2 shows sectional view of manual washing machine<br>
Fig 3 shows perspective view washing drum<br>
Fig 4 shows perspective view of the side support of washing drum<br>
Fig 5 shows perspective view of the side support according to an option<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig 1 and Fig 2, the washing machine has outer casing (1) for storing the water therein for use for washing purposes. A washing drum (2) mounted on a central shaft (3) is disposed to the outer casing (1). The washing drum (2) has a wire mesh (4) secured at the outer periphery of the side supports for example circular disk (5) (see Fig 4). A lid (6) is provided with the wire mesh (4) for loading and unloading the cloths into and from the washing drum (2). The shaft (3) having washing drum (2) mounted thereon is supported on the opposite sides (7) of the outer casing (1) by means of bearing disposed in bearing houses (8)   secured at the outer surface of casing<br><br>
(1). Pedals (9) are provided on either ends of the shaft (3) outside the casing (1) for providing rotational movement manually to the washing drum (2) for washing purposes. A water inlet (10) is provided on the top cover (11) of the casing (1) for providing supply of water into the casing (1) during the washing operation as and when required. A'water outlet (12) is provided at one side near the bottom end of the casing (1) for draining the water from the casing (1) during the washing operation as and when required. Handles (13) are provided with the outer casing (1) for facilitating the transportation of washing machine from one place to another.<br>
According to an option the side supports comprises a central circular ring (14) (see Fig 5) having a plurality of supporting strips (15) secured therewith for holding the circular wire mesh (16) therewith. Similarly according to an option caster wheels (not shown) are provided at the outer surface of the bottom for transporting the machine from one place to another.<br>
During the operation of the machine the user loads the cloths through doors provided in the outer casing and the perforated drum. The water is then filled in the outer casing and the soap is added into the water. The lid of the machine is then closed and the user rides sits on the top of the outer casing and start rotating the drum with help of the paddles. After some time the user opens the tap provided at the bottom end of the outer casing to drain out dirty water and fills the fresh water in the casing to start the washing operation again till the cloths are washed completely. Thus it is seen that the machine proposed by the present invention is very useful.<br><br><br><br>
