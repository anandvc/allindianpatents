7-Amino Alkvfideny-Heterocyclic Quinolones and Naphthyridones<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of Application Serial Number<br>
10/937238, filed September 9, 2004.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The subject invention relates to novel antimicrobial compounds, their<br>
compositions and their uses.<br>
Background<br>
The chemical and medical literature describes compounds that are said<br>
to be antimicrobial, i.e., capable of destroying or suppressing the growth or<br>
reproduction of microorganisms, such as bacteria. For example, such<br>
antibacterial agents are described in Antibiotics, Chemotherapeutics, and<br>
Antibacterial Agents for Disease Control (M. Greyson, editor, 1982), E. Gale et<br>
al., The Molecular Basis of Antibiotic Action 2d edition (1981), Recent<br>
Research Developments in Antimicrobial Agents &amp; Chemotherapy (S. G.<br>
Pandalai, Editor, 2001), Quinolone Antimicrobial Agents (John S Wolfson.,<br>
David C Hooper, Editors, 1989), and F. O'Grady, H. P. Lambert, R. G. Finch,<br>
D. Greenwood, Martin Dedicoat, "Antibiotic and Chemotherapy, 7th edn."<br>
(1997).<br>
The mechanisms of action of these antibacterial agents vary. However,<br>
they are generally believed to function in one or more ways: by inhibiting cell<br>
wall synthesis or repair; by altering cell wall permeability; by inhibiting protein<br>
synthesis; or by inhibiting the synthesis of nucleic acids. For example, beta-<br>
lactam antibacterial agents act through inhibiting essential penicillin binding<br>
proteins (PBPs) in bacteria, which are responsible for cell wall synthesis. As<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/101603<br><br>
PCT/US2006/003657<br><br>
another example, quinolones act, at least in part by inhibiting synthesis of DNA,<br>
thus preventing the cell from replicating.<br>
The pharmacological characteristics of antimicrobial agents, and their<br>
suitability for any given clinical use, vary. For example, the classes of<br>
antimicrobial agents (and members within a class) may vary in 1) their relative<br>
efficacy against different types of microorganisms, 2) their susceptibility to<br>
development of microbial resistance and 3) their pharmacological<br>
characteristics such as their bioavailability and biodistribution. Accordingly,<br>
selection of an appropriate antimicrobial agent in a given clinical situation<br>
requires analysis of many factors, including the type of organism involved, the<br>
desired method of administration, the location of the infection to be treated and<br>
other considerations.<br>
However, many such attempts to produce improved antimicrobial agents<br>
yield equivocal results. Indeed, few antimicrobial agents are produced that are<br>
truly clinically acceptable in terms of their spectrum of antimicrobial activity,<br>
avoidance of microbial resistance, and pharmacology. Thus there is a<br>
continuing need for broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, which are effective<br>
against resistant microbes.<br>

Examples of bacterial infections resistant to antibiotic therapy have been<br>
reported in the past; they are now a significant threat to public health in the<br>
developed world. The development of microbial resistance (perhaps as a<br>
result of the intense use of antibacterial agents over extended periods of time)<br>
is of increasing concern in medical science. "Resistance" can be defined as<br>
existence of organisms, within a population of a given microbial species, that<br>
are less susceptible to the action of a given antimicrobial agent. This<br>
resistance is of particular concern in environments such as hospitals and<br>
nursing homes, where relatively high rates of infection and intense use of<br>
antibacterial agents are common. See, e.g., W. Sanders, Jr. et al., "Inducible<br>
Beta-lactamases: Clinical and Epidemiologic Implications for the Use of Newer<br>
Cephalosporins", Review of Infectious Diseases, p. 830 (1988).<br>
Pathogenic bacteria are known to acquire resistance via several distinct<br>
mechanisms including inactivation of the antibiotic by bacterial enzymes (e.g.,<br>
B-lactamases hydrolyzing penicillin and cephalosporins); removal of the<br>
antibiotic using efflux pumps; modification of the target of the antibiotic via<br>
mutation and genetic recombination (e.g., penicillin-resistance in Neiserria<br>
gonorrhoeae); and acquisition of a readily transferable gene from an external<br>
source to create a resistant target (e.g., methicillin-resistance in<br>
Staphylococcus aureus). There are certain Gram-positive pathogens, such as<br>
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, which are resistant to virtually all<br>
commercially available antibiotics.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/101603	PCT/US2006/003657<br>
Hence existing antibacterial agents have limited capacity in overcoming<br>
the threat ot resistance. Thus it would be advantageous to provide new<br>
antibacterial agents that can be used against resistant microbes.<br>

preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared as a single<br>
stereoisomer or in racemic form as a mixture of some possible stereoisomers.<br>
The non-racemic forms may be obtained by either synthesis or resolution. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt<br>

General Reaction Scheme for Compound Preparation<br>
In making the compounds of the invention, the order of synthetic steps<br>
may be varied to increase the yield of desired product. In addition, the skilled<br>
artisan will also recognize the judicious choice of reactions, solvents, and<br>
temperatures are an important component in successful synthesis. While the<br>
determination of optimal conditions, etc. is routine, it will be understood that a<br>
variety of compounds can be generated in a similar fashion, using the guidance<br>
of the schemes below.<br>
The starting materials used in preparing the compounds of the invention<br>
are known, made by published synthetic methods or available from commercial<br>
vendors.<br>
It is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can<br>
readily carry out standard manipulations of the organic compounds without<br>
further direction; that is, it is well within the scope and practice of the skilled<br>
artisan to carry out such manipulations. These include, but are not limited to,<br>
reductions of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, oxidations,<br>
acylations, aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic,<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/101603<br><br>
PCT/US2006/003657<br><br>
etherifications, esterification and saponification and the like. Examples of<br>
these manipulations are discussed in standard texts such as March, Advanced<br>
Organic Chemistry (Wiley), Carey and Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry<br>
(Vol. 2), Feiser &amp; Feiser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis (16 volumes), L.<br>
Paquette, Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (8 volumes), Frost<br>
&amp; Fleming, Comprehensive Organic Synthesis (9 volumes) and the like.<br>
The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that certain reactions are best<br>
carried out when other functionality is masked or protected in the molecule,<br>
thus avoiding any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the<br>
reaction. Often the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such<br>
increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. Examples of these<br>
manipulations can be found for example in T. Greene, Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis.<br>

and both Rg and R10 are hydrogen, selective alkylation of the side chain amine<br>
of LXI may also be accomplished by protection of the amine with a standard<br>
protecting group, such as Boc, utilizing reagents and conditions apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art to give LXII (Scheme XXXVI). The protected amine<br>
(LX1I) is then treated with an excess (&gt;2 equivalents) of a base, such as, but<br>
not limited to, sodium hydride, in an appropriate inert solvent, such as<br>
dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran, followed by the appropriate alkylating<br>
agent R9X to yield the boc-protected secondary amine as the corresponding<br>
ester LXIII. Typically, the reaction is run at temperatures ranging from -20°C<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/101603	PCT/US2006/003657<br>
to 60°C for from 1 to 48 hours depending on the reactivity of the alkylating<br>
agent. Typical alkylating agents including alkyl iodides (such as methyl iodide),<br>
alkyl bromides and alkyl sulfonates. The ester LXIII may be hydrolyzed under<br>
basic conditions to afford the corresponding carboxylic acid LXIV. Ester<br>
hydrolysis may be conducted by methods familiar to those skilled in the art, in<br>
particular, by employing a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide (for example,<br>
sodium hydroxide) or an alkali metal carbonate in a suitable solvent, such as<br>
water, methanol, ethanol, or aqueous alcohol mixtures, at a temperature<br>
ranging from 20°C to 100°C for from 1 to 48 hours. Removal of the amine-<br>
protecting group under conditions apparent to one skilled in the art affords the<br>
secondary amine LXV. In the case where the protecting group is Boc, for<br>
example, reagents such as with trifluoroacetic acid, optionally with methylene<br>

deprotection.<br><br>

Occasionally, side chain amines are insufficiently reactive to add<br>
efficiently to the heterocyclic nuclei (II or X) under the conditions illustrated in<br>
Schemes l-IV, particularly when A is C(Rn), wherein H^ is alkoxy. The<br>
nucleus can be activated towards nucleophilic attack by the addition of a Lewis<br>
acid such as, but not limited to, boron trifluoride, triacetoxyborate, and lithium<br>
chloride. The preferred method of activation is described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,157,117. The quinolone nucleus is treated with triacetoxyborate, prepared in<br>
situ, in solvent such as, but not limited to, acetic acid or propionic acid and is<br>
heated for 1 to 24 h at a temperature between 60°C and 120°C. The diacyl<br>

preferably in a suitable solvent, such as THF, for from 1 hour to 48 hours at<br>
temperatures ranging from 0°C to 60°C. After cooling, the product LXVI may<br>

chloride for 1 to 24 h at a temperature between -78°C to 120°C in the presence<br>
of a base such as, but not limited to n-butyl lithium, sodium hydride or<br>
potassium carbonate. The resulting ester (XVII) can be reduced with a<br>
reducing agent such as, but not limited to, diisobutylaluminum hydride, lithium<br>

triethylborohydride or sodium borohydride in a solvent such as, but not limited<br>
to, toluene, methylene chloride, or tetrahydrofuran for 1 to 24 h at a<br>
temperature between 0°C and 120°C to afford the corresponding alcohol XVIII,<br>
where q = 1. Converting the alcohol XVIII to leaving group XIX, such as, but<br>
not limited to, chloride, bromide, mesylate or tosylate under standard<br>
conditions and displacing the leaving group with an appropriately substituted<br>
amine in a solvent such as, but not limited to, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, or tetrahydrofuran for 1 to 24 h at a temperature between<br>
0°C and 120°C converts the alcohol XVIII to an amine XX. Removal of the<br>
protecting group, P, under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art<br>
affords amine III, wherein E is<br><br>
R7 and R8 are hydrogen, and q is 1. Alternatively, direct replacement of the<br>
alcohol XVIII can be accomplished via a Mitsunobu reaction with phthalimide<br>
and dialkyl azodicarboxylate to afford XXI. Deprotection of the phthalimide<br>
(XXI) with hydrazine in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol affords the<br>
amine (XX), wherein R9 and Rio are hydrogen. Alternative methods of<br>
deprotection include treatment with methylamine in methanol or with 6N<br>
hydrochloric acid. The protecting group, P, may be removed from XXI under<br>
standard conditions known to those skilled in the art to provide the amine V,<br>
wherein R7 and R8 are hydrogen and Rg and P" together with the nitrogen to<br>

the case where XVI is asymmetric (i.e., the value of m is not equal to n). In<br>
such a case, the geometrical isomers may be separated by a number of<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art, including selective recrystallization,<br>
flash chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and the like.<br>

Biological Activity<br>
The compounds described in the present invention possess antibacterial<br>
activity due to their novel structure, and are useful as antibacterial agents for<br>
the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals.<br>
Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been an indicator of in vitro<br>
antibacterial activity widely used in the art. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of<br>
the compounds was determined by the microdilution broth method following the<br>
test method from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards<br>
(NCCLS). This method is described in the NCCLS Document M7-A4, Vol.17,<br>
No.2, "Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test for Bacteria that<br>
Grow Aerobically--Fourth Edition", which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In this method two-fold serial dilutions of drug in cation adjusted Mueller-<br>
Hinton broth are added to wells in microdilution trays. The test organisms are<br>
prepared by adjusting the turbidity of actively growing broth cultures so that the<br>
final concentration of test organism after it is added to the wells is<br>
4<br>
approximately 5x10 CFU/well.<br>
Following inoculation of the microdilution trays, the trays are incubated<br>
at 35 °C for 16-20 hours and then read. The MIC is the lowest concentration of<br>
test compound that completely inhibits growth of the test organism. The<br>
amount of growth in the wells containing the test compound is compared with<br>
the amount of growth in the growth-control wells (no test compound) used in<br>
each tray. As set forth in Table 5, compounds of the present invention were<br>
tested against a variety of pathogenic bacteria resulting in a range of activities<br>
depending on the organism tested.<br>
