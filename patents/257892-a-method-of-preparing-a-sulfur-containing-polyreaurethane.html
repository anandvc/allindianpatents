				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001]    The present invention relates to sulfur-containing polyureaurethanee and methods for their preparation. <br>
[0002]    A number of organic polymeric materials, such aa plastics, have been developed as  alternatives and replacements for glass in applications such as optical lenses, fiber optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation transparencies. These polymeric materials can provide advantages relative to glass, including, shatter resistance, lighter weight for a given application, ease of molding and ease of dying. However, the refractive indices of many polymeric materials are generally lower than that of glass. In ophthalmic applications, the use of a polymeric material having a lower refractive index will require a thicker lens relative to a material having a higher refractive index.  A thicXer lens is not desirable.<br>
[0003]     Thus, there is a need in the art to develop a polymeric material having an adequate refractive index and good impact resistance/strength.<br>
[00O41    The present invention ie directed to a sulfur-containing polyureaurethane when at least partially cured having a refractive index of at least 1.57,an Abbe number of at least 32 and a density of less than 1.3 grams/cm3 . [0005]    Por the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly,<br>
unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention.  At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0006]    Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible.  Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
[0007]    As used herein and the claims, the term "cyanate" refers to isocyanate materials and isothiocyanate materials that are unblocked and capable of forming a covalent bond with a reactive group such as a thiol, hydroxyl, or amine function group.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the polycyanate of the present invention can contain at least two functional groups chosen from isocyanate (NCO), isothiocyanate (NCS), and combinations of isocyanate and isothiocyanate functional groups.  The term "isocyanate" refers to a cyanate which is free of sulfur.  The term "isothiocyanate" refers to a sulfur-containing cyanate.<br>
[0008]    In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the polyureaurethane of the invention when polymerized can produce a polymerizate having a refractive index of at least 1.57, or at least 1.58, or at least 1.60, or at least 1.62.  In further alternate non-limiting embodiments, the polyureaurethane of the invention when polymerized can produce a polymerizate having an Abbe number of at least 32, or at least 35, or at least 38, or at least 39, or at least 40, or at least 44.  The refractive index and Abbe number can be determined by methods<br>
known in the art such as American Standard Test Method (ASTM) Number D 542-00.  Further, the refractive index and Abbe number can be determined using various known instruments.  In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the refractive index and Abbe number can be measured in accordance with ASTM D 542-00 with the following exceptions:  (i) test i one to two samples/specimens instead of the minimum of three specimens specified in Section 7.3; and (ii) test the samples unconditioned instead of conditioning the samples/specimens prior to testing as specified in Section 8.1.  Further, in a non-limiting embodiment, an Atago, model DR-M2 Multi-Wavelength Digital Abbe Refractometer can be used to measure the refractive index and Abbe number of the samples/specimens. [0009]    In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the amount of polycyanate and the amount of active hydrogen-containing material can be selected such that the equivalent ratio of (NCO + NCS):(SH + OH) can be greater than 1.0:1.0, or at least 2.0:1.0, or at least 2.5:1, or less than 4.5:1.0, or less than 5.5:1.0.  In further alternate non-limiting embodiments, the equivalent ratio of (NCO + NCS)(SH + OH + NR), wherein R can be hydrogen or alkyl, can be greater than 1.0:1.0, or at least 2.0-.1.0, or at least 2.5:1, or less than 4.5:1.0, or less than 5.5:1.0.<br>

[00180]    In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic articles of the present invention can include one photochromic substance or a mixture of more than one photochromic substances.  In further alternate non-limiting embodiment, various mixtures of photochromic substances can be used to attain activated colors such as a near neutral gray or brown.<br>
[00181]   The amount of photochromic substance employed can vary.  In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the amount of photochromic substance and the ratio of substances (for example, when mixtures are used) can be such that the<br>
polymerizate to which the substance is applied or in which it is incorporated exhibits a desired resultant color, e.g., a substantially neutral color such as shades of gray or brown when activated with unfiltered sunlight, i.e., as near a neutral color as possible given the colors of the activated photochromic substances.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the amount of photochromic substance used can depend upon the intensity of the color of the activated species and the ultimate color desired.<br>
[00182]   In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic substance can be applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate by various methods known in the art. In a non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic substance can be dissolved or dispersed within the polymerizate.  In a further non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic substance can be imbibed into the polymerizate by methods known in the art. The term "imbibition" or "imbibe" includes permeation of the photochromic substance alone into the polymerizate, solvent assisted transfer absorption of the photochromic substance into a porous polymer, vapor phase transfer, and other such transfer mechanisms.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the imbibing method can include coating the photochromic article with the photochromic substance; heating the surface of the photochromic article; and removing the residual coating from the surface of the photochromic article. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the imbibtion process can include immersing the polymerizate in a hot solution of the photochromic substance or by thermal transfer. [00183]    In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic substance can be a separate layer between adjacent layers of the polymerizate, e.g., as a part of a polymer film; or the photochromic substance can be applied as a coating or as part of a coating placed on the surface of the polymerizate.<br>
[00184]   The amount of photochromic substance or composition containing the same applied to or incorporated into the<br>
polymerizate can vary.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the amount can be such that a photochromic effect discernible to the naked eye upon activation is produced.  Such an amount can be described in general as a photochromic amount.  In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the amount used can depend upon the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof and the method used to incorporate or apply the photochromic substance.  In general, the more photochromic substance applied or incorporated, the greater the color intensity.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the amount of photochromic substance incorporated into or applied onto a photochromic optical polymerizate can be from 0.15 to  0.35 milligrams per square centimeter of surface to which the photochromic substance is incorporated or applied.<br>
[00185]    In another embodiment, the photochromic substance can be added to the sulfur-containing polyureaurethane prior to polymerizing and/or cast curing the material.  In this embodiment, the photochromic substance used can be chosen such that it is resistant to potentially adverse interactions with, for example, the isocyanate, isothiocyante and amine groups present.  Such adverse interactions can result in deactivation of the photochromic substance, for example, by trapping them in either an open or closed form.<br>
[00186]    Further non-limiting examples of suitable photochromic substances for use in the present invention can include photochromic pigments and organic photochromic substances encapsulated in metal oxides such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,166,043 and 4,367,170; organic photochromic substances encapsulated in an organic polymerizate such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,931,220.<br>

EXAMPLE 1- Preparation of Reactive Polycyanate Prepolymer 1<br>
(RP1)<br>
[00188]    In a reaction vessel equipped with a paddle blade type stirrer, thermometer, gas inlet, and addition funnel, 11721 grams (89.30 equivalents of NCO) of Desmodur W obtained from Bayer Corporation, 5000 grams (24.82 equivalents of OH) of a 400 MW polycaprolactone diol (CAPA 2047A obtained from Solvay), 1195 grams (3.22 equivalents of OH) of 750 MW polycaprolactone diol (CAPA 2077A obtained from Solvay), and 217.4 grams (4.78 equivalents of OH) of trimethylol propane<br>
(TMP) obtained from Aldrich were charged. Desmodur W was obtained from Bayer Corporation and represents 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) containing 20% of the trans,trans isomer and 80% of the cis,cis and cis, trans isomers. The contents of the reactor were stirred at a rate of 150 rpm and a nitrogen blanket was applied as the reactor contents were heated to a temperature of 120°C at which time the reaction mixture began to exotherm.  The heat was removed and the temperature rose to a peak of 140°C for 30 minutes then began to cool.  Heat was applied to the reactor when the temperature reached 120°C and was maintained at that temperature for 4 hours.  The reaction mixture was sampled and analyzed for % NCO, according to the method described below in the embodiment.  The analytical result showed about 13.1.% free NCO groups. Before pouring out the contents of the reactor, 45.3 g of Irganox 1010 (obtained from Ciba Specialty Chemicals), a thermal stabilizer and 362.7 g of Cyasorb 5411<br>
 (obtained from Cytek), a UV stabilizer were mixed into the prepolymer.<br>
[00189]    The NCO concentration of the prepolymer was determined using the following titrimetric procedure in accordance with ASTM-D-2572-91.  The titrimetric method consisted of adding a 2 gram sample of Component A to an Erlenmeyer flask.  This sample was purged with nitrogen and several glass beads (5mm) were then added.  To this mixture was added 20 mL of 1N dibutylamine (in toluene) with a pipet. The mixture was swirled and capped.  The flask was then placed on a heating source and the flask was heated to slight reflux, held for 15 minutes at this temperature and then cooled to room temperature.  Note, a piece of Teflon was placed between the stopper and joint to prevent pressure buildup while heating.  During the heating cycle, the contents were frequently swirled in an attempt for complete solution and reaction.  Blank values were obtained and determined by the direct titration of 20 mL of pipeted 1N dibutylamine (DBA) plus 50 mL of methanol with 1N hydrochloric acid (HCI) using the Titrino 751 dynamic autotitrator.  Once the average values for the HCI normalities and DBA blanks were calculated, the values were programmed into the autotitrator.  After the sample had cooled, the contents were transferred into a beaker with approximately 50-60 mL of methanol.  A magnetic stirring bar was added and the sample titrated with 1N HCl using the preprogrammed Titrino 751 autotitrator.  The percent NCO and IEW (isocyanate equivalent weight) were calculated automatically in accordance with the following formulas: [00190]    %NCO=(mLs blank-mLs sample)(Normality HCl)(4.2018)/sample wt., grams<br>
[00191]    IEW=(sample wt., grams)1000/(mLs blank-mLs sample)(Normality HCI).<br>
[00192]    The "Normality HCI" value was determined as follows. To a pre-weighed beaker was added 0.4 grams of Na2C03 primary standard and the weight was recorded.  To this was added 50 mL of deionized water and the Na2C03 was dissolved with magnetic<br>
stirring.  An autotitrator (i.e., Metrohm GPD Titrino 751 dynamic autotitrator with 50 mL buret) equipped with a combination pH electrode (i.e., Metrohm combination glass electrode No. 6.0222.100), was used to titrate the primary standard with the IN HC1 and the volume was recorded.  This procedure was repeated two additional times for a total of three titrations and the average was used as the normality according to the following formula: [00193]    Normality HCl=standard wt., grams/(mLs HC1)(0.053)<br>

Desmodur W was obtained from Bayer Corporation and represents 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) containing 20% of the trans, trans isomer and 80% of the cis,cis and cis, trans isomers.  Pluronic L62D is a polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide block polyether diol and was obtained from BASF.  The reaction mixture was heated to a temperature of 65°C at which point 30 ppm of dibutyltindilaurate catalyst, from Aldrich, was added and theat was removed. The resulting exotherm raised the temperature of the mixture to 112°C. The reaction was then allowed to cool to a temperature of about 100°C, and 131 grams of UV absorber Cyasorb 5411 (obtained from American Cyanamid/Cytec) and 32.66 grams of Irganox 1010 (obtained from Ciba Geigy) were added with 0.98 grams of one weight percent solution of Exalite Blue 78-13 (obtained from Exciton).
