The order of mixing the phenol represented by the formula (1), the haloalcohol represented by the formula (2), the water-immiscible organic solvent, the aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution and the phase-transfer catalyst is not specifically limited.  For example, these materials may be mixed all at once and stirred to react.  Alternatively, to an aqueous mixture solution of the phenol and the aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution may be added dropwise a mixture solution of the haloalcohol and the water-immiscible organic solvent.  An aqueous mixture solution of the phenol and the aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution can be also added dropwise to a mixture solution of the haloalcohol and the water-immiscible organic solvent.<br>

 <br>
From Liie viewpoint or a reaction rate, the reaction is preferably performed within the range of 50°C to 100°C. The reaction time is usually about 10 hours to about 20 hours.  Progress of the reaction can be monitored by analyzing the residual amount of the phenol represented by the formula (1) using gas chromatography or liquid chromatography.<br>
After the end of the reaction, a reaction mixture is usually allowed to stand and separated to give an oil layer containing the intended product, the alcohol compound represented by the formula (3).  The oil layer can be washed with water.  The oil layer also can be neutralized with acidic water such as aqueous sulfuric acid, separated, and washed with water again.<br>
After washing, for example, the obtained oil layer can be concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the organic solvent to give a concentrate of the alcohol compound represented by the formula (3).  The concentrate can be further subjected to general purification such as silica gel column chromatography, crystallization and recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
As described above, the intended alcohol compound represented by the formula (3] can be produced efficiently in good yield.  Examples of the compound represented by the formula (3) include the following compounds.<br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be further described in more detail with reference to Example, which the present invention is not limited to. Example 1<br>
A mixture of 1.15 g of 3-bromopropanol, 7.5 g of toluene and 0.12 g of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide was heated to 60°C, and thereto was added a slurry solution of 1.5 g of 4-(benzyloxy)phenol, 7.5 g of water and 1.22 g of a 27% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution with stirring.<br>
 <br>
After addition, the mixture was stirred at 60°C for 17 hours.  In this period, 0.40 g of 3-bromopropanol and 0.40 g of a 27% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were further added thereto at the time point of 13 hours.  Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to 20°C.  After 3.0 g of a 2 0% aqueous sulfuric acid solution and 15.0 g of toluene were added thereto, the mixture was stirred and then separated.  The obtained organic layer was washed with 7.5 g of a 1% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution once and with 7.5 g of water once, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 2.0 g of 3-(4-benzyloxy)phenoxy)-1-propyl alcohol (purity: 93%,  yield: 94%).<br>
