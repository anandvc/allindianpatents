"A STABLE HOMOGENEOUS MOTOR    FUEL COMPOSITION FOR STANDARD<br>
DIESEL, GAS-TURBINE AND JET ENGINES AND A METHOD THEREOF"	"<br>
AGROFUEL AB,   a  Swedish  company,   of P  O   Box  30192,   S-104   25 Stockholm, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
16 SEP 2005<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a stable homogeneous motor fuel composition for standard diesel, gas-turbine and jet engines and a method thereof.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to motor fuel, for diesel, gas-turbine, and turbojet engines, and especially for standard engines, which motor fuel includes fuel compositions of organic compounds containing bound oxygen, and, optionally, also hydrocarbon compounds. Additionally, this invention relates to motor fuel for such engines, and especially diesel engines, in which the fuel composition constitutes a stable, homogeneous liquid at a pressure and an ambient temperature, being normal operational conditions of said engines.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The problem of the reduction of pollutants in the exhaust emissions of diesel-driven engines is a challenge to modem society. It is proposed to replace diesel oil as a fuel for vehicles, as represented by, for example, EN 590 and No. 2 diesel oil, and the like, because of environmental reasons and also due to its effects on health. There are international agreements providing for the progressive tightening of the requirements concerning the amount of toxic products resulting from the combustion of motor fuel in the exhaust emissions of vehicles and other machines using diesel engines. In the European Union countries and in the USA the requirements of Step II come into force starting from year 2002. The requirements stipulate significant decreases of carbon monoxide (CO), mixtures of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (HC+NOx), and particles in the exhaust emissions of diesel engines.<br>
Moreover, modern society is preoccupied with the damage to the global balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is linked to the intensive burning of petroleum products, coal and fossil gas. The damage to the carbon dioxide balance in the atmosphere causes global climate warming and has a negative influence on the nature of our planet.<br><br>
In this connection the development of motor fuel for engines obtained from renewable plant resources is of real significance.<br>
The growing concern for the protection of the environment and for stricter standards in the content of harmful components in exhaust emissions forces industry to develop urgently various alternative fuels which burn more cleanly.<br>
The existing global inventory of vehicles and machinery with standard diesel, gas-turbine and turbojet engines does not currently allow the complete elimination of, as a motor fuel, hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from mineral resources, such as from crude oil, coal and natural gas, an example of such a hydrocarbon mixture being diesel oil.<br>
On the other hand it is possible to replace a portion of hydrocarbons in motor fuel, such as diesel oil, with other organic compounds which provide cleaner emission exhaust and do not adversely affect engine performance. Gasolines comprising oxygen-containing compounds are presently widely used. It is also known, for instance, that the replacement in motor fuel of 15% of the diesel oil by alcohol provides cleaner exhaust and provides acceptable power without modification of existing diesel engines.<br>
However, the problem of using the most widely available and inexpensive alcohols, methanol and ethanol, as a portion of a motor fuel is that these compounds are immiscible with diesel and gasoil fuels. Potentially, alcohols and other oxygen containing compounds should yield environmentally clean products of combustion. However, the combustion process in engines is an extremely complicated phenomenon, which is affected not only by the composition of the fuel, but also by the physical parameters of the fuel, and, initially by the homogeneity of the liquid.<br>
The feasibility and properties of mixtures of petroleum diesel fraction with ethanol was reported long ago, such as in Technical Feasibility of Diesohol, ASAE Paper 79-1052, 1979. It was stressed in that article that the main problem of the use of such a fuel is its tendency for phase separation. Furthermore, such phase separation is significantly affected by the presence of water in the system. At 0°C a water content<br><br>
of only 0.05% causes separation of motor fuel consisting of 99% diesel and 0.95% ethanol.<br>
It is widely known that NOx emission can be reduced by' reducing the combustion temperature.- One way of achieving reduced combustion temperature is by adding water to the fuel or separately injecting water in the combustion chamber.<br>
However, by adding water phase separation will occur in most fuel systems, especially at lower temperatures, i.e., e.g. below 0°C. EP-A-0 014 992 (BASF) and US Patent 4,356,001 (to W. M. Sweeney) addresses the problem of water in the fuel composition by including in the fuel polyethers and/or acetals with or without methanol or ethanol. However, when formulating fuel compositions according to the patent one will find that the improved water tolerances are not sufficient in a wider temperature range. The emissions of CO, hydrocarbons and soot from such fuels are remarkably higher than acceptable.<br>
It is known that alcohol-containing fuels provide relatively low emissions of carbon, carbon oxide and nitrogen oxide (Johnson R.T., Stoffer J.O., Soc. Automot. Eng. (Spec. Publ.) 1983, S.P. 542, 91-104).<br><br>
A significant part of the developments in the field of hybrid diesel fuels is dedicated to the creation of microemulsions. Microemulsions are thermally stable colloid dispersions in which the particle diameter is on the order of 20-30 A. In 1977 Backer proposed employing surfactants to form microemulsions of alcohols and hydrocarbons (GB Patent No. 2,002,400, granted July 12, 1977). Later, for the same purposes other emulgators were proposed (GB Patent No. 2,115,002, granted February 1, 1982; U.S. Patent No. 4,509,950, issued March 24, 1985; U.S. Patent No. 4,451,265, issued April 21, 1984; and European Patent No. 475,620, published March 18, 1992.<br>
It is possible to achieve a homogeneous composition of diesel fuel incorporating different alcohols and their mixtures. In the French Patent No. 2453210 published October 31, 1980, in order to achieve a homogeneous liquid incorporating Hydrocarbons and methanol, it is proposed to add also primary aliphatic saturated alcohols of linear and branched structures having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms or" mixtures of such alcohols. The avoidance of the separation of the hybrid fuel<br><br>
   incorporating the alcohol mixture allows the development covered by the European Patent No. 319060, published June 7, 1989.<br>
The study of the performance characteristics of the hybrid fuels confirms the possibility of their use for the operation of diesel engines (Mathur H.B., Babu M.K. Indian Inst. Techn. Joum. Therm. Eng., 1988, 2(3), p. 63-72. Haschimoto, K., et al., Journ. Jap. Petrol. Inst, 1996, v. 39, N2, p. 166-169).<br>
 In 0.95/02-§544p.ublished January 26, 1995), in order to achieve a homogeneous __fuel blend the patentees propose using a formulation containing up to 20% of the total volume of ethanol and/or n-propanol, up to 15% of the total volume of fatty acid and/or organic ester, and the remainder a hydrocarbon liquid. The patent provides examples of compositions in which oleic acid as well as different organic esters are used in addition to diesel, ethanol and propanol.<br>
In accordance with W095/02654 all the Examples are said to illustrate fuel compositions having a single phase. This is said to demonstrate the effectiveness of using certain amounts of fatty acids and/or organic esters, as well as their mixtures, in order to obtain homogeneous liquids incorporating diesel and low alkyl alcohols in addition to those mentioned above. However, the patent does not any state temperature limits of stability of the obtained fuel formulations, and is silent as to how the presence of any water affects their stability. On the other hand, it is known that stability of mixtures of lower alcohols and diesel is one of the main operational properties of such fuels; It is stated in W095/02654 that tests of several compositions in various standard diesel engines did not show a decrease of power and efficiency of the fuel. However, nothing is said regarding the content of the exhaust emissions of different engines using the fuel formulations proposed. The only comment in that regard is that the use of the ethanol blend over several months in the engine of a Yale Fbrklift (model GDP 050 RUAS) Mazda XA was likely to be more acceptable with regard to the condition of the air inside the warehouse where the forklift was operated.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The drawbacks mentioned of the fuel compositions of the prior art is eliminated by providing a fuel composition of the present invention including oxygen-containing<br><br>
  compounds exhibiting at least four oxygen-containing functional groups, selected from alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, ether,, ester, inorganic ester, acetal, epoxide (also referred to as oxirane), and peroxide groups, wherein said at least four groups can be contributed to by any combination of two or more different oxygen-containing compounds, each of which contains at least one of said groups and, optionally, hydrocarbon compounds.<br>
The composition thus obtained will form a homogeneous liquid fuel tolerant to the presence of water over a wide range of temperatures. Employing the inventive motor fuel as a replacement of a ordinary motor fuel for operating a standard engine demonstrates considerable reduction of pollutants in the exhaust emissions, including emissions of NOx, and particles. Moreover, the use of components obtained from renewable raw material reduces emission into the atmosphere of the excess carbon dioxide.<br>
According to the invention a fuel is provided that can be used in existing, standard engines, including diesel engines, advantageously without any changes in fuel injection synchronisation, valve timing and valve opening time. It is thus possible to switch between conventional fuels and fuels according to the present invention without any engine modification. Such a property is of great practical value.<br>
Contrary to a large number of fuel compositions of the prior art which have been<br>
used to replace diesel fuel in part or totally, especially such compositions<br>
containing carboxylic acids, the fuel of the present invention is essentially non-<br>
corrosive.	.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that, due to the flexibility of the composition of the fuel, it is possible to adapt the same so as to take advantage of the current prices at a given time of the specific constituents, or even replace any constituents in order to produce a cheaper fuel, if desired. It is, for example, possible to let the price and availability of any hydrocarbons used govern the contents of the fuel compositions.<br>
Most advantageously, the method of preparing the fuel of the present invention does not require any vigorous mixing of the constituents, such as in the prior art.<br><br>
Thus, no intensive stirring of the mixture is required in order to obtain a homogeneous fuel composition of the present invention.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention a homogeneous fuel composition providing efficient operation of diesel, gas-turbine and turbojet engines, including standard engines and reduced emission of pollutants in the exhaust emission is obtained by employing oxygen-containing compounds comprising at least four oxygen-containing functional groups, wherein said groups can be contributed to by any combination of two or more different oxygen-containing compounds, each of which contains at least one of said groups, preferably by employing at least four types of organic compounds differing in functional groups containing bound oxygen.<br>
This invention is based, inter alia, on employing as a motor fuel the above-mentioned combination of organic compounds containing bound oxygen, with or without hydrocarbons, forming a homogeneous liquid at ambient temperature and ordinary pressure in the environment wherein the engine is operated. When used as a motor fuel the above-mentioned combination of the organic compounds containing bound oxygen, and optionally, hydrocarbons, provides the required operational characteristics of said engines, and a surprisingly reduced amount of pollutants in the exhaust emissions.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that, if brought to temperatures below the cloud point or to temperatures above the starting boiling point, so that a phase separation will occur, the inventive fuel compositions subsequently, when allowed to return to temperatures within the temperature range between the cloud point and the initial boiling point of the specific fuel composition, will re-homogenise.<br>
In one aspect of the invention a motor fuel comprises at least four different oxygen-containing functional groups contained in any number of organic compounds, wherein the oxygen can be bound in any of the following functional groups:<br><br><br>
 , optionally, hydrocarbon compounds.<br>
 In another embodiment of the invention a motor fuel composition for diesel, tubojet and jet engines, including standard engines, has reduced emission of pollutants and comprises an oxygen-containing organic component containing at least one compound of each of at least four of an alcohol, an aldehyde, a ketone, an ether, an ester, an inorganic ester, an acetal, an epoxide, and peroxide, and, optionally a hydrocarbon component.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, the oxygen-containing organic compound component is present in amounts from about 5% to 100% based on the total volume of the. motor fuel composition and, when present, the hydrocarbon component is employed in amounts from 0 to about 95%, based.on the total volume of the motor fuel composition.<br>
In general, the motor fuel composition is preferably stable at atmospheric pressure over a temperature range from a cloud temperature of as low as about -35°C to an initial boiling temperature of about 180°C.<br>
The preferred homogeneous motor fuel composition has a cloud point not higher than about -50°C and an initial boiling point not lower than about 50°C.<br>
The motor fuel composition preferably exhibits at least one, more preferably a<br>
portion, and, most preferably, all of the following properties:<br>
(i)      density at 20°C of not less than 0.775 g/cm3;<br>
(ii)     the cloud temperature is not higher than 0°C at atmospheric pressure;<br>
(iii)    stable at atmospheric pressure from cloud temperature of 0°C to initial boiling<br>
point of 50°C;<br>
(iv)     amounts of liquid evaporated by boiling at<br>
atmospheric pressure;<br>
-	not more than 25% of the total volume of the motor fuel composition distills no higher than 100°C;<br>
-	not more than 35% of the total volume of the motor fuel composition distills at temperatures no higher than 150°C;<br><br>
-	not more than 50% of the total volume of the motor fuel composition distills at temperatures no higher, than 200°C;<br>
-	not less than 98% of the total volume of the motor fuel composition distills at temperatures no higher than 400 °C, suitably no higher than 370°C; and preferably no higher than 280°C;<br>
(v)      heat of combusion on oxidation by oxygen of not less than 39 MJ/kg;<br>
(vi)     self-ignition temperature from 150°C to 300°C.<br>
(vii)    ability to accommodate at least 1% water by volume.<br>
The motor fuel composition is preferably produced by successively introducing into a fuel reservoir at the same temperature, the components of the motor fuel composition beginning with the component having the least density at that temperature and terminating with the component having the highest density at that temperature.<br>
A heavier hydrocarbon fraction is typically employed in combination with the oxygen-containing components. The hydrocarbon fraction employed is generally any hydrocarbon mixture, such as a petroleum fraction, meeting ASTM specifications for diesel fuel. Depending on grade, actual hydrocarbon fractions will vary. No. 2 diesel fuel, having its European counterpart in EN 590 diesel fuel, is most commonly used in commercial and agricultural vehicles and increasingly, in private vehicles. Of course other hydrocarbon fractions lighter than the diesel fraction, including kerosene, as well as fractions heavier than the diesel fraction, including gas oil and fuel oil, could be used in the present motor fuel, to replace the diesel fraction.<br>
I<br>
The hydrocarbon component of the instant motor fuel composition, when employed, is preferably a'diesel fraction. The diesel fraction is preferably a mixture of a diesel oil and the hydrocarbon fraction lighter than the diesel oil. It is also possible to employ a hydrocarbon liquid obtained from a renewable raw material as a component of the motor fuel for diesel engines. It is preferred to employ the hydrocarbon liquids obtained from turpentine or rosin, as well as hydrocarbon liquids produced by processing of oxygen containing compounds.<br>
The hydrocarbon component of the motor fuel for diesel engines, when employed, can be produced from synthesis-gas, or natural gas and coal.<br><br>
Preferably, at least one of methanol or ethanol, and, optionally, products derived i from said methanol and/or ethanol, are present in the oxygen-containing<br>
compound component. The components of the motor fuel may contain<br>
contaminants, which reduce the time and expense in processing the components<br>
for use in the fuel.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention amounts in the order of 1% water based on the total volume of the motor fuel composition may be present without significantly undesirably affecting the properties and homogeneity of the motor fuel compositions. Accordingly, components and hydrocarbon fractions commercially available containing water need not necessarily be treated to remove water prior to incorporation in the motor fuel.<br>
It is also a preferred feature of the invention that the oxygen containing organic compound component is employed from a renewable plant resource.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, for a fuel composition providing a shorter period of delay in the ignition of the motor fuel, the organic compounds containing bound oxygen preferably have a linear or sparsely branched molecular structure.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, for a fuel composition containing organic compounds containing bound oxygen with a branched molecular structure in order that the efficiency of operation is not reduced, the temperature of self-igriition of the motor fuel composition is between about 150°C and 300°C.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the invention a fuel composition is provided for efficient operation of engines and exhibiting reduction of pollutants in the exhaust emissions, without the addition of hydrocarbons. For this purpose, only the organic compounds containing bound oxygen are employed.<br>
The instant motor fuel composition can be utilised under conditions of either reduced and/or increased ambient temperature with satisfactory efficiency in operation.<br><br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the invention an oxygen '   containing components provide the required lubrication properties of the motor fuel, which is of particular importance for proper operation of diesel engine.<br>
According-to another preferred embodiment of the invention an oxygen containing components provide reduction of deposit in the combustion chamber of the engine.<br>
The oxygen-containing component of the motor fuel of the invention preferably includes (i) alcohols, (ii) ethers, (iii) organic esters and (iv) at least one of aldehyde, ketone, inorganic ester, acetal, epoxide, and peroxide.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the fuel composition of the invention comprises at least one compound of each of the different classes included in (i) to (iv) above.<br>
Mixtures of alcohols, such as (i) ethanol and butanol, (ii) ethanol, propanal and hexanol, (iii) methanol and ethanol, (iv) ethanol, butanol and hexanol and (v) ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, ethyl-hexanol, and trimethylnonanole and the like may preferably be employed as the alcohol component. Further, mixtures of ethers, and mixtures of organic esters may also be utilised for the ethers or organic ester component, respectively, with satisfactory results. Likewise, mixtures of any of each of acetais, epoxides, peroxides, aldehydes, ketones and inorganic esters may be employed for such components.<br>
When three or fewer different classes of oxygen-containing components are employed to form the instant motor fuel composition for diesel engines it has been found that it is difficult to readily form a homogeneous, single phase fuel. For example, when diesel oil is combined with ethanol, oleic acid and isopropyl oleate as in Composition 10 of W095/02654 by adding to diesel oil ethanol, oleic acid and isopropyl oleate, and the mixture is permitted to stand for an hour, a multi-phase composition is generally observed. Only with substantial shaking does the phase separation disappear. To the contrary, in the present invention where four different classes of oxygen-containing compounds are employed and the components are mixed in order of increasing density and the mixture allowed to stand for at least about an hour, a single phase mixture is obtained without the need for external mixing.<br><br>
The oxygen-containing compound can include an alcohol. In general, aliphatic alcohols, preferably alkanols, and mixtures thereof are employed. More preferably, alkanols of the general formula: R-OH, in which R is alkyl with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as ethanol, n-, iso- or sec-butyl, or amyl alcohol, 2-ethylhexanol, or 2,6,8-trimethyI-4-nonanole are employed.<br>
The fuel additive can include an aldehyde of the general formula where R is<br>
a Ci-Cs. hydrocarbon.<br>
, Preferred aldehydes include formaldehyde, ethylaldehyde, butylaldehyde, isobutylaldehyde and ethylhexylaldehyde.<br>
The fuel additive can include a ketone of the general formula <br>
wherein R and Ri each are a C1 - C8 hydrocarbon residue, the same or different or, together, form a cyclic ring, the total number of carbon atoms of R and Ri being 3 to 12. The preferred ketones of the invention include diisobutyl ketone, ethylamyl ketone, carvon, and menthone.<br>
The ether fuel additive preferably includes, a monoether, a diether and/or a cycloether. A preferred ether has the general formula R-O-R', wherein R and R' are the same or different and are each a C2-C10 hydrocarbon group or, together, form a cyclic ring. In general, lower (C4-C8,) dialkyl ethers are preferred.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in the ether is preferably from 8 to. 16.<br>
Typical monoethers include dibutyl ether, tert-butyl isobutyl ether, ethylbutyl ether, diisoamyl ether, dihexyl ether and diisooctyl ether. Typical diethers include dimethoxy propane and diethoxy propane. Typical cycloethers include cyclic mono, di.'and heterocyclic ethers as dioxane, methyl tetrahydrofuran, methyl tetrahydropyran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.<br>
The ester additive may be an ester of an organic acid of the general formula<br>

boiling temperature).<br>
An analysis of the amount of pollutants in the exhaust emission from the standard diesel engine of the VW Passat TDI 1.9 automobile, model 1997, Engine Family 2D1-WDE-95, power kW/rpm = 81/4150 according to the Test Type - Modified European Driving Cycle (NEDC UDC + EUDC) ECE OICA (91/44.1 /EEC) for Motor Fuel Composition 21, showed in comparison to 100% Mkl diesel fuel (SS 15 54 35), a reduction in the amounts of CO (g/km) of 25%; HC+NOx (g/km) of 3.5% and particles (g/km) of 30%.<br>
Similar results were obtained when employing the Motor Fuel Composition 21 for operation of the standard airplane turbojet engine.<br><br>
i Examples 4, 5, 8, and 11 demonstrate the possibility of producing the motor fuels for diesel engines using petroleum kerosene fraction, which fuels can also be used for jet engines. Moreover, examples 5, 8 and 15 demonstrate that the fuel of the invention comprising particular hydrocarbon component remains stable under temperatures down to minus 70°C: This property is not demonstrated by any of the fuel formulations revealed by the prior art.<br>
Examples 4, 10, and 11 demonstrate that the present invention enables mixing over extremely wide range of concentrations of organic compounds containing bound oxygen and of a hydrocarbon liquid, wherein no engine modification is required.<br>
Examples 7 and 11 demonstrate the possibility of using hydrocarbons yielded in mineral coal processing as a hydrocarbon component of the motor fuel.<br>
Examples 8 and 9 demonstrate the possibility of using methanol and ethanol as a raw material for oxygen-containing compounds required for producing of the novel motor fuel of this invention. Both methanol and ethanol are largely produced in many countries of the world, meaning the novel fuel of this invention has a good raw material situation. Production of the majority of the organic compounds containing bound oxygen needed for production of the fuel of this invention exists in industrial scale. That means that production of the motor fuel of this invention is feasible and can be started up within short period of time.<br>
Examples 10 and 11 demonstrate the possibility of using for producing of a motor fuel an organic compound containing bound oxygen, which compound is not thoroughly purified and may contain by-products. It simplifies the production technology and makes those compounds cheaper and more accessible.<br>
Examples 12 and 13 demonstrate the possibility of formulating the novel motor fuel stable over wide temperature range from -36°C to +184°C. It should be stressed, that even when brought to reduced or increased beyond the limits temperature, so that phase separation occurs, the fuel of this invention will again form a single, stable and homogeneous phase after it has been allowed to return to temperatures within limits of -36°C and +184°C between the cloud point and starting boiling<br><br>
point. The examples demonstrate also that the fuels have a high flash point, which  makes these fuels safer and simpler in transportation, handling and distribution.<br>
Examples 5, 8, 14 and 15 demonstrate the possibility of formulating of the novel motor fuel operating at ambient temperatures below 0°C. Moreover, the hydrocarbon fraction obtained in processing of gaseous C2-C5 hydrocarbons can be used for production of the motor fuel of this invention.<br>
Examples 16 and 17 demonstrate the possibility to produce the novel motor fuel being tolerant of presence of water. Water content up to 1% vol. does not affect stability of the fuel even at temperatures as low as -36°C. This is extremely important feature of this invention. The prior art does not reveal such a fuel. The motor fuel of this invention does not require for its production thoroughly dehydrated oxygen-containing compounds, making production cheaper and simpler. Moreover, example 17 demonstrates the possibility to employ hydrocarbons yielded in processing of vegetation as a fuel component. The latter feature enables formulating the motor fuel formed entirely by renewable components.<br>
Examples 18, 19 and 20 demonstrate the possibility to produce the novel motor fuel for standard engines comprising oxygen-containing compounds only, without using any of hydrocarbons. Such a fuel was never revealed before. Even specially designed ethanol fuel engines require certain content of hydrocarbons in the fuel to improve ignition.<br>
Examples 21-^8 demonstratesinter alia that the requested combination of four functional groups can by achieved by employing, for example, two compounds.<br>
Other variations of the invention are included as will be clear to those of ordinary skill in this art, such as, for example, to use only three compounds. The invention is not to be limited except as set forth in the following claims:<br><br>
