				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cosmetic hair care composition and a process for preparing such composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Till the present time, alopecia i.e. baldness is considered as a hair problem in human beings. In spite of much scientific research in the field of cosmetics, there has been no solution to the problem of baldness in human beings or animals. Baldness as such is not a disease which could cause pathological conditions in the mammalian body such as human body. In other words, baldness is not a pathological condition. However, baldness spoils the appearance of the face of a human being.<br>
Causes of baldness :<br>
There are several reasons for the occurrence of baldness on mammalian skin or human scalp. A few of the reasons being, (I) it is a hereditary problem inherited from the parents. It is presumed that there are a few genes responsible for the baldness and such genes are 'expressed predominantly in males. Though, these genes are dormant in females, nevertheless as carriers of such genes they can pass such genes to the male off springs without showing any occurrence of baldness on themselves; (ii) the extreme weather conditions such as desert area or presence of certain chemicals such as chlorine or calcium in the water used for washing hair; (iii) hypertension; (iv) reaction to drug such as chemotherapy; (v) hormonal disturbances; (vi) menopause and its accompanying disturbance; and (vii) glandular disturbances and abnormal thyroid functioning.<br>
Normally, the part of the scalp where hair grows is known as hair follicle. Due to several reasons, the size of the hair follicle shrinks to the extent that it does not allow the hair to grow. When this process of follicle shrinkage persists for a long time then the problem of baldness begins . Beneath each hair follicle, there are certain types of cells where hair begins life. These cells are directly involved in manufacturing and controlling the growth of hair shaft. When these cells become inoperative/inactive/dead, then the peison faces the problem of baldness.<br>
The appearance, growth and fall of hair is a continuous process. Usually, the life of hair is between 3 to 4 years. A person loses between 50 to 150 hairs per day and new shoots come out of these follicles. Due to such continuous process, old hairs fall down after a stipulated period, these hairs are replaced by new hairs . As stated earlier, once the size of the hair follicle shrinks to the extent as explained above and cells lying undetneath become inoperative .and old locks of hair which have already fallen off are not replaced by new growth, then the problem of baldness begins.<br>
Scientists all over the world are busy finding a solution to solve the problem of baldness in human being but till date ao one has achieved a clear  break through in this field. This view is also supported by British Science News No.249, Page 19 "Spectrum" Nov-Dec.1995<br>
PRIOR ART DISCUSSION<br>
Some years ago, scientists in the USA developed an anti-hypertension medicine comprising 2% minoxidal. While administrating this drug to the patients of hypertension, the doctors surprisingly noticed that such administration triggered<br>
hair growth in the body of the patients. Many patients noticed the growth of cosmetically accepted hair on their bodies. Unfortunately, the treatment of minoxidal was accompanied by several side effects. Further, the application of minoxidal on the scalp also triggered growth of facial hair. In addition, the process of growth of hair on the bald scalp was co-terminus with the process of application of minoxidal. . In other words, once the application of minoxidal is slopped, the hair also stops growing or falling off. Further, the growth of hair on the bald scalp was not satisfactory and complete. Therefore, the above application could not mitigate the problem of baldness.<br>
There are several hair treating compositions or. oils proposed by different companies or groups but none has given authenticated proof regarding the efficacy of the products.<br>
There are many methods by which the bald scalp can be covered with either artificial or natural hair and a few of such methods are listed herebelow: a. Hair transplant: This treatment involves obtaining tuffs of hair from different parts of the body and transplanting them on the bald scalp. The tuffs of hairs thus transplanted on the bald scalp start growing and thereby cover the bald scalp to a certain extent. However, this treatment is not a solution to the problem of baldness because it is very costly and creates ugly lumps or accumulation of flesh on and around the hair tuffs oil the scalp. Moreover, this treatment is a painful one and only a.limited number of hairs can be transplanted on the bald scalp. In addition, after the transplant, the scalp requires to be properly conditioned or protected from undue exertion or weather conditions.<br>
b.	Hair weaving: It is simply a means of concealing baldness. It is also costly<br>
and does not give permanent solution to baldness because it has no connection or<br>
relationship with the roots or its cells which are the foundation of hairs.<br>
c.	Wig.: It is a device made of artificial or natural hair having one or more<br>
fixing means whereby the wig can be superficially fixed on the bald scalp. This<br>
does not provide a permanent solution and at the same time it is most inconvenient<br>
for the wearer.<br>
d.	Injection of some hormones: This treatment is painful and does not<br>
provide pennanent cure for baldness. In addition, the hormones injected create<br>
many unwarranted side-effects.<br>
e.	Providing cuts on the scalp;<br>
f.	Local application of razor several times on the scalp to induce growth of<br>
new hair;<br>
g.	Local application of kerosene oil;<br>
h.       Local application of powdered elephant tusk (ivory);<br>
i.	Local application ofc fish oil;<br>
j.        Local application of coconut oil;<br>
k.        Local application of onion extract;<br>
I.        Local application of tincher/sulphur on the scalp;<br>
The various factors of the body relating to cure of baldness depend on :<br>
The number of years a person has been bald or has been suffered from loss of hair.<br>
The extent of baldness in the scalp of the person<br>
The age and general health conditions of the person..<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of an intensive research based herbal medicine, the applicant ESCUBE LABORATORIES Dehra Dun - 248 001, India has now come out with a novel composition for hair care on mammalian skin preferably, on human skin, wherever the hair follicles are present.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a novel composition for application on hair present on mammalian skin such as a human being.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel cosmetic herbal hair care composition, said composition comprising Emblica offinicalis 9 to 35 wt%, Terminal Chebala 3-15 wt.%, Sapindus mukorossi 8-30 wt%, Acacia concinna 15-45 wt%, Nardostachye sp. 5-20 wt%, Ecupta Alba 10-35 wt%, and optionally 2-25% of conventional additives such as preservatives and/or flovouring agents and/or rose water.<br>
The novel composition of the present invention is a synergistic composition exhibiting surprising properties. In other words, the unique property of the composition has not been envisaged in any of the individual ingredients of the composition. The composition is a herbal cosmetic preparation. The inference of applying the novel composition establishes that it has the unique distinction of being an authentic and effective solution for maintaining and caring hair. This composition helps in setting (hair setting) the hair. Further, the dark colour of the composition, upon application on hair, provides a sort of block dying effect to the hair. This composition is also provides shine to the hair. This composition is not an anti bacterial agent.<br>
The present composition includes the following ingredients :<br>
100 ml of the novel composition comprising of Emblica offinicalis - 9 to 35 wt% Terminal Chebala - 3-15 wt% Sapindus mukorossi - 8-30 wt%<br>
Acacia concinna -15-45 wt%<br>
Nardostachye sp - 5-20 wt%<br>
Ecupta Alba - 10-35 wt%<br>
Preferably 6.5 ml of the novel composition comprising of<br>
Emblica officinalis 1.1% to .925%<br>
Terminal Chehola .425% to .325%<br>
Sapindus mukorossi 1.25% to .950%<br>
Acacia carcinna 1.95% to 1.35%<br>
Nardostachuys Sp. .975% to .45%<br>
Ecupta Alba 1.75% to 1.15%<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to a process for preparing a novel cosmetic herbal composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 3, said process comprising the steps of obtaining and mixing in any known manner extracts of plants namely Emblica offinicalis, Terminal Chebala, Sapindus mukorossi, Acacia concinna, Nardostachye sp., Eclipta alba, and optionally 2-25% of conventional additives such as preservatives and/or flavouring agents.<br>
The composition.includes sat lobhan (intense) as a preservative and it can range from 2 to 25% of the composition. In addition, the composition also contain conventional additives such as roe water, preservatives, colouring agents and flavouring agents.<br>
Steps of preparation:<br>
The novel composition can be prepared by mixing the ingredients identified above with water in any known manner. Preferably, the herbs identified above can be reduced into power and the power so obtained mixed with soft or distilled water and the essence of the herbs is obtained by filtration. Any part of the plants can be used for preparing the herbal extracts.<br>
Most preferred manner of producing the composition :<br>
Preferably, there can be "ghan satva" of each of the six ingredients, preferably, 1 gm each of the ingredients mixed with 1§ times of soft water and left in sunlight under glass or in shadow for 3 days. Theft it is boiled till the soft water remains upto 4 to 2 times more in the mixture. It is filtered and mixed with original power<br>
of ingredient and such mixture is kept fox some time so that power will absorb the excess water. This process is repeated several times. At last, the original power of ingredients does not absorb it even after it is left for some time. Then it is called "ghan satva".<br>
Later, the "ghan satva" of each ingredient mixed together and also with 9 times soft water with total amount of all ingredients. It is left in this form for 4 days. Thereafter, it is boiled 2 hours per day for 2 days. After that it is filtered and boiled till it achieves a great density that water. Subsequently, it is allowed to be cooled down. Finally, optional ingredients are mixed and the novel composition is ready for use.<br>
Properties of the present hair treating composition :<br>
It checks the falling of two types of alopefia i.e. baldness.<br>
(i)      Alopecia androgenetica - Hereditary hair loss - genetic problem<br>
(ii)     Alopecia areata in either of the forms - (i) patchy and (ii) total<br>
The present Composition is preferably massaged at the scalp with tips of the fingers and the scalp may be washed with warm water at least one hour after massaging the scalp with the composition.<br>
The first sign of regrowth of hair is the growth of so called "downy hair" (i.e. thin hair without pigmentation and short in leagth). This is gradually replaced by the hair of user's colour and structure.<br>
The applicant found many advantages in using the above composition and a few of such advantages are given hereunder:<br>
It is 100% herbal product;<br>
It does not contain alcohol/astroid;<br>
It is a natural product offering natural hair regrowth;<br>
It is hormone free;<br>
It is a permanent solution and does not require life long application;<br>
It does not produce growth of hair in unwanted places;<br>
No side effects or adverse reactions on the body.<br>
The analysis of the novel composition also shows that it includes vitamins such as vitamins B, B5, C and D and minerals such as iron which give life to the hair and strengthen the roots of the hair.<br>
Vitamin 135 increases the length of the hair and Vitamins B3 and B4 make the hair soft and shiny.<br>
The present novel composition also impaits softness to the hair. To certain extent, the present composition checks premature greying of hair and generates the melanin, a natural substance providing colour to hair.<br>
To remove the bone of contention regarding the growth of new hair, photograph of the scalp will have to be taken before use of the composition. After use of (local application) the novel compostion for some time, further photograph of the scalp will have to be taken. From the subsequent photograph, it can be noticed that initial growth of hair takes place along the margins of bald spots. This result can be identified by comparing the phetographs/slides of scalp before and after use of the novel composition.<br>
An amount of 100ml of the composition may be used between 15 to 20 days depending upon the density of the hair already present.<br>
In addition, the present composition can be used to remove dandruff, prevent falling and premature graying of hair. It also increases the length of the hair and checks splitting of hair at its tip. It also provides complete nourishment to the hair.<br>
It is equally effective on both the sexes and has shown its efficacy in respect of all strata of the society.<br>
It has also shown its efficacy in different climatic conditions in different parts of the world.<br>
The present composition is for external use only and it has been used with 90% success without any side -effects or adverse reactions.<br>
Even after stoppage of application of the present novel composition, the hair still appears soft, shiny and nice. Further, the hair continues to grow even after the application of the composition has slapped. The application of the composition can be at least once a day and the new hair may start appearing on the scalp after a month's time.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings :<br>
The drawings annexed herewith are photographs showing different stages of growth of hair on human scalps and face. From these figures, it is quite apparent that the synergistic composition is an effective solution for solving the problem of hair loss or for regeneration of hair. The inventor has given details of a few human models herebelow in the accompanying drawings and in these drawings:<br>
Figs. l(a.), (b) and (c) show  a male scalp before application of the composition,<br>
after application for a month and after application for 3 months, respectively.<br>
Figs.2(a), (b) and (c) show the front view of a male scalp where the present<br>
composition is applied at various stages.<br>
Figs.3(a) and (b) show the rear view of the male scalp before and after the<br>
application of the composition for about 45 days, respectively.<br>
Figs.4(a) and (b) show the top view of a female scalp before and after the<br>
application of the composition for about 2 months, respectively.<br>
Figs.5(a) and (b) show the top view of another female scalp before use of the<br>
composition and after use of the composition for about 40 days, respectively.<br>
Figs.6(a) and (b) show the growth of facial hairs (beard) on a male human before<br>
use of the composition and after use of the composition for   about 40 days,<br>
respectively.<br>
The present composition stimulate growth of hair on any mammalian skin where the hair follicles are present . If the hair follicles are present in the skin then the growth of hair may not be achieved by the use of the composition.<br>
Fig. 1(a) shows the scalp a person before application of the composition. The<br>
composition was regularly applied for about a month and Fig. 1(b) was taken.<br>
Application of the composition was continued for another 2 months and Fig. 1(c)<br>
was taken. Comparison of these figures clearly indicate the growth of additional<br>
hair on the scalp of the person.	Likewise, Fig.2(a) was taken before the<br>
application of the composition on a person. This person applied the composition<br>
as per the instructions given above far about 17 days and the second photograph<br>
was taken as Fig.2(b). The application was continued for another one month and<br>
Fig.2(c) was taken.	To establish the effectiveness of the composition,<br>
photographs of the scalp of the same person were taken before and after use of the<br>
composition for about 17 days and shown here as Figs.3(a) and (b). The Figs.2 and 3 clearly establish the growth of additional hairs on the scalp once the composition was started applying on the scalp.<br>
The same composition was tried on a female scalp and efficacy of the composition was tested. Fig.4(a) really shows the scantiness of hair on a female scalp before use and once the composition was used for about 2 months fresh hairs started growing which is quite apparent from Fig.4(b) of the accompanying draings. The present compositon was also tried on another female human being to establish the fact that the present compositon triggers growth of hairs on inactive follicles on the scalp. Fig.5(a) was taken before use of the composition and Fig.5(b) was taken after the use of the composition for about one and half months. The present composition not only activates the hair follicles present in the scalp but also regenerates or activates hair follicles present in the other parts of the skin. To estabilish this fact, the present compositon was applied on the chin of a boy for about 40 days and growth of beard was observed. Fig. 6(a) depicts the side view of the face of the boy before employing the composition and Fig. 6(b) clearly shows the growth of the beard on the face after about 40 days of application.<br>
The above description clearly establishes the fact that the composition is very effective in providing growth of hair on mammalian skin where hair follicles are present. Yet another feature of the present composition is that it is effective even to diabetic patients and such patients get hair growth as if like normal human beings. The present composition is a synergistic composition and the properties identified in the present composition are not present or identified in the individual components. In other words, the composition exhibits unexpected or surprising properties. The composition of the present invention is effective on all mammalian skin. This invention does not relate to like category of "medicine or drug." The composition is not used for treating any diseases and it is purely cosmetic in nature.<br><br><br><br><br>
