FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to communication systems, and more<br>
specifically to a method and apparatus for detecting cloned communication units.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
One problem that operators and users of communications systems and<br>
particularly wireless communication systems often need to address is that of security<br>
or privacy for communications on these systems. This problem may be particularly<br>
pronounced in systems that provide service to a multitude of users via<br>
communications units, such as cellular phones. One technique used by miscreants to<br>
monitor another's communication includes using a cloned communication unit or<br>
phone, where a cloned unit is configured to duplicate all identification characteristics,<br>
such as identification/serial numbers of a legitimate/authorized phone.<br>
Many such systems and standards that define such systems include provisions<br>
for authorizing and authenticating communication units that utilize the services. For<br>
example the cellular system defined by the well known IS-2000 standards specifies<br>
procedures for authentication, however these procedures and the requisite equipment<br>
can be a financial burden for a system operator and typically add latency to obtaining<br>
or acquiring services, e.g. while the phone is being authenticated, etc.<br>
Clearly a need exists for cost effective approaches for detecting cloned<br>
communication units.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In overview, the present disclosure concerns communications systems that<br>
provide service to communications units or more specifically user thereof operating<br>
therein. More particularly various inventive concepts and principles embodied in<br>
methods and apparatus for the detection or discovery of cloned or duplicated<br>
communication units are discussed. The communications systems of particular<br>
interest are those being deployed such as cdma2000 spread spectrum systems<br>
although the principles and concepts can have application in many other wide area or<br>
local area systems where differences between a cloned and unauthorized versus<br>
authorized communication unit can be detected or discovered based on differences<br>
between signals that are provided by such units.<br>
As further discussed below various inventive principles and combinations<br>
thereof are advantageously employed to detect or discover a cloned or duplicated<br>
communication unit based on expected or resultant impacts on inbound signals that<br>
can result from such units, thus alleviating various problems associated with cloned<br>
communication units, such as the monitoring of legitimate communications with<br>
authorized communication units. This is accomplished in a cost effective low latency<br>
manner provided these principles or equivalents thereof are utilized. The disclosed<br>
approaches can be used in conjunction with other authentication or authorization<br>
techniques and equipment and still yield a low latency approach, at least until a<br>
possible cloned unit is detected thereby causing a more thorough authentication<br>
process, etc. to be utilized.<br><br>
The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the<br>
best modes of making and using various embodiments in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and<br>
appreciation for the inventive principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in<br>
any manner the invention. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims<br>
including any amendments made during the pendency of this application and all<br>
equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as first and<br>
second, top and bottom, and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another<br>
entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship<br>
or order between such entities or actions.<br>
Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles are<br>
best implemented with or in software programs or instructions and integrated circuits<br>
(ICs) such as general purpose processors or application specific ICs. It is expected<br>
that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design<br>
choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic<br>
considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be<br>
readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs and ICs with<br>
minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of<br>
any risk of obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention,<br>
further discussion of such software and ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials<br>
with respect to the principles and concepts of the preferred embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a simplified and representative block diagram of a<br>
communications system 101 suitable for using various embodiments of a cloned<br><br>
communication unit detection method and apparatus will be described and discussed.<br>
The FIG. 1 exemplary communication system 101 is generally known and depicts a<br>
base station 103 that is intercoupled to a mobile switching center 105 along with other<br>
base stations 109. The mobile switching center 105 is arranged to inter couple<br>
communications from or to the appropriate base stations and a public switched<br>
network, such as a public switched telephone network 107. The base stations operate<br>
to support an air interface with a multitude of communication units, where base station 103 is shown with a radio link or air interface to two communication units 111,<br>
113. Note that actual communication systems may be significantly more complex and<br>
include various additional known entities, such as base site controllers, billing,<br>
authorization, authentication, and voice mail servers that are not germane to the<br>
present discussions and thus for the sake of simplicity have not been depicted.<br>
Unfortunately, one of these communication units, such as unit 111 can be an<br>
unauthorized communication unit, such as a cloned version of communication unit<br>
113. Cloned or duplicated communication units are one means or approach that may<br>
be used for unauthorized monitoring of another communication or other mischief.<br>
Normally this is illegal, however it may be necessary to take additional measures to<br>
preclude such activities. A cloned communication unit normally refers to a unit that<br>
assumes the identity of another and authorized communication unit. Thus the cloned<br>
communication unit, for example will have the same ESN (electronic serial number)<br>
and/or MIN (mobile ID number or mobile phone number). Therefore, whenever one<br>
or both of these numbers are used directly or in a derivative form to convey identity<br>
between the communication system or portion thereof and the communication unit,<br>
both units are likely to send or receive the same information. In order to detect such<br><br>
cloned communication units and overcome the resultant problems, the communication<br>
system is advantageously modified in accordance with the inventive principles and<br>
concepts discussed below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a simplified and representative block diagram of a base<br>
station suitable for use in the communications system of FIG. 1 will be described and<br>
discussed. The base station implements and utilizes a data processing system 209 for<br>
detecting cloned communication units. The base station is coupled to an antenna 203<br>
via a transceiver 205. Typically a base station will have a plurality of such<br>
transceivers however the relevant operation of one is sufficient to explain the<br>
principles and concepts according to the present invention. The transceiver is known<br>
and can vary with the access technology but operates as a receiver and transmitter for<br>
receiving and transmitting radio signals via the antenna 203 to communications units,<br>
such as units 111,113, within a respective coverage area.<br>
The transceiver is coupled to an input/output 207 of a data processing system<br>
209 and the system is further coupled to the balance of a radio access network at 211,<br>
such as base station controllers, mobile switching centers and the like. The data<br>
processing system 209 includes a processor 213 coupled to a memory 215. The data<br>
processing system 209 can comprise various functionality including other signal<br>
processing duties pursuant to supporting an air interface with communication units or<br>
base station controlling duties as will be appreciated in the field. The processor 213<br>
can be comprised of one or more general purpose processors or digital signal<br>
processors and application specific integrated circuits with a processing core, etc all<br>
of which are generally available and will be known to one of ordinary skill. The<br><br>
memory is also known and can be comprised of various combination of random<br>
access memory, read only memory, magnetic memory and so forth.<br>
The memory is used to store various operating subroutines or software<br>
instructions, variables, and data. When the processor executes the appropriate<br>
routines the data processing system 209 will operate to control and support the base<br>
station and detect or discover cloned or duplicated communication units as further<br>
described below. The various routines include as generally depicted an operating<br>
system, variables, and data routine 217 that provides the overall structure and<br>
functionality. Further included are various air interface routines 219 that can vary<br>
with the access technology and specific architecture of the base station and<br>
communication system but that generally support functions for an air interface, such<br>
as channel coding, modulation, transmitter control, receiver control, demodulation,<br>
call processing and the like as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill.<br>
Other routines include a frame rate decision and power control group selection<br>
routine 221 for use in variable rate modulation systems, such as for example<br>
cdma2000 systems. Further, a parameter, such as power level, quality, or interference<br>
level measurement routine 223 is shown. Another routine is a comparison routine 225<br>
for comparing the assessed or measured parameters to a threshold or other<br>
corresponding parameter. Then a routine 227 provides an indication of a cloned<br>
communication unit under appropriate circumstances, where the indication may be<br>
used to deny or discontinue service, send appropriate service messages to the unit(s)<br>
or other communication system entities in a system management role or other wise<br>
initiate appropriate action. Further depicted is a portion of memory 229 for storing<br>
thresholds and these may depend on various circumstances, such as the particular<br><br>
parameter that is being measured, frame rate decision, system preferences, and so<br>
forth. An additional database 231 comprises mobile station or communication unit<br>
identifying information, such as ESNs, MINs, etc. that are used to coordinate<br>
communications with particular units. Various other routines 233, such as user and<br>
service interface, alarms and the like routines, possibly other applications that will be<br>
appreciated by one of ordinary skill but not here relevant are normally also included.<br>
In this embodiment the data processing system 209 is depicted as and co-<br>
located with the base station 103 and represents incremental processing duties for the<br>
processing and control functions of the base station. Note that it may be appropriate<br>
to locate this data processing function at other locations or points within the<br>
communication system. Other locations, such as a base site controller or the MSC<br>
105 could offer an advantage of a centralized point for this processing for several or<br>
all of the base stations, however there could be a tradeoff with the added resource<br>
costs of transporting the underlying information and any incremental latency resulting<br>
from such transport.<br>
In operation the data processing system 209 is operable to detect or for<br>
detecting cloned (duplicated, unauthorized) communication units in a communication<br>
system, such as a cdma2000 system. The data processing system 209 comprises the<br>
input, such as input 207 that is coupled to a sequence of data symbols corresponding<br>
to a signal that was received, for example by the transceiver 205, and a processor 213<br>
that is coupled to the input and operable to determine whether the signal originated<br>
from a plurality of communication units, such as units 111, 113 based on a first<br>
parameter of a first group of the data symbols. In one embodiment the processor is<br>
further operable to compare the first parameter to a threshold, using for example<br><br>
routine 225, and when the threshold is satisfied, e.g. threshold is exceeded or<br>
parameter falls below the threshold depending on the parameter and so forth, provide<br>
an indication that the signal originated from the plurality of communication units, thus<br>
suggesting that one or more of the plurality of communication units is a cloned unit.<br>
The processor is further operable, using the routine(s) 223, to measure or<br>
assess the first parameter, for example, a first power level of the first group of the data<br>
symbols, compare the first power level to a power threshold from the memory<br>
location 229, and when the power threshold is satisfied provide the indication that the<br>
signal originated from the plurality of communication units. Alternatively or<br>
additionally the processor is further operable to assess, measure, or determine a first<br>
quality level, for example an interference level or signal to noise or interference level,<br>
of the first group of the data symbols using the routine(s) 223, compare the first<br>
quality level to a quality threshold, and when the quality threshold is satisfied provide<br>
the indication that the signal originated from the plurality of communication units.<br>
Alternatively, the data processing system 209, specifically the processor 213<br>
can operate to measure, determine, or assess the first parameter of the first group of<br>
the data symbols and measure or assess a second parameter of a second group of the<br>
data symbols and provide the indication that the signal originated from the plurality of<br>
communication units based on a comparison of the first parameter and the second<br>
parameter. For example, the processor can be operable to assess or measure a first<br>
power level of the first group of the data symbols and assess a second power level of<br>
the second group of the data symbols and provide the indication that the signal<br>
originated from the plurality of communication units based on a comparison of the<br>
first power level and the second power level.<br><br>
In other embodiments, the data processing system 209, specifically processor<br>
213 will operate to assess a first quality level of the first group of the data symbols<br>
and assess a second quality level of the second group of the data symbols and provide<br>
the indication that the signal originated from the plurality of communication units<br>
based on a comparison of the first quality level and the second quality level. When<br>
the comparison of the first and second parameters is made typically a difference will<br>
be formed and this difference is then compared to an expected difference and if the<br>
difference is larger than expected or possibly smaller depending on the parameter that<br>
is measured it is determined that multiple units are responsible for or originated the<br>
signal. The measurements and the like use the routine(s) 223, comparisons use the<br>
routine(s) 225, the thresholds or information sufficient to determine the thresholds is<br>
located at 229.<br>
The data processing system 209 can be advantageously used in a base station<br>
for detecting unauthorized communication units in a communication system that is<br>
using a code division multiple access air interface protocol, such as the protocol<br>
defined by the cdma2000 standards promulgated by the 3GPP task force as will be<br>
discussed in relevant part below with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a simplified form of an arrangement of data symbols in<br>
one communication protocol that can be utilized to facilitate detection of duplicated<br>
communication units will be described and discussed. FIG. 3 depicts various<br>
arrangements of data or code symbols for a reverse or uplink (mobile to base) CDMA<br>
traffic or payload channel using variable data rate transmission for certain radio<br>
configurations. This Figure is based on Figure 2.1.3.1.9.1-1, page 2-115, of the<br>
Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems (3GPP2 C.S0002;<br><br>
version 3.0; version date June 15,2001, available through the 3RD Generation<br>
Partnership Project 2 entity). The example described below applies to radio<br>
configuration 1, where this radio configuration refers to one of several configurations<br>
specified by the above referenced standard. Note that the concepts and principles<br>
described and discussed can apply to other radio arrangements. Generally "Radio<br>
Configurations" describe modulation and coding schemes for the radio interface. For<br>
example, Radio Configurations 1 (RC1) and 2 (RC2) share the same modulation<br>
schemes, but different channel coding strategies. As is known, RC1 has more error<br>
correction/detection bits available than RC2; RC2 does a "puncturing" scheme on it's<br>
coded data to convert its data stream to the same symbol rate as RC1, which<br>
effectively reduces the number of error correction/detection bits available in RC2 (and<br>
lowers it's channel coding gain).<br>
FIG. 3 shows the general structure of a frame of data 303 on the reverse<br>
channel, where this frame is 20 milliseconds (ms) in duration and comprises 16 power<br>
control groups (numbered 0 to 15 as shown) 305 with each power control group being<br>
1.25 ms in length or duration. Each power control group comprises 6 modulation<br>
symbols with each modulation symbol denoting 6 code symbols. Thus one 20 ms<br>
frame can include up to 576 code symbols or 96 modulation symbols if all power<br>
control groups contain data. The variable data rate is accomplished by using different<br>
frame arrangements according to the amount of data that a communication unit has to<br>
send over the uplink channel, e.g. the desired data rate for a frame. Note also that the<br>
depicted frame results after normal receiver processing including de-spreading<br>
according to the spreading codes for a particular communication unit, demodulation,<br>
and so forth.<br><br>
The data frame 309 shows a full rate data frame where all 16 power control<br>
groups can contain data. In this example, the full rate frame is used for 9600 or 14400<br>
bit per second (bps) frames. The data frame 311 depicts a half rate or ½ rate data<br>
frame where only eight of the sixteen power control groups can contain data as shown<br>
by the pattern 312. The ½ rate frame is used for 4800 or 7200 bps frames. The data<br>
frame 313 shows a quarter rate or ¼ rate data frame where only 4 of the 16 power<br>
control groups can contain data as shown by the pattern 314. The ¼ rate frame is<br>
used for 2400 and 3600 bps frames. The data frame 315 shows an eighth or 1/8th rate<br>
data frame where only 2 of the 16 power control groups can contain data as shown by<br>
the pattern 316. The 1/8th rate frame is used for 1200 or 1800 bps frames.<br>
The particular patterns shown 312, 314, 316 are exemplary only and derived<br>
according to a Data Burst Randomizing Algorithm as specified at 2.1.3.1.9.2 in the<br>
above identified standard for suitable communication unit or radio configurations (e.g.<br>
1 and 2 in the language of the standard). The data burst randomizing algorithm<br>
generates a masking pattern of '0's and ' 1 's that randomly masks out redundant data<br>
that is generated by known code repetition. The masking pattern is determined by the<br>
data rate of the frame and by a block of 14 bits taken from the long code<br>
corresponding to the communication unit. The long code mask is generated from the<br>
communication unit's electronic serial number. These 14 bits can be the last 14 bits<br>
319 of the long code used for spreading in the next to last power control group, e.g.<br>
14, of the previous frame 317. In other words, these are the 14 bits, which occur<br>
exactly one power control group (1.25 ms) before each Reverse Fundamental Channel<br>
frame boundary as depicted. These 14 bits are denoted as b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6,<br>
b7, b8, b9, b10, M1, b12, b13, as shown at 321, where b0 represents the oldest bit,<br><br>
and bl3 represents the latest bit. Note that in order to randomize the position of the<br>
data bursts, shown by patterns 312, 314, 316, only 8 bits are strictly necessary. The<br>
algorithm described here uses 14 bits to ensure that the slots used for data<br>
transmission at the quarter rate are a subset of the slots used at the half rate and that<br>
the slots used at the one-eighth rate are a subset of the slots used at the quarter rate.<br>
The data burst randomizing algorithm is defined as follows:<br>
If the Data Rate Selected is a full data rate, e.g. 9600 or 14400 bps;<br>
transmission will occur on power control groups 0,1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,<br>
13, 14,15.<br>
If the Data Rate Selected is half rate, e.g. 4800 or 7200 bps; transmission shall<br>
occur on power control groups numbered b0, 2 + b1, 4 + b2, 6 + b3, 8 + b4,10 + b5,<br>
12 + b6,14 + b7.<br>
If the Data Rate Selected is ½ rate, e.g. 2400 or 3600 bps; transmission shall<br>
occur on power control groups numbered b0 if b8 ='0', or 2 +b1 if b8 = '1'; 4 + b2 if<br>
b9 = '0', or 6 + b3 if b9 = '1'; 8 + b4 if b10 = '0', or 10 + b5 if b10 = ' 1'; and 12 + b6<br>
if b11 = '0',or 14 + b7 if b11 = '1'.<br>
If the Data Rate Selected is 1/8th rate, e.g. 1200 or 1800 bps; transmission shall<br>
occur on power control groups numbered bO if (b8, b12) = ('0', '0'), or 2 + b1 if (b8,<br>
b12) = ('1', '0'), or 4 + b2 if (b9, b12) = ('0', '1'), or 6 + b3 if (b9, b12) = ('1', '1');<br>
and on 8 + b4 if (b10, bl3) = ('0', '0'), or 10 + b5 if (b10, b13) = ('1', '0'), or 12 + b6<br>
if (b11, b13) = ('0', '1'), or 14 + b7 if (b11,b13) = ('1', '1').<br>
The exemplary patterns 312, 314, 316 are derived or generated by using b0-<br>
b13 = 00101101100100 and applying the above randomizing algorithm.<br><br>
A brief explanation of how an authorized communication unit will operate in<br>
terms of the FIG. 3 data arrangement as contrasted with a cloned communication unit<br>
will help with understanding the concepts and principles according to the present<br>
invention. The authorized unit once assigned to the reverse traffic channel will select<br>
a data rate dependent on the present voice or data activity at the authorized<br>
communication unit. If there is no activity, e.g. silence, the authorized unit will be<br>
muted and the 1/8th rate frame will be selected in accordance with the applicable<br>
cdma2000 vocoder standard. The cloned unit will always be muted in order to<br>
monitor the communication and avoid being otherwise detected on the channel.<br>
Given the vocoder standard, that means the cloned or duplicated unit will transmit<br>
null information in the power control groups according to the appropriate pattern for<br>
the 1/8th rate frame. An example of this 1/8th rate frame transmission is described in<br>
section 4.6 of the 3GPP2 Enhanced Variable Rate Codec standard, C.S0014-0.<br>
Since as noted above the power control groups containing data for the 1/8th<br>
rate frames are always a subset of power control groups with data for the ¼, ½, and<br>
full rate frames one of two situations will occur. If the authorized unit is sending<br>
information, the power control groups or null groups sent at an 1/8th rate from the<br>
cloned communication unit will interfere with the corresponding power control<br>
groups from the authorized communication unit and lower quality or higher<br>
interference will be observed in the 1/8th rate power control groups when compared to<br>
other power control groups. Alternatively, if both communication units are muted,<br>
e.g. silent, then the power control groups for the 1/8th rate frame will contain the same<br>
information, e.g. null frames, and thus to an observer at the base station that is<br><br>
receiving the composite signal comprised of coherently added symbols abnormally<br>
high power levels will be observed.<br>
Thus by observing or measuring a power level of the 1/8th rate power control<br>
groups or data symbols corresponding thereto or alternatively a power level of the<br>
other power control groups relative to the 1/8th rate power control groups an<br>
assessment of whether a cloned communication unit is present can be made.<br>
Similarly, by observing quality levels or interference levels or relative quality or<br>
interference levels for 1/8th rate power control groups versus other power control<br>
groups a reasonable indication of whether a cloned communication unit is present can<br>
be made. It is also apparent that the degree of interference or relative interference or<br>
change in power levels that will be observed can be a function of the data rate that is<br>
selected or used by the authorized communication unit. For example if a ¼ rate is<br>
used then two of the four power control groups will be interfered with whereas if a<br>
full rate frame is used then 2 of 16 will be interfered with. Thus the threshold that is<br>
selected will depend on the parameter that is measured or assessed as well as chosen<br>
frame rate for the authorized communication unit. One of ordinary skill can<br>
determine an appropriate threshold either by derivation or experimentation keeping in<br>
mind the relative costs of an error in either direction. Note also that these differences<br>
in power and interference or quality levels will likely be observed over a multitude of<br>
frames and thus a final decision that a cloned unit is present can be based on multiple<br>
observations over many frames.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a flow chart illustrating a method embodiment of<br>
detecting cloned communication units will be described and discussed. The method<br>
of FIG. 4 can be performed or practiced by the apparatus or data processing system<br><br>
209 of FIG. 2 or other apparatus with similar functionality or capability. The FIG. 4<br>
flow chart illustrates a method of detecting duplicated or cloned communication units<br>
and begins at 401. At 403 a signal is received, where the signal, for example<br>
comprises a sequence of data symbols and these symbols can be arranged according<br>
to the diagram of FIG.3. Then at 405 it is determined whether the signal originated<br>
from a plurality of communication units, e.g. an authorized and cloned<br>
communication unit, based on a parameter, such as power or quality or interference<br>
level, of a group of the data symbols. If a cloned communication unit is indicated<br>
then 407 shows denying or discontinuing service for the particular communication<br>
unit (ESN, MIN, etc.) and if desired sending, for example a text message indicating<br>
that maintenance or service for the unit is required or some similar message and then<br>
the method ends at 409. The method will be repeated periodically or at each new<br>
traffic channel assignment or as otherwise desired by the system operator.<br>
In more detail the determining whether the signal originated from the plurality<br>
of communication units at 405 can comprise additional processes and these processes<br>
may vary according to the arrangement of the air interface protocol. Generally, the<br>
additional processes amount to selecting an appropriate portion of the received signal<br>
or symbol and comparing some parameter of this portion to some expected value for<br>
that parameter to make a decision that a cloned communication unit is present. In<br>
variable data rate systems, a process of making a frame rate determination or decision<br>
as at 411 can be useful. Then at 413 selecting one or more groups of data symbols<br>
where these groups can depend on the frame rate as noted above in the discussion of<br>
FIG. 3. Given the relevant groups of data symbols, e.g. power control groups in FIG.<br>
3, the parameter, such as a power level or quality level of the group(s) or portion of<br><br>
the group(s) is then assessed or measured at 415. Next at 417 comparing the first<br>
parameter to a threshold is undertaken and when the threshold is satisfied, 419 decides<br>
that the signal originated from the plurality of communication units, e.g. a cloned unit<br>
is operating. If the threshold is not satisfied the method ends at 409 and if the<br>
threshold is satisfied the processes at 419,407 are performed.<br>
Thus the determining whether the signal originated from the plurality of<br>
communication units can further comprise assessing a power level of the first group<br>
of the data symbols at 415, comparing the power level to a power threshold at 417,<br>
and when the power threshold is satisfied deciding that the signal originated from the<br>
plurality of communication units at 419. For example if the determined frame rate is <br>
1/8th rate and the relevant power control groups from 1/8th rate frames exceed the<br>
expected power level by 3-6 dB it is likely that a cloned unit exists and is contributing<br>
to the measured power in these power control groups.<br>
In another embodiment, the determining whether the signal originated from<br>
the plurality of communication units at 405 can further comprise assessing a quality<br>
level of the first group of the data symbols at 415, comparing the first quality level to<br>
a quality threshold at 417, and when the quality threshold is satisfied deciding that the<br>
signal originated from the plurality of communication units at 419. For example, if<br>
the determined frame rate is other that 1/8th rate and the quality level or interference<br>
level for the 1/8th rate power control groups is markedly lower than the target level or<br>
expected or observed rate for other power control groups it is likely that a cloned<br>
communication unit exists and is interfering with the 1/8th rate power control groups.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the determining whether the signal originated<br>
from the plurality of communication units can comprise assessing or measuring the<br><br>
first parameter (power or quality level) of the first group of the data symbols and<br>
assessing a second parameter (power or quality level) of a second group of the data<br>
symbols at 415 and deciding that the signal originated from the plurality of<br>
communication units based on a comparison of the first parameter and the second<br>
parameter at 417, 419. For example, if the determined frame rate at 411 is other than<br>
1/8* rate, then at 413 the first group of the data symbols could be selected to be the<br>
relevant power control groups, other than the 1/8th rate power control groups and the<br>
second group the 1/8 rate power control groups. An average power level for the <br>
1/8th rate frames would be expected to vary from (typically exceed based on non-<br>
coherent addition) the average power level for the other power control groups and this<br>
would be an indication that a cloned or duplicated communication unit was present.<br>
Thus a comparison of the first power level and the second power level could be used<br>
to base a decision regarding cloned unit presence. Similarly an assessment of quality<br>
levels between these two groups could be used, where it is expected that the quality<br>
level would be lower for 1/8th rate power control groups than other power control<br>
groups if a cloned communication unit is present and adding interference to these<br>
power control groups. Thus a comparison of the first quality level and the second<br>
quality level would indicate the presence of a cloned unit.<br>
The method of FIG.4 may be advantageously used in a base station for<br>
detecting unauthorized communication units in a communication system using a code<br>
division multiple access air interface protocol, such as cdma2000. Given a CDMA<br>
protocol, known techniques for measuring power levels and quality levels (noise or<br>
interference levels are ordinarily already in place as such measurements are typically<br>
used in order to implement power control in these systems. These existing techniques<br><br>
may require modification in order to properly measure or assess the proper groups of<br>
data symbols; however this will be within the skill set of the ordinary skilled artisan.<br>
Also note that any access technology (time division multiple access or frequency<br>
division multiple access or combinations for example) that uses variable data rates<br>
such that authorized and cloned communication units can be distinguished based on<br>
differences in data transmission characteristics is a candidate for using the principles<br>
and concepts disclosed herein.<br>
In particular, the method illustrated in FIG. 4 can be used for detecting cloned<br>
communication units that are operating in a communication system using code<br>
division multiple access (CDMA) protocols, where the method is set in or being<br>
performed by a base station. At 403 the receiving a signal comprises receiving a<br>
sequence of data frames, each data frame comprising groups of data symbols, such as<br>
the power control groups referred to above as will be observed on an inbound CDMA<br>
channel. The determining whether the signal originated from a plurality of<br>
communication units at 405 can for example be based on a relative power level<br>
corresponding to the groups of data symbols. Note that the relative power level can<br>
correspond to signal power levels or interference power levels for differing groups of<br>
symbols. An interference level can correspond to signal power relative to noise<br>
power over one or more power control groups or one or more data frames. As the<br>
signal is received in a variable data rate system ordinarily selecting a data rate<br>
corresponding to the data frame according to known techniques is undertaken and the<br>
comparing the power levels, relative power levels, interference levels, etc will include<br>
comparing them to a threshold where the threshold can be a function of the data rate.<br><br>
Note also that the determining whether the signal originated from the plurality<br>
of communication units can be based on comparing a first interference level, etc.<br>
corresponding to a first frame with a first data rate with a second interference level<br>
corresponding to a second frame with a second data rate. E.g., the comparison can be<br>
between measurements of parameters across different frames. In the cdma2000<br>
system one of the data rates, for example from a cloned communication unit will be<br>
an 1/8th frame rate and the other or authorized communication unit data rate is a 1/n<br>
rate, with n equal to 1, 2, 4, or 8.<br>
Thus an apparatus and methodology has been disclosed and described that<br>
provides a low latency, low cost technique for detecting cloned communication units<br>
on an inbound channel. Various embodiments of methods, systems, and apparatus for<br>
detecting cloned or duplicated communication units so as to facilitate and provide for<br>
identification and service denial for such units in an efficient and timely manner have<br>
been discussed and described. It is expected that these embodiments or others in<br>
accordance with the present invention will have application to many wide area<br>
networks as well as wireless local area networks. The disclosure extends to the<br>
constituent elements or equipment comprising such systems and specifically the<br>
methods employed thereby and therein. Using the inventive principles and concepts<br>
disclosed herein advantageously allows or provides for low latency and low network<br>
overhead detection of cloned communications units or devices, which can be<br>
beneficial to users and service providers a like.<br>
This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various<br>
embodiments in accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true, intended,<br>
and fair scope and spirit thereof. The foregoing description is not intended to be<br><br>
exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications or<br>
variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiment(s) was chosen<br>
and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its<br>
practical application, and to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the<br>
invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the<br>
particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the<br>
scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims, as may be amended<br>
during the pendency of this application for patent, and all equivalents thereof, when<br>
interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally, and<br>
equitably entitled.<br><br>
