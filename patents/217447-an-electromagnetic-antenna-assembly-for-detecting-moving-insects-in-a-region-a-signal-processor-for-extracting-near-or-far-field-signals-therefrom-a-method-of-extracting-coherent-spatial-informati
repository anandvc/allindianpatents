				<td>AN ELECTROMAGNETIC ANTENNA ASSEMBLY FOR<br>
DETECTING MOVING INSECTS IN A REGION; A SIGNAL<br>
PROCESSOR FOR EXTRACTING NEAR OR FAR FIELD<br>
SIGNALS THEREFROM; A METHOD OF EXTRACTING<br>
COHERENT SPATIAL INFORMATION FROM SIGNALS<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic antenna assembly for<br>
detecting moving insects in a region; a signal processor for extracting near or far field<br>
signals therefrom; a method of extracting coherent spatial information from signals<br>
and in particular to an antenna wherein its field pattern can be controlled<br>
electronically to obtain information about the nature of insect infestation in materials.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Conventional imaging radar requires the control of transmitted and/or<br>
received wavefronts (beamforming). In particular, target detection systems<br>
as used in military and commercial applications require accurate beam<br>
steering of transmitted signals to detect.and identify targets.<br>
In an analogous application, detection of the presence of insects,<br>
such as termites, in a structure requires accurate signal transmission and<br>
processing. Australian Patent AU 693039 assigned to the present applicant,<br>
describes a system for detecting the presence of insects in a structure by<br>
transmitting a microwave signal into a wall. Any disturbances in the received<br>
signal are detected and processed to indicate the presence or otherwise of<br>
insects.<br>
The above system however, is not able to determine the number,<br>
species and activity of the insects. Control and processing of the field<br>
pattern of the antenna is required to accurately determine the presence,<br>
location and type of activity of insects.<br>
Typically, in most conventional applications, far field beam steering is<br>
performed. It is also possible to control the transmitted nearfield pattern of a<br>
transmit antenna. However, this is expensive and difficult to do, as it is<br>
necessary to control the magnitude and phase of the carrier signal to each<br>
transmitter array element. Typically PIN diode phase shifters and<br>
attenuators are used. Phase control and magnitude control is poor, even<br>
with three bits of phase control, which is already difficult to achieve.<br>
Illumination control of the transmitted near field pattern in general is<br>
ineffective when transmitting into an inhomogeneous structure such as a wall<br>
in a house.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a receiving antenna having a<br>
controlled field pattern, by digital beamforming of the receiver array signals.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide an antenna for use in<br>
detecting the presence, number and activity of insects in a structure in a<br>
microwave signal detection system.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In one form, although it need not be the only or indeed the broadest<br>
form, the invention resides in an antenna assembly comprising:<br>
an array of receiving elements that receive signals transmitted into a<br>
field of the array at least at one frequency;<br>
mixer means that combines the received signals with a reference<br>
signal to extract in-phase (1) and quadrature (Q) IF signals from the received<br>
signals, wherein, the I and Q signals are combined to form complex signal<br>
vectors;<br>
adjusting means that adjust phase and magnitude values of each of<br>
said complex signal vectors;<br>
summing means that sum the adjusted complex signal vectors; and<br>
processing means that spatially and temporally filter said summed<br>
complex signal vectors to detect changes in the field due to moving objects.<br>
Preferably the received signal is a microwave signal reflected from a<br>
target in the field.<br>
The microwave signal is preferably at a nominal frequency of 24 GHz.<br>
The microwave signal may be at a second nominal frequency of 61 GHz.<br>
The phase and magnitude values for adjusting the complex signal<br>
vectors to achieve beam steering, focusing and scanning can be computed<br>
adaptively or looked up from a fixed look up table.<br>
The processing means may include filter means for filtering said<br>
summed signal.<br>
The processing means may include amplification means for amplifying<br>
the summed complex signal, which may be filtered, by said filter means.<br>
In another form of the invention there is provided a system for detecting<br>
insects, insect numbers and their activity in a structure, the system<br>
comprising:<br>
signal generator means operatively coupled to a transmitter means to<br>
thereby transmit microwave signals at least at one frequency into a part of<br>
the structure;<br>
an array of receiving elements for receiving said microwave signals in<br>
a field of the array of receiving elements, at said at least one frequency; and<br>
processor means for processing and controlling the received field<br>
signal to provide an output signal indicating the presence, activity and<br>
numbers of insects.<br>

this specific situation.<br>
The applicant"s prior Australian patent, AU 693039 describes a<br>
system for detecting the presence of insects in a structure using microwave<br>
signals, which description is incorporated herein by reference. The present<br>
invention will be described briefly with reference to that system.<br>
Referring to FIG 1, there is shown a block diagram of a system 1 for<br>
detecting insects, such as termites as described in AU 693039. The system<br>
1 comprises a microwave assembly 2 that transmits a continuous wave (or<br>
pulsed) microwave signal at a frequency of 24.125 GHz. The signal may be<br>
modulated by modulator 3.<br>
Signals 4 are transmitted into region 5 to detect the presence or<br>
otherwise of termites or other insects. Reflected signals 6 are passed 7 to a<br>
processor 8 for signal processing. Commands and programming may be<br>
input to the processor from the (optional) keypad 9 or from various optional<br>
diagnostics 10. The output from the processor is displayed on a display 11.<br>
Referring to FIG 2, the elements of the microwave assembly 2 are<br>
shown in more detail. The assembly includes a signal generator 13 for<br>
generating the signal at 24.125 GHz at a primary output, PO. The primary<br>
output PO is connected to a receiver and transmitter unit 14, which is<br>
coupled to antenna 15. In use, the antenna is located closely adjacent or in<br>
abutting relationship with the region 5, which is most often a wall but may be<br>
another part of the structure.<br>
A secondary output SO of signal generator 13 provides a reference or<br>
Local Oscillator (LO) signal, Ref, to one input of a mixer 16. The other input<br>
of mixer 16 is connected to the receiver circuitry of the receiver/transmitter<br>
unit 14, from which a received signal Rs is provided.<br>
Mixer 16 combines reference signal Ref and received signal Rs to<br>
provide a combined signal Cs comprising a beat frequency component at the<br>
output of mixer 16.<br>
The signal is then filtered, amplified, digitised and processed in<br>
processor 8 and displayed on display 11 to indicate the presence of insects.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, there is shown a block diagram of a smart antenna<br>
data acquisition circuit 17 in accordance with the invention. In this<br>
embodiment, the data acquisition circuit 17 will be described having regard to<br>
the insect presence detection system 1 and the microwave assembly 2 in<br>
FIG 2. In the present embodiment, a transmit antenna (not shown) is<br>
coupled to a transmitter/receiver unit 14 and microwave signal generator 13.<br>
A receiver antenna 22 can be an array of sixteen elements (this<br>
number is chosen for illustrative purposes only) in planar configuration as<br>
shown schematically in FIG 4. Other transmitter configurations are possible.<br>
The line shows the distribution of the LO (Local Oscillator) to 32 mixer<br>
diodes. One of the diodes in each pair associated with the same antenna<br>
element is fed with a quarter wavelength delay. This is to provide an output<br>
Q channel. The other diode outputs the I channel. The antenna elements<br>
can be rectangular patches on microstrip. However, it should be noted that<br>
skilled in the art. In the present application for detecting insects in a wall, a<br>
planar antenna structure is easy to manoeuvre behind obstacles, such as<br>
cupboards, and covers a larger area than a single element.<br>
The receiver antenna 22 receives signals in each of the elements in<br>
the array at the transmitter/receiver unit 14. The received signal Rs is split<br>
and distributed by a first set of splitters 18. The splitters are conventional<br>
broadband Wilkinson power dividers, however, other types of signal<br>
distributors may also be used.<br>
A second set of power splitters 19 distributes a local oscillator signal<br>
to mixers 16a and 16b. The local oscillator drive to the Q mixer 16b is<br>
delayed by ¼ wavelength in a delay unit 21 with respect to the I mixer 16a.<br>
Other methods of generating a differential phase shift of 90 degrees, such as<br>
quadrature hybrids could be used.<br>
The received signal Rs is distributed (in phase) to mixers 16a and<br>
16b. Mixers 16a and 16b combine reference signal Ref from local oscillator<br>
20 in the signal generator 13, with received signal Rs to extract I and Q IF<br>
components of the received signal respectively (0.1-10Hz typically).<br>
In this arrangement, the received microwave frequencies at 24.125<br>
and 61 GHz are processed to extract the I and Q components. A Field Effect<br>
Transistor (FET) Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) is tuned to an output<br>
frequency between 12.0625GHz and 12.2GHz. A comb generator (harmonic<br>
generator) produces integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Then a<br>
second harmonic of 12.0625GHz (24.125GHz) and a fifth harmonic of<br>
12.2GHz (61GHz) are centred in the two ISM bands. The selection of the<br>
appropriate harmonics is performed by bandpass filters.<br>
These frequencies are chosen purely on the basis that they are in the<br>
ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) bands and as such permit unlicensed<br>
transmission. The principle of receiver beamforming described herein is not<br>
restricted to any particular frequency of operation. The principle applies for<br>
the near, intermediate and far fields of all the antennas and antenna arrays<br>
involved.<br>
A total of sixteen vector signals are extracted, representing I and Q<br>
components of the received signal from the sixteen elements of the receiver<br>
antenna array.<br>
The antenna data acquisition circuit 17 of the present invention<br>
provides complex vector signals containing temporal information about the<br>
reflections from a host material such as a wall and potential targets within,<br>
such as insects. Each complex vector signal further contains information on<br>
in-phase and quadrature information (coherent data) and spatial data, since<br>
there are sixteen spatial points in the near field pattern at which the signals<br>
are detected.<br>
The complex vector signals containing the above information can be<br>
processed to control the field pattern at a receiving antenna, in accordance<br>
with the invention. In the application to the pest presence detection system<br>
of FIG 1, the near field pattern of the receiver antenna is controlled and<br>
processed to detect the presence, activity, numbers and types of insects in a<br>
structure such as a wall.<br>
Referring now to FIG 5, there is shown a block diagram of a<br>
processing circuit 23 for processing the acquired complex vector signals to<br>
control and process the field pattern in accordance with the invention.<br>
The complex vector signals I and Q represent the real and imaginary<br>
components of the complex vector signals. The I and Q signals are pre-<br>
filtered and amplified by bandpass amplifiers 24 and 25 respectively. The<br>
filters are analog band pass filters, typically having a lower cut-off frequency<br>
of 0.1 Hz and an upper cut-off frequency of up to 100Hz. The purpose of<br>
these filters is to reduce aliasing and offsets in the digital processing. Any<br>
controlled filtering can be performed by the microcontroller using standard<br>
IIR, FIR or DFT/DCT algorithms.<br>
The filtered and amplified signals are digitised by an analog to digital<br>
converter 26. A processor means such as a microcontroller 27 receives the<br>
digitised signals and performs signal processing.<br>
The microcontroller 27 is programmed with an algorithm for<br>
processing the digitised complex vector signals to control the near field<br>
pattern of the receiver antenna 22. In one form, the microcontroller<br>
processes the signals to provide spherical beamforming of the near field<br>
pattern. The microcontroller performs the following steps:<br>
Signals from each mixer are converted, into polar form. A look up table<br>
(LUT) is generated from calibration for a test target, so it includes<br>
compensation for inaccuracies in the ¼ wavelength delay in the Q<br>
component and mixer imbalance including other static differential errors.<br>
The LUT is used to perform the Cartesian to Polar conversion and<br>
compensation for inaccuracies.<br>
2. The phase of each signal is modified according to a spherical wavefront<br>
emanating from a grid of likely sources (focus points) from within a<br>
reasonable target volume, for example an area of 100mm long, 100 mm<br>
wide by 10mm deep. The grid can be 5mm in length and width and 2mm<br>
in depth, making up 2000 points. The exact grid location and spacing is<br>
determined by the application, so that aliasing is avoided in the phase<br>
domain. Such aliasing can result in ambiguities and spurious target<br>
detection.<br>
3. The sixteen complex signals are summed coherently (complex or vector)<br>
for each focus point.<br>
The summed signal magnitude and phase distribution is analysed<br>
using spectral analysis such as Fourier Transform to spatially locate targets<br>
within the grid.<br>
The raw complex I and Q signals received by the antenna array<br>
contain errors due to imperfections in the antenna geometry, differences<br>
between array elements, electromagnetic coupling between elements,<br>
differences in the response characteristics of mixers, uneven amplitude and<br>
phase distribution of LO (reference), and other factors. These imperfections<br>
can be corrected by calibration on a "point" transmitting antenna. The<br>
corrected received signals can then be adjusted to steer and/or focus the<br>
array onto a specific target or scan through a large target volume to produce<br>
an image. Since most of the detection is likely to involve the presence of<br>
inhomogeneous, anisotropic materials such as timber, plasterboard, concrete<br>
etc, the field patterns are distorted by the material. In such cases, an<br>
additional calibration can be obtained by placing cooperative target or targets<br>
in accessible positions, such as behind the wall or in the wall cavity. Such<br>
cooperative targets may involve modulated scatterers, for easy target<br>
recognition and discrimination. Additionally, such cooperative targets can be<br>
designed to offer effective scattering cross-sections, commensurate with that<br>
of the insects being detected. Insects also present a fluctuating scattering<br>
cross-section because of relative movement of their body parts with respect<br>
to the electric and magnetic fields of the microwave signal.<br>
A correction example is described below with reference to FIG 6.<br>
Consider focusing a spherical wavefront on a point X in three-dimensional<br>
space (one of 2000 or so grid points). Array element B (say) is on the<br>
correct radius XB. Consider an array element A. Its distance from X is XA<br>
which is smaller than XB. The output of the mixer at A needs to be delayed<br>
by an amount equivalent to AC. The latter can be translated into a phase<br>
shift of (AC/?)x360 degrees. Say that the measured polar signal at A has the<br>
magnitude MA and phase ?A(degrees). Then the corrected phase is<br>
?A+(AC?,)x360. Similar corrections are performed for all array elements. The<br>
microprocessor performs this rotation of a complex number. A slight<br>
magnitude correction can also be performed to compensate for the 1/r2<br>
signal reduction with range, since the scattered signal from a point target<br>
propagates in a spherical wavefront.<br>
After all signals from all the array elements are corrected for these<br>
phase errors, the signals are converted back to Cartesian format. I signals<br>
are added together and Q signals are added together (coherently) and a total<br>
vector is computed, whose magnitude is M and phase is ?. The values of M<br>
are computed for each of the 2000 or so grid points and histogrammed. Any<br>
major peaks in such a histogram are likely to be due to point scatterers at the<br>
respective grid points.<br>
A main advantage of the method is that when focused on a target<br>
point, the signals from all the receiver antennas are summed in phase<br>
(coherently). The signals from all other targets have random phases and thus<br>
on average sum to zero. Currently, the single large aperture antenna<br>
produces a scrambled sum (Fresnel Integral) of all targets and spurious<br>
reflections. This applies to desirable targets as well, since RF energy takes<br>
different paths to arrive at the single mixer and hence every target suffers<br>
from mutual and self interference. The objective of the signal processing<br>
algorithm is to obtain the maximum amount of coherent spatial information<br>
about the targets and their spatial distribution.<br>
In one embodiment as applied to an insect presence detection<br>
system, the wavefront from the target (insect) is not likely to be truly<br>
spherical, mainly because of refraction at the material boundaries. Walls,<br>
including studs and noggins, can cause these refractions. Materials such as<br>
timber, concrete, plasterboard etc may be inhomogeneous and anisotropic<br>
and distort the wavefront in unknown and unpredictable ways.<br>
Once an estimate of target location is obtained, the phase front can<br>
be fine tuned to obtain a more accurate target location by using maximum<br>
entropy or fuzzy logic techniques, typically implemented using neural nets.<br>
Refraction is compensated by deliberate distortion of the phase front. A<br>
person skilled in the art would have readily available to them, various<br>
techniques in fuzzy logic.<br>
In one example, assume a local maximum is found for a spherical<br>
beamfront, with X as the grid point at the centre of the sphere. The<br>
beamfront can be deliberately perturbed from its spherical shape and the<br>
magnitude of the new, coherently summed signal is compared with its<br>
previous (unperturbed) value. If the perturbation has resulted in a larger<br>
signal, it is accepted and further adjustments are made. Otherwise, it is<br>
rejected and another (different) perturbation introduced. The rules on the<br>
choice of perturbations can be obtained from a neural net, with fuzzy logic, or<br>
by similar techniques, such as maximum entropy filtering.<br>
The number of local maxima indicates the number of scatterers and<br>
hence the number of insects. The magnitude of each peak indicates the size<br>
of each insect. These estimates can be refined by applying signal processing<br>
in the time domain (tracking). This reduces the number of false or stationary<br>
targets and the number of missed targets.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, a dynamic or close to real time version of<br>
the signal processing can be realised by splitting the time series from each<br>
mixer 16a, 16b into separate (overlapping or contiguous) segments (frames)<br>
and performing similar beamforming analysis on each frame. This can be<br>
followed by target tracking, using Hidden Markov chain processing. Hidden<br>
Markov tracking is achieved by obtaining overlapping FFT"s of the signal time<br>
series and assigning probabilities to causal relationships between frequency<br>
bins in adjacent FFT"s. Eventually deterministic signals are all that survive<br>
this process and the probabilities of tracking such events tend to 1.<br>
Other alternative models may be used for target tracking, such as a<br>
Kalman filter. The principles and operation of Kalman Filtering can be found<br>
in numerous publications including, "Estimation of tracking: Principles,<br>
techniques and software" by Bar-Shalom Yaakov; LiXiao-Rong, published by<br>
YBS publishing, (1993 by Artech House Inc).<br>
Performing a frequency sweep of the local oscillator during the<br>
measurement period can enhance the dynamic processing. Such a sweep<br>
can either be digital (stepped) or analogue (chirp). Either could be used to<br>
assist in range resolution and ambiguity resolution of the received near field<br>
pattern. The resulting signals can be analysed by Gabor or wavelet<br>
processing (Frequency-Time FT analysis). Further details of the operation<br>
and implementation of Gabor processing may be found in "Gabor<br>
representation and signal detection, Gabor analysis and algorithms: Theory<br>
and applications" by Friedlander, B.Department of Electrical and Computer<br>
Engineering, University of California, Davis, California: Zeira, A.Signal<br>
Processing Technology, Palo Alto, California, 1997, Page 353-380.<br>
In another form of the invention, microwave signals at 24 GHz and 61<br>
GHz are received and analysed to determine the type of target detected. A<br>
comparison of the two near filed patterns can be used to determine a species<br>
of insect, type and size. Spectral analysis such as a spatial Fourier transform<br>
may be performed to determine insect species.<br>
The "imaging" algorithm discussed in the above description assumes<br>
that the target is a point. In a realistic situation, the target has non-zero<br>
spatial dimensions and spatial structure. This results in magnitude and phase<br>
variations in the scattered wavefront. Magnitude effects arise because signals<br>
reflected from different partsof the target have different phases and cause<br>
constructive/destructive interference (diffraction pattern). A spatial (discrete)<br>
Fourier Transform of the signals from the receiver array can reveal key<br>
features of this diffraction pattern and thus, an estimate of the spatial extent<br>
of the target. (Under ideal conditions, it is possible to carry this technique to<br>
its limit: a full reconstruction of the target geometry by an inversion process.)<br>
Additional information about the target size and geometry may be<br>
obtained by repeating the "imaging" process at different microwave<br>
frequencies. Two factors contribute to this:<br>
1.   The receiver array has different angular resolution and ambiguity pattern<br>
at different microwave frequencies. The combination of measurements at<br>
different frequencies reduces overall ambiguities and improves<br>
resolution.<br>
2.   The target scattering cross-section is a function of the ratio of target size<br>
to the wavelength ?. For d/?
(Rayleigh). For d/?
the physical size of the target (optical region). For d/?
oscillates dramatically (Mie or resonance region). The wavelengths<br>
involved are 12mm @24GHz and 5mm @61GHz (the two ISM<br>
frequencies). Measurements of the ratio of received signals at the two<br>
frequencies provide discrimination of insects larger than about 20mrn and<br>
smaller than about 2.5mm.<br>
The invention is not limited to imaging applications. The method<br>
permits the generation and control of an arbitrary receiver near field pattern.<br>
For example, a zone pattern may be generated for the purposes of detection<br>
and counting of zone transits by insects or other moving objects. Such<br>
techniques are well known in the security industry. For example, a standard<br>
PIR (Passive Infrared) security sensor usually includes a special Fresnel<br>
Lens to generate a fixed zone pattern.<br>
The present invention provides a control and processing of the field<br>
pattern of a receiver antenna array. It provides accurate detection and<br>
determination of the type of target in a spatial region in the near field of an<br>
antenna.<br>
The array of elements in the receiver antenna of the present invention<br>
provides significant advantages over a single element:<br>
1.   At least 3dB SNR improvement due to coherent processing;<br>
2.   Suppression of destructive interference between Fresnel zones;<br>
3.   Suppression of spurious static reflections;<br>
4.   Suppression of spurious microphonic effects due to operator<br>
handshake;<br>
5.   Tracking of insect movement;<br>
6.   Deliberate placement of nodes and/or antinodes at specific spatial<br>
locations; and<br>
7.   Indication of the direction of motion of the insects. This is useful in<br>
identifying insect galleries and in tracking these back to the nest.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, deliberate placement<br>
and control of nulls (and maxima) are provided in the receiver pattern of the<br>
array. For example, the nulls can be made to form concentric circles 10mm<br>
apart. Insect movement across these maxima and minima result in<br>
fluctuations of the received signal. Temporal analysis of these fluctuations<br>
can reveal insect activity. This implementation provides information with<br>
simpler processing. However, it is difficult to separate the information about<br>
insect numbers from insect speed. Hence, this method may be used as a<br>
"watchdog operation". Insect activity above a threshold can be used to trigger<br>
the instrument into full imaging mode. In another variant, the placement of<br>
maxima and nulls may be directional, in order to compute the direction of<br>
motion of the insects directly.<br>
This mode of operation can be enhanced by adding a mechanism to<br>
provoke the target insects into activity. The provocation may take the firm of<br>
a mechanical disturbance, an acoustic disturbance or an electromagnetic<br>
disturbance. It is known that certain acoustic and electromagnetic<br>
frequencies disturb insects, which will cause greater movement and<br>
therefore lead to stronger and more frequent disturbances of the<br>
electromagnetic fields. A thorough exposition on methods of insect control<br>
using electromagnetic emissions is presented by Philip Callahan in US<br>
patent 5,528,049, (1996), which also refers to prior art.<br>
The invention has been described with reference to exemplary<br>
embodiments. However, it should be noted that other embodiments are<br>
envisaged within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
