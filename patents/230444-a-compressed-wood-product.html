DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPRESSED WOOD PRODUCT AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE EXTERIOR MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a compressed wood product including a compressed wood and an electronic device exterior material including the compressed wood product.<br>
This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004-013237, 2004-013238, and 2004-013239 filed on January 21, 2004; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Examples of a portable electric device which can be operated on hand include a camera, a mobile communication device (mainly cellular phone), an IC recorder, a PDA, a portable television, a portable radio, and remote controls for various home appliances.    Usually, synthetic resins (ABS, polycarbonate, acrylic, and the like), light metals (aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, magnesium, and the like) are used as the exterior material for a portable electronic device due to industrial mass production.    Such synthetic resins and light metals constituting the exterior material are oriented to industrial products while appropriate strength is obtained, so that there is no individual difference<br><br>
in appearance.    Further, in the synthetic resins and the light metals constituting the exterior material, a flaw and discoloration are generated in long-term use.    However, the flaw and the discoloration only impair the worth of the electronic device.<br>
Therefore, it is thought that one may use wood which is of a natural raw material as the exterior material.    Because the wood has various kinds of grain, the wood has the individual difference and individuality.    Although the flaw and a change in color shade are generated in the long-term use in the wood, they become the unique feel and texture of the wood to cause users to feel an affinity.<br>
However, when the wood is three-dimensionally processed for the exterior material, there is a fear for strength of the wood. Specifically, in the exterior material made of wood, when the same strength as that of the synthetic resins or the light metals is demanded, since the increase in thickness of the wood is required, the wood is not suitable for the exterior material of the portable electronic device.    On the other hand, in the exterior material made of wood, when the same size as that of the exterior material formed of the synthetic resins or the light metals is demanded, the strength is decreased because the thickness is made smaller.    Therefore, in the conventional art, there is a technology in which the strength is obtained by compressing the wood as described below.<br>
Conventionally, a method is well known in which the wood softened by absorbing moisture is compressed and held to fix a shape, then is sliced in a compression direction to obtain a plate-shaped<br><br>
primary fixed product, the primary fixed product is formed in a formed product having a predetermined three-dimensional shape while heated and absorbed, and the shape of the formed product is fixed to obtain a secondary fixed product (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 3078452).<br>
A method, in which a woody material compressed in a state in which the softening treatment is performed is temporarily fixed and then is recovered in a form to perform forming, is conventionally well known as a method of three-dimensionally processing the woody material (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-77619).<br>
However, it is known that the strength of the wood is varied depending on the compression direction with respect to the wood. Namely, sometimes there is a fear that the wood is broken by the compression.    Particularly, when the wood is three-dimensionally processed, it is necessary to take the compression direction with respect to the wood into consideration.    In the conventional arts described above, the wood is first compressed in a certain compression direction, and then the wood is compressed (pressed) in the direction different from the previous compression direction, so that there is a possibility that the wood is broken.<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of the invention is to provide a compressed wood product and an electronic device exterior material which can improve the strength of the wood by previously considering the compression direction with respect to the wood to take the shape of the wood and performing the compression forming.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A compressed wood product of claim 1 according to the present invention, comprises a wood whose shape is taken while a volume decreased by compression is previously added, wherein a direction intersecting a fiber direction of the wood is set to a compression direction, and the wood is formed by being subjected to compressive force.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the wood whose shape is taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added in the direction intersecting the fiber direction, the fiber density is increased, which imparts high strength to the overall wood.    As a result, the strength of the compressed wood product can be improved by the three-dimensional compression.<br>
In claim 2, the compressed wood product of claim 1 according to the present invention includes a main plate portion in which a surface emerging in a thickness direction has a flat-grain surface and a side plate portion provided while rising from the main plate portion, the shape of the main plate portion being taken with a thickness to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, the shape of the side plate portion being taken with a thickness and a height to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force<br><br>
is applied to the main plate portion and the side plate portion in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, the density of the hard fibers of the grain is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion and the side plate portion.<br>
In claim 3, the compressed wood product of claim 2 according to the present invention includes a curved portion provided between the main plate portion and the side plate portion, the shape of the curved portion being taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, wherein the curved portion is subjected to both the compressive force to which the main plate portion is subjected and the compressive force to which the side plate portion is subjected.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the curved portion in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated or in the direction along the grain, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength to the curved portion.<br>
In claim 4, the compressed wood product of claim 1 according to the present invention includes a main plate portion in which the surface emerging in a thickness direction has an edge-grain surface and a side plate portion provided while rising from the main plate portion, the shape of the main plate portion being taken with a thickness to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, the shape of the side piate portion being taken with a thickness and a height to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.<br><br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion and the side plate portion in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, the density of the hard fibers of the grain is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion and the side plate portion.    In this case, since the main plate portion has the edge-grain surface, the grain (fiber) emerges in high density in the main plate portion. Therefore, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved when the wood comes into contact with a human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain becomes slip resistance. Further, the appearance of the wood is improved because the grain emerges in high density in the main plate portion.<br>
In claim 5, the compressed wood product of claim 4 according to the present invention includes a curved portion provided between the main plate portion and the side plate portion, the shape of the curved portion being taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, wherein the curved portion is subjected to both the compressive force to which the main plate portion is subjected and the compressive force to which the side plate portion is subjected.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the curved portion in the oblique direction with respect to the grain, that is, in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, or in the direction along the grain, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength to the curved portion.<br>
In claim 6, the compressed wood product of claim 1 according to<br><br>
the present invention includes a main plate portion in which the surface emerging in a thickness direction has a straight-grain surface and a side plate portion provided while rising from the main plate portion, the shape of the main plate portion being taken with a thickness to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, the shape of the side plate portion being taken with a thickness and a height to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.<br>
According to the present invention, since the main plate portion is compressed while the grain of the wood is curved and deformed, the pieces of fiber are bundled to increase the fiber density, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion.    Further, since the compressive force is applied to side plate portion in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, the density of the hard fibers of the grain is increased, which imparts the high strength to the side plate portion.    In this case, since the main plate portion has the straight-grain surface, the grain (fiber) emerges in high density in the main plate portion.    Therefore, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved when the wood comes into contact with the human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain becomes the slip resistance.    Further, the appearance of the wood is improved because the grain emerges in high density in the main plate portion.<br>
In claim 7, the compressed wood product of claim 6 according to the present invention includes a curved portion provided between the main plate portion and the side plate portion, the shape of the curved<br><br>
portion being taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, wherein the curved portion is subjected to both the compressive force to which the main plate portion is subjected and the compressive force to which the side plate portion is subjected.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the curved portion in the oblique direction with respect to the grain, that is, in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, or in the direction along the grain, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength to the curved portion.<br>
In claim 8, the compressed wood product of claim 1 according to the present invention includes a main plate portion in which the surface emerging in a thickness direction has a straight-grain surface and a side plate portion provided while rising from the main plate portion, the shape of the main plate portion being taken with a width to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, the shape of the side plate portion being taken with a thickness to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion and the side plate portion in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, the density of the hard fibers of the grain is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion and the side plate portion.    In this case, since the main plate portion has the straight-grain surface, the grain (fiber) emerges in high density in the main plate portion. Therefore, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved<br><br>
when the wood comes into contact with the human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain becomes the slip resistance. Further, the appearance of the wood is improved because the grain emerges in high density in the main plate portion.<br>
In claim 9, the compressed wood product of claim 1 according to the present invention includes a main plate portion in which the surface emerging in a thickness direction has an edge-grain surface and a side plate portion provided while rising from the main plate portion, the shape of the main plate portion being taken with a width to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, the shape of the side plate portion being taken with a thickness to which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.<br>
According to the present invention, since the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion and the side plate portion in the direction in which the pieces of grain of the wood are laminated, the density of the hard fibers of the grain is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion and the side plate portion.    In this case, since the main plate portion has the edge-grain surface, the grain (fiber) emerges in high density in the main plate portion. Therefore, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved when the wood comes into contact with the human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain becomes the slip resistance. Further, the appearance of the wood is improved because the grain emerges in high density in the main plate portion.<br>
In claim 1 0, the compressed wood product of any one of claims<br><br>
1 to 9 according to the present invention is such that the lengthwise direction of the wood after being formed is taken along the fiber direction of the wood.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, the invention will be described in detail. (First Embodiment)<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view that depicts an electronic device in which a compressed wood product according to the present invention is used as an exterior material.    In Fig. 1, a digital camera is shown as an example of the electronic device.    The digital camera has a reinforcing frame 11 and an inner mechanism 12 inside an exterior material 10 formed by the compressed wood product.    The digital camera also has an imaging lens 13 and a liquid crystal monitor 14 while the imaging lens 13 and the liquid crystal monitor 14 are exposed to the outside of the exterior material 10.    The inner mechanism 12 includes an image pickup device 12a such as a CCD, a drive circuit 12b which drives the image pickup device 12a, a drive circuit 12c which drives the liquid crystal monitor 14, a recording device 12d for an image recording medium C, and a connection terminal 12e connected to an external<br><br>
personal computer.<br>
The exterior material 10 includes a front cover 10a and a rear cover 10b.    A lens hole 10c is made in a main plate portion of the front cover 10a so that the imaging lens 13 is projected outside of the front cover 10a.    The lens hole 10c is made corresponding to an outer shape of a holding portion which holds the imaging lens 13.    For example, when the holding portion has a cylindrical shape, the lens hole 10c is made in a circular shape so that the holding portion is projected outside of the front cover 10a.    An aperture 10d is provided in a side plate portion of the front cover 10a so that the image recording medium C is inserted into or extracted from the aperture 10d.    A rectangular window 10e is made in the main plate portion of the rear cover 10b so that the liquid crystal monitor 14 is exposed outside of the rear cover 10b.    An aperture 10f is provided in the side plate portion of the rear cover 10b so that a connection cable connected to the connection terminal 12e is inserted into or extracted from the aperture 10f.    In addition, although not shown in the drawings, button holes are provided on the front cover 10a and the rear cover 10b so that various operation buttons for operating the digital camera are exposed.    A cover or the like may be provided in the button hole if needed.<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view that depicts shape taking of the compressed wood product according to the present invention, and Fig. 3 is a plan view that depicts shape taking of the compressed wood product according to the present invention.    As shown in Fig. 2, the compressed wood product constituting the exterior material 10 is made<br><br>
by compressing a wood 1.    The shape of the wood 1 is taken from a raw material 100 before the wood 1 is compressed.    Examples of the raw material 100 include Japanese cypress (hinoki, hiba), paulownia (kiri), teak, mahogany, Japanese cedar, pine, and cherry.    The wood 1 is a lump including a main plate portion 1a having a predetermined shape (substantially rectangular shape in the first embodiment) and a side plate portion 1b provided while vertically rising from a periphery of the main plate portion 1a.     The main plate portion 1a forms the main plate portion of the front cover 10a or the rear cover 10b, and the side plate portion 1b forms the side plate portion of the front cover 10a or the rear cover 10b.    In the wood 1, the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b are formed so as to be coupled to each other in a curved surface.    In the wood 1, as shown in Fig. 2, the shape of the main plate portion 1a is taken along a fiber direction L of the raw material 100, and particularly it is preferable that a lengthwise direction of the shape of the main plate portion 1a is taken along a fiber direction L.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, there are three modes in which the shape of the wood 1 is taken from the raw material 100, i.e. a wood 1-1, a wood 1-2, and a wood 1-3.    In the wood 1-1, the pieces of grain G exist in a lamellar shape within a plate thickness of the main plate portion 1a, and the shape of the main plate portion 1a is taken while the surface emerging in the thickness direction has a flat-grain surface.    In the wood 1-2, the pieces of grain G exist in an obliquely lamellar shape within the plate thickness of the main plate portion 1a, and the shape of<br><br>
the main plate portion 1a is taken while the surface emerging in the thickness direction has an edge-grain surface.    In the wood 1-3, the pieces of grain G exist in the lamellar shape in the direction perpendicular to the plate thickness of the main plate portion 1a, and the shape of the main plate portion 1a is taken while the surface emerging in the thickness direction has a straight-grain surface.<br>
Fig. 4 is a view that depicts a compression process in the first embodiment of the invention.    Fig. 4 shows the compression process of the wood 1-1 in which the main plate portion 1a has the flat-grain surface.    The shape of the wood 1-1 is taken while a volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    Specifically, as shown in Fig. 4A, the shape of the main plate portion 1a is taken with a thickness W1 in which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    The shape of the side plate portion 1b is taken with a thickness W2 and a height T1 in which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    The shape of the wood 1-1 is taken with a total width H1.    The thickness W1 of the main plate portion 1a is formed larger than the thickness W2 of the side plate portion 1b.    A middle portion between the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b is formed in the curve so that the thickness W1 of the main plate portion 1a is gradually changed to the thickness W2 of the side plate portion 1b.   The side plate portion 1b is formed so as to rise obliquely outward from the main plate portion 1a.    In the wood 1-1, Fig. 4 shows the shape of either the front cover 10a or the rear cover 10b in the exterior material 10 formed of the compressed wood product.    The<br><br>
drawing and the description of the shape of the other are neglected because the shapes of the front cover 10a and the rear cover 10b are similar to each other.<br>
The wood 1-1 is compressed between a lower mold frame A and an upper mold frame B.    As shown in Fig. 4A, the lower mold frame A has a concave surface corresponding to a curved outside surface (lower surface in Fig. 4) in which the side plate portion 1b rises from the main plate portion 1a of the wood 1-1.    The concave surface of the lower mold frame A has the shape to which the outside surface of the wood 1-1 is fitted.    The radius of curvature of a curved surface RO at the outside surface of the wood 1-1 and the radius of curvature of a curved surface RA at the lower mold frame A which is opposite to the curved surface RO have a correlation of RO &gt; RA.    On the other hand, the upper mold frame B has a convex surface corresponding to a curved inside surface (upper surface in Fig. 4) in which the side plate portion 1b rises from the main plate portion 1a of the wood 1-1.    The convex surface of the upper mold frame B has the shape to which the inside surface of the wood 1-1 is fitted.    The radius of curvature of a curved surface Rl at the inside surface of the wood 1-1 and the radius of curvature of a curved surface RB at the upper mold frame B which is opposite to the curved surface Rl have the correlation of RI &gt; RB. After the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B are combined, i.e. after the wood 1-1 is compressed, a space formed between the concave surface of the lower mold frame A and the convex surface of the upper mold frame B has the shape of post-compression of the wood<br><br>
1-1 (see Fig. 4B).<br>
With reference to the wood 1-1 and the lower and upper mold frames A and B having the above-described configurations, first the wood 1-1 is placed in a water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure as shown in Fig. 4A.    When the wood 1-1 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure for a predetermined time, the wood 1-1 is softened by excessively absorbing moisture.    In the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure, the wood 1-1 is arranged between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B and on the concave surface of the lower mold frame A.    At this point, in the wood 1-1, since the main plate portion 1a has the flat-grain surface, the direction M in which the pieces of grain G are laminated exists in the vertical direction of Fig. 4, and the fiber direction L is along a depth direction of Fig. 4.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 4B, the wood 1-1 is compressed by bringing the upper mold frame B close to the lower mold frame A. Namely, the convex surface of the upper mold frame B is fitted into the concave surface of the lower mold frame A.    In the wood 1-1 sandwiched between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B, compressive force is applied to the main plate portion 1a in the thickness W1 direction (grain-G laminated direction M), and the compressive force is also applied to the main plate portion 1a in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Further, in the wood 1-1, the compressive force is applied to the side plate portion 1b in the thickness W2 direction (direction along the grain G) and in the<br><br>
height T1 direction (grain-G laminated direction), and the compressive force is also applied to the side plate portion 1b in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Further, in the wood 1-1, the compressive force is applied to a curved portion 1c which couples the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b in the grain-G laminated direction M and in the direction along the grain G, and the compressive force is also applied to the curved portion 1c in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L. Specifically, the curved portion 1c is formed so that the side plate portion 1b rises obliquely outward, and the radii of curvature of the lower and upper mold frames A and B have the relationship described above.    Therefore, the compressive force is applied upward to the outside surface of the curved portion 1c, and the compressive force is applied downward to the inside surface.    Then, the wood 1-1 is left for a predetermined time while the compressive force is applied to the wood 1-1.<br>
Finally, after the wood 1-1 is left for the predetermined time, the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure is released, the upper mold frame B is separated from the lower mold frame A, and the compressed wood 1-1 is taken out as shown in Fig. 4C.    In the compressed wood 1-1 taken out from between the lower and upper mold frames A and B, the wood 1-1 is compressed to substantially even thicknesses W1' and W2' at the main plated portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, respectively.    In the compressed wood 1-1, the side plate portion 1b is compressed to a height TV.    in<br><br>
the compressed wood 1-1, the curved portion 1c which couples the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b is compressed so that the pieces of grain G are deformed in the oblique direction.    The compressed wood 1-1 is slightly compressed to a width H1'.<br>
Thus, in the wood 1-1 compressed in the first embodiment, since the compressive force is applied in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L, the fiber density is increased, which imparts high strength to the overall wood 1-1.    In the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, since the compressive force is applied in the grain-G laminated direction M, the density of the hard fibers of the grain G is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b.    In the curved portion 1c which couples the main plate portion 1 a and the side plate portion 1b, since the compressive force is applied obliquely, the grain G is deformed in the oblique direction to increase the fiber density, which imparts the high strength to the curved portion 1c.    The lengthwise direction of the shape of the wood 1-1 is taken along the fiber direction L, which imparts the strength in the lengthwise direction in which the strength is lower.    As a result, the strength of the compressed wood product (electronic device exterior material) can be improved by the three-dimensional compression. (Second Embodiment)<br>
In a second embodiment described below, the descriptions similar to the contents described in Figs. 1 to 3 in the first embodiment are neglected.<br><br>
Fig. 5 is a view that depicts a compression process in the second embodiment of the invention.    Fig. 5 shows the compression process of the wood 1-2 in which the main plate portion 1a has the edge-grain surface.    The shape of the wood 1-2 is taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 5A, the shape of the main plate portion 1a is taken with a thickness W3 in which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    The shape of the side plate portion 1b is taken with a thickness W4 and a height T2 in which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    The shape of the wood 1-2 is taken with a total width H2.    The thickness W3 of the main plate portion 1a is formed larger than the thickness W4 of the side plate portion 1b.    The middle portion between the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b is formed in the curve so that the thickness W3 of the main plate portion 1a is gradually changed to the thickness W4 of the side plate portion 1b.    The side plate portion 1b is formed so as to rise obliquely outward from the main plate portion 1a.    In the wood 1-2, Fig. 5 shows the shape of either the front cover 10a or the rear cover 10b in the exterior material 10 formed of the compressed wood product. The drawing and the description of the shape of the other are neglected because the shapes of the front cover 10a and the rear cover 10b are similar to each other.<br>
The wood 1-2 is compressed between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B.    As shown in Fig. 5A, the lower mold frame A has the concave surface corresponding to the curved outside<br><br>
surface (lower surface in Fig. 5) in which the side plate portion 1b rises from the main plate portion la of the wood 1-2.    The concave surface of the lower mold frame A has the shape to which the outside surface of the wood 1-2 is fitted.    The radius of curvature of the curved surface RO at the outside surface of the wood 1-2 and the radius of curvature of the curved surface RA at the lower mold frame A which is opposite to the curved surface RO have the correlation of RO &gt; RA.    On the other hand, the upper mold frame B has the convex surface corresponding to the curved inside surface (upper surface in Fig. 5) in which the side plate portion 1b rises from the main plate portion 1a of the wood 1-2. The convex surface of the upper mold frame B has the shape to which the inside surface of the wood 1-2 is fitted.    The radius of curvature of the curved surface Rl at the inside surface of the wood 1-2 and the radius of curvature of the curved surface RB at the upper mold frame B which is opposite to the curved surface Rl have the correlation of Rl &gt; RB.    After the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B are combined, i.e. after the wood 1-2 is compressed, the space formed between the concave surface of the lower mold frame A and the convex surface of the upper mold frame B has the shape of post-compression of the wood 1-2 (see Fig. 5B).<br>
With reference to the wood 1-2 and the lower and upper mold frames A and B having the above-described configuration, first the wood 1-2 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure as shown in Fig. 5A.    When the wood 1-2 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure<br><br>
for a predetermined time, the wood 1-2 is softened by excessively absorbing the moisture.    In the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure, the wood 1-2 is arranged between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B and on the concave surface of the lower mold frame A.    At this point, in the wood 1-2, since the main plate portion 1a has the edge-grain surface, the grain-G laminated direction M exists in the oblique direction of Fig. 5, and the fiber direction L is along the depth direction of Fig. 5.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 5B, the wood 1-2 is compressed by bringing the upper mold frame B close to the lower mold frame A. Namely, the convex surface of the upper mold frame B is fitted into the concave surface of the lower mold frame A.    In the wood 1-2 sandwiched between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B, the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion 1a in the thickness W3 direction (substantial grain-G laminated direction M), and the compressive force is also applied to the main plate portion 1a in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Further, in the wood 1-2, the compressive force is applied to the side plate portion 1b in the thickness W4 direction (substantially grain-G laminated direction M) and in the height T2 direction (direction substantially along the grain G), and the compressive force is also applied to the side plate portion 1b in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Further, in the wood 1-2, the compressive force is applied to one curved portion 1c (left side in Fig. 5) which couples the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b in the grain-G laminated<br><br>
direction M, and the compressive force is also applied to the other curved portion 1c (right side in Fig. 5) in the direction along the grain G and in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L. Specifically, the curved portion 1c is formed so that the side plate portion 1b rises obliquely outward, and the radii of curvature of the lower and upper mold frames A and B have the relationship described above.    Therefore, the compressive force is applied upward to the outside surface of the curved portion 1c, and the compressive force is applied downward to the inside surface.    Then, the wood 1-2 is left for a predetermined time while the compressive force is applied to the wood 1-2.<br>
Finally, after the wood 1-2 is left for the predetermined time, the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure is released, the upper mold frame B is separated from the lower mold frame A, and the compressed wood 1-2 is taken out as shown in Fig. 5C.    In the compressed wood 1-2 which is taken out, the wood 1-2 is compressed to substantially even thicknesses W3' and W4' at the main plated portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, respectively.    In the compressed wood 1-2, the side plate portion 1b is compressed to a height T2\    In the curved portions 1c of the compressed wood 1-2, which couple the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, one curved portion 1c (left side in Fig. 5) is compressed so that the pieces of grain G are laminated, and the other curved portion 1c (right .side in Fig. 5) is compressed so that the pieces of grain G are curved and deformed.    The compressed wood 1-2 is slightly compressed to a<br><br>
width H2'.<br>
Thus, in the wood 1-2 compressed in the second embodiment, since the compressive force is applied in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength to the overall wood 1-2.    In the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, since the compressive force is applied in the grain-G laminated direction M, the density of the hard fibers of the grain G is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b.    In the curved portions 1c which couple the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, since the compressive force is applied to one curved portion 1c (left side in Fig. 5) in the grain-G laminated direction M, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength.    Further, since the other curved portion 1c (right side in Fig. 5) is compressed so that the pieces of the grain G are curved and deformed, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength.     The lengthwise direction of the shape of the wood 1-2 is taken along the fiber direction L, which imparts the strength in the lengthwise direction in which the strength is lower.    As a result, the strengths of the compressed wood product and the electronic device exterior material can be improved by the three-dimensional compression.<br>
In the second embodiment, the woods 1-2 is applied, the shape of which is taken while main plate portion 1a thereof has the edge-grain surface.    Therefore, since the grain G (fiber) emerges in higher density in the main plate portion 1a when compared with the first embodiment,<br><br>
combined, i.e. after the wood 1-3 is compressed, the space formed between the concave surface of the lower mold frame A and the convex surface of the upper mold frame B has the shape of post-compression of the wood 1-3 (see Fig. 6B).<br>
With reference to the wood 1-3 and the lower and upper mold frames A and B having the above-described configuration, first the wood 1-3 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure as shown in Fig. 6A.    When the wood 1-3 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure for a predetermined time, the wood 1-3 is softened by excessively absorbing the moisture.    In the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure, the wood 1-3 is arranged between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B and on the concave surface of the lower mold frame A.   At this point, in the wood 1-3, since the main plate portion 1a has the straight-grain surface, the grain-G laminated direction M exists in the horizontal direction of Fig. 6, and the fiber direction L is along the depth direction of Fig. 6.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 6B, the wood 1-3 is compressed by bringing the upper mold frame B close to the lower mold frame A. Namely, the convex surface of the upper mold frame B is fitted into the concave surface of the lower mold frame A.    In the wood 1-3 sandwiched between the lower mold frame A and the upper mold frame B, the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion 1a in the thickness W5 direction (direction along the grain G), and the compressive force is also applied to the main plate portion 1a in the<br><br>
direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Further, in the wood 1-3, the compressive force is applied to the side plate portion 1b in the thickness W6 direction (grain-G laminated direction M) and the height T3 direction (direction along the grain G), and the compressive force is also applied to the side plate portion 1b in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L    Further, in the wood 1-3, the compressive force is applied to the curved portion 1c which couples the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b in the grain-G laminated direction M and the direction along the grain G, and the compressive force is also applied to the curved portion 1c in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Specifically, the curved portion 1c is formed so that the side plate portion 1b rises obliquely outward, and the radii of curvature of the lower and upper mold frames A and B have the relationship described above. Therefore, the compressive force is applied upward to the outside surface of the curved portion 1c, and the compressive force is applied downward to the inside surface.    Then, the wood 1-3 is left for a predetermined time while the compressive force is applied to the wood<br>
Finally, after the wood 1-3 is left for the predetermined time, the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure is released, the upper mold frame B is separated from the lower mold frame A, and the compressed wood 1-3 is taken out as shown in Fig. 6C.    In the compressed wood 1-3 taken out, the wood 1-3 is compressed to substantially even thicknesses W5' and W61 at the main<br><br>
plated portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, respectively.    In the compressed wood 1-3, the side plate portion 1b is compressed to a height T3\    In the compressed wood 1-3, the curved portion 1o which couples the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b is compressed so that the pieces of grain G are laminated.      The compressed wood 1-3 is slightly compressed to a width H3'.<br>
Thus, in the wood 1-3 compressed in the third embodiment, since the compressive force is applied in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength to the overall wood 1-3.    Since the main plate portion 1a is compressed while the pieces of grain are curved and deformed, the pieces of fiber are bundled to increase the fiber density, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion 1a.    In the side plate portion 1b, since the compressive force is applied in the grain-G laminated direction M, the density of the hard fibers of the grain G is increased, which imparts the high strength to the side plate portion 1b.    In the curved portion 1c which couples the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, since the compressive force is applied in the grain-G laminated direction M, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength.    The lengthwise direction of the shape of the wood 1-3 is taken along the fiber direction L, which imparts the strength in the lengthwise direction in which the strength is lower.    As a result, the strength of the compressed wood product and the electronic device exterior material can be improved by the three-dimensional compression.<br><br>
In the third embodiment, the woods 1-3 is applied, the shape of which is taken while the main plate portion 1a thereof has the straight-grain surface.    Therefore, since the grain G (fiber) emerges in higher density in the main plate portion 1a when compared with the first embodiment or the second embodiment, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved when the wood 1-3 comes into contact with the human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain G becomes the slip resistance.    Further, the appearance of the wood is further improved because the grain G emerges in higher density in the main plate portion 1a when compared with the first embodiment or the second embodiment. (Fourth Embodiment)<br>
In a fourth embodiment described below, the descriptions similar to the contents described in Figs. 1 to 3 in the first embodiment are neglected.<br>
Fig. 7 is a view that depicts a compression process in the fourth embodiment.    Fig. 7 shows the compression process of the wood 1-3 in which the main plate portion 1a has the straight-grain surface.     The shape of the wood 1 -3 is taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    Specifically, as shown in Fig. 7A, the shape of the side plate portion 1b is taken with a thickness W8 in which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, and the side plate portion 1b has a height T4 substantially equal to that of the post-compression.    The main plate portion 1a has a thickness W7 substantially equal to the post-compression, and the shape of the<br><br>
wood 1-3 is taken with a width H4 in which the volume totally decreased by the compression is previously added.     The thickness W8 of the side plate portion 1b is formed larger than the thickness W7 of the main plate portion 1a.    The middle portion between the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b is formed in the curve so that the thickness W8 of the side plate portion 1b is gradually changed to the thickness W7 of the main plate portion 1a.    In the wood 1-3, Fig. 7 shows the shape of either the front cover 10a or the rear cover 10b in the exterior material 10 formed of the compressed wood product.    The drawing and the description of the shape  of the other are neglected because the shapes of the front cover 10a and the rear cover 10b are similar to each other.<br>
With reference to the wood 1-3 having the above-described configuration, first the wood 1-3 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure as shown in Fig. 7A. When the wood 1-3 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure for a predetermined time, the wood 1-3 is softened by excessively absorbing the moisture.    At this point, in the wood 1-3, since the main plate portion 1a has the straight-grain surface, the grain-G laminated direction M exists in the horizontal direction of Fig. 7, and the fiber direction L is along thie depth direction of Fig. 7.<br>
Then, the wood 1-3 is compressed.    At this point, the compression direction is an arrow P direction shown in Fig. 7B. Therefore, in the wood 1-3, the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion 1a in the width H4 direction (grain-G laminated direction<br><br>
M), and the compressive force is also applied to the main plate portion 1a in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L. Further, in the wood 1-3, the compressive force is applied to the side plate portion 1b in the thickness W8 direction (grain-G laminated direction M), and the compressive force is also applied to the side plate portion 1b in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Then, the wood 1-3 is left for a predetermined time while the compressive force is applied to the wood 1-3.<br>
Finally, after the wood 1-3 is left for the predetermined time, the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure is released, and the compressed wood 1-3 is taken out.    In the compressed wood 1-3 taken out, the wood 1-3 is compressed to substantially even thicknesses W7' and W81 at the main plated portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, respectively.    In the compressed wood 1-3, the side plate portion 1b is compressed to a height T41 substantially equal to the height T4 in the pre-compression.    The compressed wood 1-3 is compressed to a width H4'.<br>
Thus, in the wood 1-3 compressed in the fourth embodiment, since the compressive force is applied in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L, the fiber density is increased, which imparts the high strength to the overall wood 1-3.    Since the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b are compressed in the grain-G laminated direction M, the density of the hard fibers of the grain G is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b.    The lengthwise direction of the shape of<br><br>
the wood 1-3 is taken along the fiber direction L, which imparts the strength in the lengthwise direction in which the strength is lower.    As a result, the strength of the compressed wood product and the electronic device exterior material can be improved by the three-dimensional compression.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, the wood 1-3 is applied, the shape of which is taken while the main plate portion 1a thereof has the straight-grain surface.    Therefore, since the grain G (fiber) emerges in higher density in the main plate portion 1a when compared with the first embodiment or the second embodiment, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved when the wood 1-3 comes into contact with the human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain G becomes the slip resistance.    Further, the appearance of the wood is further improved because the grain G emerges in higher density in the main plate portion 1a when compared with the first embodiment or the second embodiment. (Fifth Embodiment)<br>
In a fifth embodiment described below, the descriptions similar to the contents described in Figs. 1 to 3 in the first embodiment are neglected.<br>
Fig. 8 is a view that depicts a compression process in the fifth embodiment.    Fig. 8 shows the compression process of the wood 1-2 in which the main plate portion 1a has the edge-grain surface.    The shape of the wood 1-2 is taken while the volume decreased by the compression is previously added.    Specifically, as shown in Fig. 8A,<br><br>
the shape of the side plate portion 1b is taken with a thickness W10 in which the volume decreased by the compression is previously added, and the side plate portion 1b has a height T5 substantially equal to that of the post-compression.    The main plate portion 1a has a thickness W9 substantially equal to the post-compression, and the shape of the wood 1-2 is taken with a width H5 in which the volume totally decreased by the compression is previously added.    The thickness W10 of the side plate portion 1b is formed larger than the thickness W9 of the main plate portion 1a.    The middle portion between the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b is formed in the curve so that the thickness W10 of the side plate portion 1b is gradually changed to the thickness W9 of the main plate portion 1a.    In the wood 1-2, Fig. 8 shows the shape of either the front cover 10a or the rear cover 10b in the exterior material 10-formed of the compressed wood product.    The drawing and the description of the shape of the other are neglected because the shapes of the front cover 10a and the rear cover 10b are similar to each other.<br>
With reference to the wood 1-2 having the above-described configuration, first the wood 1-2 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure as shown in Fig. 8A. When the wood 1-2 is placed in the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure for a predetermined time, the wood 1-2 is softened by excessively absorbing the moisture.    At this point, in the wood 1-2, since the main plate portion 1a has the edge-grain surface, the grain-G laminated direction M exists in the oblique direction of Fig.<br><br>
8, and the fiber direction L is along the depth direction of Fig. 8.<br>
Then, the wood 1-2 is compressed.    At this point, the compression direction is the arrow P direction shown in Fig. 8B. Therefore, in the wood 1-2, the compressive force is applied to the main plate portion 1a in the width H5 direction (substantial grain-G laminated direction), and the compressive force is also applied to the main plate portion 1a in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L.    Further, in the wood 1-2, the compressive force is applied to the side plate portion 1b in the thickness W10 direction (substantial grain-G laminated direction M), and the compressive force is also applied to the side plate portion 1b in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L    Then, the wood 1-2 is left for a predetermined time while the compressive force is applied to the wood 1-2.<br>
Finally, after the wood 1-2 is left for the predetermined time, the water vapor atmosphere at high temperature and high pressure is released, and the compressed wood 1-2 is taken out.    In the compressed wood 1-2 taken out, the wood 1-2 is compressed to substantially even thicknesses W9' and W10' at the main plated portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b, respectively.    In the compressed wood 1-2, the side plate portion 1b is compressed to a height T5' substantially equal to the height T5 in the pre-compression.    The compressed wood 1-2 is compressed to a width H5'.<br>
Thus, in the wood 1-2 compressed in the fifth embodiment, since the compressive force is applied in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L, the fiber density is increased, which<br><br>
imparts the high strength to the overall wood 1-2.    Since the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b are compressed in the grain-G laminated direction M, the density of the hard fibers of the grain G is increased, which imparts the high strength to the main plate portion 1a and the side plate portion 1b.    The lengthwise direction of the shape of the wood 1-2 is taken along the fiber direction L, which imparts the strength in the lengthwise direction in which the strength is lower.   As a result, the strength of the compressed wood product and the electronic device exterior material can be improved by the three-dimensional compression.<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the wood 1-2 is applied, the shape of which is taken while the main plate portion 1a has the edge grain surface.    Therefore, since the grain G (fiber) emerges in higher density in the main plate portion when compared with the first embodiment, the perspiration absorption characteristics are improved when the wood 1-2 comes into contact with the human hand to cause portability to be improved, and the grain G becomes the slip resistance.    Further, the appearance of the wood is further improved because the grain G emerges in higher density in the main plate portion 1a when compared with the first embodiment.<br>
It is possible to burn the surface of the wood 1 (compressed wood product) obtained by the compression in the first embodiment to the fifth embodiment.    Depressions and projections are generated in the grain G portion by burning the surface of the wood 1, which results in effects of the perspiration absorption characteristics and the slip<br><br>
resistance from the beginning of use.    Further, a carbonized layer obtained by burning the surface of the wood 1 becomes a conductive material, and the carbonized layer becomes an electromagnetic shielding material which is far lighter than metal, so that the wood 1 obtained by the compression in the first embodiment to the fifth embodiment can be used effectively as the electronic device exterior material.<br>
In the first embodiment to the fifth embodiment, the compressed wood product having the structure in which the side plate portion 1b rises from the main plate portion 1a is described as an example. However, the invention is not limited to the first embodiment to the fifth embodiment.    As described above, the invention can be applied to any shape of goods, e.g. tableware, as long as the strength is obtained by applying the compressive force in the direction intersecting (orthogonal to) the fiber direction L of the wood 1.    For the electronic device exterior material, the invention is not limited to the digital camera, but the invention can be applied to the portable electronic device such as a camera, a mobile communication device (mainly cellular phone), an IC recorder, a PDA, a portable television, a portable radio, and a remote control for various home appliances.<br>
