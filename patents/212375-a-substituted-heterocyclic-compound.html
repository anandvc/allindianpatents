THROMBIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to nor-seco himbacine derivatives useful as thrombin receptor antagonists in the treatment of diseases associated with thrombosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebral ischemia, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Thrombin receptor antagonists are also known as protease activated receptor (PAR) antagonists, The compounds of the invention also bind to cannabinoid (CB2) receptors and are useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, osteoporosis, renal ischemia, cerebral<br>
stroke, cerebral ischemia, nephritis, inflammatory disorders of the lungs and<br>
*<br>
gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract disorders such as reversible airway obstruction, chronic asthma and bronchitis. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds.<br>
Thrombin is known to have a variety of activities in different cell types and thrombin receptors are known to be present in such cell types as human platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. It is therefore expected that thrombin receptor antagonists will be useful in the treatment of thrombotic, inflammatory, atherosclerotic and fibroproliferative disorders, as well as other disorders in which thrombin and its receptor play a pathological role.<br>
Thrombin receptor antagonist peptides have been identified based on structure-activity studies involving substitutions of amino acids on thrombin receptors. In Bernatowicz et alf J. Med. Chem.. 39 (1996), p. 4879-4887, tetra- and pentapeptides are disclosed as being potent thrombin receptor antagonists, for example N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu«Arg-NH2 and N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe«p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-Arg-NH2^ Peptide thrombin receptor anatgonists are also disclosed in WO 94/03479, published February 17, 1994.<br>
Cannabinoid receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. They are classified into the predominantly neuronal CB1 receptors and the predominantly peripheral CB2 receptors. These receptors exert their biological<br><br>
actions by modulating adenylate cyclase and Ca+2 and K+ currents. While the effects of CB1 receptors are principally associated with the central nervous system, CB2 receptors are believed to have peripheral effects related to bronchial constriction, immunomodulation and inflammation. As such, a selective CB2 receptor binding agent is expected to have therapeutic utility in the control of diseases associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, osteoporosis, renal ischemia, cerebral stroke, cerebral ischemia, nephritis, inflammatory disorders of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract disorders such as reversible airway obstruction, chronic asthma and bronchitis (R. G, Pertwee, Curr. Med. Chem. 6(8), (1999), 635).<br>
Himbacine, a piperidine alkaloid of the formula<br>
has been identified as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. The total synthesis of (+)-himbacine is disclosed in Chackalamannil et al, J. Am. Chem Soc. 118 (1996), p. 9812-9813.<br>
Tricyclic himbacine-reiated compounds have been disclosed as thrombin receptor antagonists in US 6,063,847.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Unless otherwise defined, the term "alkyl" or "lower alky!" means straight or branched alkyl chains of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and "alkoxy" similarly refers to alkoxy groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
FluoroalkyI, difluoroalkyl and trifluoroalkyl mean alkyl chains wherein the terminal carbon is substituted by 1, 2 or 3 fluoroatoms, e.g., -CF3, -CH2CF3, -CH2CHF2 or -CH2CH2F. Haloalkyl means an alkyl chain substituted by 1 to 3 halo<br>
atoms.<br>
"Alkenyl" means straight or branched carbon chains of carbon atoms having one or more double bonds in the chain, conjugated or unconjugated. Similarly, "alkynyl" means straight or branched carbon chains of carbon atoms having one or more triple bonds in the chain. Where an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chain joins two other variables and is therefore bivalent, the terms aikylene, alkenylene and alkynylene are used. Unless otherwise defined, alkenyl and alkynyl chains comprise 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Substitution on alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl chains depends on the length of the chain, and the size and nature of the substituent. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that while longer chains can accommodate multiple substituents, shorter alkyl chains, e.g., methyl or ethyl, can have multiple substitution by halogen, but otherwise are likely to have only one or two substituents other than hydrogen. Shorter unsaturated chains, e.g., ethenyl or ethynyl, are generally unsubstituted or substitution is limited to one or two groups, depending on the number of available carbon bonds.<br><br>
"Cycloalkyl" means a saturated carbon ring of 3 to 7 carbon atoms, while "cycloalkylene" refers to a corresponding bivalent ring, wherein the points of attachment to other groups include all positional and stereoisomers. "Cycloalkenyl" refers to a carbon ring of 3 to 7 atoms and having one or more unsaturated bonds, but not having an aromatic nature.<br>
"Heterocycioalkyl" means saturated rings of 5 or 6 atoms comprised of 4 to 5 carbon atoms and 1 or 2 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of -0-, -S-and -NR7- joined to the rest of the molecule through a carbon atom. Examples of heterocycioalkyl groups are 2-pyrroiidinyl, tetrahydrothiophen-2-yi, tetrahydro-2~ furanyl, 4-piperidinyl, 2-piperaziny!, tetrahydro-4-pyranyl, 2-morpholinyi and 2-thiomorpholinyl.<br>
"Halogen" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine radicals.<br>
When R4 and R5 join to form a ring with the nitrogen to which they are attached, the rings formed are 1-pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperidinyl and 1-piperazinyl, wherein the piperazinyl ring may also be substituted at the 4-position nitrogen by a group R7.<br>
,,Dihydroxy(C1-C6)alkyr' refers to an alkyl chain substituted by two hydroxy<br>
groups on two different carbon atoms.<br>
"Aryl" means phenyl, naphthyl, indenyl, tetrahydronaphthyl or indanyl.<br>
"Heteroaryl" means a single ring or benzofused heteroaromatic group of 5 to 10 atoms comprised of 2 to 9 carbon atoms and 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S, provided that the rings do not include adjacent oxygen and/or sulfur atoms. N-oxides of the ring nitrogens are also included, as well as compounds wherein a ring nitrogen is substituted by a C1-C4<br>
alkyl group to form a quaternary amine. Examples of single-ring heteroaryl groups are pyridyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyi, pyrazinyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl and triazolyl. Examples of benzofused heteroaryl groups are indolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, phthalazinyl, benzothienyl (i.e., thionaphthenyl), benzimidazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzoxazolyl and benzofurazanyl. All positional isomers are contemplated, e.g., 2-pyridyI, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyI. W-substituted heteroaryl refers to such groups wherein substitutable ring carbon atoms have a substituent as defined above, or where adjacent carbon atoms form a ring with an alkylene group or a methylenedioxy group, or where a nitrogen in the Het ring can be substituted with R21-aryl or an optionally substituted alkyl substituent as defined in W.<br>
The term "Het" is exemplified by the single ring and benzofused heteroaryl groups as defined immediately above, as well as tricyclic groups such as<br><br>
benzoquinolinyl (e.g., 1,4 or 7,8) or phenanthrolinyl (e.g., 1,7; 1,10; or 4,7). Het groups are joined to group B by a carbon ring member, e.g., Het is 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl<br>
or 2-quinolyl.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups wherein adjacent carbon atoms form a ring with an alkylene group are 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine, 2,3-cyclohexenopyridine and 2,3-cycloheptenopyridine.<br>
The term "optional double bond" refers to the bond shown by the single dotted line in the middle ring of the structure shown for formula I. The term "optional single bond" refers to the bond shown by the double dotted line between X and the carbon to which Y and R15 are attached in the structure of formula I.<br>
The above statements, wherein, for example, R4 and R5 are said to be independently selected from a group of substituents, means that R4 and R5 are independently selected, but also that where an R4 or R5 variable occurs more than once in a molecule, those occurrences are independently selected. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the size and nature of the substituent(s) will affect the number of substituents which can be present.<br>
Compounds of the invention have at least one asymmetrical carbon atom and<br>
therefore all isomers, including diastereomers and rotational isomers are<br>
*<br>
contemplated as being part of this invention. The invention includes (+)- and (-)-isomers in both pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting optically pure or optically enriched starting materials or by separating isomers of a compound of formula I.<br>
Typical preferred compounds of the present invention have the following stereochemistry: <br>
with compounds having that absolute stereochemistry being more preferred.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some compounds of formula I, one isomer will show greater pharmacological activity than other isomers.<br>
Compounds of the invention with a basic group can form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and<br><br>
carboxylic acids well known to those in the "art. The salt is prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. The free base form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The free base form differs from its respective salt form somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salt is otherwise equivalent to its respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention are acidic (e.g., those compounds which possess a carboxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. Examples of such salts are the sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, gold and silver salts. Also included are salts formed with pharmaceutical^ acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are generally prepared by processes known in the art, for example by the processes described below.<br>
Compounds of formula IA, wherein n is 0, the optional double bond is not present, the single bond is present between X and the carbon to which Y is attached, .   X is -0-, Y is =0, B is -CH=CH^, Het is W-substitued pyridyl, R3, R8, R9, RIO and R1^ are each hydrogen, and R1 and R2 are as defined above can be prepared by condensing an aldehyde of formula II, wherein the variables are as defined above, with a phosphonate of formula III, wherein W is as defined above:<br><br>
Similar processes may be used to prepare compounds comprising other optionally substituted Het groups. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the processes are equally applicable to preparing optically active or racemic compounds.<br>
Compounds of formula IA can be converted to the corresponding compounds wherein R3 is OH by treatment with Davis reagent ((1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine) and LHMDS (Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide).<br>
Aldehydes of formula II can be prepared from dienoic acids, for example compounds of formula lla, wherein R1 is H and R2 is methyl can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme.<br><br><br>
The alkyne of formula 4, prepared by known methods, is esterified with the dienoic acid of.formula 3 using standard conditions to yield the ester 5. Selective reduction of the triple bond of 5 using Lindlar catalyst under hydrogen gives the intermediate 6, which upon thermal cyclization at about 185°C, followed by base treatment, gives the intermediate 7. The ester 7 is subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of platinum oxide to generate the intermediate saturated carboxylic acid, treatment of which with oxalyl chloride gives the corresponding acid chloride which is converted to the aldehyde lla by reduction using tributyltin hydride in the presence of Palladium catalyst.<br>
Dienoic acids of formula 3 are commercially available or are readily prepared.<br>
Aldehydes of formula II also can be prepared by a thiopyran ring opening, for example compounds of formula lla as defined above can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme. Scheme 2:<br><br><br><br>
The alkyne of formula 4, is reduced to the alkene 13 using Lindiar catalyst under hydrogen. The alkene 13 is esterified with the dienoic acid of formula 12 using standard conditions to yield the ester 14. Thermal cyclization at about 185°C, followed by base treatment, gives the intermediate 15. The ester 15 is converted to the intermediate carboxylic acid, and the double bond is reduced by hydrogenation in the presence of a platinum catalyst. The acid is then treated with oxalyl chloride to obtain the corresponding acid chloride, which is converted to the aldehyde 18 by reduction using tributyltin hydride in the presence of Palladium catalyst. The aldehyde moiety on 18 is treated with a reducing agent such as NaBH4, and the sulfur-containing ring is then opened by treatment with a reagent such as Raney nickel to obtain the alcohol 19. The alcohol is then oxidized to the aldehyde, Ha, using tetrapropyiammonium perruthenate (TPAP) in the presence of 4-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO).<br>
Phosphonates of formula III wherein W is aryl or R21-aryl can be prepared by a process similar to that described immediately below for preparing the trifluoromethy-phenyl-substituted compound, Ilia.<br><br><br>
Commercially available hydroxypyridine derivative is converted to the corresponding triflate using triflic anhydride, which is then coupled with commercially available boronic acid in the presence of Pd(0) under Suzuki conditions. The resulting product is converted to the phosphonate by treatment with n-butyllithium followed by quenching with diethylchlorophosphonate.<br>

For example, 3-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine is treated with triisopropylsilyl chloride, and the resultant hydroxy-protected compound is converted to the phosphonate as described above for preparing intermediate Ilia. The triisopropylsilyl-protected intermediate is then reacted with intermediate II and the protecting group is removed under standard conditions. The resultant compound of formula I wherein W is OH is then treated with triflic anhydride at room temperature in a solvent such as CH2CI2; the triflate is then reacted with an optionally substituted arylboronic acid,<br>

Peptide Protein Res. 45:145-151 (1995)) from 20 units of platelet concentrates obtained from the North Jersey Blood Center (East Orange, NJ) within 48 hours of collection. All steps were carried out at 4° C under approved biohazard safety conditions. Platelets were centrifuged at 100 x g for 20 minutes at 4° C to remove red cells. The supematants were decanted and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 15 minutes to pellet platelets. Platelets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, to a total volume of 200 ml and centrifuged at 4400 x g for 10 minutes. This step was repeated two additional times.

Thrombin receptor antagonists were screened using a modification of the thrombin receptor radioligand binding assay of Ahn et al. (Ahn et al, Mol. Pharmacol,, 51:350-356 (1997)). The assay was performed in 96 well Nunc plates (Cat. No. 269620) at a final assay volume of 200 fjl Platelet membranes and [3H]haTRAP were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml and 22.2 nM, respectively, in bindTng buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCI2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA). Stock solutions (10 mM in 100%<br>
DMSO) of test compounds were further diluted in 100% DMSO. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 //I of diluted compound solutions and 90 //I of radioligand (a final concentration of 10 nM in 5% DMSO) were added to each well, and the reaction was started by the addition of 100 pi of membranes (40 /jg protein/well). The binding was not significantly inhibited by 5% DMSO. Compounds were tested at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 pM). The plates were covered and vortex-mixed gently on a Lab-Line Titer Plate Shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Packard UniFilter GF/C filter plates were soaked for at least 1 hour in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The incubated membranes were harvested using a Packard FilterMate Universal Harvester and were rapidly washed four times with 300 /yl ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCfe, 1 mM EGTA. MicroScint 20 scintillation cocktail (25//I) was<br>
added to each well, and the plates were counted in a Packard TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter. The specific binding was defined as the total binding minus the nonspecific binding observed in the presence of excess (50 /jM) unlabeled haTRAP. The % inhibition by a compound of [3H]haTRAP binding to thrombin receptors was calculated from the following relationship: % Inhibition^<br>

Protocol For Ex-Vivo Platelet Aggregation In Cvnomolaus Whole Blood Drug administration and blood collection:<br>
Conscious chaired cynomolgus monkeys are allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. A needle catheter is inserted into a brachial vein for infusion of test drugs. Another needle catheter is inserted into the other brachial or saphenous vein and used for blood sampling. In those experiments where the compound is administered orally only one catheter is used. A baseline blood sample (1-2 ml) is collected in vacutainer tubes containing a thrombin inhibitor CVS 2139 (100//g/0.1 ml saline) as an anticoaculant. The drug is then infused intravenously over a period of 30 min. Blood samples (1 ml) are collected at 5, 10, 20, 30 min during and 30, 60, 90 min after termination of the drug infusion. In PO experiments the animals are dosed with the drug using a gavage cannula. Blood samples are collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 min after dosing. 0.5 ml of the blood is used for whole blood aggregation and the other 0.5 ml is used for determining the plasma concentration of the drug or its metabolites. Aggregation is performed immediately after collection of the blood sample as described below. Whole Blood Aggregation:<br>
A 0.5 ml blood sample is added to 0.5 ml of saline and warmed to 370c in a Chronolog whole blood aggregometer. Simultaneously, the impedance electrode is warmed in saline to 37°C The blood sample with a stir bar is place in the heating block well, the impedance electrode is placed in the blood sample and the collection software is started. The software is allowed to run until the baseline is stabilized and then a 20 &amp; calibration check is performed. 20 SI is equal to 4 blocks on the graphic produced by the computer software. The agonist (haTRAP) is added by an adjustable volume pipette (5-25 JJ\) and the aggregation curve is recorded for 10 minutes. Maximum aggregation in 6 minutes following agonist is the value recorded. In vitro Platelet Aggregation Procedure:<br>
Platelet aggregation studies were performed according to the method of Bednar etai (Bednar, BM Condra, C, Gould, R.J., and Connolly, T.M., T.hrom. Res., 77:453-463 (1995)). Blood was obtained from healthy human subjects who were aspirin free for at least 7 days by venipuncture using ACD as anticoagulant. Platelet rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 100Xg for 15 minutes at 15 deg C. Platelets were pelleted at 3000xg and washed twice in buffered saline containing 1 mM EGTA and 20//g/ml apyrase to inhibit aggregation. Aggregation was performed at room temperature in buffered saline supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml human fibrinogen. Test compound and platelets were preincubated in 96-well flat-bottom<br><br>
plates for 60 minutes. Aggregation was initiated by .adding 0.3 µM haTRAP or 0.1 U/ml thrombin and rapidly vortexing the mixture using a Lab Line Titer Plate Shaker (speed 7). Percent aggregation was monitored as increasing light transmittance at 405 nm in a Spectromax Plate Reader. In vivo Antitumor Procedure:<br>
Tests in the human breast carcinoma model in nude mouse are conducted according to the procedure reported in S. Even-Ram et. aL, Nature Medicine. 4&gt; 8 (1988), p. 909-914. Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Binding to the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor was carried out using the procedure of Showalter, et al (1996, J. Pharmacol ExpTher. 278(3), 989-99), with minor modifications. All assays were carried out in a final volume of 100 ul. Test compounds were resuspended to 10 mM in DMSO, then serially diluted in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.1, 3 mM MgCI2, 1 mM EDTA, 50% DMSO. Aliquots (10 ul) of each diluted -sample were then transferred into individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Membranes from human CB2 transfected CHO/Ki cells (Receptor Biology, Inc) were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.1, 3 mM MgCI2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 % fatty acid free bovine serum albumin), then added to the binding reaction (-15 ug in 50 ul per assay). The reactions were initiated with the addition of [3H] CP-55,940 diluted in binding buffer (specific activity = 180 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.). The final ligand concentration in the binding reaction was 0.48 nM. Following incubation at room temperature for 2 hours, membranes were harvested by filtration through pretreated (0.5% polyethylenimine; Sigma P-3143) GF-C filter plates (Unifiiter-96, Packard) using aTomTec Mach 3U 96-well cell harvester (Hamden, Ct). Plates were washed 10 times in 100 ul binding buffer, and the membranes allowed to air dry. Radioactivity on membranes was quantitated following addition of Packard Omniscint 20 scintillation fluid using a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Packard, Meriden, Ct). Non-linear regression analysis was performed using Prism 20b. (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Ca),<br>
