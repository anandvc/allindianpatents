COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A process for the preparation of a 3, 4-disubstituted -l-(4-substituted-2-fluorophenyl-l,2,4-triazolin-5-one compound of Formula I"<br>
FMC CORPORATION, of 1735 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19103, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/098,060, filed August 27, 1998.<br>
The present invention relates generally to processes for preparing l-(2-fluorophenyl)-substituted triazolinones.  In particular, it pertains to the fiuorination of the phenyl ring of 4,5-dihydro-l-(4-substituted phenyl)-3,4-disubtituted-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-ones.<br>
The 4,5-dihydro-l-(2-fluoro substituted phenyl)-3,4-disubtituted-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-ones, for example 4,5-dihydro-l-(4-cM'oro'2-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-4--diflupromethyl-l,'2,4-triazol-5(lH)-one, are critical intermediates in the manufacture of fine chemicals, such as pesticides.  For example, 4,5-dihydro-l-(4-chloro-2-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-4-difluoromethyl-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-one is a known intermediate in the manufacture of the herbicide ethyl a-2-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyI-5-oxo-lH-l,2,4-triazol-lyl]-4-fluorobenzenepropanoate.<br>
Fiuorination of complex aromatic systems is difficult because of fluorine's high reactivity. As a result, there are only a few practical commercial methods by which fluorine can be introduced regioselectively into complex aromatic systems.<br>
One method of fiuorination includes the Balz-Schiemann reaction in which an aromatic ring is fluorinated by the thermal decomposition of diazonium fluoroborates.  This method has failed to provide the desired product in appreciable yield.<br>
Another method for the preparation of fluorinated complex aromatic systems, in particular phenyl-substituted triazolinones, includes the use of 2-fluoroaniline or 2-fluorophenylhydrazine as<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 00/12490	_P£IZL—<br>
starting materials for the preparation of a corresponding l-(2-fluorophenyl)-substituted triazolinones thereby avoiding the difficult task of fluorinating adeactivated aromatic ring. These procedures provide low synthetic yields.<br>
Electrophilic NF fluorinating agents have been used to directly fluorinate mono substituted and disubstituted aromatics to provide mixtures of the ortho- and para- fluoro-phenyl substituted compounds.  (J/^yem. Soc, Chem. Commun., 1992, pg. 595-596) Substantially isomerically pure para-fluoro-trisubstituted aromatic rings have been prepared with this procedure when at least one of the substituents of the disubstituted aromatic starting material is electron donating. This procedure has not been applied to the preparation of l-(2-fluoro-4-subsu^ted-pnhenyJ)-3,4«disubstituted triazolinones.<br>
There remains a need for a simple and generally high yielding method for the preparation of the key synthetic intermediates l-(2-fiuoro-4-substituted-phenyl)-3,4-disubstituted triazolinones in substantially isomerically pure or isomerically enriched form using l-(4-substituted-phenyl)-3,4-disubstituted triazolinones as starting materials.<br>

ENTAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The yields of the present process depend, among other things, upon the temperature at which the treatment is conducted, the mode, rate or order of addition into a reaction vessel of the<br>
-5-<br><br><br>
fluorinating agent and the compound of the Formula II, the molar ratio of the fluorinating agent to the compound of the Formula II, or the solvent employed or a catalyst employed.<br>
The process of the present invention can be run at temperatures ranging from about 60° C to a temperature which is at or below the boiling point of the organic solvent(s) used. The optimal temperature for running the fluorination reaction will depend, among other things, upon the organic solvent or combination of organic solvents used to run the reaction. The optimal temperature will generally range from about 60° to about 120° C, preferably from about 80° to about 115° C, more preferably from about 80° to about 85° C.<br>
The modifier "about" is usedherein to indicate tha|_certain<br>
preferred operating ranges, such as material amounts and temperature, and ranges thereof, are not fixedly determined• JTfre meaning will often be apparent to one of ordinary skill. For example, a recitation of a temperature range of about 60° C to about 120° C in reference to, for example, the aforementioned fluorination reaction would be interpreted to include other like temperatures which can be expected to favor a useful rate of reaction, such as, for example, 54° C or 132° C. Where guidance from the experience of those of ordinary skill is lacking, guidance from the context is lacking, and where a more specific rule is not recited below, the "about" range shall be not more than 10% of the absolute value of an end point or 15% of the range recited, whichever is less.<br><br><br>
Fluorinating agents that may be used in accordance with the present invention are electrophilic NF reagents and xenon difluoride. NF reagents are electrophilic fluorinating agents that contain a fluorine atom bound to a nitrogen atom which is part of an organic compound.  NF reagents serve as F4 transfer agents.^a€^F fluorinating reagents used in the present invention can include those described by LaTet al. {Chem. Rev., 1996, 96, 1737^1.755), Lai (J. Org. Chem, 1993, 58, 2791-2796), and Banks et al. (J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. 1992, 595-596), the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of electrophilic NF reagents include but are not limited to fluorine triethylenediamine (F-TEDA), N-fluoro-o^b^nzenesulfonimi.de,^and N-fluoro-2-pyridone.<br>
/<br><br><br>
The electrophilic NF reagent can include any of the following:<br><br><br><br><br>

In a particular embodiment, the fluorinating agent is fluorine triethylenediamine.<br>
The fluorinating agent can be added to the fluorination reaction mixture in a single portion, in at least two portions, or continuously as either a solid or solution containing the fluorinating agent.  For example, the fluorinating agent can be added as a powdered solid in two or more portions, or it can be added continuously to the fluorination reaction, as a solution or suspension comprising an organic solvent and the fluorinating agent, by way of a syringe, peristaltic or metering pump. The amount, in terms of<br>
-8-<br><br>
molar equivalents, of fluorinating agent in each aliquot or portion can be varied as desired.<br>
The process of the invention can be run at ambient to elevated pressure or generally from about atmospheric pressure or 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. The fluorination reaction can be accelerated by increasing the pressure under which the reaction is run.<br>
The process of the invention is run for a period of time sufficient to form the compound of the ForrnulajT-^Fhe-fl«©i4na4aon reaction time preferably ranges from about 4 to about 72 hours for completion, more preferably from about 6 to about 48 hours, and can vary according to the reaction temperature, the solvent employed, the presence or absence of a catalyst, the structure of the compound of the Formula I, the fluorinating agent employed and other factors.  For example, the fluorination reaction is generally faster when R' is hydrogen than when R' is difluoromethyl.<br>
The concentration of a compound of the Formula II in the reaction solvent can range from about 5 % to about 25%. preferably from about 10% to about 25%, more preferably from about 15% to about 20% by weight, based upon the final weight of the reaction mixture.  Generally, about 5 to about 50, preferably about 10 to about 30, volumes mL or L of solvent per g or Kg, respectively, of the compound of the Formula II are used.<br>
The compound of the Formula I can be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified according to the methods disclosed in Example 1 or according to other methods known to those of skill in the art.  For example, the solvent can be evaporated or otherwise removed from the reaction mixture to form a residue, and the<br><br><br>
compound of the Formula I can be isolated from the resulting residue by vacuum distillation or sublimation.<br>

4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-l-phenyl-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-one<br>
The following procedure is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,980,480.<br>
Chlorine gas was bubbled into a solution of 17.7 g (0.1 mol) of 3-methyl-l-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolidin-5-one in.about 10 times its weight of glacial acetic acid at room temperature for 5 minutes. The temperature rose to 35° C, and the brown solution became lighter in cofor.  WMR analysis showed that the product was 4,5-di'hydro-3-methyl-l-phenyl-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)one. Next 1.0 g of iron powder was slowly added to the mixture which was then heated to 95° C. Chlorine gas was bubbled into it for 10 minutes, after which it was maintained at the elevated temperature for one hour while stirring. The mixture was then dumped into ice, extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over magnesium sulfate and passed through a column of silica gel (which was then eluted with 200 ml of ethyl acetate to give a solution from which the solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure), giving 12.0 g of a solid (m.p. 174°-176° C), 4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-i-(4-chlorophenyl)-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-one. The H1 NMR spectrum of the product was consistent with that of a reference sarnple.<br>
