"A PROCESS OF PREPARING A TETRAHYDROTHIOPYRAN-O-FLUORINATED<br>
CARBAMATE"<br>
PHARMACIA   8s   UPJOHN   COMPANY,   a   Delaware   Corporation,   301 Henrietta Street, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001, USA,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present, invention relates to a process, of preparing a tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated carbamate.<br>
The invention is a process for the preparation of cyclic-sulfur fluorine containing oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art Many processes are known for producing pharmaceutically antibacterial oxazolidinones, see for example, International Publication WO97/37980. However, when the the oxazolidinone contains an o-halogen substituted phenyl ring, decomposition of the metallated benzene to a reactive benzyne is a known undesirable side reaction, see "Dehydrobenzene and Cycloalkynes" by R.W. Hoffmann, Academic Press, N.Y., 1967. The " process of the present invention produces a tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated oxazolidinones intermediate (TV) which is useful in producing antibacterially active oxazolidinones (XIV), (XIX) and N-[[(5S)-3-[3-fluoro-4-(tetrahydro- l-oxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)-phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazoIidinyl]methyl]ethanethioamide.<br>
International Publication WO97/09328 discloses tetrahydrottaopyran-o-fluorinated<br>
oxaxolidinones   which   are" produced  by   a  process  which   requires   much  colder temperatures than the claimed invention.<br>
International Publication WO97/30995 discloses tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated oxaxolidinones which are produced by a process different that that of the present invention.<br>

(1) contacting a 4-bromo-3-fluorinated carbamate of formula (II)<br><br><br><br><br>
where Rester is as defined above, with a Grignard reagent of the formula R-Mg-X where R is Ci-C4 alkyl, CH2=CH-, CH2=CH-CH2-, cyclohexyl or phenyl and where X is -Br, -CI or -I;<br>
(2)	contacting the product of step (1) with an alkyl lithium base and<br>
(3)	contacting the product of step (2) with tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one (131).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The proces of the present invention is the reaction of the 4-bromo-3-fluorinated carbamate (II) with tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one (III) to produce a tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated compound (IV). The tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated compound (IV) is a key intermediate to making oxazolidinone antibacterial agents which contain the tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated group.<br>
The process starts with a 4-bromo-3-fluorinated carbamate (II). Operable Rester<br>
groups include:	<br>
(I) C1-C10 alkyl optionally substituted with:<br>
(A)	phenyl,<br>
(B)	1 thru 3 C1-C3 alkoxy,<br>
(II) C2-C5 alkenyl optionally substituted with:<br><br>
(A)	phenyl,<br>
(B)	C3-C7 cycloalkyl,<br>
(HI) phenyl and optionally substituted with one thru three C1-C3 alkyl and, (IV) naphthyl optionally substituted with one thru three C1-C3 alkyL It is preferred that Rester be C1-C6 alkyl or -CH2-; it is more preferred that Rester be i-butyl.<br>
The first step of the process requires that the 4-bromo-3-fluorinated carbamate (II) be reacted with a Grignard reagent of the formula R-Mg-X where R is C1-C4 alkyl, CH2=CH-, CH2=CH-CH2-, cyclohexyl or phenyl and where X is -Br, -Cl or -I. It is preferred that R is C1-C3 alkyl or phenyl; it is more preferred that R be ethyl. It is preferred that X be -Br. This reaction is performed in the usual manner for Grignard reactions which is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Step (2) is the reaction of the mixture from step (1) with an alkyl lithium base. It is preferred that the alkyl lithium base is selected from the group consisting of methyllithium, n-butyllithium, s-butyllithium and t-butyllithium. Step (2) should be performed at a temperature of less than about -15°; it is preferred that step (2) be performed at a temperature range of about -15 to about -35°, more preferably in the range of about -20 to about-35°. It is preferred that both step (1) and step (2) be performed in the prsence of 3 equivalents of N,N,N",N"-tetramethylethylenediamine.<br>
Step (3) of the process is contacting the product of step (2) with the tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one (III) to produce the desired tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated compound (IV).<br>
It is preferred where the product of step (2) is contacted with a compound of the<br>
formula MgQ2 prior to contacting with the tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one (III), where Q is -Cl -Br or -I and where the two Qs can be the same or different prior to performing step (3). It is preferred that the two Qs be different and be -Cl and -Br.<br><br>
The tetrahydrothiopyran-o-fluorinated compound (IV) is then converted to the following pharmaceutically useful antibacterial agents:<br>
[4(S)-cis]-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(tetrahydro-l-oxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide (IX) by the process of EXAMPLES 3 thru 6,<br>
[lα  ,4β (S)]-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(tetrahydro-l-oxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]propanamide monohydrate (XIV) by the process of EXAMPLES 7 thru 11 and to<br>
4(S)-N-[[3-[fluoro-4-(tetrahydro-1, l-dioxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolinyl]methyl]acetamide (XIX) by the process of EXAMPLES 12 thru 16.<br><br>
These three antibacterially active oxazolidinones are useful as pharmaceutical agents to treat various bacterial infections and/or diseases. For [4(S)-cis]-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(tetrahydro-l-oxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide (IX) see US Patent applications 60/100,185 (filed 98-9-14), 60/075,247 (filed 98-2-19) and 60/088,283 (filed 98-6-5). For [lα,4p(S)]-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(tetrahydro-l-oxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]propanamide monohydrate (XIV) see US patent application 08/696,313 (filed 96-8-13). For 4(S)-N-[[3-[fluoro-4-(tetrahydro-l,l-dioxido-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolinyl]methyl]acetamide (XIX) see US patent application 60/100,185.<br>
DEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS<br>
The definitions and explanations below are for the terms as used throughout this entire document including both the specification and the claims.<br>
I. CONVENTIONS FOR FORMULAS AND DEFINITIONS OF VARIABLES<br>
The carbon atom content of variable substituents is indicated in one of two ways. The first method uses a prefix to the entire name of the variable such as "C1-C4", where both "1" and "4" are integers representing the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the variable. The prefix is separated from the variable by a space. For example, "C1-C4 alkyl" represents alkyl of 1 through 4 carbon atoms, (including isomeric forms thereof unless an express indication to the contrary is given). Whenever this single prefix is given, the prefix indicates the entire carbon atom content of the variable being defined. Thus C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl describes a group CH3-(CH2)n-O-CO- where n is zero, one or two. By the second method the carbon atom content of only each portion of the definition is indicated separately by enclosing the "C1-Cj" designation in parentheses and placing it immediately (no intervening space) before the portion of the definition being defined. By this optional convention (C1-C3)alkoxycarbonyl has the same meaning as C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl because the "C1-C3" refers only to the carbon atom content of the alkoxy group. Similarly while both C2-C6 alkoxyalkyl and (C1-C3)alkoxy(C1-C3)alkyl define alkoxyalkyl groups containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, the two definitions differ since the former definition allows either the alkoxy or alkyl portion alone to contain 4 or 5 carbon atoms while the latter definition limits either of these groups to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
When the claims contain a fairly complex (cyclic) substituent, at the end of the phrase naming/designating that particular substituent will be a notation in (parentheses)<br><br>
which will correspond to the same name/designation in one of the CHARTS which will also set forth the chemical structural formula of that particular substituent.<br>

Saline refers to an aqueous saturated sodium chloride mixture.<br>
Chromatography (column and flash chromatography) refers to purification/separation of compounds expressed as (support, eluent). It is understood that the appropriate fractions are pooled and concentrated to give the desired compound(s).<br>

NMR refers to nuclear (proton) magnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemical shifts are reported in ppm (d) downfield from tetramethylsilane.<br>
TMS refers to trimethylsilyl  <br>
