				<td>MULTI-CARBIDE MATERIAL MANUFACTURE AND USE <br>
A METHOD FOR MILLING A PRODUCT IN A MEDIA MILL <br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS <br><br>
[01 ] This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/453,427 filed on March 11,2003 and entitled SPHERES IMPARTING HIGH WEAR<br>
RATES, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Â£02] This invention relates generally to the field of grinding media composition, and<br>
more specifically to multi-carbide materials for use as grinding media formed in the<br>
shape of spheres or other shaped media.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[03] Carbide materials are well known in the art of material science. They include a<br>
range of compounds composed of carbon and one or more carbide-forming elements such<br>
as chromium, hafnium, molybdenum, niobium, rhenium, tantalum, thallium, titanium,<br>
tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, and others. Carbides are known for their extreme<br>
hardness with high temperature tolerance, properties rendering them well-suited for<br>
applications as cutting tools, drilling bits, and similar uses. Multi-element carbides are<br>
known for their improved toughness and hardness relative to single element carbides.<br>
Single element carbides are typically used with a metal binder to impart toughness.<br>
[04] Multi-carbides are formed by combining two or more carbide-forming elements<br>
with carbon. Some multi-carbides have other non-carbide forming elements in the<br>
composition, such as nitrogen, but are here referred to simply as multi-carbides since the<br>
dominant components are carbide-forming elements. For example, a combination of<br>
tungsten and titanium with carbon and nitrogen would be such a multi-carbide material.<br>
Some multi-carbide compositions are formed with a deficiency of carbon resulting in<br>
some small percentage of carbide-forming element not being converted to a carbide and<br>
instead remaining as uncombined elemental metal. These combinations can enhance<br>
certain of the favorable qualities of carbides, with some combinations increasing<br>
hardness, others increasing toughness, and so forth. Very small variations in composition<br>
can greatly affect the material's properties. Many of these variations are well understood<br>
by practitioners of the art and are amply published.<br>
^J&amp;SJ Spheres and solid bodies of other specific shapes, whether of carbide or multi-<br>
carbide, are difficult to manufacture due to the very properties that make them useful.<br>
Their high melting point necessitates a powerful energy source with difficulty in<br>
temperature regulation and effect, and their hardness makes them costly to machine.<br>
[06] For example, a primary manufacturing method used to manufacture carbides is to<br>
place the elements to be fused on the recessed surface of a large electrode. A very high<br>
current is passed from that electrode through the material and into another electrode in<br>
proximity, subjecting the material to the heat of an electric arc. This process is effective<br>
in fusing the materials, but causes inconsistent mixing of the elements in the compound<br>
and some uncontrolled loss of material due to vaporization, phenomena that can greatly<br>
compromise the properties of the resulting compound in uncontrolled and unpredictable<br>
ways. Hardness is also a challenge, as the manufacturing process results in an<br>
irregularly-shaped lump of resulting compound that is generally a few inches in diameter,<br>
colorfully known as a "cow chip". The "chip" is very hard, and is worked into smaller<br>
shapes only by percussive shocking or other crushing method that cleaves the chip into<br>
useful sizes. These processes leave small cracks in the finished product that greatly<br>
reduce both its hardness and its mechanical toughness. Re-melting of the material after<br>
crushing imposes high cost, and cannot efficiently achieve regular particle sizes or<br>
shapes. Consequently, although carbide is available in small spheres and other preferred<br>
shapes, those spheres are not optimally composed, they are irregularly sized, they are<br>
expensive, and they are lacking in effectiveness.<br>
[07] The known art currently does not have a process whereby multi-carbide materials<br>
can be formed into small and regular shapes without loss of optimized properties due to<br>
process variation in manufacture or degradation of material during shaping.<br>
[08] Reducing of particles, also known as comminution, is a very old art, practiced for<br>
example by the ancients to produce flour from grain by stone wheel grinding. Later<br>
practices required smaller and more regular powders for a variety of industrial<br>
applications, and more refined techniques were developed to produce those products,<br>
such as media milling. Modern technologies and practices now demand ever-finer<br>
particles, measured in microns, thousandths of microns, and even angstroms; and with<br>
greater regularity of particle size and purity at these reduced dimensions.<br>
[09] Just as stone wheel grinding could not reliably provide the powders needed for<br>
earlier industrial processes, current media mills and similar technologies cannot reliably<br>
provide the ultra-fine and ultra-regular particles now required for certain applications.<br>
[010] Various methods for reducing the size of particles have been employed. Many<br>
use materials such as spheres, rods or more irregular objects ("grinding media") to crush<br>
or beat the material to be reduced ("product material") to smaller dimensions by<br>
processes known as grinding, milling, comminution, or dispersion. Grinding media range<br>
greatly in size, from ore crushers that are several inches in diameter, down to micron-<br>
sized particles that are themselves used to mill much smaller particles. Grinding media<br>
also vary greatly in shape, including spherical, semi-spherical, oblate spherical,<br>
cylindrical, diagonal, rods, and other shapes (hereinafter "shaped media"), and irregular<br>
natural shapes such as grains of sand.<br>
[011] Grinding media are used in various devices such ball mills, rod mills, attritor<br>
mills, stirred media mills, pebble mills, etc. Regardless of their differences in design, all<br>
mills operate by distributing product material around the grinding media and by causing<br>
collisions to occur between grinding media units such that product material particles are<br>
positioned between the colliding grinding media units. These collisions cause fracturing<br>
of product material particles into to smaller dimensions, an effect known descriptively as<br>
"size reduction" or "comminution."<br>
[012] The materials used as grinding media also are frequently used as applied<br>
abrasives. For example, such materials are aggregated in molds and held together by a<br>
binder such as molten metal that is poured into the mold and cooled, rendering a "hard<br>
body" that is impregnated by the binder material. Hard body materials (also known as<br>
"hard bodies") of this kind are used in deep-well drilling and other applications. Similar<br>
processes are used to impregnate the materials in grinding discs and wheels. Various<br>
adhesives are used to bind the materials to textiles, papers and other strata for use as<br>
sandpapers, sanding belts, and similar products.<br>
[013] Different grinding and milling techniques produce different mean product<br>
material particle sizes and uniformity. Gross differences in result are obtained primarily<br>
as a function of the size and shape of the grinding media. Large grinding media produce<br>
relatively large and irregular product material particles that are suitable for coarse<br>
processes or for further refinement by finer processes. Small grinding media can be used<br>
to produce finer and more regular materials as an end in itself, or to alter crystallite<br>
aggregates, or to cause mechanochemical alloying, or some combination thereof. Small<br>
grinding media are also used for polishing, burnishing, and deburring. Mills are<br>
sometimes used in series, with progressively smaller grinding media employed to further<br>
reduce product material particle size in stages. Variation of the shape of the grinding<br>
media generally affects the regularity of particle size, the efficiency of the milling<br>
process, the total cost to achieve a given size reduction, and other factors. These effects<br>
generally are well known in the art.<br>
[014] Extremely small particle sizes are proving to be useful for many new applications,<br>
however, the size reduction and regularity necessary for standardized, acceptable results<br>
cannot be achieved by any current milling methods. Production now requires alternate<br>
particle fabrication methods such as chemical precipitation, either at a fast rate with<br>
unacceptable process variation, or at very slow rates, with unacceptable time and<br>
expense.<br>
[015] Other important effects are obtained by varying the composition of the grinding<br>
media itself. Three material properties dominantly affect grinding media performance:<br>
hardness, mass density, and mechanical toughness. Hardness of the grinding medium<br>
determines milling effectiveness, mass density determines milling efficiency, while<br>
mechanical toughness determines product purity and overall process efficiency. Hard<br>
materials transfer energy efficiently in collisions with product material for effective<br>
milling, high-density materials increase the energy transfer per collision with product<br>
material and thus increase milling efficiency, especially for small-dimension grinding<br>
media, and tough materials can be used for longer periods before they fail and<br>
contaminate the product material or otherwise require replacement. An ideal milling<br>
material is thus very hard, of very high mass density, and very tough. Preferably, those<br>
qualities will hold as the size of the grinding media is reduced, and regardless of the<br>
chosen shape of the grinding media.<br>
[016] The history of engineering materials for grinding media is a history of accepting<br>
tradeoffs among these material properties, as improvement in one of these factors has<br>
previously produced an offsetting reduction in one or more of the others. For example,<br>
yttria-stabilized zirconia shows good mechanical toughness, but with low mass density.<br>
Various metal media have relatively high mass density, but low mechanical toughness.<br>
Carbides showed extreme hardness and mass density, even in small dimensions, but with<br>
unavoidable media failures that cause unacceptable product contamination and more<br>
general process failures that are incompatible with many applications.<br>
[017] U.S. Patent No. 5,4_07,564 (Kaliski) is illustrative. Kaliski discloses a range of<br>
high mass density, single-element carbides selected from tungsten, thallium, niobium,<br>
and vanadium in sizes ranging between 10 and 100 microns with a requirement of high<br>
theoretical density. As Kaliski explains, high theoretical density, nonporous materials are<br>
needed. These materials showed impressive results in producing fine and regular product<br>
material in small quantities under controlled laboratory conditions. Duplication of his<br>
example showed his invention to cause contamination of the milled product, as longer-<br>
term and higher-volume production attempts failed due to lack of mechanical toughness<br>
that caused metallic and other contamination of product material. High density ceramics<br>
without metal binders, such as tungsten carbide combined with tungsten di-carbide, also<br>
are disclosed by Kaliski as a means to obtain high milling efficiency but with<br>
contamination of product material from the grinding media. Kaliski specifically<br>
recommends choosing among his claimed materials to select those whose contaminants<br>
provide the most good, or at least do the least damage, to the milled product. These<br>
materials changed the nature of but did not resolve the product material contaminant<br>
issue, and did not solve the mechanical toughness problem. Rather, these materials<br>
tended to fail by degradation into hard, fine and irregular shards that acted as abrasives in<br>
the media mill, contaminating the product and on one occasion seriously damaging the<br>
mill itself.<br>
[018] U.S. Patent No. 5,704,556 (McLaughlin) discloses ceramic grinding media<br>
without metal binders in dimensions of less than 100 microns diameter. While these<br>
materials are acceptably hard, and show greater mechanical toughness than those<br>
disclosed in Kaliski, they lack adequate density for many applications or for optimum<br>
efficiency in others.<br>
[019] The inventor of the present invention made an effort to make suitable grinding<br>
media from available spherical carbides, of which only single element carbides are<br>
known in the art. Tungsten carbide/tungsten di-carbide spheres were purchased in<br>
conformance to Kaliski's specification and used in a shaker mill, but comminution to the<br>
degree cited by Kaliski was not evident. Plasma-processed spherical tungsten<br>
carbide/tungsten di-carbide was also purchased from another source, in conformance to<br>
Kaliski's specification, in sufficient quantity to test on a production scale. This grinding<br>
media fractured due to insufficient mechanical toughness, contaminating the product and<br>
extensively damaging the media mill. Tungsten carbide failed due to the lack of<br>
mechanical toughness despite experimental variation of media velocity, flow rate,<br>
material volume, and other milling variables. Grinding media material in conformance to<br>
Kaliski's specification was obtained from several difference sources worldwide, but<br>
differences in sourcing produced no significant difference in results. In all attempts with<br>
all materials supplied to the Kaliski specification, the level of product contamination was<br>
a limitation on usefulness.<br>
[020] U.S. Patent No. 2,581,414 (Hochberg), U.S. PatentNo.5,478,705(Czekai), and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,518,187 (Bruno) disclose polymer grinding media which show high<br>
mechanical toughness and cause relatively benign product material contamination upon<br>
grinding media failure. However, they show low hardness and density relative to<br>
ceramics. Polymer grinding media thus can be useful in milling relatively soft product<br>
materials that are sensitive to product contamination, and in industries that are relatively<br>
insensitive to processing cost, such as in drug processing or in dispersing biological cells<br>
for analysis, but they are not appropriate for the majority of industrial applications.<br>
[021] U.S. Patent Nos. 3,690,962, 3,737,289, 3,779,745, and 4,066,451 (all to Rudy)<br>
disclose certain multi-carbides for use as cutting tools. Although the multi-carbides<br>
disclosed showed a combination of hardness, density and mechanical toughness that<br>
promised to be useful for milling, the known geometries for available multi-carbide<br>
materials rendered them incompatible with such use. Difficulties included the large size<br>
of multi-carbide material that is produced by current manufacturing methods, and<br>
difficulty in machining or otherwise manipulating the material into sizes and shapes<br>
useful for milling due in part to its hardness and mechanical toughness.<br>

Materials," Poroshkovaya Metallurgiya, No. 2 (218), 53-58, (1981) teach how sensitive<br>
the properties of single element carbides can be to small additions of other carbide<br>
forming elements. This fact has greatly inhibited research into multi-carbide elements.<br>
[023] As summarized above, the grinding media of the prior art all suffer some<br>
technical disadvantage resulting in a proliferation of grinding media materials creating a<br>
significant economic burden and also resulting in technically inferior milled products due<br>
to contamination.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[058] According to the present invention, a compound is formed from a combination of<br>
carbon and two or more different carbide-forming elements ("multi-carbide material",<br>
defined more fully below). Multi-carbide materials have extreme hardness, extreme<br>
density, and extreme mechanical toughness. In the present invention, the selection of<br>
carbide-forming elements of the multi-carbide materials, and the precise proportional<br>
composition for any combination of those elements, is modified to alter the properties of<br>
the material. Multi-carbide material is combined with one or more elemental metals of<br>
the chosen carbide to alter ductility and other properties of the material. Multi-carbide<br>
material is formed effectively and efficiently into a variety of shaped media, preferably<br>
into spheres, by the use of novel manufacturing methods.<br>
[039] The manufacturing method of the present invention maintains proper element<br>
composition to optimize desired material properties, produces useful shaped media,<br>
avoids crushing or other degradation of the material to create said shaped media, and<br>
greatly lowers manufacturing cost to produce shaped media formed from such material<br>
while improving the quality of the material obtained. The manufacturing method<br>
produces small and regular spheres of optimized multi-carbide material that is suitable for<br>
use as grinding media in media mills ("multi-carbide grinding media"). The multi-<br>
carbide grinding media of the present invention are used in shaped media ranging in size<br>
from 100 mm or more down to 0.5 microns or less while maintaining their effective<br>
material properties. The multi-carbide grinding media are used in media mills and other<br>
extant milling processes of varying design and capacity. By such use of such multi-<br>
carbide grinding media, greater product material size reduction, size regulation, and<br>
purity can be achieved than by utilization of extant milling media materials.<br>
[040] Such use improves the efficiency and outcome of current particle size reduction<br>
methods. Less effective methods could be used as preliminary process steps to produce<br>
particles of relatively great size and irregularity, with those particles being further refined<br>
by the invention.<br>
[041] The multi-carbide grinding media of the present invention are used effectively in<br>
a variety of applications other than media mills, such as the manufacture of hard bodies,<br>
grinding wheels, abrasive papers and textiles, cladding materials, and hard coating<br>
materials.<br>
[042] The invention permits the manufacture of materials in dimensions and purities<br>
that previously were unattainable ("ultra-fine particles"). Ultra-fine particles will enable<br>
the manufacture of products previously unattainable, or attainable only by less effective<br>
or more expensive methods. Examples include sub-micron sized oxides, such as oxides<br>
of titanium. Reduction of certain oxides of titania with sufficiently low impurities causes<br>
that compound to exhibit special properties including high transparency. Fine size<br>
reduction of pigments improve the efficiency of color distribution in dyes and paints.<br>
Similar results are obtained by high refinement of varnishes and other finishes. Ultra-fine<br>
particles of certain metals and other materials, such as cobalt, hydrides, molybdenum,<br>
nitrides, titanium, tungsten, and various alloys and other compounds of the same, will<br>
permit the manufacture of those materials at previously-unachieved economic or<br>
performance properties and in superalloy and other combinations not previously<br>
obtainable. Diamond particles can be reduced to dimensions not previously obtainable<br>
due to their hardness relative to known grinding media, permitting more efficient use of<br>
diamond particles at reduced cost. Ultra-fine particles will become available that can be<br>
formed by molding, electrostatic deposition and other known methods into<br>
microelectromechanical products and other micron-scale devices that previously were<br>
obtainable only by etching of glass or silicon or other semiconductors. Ultra-fine<br>
particles can be introduced to certain liquids to form fluids that exhibit special properties<br>
of heat transmission, solubility and other qualities.<br>
[043] Through use of the invention, samples produced either by more coarse milling or<br>
by high-rate precipitation are further refined through milling process with multi-carbide<br>
grinding media to preferred specifications at high speed and relatively low cost. Other<br>
valuable materials are made uniquely possible by the claimed methods of the invention.<br>
[044] The invention also permits the manufacture of ultra-fine particles with geometries<br>
superior to those achieved by known manufacturing methods. Por example, chemical<br>
precipitation can create particles of certain materials in extremely small dimensions.<br>
Those particles, however, generally exhibit smooth and rounded shapes. Fig. 1 shows<br>
particles that were assembled atomistically by precipitation. Such particles are also<br>
typical of those particles produced by known means such as sol gel, vapor phase<br>
condensation, etc. The science dealing with the surface topography of particles speaks in<br>
terms of a fractured surface which has discernible cleavage facets and cleavage steps.<br>
These two features are specifically absent from the particles produced by the known<br>
processing methods for producing very small particles. Another missing feature in<br>
particles produced according to prior art methods is concavity. Concavity is defined as<br>
that condition where some portion of the surface lies beneath the surrounding surface. In<br>
precipitated particles, the surface is bulbulous, meaning that a portion of the surface<br>
protrudes above the surrounding surface such as is always true in the case of a sphere.<br>
[045] As shown in Fig. 2, ultra-fine particles produced by milling according to the<br>
present invention exhibit more angular geometries with cleaved surfaces and angular<br>
intersecting surfaces that exhibit higher activity relative to the materials formed by other<br>
means, causing ultra-fine milled particles to tend to exhibit superior chemical and<br>
mechanical properties over particles of similar size and dimension that are manufactured<br>
by precipitation and similar methods. Note the corners, flat edges, etc. of the very small<br>
particles produced by the milling method of the present invention.<br>
[046] A catalyst produced according to the present invention is less than 30 x 10"9<br>
meters in all dimensions and possesses cleaved surfaces, the catalyst being uniquely<br>
distinguishable by its particle surface features having a preponderance of cleavage facets<br>
and/or cleavage steps, the catalyst alternatively being uniquely distinguishable by the<br>
acutance of a preponderance of intersecting surfaces in which the arc length of the edge is<br>
less than the radius of the edge, the catalyst alternatively being uniquely distinguishable<br>
by surface concavities greater than 5% of the particle diameter, the catalyst alternatively<br>
being uniquely distinguishable by the acutance of a preponderance of intersecting<br>
surfaces in which the included angle of the edge radius is about, or less than, the included<br>
angle of the intersecting surfaces.<br>
[047] Intermetallic particles produced according to the present invention have less than<br>
30 x 10" meters in all dimensions and possess cleaved surfaces. The product is uniquely<br>
distinguishable by its particle surface features having a preponderance of cleavage facets<br>
and/or cleavage steps, the product alternatively being uniquely distinguishable by the<br>
acutance of a preponderance of intersecting surfaces in which the arc length of the edge is<br>
less than the radius of the edge, the catalyst alternatively being uniquely distinguishable<br>
by surface concavities greater than 5% of the particle diameter, the product alternatively<br>
being uniquely distinguishable by the acutance of a preponderance of intersecting<br>
surfaces in which the included angle of the edge radius is about, or less than, the included<br>
angle of the intersecting surfaces.<br>
[048] The grinding media of the present invention are also useful in other fields.<br>
Examples include the manufacture of "hard bodies" for drilling or grinding, laser<br>
cladding and other cladding processes, use as surface materials, and other applications.<br>
For instance, grinding media are used without media mills as a component of alloys to be<br>
applied to surfaces for improved wear resistance. Two common methods of applying<br>
such protective coatings are known as cladding and surfacing. Each of these have many<br>
methods employed, the choice of which depending on the object and alloy to be treated.<br>
Generically, binder materials such as polymers or metals are used to hold grinding media<br>
onto the surface of the object being treated by cladding or surfacing. The binder<br>
materials are melted or cast into place along with the grinding media material which itself<br>
is not melted during the cladding or surfacing operation. Typical melting methods<br>
include laser, furnace melting, welding tubes and plasma heat sources. When in use, the<br>
binder material itself often cannot withstand the wear imposed on the surface by the<br>
operating environment such as in oil well drilling. This binder wear exposes the grinding<br>
media to the surface, thereby providing a wear resisting surface protection. These same<br>
surfaces are often exposed to very high shock impacts which the grinding media is able to<br>
withstand.<br>
[049] To create multi-carbide grinding media, a compound ("multi-carbide material") is<br>
formed from carbon and at least two carbide-forming elements. U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,690,962, 3,737,289, 3,779,745, and 4,066,451 (all to Rudy), incorporated herein by<br>
reference, disclose how to make such multi-carbide materials for use as cutting tools.<br>
[050] In an embodiment of the invention, the multi-carbide material is formed from<br>
carbon and carbide-forming elements selected from the group consisting of chromium,<br>
hafnium, molybdenum, niobium, rhenium, tantalum, thallium, titanium, tungsten,<br>
vanadium, zirconium, and any other carbide forming element. Multi-carbide material can<br>
be formed either with or without some of the carbide-forming elements not being fully<br>
carburized and thus remaining in the material in its elemental state. The multi-carbide<br>
material can contain a certain amount of impurities and other extraneous elements<br>
without significantly affecting its material properties.<br>
[051] The production of spheres from irregular shaped particles can be achieved by<br>
various means. One common method of processing ultrahigh melting point materials into<br>
spheres is with the use of a thermal plasma torch. Such a torch can operate at<br>
temperatures well beyond the melting point of all multi-carbide materials. Other<br>
methods, such as melt atomization or arc melting, are known to those familiar with the art<br>
and there is no intention to limit the practice to just the use of these named methods. In<br>
short, any known technique for applying heat which brings the material to its melting<br>
point will work. How to form other shaped media is also known in the art.<br>
[052] The known methods of forming spheres from carbides also form spheres when the<br>
known methods are applied to multi-carbide materials, but the acceptable spheres amount<br>
to approximately 40 % of the total produced. A new method for producing spheres from<br>
multi-carbide materials was therefore developed. According to an embodiment of the<br>
invention, the method for producing spheres from multi-carbide materials is as follows.<br>
The multi-carbide material is formed into spheres preferably by admixing fine particles of<br>
the elements intended to comprise fee multi-carbide material in appropriate ratios, by<br>
adequately mixing the components, by maintaining the stability of the mixture by<br>
introduction of an inert binding agent, by subdividing the mixture into aggregates each<br>
having a mass approximately equal to that of the desired sphere to be formed, by<br>
applying heat to the subdivided aggregate sufficient to cause its elements to fuse, and by<br>
cooling the fused sphere in a manner that preserves its spherical shape. This<br>
manufacturing process is used to make small and regular spheres that are composed of<br>
multi-carbide material. Spheres of very small diameters, i.e., less man 500 microns<br>
diameter and down to 0.5 microns diameter, with regular geometries and predictable,<br>
optimized compositions can be produced.<br>
[053] Spheres of multi-carbide material can be formed in this manner by the use of a<br>
thermal plasma torch or vertical thermal tube to raise the temperature of the multi-carbide<br>
particles above their melting point as they pass through the plasma or down the tube.<br>
Other methods that can so raise the temperature of the multi-carbides, such as melt<br>
atomization or arc melting, also should be effective.<br>
[054] Such spheres can be utilized as grinding media in media mills ("multi-carbide<br>
grinding media"), as the grinding medium in a hard body drill bit or grinding wheel, as<br>
the abrasive medium for "sand blasting" shaping techniques^ and in other applications.<br>
[055] Shapes other than spheres can be formed. For example, a variety of shapes can be<br>
formed by molding and sintering sufficiently small particles of the multi-carbide material.<br>
The geometry of such shapes can be varied nearly arbitrarily to achieve different grinding<br>
properties. The manufacturing process is an improvement over the current art in that it<br>
forms multi-carbides by processes that better mix and do not vaporize elements during<br>
manufacture, improving predictability and performance characteristics of the produced<br>
material; and that do not crack or otherwise degrade the material as it is formed into<br>
useful shapes, to improve the mechanical toughness of the produced material.<br>
[056] The multi-carbide grinding media, of whatever shape, can be used in media mills<br>
to achieve efficient and thorough comminution of materials with high purity due to the<br>
extreme hardness, extreme density, and extreme mechanical toughness of the material,<br>
independent of size or shape. In such applications, particles of product material to be<br>
reduced in size are admixed with the colliding grinding media. The product material<br>
particles, interspersed between the grinding media units, are rapidly reduced in size.<br>
Reductions to controlled dimensions as small as 10"9 meters can be achieved and readily<br>
reproduced with the right combination of initial source material, grinding media and<br>
media mill or other reduction process. Due to the engineered material properties of the<br>
multi-carbide grinding media, the wear rates of the grinding media units are extremely<br>
low and their grinding effectiveness is very high, enabling the efficient conversion of<br>
coarse particles into extremely small product size while maintaining high purity. That is,<br>
the multi-carbide grinding media deliver virtually no contamination to the product<br>
material.<br>
[057] Separation of product from the multi-carbide grinding media is accomplished by<br>
various means known in the art, such as washing and filtering or gravity separation. The<br>
product particles are much smaller than the grinding media, so separation can be<br>
accomplished efficiently and effectively.<br>
[058] Selection of appropriate grinding media material is critical to outcome. Very<br>
small variations in the chemical composition of a material can have a great effect upon its<br>
performance as a grinding or milling medium. Changes of 
in a carbide have been shown to cause changes of 40% or more in hardness, mechanical<br>
toughness, or other important property of the compound.<br>
[059] All of the above compositional and processing considerations for producing<br>
microspheres of superior performance for milling also apply for producing spheres of the<br>
present invention for laser cladding, other surfacing techniques, and hard bodies.<br>
[060] For example, the media of the present invention include mill media of any<br>
geometry composed of multiple carbide-forming elements, with carbon, having a density<br>
greater than 8 gm/cc and a combination of hardness and toughness sufficient to permit<br>
use in a media mill without contamination of the milled product to an amount greater<br>
than 800 ppm.<br>
[061] According to the present invention, a method for making spheres, composed of<br>
multiple carbide-forming elements, with carbon, for use as mill media, or in cladding<br>
material, as surfacing material, or in hard body materials containing these spheres,<br>

composition;<br>

carbide material with a mass density greater than 8 gm/cc and a hardness and toughness<br>
sufficient not to contaminate the milled particles to a degree greater than 900 ppm;<br>
(c) processing the feed particles at an energy intensity to cause size reduction of<br>
the feed particles, in a dry or wet media mill, for a period of time sufficient to reduce the<br>
particle size to the preferred size; and<br>
(d) if desired, dehydriding the ultrafine metals hydride particulates by heating to<br>
the dehydration temperature by methods now known in the art. Such particles are useful<br>
for the manufacture of catalyst, alloy bodies containing metals, ceramic bodies containing<br>
metals in the composition, electronic inks, metallo-organic compounds, applications such<br>
as pigments, polishing compounds, polymer fillers, sensors, catalyst, promoters, the<br>
manufacture of superalloy components, the manufacture of metal components combining<br>
various metals processed by this claim, for use in the hard metals industries where metals<br>
is a binder metal and also being more economic than that obtained by other means<br>
[077] As discussed in the Background section, the search for an optimal material to be<br>
used as mill media has been ongoing. After much experimentation and testing, multi-<br>
carbides were identified by the inventor as a possible material. Although the multi-<br>
carbides disclosed by the Rudy patents showed a combination of hardness, density and<br>
mechanical toughness that promised to be useful for milling, the known geometries for<br>
available multi-carbide materials rendered them incompatible with such use. Difficulties<br>
included the large size of multi-carbide material that is produced by current<br>
manufacturing methods, and difficulty in machining or otherwise manipulating the<br>
material into sizes and shapes useful for milling due in part to its hardness and<br>
mechanical toughness.<br>
[078] After extensive analysis and experimentation, the effectiveness of using multi-<br>
carbide grinding media was shown empirically in the following experiment. Spheres<br>
according to the present invention were formed by taking material composed of Ti, W,<br>
and C and preparing spheres 150 microns in diameter. The test composition in this<br>
example was 86.7 wt% tungsten, 4.5 wt% carbon, and the balance titanium.<br>
Agglomerates of particulates of this test composition were spheridized in an RF Plasma<br>
spray unit. The density of the material was confirmed as being the same as the multi-<br>
carbide material that was sought to be made.<br>
[079] The multi-carbide spheres of the present invention were then subjected to<br>
hardness testing. A compression test was employed in which a single small sphere was<br>
isolated between two pieces of ground tungsten plate and a force was applied to one of<br>
the plates. The intention was to increase the applied pressure until the sphere fragmented<br>
due to the extreme load at the point contact between the plate and the sphere.<br>
Unexpectedly, spheres of the test composition did not fracture, but instead embedded into<br>
the tungsten plate, demonstrating hardness of the test material well above that of pure<br>
tungsten. In a second test, several spheres were positioned between two tungsten plates<br>
and the top plate was struck with a weight so as to induce high transitory g-forces on the<br>
spheres. None of the spheres fractured, with many of the spheres embedded into the<br>
tungsten plate. In two instances of the experiment, the tungsten plate fractured and<br>
cleaved, but with no apparent damage to the spheres. In another experiment, spheres of<br>
the test composition were placed between two ground glass plates. Upon applying<br>
pressure, the glass micro-fragmented around its points of contact with the spheres, but no<br>
damage to the spheres was observed.<br>
[080] The multi-carbide spheres were subjected to mechanical toughness testing.<br>
Spheres of the test composition were placed in a vibratory mill with calcium carbide and<br>
agitated for a period of time sufficient to cause significant grinding media degradation by<br>
all known grinding media. No evidence of contamination by grinding media degradation<br>
was observed from such use of the resultant spheres, and very fine, regular and pure<br>
calcium carbide was obtained.<br>
[081] The multi-carbide spheres were also subjected to testing by use in standard<br>
industry processes. The spheres were used in a high-volume media mill and operated<br>
under nominal industrial production conditions used to mill titania. Titania is particularly<br>
sensitive to discoloration from contamination and was chosen to be a sensitive indicator<br>
to see if the microspheres were able to impart wear without themselves wearing<br>
significantly. Billions of particles of titania were processed to a final particle size of<br>
approximately 7 x 10"8 meters without perceptible evidence of grinding media<br>
degradation.<br>
[082] While testing and. processing various materials, impurities were occasionally<br>
measured to see how the process was working. Tests were conducted with calcium<br>
carbonate processed to less than 100 nm using standard media mill operating conditions<br>
and the grinding media of the invention of 120 microns diameter. The contamination<br>
level in the milled product was measured to be less than 100 ppm, and in some instances,<br>
less than 10 ppm. It is expected that the contamination level should always be below 300<br>
ppm. The contamination level is dependent on the substance being milled, with calcium<br>
carbonate being relatively soft. It is expected that the contamination level should always<br>
be below 300 ppm even when milling alumina.<br>
[083] While the present invention has been described with reference to a particular<br>
preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention<br>
is not limited to the preferred embodiment and that various modifications and the like<br>
