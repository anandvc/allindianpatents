COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"OIL PUMP FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
internal combustion engine, and more specifically, of a lubricant pump for compact internal combustion engine. [0002] [Prior Art] Oil pumps for internal combustion engines in the related art include the one disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 63492/1986.  This type of oil pump is independently provided as a single unit, and distributes oil to a crankshaft, a big end of a con'rod, a head, and the like through a crankcase. [0003] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
When disposing an oil pump in the internal combustion engine, it has been disposed at the position circumventing the area for other oil channels, or in contrast to it, the oil channels have been disposed so as to bypass the oil pump. [0004]<br>
Therefore, the oil channels became complicated and thus the internal combustion engine has been upsized. In other words, when oil channels are disposed in the wall of the crankcase, the cylinder block, or the like, if the oil cannel has twists or turns, it is difficult to make a hole only in the direction of dies cutting of the die-cast, and thus the oil hole must be processed, thereby increasing the cost. [0005] [Means for Solving the Problems and Advantage]<br><br><br>
Ir. order to solve the problem in the related art described above, the invention stated in Claim 1 is an oil pump for internal combustion engine characterized in that a pump case and pump plate defines a pump chamber for accommodating a pump rotor, and an oil channel chamber adjacent to and closed off the pump chamber is provided. Therefore, according to the invention stated in Claim 1, the oil pump may be disposed at the positions overlapped with the oil channels, and thus the oil channel may be shortened.<br>
[0006]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is the invention stated in Claim 1, characterized in that the oil channel chamber is defined between the pump plate and the outer cover disposed outwardly of the pump plate. Therefore, in the invention stated in Claim 2, even when an oil channel chamber closed off the pump chamber is provided, the structure of the oil pump is not complexified.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is the invention stated in Claim 1, characterized in that a plurality of oil exits are provided in the oil channel chamber. Therefore, in the invention stated in Claim 3, oil can be easily distributed through the oil channel chamber of the oil pump.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention according to Claim 4 is the invention<br><br><br>
stated in Claim 1, characterized in that the pump rotor comprises an inner rotor and an outer rotor, in that the inner rotor is disposed coaxially with the crankshaft and driven by the crankshaft, and in that an oil channel extending into the crankshaft is provided. Therefore, in the invention stated in Claim 4, the mechanism to drive the oil pump is simple, and oil feeding to the crankshaft and oil feeding to other portions can be performed concurrently and easily.<br>

[0009] [Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view in longitudinal section (cross section taken along the line I-I in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6) showing an oil pump according to an embodiment of the present invention; Fig 2 is a bottom view in longitudinal cross section (cross section taken along the line II-II in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6) thereof; Fig. 3 is a longitudinal cross section (cross section taken along the line III-III in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) thereof; Fig. 4 is a lateral cross section taken along the line IV-IV in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3;  Fig. 5 is a lateral cross section taken along the line V-V in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3; Fig. 6 is a lateral cross section taken along the line VI-VI of Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3. [0010]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, a pump case 1 and a pump plate 2 defines a pump chamber 3,   and as shown in Fig. 5, an<br><br><br>
outer rotor 4 having inner teeth and an inner rotor 5 having outer teeth to be engaged with the inner teeth are accommodated in the pump chamber 3 . The number of teeth of the inner rotor 5 is smaller than the number of teeth of the outer rotor 4 by one. The axes of rotation of the outer rotor 4 and the inner rotor 5 are decentered with each other. The inner rotor 5 is fitted within a hollow drive shaft 6 coaxially connected to the crankshaft described later, so as not to rotate.<br>
[0011]<br>
The pump case 1 is provided with an inlet port 7 and a discharge port 8, which are opened toward the pump chamber 3, as shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 4. The inlet port 7 is in communication with the inlet opening 9, and the discharge port 8 is in communication with the discharge opening 10. The reference numerals 11 and 12 represent dwell pins. As described thus far, the trochoid pump is constructed of components designated by the reference numerals 1 to 12.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to this embodiment, the outer cover 13 is disposed outwardly of the pump chamber 3, which defines an oil channel chamber 14 with the pump chamber 3. The reference numeral 15 designates a snap ring for fixing the outer cover 13 and the reference numeral 16 designates an  O-ring.<br>
[0013]<br>
The pump case 1 is provided with an oil channel chamber<br><br><br>
entrance 17, two oil channel chamber exits 18a and 18b, and accessway 19 to the oil channel chamber entrance and accessways 20a, 20b to the oil channel chamber exits in communication therewith respectively. The accessway 19 to the oil channel chamber entrance and the accessways 20a and 20b to the oil channel chamber exits pass through the pump plate 2 and open toward the oil channel chamber 14. The hollow portion 6a of the drive shaft 6 is also in communication with the oil channel chamber 14 via the groove 2a provided at the center of the pump plate 2.<br>
[0014]<br>
Fig. 7 is a conceptual diagram of a part of the lubricating system of the internal combustion engine including the oil pump viewed in the direction of the axis of the crankshaft, and Fig. 8 is a developed figure of Fig. 7 and viewed in the direction orthogonal to the axis of the crankshaft.<br>
[0015]<br>
In Fig. 7, the inlet opening 9 of the oil pump 30 and the strainer 32 disposed at the bottom of the crankcase 31 are in communication with each other via the inlet pipeline 33. The discharge opening 10 of the oil pump 30 is in communication with the entrance to the oil filter 35 via the discharge channel 34. The exit of the oil filter 35 is in communication with the oil channel chamber entrance 17 of the oil pump 3 0 via the return channel 36. The oil channel chamber exits 18a and 18b<br><br><br>
of the oil pump 30 are connected to a main shaft 39 of a crutch 38, a shaft of a supercharging pump 40, and a head portion 41, and the like via the oil channel 37a, 37b, 37c, 37d, and the like respectively. [0016]<br>
In Fig. 8, the hollow portion 6a of the drive shaft 6 of the oil pump 3 0 is in communication with the interior of the crankshaft 42. The return channel 36, the oil channels 37b, 37c, 37d, and the like for bringing the oil filter 35, the main shaft 39 of the clutch 38, the head portion 41, and the like into communication with the oil pump 3 0 are all provided within the walls of the crankcase 31 and the cylinder block 43.<br>
[0017]<br>
The reference numeral 29 in Fig. 7 designates a mating plane of the casing, and simultaneously a parting plane of the mold. The inlet pipeline 33, the oil channel 37a, and the like are formed on this mating plane 29, and the discharge channel 34, the return channel 36, the oil channels 37b, 37c, 37d, and the like are formed in the direction orthogonal to the mating plane 29.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the oil pump 30 as described above, when the crankshaft 42 drives the drive shaft 6, the inner rotor 5 rotates, and then the outer rotor 4 rotates. Then, by its pumping action,<br><br><br>
lubricant collected in the oil pan at the bottom of the crankcase 31 is sucked into the inlet opening 9 and inlet port 7 via the strainer 32 and the inlet pipeline 33, and discharged through the discharge port 8 and the discharge opening 10. Discharged lubricant reaches the oil filter 35 via the discharge channel 34 , where the foreign substances are removed, then goes back to the oil pump 30 via the return channel 36, and then is introduced through the oil channel chamber entrance 17 and the accessway 19 to the oil channel chamber entrance to the oil channel chamber 14. Lubricant introduced into the oil channel chamber 14 of the oil pump 30 proceeds from there through the accessways 20a and 20b to the oil channel chamber exits to the oil channel chamber exits 18a, 18b, and then passes through the oil channels 37a, 37b, 37c, 37d, and the like to the main shaft 3 9 of the clutch 38, the shaft of the supercharging pump 40, the head portion 41, and the like to lubricate them. A part of lubricant in the oil channel chamber 14 is also introduced to the oil channel in the crankshaft 42 through the groove 2a of the pump plate 2 and the hollow portion 6a of the drive shaft 6 for lubricating the crankpin, the con'rod, the cylinder, and the like.<br>
[0019]<br>
Since the oil channel chamber 14 of this embodiment is provided adjacent to and closed off the pump chamber 3 of the oil pump 30, the oil pump 30 may be disposed at the position<br><br><br>
overlapped with the oil channel, and thus the oil channel may be shortened. Since the oil channel chamber 14 is defined between the pump plate 2 and the outer cover 13 disposed outwardly thereof, the construction of the oil pump 3 0 may be prevented from being complexified and the dimension thereof is hardly increased at all.<br>
[0020]<br>
Since a plurality of the oil passage chamber exits 18a, 18b are provided in the oil passage chamber 14 in this embodiment, distribution of lubricant can be easily performed. In addition, since the drive shaft 6 of the inner rotor 5 is coaxially connected with the crankshaft 42 in this embodiment, the mechanism to drive the oil pump 3 0 is simple, and since the hollow portion 6a of the drive shaft 6 is in communication with the oil channel chamber 14 and with the interior of the crankshaft 42 via the groove 2a at the center of the pump plate 2, oil feeding to the crankshaft 42 and oil feeding to other portions can be performed concurrently and easily.<br>
[0021]<br>
In addition, since the oil channels provided in the walls of the crankcase 31, the cylinder block 43, or the like do not have to turn and twist so much according to the present invention, most of the oil holes may be formed by dies cutting of the die-cast, and thus no processing is necessary.<br>
