				<td>BACKGROUND Of Tl 1C INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to an improved spilling oil cut-out valve for a motorcycle, and especially to an improved spilling oil cut-out valve used in the fuel pipe line for the fuel tank of a motorcycle. The valve can, in addition to automatically cut out spilling of fuel during the motorcycle falling over, rapidly open to eliminate the negative pressure in the fuel tank to restore fuel supplying after raising the motorcycle from falling over, thereby, the engine of the motorcycle can be started again.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, in the peripheral equipment of the engine 5 of a motorcycle, a spilling oil cut-out valve 1 is mounted between a fuel outlet 31 of an fuel tank and a fuel pipeline 30 of an active carbon can 4. Before falling over of the motorcycle (that is a normal state), the spilling oil cut-out valve 1 is open, thereby, fuel vapor in a fuel tank 3 can flow from the spilling oil cutout valve 1 to the active carbon can 4 for filtering fuel gas to the outside. Thereby, the fuel pipeline 30 can allow exhausting of the fuel vapor, this can avoid deformation of the fuel tank 3 due to overly large pressure generated by fuel evaporation in the fuel tank; and can allow air entering the fuel tank 3 from the outside. So that an air chamber 33 in the fuel tank 3 will not have a negative pressure by lowering of a fuel surface 32 due to fuel consumption, thus a fuel supplying pipeline 50 between the fuel tank 3 and a carburetor 51 will not impeded from normal operation. That is, before falling over, the motorcycle can keep normal fuel supplying and recycling of fuel vapor.<br><br>
However, the object of providing the spilling oil cut-out valve 1 is to prevent the danger of spilling and leakage of fuel by shutting up and cutting out the fuel pipeline 30 by the spilling oil cut-out valve 1 when the motorcycle falls over. And such a conventional spilling oil cut-out valve 1 is designed in pursuance of the above stated requirement, it is comprised generally of a valve body 10 having therein a valve rod 11 and a hammer 12 (as shown in Fig. 2), wherein, the valve rod 11 and the hammer 12 have therebetween a spring 13 with a smaller elastic force, and another spring 14 with a larger elastic force is provided between the hammer 12 and the valve body 10.<br>
When the motorcycle falls over (i.e., the valve body 10 falls over), by deviation of gravity of the hammer 12 with a larger weight, the spring 14 can overcome the total weight of the hammer 12, the spring 13 with a smaller elastic force and the valve rod 11, thereby, the spring 13 is pushed to move the valve rod 11 to shut a valve port 15 to cut out the fuel passage between the fuel tank 3 and the active carbon can 4. Thus the object of cutting out spilling fuel can be achieved.<br>
However, by experience, we know that when a motorcycle falls over, the engine of the motorcycle still runs, combusting fuel for running the engine, by virtue that the spilling oil cut-out valve now has been operated to shut, the air chamber 33 in the fuel tank 3 will form a negative pressure by fuel consumption. The negative pressure will sustain for a lengthy of time until the fuel supplying pipeline 50 is impeded from normal operation to automatically engine stop. Nonetheless, the negative pressure may suck the valve rod 11 to form a shutting mode in the spilling oil cut-out valve 1 to render the valve 1 unable to open after raising the motorcycle from falling over, and the engine of the motorcycle can hardly be started again.<br><br>
The main reason of such trouble is that, although the motorcycle raised from falling over can render the hammer 12 in the valve body 10 to back to the down position thereof to no more push the valve rod 11, however, the hammer 12 does not have the ability to move down the valve rod 11 which is still sucked by the negative pressure to tightly close the valve port 15. Therefore, the fuel pipeline 30 and the fuel supplying pipeline 50 are both blocked, thus the motorcycle raised from falling over is unable to supply fuel immediately. The user must shake the motorcycle violently to render the valve rod 11 to get off the valve port 15 to release the negative pressure in the fuel tank 3, and then the fuel pipeline 30 and the fuel supplying pipeline 50 can restart their normal fuel supplying and operations of fuel vapor filtering and recycling can all be restored.<br>
Therefore, after falling over of the motorcycle to cut out spilling fuel, the valve rod of the conventional spilling oil cut-out valve is often unable to restore its down position to open the valve. This is its largest trouble. To overcome this, it is necessary to improve the linking relationship between the valve rod and the hammer, and the present invention is aiming at this goal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved spilling oil cut-out valve for a motorcycle, it can automatically cut out the passage of fuel during the motorcycle falling over, and rapidly open the passage of fuel after raising the motorcycle from falling over.<br>
To get this object, the present invention is provided in practice between a valve rod and a hammer in its valve body with a spring with a smaller elastic force, and between the hammer and the valve body with another spring with a larger elastic force. Thereby, before the motorcycle falls over (i.e., the valve<br><br>
body is in its normal position), the spring with a larger elastic force can bear the total weight of the hammer, the spring with the smaller elastic force and the calve rod; thereby, it can push with its larger spring force the hammer and the valve rod connected with the spring with the smaller elastic force to tightly close the valve port when the motorcycle falls. Hence the fuel passage is cut out to prevent leakage of fuel. The present invention takes advantage of the weight of the hammer to draw the valve rod to overcome the negative pressure and to open the valve port. Therefore, in its design, the valve rod must be made to accept the drawing force of the hammer as a linking relationship thereto in favour of cutting out fuel spilling when in falling over, and rapid restoring opening of the valve after raising the motorcycle from falling over to restore oil supplying. In this way, when the motorcycle is raised from falling over, it can automatically turn off and cut out spilling fuel and automatically open the valve for fuel supplying rapidly.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved spilling oil cut-out valve for a motorcycle comprising a valve body with a valve port, a valve rod and a hammer mounted within the said valve body, the weight of said hammer being larger than that of the valve rod, said hammer being loaded with a first spring having an elastic force, a second spring having an elastic force less than that of the said first spring, said second spring being located on the tail end of said valve rod, characterized in that:<br>
said hammer comprises a housing and a seat, said housing being provided with a hole, said valve rod being provided with an annular flange on said tail end thereof, said valve rod being mounted on said housing of said hammer under a spring force, so that said hammer pushes and draws back said valve rod to control opening and closing of said valve port.<br>
The present invention will be apparent after reading the detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof in reference to the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view showing allocation of a conventional spilling oil cut-out valve;<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing the conventional spilling oil cut-out valve;<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective schematic view showing the spilling oil cut-out valve of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view showing the spilling oil cut-out valve of the present invention during opening of the valve;<br><br>
Fig. 5 is a sectional view showing the spilling oil cut-out valve of the present invention during closing of the valve. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring firstly to Fig. 3, an improved spilling oil cut-out valve 2 for a motorcycle of the present invention is comprised in a preferred embodiment thereof of: a valve body 20 and a valve cover 29, the valve body 20 is provided with a fuel intake 201 and a valve port 25 in the fuel intake 201 (as shown in Fig. 4); the valve cover 29 is provided with a fuel outlet 291, so that the valve body 20 can be loaded therein with an assembly of a valve rod 21 and a hammer 22, the assembly is covered by the valve cover 29.<br>
Wherein, the valve rod 21 is provided on the front end thereof with a conical plastic valve head 210, it can prevent oil leakage by closely shutting the valve port 25. The valve rod 21 is provided on the tailing end thereof with an annularflange 212 and a recessed spring receiving chamber 213, thereby, the spring receiving chamber 213 can receive therein a spring 23 with the smaller elastic force, the valve rod 21 is mounted on the housing 27 of the hammer 22 by means of the annularflange 212 (as shown in Fig. 4).<br>
The housing 27 is provided thereon with a hole 272 for extending therethrough the valve rod 21, so that the valve rod 21 is mounted on the housing 27 by means of its annularflange 212 on the tailing end thereof, and the spring 23 with the smaller elastic force can abut against the valve rod 21 and a seat 26 of the hammer 22 (as shown in Fig. 3 or 4).<br>
The weight of the housing 27 is larger than that of the valve rod 21, and the hammer 22 is composed of the housing 27 and the seat 26 (as shown in Fig. 3 or 4), the seat 26 is provided with an external thread 261 for connecting with the housing 27 with an internal thread 271, the bottom of the<br><br>
seat 26 receives a spring 24 with a larger elastic force.<br>
Thereby, when the valve body 20 is in its normal position (i.e., the motorcycle does not fall over), by virtue that the spring 24 bears the hammer 22, the spring 23 with the smaller elastic force and the valve rod 21, the valve rod 21 can open the valve port 25 in normal time (as shown in Fig. 4); and the hammer 22, the spring 23 with the smaller elastic force and the valve rod 21 can accept the larger spring force released from the spring 24 when the valve body 20 is tilted (i.e., the motorcycle falls over), thus the spring 23 pushes the valve rod 21 to shut the valve port 25 (as shown in Fig. 5).<br>
And more, after cutting out of spilling fuel and raising of motorcycle from falling over (restoring to the situation depicted in Fig. 4), by backing to the down position of the hammer 22 in the valve body 20 under its own weight and by that the hammer 22 can draw down the valve rod 21 to return to its original down position, the valve rod 21 can overcome the suction force from the negative pressure in an fuel tank 3 easily to make fast departing of the valve rod 21 from the valve port 25. Therefore, the valve is opened again and fuel vapor can flow to an active carbon can 4. The negative pressure in the fuel tank 3 can be eliminated, and the fuel in the fuel tank 3 can supply rapidly for a carburetor 51 to make an engine 5 restart. In this mode, the motorcycle can automatically rapidly open the fuel passage of the spilling oil cut-out valve after raising the motorcycle from falling over.<br>
In conclusion, the present invention provides an improved spilling oil cut-out valve for a motorcycle, which, in addition to the effect of automatic closing the valve and cutting out spilling fuel during falling over thereof, can automatically rapidly open the fuel passage after raising the motorcycle from falling over. And the assembly formed from the hammer and the valve rod is<br><br><br><br><br>
