DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a manufacturing apparatus 1 for manufacturing a disposable worn article according to the first embodiment.<br>
The manufacturing apparatus 1 includes an adhesive applicator 13 for applying an adhesive on a first sheet 10, a guide 21 for guiding an elastic member 20 between the first sheet 10 and a second sheet 30, press rolls 31 and 32 for pressing together the first sheet 10 and the second sheet 30 into a combined web 40, and a processing section 2 for cutting off at least a part of, or reducing the shrinking force of, the elastic member 20 of the combined web 40 produced through the press rolls 31 and 32 . The adhesive maybe applied on the second sheet 30.<br>
The adhesive applicator 13 is capable of applying i an adhesive on the first sheet 10, which has a strip shape<br>
of a predetermined widthand which is advanced in the X direct ion<br>
(the direction of the production flow) , so that an adhesive portion 11 and a non-adhesive portion 12 are provided on the first sheet 10. In terms of the air permeability of the combined web 40, it is preferred that the adhesive applicator 13 is a spray coater, a curtain coater, a spiral coater, or the like. The amount of adhesive is preferably about 1 g/m2 to about 20 g/m2. The adhesive may be a hot melt. A specific example of the adhesive applicator 13 will be described later. The elastic member 20 under a predetermined tension is supplied to the guide 21. The elastic member 20 may be in the form of a plurality of lines, as illustrated in FIG. 1, or a mesh (e.g., elastomeric netting such as REBOUND(R1 of CONWED PLASTICS may be used) . The elastic member 20 may be a string rubber or a flat rubber. The guide 21 is capable of reciprocating transversely of the direction of the production flow. In such a case, the guide 21 is capable of guiding the elastic member 20 between the first sheet 10 and the second sheet 30 so that the elastic member 20 is drawn in a non-linear line. A predetermined tension is applied to the elastic member 20 supplied to the guide 21 by means of a tension roll (not shown).<br>
The processing section 2 includes an embossing roll 50 and a counter roll 60 facing the embossing roll 50. The combined web 40 is inserted between the embossing roll 50 and the counter roll 60, and the processing section 2 cuts off at least a part of, or reduces the shrinking force of, the elastic member 20. The embossing roll 50 includes an embossing section 51 having a plurality of protrusions . The<br>
protrusions may generate heat as will be described later. In such a case, the amount of heat to be generated is determined by the distance between the embossing roll 50 and the counter roll 60, the shape and/or the size of each protrusion, the material, the cross-sectional area and/or the shape of the elastic member 20, and/or the speed at which the combined web 40 is advanced.<br>
FIG. 2AtoFIG. 2C illustrate an exemplary disposable worn article made of the combined web 40, which has been passed through the processing section 2 . The disposable worn article illustrated in FIG. 2A to FIG. 2C (e.g., disposable underpants or a disposable diaper; hereinafter referred to simply as "underpants") includes a design area 150 having a graphical design or characters printed thereon. If the shrinking force of a part of the elastic member 20 on the design area 150 is not reduced or eliminated, the design area 150 will be wrinkled by the force, thereby deteriorating the appearance of the article.<br>
Also in cases where a label having a graphical design or characters printed thereon is attached to the combined web 40, the label will have wrinkles due to the shrinkage of theelasticmember 20, therebydeteriorating the appearance of the article. Besides, such wrinkles make it difficult to adhere, on the combined web 40, a member such as a label, a tape used for fixing a diaper, a tape used when disposing<br>
of the article having the combined web 40, etc. Even if such<br>
I a member is successfully adhered on the combined web 40 while<br>
the wrinkles are being smoothed out, it is difficult to keep<br>
the adhesion between the combined web 40 and the member for a long period of time due to the shrinkage of the elastic member 20.<br>
Underpants 130 include the adhesive portion 11, the non-adhesive portion 12 which has substantially the same width as that of the design area 150, and the part of the elastic member 20 on the design area 150 is cut off. The shrinkage of the cut elastic member 20 stops in the vicinity of the boundary between the adhesive portion 11 and the non-adhesive portion 12. Where the combined web 40 has the non-adhesive portion 12, it is preferred that the embossing section 51 has at least two rows of protrusions such that a portion of a protrusion in the first row overlaps a portion of a protrusion in the second row in the direction of the rotation axis of the embossing roll 50, in order to reduce or eliminate the shrinking force of the elastic member 20 on the design area 150. This is because it is not possible, with a single row of protrusions, to cut off a portion of the elastic member 20 located between adj acent protrusions . Even with a single row of protrusions, the elastic member 20 can be cut of f if the protrusions are in a slant arrangement. Alternatively, for example, cuttingoff, etc., of aplurality of rubber strings can be achieved with a single protrusion. The length L2 of the embossing section 51 may be slightly smaller than the length L1 of the non-adhesive portion 12. In underpants 140, an adhesive is applied also in the design area 150. In order to reduce or eliminate the shrinking force of the part of the elastic member 20 on the<br><br>
design area 150, it is preferred that the protrusions in each row are arranged at a predetermined interval in the embossing section 51 across the entirety of the design area 150. In other words, it is preferred that the protrusions have an overlap with one another as they are projected in the axial direction of the embossing roll 50.<br>
While the elastic member 20 exists under the sheet, the processing section 2 may be used to reduce or eliminate the shrinking force of the elastic member 20 in advance in cases where an additional member (e.g., a tape used when disposing of the underpants or a tape to be attached to a diaper body or a label) is adhered on the sheet. This is because it is difficult to fix such an additional member on the sheet while the elastic member 20 is shrunk.<br>
Underpants 160 are made of a combined web having a meshed elastic member 170 sandwiched between the first and second sheets at a predetermined tension. In a waist area 161, the vertical elastics are cut off while leaving the horizontal elastics (the elastic around the waist) so that the underpants 160 fit well to the body. Note however that the vertical and horizontal elastics are both cut off in an area 162 where an additional member or a label is adhered. Moreover, the vertical and horizontal elastics are both cut off in a predetermined area 163 . The predetermined area 163 is an area where it is preferred that the underpants 160 do not shrink. An absorber may be provided in the area. As described above, it is made possible to adhere a member on the combined web 40 by reducing the shrinking<br>
force of the elastic member 20 of the combined web 40 in areas where the member is to be adhered. Possible methods for reducing or eliminating the shrinking force of the elastic member 20 include: cutting of f the elastic member 20 ; reducing the shrinking force of the elastic member 20; altering the molecular structure of the elastic member 20 (when the elastic member 20 is a rubber) , and melting a part of the combined web 40 and curing the melted part.<br>
The protrusions may generate heat in order to reduce or eliminate the shrinking force of the elastic member. In such a case, the elastic member 20 is cut of f by the protrusions melting at least a part of the second sheet 30 and at least a part of the elastic member 20. In this process, the first sheet and the second sheet are sealed together. For example, in the case of the underpants 130, the first sheet and the second sheet are sealed together while the elastic member 20 is cut off. The wrinkling of the elastic member 20 is improved when the shrinking force of the elastic member 20 is reduced, even if the elastic member 20 is not cut off. Moreover, even if the protrusions do not generate heat, it is possible to cut off the elastic member 20 via the second sheet 30 when the width of each protrusion is small (e.g.,severalmicronstoabout0 . 5 mm). Inthisprocess, at least apart of the second sheet 30 is cut by the protrusions, thereby increasing the air permeability of the underpants 140. In addition to the design area 150, a part of the elastic member 20 corresponding to an upper waist area 151 and/or a leg area 152 of the underpants 140 may also be opened by<br>
the protrusions.<br>
The protrusions of the embossing section 51 will now bedescribed. FIG.3Aillustratesanembosspatternincluding aplural ity of rectangular protrus ions arranged in a s taggered pattern. The embossing section 51 includes: an n-lch row of rectangular protrusions 53, 53 each having a length Si and a width W1 which are arranged in the axial direction of the embossing roll 50 (indicated by a solid arrow) at intervals of a distance DI; an nth row of protrusions 54, 54 each having the same length (SJ and width (W1) as those of the protrusions 53 which are arranged in the circumferential direction of the embossing roll 50 (indicated by an outline arrow) at adistanceof M1 fromtheprotrusions 53 so that the longitudinal center line thereof passes through a point of D1/2; and an n+lth row of protrusions 55, 55 having the same shape as that of the protrusions 53 which are arranged in the same manner as the protrusions 53. The number of protrusions in each row may be determined based on, for example, the number of elasticmemberstobecutoff. Thenumberof rowsofprotrusions may be determined based on the length L1 of the non-adhesive portion. Herein, n is a natural number, and "0 row" means there is no row of protrusions.<br>
In an alternative emboss pattern where n is a natural number equal to or greater than 2, a protrusion in the n-lth row may overlap with the protrusion in the n+lth row in the row direction by at least 1 mm or more. In such a case, a protrusion in the n-1th row may not overlap with the protrusion in the nth row or may overlap with the protrusion in the nth<br>
row by about 0.5 mm to about 1 mm. In this way, the density of protrusions in each row may be reduced as compared to the emboss pattern illustrated in FIG. 3A, thereby facilitating the production of the emboss roll.<br>
With an emboss roll having such protrusions as described above, as compared to an emboss roll having a single line blade, the protrusions more easily cut into the combined web, whereby it is possible to easily cut off the elastic member.<br>
FIG. 3B shows a pattern in which diamond-shaped protrusions are arranged in a staggered pattern.  The embossing section 51 includes: a row of diamond-shaped protrusions 56, 56 each having a long axis S2 and a short axis W2 which are arranged in the axial direction of the embossing roll 50 (indicated by a solid arrow) at intervals of a distance D2; another row of protrusions 57 , 57 each having the same diamond shape as the protrusions 56 which are arranged in the circumferential direction of the embossing roll 50 (indicated by an outline arrow) at a distance of M2 from the protrusions 56 so that the short axis thereof is collinear with a point of D2/2; and still another row of protrusions 58, 58 each having the same shape as that of the protrusions 56 which are arranged in the same manner as the protrusions 56 . Of course, alsoforthispattern, thenumberof protrusions in each row may be determined based on, for example, the number of elastic members to be cut off, and the number of rows of protrusions may be determined based on the length LI of the non-adhesive portion.<br>
The length Si of the rectangular protrusions and the length of the long axis S2 of the diamond-shaped protrusions are both preferably in the range of 1 mm to 25 mm, and more preferably 2 mm to 25 mm. Where the interval DI between adjacent protrusions is less than or equal to S1, the elastic member locatedbetweenadjacentprotrusions 53 can be reliably cut off by the protrusion 54 due to the staggered arrangement. Similarly, D2 and S2 may be determined so that D2≤S2 holds. When Si or S2 is less than 1 mm, the embossing section 51 may fail to cut off the elastic member, and when it is greater than 25 mm, the feel/touch of the article may deteriorate due to the excessive total area of seal portions. DI and D2 are also preferably in the range of 1 mm to 25 mm, and D1 is more preferably 2 mm to 25 mm. Where diamond-shaped protrusions are used, if a protrusion in a row has little overlap with the closest protrusion in an adjacent row in the row direct ion, the elastic member may fall bet ween adjacent seal portions, and the embossing section 51 may thereby fail to cut off the elastic member, depending upon the arrangement of the protrusions. In view of this, D2 is more preferably 3 mm to 10 mm.<br>
When a portion of the combined web is to be melted, the width W1 of the rectangular protrusions and the length of the short axis W2 of the diamond-shaped protrusions are preferably 0.5 mm to 15 mm. When the first sheet 10 and the elastic member are cut off, W1 is preferably several microns to about 0.5 mm. When they are greater than 15 mm, the feel/touch of the manufactured article may deteriorate due<br>
to the excessive total area of seal portions . The lower limit of W2 is preferably 1 mm or more.<br>
While the distance between adjacent rows of protrusions is not limited to any particular value, MI or M2 is preferably 1 mm to 25 mm. The protrusions may have a shape other than a rectangular shape and a diamond shape as described above, including a slanted rectangular shape, a circular shape, a triangular shape, a star shape, a heart shape, a clover shape, a crescent shape, other polygons, etc. The shape of the protrusions may be varied for different rows.<br>
FIG. 4 schematically illustrates elastic members 22 and 23 having been cut off. It is assumed that the combined web is advanced downwardly in FIG. 4. The area 11 is the adhesive portion and the area 12 is the non-adhesive portion. The left-hand side elastic member 22 is cut off by a seal portion 70 (corresponding to the protrusion 53). An end portion 22a of the elastic member 22 is released from the tension and shrink toward the elastic member 22 bonded on the sheet. If the remaining part of the elastic member is caught by the protrusion 55 before completion of the cutting off by the protrusion 53, an elastic member 22b between the protrusion 53 and the protrusion 55 shrinks toward a seal portion 72 when the elastic member is cut off by the protrusion 53 . If the cutting off by the protrusion 53 is completed before the remaining part of the elastic member is caught by the protrusion 55, the elastic member 22b will shrink toward the elastic member existing in the downstream adhesive<br>
portion (not shown) . The right-hand side elastic member 23 is cut off by a seal port ion 71 (corresponding to the protrusion 54), and an end portion 23a thereof shrinks.<br>
With the arrangement described above, the elastic member is cut off and a large number of small seal portions are formed in the non-adhesive portion, whereby the upper and lower sheets are bonded together also in the non-adhesive portion. Since the seal portions are separated from one another and each have a small size, they are less likely to give discomfort to the wearer than when they are provided as a continuous line even when they are heat-sealed into a film.<br>
An exemplary adhesive applicator will now be described.<br>
FIG. 7A is a diagram illustrating an exemplary adhesive applicator 13a. The adhesive applicator 13a includes a gun member 100 for spraying an adhesive (a hot melt in the following description) while positively charging the hot melt, and a conductive member 101 which is located under the first sheet 10 and is grounded or negatively charged. Generally, not all of the hot melt sprayed from the gun member 100 is attached to the sheet, but a portion thereof is left floating in the air. However, by charging the hot melt as described above, it is possible to efficiently attach the hot melt to the sheet, and to reduce the amount of hot melt to be scattered with respect to the width direction of the sheet, thereby improving the widthwise precision. A voltage of the same polarity as the hot melt may be applied to portions<br>
where it is not necessary to apply the hot melt.<br>
It is possible to improve the positional precision of the attachment of the hot melt in the flow direction, which is transverse to the width direction, by controlling the period in which the hot melt is output and the potential of the gun member 100 or the conductive member 101. The polarities of the applied voltages may be reversed from that described above.<br>
The conductive member 101 maybe provided in the form of a plurality of plates 101a and 101b as illustrated in FIG. 7B. For example, when the hot melt is applied on areas separated by a predetermined interval by using a plurality of gun members 100, the hot melt application may be performed with the interval between adjacent hot melt-applied areas being the interval between the plates lOla and lOlb.<br>
Alternatively, the conductive member 101 may be provided in the form of a roller 102 as illustrated in FIG. 7C. The roller 102 rotates in synchronism with the first sheet 10. The roller 102 includes a conductive portion 103 and a non-conductive portion 104. As described above, the hot melt is charged to a potential of the first polarity, and the conductive portion 103 is grounded or charged to a potential of the opposite polarity to the first polarity. The shape of the conductive portion 103 is determined based on the shape of the area of the first sheet 10 on which the hot melt is to be applied. The gun member 100 is controlled to output the hot melt a predetermined time before the leading edge of the area on which the hot melt is to be applied passes<br>
by the gun member 100, and to stop outputting the hot melt a predetermined time before the trailing edge of the area on which the hot melt is to be applied passes by the gun member 100. With such an arrangement, it ispossible toattach the hot melt to an area substantially equal to the intended area on which the hot melt should be applied. The roller 102 may be positioned upstream of the gun member 100.<br>
It is understood that the adhesive applicator as described above may be used for manufacturing articles other than disposable worn articles. Nothing may be sandwiched between the first sheet and second sheet after the application of the hot melt, or a member other than the web materials may be adhered by the hot melt after the application of the hot melt.<br>
The hot melt adhesive may be continuously applied without providing a non-adhesive portion. This maybe a more preferred embodiment than when the adhesive portions and the non-adhesive portions are alternately provided, because it is possible, in the former embodiment, to further increase the production line speed. The elastic member may be sandwiched between sheets on which an adhesive has been continuously applied and then passed between the embossing roll and the counter roll, so as to cut off only the elastic member without cutting off the sheets. After the cutting process, each elastic member 24 is held by two (or three or more) seal portions 59 and 59, as illustrated in FIG. 5, while being relaxed. Therefore, even when the coating of the hot melt adhesive is continuous, the seal portion<br>
62 surrounded by the ridges 61 being a depression. W3 denotes thewidthofeachridge, whichis 0.5 mmtoS mm. Anexcessively large width of the ridges may deteriorate the feel/touch of the manufactured article, while the ridges having a width smaller than 0.5 mm may possibly cut off the sheet. D3 is the length of each depression, which is preferably 5 mm to 25 mm, and more preferably 5 mm to 10 mm. M3 is the width of each depression, which is preferably 5 mm to 25 mm, and more preferably 5 mm to 10 mm.<br>
While FIG. 6 shows a slanted lattice pattern, the<br><br>
pattern may alternatively be any other polygonal lattice pattern such as a square lattice pattern or a rectangular lattice pattern. In this embodiment, the seal portions are in a lattice pattern, whereby it is possible to reliably cut off the elastic member. Moreover, since the latticed protrusion made up of narrow ridges extends across a sufficiently large area in a meshed pattern, the elastic member can be cut off by any of the seal portions. Where the sealing is provided by using a single line blade, all the elastic members need to be cut off by the single line blade, whereby it is necessary to perform strong sealing so that no elastic member is left uncut. As a result, the sheet may possibly be cut off. With the above-described arrangement, the elastic member can be cut off by any of the seal portions. Therefore, the sheet will not be cut off because it is not necessary to perform strong sealing and the contact surface between the sheet and the protrusion is increased. Moreover, such a latticed seal portion gives the wearer a soft feel/touch, and also is aesthetically desirable. Also in the second embodiment, the sheet may include hot melt adhesive port ions and non-adhesive port ions, or the hot melt adhesive may be continuously applied on the sheet without providing the non-adhesive portions.<br>
At least one of the embossing roll 50 and the counter roll 60 illustrated in FIG. 1 may include a heating member. Moreover, other heating members such as a rod-shaped sheathed heater, ahigh-f requencyheatingmember, a far inf raredheater, or an oil heater, maybe additionally provided in the vicinity<br>
of these rolls. In the arrangement of FIG. 1, the positions of the embossing roll 50 and the counter rol 1 60 may be reversed. It is preferred that either the first sheet 10 or the second sheet 30 is heat scalable. Applicable types of sheet include non-woven fabric, a plastic film, knit fabric, wovenfabric,paper,etc. Applicable sheet materials include known materials such as a polypropylene, a polyethylene, a polyester, a cellulose, a rayon, etc., which can be used alone or in combination of two or more. Each of the sheets 10 and 30 may be a multi-layer sheet including a number of sheets laminated together. In such a case, a heat scalable sheet should be provided on the uppermost surface of the first sheet 10 or on the lowermost surface of the second sheet 30.<br>
The elastic member may be made of a material that can be cut off by heat (e.g., a thermoplastic polyurethane, an elastomer, a rubber, etc.), and may be provided in the form of a ribbon or a string. A film-shaped elastic member (e.g., an elastomer film) can also be used because it can be reliably cut off by seal portions arranged in a staggered patternor a lattice pattern. It is preferred that theelastic member has a melting point that is lower than that of the heat scalable material of the second sheet so that the second sheet will not be cut off. The melting point of the second sheet may be higher than that of the first sheet.<br>
While FIG. 1 illustrates an example where the elastic member is adhered in the widthwise central portion of the sheet, the elastic member may alternatively be adhered near<br>
the edge of the sheet. In such a case, the emboss pattern can be changed according to the posit ion of the elastic member. According to the present invention, the seal portions can be made non-elastic after the heat seal process not only in the case where an adhesive is applied so as to provide non-adhesive portions and adhesive portions but also in the case where the adhesive application is continuous. Therefore, an elastic sheet having alternating elastic and non-elastic portions can be continuously manufactured.<br><br><br><br><br>
