Arrangement for producing a spun thread<br>
The present invention relate to an arrangement for producing a spum thread from a<br>
staple fibre strand delivered from a delivery roller pair to an airjet aggregate.<br>
comprising a fibre transporting channe arranged downstream of the delivery roller<br>
pair, said fibre transporting channel having an inlet opening and an exit opening and<br>
comprising a fibre guiding surface provided with a defecting edge, said fibre guiding<br>
surface otherwise extending essentially plane and essentially parallel to the nipping<br>
line of the delivery roller pair, which fibre guiding surface ends with a fibre delivery<br>
edge serving as a twist block in a vortex chamber downstream of the exit opening n<br>
the area of an eniry opening of a yam withdrawal channel.<br>
An arrangesment of this type is prior art in International Patent Application 02/2499:3.<br>
in this arrangement, a staple fiber strand, coming from a drafting and or another<br>
drafting aggregate, is guided through a fibre transporting channel to the enl y<br>
opening of a yarn withdrawal channel, whereby at first the front ends of the fibres<br>
held in the staple fibre strand are guided into the yam withdrawal chennel. while rear,<br>
free fibre ends are spread our and seized by the vortex stream and wound arourd<br>
the bound-in front ends already located in the entry opening of the yam wilhdrawal<br>
channel. whereby a thread with largely real twist is generated. The terms 'front" and<br>
"rear" ends of the fibres relate in this context to the transport direction of the stap-e<br>
fibre strand.<br>
The higher the drafts and the spinning speeds are, the widar the staple fibre strand<br>
is which is transported from delivery roller pair to the airjet aggregate. As the width if<br>
the staple fibre strand increases, however, it becomes more difficult to insert the<br>
fibres to be spun into the airjet aggregate without fluctuations in material mass. In the<br>
case of the known arrangement in which the fiber transporting channel has a largely<br>
conslani cross section, it has been shown that a percentage of the fibres go past the<br>
yarn withdrawal channel and are then subsequently sucked in again because of the<br>
vacuum prevailing in the airjet aggregate. This results for a short time in an<br>
accumulation of fibres, which causes an accumulation of undesirable sluos.<br>
In a non-generic arrangementt according to European patent 854 214. It is known that<br>
the fibre transporting channel, beginning at its intet opening, narrows in a XXX<br><br>
fashion This known arrangement has however, not a fibre delivery edge serving as<br>
a twist block, but rather the twist block is formed along the entire length of the fibrs<br>
transporting channel by a helix-shaped fibre guiding surface.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid to a great extern mass ftuclua lions<br>
an arrangement of the above mentioned type and thus to increase the spinning<br>
speed while retaining a satisfactory yarn quality.<br>
This object has been achieved according to the present invention in that the fibre<br>
guiding surface tapers due to lateral bordering walls of the fibre transporting channel<br>
and has reached its narrowest point by the time it reaches the deflecting edge<br>
Beginning with an approximately oval inlet opening, whose larger width extence<br>
parallel to the nipping line of the delivery roller pair, the fiber transporting channel<br>
tapers relatively rapidiy so  that the narrowest point is reached at the defleding edge<br>
of the fibre guiding surface. This smallest width is essentially retained up to the fibre<br>
delivery edge, with the result that the fibres to be spun are transported through the<br>
entry opening into the yarn withdrawal channel without any significant loss of fibre<br>
This leads no: only to an increase in the yarn quality, but also perrnits significanty<br>
higher delivery and spinning speeds.<br>
This arrangement according to the present invention can be further designed in that<br>
the fibre guiding surface reaches atleast approximately its smallest width at an that<br>
cdge arranged upstream of the dellecting edge. The smallest width of the fibre<br>
guiding surface should correspond to at the most, three times the diametsr of the<br>
entry opening ot the yarn withdrawal channel, or preferably even mensure only trwice<br>
this diameter.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, fealures and advantages cf the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent from the followinng detailed description thereof when<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is ten times enlarged an axial intersection of the arrangement according to<br>
the present invention.<br><br>
Figure 2 is a cross section of an airjet body of the eirjet aggregate along the<br>
intersection surface II-II of Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is an axial intersection along the intersection surface III-III of figure 1.<br>
Figure 4 is an axial intersection similar to figure 3 of an arrangement having a<br>
different design,<br>
Figure 5 is a view in the direction of arrow V of figure. 1 of the inlet opening .of the<br>
fibre transporting channel<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The arrangement according to Figures 1 to 3 and 5 comprises a delivery device 1 for<br>
feeding a staple fibre strand 2 to be spun, also comprising an airjet aggregate 3. in<br>
which the steple fibre strand 2 is imparted the necessary twist requires the soinning<br>
of a  thread 4.<br>
The delivery device 1 comprises a delivery roller pair 5, 6 which is arranged upstream<br>
of the airjet aggregate 3 at a Short distance therefrom these can be the front XXX<br>
of a drafting unit (not otherwise shown). A drafting unit of this hind drafts in the known<br>
way a fed sliver of a roving to a staple fibre strand 2 of the desired timeness. The<br>
delivery device 1 however can be alternatively a nipping roller pair of another drafting<br>
device or any other aggregate arranged upstream of the airjet aggregate 3. A<br>
nipping line is denoted by the number 7, at which the staple fibre strand 2, fed n<br>
delivery direction A, is held nipped before it runs into the airjet aggregate 3. The<br>
lotter generates the twist for the thread 4 to be spun, and delivers the thread 4 in yarn<br>
withdrawal direcifon 8 by means of a withdrawal roller pair (not shown).<br>
The airjet aggregate 3 also compnses an airjet body 8 with a fibs transporting<br>
channel 8 and a vortex chamber 10. A fluid device generates a vortex current in the<br>
vortex chamber to by means of compressed air being blown in through air supply<br>
nozzwes 11 which run langenttially into the vortex chamber 10.  The compressed air<br>
exiting out of the mouths of the air supply nozzles 11 is removed via an air<br>
evacuation duct 12 which surrounds, in the manner of a circular ring, a staliona y<br>
spindle-like component 13. which in lum surrounds a yarn withdrawal channel 14.<br><br>
Downstream of an exit opaning 15 of Irte fibre transporting channel 9, a fibre deliver'<br>
edge 16 of a fiber guiding surface 17 is arranged as a twist block, which fiber guiding<br>
surface 17 is arranged eccentrically to the yarn withdrawal channel 14 in the erea of<br>
its enty opening 18.<br>
In the airjet aggregate 3, the fibres to be spun are held on the one hand in the staple<br>
fibre strand 2 and thus guided from the exit opening 15 of the fibre transporting<br>
channel 9 essentially without twist into the yarn withdrawal channel 14. On the other<br>
hand the fibres in the areg between the fibre transporting channel 9 and the yarn<br>
withdrawal channel 14 are subject to the effect of the vortex current, which causes<br>
the fibres of at least their end areas to be driven radially away from the entry opening<br>
18 of the yarn withdrawal channel 14. The threads 4 produced by the described<br>
process have a core of fibres, or fibre areas, extending essentially in thread<br>
XXX direction and without any significant twist, and an outer area in which the<br>
fibres or fibre areas are wound around the core.<br>
Basing the formation of the thread structure on an idealized process for the purposes,<br>
of greater clarity, the front ends of the fibres, in particular those rear areas still held<br>
upstream in the fibre transporting channel 9, essentially directly reach the yarn<br>
withdrawal channel 14, but rear fibre areas in particular when they are no longer<br>
held in the entry area of the fibre feed channel 9, are pulled out of the staple fibre<br>
strand 2 by the vortex formation and then wound around the forming thread 4. In and<br>
case, fibres aie bound into the forming thread 4. during which they are pulled through<br>
tne yarn withdrawal channel 14, while at the same time they are also subject to the<br>
vortex current, which accelerates them XXX. that is from the entry opening 11<br>
of the yarn withdrawal channel 14. and draws them into the air evacuation duct 12.<br>
The fibre areas pulled out or the staple fibre strand 2 by the vortex current form a<br>
fibre vortex which runs into the entry opening 18 of the yarn withdrawal channel 14;<br>
the longer parts of which wind themselves spiral-like around the spincle-shaped<br>
component 13 and are pulled in this spiral against the force of the current in the air<br>
evacuation duct 12 against the entry opening 16 of the yarn withdrawal channel 14.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Figures l and 3. there are four compressed.<br>
air supply nozzles 11 overall per airjet aggregate 3. which are each worked into the<br>
airjet body 8.  An XXX space 19 surrounding the airjet body 8 XXX is XXX<br>
to a source for compressed air in a way not shown.  The compressed air reaches the<br>
individual air supply nozzles 11 from the annuter space 19 via the recesses 20<br><br>
worked into the outer contour of the airjet body 8.    The annular XXX 19 is seated<br>
off from the outside by means of a wall of a housing 21.<br>
The fibre transporting channel 9 comprises an inlet opening 22, which, according to<br>
Figure 5, has a larger width parallel to the nipping line 7 of the delivery roller pair 5,-3<br>
than perpendicular thereto. Thus the fact that the staple fibre slrand 2 XXX into<br>
the airjet aggregate 3 has its larger width lengthwise of the nipping line 7. is inihally<br>
taken into consideration. In the fibre transporting channel 9 the staple fiber strand.2<br>
is guided along a fiber guiding surface 17. which comprises a deflecting edge 23 in<br>
its path. This results in a certain loosening of the transported staple fibre sirand 2<br>
before it runs a short distance over the fibre guiding- surface 17 aher it has exitel<br>
from the exit opening 15 of the fibre transporting channel 9, and ends directly<br>
upstream of the entry opening 18 of the yarn withdrawal channel 14 at a so-called<br>
fibre delivery edge 16, which functions as a twist block. This twist block is vital as it<br>
prevents the twist imparted to the thread 4 from running back towards the nipping line<br>
7 of the delivery roller pair 5.6.<br>
In order that the staple fibre strand 2 is sufficiently narrow and condensed to an<br>
optimal width before it reaches the entry opening 13 of the yarn withdrawal channel<br>
14, laterally bordering walls 24 and 25 are provided in the fibre transporting channel<br>
9 as can be seen in particular in Figure 3, which cause the fibre guiding surface17<br>
to become increasingly narrower and to reach its smallest width at the deflecting<br>
edge 23. With this embodiment, the inherent disadvantageous slubs in the above<br>
rnentioned prior art are avoided to a great extant, so that higher spinning and delivery<br>
speeds are also possible.<br>
In a variation according to Figure 4, it can be  seen that alternatively the fibre guiding<br>
surface 17 can reach a width which is at least approximately its narrowost at an inlet<br>
edge 26 arranged upstream of the deflecting edgc 23. This smallest width<br>
corresponds, for the purposes of the present invention, only twice to three times the<br>
diameter of the entry opening 18 of the yarn withdrawal channel 14.<br><br>
