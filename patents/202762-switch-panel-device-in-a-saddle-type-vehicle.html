COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SWITCH PANEL DEVICE IN A SADDLE TYPE VEHICLE"<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
device in a saddle type vehicle and particularly to a switch panel device mounted on a steering handle pipe and with plural switches concentrated thereon so as to permit a rider of the vehicle to operate the switches easily. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
In a saddle type vehicle having a saddle which a rider straddles, such as a large-sized two-wheeled motor vehicle or a three-wheeled vehicle for leisure, operating switches are sometimes disposed on a steering handle pipe so that the rider can operate the switches easily.  Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing an example of a conventional handle switch device.  In the same figure, a switch body 200 is mounted on a steering handle pipe adjacent to a left handle grip 14.  In the switch body 200 are provided indicating and warning switches such as a dimmer switch 201, a winker switch 202, a horn switch 203, and a hazard switch 204. Above the switch body 200 are disposed an audio switch unit 300 independently of the switch body.  The audio switch unit 300 comprises a channel selecting switch 301 and a muting switch 302. Such a switch device is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 7-19975. [0003]<br><br><br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing another example of a conventional handle switch device.  In the same figure, a switch panel 400 is provided separately from a switch body 200, and an audio switch 401 and a<br>
switch 402 for CB radio communication (simply "for CB" hereinafter) are provided on the switch panel 400 to meet a demand for an increase in the number of switches. [0004] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, if switches are stacked upward with an increase in the number of switches, the operability of the top-stage switch will be deteriorated. More particularly, in a state in which the rider grasps<br>
the grip 14, a finger of the rider' s left hand LH is difficult to reach the switch 402 for CB located at the top stage. Moreover, the audio switch 401 and the switch 402 for CB are often used in shapes similar to each other because both include similar functions such as volume control.  Therefore, in the example shown in Fig. 6 in which they are arranged side by side, it is not easy to distinguish one from the other, thus resulting in deterioration of operability.<br>
[0005]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br><br><br>
a switch panel device in a saddle type vehicle capable of solving the above-mentioned problems, enhancing the degree of integration of switches, facilitating the recognition of many switches and thereby attaining the improvement of operability.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a vehicle having a switch panel device, disposed near one of a pair of steering handle grips provided at the opposite left and right end portions of a steering handle bar of the vehicle said switch panel device being provided with a plurality of switch operating elements disposed on an operating surface, characterized in that:<br>
said plural switch operating elements are arranged separately in plural vertical columns on said operating surface each vertical column comprising several switch operating elements out of said plural switch operating elements, those for activating a vehicular indicating and warning system are allocated to a column closest to said steering handle grip and the other switch operating elements are allocated to the remaining column or columns.<br><br><br>

A perspective view showing another example of a conventional handle switch.<br><br>
[0006] [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
For achieving the above-mentioned object, the first feature of the present invention resides in a switch panel device in a saddle type vehicle, disposed near a steering handle grip of the vehicle and with a plurality of switch operating elements disposed on an operating surface, wherein the plural switch operating elements are arranged separately in plural vertical columns on the operating surface, and out of the plural switch operating elements, those for a vehicular indicating and warning system are allocated to a column closest to the steering handle grip and the other switch operating elements are allocated to the remaining column or columns. [0007]<br>
According to the first feature of the invention, since switch operating element for an indicating and warning system, which require urgency and whose frequency of use is high, are allocated to the column closest to<br><br>
the handle grip, it is possible to effect urgent operations or frequent operations.<br>
[0008]<br>
The second feature of the present invention resides in a switch panel device in a saddle type vehicle, disposed near a steering handle grip of the vehicle and with a plurality of switch operating elements disposed on an operating surface, wherein the plural switch operating elements are arranged separately in a total of four or more stages including a stage set on a horizontal line passing through a handle pipe to which the steering handle is to be connected and stages positioned above and below the stage, and out of the plural switch operating elements, those for a vehicular indicating and warning system are allocated to the stage set on a horizontal line passing through the handle pipe and also to stages adjacent above and below the stage, and the other switch operating elements are allocated to the remaining stage or stages.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to the second feature of the invention, when a vehicle driver is going to operate a switch operating element for the indicating and warning system, all that is required of a rider is merely extending his<br><br><br>
or her thumb horizontally while grasping the grip.  By so doing, the rider's thumb will reach the switches concentrated at that horizontal position or thereabouts and thus it becomes possible for the rider to operate the switch operating element to be operated.<br>
[0010]<br>
Further, the third feature of the present invention resides in a switch panel device in a saddle type vehicle, disposed near a steering handle grip of the vehicle and with a plurality of switch operating elements disposed on an operating surface, wherein the plural switch operating elements include switch operating elements for an indicating and warning system, an audio system and a radio communication system, which switch operating elements are arranged vertically in two or more columns and horizontally in three or more stages, and the switch operating elements for the audio system and the radio communication system are allocated to the column and stage remotest from the steering handle grip.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the third feature of the invention, since the switch operating elements for the audio systems whose urgency and frequency of use are relatively low are allocated to a position remote from the handle grip, the<br><br>
switch operating elements for the indicating and warning system whose importance is high are allocated relatively to a position close to the handle grip. Therefore, even where a large number of switch operating elements are disposed, it is possible to utilize the operating surface of the switch panel and thereby ensure a satisfactory operability. [0012] [Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.  Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a two-wheeled motor vehicle with a switch panel device according to an embodiment of the present invention mounted thereon.  In the same figure, a steering handle (simply "handle" hereinafter) 1 is fixed to an upper portion of a front fork (not shown) whose lower end journals a front wheel 2, and it is a separate type handle comprising a left handle IL and a right handle IR.  In front of the handle 1 is mounted a front fairing 3 which covers a display panel and a lamp device, and a windscreen 4 is mounted on top of the front fairing 3.<br>
[0013] Near the grip of the right handle IR is disposed a<br><br><br>
right switch panel 12 which is provided with a starter, a reverse switch and a reverse shift switch. Near the grip of the left handle IL is disposed a left switch panel 13 which includes a group of indicating and warning switches, a group of audio switches, and a group of switches for CB. The audio switches are for operating a radio, a CD player, and a tape deck. As to the left switch panel 13, a further description will be given later. [0014]<br>
A fuel tank 5, a rider seat 6, a fellow passenger seat 7, and a rear box 8 are disposed in this order from the front fairing 3 toward the rear of the vehicle body. Below the fuel tank 5 is mounted an engine 9, while below the rear box 8 is positioned a rear wheel 10 and side boxes 11 are mounted so as to cover the right and left sides of an upper portion of the rear wheel 10. [0015]<br>
A detailed description will now be given about the left switch panel 13 mounted on the left handle IL.  Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the left handle which includes the left switch panel 13 and Fig. 2 is a front view of the left switch panel 13.  In Fig. 1, the left handle IL is made up of a mounting portion la fixed to a top bridge (not shown), an intermediate portion Im extending<br><br>
obliquely leftwards from the mounting portion la, and a handle pipe portion Ip extending further leftwards and nearly horizontally from the intermediate portion Im. A handle grip 14 is provided on a still left-hand side of the handle pipe portion Ip.  The left switch panel 13 is disposed adjacent the handle grip 14 on the handle pipe portion Ip so that the rider can easily operate the left switch panel with his or her left hand LH while grasping the handle grip 14.<br>
[0016]<br>
In Fig. 2, an indicating and warning switch group 15 is disposed on the front left side of the left switch panel 13, that is, in the column closes to the handle grip 14.  The indicating and warning switch group 15 comprises a horn switch 151 positioned at the lowest stage, an overlying winker switch 152, and a still overlying dimmer switch 153.  On the right side of the indicating and warning switch group 15, that is, in a column positioned away from the handle grip 14, is disposed an audio switch group 16.  The audio switch group comprises a muting switch 161 positioned at the lowest stage, an overlying channel selecting switch 162, and a still overlying volume control 163.<br>
[0017]<br><br>
Above the indicating and warning switch group 15 and the audio switch group 16 is further disposed a switch group 17 for CB.  The CB switch group 17 comprises a CB volume control 171, a CB channel switch 172, and a CB squelch switch 173. As is seen from Fig. 1, an operating surface of the CB switch group 17 is in a position slightly turned clockwise in plan with respect to operating surfaces of the other switch groups 15 and 16, with an inclination given in the direction of the handle grip 14.  This inclination facilitates an arcuate motion of a finger F when only the finger F is moved while the left hand LH is fixed to the grip handle 14. Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram for understanding the arrangement of switches on the left switch panel 13, in which the same reference numerals as in Fig. 2 represent the same portions.  In Fig. 3, switches are roughly arranged vertically in two columns and horizontally in four stages, which are a column LI close to the handle grip 14, a column L2 away from the handle grip 14, and stages SI, S2, S3, and S4.  Of these stages, the stage S2 is set on a horizontal line passing through the handle pipe portion Ip, and the other stage SI and stages S3, S4 are set respectively below and above the stage S2.<br>
[0018]<br><br>
The indicating and warning switch group 15 whose frequency of operation is high is disposed on the column LI and the audio switch group 16 whose frequency of operation is presumed to be lower is disposed on the column L2.  The CB switch group 17 is disposed on the stage S4.  Further, the indicating and warning switch group 15 and the audio switch group 16 are disposed on the stages SI and S3 below and above the stage S2.<br>
[0019]<br>
Thus, the switches of the indicating and warning switch group 15 are concentrated near the handle grip 14. Therefore, when a quick motion is required, for example, when giving an indication at the time of frequent direction changing or giving a warning in an emergency, it is easy for the vehicle rider to extend his or her thumb and operate the switch concerned while grasping the handle grip 14.<br>
[0020]<br>
Besides, since the switch groups 15 to 17 are each arranged in a horizontal row or vertical column, their switches can be identified easily.  Particularly, since the audio switch group 16 is disposed vertically, while the CB switch group 17 is disposed horizontally, even when the respective switches are similar in shape, it is<br><br>
possible to easily distinguish between both switch groups, that is, malfunction is difficult to occur.<br>
[0021] [Effect of the Invention]<br>
As will be apparent from the above description, according to the invention defined in claims 1 to 3, since a plurality of switch operating elements are arranged separately in columns or stages, it is easy to distinguish them from one another and hence the operability is improved.<br>
[0022]<br>
Particularly, in the invention defined in claim 1, since switch operating elements for the indicating and warning system, which require urgency and whose frequency of use is high, are allocated to the column closest to the handle grip, it is possible to easily perform a required motion in an emergency or perform frequent operations.<br>
[0023]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 2, when the switch operating elements for the indicating and warning system are to be operated, all that is required is merely extending  the  rider's    thumb horizontally while grasping the handle grip, whereby the rider's thumb can<br><br><br>
reach and operate the switch operating elements which are concentrated in that horizontal position.<br>
[0024]<br>
Further, according to the invention defined in claim 3, since the switch operating elements for the audio system and radio communication system which are relatively low in urgency and frequency of use are allocated to a position remote from the handle grip, the switch operating elements for the indicating and warning system whose importance is high are allocated relatively to a position near the handle grip.  Therefore, even where a large number of switch operating elements are arranged, it is possible to utilize the operating surface of the switch panel effectively and ensure a satisfactory operability.<br><br>
