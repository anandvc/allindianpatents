				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to development of an antiulcer herbal composition(s), process of preparing the extracts useful for preparing herbal formulation to treat ulcers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Peptic ulcer represents a major health problem, both in terms of morbidity and mortality. Research advances during the last decade have offered new insights in the therapy and prevention of gastroduodenal ulceration by measures directed at strengthening the mucosal defense system rather than by attenuating the aggressive acid-pepsin factors held responsible for the induction of ulcers. The rise in gastric acidity and peptic activity are usually a manifestation of a physiological disturbance affecting one or more mechanisms which normally regulate gastric secretion. Neurotransmitters or hormones that directly stimulate secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsin by the gastric glands are acetylcholine, gastrin and histamine. In addition there are other factors which play an important role in the manifestation of peptic ulcers. Activity of the gastric secretary cells has been found to be stimulated by caffeine, alcohol, hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and stress3'4'5.<br>
The recent daily life is called a stress age and the chances of receiving stress have been increased by the kaleidoscopic change of the living environment and the increase of the complexity of personal relations. Also, the chance of taking many virtual, which do not exist in nature has been increased2.<br>
Thus, the number of persons suffering from a stomach ulcer, a duodenal ulcer, etc., by these factors has been increased and various antiulcer agents have been developed and utilized at present. The antiulcer agents which have been used at present are largely classified into a digestive power depressant, a gastric juice secretion depressant, a mucous membrane protective tissue reparative agent, etc., and are orally or subcutaneously administered. However, these preparations are isolated medicaments or synthesized medicaments, each medicament has each side effects, whereby the â€¢restrictions about the applicable objects and the using amount become severe, and an effective and safe antiulcer agent has not yet been developed and utilized1.<br><br>
Thus, since these conventional antiulcer agents can not be regularly used from the point of the safety, they can not be utilized for the prophylaxis and the recurrence prevention.<br>
On the other hand, as preventives for ulcer, medicines for intestinal disorders and<br>
medicaments having the secretion preventing effect of gastric juice only are used and<br>
hence,    they    are    not    said    to    be    preventives    for    a    ulcer    in    true    meaning.<br>
At present, side effects of medicaments to a human being become a problem and hence the<br>
development of a medicament having an antiulcer effect, which is a natural product, gives<br>
no side effects, and is sufficiently safe even when the medicament is regularly used as a<br>
preventive or a recurring preventing agent has been required1'2.<br>
Hitherto only on oral tradition of Malasar and Kadar tribes of Kerala use Utleria solifolia<br>
for treatment of intestinal ailments like colic and bleeding in stomach. The synthetic<br>
conventional drugs either inhibit acid secretion or cure the ulcer. The long term treatment<br>
of the present synthetic drugs completely inhibits the acid and pepsin secretion which is<br>
normally responsible for digestion and function of stomach and causes cancer.  The<br>
offensive acid, pepsin and defensive mucin of the stomach plays a critical role in stomach<br>
function. The Helicobacter pylori bacteria, offensive acid, pepsin, consumption of hot food<br>
disrupts the continuity of the cells and leads to ulcer and gastric cancer, yet there is no<br>
complete cure. Therefore for the treatment of acute gastric/duodenal ulcer, and H. pylori, a<br>
novel herbal formulation is required. Accordingly studies were undertaken to develop a<br>
oral formulation containing herbal drugs along with additives for oral ingestion6'7 to treat<br>
acute gastric/duodenal ulcer and also to treat internal bleeding.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention to provide a novel anti-ulcer herbal formulation<br>
useful for the treatment of acute and chronic ulcers of stomach and duodenum<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare herbal formulation(s) that gives<br>
immediate relieves the acidity of the stomach by neutralizing the excess acid.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare herbal formulation(s) with a<br>
combination  of the  plants  which  are  used  in  diarrhea,   intestinal   discomforts   and<br>
antimicrobial.<br>

The first step in the preparation of these formulations involves a process for making, the plant material suitable for formulating into a tablet/ capsule. The specified portion of the<br>
plant is collected and dried under shade at room temperature (25 -35Â°C) for 72 hours or until the material gets dried. The material is then powdered into a fine powdered. A specified amount of the powdered material is then extracted exhaustively with 50 % aqueous alcohol at room temperature (25-35 Â°C). Extraction was carried out in a closed container immersing specified amount of the plant material in specified solvent (1:8-1:15 ratio) for 4-7 days. At the end of this stage, solvent is decanted and filtered if necessary to make it free from plant debris. The solvent is then concentrated by evaporating under vacuum at less than 40-60Â°C. The concentrate is then freeze dried to obtain final product in powder form. The final product is then made into oral dosage form by using it as an ingredient for making tablets and capsules. Suitable binders like starch and diluents lite lactose are added to make up the formulation. EXAMPLE- 1<br>

The formulation is useful for the treatment of acute and chronic gastric and duodenal ulcers and internal bleeding Procedures for antiulcer activity screening:<br><br>
1.	Ethanol  induced  ulcers:   The   gastric   ulcers   were   induced  in  rats   by<br>
administering ethanol (1 ml/200g, 1 h) and the animals were sacrificed by<br>
cervical dislocation and stomach was incised along the greater curvature and<br>
examined for ulcers.<br>
2.	Aspirin induced ulcers: Aspirin in dose of 200 mg/kg was administered to the<br>
animals and ulcers were scored after 4 hours. The stomach was taken out and<br>
cut open along with greater curvature and the ulcers were scored by a person<br>
unaware of experimental protocol in the glandular portion of the stomach.<br>
3.	Cold restraint stress - induced ulcers: Rats were strapped on a wooden plank<br>
and kept them at 4-6 Â°C for 2 hours. The animals were then sacrificed by<br>
cervical dislocation and ulcers were scored on the dissected stomach.<br>
4.	Pylorus   ligated   induced   ulcers:   Animals   were   anaesthetized   using<br>
pentobarbitione (35mg/kg, i.p.), the abdomen was opened and pylorus ligation<br>
was done without causing any damage to its blood supply. The stomach was<br>
replaced carefully and the abdomen wall was closed in 2  layers with<br>
interrupted sutures. The animals were deprived of water during postoperative<br>
period. After 4 hours stomach were dissected out and contents were collected<br>
and ulcer index was calculated.<br>
5.	Acetic acid induced ulcers: The rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone<br>
(35 mg/kg, i.p.). The abdomen was opened and the stomach was visualized.<br>
Cylindrical glass tube of 6 mm diameter was tightly placed upon the anterior<br>
serosal surface of the glandular portion on the stomach 1 cm away from the<br>
pyloric end. 50 % acetic acid (0.06 ml/ animal) was instilled into the tube and<br>
allowed to remain 60 s on the gastric wall. After removal of the acid solution,<br>
the abdomen was closed in 2 layers and animals were caged and fed normally.<br>
The animals were sacrificed after the last dose of treatment either on 6th or 11th<br>
of day of experiment to assess the ulcer size healing. Ulcer index was<br>
calculated based upon the product of length and width (mm2/ rat) of ulcers.<br>
6.	Cysteamine induced duodenal ulcers: Cysteamine in 2 doses of 400 mg/ Kg<br>
of 4 intervals time were administered to induce duodenal ulcers. The animals<br>
were sacrificed after drug treatment ant: .voserved for the presence or absence<br>
of ulcers.<br><br>
