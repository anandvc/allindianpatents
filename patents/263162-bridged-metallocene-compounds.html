Metallocene compounds<br>
The present invention relates to a class of bridged bis indenyl metallocene compounds having C2 symmetry, wherein the indenyl moieties are in particular substituted in position 4 by a phenyl moiety and in positions 5 and 6 by a condensed ring, the present invention further relates to the catalyst system thereof and the polymerization process therefrom. Metallocene compounds are well known in the art as catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins. WO 03/050131 relates to a class of bis indenyl metallocene compounds wherein the indenyl moieties are at least substituted in position 4 and 5. However WO 03/050131 does not report that the substituents on positions 5 and 6 can form a condensed ring. PCT/EP03/12236 relates to a bis indenyl metallocene compound substituted at least in positions 2 5 and 6, wherein the substituents in positions 5 and 6 form a condensed ring. However the substituent in position 4 is defined only in a generic way and in the compounds exemplified in the examples it is always a hydrogen atom. In PCT/EP2004/013827 a class of bis indenyl metallocene compounds wherein the indenyl moieties are substituted in position 5 and 6 by a condensed ring is disclosed. PCT/EP2004/013827 is mainly focused on Ci symmetric structures and there are no explicit disclosures of C2 symmetric compounds. In other words this document is focused on metallocene compounds comprising two cyclopentadienyl moieties having different substitution pattern.<br>

Organic aluminum compounds used as compound c) are those of formula HJA1U3-J or<br>

The catalysts of the present invention can also be supported on an inert carrier. This is<br>
achieved by depositing the metallocene compound a) or the product of the reaction thereof<br>
with the component b), or the component b) and then the metallocene compound a) on an<br>
inert support. The support can be a porous solid such as talc, a sheet silicate, an inorganic<br>
oxide or a finely divided polymer powder (e.g. polyolefin). Suitable inorganic oxides may<br>
be found among the oxides of elements of groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the<br>
Periodic Table of the Elements. Examples of oxides preferred as supports include silicon<br>
dioxide, aluminum oxide, and also mixed oxides of the elements calcium, aluminum,<br>
silicon, magnesium or titanium and also corresponding oxide mixtures, magnesium<br>
halides,   styrene/divinylbenzene   copolymers,   polyethylene   or   polypropylene.   Other<br>
inorganic oxides which can be used alone or in combination with the abovementioned<br>
preferred oxidic supports are, for example, MgO, Z1O2, T1O2 or B2O3.<br>
A suitable class of supports which can be used is that constituted by porous organic supports<br>
ftinctionalized with groups having active hydrogen atoms. Particularly suitable are those in<br>
which the organic support is a partially crosslinked styrene polymer. Supports of this type<br>
are described in European application EP-633 272.<br>
Another class of inert, supports particularly suitable for use according to the invention is that<br>
of polyolefin porous prepolymers, particularly polyethylene.<br><br>
A further suitable class of inert supports for use according to the invention is that of porous magnesium halides such as those described in International application WO 95/32995. The support materials used preferably have a specific surface area in the range from 10 to 1 000 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.1 to 5 ml/g and a mean particle size of from 1 to 500 |im. Preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 50 to 500 m /g, a pore volume in the range from 0.5 to 3.5 ml/g and a mean particle size in the range from 5 to 350 |im. Particular preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 200 to 400 m /g, a pore volume in the range from 0.8 to 3.0 ml/g and a mean particle size of from 10 to 100 \xm. The inorganic support can be subjected to a thermal treatment, e.g. to remove adsorbed water. Such a drying treatment is generally carried out at from 80 to 300°C, preferably from 100 to 200°C, with drying at from 100 to 200°C preferably being carried out under reduced pressure and/or a blanket of inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), or the inorganic support can be calcined at from 200 to 1 000°C to produce the desired structure of the solid and/or set the desired OH concentration on the surface. The support can also be treated chemically using   customary   desiccants   such   as   metal   alkyls,   preferably   aluminum   alkyls, chlorosilanes or SiCU, or else methylaluminoxane. Appropriate treatment methods are described, for example, in WO 00/31090.<br>
The inorganic support material can also be chemically modified. For example, treatment of silica gel with (NH^SiFe leads to fluorination of the silica gel surface, or treatment of silica gels with silanes containing nitrogen-, fluorine- or sulfur-containing groups leads to correspondingly modified silica gel surfaces.<br>
Organic support materials such as finely divided polyolefin powders (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene) can also be used and are preferably likewise freed of adhering moisture, solvent residues or other impurities by means of appropriate purification and drying operations before use. It is also possible to use fiinctionalized polymer supports, e.g. supports based on polystyrene, via whose functional groups, for example ammonium or hydroxy groups, at least one of the catalyst components can be immobilized. The solid compound obtained by supporting the catalyst system object of the present invention on a carrier in combination with the further addition of the alkylaluminium compound either as such or prereacted with water if necessary, can be usefully employed in<br><br>
the gas-phase or slurry polymerization.<br>
Therefore a further object of the present invention is a catalyst system as described above,<br>
further comprising d) an inert carrier.<br>
The catalyst system comprising the metallocene compound of formula (I) can be used for<br>
polymerizing olefins, in particular alpha-olefins in high yields to obtain polymers having<br>
high molecular weight. Therefore a further object of the present invention is a process for<br>
preparing a alpha-olefin polymer comprising contacting under polymerization conditions<br>
one or more alpha-olefins of formula CH2=CHA wherein A is hydrogen or a C1-C20 alkyl<br>
radical, in the presence of a catalyst system as described above.<br>
Non limitative examples of alpha-olefins of formula CH2=CHA are: ethylene, propylene, 1-<br>
butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-methyl-l-pentene, preferred alpha olefins are ethylene<br>
propylene and 1 -butene.<br>
The metallocene compounds of formula (I) object of the present invention are particularly<br>
suitable for the homo and copolymerization of propylene. In fact, the metallocene-based<br>
catalyst system of the present invention when used for homo or copolymerizing<br>
propylene are able to give polymers having a high molecular weight in high yields also at<br>
high temperatures rendering thus possible to use it in the industrial plants that use<br>
polymerization temperatures higher than 50°C and that can be comprised between 60 and<br>
120°C.<br>
As said above the metallocene compounds of formula (I) are particularly suitable for the<br>
copolymerization of propylene, therefore a farther object of the present invention is a<br>
process for the preparation of propylene copolymers  comprising the step of contacting,<br>
under polymerization conditions, propylene with ethylene or one or more alpha olefins of<br>
formula CH2=CHA1, wherein A1 is a C2-C20 alkyl radical, in the presence of a catalyst<br>
system described above.<br>
Examples of alpha olefins of formula CH2=CHA] are 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-<br>
methyl-1-pentene, preferred alpha olefins are ethylene and 1-butene; more preferred<br>
alpha olefin is ethylene.<br>
The content of alpha-olefins derived units in the propylene copolymer object of the<br>
present invention ranges from 0.1 to 90% by mol; preferably it ranges from 5% by mol to<br>
70% by mol; more preferably it ranges from 10% by mol to 60% by mol.<br><br>
The metallocene compounds of the present invention are also particularly suitable for the preparation of copolymers of ethylene and higher alpha olefins, such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene. The copolymers have a comonomer content ranging from 5 to 50% by mol. Particularly preferred are ethylene/1-butene copolymer having a content of 1-butene derive units ranging from 5 to 50% by mol. Said copolymers can be obtained in high yields by using a gas phase process such a fluidized bed or stirred bed reactor. The process for the polymerization of olefins according to the invention can be carried out in slurry or in the gas phase. The hydrocarbon solvent can either be aromatic such as toluene, or aliphatic such as propane, hexane, heptane, or isobutane.<br>
The polymerization temperature is generally comprised between -100°C and +200°C and, particularly between 10°C and +100°C. The polymerization pressure is generally comprised between 0,5 and 100 bar.<br>
The lower the polymerization temperature, the higher are the resulting molecular weights of the polymers obtained.<br>
The polymerization yields depend on the purity of the metallocene compound. The metallocene compounds obtained by the process of the invention can therefore be used as such or can be subjected to purification treatments.<br>
When the metallocene compounds of the present invention are used as catalyst component in a polymerization process the activity of the catalyst system is strongly activated by the presence of hydrogen. This feature is even more important if it is considered that the molecular weight of the obtained polymer is not influenced in a considerable way by this addiction and it remains quite high for industrial use even in the presence of high amount of hydrogen. Thus a further object of the present invention is a process for preparing a alpha-olefin polymer comprising contacting under polymerization conditions one or more alpha-olefins of formula CH2=CHA wherein A is hydrogen or a C1-C20 alkyl radical, in the presence of a catalyst system as described above wherein the polymerization reaction I scarried out in the presence of hydrogen. Preferably the amount of hydrogen ranges from 0.5 NL (normal liter) to 10 NL; even more preferably it ranges from 4.5 NL to 8 NL.

Ubbelohde viscometer PVS 1 with an S 5 measuring head (both from Lauda) in decalin at<br>

Preparation of supported catalyst system<br><br>
6,3 g SiOs are placed in a round flask equipped with a KPG stirrer and suspended at 0 °C in 30 ml toluene. Via a dropping funnel 15.1 ml MAO are slowly added at 0 °C. After addition, the suspension is allowed to come to room temperature (RT), and is then stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture is placed in a stirred glass flask equipped with filter (size P3), where the solvent is filtered off. The residual is suspended in 20 ml toluene, stirred for 15 min at room temperature, and filtered. The support is suspended in 20 ml toluene, then brought to 80°C, and stirred for 30 min at this temperature before hot filtration. Again, the support is suspended in 20 ml toluene, then brought to 80°C, and stirred for 30 min at this temperature before hot filtration. The MAO/silica is suspended at 15 °C in 20 ml toluene. Under stirring, a solution of 0.25 mmol (207 mg, 40|amol/g carrier) of the metallocene indicated in table 1 in 2 ml MAO and 2 ml toluene is slowly added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h at 15 °C, and after raising the temperature to 40 °C, again stirred for 2 h. Then, it is filtered. The residual solid is washed 3 times at 60 °C with 20 ml toluene each (stirring: 3 x 30 min). After the last filtration, the reaction product is transferred with some toluene into a glass frit (size P3), and filtered again. The catalyst is transfer after drying at RT in high vacuum until weight constant. Polymerization examples 1-2 (multistep polymerization) Step a)<br>
A 2.5 L autoclave, previously kept overnight under nitrogen purge, is added with 2 mmol Triethylaluminum (TEA) (as 10% w/v hexane solution) as reactor scavenger. Also 0.5 bar-g of propylene are fed to prevent air insertion in the reactor.<br>
Prepolymerization: 252 g propylene are fed in the autoclave at 0°C. The catalytic system is injected in the reactor and propylene is prepolymerized at 30°C for 5 minutes. At the end of this step the reactor temperature was raised from 30 to 70°C (in 10 minutes). During the temperature increase also 59 cc H2 are fed, corresponding to 2.63 mmol H2. Propylene polymerization in bulk this step is carried out at 30bar-g pressure and 70°C until the liquid propylene is totally consumed, and the pressure inside the reactor starts to decrease. When this step is completed, the PP matrix polymerization time is recorded and the pressure is released down to 0.1 bar-g propylene; at the same time the temperature decreases to 30°C. Step b)<br><br>
Ethylene and propylene at a molar ratio ethylene(C2)/propylene(C3)-i-ethylene(C2) of 0.3<br>
are feed in the reactor to reach the pressure of 21 bar-g then the temperature is raised to<br>
60°C and the ethylene/propylene mixture is feed at constant pressure until 232g of<br>
monomers are consumed.<br>
Then the reactor is vented and cooled down to room temperature; thus, the reaction is<br>
stopped. The polymer is collected and dried at reduced pressure and 60°C.<br>
The resulting polymer has been subjected to xylene extraction at 25°C according to the<br>
procedure described above. The fraction of polymer soluble in xylene at 25°C has been<br>
taken as the amount of ethylene propylene copolymers produced in the process. The<br>
polymerization data are reported in table 1<br><br>

Prepolymerization: 134 g propylene are fed in the autoclave at 0°C. The catalytic system is injected in the reactor and propylene is prepolymerized at 30°C for 5 minutes. At the end of this step the reactor temperature was raised from 30 to 80°C (in 10 minutes). Propylene polymerization in gas phase: this step is carried out at 21 bar-g pressure and 80°C until 70 grams of propylene are consumed and the pressure inside the reactor starts to decrease. When this step is completed, the PP matrix polymerization time is recorded and the pressure is released down to 0.1 bar-g propylene; at the same time the temperature decreases to 30°C.<br><br>

Example 6 propylene homopolymcrization Preparation of the catalyst system<br>
0.206mmol of a metallocene dichloride (A-l) were added at room temperature to 4.33mmol of MAO (30% strength solution in toluene, from Albemarle). The solution was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature and was subsequently diluted with 10.9ml of toluene. The diluted solution was carefully added to lOg of silica (Sylopol 948, calcined at 600°C, from Grace). Particular attention was paid to the colored solution being uniformly distributed over the support material. After 10 minutes, the flask containing the catalyst suspension was connected to a vacuum line and dried until the content of volatile material had been reduced to less than 5% by weight.

step needs about 10 minutes.<br>
Step c)<br><br>
The ethylene/propylene mixture is fed at constant pressure for 60 minutes. Then the reactor is vented and cooled down to room temperature; thus, the reaction is stopped. The polymer is collected and dried at reduced pressure and 60°C.<br>
