				<td>PRINTING WEB CLEANER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to web cleaning in general and more specifically to a treatment system that lifts debris from the surface of a web of substrate material without touching either of its upper and lower surfaces.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Previously, many types of web cleaners have been used to provide an effective means for removing unwanted particles from the surface of a web in the printing discipline, A number of approaches have been in used with limited or little success. Bristles, hi the form of a brush rotating at a speed of some 600 to 800 rpm have been employed that lightly brush the surface of the web. Compressed air has been tried that was somewhat successful, however it was found that it required almost 2 pounds per square inch of pressure, which required considerable energy and had other complications. The combination of a rotating brush and vacuum was considered to be a viable solution, however it was also complicated and required vacuum blowers at high volume and brushes that contacted the surface of the web.<br>
A search of the prior art did not disclose any patents that possess the novelty of<br>
the instant invention, however the following U.S. patents are considered related:<br>

Ziegelmuller et al. hi U.S. patent 6,195,527 teaches a web cleaning device with a nesting structure that supports a coil of web fabric. A lip member forms a part of the nesting structure and a pay out end of the coil is wrapped around the lip member with a take up spindle spaced from the coil.<br>
Patent No. 6,207,227 issued to Russo, et al presents a cleaning sheet with tacky surface coating that cleans feed rollers<br>
Patent No. 6,259,882 of Lindblad, et ai is for removing electrostatically charged particles from a surface of an image bearing belt.<br>
Patent No. 6,598,261 issued to Howard is the patent to which the improvement is directed. The patent discloses a web cleaner for removing debris from the surface of a substrate in a printing process without touching the web. The web within the press is moving at high speeds and counter rotating rollers are positioned between idlers with each roller rotating hi an opposite direction to that of the web's flowpath. A plenum collects the debris and is accumulated in a dust collector under negative pressure.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the discipline of offset printing in the lithographic process blanket piling is a source of wasted time and lost production due to the necessity of frequent blanket washes. Lint, paper fibers and coating on the surface of the substrate cause halftone plugging and so called "hickeys" which requires removal and washing of the blanket. Frequent blanket washes shorten the blankets life and places unnecessary wear and premature deterioration of tile printing press.<br>
In view of the above disclosure it is therefore a primary object of the invention to completely clean the surface of the web prior to entering the print unit which considerably reduces blanket washing. It has been found that the invention can increase the number of impressions run before a blanket wash is required.<br>
An important object of the invention is directed to condition high speed webs by penetrating the air boundary layer of the web without actual contact. The invention produces an air flow that directs the air currents in a turbulent washing film over the web surface, thus completely removing slitter dust, loose clay coaling and other debris. The invention is designed to be completely functional with almost any substrate used in printing without damage to its delicate surface such as paper, mylar and plastic.<br>
Another object of the invention is to apply the use of air currents that are produced by rollers with either a smooth or a textured surface. The roller creates a narrow, turbulent area immediately at an extreme close space existing between the roller and the web which, due to a limited sector develops immense energy to the web that dislodges debris and moves loose particles without actually touching the web. The rollers may have any plain, smooth or textured surface that will cause air movement above its surface, however, it has been found by extensive testing that a roller similar to a polishing wheel which is constructed of soft buffing material when rotated at a differential speed of at least 9,84 feet per second, (3 metres per second) has proven optimum. Once the contaminants are lifted from the surface of the web they may be easily directed to a separate device that receives and stores the debris.<br>
Still another object of the invention is that the rollers rotate in the opposite direction as the moving web, this feature permits the air currents that surround the rotating roller to be easily directed into a plenum, which includes a bar that directs the air containing particles that have been removed from the web from the roller into a plenum or dust collector device.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is that its use tfltimately permits print quality to be enhanced and more consistent color to be obtained with a clean web surface. The conditioned web, as provided by the cleaner, reduces contamination in not only the ink train and dampers but specifically the blankets and the printing plates of the printing equipment.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention wttl become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims taken hi conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The best mode for carrying out the invention is presented in terms of a preferred embodiment which is shown in FIGURES 1 through 15, and that consists of a web cleaner 20 that is used for removing particles and other debris from the surface of a<br>
substrate web 22 used in a printing press 24. It should be noted that while the invention is specifically designed for use in conjunction with a lithographic press used for effect printing, other presses and printing equipment including letterpress, flexographic, gravure, ink jet or laser, or any other apparatus that utilizes a web requiring cleaning, may benefit equally well.<br>
A plurality of path rollers 26, in the form of cylinders are employed in the invention, in which a web 22 of substrate material is held taut therebetween as shown pictorially in FIGURES 1 and 2. The location of the path rollers 26 and their relative position is determined by the configuration of the printing press and may vary randomly to accommodate a particular application. The web 22 is driven at high speeds by the printing press 24. FIGURES 9-11 illustrates a few combinations depending on where the web 22 enters and departs, such as from the top or bottom or straight through horizontally. The web cleaner 20 may be angled to correspond with the flowpath of the web 22, as shown in FIGURE 11. The use of the path roller 26 is in common practice in the industry today and its construction is well known.<br>
The web substrate material may be of any type used for printing or other industrial applications where a clean surface is required. The most common material consists of paper, mylar or thermoplastic film.<br>
A pau: of counter rotating rollers 28 are positioned between the path rollers 26, as illustrated in FIGURES 1-3 and 7-11, with one roller 28 unchangeably fixed on each side of the web 22 in close proximity therewith. The feet that the rollers 28 are fixed in then-relative position between each other and the web 22 is a distinct advantage and contributes to the novelty of the invention in that it is unnecessary to continually adjust the span of the rollers as is the case with other approaches in the cleaning Industry. In the invention the surface of the cleaning rollers do not touch the web surface and there is therefore no wear of the cleaning roller surfaces. Through experimentation it has been proven that the close proximity of the rollers 28 from .001 inch (.0254 mm) to .200 inch (5.08 mm) on each side of the web 22 functions properly. Although the cleaning function occurs over a wide range of differential roller/web speeds for maximum efficiency the lowest gap requires that the speed differential between the web 22 and the roller surface<br>
speed be at least 9.75 feet per second (3 metres per second) and for the larger gap the speed differential should be at least 35.75 feet per second ( 11 metres per second). This means that at the lowest speed differential, the rollers need to be as close as possible and at higher speeds the gap therebetween can be considerably greater.<br>
Further each roller 28 rotates in an opposite direction to that of the web's 22 flowpath and when the roller surface speed exceeds the paper web 22 speed actual removal of debris commences. At a differential of 9.75 feet per second (3 metres per second) to 35.75 feet per second (11 metres per second) sufficient turbulence is created hi the area surrounding the periphery of the roller 28 to produce air currents that flow turbulently away from the roller 28. This phenomenon is used to clean the surface of the web 22 using the natural air movement to its best advantage by impinging evenly on the web surface the entire length of the roller without any other source of compressed air required.<br>
The pair of counter rotating rollers 28 each have a peripheral speed that is greater than the speed of the moving web 22 which creates turbulence at the appropriate focused position simultaneously on both the top and bottom of the web 22.<br>
Each counter rotating roller 28 may be smooth 29 or textured such as fabric-tufted buffing material 30 surrounding the outside surface, which is capable of creating a fihn of air currents. While the above material has been selected as having the optimum characteristics, other surfaces may also be used such as resilient blades 32 or a continuous irregular surface 34 on the outer periphery of sufficient variance to create the necessary film of air currents. The irregular surface 34 could be any type of superficies such as raised scoops, fingers, flaps, bumps or even a matrix of grooves or the like. However, an advantage of the fabric-tufted buffing wheel material 30 is that when rotating it is safe for the operator to work around, as there is nothing on its rotating surface that could injure a person even if touched when turning at full speed. It should be noted that the fabric tufted buffing material 30, is illustrated in FIGURE 4, the resilient blades 32 are depicted in FIGURE 5 and the irregular surface 34, is pictorially shown in FIGURE 6.<br>
In addition, it should be noted that it is not necessary for the invention that the counter rotating rollers are opposite each other. A layout can be made where a back-up<br>
roller or a plate or other mechanism which ensures mat the web is positioned correctly with respect to the buff or cleaning roller and therefore a system of arrangement can be made to clean just one side of the web. Then optionally at a later position within the machine, the opposite side of the web can be cleaned, or the same side could be cleaned again if required.<br>
A separating bar 36 is positioned on an upstream side at an angle between 90 degrees to 180 degrees to the web 22 bordering each roller 28 in immediate adjacent relationship therewith as shown in FIGURES 2 and 7. The purpose of each separating bar 36 is to direct the particle laden air away from the web 22 in the direction of rotation of the roller 28. As illustrated, the separating bar 36 has a length at least that of the roller 28 and includes a blunt edge 38, shown in FIGURE 13, or it can optionally have a pointed edge 40, as illustrated in FIGURE 14 or even a rounded edge (not shown). A structural support bar 42 is positioned opposite the separating bar 36 for support of the cleaner 20 and to provide a frame for attachment of optional path rollers 26, rollers 28 and rotating equipment which is comprised of electric motors and drives, which are not shown, as they are well known in the art and in common usage today.<br>
To cover and provide an area for accumulation of the debris laden air, a plenum 44 encloses each roller 28 and separating bar 36 for collecting debris removed from the web surface by air currents formed by rotation of the rollers creating turbulence air on the web surface. The plenum 44 is shown by itself in FIGURES 12-15, and in its relationship with the other elements in FIGURES 1, 2, 7 and 19-11. The plenum 44 is preferably drawn from sheet metal stock, or through a die to obtain a consistent cross-sectional shape. The appropriate roller 28 produces turbulent air within the plenum 44 and provides a collecting area for the debris within the air.<br>
Each plenum 44 contains at least one rectangular opening 46 mat are adjacent to a distal end of the separating bar 36, thereby permitting air to flow into the ulterior of the plenum 44, as shown in FIGURES 13 and 14. While a number of openings 46 are illustrated it is preferred that one long slotted opening is used. The air flow path taken from the periphery of the roller 28 through the plenum 44 is shown in FIGURE 7. Each<br>
plenum 44 contains an outlet opening 48 on its top, center or end for passing the air from the plenum 44.<br>
The debris released from the web 22 is pushed back towards a slot between the support bar 42 and the separating bar 36 wInch by itself enables most of the debris to be removed, however some small lighter particles may still be in orbit. Therefore a dust collecting or a similar system is in order. When negative pressure is applied by a dust collector or similar system the airflow creates the Bernoulli effect through the slot between the support bar 42 and the air separating bar 36 wInch by accelerating the airflow generates a low pressure zone wInch strips the debris, wInch is still In orbit, and directs it away from the rotating rollers 28.<br>
In order to completely remove all of the debris and dispose of the debris from the plenum 44, means for storing debris in the form of a dust collector 50 or similar system is connected to each plenum 44, wInch ultimately accumulates all of the debris dislodged from the web surface. The connection from the plenum 44 to the dust collector 50 is provided by a hose 52 as shown in FIGURE 3. It will be noted that the dust collector 50 and hoses 52 are conventional and well known and other similar components may easily replace there utility.<br>
The actual arrangement of elements are normally subject to change due to the configuration of each different printing press and the space available. The drawings depict only a conceptual arrangement, mostly in outline schematic form, as the principles remain the same regardless of their orientation with each other.<br>
WInle the invention has been described in complete detail and pictorially shown in the accompanying drawings, it is not to be limited to such details, since many changes and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Hence, it is described to cover any and all modifications and forms wInch may come witInn the language and scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
