INTERNAL MOLD RELEASE AGENT FOR PRODUCTION OF POLYTHIOURETHANE OPTICAL MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an internal mold release agent for the production of polythiourethane optical materials, a process for producing the internal mold release agent, a composition for a polythiourethane optical material using the internal mold release agent and a process for producing the composition.  The polythiourethane optical material obtained by using the internal mold release agent of the present invention is suitably used as a plastic lens, particularly a plastic lens material for spectacles.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Transparent resins have been used for various kinds of optical materials using transparency equivalent to that of a mineral glass and impact property higher than that of a mineral glass. When one of transparent resins, a polythiourethane resin, is molded by casting polymerization and thus produced, a product cannot be obtained unless a resin is released from a mold. As known from the fact that a urethane resin is also used as an adhesive, the polythiourethane resin has been known as a resin having very strong<br><br>
adhesion so that it is essential to use a moid release agent for releasing the resin from the mold.<br>
[0003]<br>
Examples of the mold release agent include an external mold release agent for coating a mold surface using a spray or the like and an internal mold release agent to be added to a raw material monomer in advance. There are problems in the external mold release agent such that its operation is not only troublesome, but also it is difficult to form a homogeneous release film and the surface precision is lowered. So, the internal mold release agent is preferably used.<br>
Examples of the compound known as an internal mold release agent in the past include aliphatic alcohols, fatty acid esters, triglycerides, fluorine type surface active agents, higher fatty acid metal salts and the like. However, when these compounds were used, there have been defects such that it was difficult to be released, the surface or inside of the resin easily became turbid, and transparency of a resin by nature was easily deteriorated.  In the field of optical materials including typical examples of plastic lenses requiring very high transparency, such deteriorated transparency becomes a very critical defect.  Herein, as a means to solve the problem, various proposals have been made. For example, an internal mold release agent of an acidic phosphate ester compound and the like as described in Patent Documents 1 to 6 can be cited.  In Patent Documents 1 to 3, there has been described that, as an additive other than an internal mold release agent, an organic tin compound such as dibutyltin dichloride andthe like<br><br>
is necessarily added as a polymerization caralyst or a polymerization initiator.<br>
[0004]<br>
By the way, as a catalyst used in the production reaction of a polythiourethane resin, organic tin type catalysts including typical examples of DBC (dibutyltin dichloride) and DBTDL (dibutyltin dilaurate) have been widely used from the past in view of the fact that the catalytic activity is high. However, problems have, in late years, been pointed ou*:- in these organic tin type catalysts from the viewpoints of toxicity and safety.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, tributyltin contained in DBTDL as impurities has a problem of the risk of injury to the human body as an environmental hormone. Furthermore, there has already been a movement to control the use of organic tin compounds in Europe taking the lead in this movement.  Therefore, in the business world of spectacle lenses using polythiourethane resins, it has been urgently desired to develop a tin substituted catalyst. From now on, not only in Europe but also throughout the world, it is highly possible that the regulation on the use of organic tin catalysts is still more strengthened, while, in the polyurethane market, it becomes essential to develop a catalyst with high safety and high activity which can be a substitute of an organic tin catalyst.<br>
[0006]<br>
To produce a polythiourethane resin as a material for plastic lenses, a casting polymerization method in which a polymerizable composition is generally injected into a mold for heat curing can<br><br>
be taken, whereas the polymerization reaction is carried out while gradually raising the temperature from low temperature to high temperature over several hours to several tens of hours.  At that time, in order to obtain an optically homogeneous plastic lens, adding a catalyst is required to slowly carry out the polythiourethanization reaction controlled by heat lest thermal inhomogeneity be occurred while raising the temperature. Furthermore, in order to achieve full resin properties including optical properties, heat resistance and strength, it is necessary to complete the polymerization.  In order to complete the polymerization, a method in which a catalyst with strong polymerization activity is used or an amount of the catalyst is increased can be cited. However, such a method has a problem such that the polymerization reaction has all been progressed while the prepared polymerizable composition is injected into a mold, that is, a sufficient pot life cannot be secured.  Further, there is also a problem such that during the polymerization, exothermic heat is locally generated so that optical inhomogeneity is easily exhibited to lenses.<br>

Furthermore, the catalytic activity of such an internal mold release agent is a catalytic activity equal to or higher than that of a conventional organic tin type compound which might be harmful, and the present invention is to provide an internal mold release agent which is tin free and has a polymerization catalytic activity equal to or higher than that of a conventional compound.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0012]<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in detail below.<br>
The present invention relates to an internal mold release agent for the production of polythiourethane optical materials obtained by mixing an acidic phosphate ester compound and at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Zn, Cu, Fe, Ga, Bi, Al and<br><br>
Zr, wherein said metal is mixed in an amount of 0.01 to 20 weight % in the internal mold release agent.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to the aforementioned internal mold release agent for the production of polythiourethane optical materials, wherein the acidic phosphate ester compound is represented by the following general formula (1):<br>
[00131<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 [0014]<br>
wherein, in the formula, m represents 1 or 2; n represents an integer of 0 to 20; R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkylphenyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms or a phenylalkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms; and R2 and R3 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or an ethyl group.<br>
[0015]<br>

[0016]<br>
These metals are mixed in an amount of 0.01 to 20 weight % based on the total weight of the internal mold release agent. When the amount of metals to be mixed is excessively high, a sufficient pot<br><br>
life cannot be secured from the viewpoint: of polymerization rate or the obtained resin is possibly subjected to optical distortion. When the amount is excessively small, sufficient catalytic activity is not possibly obtained. The amount of metals to be mixed is more preferably from 0.31% to 10 weight i   based on the total weight of the internal mold release agent;.  In such a range, a further sufficient pot life can be secured and resins that are also optically homogeneous can be obtained. To be described later, the internal mold release agent of the oresent invention is added preferably in the range of 100 to 10,000 ppm based on the total amount of isocyanates and the active hydrogen compounds. Further, in order to achieve sufficient catalytic activity while securing sufficient amount of metals, and in order to secure a more sufficient pot life, the amount of metals is further preferably from 0.1% to 5 weight % based on the total weight of the internal mold release agent.  However, the amount of metals to be mixed can be suitably determined depending on the combination of monomers in use, the type of metals, the type of additives, amount and shape of molded products, and the molecular weight of an acidic phosphate ester compound.<br>

In the production of the polythiourethane optical material of the present, invention, the ratio of isocyanates and the active hydrogen compounds used as raw materials including the hydroxyl compounds used as modifier, may be such that the functional group molar ratio, (NCO+NCS)/(SH+OH), is usually in the range of 0.5 to 3.0, preferably in the range of 0.6 to 2.0 and further preferably in the range of 0.8 to 1.2.<br>
[0039]<br>
For the production of the polythiourethane optical material of the present invention, a variety of substances such as a chain extender, a cross-linking agent, a light stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, an anti-oxidant, an anti-coloring agent, an oil-soluble dye, filler, an adhesion improving agent or the like may be added, depending on the purpose, as in the known molding methods.<br>
[0040]<br>
The internal mold release agent of the present invention is obtained by adding acidic phosphate ester as much as the amount<br><br>
added thereof into a polymerization composition.  So, when the amount added is excessively high, lenses might be easily clouded. On the other hand, when the amount added is small, a resin becomes difficult to be released from a mold.  The .internal mold release agent of the present invention is preferably added in an amount range of 100 to 10,000 ppm based on the iotal amount of the isocyanates and the active hydrogen compound.  However, by taking the content of metal in the internal mo.id release agent, other polymerization conditions and the i she into consideration, even when the amount of the interna; mo., d reiease agent added exceeds 10,000 ppm, polymerization can be conducted without causing white turbidity of the lens with no problem.  Furthermore, even when the amount is less than 100 ppm, the r-sin can be released from the mold without any problem.  So, the range of the internal mold release agent of the present invention to be added is not definitely from 100 ppm to 10,000 ppm.<br>
[0041]<br>
In the present invention, when isocyanates and the active hydrogen compounds are mixed with an internal mold release agent composition and other additives before polymerization to produce a polymerization composition, the procedure of the internal mold release agent composition of the present invention and other additives to be added is different depending on the solubility into a monomer.  However, the internal mold release agent composition and other additives may be previously added to isocyanates and dissolved therein, added to the active hydrogen compounds and dissolved therein, or added to a mixture of the isocyanates and<br><br>
the active hydrogen compounds and dissolved therein. Ailtanatively, they may be dissolved in a part of the monomer in order to prepare a master solution, and then the solution may be added.  The procedure of addition is not restricted to chese exemplified methods, and properly selected depending on the operability, safety, expediency or the like.  Preferably, the interna], moid release agent composition of the present invention and other additives are previously added to isocyanates and dissolved therein, or dissolved in a part of isocyanates to prepare a master solution and then the solution is added.<br>
|. 0 0 4 2 J<br>
When the isocyanates and the active hydrogen compounds are mixed with the ..internal mold release agent and other additives to produce a polymerization composition, the temperature at that time is preferably not more than 25 degree centigrade from the viewpoint of the pot life of the composition. However, when the solubility of the internal mold release agent of the present invention and other additives into the monomer is not good, the internal mold release agent and other additives can be previously heated and dissolved in the monomer isocyanates or active hydrogen compounds, or in a monomer mixture.<br>
[0043]<br>
As a typical polymerization method for obtaining the polythiourethane resin (for example, plastic lens) from the thus obtained polymerization composition, casting polymerization can be cited. Namely, the polymerization composition according to the present invention is injected between molds held by a gasket, tapes<br><br>
or the like.
