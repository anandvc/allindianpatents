				<td>5"Phenylpyriniidines, their preparation, intermediates for their preparation, and their use for controlling harmful fungi<br>
The present invention relates to 5-phenylpyrimidines oi the formula I, <br>
in which the substituents have the following meanings:<br>
R4      is a five- to ten-membered saturated, partially<br>
unsaturated or aromatic mono- or bicyclic heterocycle comprising one to four hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of 0, N or S, except for pyridyl, it being possible for R4 to be substituted by one to three identical or different groups R4,<br>

R3 and R4 may also, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, form a five- or six-membered ring which can be interrupted by a hetero atom selected from the group consisting of 0, N and S and/or which can have<br><br>
attached to it one or more substituents selected trom tne group consisting of halogen, C1-C6-alkyl, Ci-C^-^i^iloalkyl and oxy-Ci-C3-alkylenoxy or in which two adjacent c atoms or one N atom and one adjacent C atom can be linked by a Cx-C4-alkylene chain;<br>

Moreover, the invention relates to processes and intermediates for the preparation of these compounds and to their use for controlling harmful fungi,<br>
Fungicidally active 2-pyridyl-4-amino pyridine derivatives are disclosed in EP-A 407 899, pyridylpyrimidine derivatives are disclosed in DE-A 39 37 284, DE-A 39 37 285, DE^A 40 29 649, DE-A 40 34 762, DE-A 42 27 811, EP-A 481 405 and WO-A 92/10490.<br>
The compounds described in the abovementioned publications are suitable as crop protection agents against harmful fungi.<br>
In many cases, however, their action is not satisfactory, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds with an improved activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the phenylpyrimidine derivatives I defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found processes and intermediates for their preparation and compositions comprising them for controlling harmful fungi, and their use.<br>
The compounds of the formula I have an improved activity against harmful fungi compared with the known compounds.<br>
The compounds I can be obtained via various routes.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is heterocycles bonded via nitrogen and R2 is chlorine can be prepared, for example, by the following process:<br><br>
The cyclocondensation of thiourea with alkyl phenylmaloIl^ites of the formula II gives compounds of the formula III<br><br>
where, in formula II, R is Cx-Ce-alkyl. The reaction is usually<br>
carried out in a protic solvent such as, for example, alcohols,<br>
in particular ethanol. However, it may also be carried out in<br>
aprotic solvents such as, for example, pyridine,<br>
N,N-dimethyIformcimide, N,N-dimethylacetaimide, or mixtures of<br>
these [cf- US 4,331,590; Org. Prep, and Proced. Int., Vol. 10,<br>
pp. 21-27 (1978); Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., Vol. 48,<br>
pp. 137-143 (1983); Heteroat. Chem., Vol. 10, pp. 17-23 (1999);<br>
Czech. Chem. Commun., Vol. 58, pp. 2215-2221 (1993).<br>
It may be advantageous to carry out the process in the presence of a base, which may be employed in equimolar amounts or else in excess. Examples of suitable bases are alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogen carbonates and alkaline earth metal hydrogen carbonates, for example the potassium and sodium salts, in particular Na2C03 and NaHCOs, or else nitrogen bases such as, for example, pyridine and tributylamine. The reaction temperature is normally 2 0-250OC, preferably 70-220OC.<br>
The reactants are usually employed in an approximately<br>
stoichiometric ratio. However, it may be advantageous to employ<br>
thiourea in excess. The arylmalonates required are known<br>
(cf. EP-A 1002 788) or can be prepared by methods known from the<br>
literature.<br>
Compounds III were reacted by means of alkylating agents IV to give the thiobarbituric acid derivatives. In formula iv, R is C1-C6-alkyl and X is a leaving group which can be eliminated nucleophilically. Formula IV generally represents customary alkylating agents such as C1-C6-alkyl halides, in particular methyl chloride and methyl bromide, di(Ci-C6-alkyl) sulfates, such as dimethyl sulfate, or a C1-C6-alkyl methanesulfonate, such as methyl methanesulfonate.<br><br><br>
The reaction can be carried out in water or else in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as, for example, N,N-diinethylformamide [cf. US 5,250,689], it is advantageously carried out in the presence of a base, which may be employed in equimolar amounts or else in excess. Suitable bases are alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal hydrogen carbonates and alkaline earth metal hydrogen carbonates, such as, for example, KOH, NaOH, NaHCOs and Na2C03, but also nitrogen bases such as pyridine. The reaction temperature is usually 0-100Â°C, preferably 10-60Â°C. The reactants are usually employed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio. However, it may be advantageous to employ the alkylating agent in excess.<br>
Compounds V are converted into dichloropyrimidines of the formula VI [cf. US 4,963,678; EP-A 745 593; DE-A 196 42 533; WO-A 99/32458; J.Org. Chem. Vol. 58, (1993), pp. 3785-3786; Helv. Chim. Acta, Vol. 64, (1981), pp. 113-152].<br>
/<br><br>
Examples of suitable chlorinating agents [Cl] are POCI3, PCI3/CI2 or PCI5, or mixtures of these. The reaction can be carrxed out in an excess of chlorinating agent (POCI3) or an inert solvent such as, for example, acetonitrile or 1,2-dichloroethane. Carrying out the reaction in POCI3 is preferred.<br>
This reaction is usually carried out at between 10 and IBOOC. For practical reasons, the reaction temperature usually corresponds to the boiling point of the chlorinating agent employed (POCI3) or of the solvent employed. The process is advantageously carried out with addition of N,N-dimethylformamide in catalytic or substoichiometric amounts or with addition of nitrogen bases such as, for example, N,N-dimethylaniline.<br>
By amination with VII, the dichloro compounds of the formula VI are converted into the compounds of the formula VIII.<br><br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at from 0 to 150*^0, preferably at from 20 to 120^0 [cf. J. Chem. Res. S (7), (1995), pp. 286-287, Liebigs Ann. Chem., (1995), pp. 1703-1705] in an inert solvent, if appropriate in the presence of an auxiliary base.<br>
Suitable solvents are protic solvents, such as alcohols, for example ethanol, or aprotic solvents, such as aromatic hydrocarbons or ethers, for example toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, in particular tert-butyl methyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. Exeimples of suitable auxiliary bases are the following: NaHCOa, Na2C03, Na2HP04, Na2B407, diethylanilme or ethyldiisopropylamine.<br>
The reactants are normally employed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio. However, it may be advantageous to employ the amine in excess-<br>
The amines of the formula VII are commercially available or known from the literature or can be prepared by known methods.<br>
The thio compounds VIII are oxidized to give the sulfones of the formula IX-<br><br>
The reaction is usually carried out at from 0 to lOO^C, preferably at from 10 to SO^C, in the presence of protic or aprotic solvents [cf.: B. Kor. Chem. Soc, Vol. 16, (1995), pp. 489-492; Z. Chem., Vol. 17, (1977), p. 63].<br>
Suitable solvents are alkylcarboxylic acids such as acetic acid or alcohols such as methanol, water or halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane or chloroform. Mixtures of these may also<br><br>
be employed. Preferred are acetic acid and a methanol/waiter | mixture.<br>
Examples of suitable oxidants are hydrogen peroxide,  pertungstic acid, peracetic acid, 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, perphthalic acid, chlorine, oxygen and OxoneÂ® (KHSO5). The oxidant is usually employed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio. However, it may be advantageous to carry out the process with an excess of oxidant.<br>
Pyrimidine derivatives of the formula IX are converted into the compounds I by reaction with heterocycles of the formula X, In formula X, the cycle A is a five- to ten-membered saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic nitrogen-containing ring.<br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at from 0 to 200^0, preferably at from 10 to 15Q^C,   in the presence of a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile [cf. DE-A 39 01 084; Chimia, Vol. 50, (1996), pp. 525-530; Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin, Vol. 12, (1998), pp. 1696-1697].<br>
The reactants are usually employed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio. However, it may be advantageous to employ the nitrogen heterocycle of the formula X in excess.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a base, which may be employed in equimolar amounts or else in excess. Suitable bases are alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal halogen carbonates, for example Na2C03 and NaHCOa, nitrogen bases such as triethylamine, tributylamine and pyridine, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, alkali metal amides such as NaNH2, or else alkali metal hydrides such as LiH or NaH.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is bonded to the pyrimidine ring via a carbon atom can be synthesized for example as follows:<br><br><br>
In formulae Vb and XII, the cycle B is a five- to ten-membered saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic heterocycle ring which is bonded via carbon.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out at from 50 to 250^0, preferably at from 100 to 200^0 in the presence of a inert solvent [cf.: Austr. J. Chem., Vol. 32, (1979), pp. 669-679; J. Org. Chem., Vol. 58, (1993), pp. 3785-3786; Arm. Xim. ZH, Vol. 38, Nil, (1985), 718-719].<br>
The following are suitable as solvents: protic solvents such as alcohols, preferably methanol or ethanol, or aprotic solvents such as tributylamine or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether.<br>
As a rule, it is advantageous to carry out the process in the presence of a base, which can be employed in equimolar amounts or else in excess. Suitable bases are alkali metal alkoxides and alkaline earth metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, in particular sodium methoxide, or else nitrogen bases such as triethylamine, triisopropylethylamine and N-methylpiperidine, in particular pyridine and tributylcimine.<br>
Usually, the reactants are employed in approximately stoichiometric cunounts. However, it may also be advantageous to employ one of the reactants in excess.<br><br><br>
The amination of the dichloropyrimidine VIb with VII is carried out under the same conditions as the amination of VI to give<br>
VIII.<br>
Compounds of the formula VI in which R4 is alkoxy are obtained from the corresponding chloro compounds of the formula vi (R2 = CI) by reaction with alkali metal alkoxides or alkaline earth metal alkoxides [cf.: Heterocycles, Vol. 32, (1991), pp. 1327-1340; J. Heterocycl. Chem. Vol. 19, (1982), pp. 1565-1567; Geterotsikl. Soedin, (1991) pp. 400-402].<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is cyano are obtained from the corresponding chloro compounds of the formula VI (R4 ^ CI) by reaction with alkali metal cyanides, alkaline earth metal cyanides or metal cyanides, such as NaCN, KCN or Zn(CN)2, [cf.: Heterocycles, Vol. 39, (1994), pp. 345-356; Collect. Czech, Chem. Commun. Vol. 60, (1995), pp. 1386-1389; Acta Chim. Scand., Vol. 50, (1996), pp. 58-63].<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is hydrogen are obtained from the corresponding chloro compounds of the formula vi (R2 = CI) by catalytic hydrogenation [cf.: J. Fluorine Chem. Vol. 45, (1989), pp. 417-430; J. Heterocycl. Chem. Vol. 29, (1992), pp. 1369-1370], or by reduction with zinc in acetic acid [cf.: Org. Prep. Proced. Int., Vol. 27, (1995), pp. 600-602; JP-A 09/165 379].<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is C1-C6-alkyl or C1-C6-haloalkyl can be prepared in analogy to the above-described synthesis sequence to give the compounds I in which R4 is chlorine by suitably altering the starting materials of the formula II. Instead of the phenylmalonates of the formula II, phenyl-P-ketoesters of the formula XIII in which R2 is alkyl are reacted with thiourea or the amidine of the formula xii. The reactions which follow are carried out analogously to the compounds where R4 = chlorine.<br><br><br><br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in the customary fashion, for excimple by mixing with water, separating the phases and, if appropriate, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the intermediates and end products are obtained m the form of colorless or pale brown viscous oils, which are freed or purified from volatile constituents under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperature. If the intermediates and end products are obtained as solids, they may also be purified by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
If individual compounds I cannot be obtained via the above-described routes, they can be prepared by derivatizing other compounds I.<br>

The lipophilicity parameters logPow (Table I) were determined as specified by OECD directive test guidelines using the RP-HPLC run time method.<br>
To this end, a logk'/logPow correlation curve based on ten reference substances was plotted and validated with the aid of the lipophilicity parameters of eight comparative substances, which had been established by the extraction method.<br>
A commercially available reversed-phase Cie stationary phase was used as stationary phase. Chromatographic separation was carried out with methanol and a buffer solution as mobile phase at pH 7.4 under isocratic conditions.<br>
The retention times of the standards tR were converted in accordance with equation O into the capacity factors k', where to, as reaction time of the solvent unretarded on the reversed-phase Cig stationary phase, represents the dead time of the chromatographic system:<br><br>
The linear correlation of the logk' values with the logPow values of the standards published in the appendix to the Directive 92/69/EEC yields the correlation curve through linear regression.<br>
The lipophilicity parameters logPow of  the analytes were interpolated from the correlation curve of the standards after calculation of the logarithmic capacity logk'.<br>
The validation of the RP-HPLC analytical method described, and of the standards used, is carried out with the aid of eight comparison active compounds, the distribution behavior of which was determined with the aid of the extraction method.<br>
Examples for the action against harmful fungi<br>
