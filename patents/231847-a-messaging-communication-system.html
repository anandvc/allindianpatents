Description of the Related Art<br>
With the proliferation of the Internet, the way people communicate changing. Electronic communication such as electronic mail (email), and real time electronic messaging (e g. instant messaging and chat messaging) is quickly replacing traditional telephonic communication and handwritten letters. Real time electronic messaging allows the simultaneous access to a message or a plurality of messages by multiple account users, with each account user capable of inputting a message or a plurality of messages to a messaging session. Each inputted message is relayed to messaging clients operating on messaging devices (such as computers) of the other account users who have chosen to participate in that messaging session The other session participants can respond with their own messages, which are likewise relayed to all the participating devices. These messages are typically text messages that are delivered to the intended recipients) of the message in a real time manner. However, these messages may be in a variety of different media formats or combinations thereof such as audio, animation, video, images, etc  A session history of the messages received and transmitted by all participants involved in the messaging session is typically maintained on the individual participants' devices and typically presented on the screen of the respective device in the form of a scrolling dialog. This text history constitutes one of the attributes of the look and feel of the real time electronic messaging experience.<br>
There are currently several standard methods available for account users to participate in messaging communications. For example, personal instant messaging typically occurs between two individuals. An individual can establish a private chat room so that multiple users can participate in a common on-line conversation Participants gain access to the private chat room by accepting an invitation from the creator of the private chat room   Non-restricted public chat rooms are available to anyone interested in the topic being discussed by simply selecting the desired chat room descriptor on the account user a device. In addition to the non-restricted public chat rooms there are limited access public chat rooms. An example of one such restriction is the limiting of the number of account users allowed to participate in the chat room.  Electronic gaming is available to participants who register and login to join at least one other participant in playing one or more games Communication of participants' "moves" are made through electronic message communications in messaging sessions.<br>
Each messaging session can have various types of session attributes such as session type, session connection info, participants, filter settings, colors, relative font sizes, etc. The account user can also have various types of preferences such as colors, relative font sizes, buddy lists, nicknames, and parental control settings.. These are only a few examples of the attributes and preferences that can effect a messaging session.<br>
Several different devices, such as personal computers, interactive broadcast receivers and mobile communication devices, can be utilized to participate in messaging communications. Although these different devices can be utilized to participate in a messaging communication they all do not have the same set of features and capabilities. For example, display size, support for different media types, and cost of sending messages can all be different for different devices. Some messaging service providers maintain the same user preference settings such as screen names, buddy list groups, electronic mailboxes, and parental control settings regardless of which device is used to access the service  By having this capability the service providers are providing continuity of user preferences from device to device, which simplifies the use of multiple devices in the messaging system<br>
In order to utilize real time electronic messaging, a device is pre-conngured with, or the user installs, application client software distributed by a particular<br>
service provider. The client software connects to a message server for communication   To access the message server, via a logon procedure, the client sends the routing information (e g. IP address and number of the port assigned to the client, mobile phone number) of the device being used, the account user's username, the account user's password, and the account user's current availability setting to the message server. The message server temporarily stores the routing and availability information for the account user's device  In response to the account user's login information (username and password), the message server provides the messaging client with the account user's contact list  The message server then determines the presence and availability of the account users in that contact list  If the message server finds any of the contacts logged in (1 e. presence setting is online), it sends a message back to the messaging client on the account user's device with the presence and availability information for that account user The message server also sends the account user's presence and availability information to the people that have the account user in their contact list  The account user can click on the name of a person in his/her contact list who is online, and a window is created in which the account user can enter a message The account user enters a message and clicks "send" to communicate with that person The other person gets the message and can respond Messages between account users may be addressed directly to the account user's device or may be addressed to the username<br>
The window that the session participants see on their respective messaging devices typically includes a scrolling dialog of the session history. Each participant's messages appear in this window on all participating devices. Messages can have different attributes such as message formatting, sender identification, timestamps and others. For example, messages related to a particular electronic game could contain graphics enhancing the "look and feel" of the electronic game for the participants.<br>
When the messaging session is complete, the account users close the message window for that messaging session  When the account user signs off, his/her messaging client sends a message to the message server to terminate the account user's participation in the plurality of messaging sessions   The message server then sends an update of the account user's presence and availability<br>
information to the people that have the account user in their contact list to indicate the account user has signed off. Finally, the message server discards the routing and availability information for the account user's device.<br>
Some messaging services support access of a single account from multiple devices  Further, some messaging services also support simultaneous login of devices on the same account  Still further, some messaging services utilize a resource extension to describe the device that is being utilized to communicate. For example an account user logging in with a mobile device can choose to use "mobile-device" as their resource extension while logging into the same account from the home personal computer may utilize a resource extension of "home computer"<br>
When using messaging services that allow access from multiple devices, an account user can log on with a first messaging device and engage in conversations with other account users and later log on with a second messaging device For example, users of mobile devices would typically benefit if a messaging session in progress on a fixed network device could be continued on a mobile device. This would allow the account user to continue the messaging session when the account user is no longer in proximity to the fixed network device. In addition the account user would benefit if a messaging session that was in progress on a mobile device could be continued on a fixed network device that may have a superior user<br>
In order to switch to a different device with existing technology, the account user may have to cause the currently connected device to disconnect from the message server The account user would then have to cause the second device to connect to the message server and login Finally, the account user would have to reinitiate each messaging session (one-to-one, public chat, private chat, electronic game) that was in progress on the first device The disadvantage of this method is the numerous manual operations required of the account user to change devices  A further disadvantage is the lack of messaging session continuity. For example, the second device will not have the session history that was available on the first device, and the second device may not be able to re-connect to chat rooms that restrict the number of active account users since another account user may have connected to the chat room after the account user's first device disconnected<br>
What is needed is a system and method for maintaining continuity between messaging clients<br>

FIG 12 is an electronic block diagram illustrating an alternative embodiment of the messaging communication system 10,170 in accordance with the present invention  As illustrated, the messaging communication system 10,170 preferably includes a first messaging system 288 having a first plurality of messaging clients 292, and a second messaging system 290 having a second plurality of messaging clients 294  In one embodiment, the messaging communication system 10,170 also includes the message server 172  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that while only two messaging systems are shown by way of example, multiple messaging systems can be interconnected in a manner well known to one of ordinary skill in the art for the transfer of electronic communication such as electronic mail (email), and real time electronic messaging (i e  instant messaging<br><br>
and chat messaging) either directly between the messaging systems and/or by using the messaging server 172.<br>
It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that, in accordance with the present invention, the first messaging system 288 and the second messaging system 290 can be the wireless messaging system 114 of FIG 9, the wired messaging system 89 of FIG. 10, the broadcast messaging system 274 of FIG 11 or any other equivalent messaging system.  Further, in accordance with the present invention, the messaging communication system 10,170 can include a plurality of wireless messaging systems, a plurality of wired messaging systems, or any combination thereof   Similarly, each messaging client of the first plurality of messaging clients 292 and the second plurality of messaging clients 294 can operate within the mobile device 90 of FIG. 6, the fixed network device 50 of FIG S, or the cable box 136 of FIG 7. The first plurality of messaging clients 292 and the second plurality of messaging clients 294, in accordance with the present invention, can include a plurality of wireless messaging devices, a plurality of wired messaging devices, a plurality of networked devices, or any combination thereof.<br>
FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the messaging communication system 10,170 in accordance with the present invention. Beginning with Step 296. the first messaging client 14 establishes the first communication connection 16 for communication within at least one of the plurality of messaging sessions 24 within the messaging communication system 10,170 For example, when the first messaging client 14 operates within the fixed network device 50, the first messaging client 14 accesses the appropriate network and notifies the messaging communication system 10,170 of its connection information (i.e. IP address and number of the port assigned to the first messaging client 14)  Next, in Step 298, the process determines whether or not an authentication is required  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that an authentication can be required of the first messaging client 14, of the first account user 29 utilizing the first messaging client 14, or of the messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates, or an equivalent.  In Step 300, when an authentication is required in Step 298, a first authentication is performed   The first authentication of Step 300 checks that the first account user 29 or alternatively the first messaging client 14 is authorized to establish the first communication connection 16 and/orauthorized to participate within one or more of the plurality of messaging sessions 24.  Next, in Step 302, when the first authentication of Step 300 is completed, and also when the authentication is not required in Step 298, the first messaging client 14 operates using the first communication connection 16 and accumulates the plurality of session data 36 for each messaging session 40 for which the first messaging client 14 is participating. In accordance with the present invention, the plurality of session data 36 can include the session identifier 41, the session priority 42, the session preferences 43, the sesson participants 44, or the session history 45. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the plurality of session data 36 can include any of the items mentioned herein or an equivalent. Next, in Step 304. the process determines whether a data transfer is required or requested  A data transfer, in accordance with the present invention, is the capability for a first account user 29 to change communication means within the messaging communication system 10,170 from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20  For example, when the first account user 29 establishes the first communication connection 16 using the fixed network device 50 and thereafter needs to become mobile, the first account user 29 can transfer the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 accumulated for the first communication connection 16 to the second messaging client 20 which for example can operate on the mobile device 90  When no data transfer is required or requested in Step 304, the first communication connection 16 is maintained in Step 302, whereby the first messaging client 14 continues to accumulate the plurality of session data 36 for each messaging session 40 for which the first messaging client 14 participates.  In Step 306, when a data transfer is required or requested in Step 304, the process determines if it is necessary to verify the second messaging client 20 prior to transferring the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 to the second messaging client 20  When verification of the second messaging client 20 is required, the second messaging client 20 is verified in step 308  For example, the first messaging client 14 and the second messaging client 20 can both be pre-configured with a private value and the first messaging client 14 can exchange messages with the second messaging client 20 that verify that the second messaging client 20 has the correct private value. Next, in Step 310, after the second messaging client 20 is verified in Step 308 or when no verification is required in<br>
Step 306, the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that a portion of the first client data 17 can alternatively be transferred in Step 310. It will further be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the transfer of the first client data 17 can be accomplished using a direct connection between the first messaging client 14 and the second messaging client 20 or a connection through the message server 172, both either via a network connection. ,i wireless connection such as through the wireless communication system 114, a Bluetooth connection, or IRDA connection, a wired connection such as through the wired communication system 89, a network connection separate from the wireless communication system, an RS-232 connection or the broadcast messaging system 274, or an equivalent<br>
Next, m Step 312, the process determines whether or not the second communication connection 22 has already been established. For example, the second messaging client 20 can establish the second communication connection 22 independently from the establishment of the first communication connection 16 by the first messaging client 14. The second messaging client 20 can establish the second communication connection 22 but not yet be participating in a messaging session. Alternatively, the second messaging client 20 can independently be participating in one or more messaging session of the plurality of messaging session 24 which can be the same or different messaging sessions from the ones that the first messaging client 14 is participating. In Step 314, when no second communication connection 22 has been established for the second messaging client 20, the process determines whether or not the authentication key 33 is required  In Step 316, when the authentication key 33 is required in Step 314, the first messaging client 14 transfers the authentication key 33 to the second messaging client 20. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the second messaging client 20 can include a plurality of authentication keys and that in step 316 the first messaging client 14 can send an indicator of which of the plurality of authentication keys should be used.  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that an authentication key can be required of the second messaging client 20, of the first account user 29, or any other account user 30 utilizing the second messaging client 20, or of the particular messaging device in which the secondmessaging client 20 operates, or an equivalent. It will further be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the transfer of the authentication key 33 can be accomplished using a direct connection between the first messaging client 14 and the second messaging client 20 or a connection through the message server 172, both either via a network connection, a wireless connection such as through the wireless communication system 114, a Bluetooth connection, or IRDA connection, a wired connection such as through the wired communication system 89. a network connection separate from the wireless communication system , an RS-232 connection or the broadcast messaging system 274, or an equivalent.     Next, in Step 318, when no authentication key is required in Step 314 or after the transfer of the authentication key in Step 316, the second communication connection 22 is established. The second messaging client 20 establishes the second communication connection 22 for communication within at least one of the plurality of messaging sessions 24 within the messaging communication system 10,170. For example, when the second messaging client 20 is the mobile device 90, the second messaging client 20 accesses the appropriate network through the wireless communication system 114 and notifies the messaging communication system 10,170 of its connection information (i e the second address 244 of the second mobile device 230 when the second messaging client 20 operates within the second mobile device 230). Next, in Step 320, the process determines whether or not an authentication is required. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that an authentication can be required of the second messaging client 20, of the first account user 29, or any other account user 30 utilizing the second messaging client 20, or of the particular messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates, or an equivalent.  In Step 322, when an authentication is required in Step 320, a second authentication is performed. Next, in Step 324, when the second communication connection 22 is already established in Step 312, or after the second session connection 22 is established in Step 318 and authentication is not required in Step 320, or after the second authentication in Step 322, the second communication connection 22 is operated using the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20 in Step 310<br>
The method illustrated by the flowchart of FIG. 13 allows messaging sessions to be easily transferred between messaging clients while maintaining session continuity and assuring session security The account user can switch to a different messaging client on a different messaging system without being required to re-mitiate each messaging session that was in progress on the first messaging client. Session continuity is maintained within the two messaging clients, and optionally the transfer does not affect other messaging session participants.<br>
Similarly, the method illustrated by the flowchart of FIG 13 allow s messaging sessions to be easily transferred between different account users. For example, if the first account user 29 is a customer service representative and the first account user 29 is a participant in the plurality of messaging sessions 24 with customers The first account user 29 may want to transfer a portion of the plurality of messaging sessions 24 to another account user 30 such as a second customer service representative. The second customer service representative would benefit from having access to the session history 45 of the transferred messaging sessions  For example, the second customer representative can avoid asking the customer for information already provided to the first account user 29.FIG. 14 is a flowchart illustrating more detail of the operation of the messaging communication system 10,170  Specifically, FIG. 14 illustrates various methods in which the data transfer query (Step 304 of FIG. 13) can be answered in the affirmative. The operation begins with Step 302, in which the first messaging client 14 operates using the first communication connection 16 and accumulates the plurality of session data 36 for each messaging session 40 for which the first messaging client 14 is participating. Next, in Step 326, the process determines whether or not the first messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates has received a user input requesting the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 For example, when the messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates is the fixed network device SO of FIG 5, the first account user 29 can enter and manipulate information (including requesting the transfer of the first client data 17) by the user input 88 to the user interface 64, e g , the keyboard 66, the "mouse," 68, the pen or puck activated tablet (not shown), the trackball 70, the audio activated command recognition processor 72, or the like Similarly, when the first messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates is the mobile device 90 of FIG 6, the first account user 29 can enter a user input such as a button press, a series of button presses, a voice response, or some other similar method of manual response initiated by the first account user 29 to the device user interface 110 of the mobile device 90.   Similarly, when the first messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates is the cable box 136 of FIG 7, the user input is made via the cable box user interface 160. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary stall in the art that the user input can be any of the inputs mentioned herein or an equivalent  When a user input requesting the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is not received by the first messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates, the process next, in Step 328 determines whether a user input requesting the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 has been received by a second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates. For example, when the second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates is the fixed network device 50 of FIG 5, the first account user 29 can enter and manipulate information (including requesting the transfer of the first client data 17) by the user input 88 to the user interface 64, e.g.. the keyboard 66, the "mouse," 68, the pen or puck activated tablet (not shown), the trackball 70, the audio activated command recognition processor 72, or the like. Similarly, when the second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates is the mobile device 90 of FIG. 6, the first account user 29 of the mobile device 90 can enter a user input such as a button press, a series of button presses, a voice response, or some other similar method of manual response initiated by the first account user 29 to the device user interface 110 of the mobile device 90.   Similarly, when the second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates is the cable box 136 of FIG 7, the user input is made via the cable box user interface 160  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the user input can be any of the inputs mentioned herein or an equivalent.  When a user input requesting the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is not received by the second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates, the process next, in Step 330 determines whether the second messaging client 20 is the mobile device 90, and if so, whether the transfer<br>
of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is initiated in response to detection of a movement of the mobile device 90. For example, the server processor 174 oi the message server 172 can be programmed to track the location of each of the plurality of messaging clients 12, and transfer the plurality of session data 36 to the second messaging client 20 in response to the detection of a change of location of the mobile device 90 in which the second messaging client 20 operates. Alternatively, the mobile device 90 can include location-sensing capabilities such as a Global Positioning Satellite receiver, and in response to the detection of a change of location, send a request to transfer the plurality of session data 36. Alternatively, the second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates can detect its removal from a charging base. Alternatively, the second messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates may have a motion-sensing device such as a bit sensor whose electrical properties change when under motion. When no device movement is detected or alternatively a device movement program is not included in either the mobile device 90 or the message server 172, in Step 330, the process continues to Step 331 in which it is determined whether or not the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is required due to the activation of the second messaging client 20. The activation of the second messaging client 20 can be, for example, in response to a user input to a power circuit that powers the second messaging client 20. Alternatively, the activation of the second messaging client 20 can be in response to an instruction command to activate sent from CPU 53 to the fixed messaging client 84 of the fixed network device 50, from the processor 102 to the mobile messaging client 112 of the mobile device 90, or from the controller 138 to the cable messaging client 40 of the cable box 136. In one embodiment of the present invention, the message server 172 is programmed to detect the activation of the second messaging client 20   In an alternate embodiment, the second messaging client 20 can request the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 upon being activated.  When the second messaging client 20 is not activated in Step 331, the process continues to Step 332 in which it is determined whether the second messaging client 20 has connected to the message server 172   When no connection of the second messaging client 20 is detected, the process returns to Step 326 and<br>
continues checking for the various methods in which the data transfer query (Step 304 of FIG 13) can be answered in the affirmative. In Step 333, when there is an affirmative answer to any of the previous Steps 326 to 332. the query of Step 304 ot FIG 13 of whether or not to transfer data is answered in the affirmative.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating more detail of the operation of the messaging communication system 10,170. Specifically, FIG 15 illustrates various ways in which the first messaging client 14 can operate in relation to the transfer of the plurality of the first client data 17. The operation begins, with Step 302. in which the first messaging client 14 operates using the first communication connection 16 and accumulates the plurality of session data 36 for each messaging session 40 for which the first messaging client 14 is participating. Next, m Step 334, the process determines whether it is required or requested to disconnect the first messaging client 14 from the first communication connection 16   When it is required or requested to disconnect the first messaging client 14 from the first communication connection 16, in Step 336 the first messaging client 14 is disconnected from the first communication connection 16  Next, in Step 310, when the first messaging client 14 is disconnected from the first communication connection 16 in Step 336 and when it is not desired to disconnect the first messaging client 14 from the first communication connection 16 in Step 334, at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20 Next, in Step 338, the process once again determines whether it is required or requested to disconnect the first messaging client 14 from the first communication connection 16   In Step 340, when it is required or requested to disconnect the first messaging client 14 from the first communication connection 16, the first messaging client 14 is disconnected from the first communication connection 16. When no disconnection of the first messaging client 14 is required or requested in Step 338, the process moves to Step 342 in which the first messaging client 14 continues the first communication connection 16 using the first client data 17 and accumulating the plurality of session data 36  Next, in Step 324, and also after disconnecting the first messaging client 14 in Step 340, the second messaging client 20 operates the second communication connection 22 using the transferred portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36<br>
The flowchart of FIG. IS as described herein provides an efficient and flexible method for disconnecting the first messaging client 14 from the first communication connection 16 prior to the transfer of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 or after the transfer of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36. Further, it provides a method for the continued operation of the first messaging client 14 on the first communication connection 16 and the second messaging client 20 on the second communication connection 22 using the same plurality of session data 36 included in at least a portion of the first client data 17.<br>
FIG. 16 is a flowchart illustrating more detail of the operation of the messaging communication system 10,170. Specifically, FIG 16 illustrates more detail of the transfer of the first client data 17 from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20 or alternatively a portion of the first client data 17 such as the client data portion 18 or alternatively the session portion 49  The operation begins with Step 302, in which the first messaging client 14 operates using the first communication connection 16 and accumulates the plurality of session data 36 for each messaging session 40 for which the first messaging client 14 is participating. While operating within the first communication connection 16, the first client data 17 of the first messaging client 14 includes both the client data such as the first client identifier 15 as well as an accumulation of the plurality of session data 36  Next, in Step 344, the process determines whether only a portion of the first client data 17 such as the client data portion 18 or the session portion 49 is being transferred In Step 346, when the enure first client data 17 is being transferred in Step 344, the first client data 17 is transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20. Thereafter, the second client data 23 of the second messaging client 20 includes the first client data 17 along with any other client data already included within the second client data 23  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the transfer of the first client data 17 can be accomplished using a direct connection between the first messaging client 14 and the second messaging client 20 or a connection through the message server 172 both either via a network connection, a wireless connection such as through the wireless communication system 114, a wired connection such as through the wired communication system 89 or the broadcast messaging system 274, or an equivalent <br>
Next, in Step 348, when a portion of the first client data 17 is bemg transferred, the process determines whether a client data requirement has been sent from the second messaging client 20 to the first messaging client 14. In Step 350, when a client data requirement has been sent from the second messaging client 20 to the first messaging client 14, the client data portion 18 is determined using the client data requirement   For example, due to memory limitations of the device in which the second messaging client 20 operates, the client data portion 18 can be a defined, limited portion of the session history 45. As another example, the client data requirement can be the plurality of user preferences 35 for the first messaging client 14 set by the first account user 29. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the client data requirement can be a requirement for all or any portion of the first client data 17 sent from the second messaging client 20. When no client data requirement has been received by the first messaging client 14 from the second messaging client 20, the process moves to Step 352 in which the process determines whether a predetermined client data portion 18 has been programmed either into the first messaging client 14 or alternatively into the message server 172. In Step 354, when me predetermined client data portion 18 has been programmed, the client data portion 18 is determined using the predetermined client data portion 18. In Step 356, when no predetermined portion has been defined in Step 352, some other method is used to identify the client data portion 18  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that any other method can be used to identify the client data portion 18 in accordance with the present invention. Next, in Step 358, when the client data portion 18 has been identified in Step 350, 354, or 356, the client data portion 18 is transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the transfer of the client data portion 18 can be accomplished using a direct connection between the first messaging client 14 and the second messaging client 20 or a connection through the message server 172, both either via a network connection, a wireless connection such as through the wireless communication system 114, a wired connection such as through the wired communication system 89 or the broadcast messaging system 274, or an equivalent<br>
The flowchart of FIG. 16 provides a method for limiting the amount of client data transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client<br>
20, optimizing the efficiency of the transfer of client data to maintain overall optimal system utilization.<br>
FIG 17 is a flowchart illustrating further operation of the messaging communication system 10,170 in which the first messaging client 14 participates in a plurality of messaging sessions 24. The operation begins with Step 359 in which the first messaging client establishes the first communication connection 16. Next, in Step 360. a counter is set to N=l. Next, in Step 362, the process determines whether the first messaging client 14 ts participating in an Nth messaging session In Step 364, when the first messaging client 14 is not participating in the Nth messaging session, the counter is incremented by one (1). Next, in Step 365, the process determines whether or not the Nth messaging session exists. When the Nth session does not exist, the process ends  When the Nth messaging session does exist, the process returns to Step 362 in which it is determined whether the first messaging client 14 is participating in the Nth messaging session. In Step 366, when the first messaging client 14 is participating in the Nth messaging session in Step 362, the Nth messaging session including its associated session data is included in the first communication connection 16   Next, in Step 368, it is determined whether the Nth messaging session is requested or required to be transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20 When the Nth messaging session is not requested or required to be transferred in Step 368, the process returns to Step 366 m which the first communication connection 16 continues to include the Nth messaging session. In Step 370, when, in Step 368, the Nth messaging session is being transferred, session data for the Nth messaging session is included in the plurality of session data 36 of the first client data 17. The session data included for the Nth messaging session can be, for example, the Nth session identifier 41, the Nth session priority 42, the Nth session preferences 43, the Nth session participants 44 and/or the Nth session history 45 Next, in Step 310, at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the session data for the Nth messaging session is transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that, in accordance with the present invention, the plurality of session data for each messaging session to be transferred can be transferred separately. Alternatively, in accordance with the present invention, the plurality of session data<br>
for all messaging sessions being transferred can be transferred at one time in one or more communications. Next, in Step 312, the process determines whether or not the second communication connection 22 has been established. In Step 318. when the second communication connection 22 has not been established, the second communication connection 22 is established  In Step 372, when the second communication connection 22 is already established in Step 312, or after the second communication connection 22 is established in Step 318, the Nth messaging session, along with any portion of the first client data 17 transferred, is included within the second communication connection 22 for the second messaging client 20 Next, in Step 374, the process determines whether a notification of data transfer is required or requested. In step 376, when a notification is required or requested, the notification is sent. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the notification of data transfer can be sent for each messaging session separately Alternatively, in accordance with the present invention, the notification of data transfer can be sent for all messaging sessions being transferred m one notification message In accordance with the present invention, the notification of data transfer can be sent to at least one of the plurality of messaging clients 12 participating in the Nth messaging session. Alternatively or additionally, the notification of data transfer can be sent to the message server 172 The notification of data transfer can be sent from the first messaging client 14. from the second messaging client 20, from the message server 172, or an equivalent. Preferably, the notification includes the client profile 85 stored in the device in which the second messaging client 20 operates. The message communication system 10,170, including one or more of the plurality of messaging clients 12 and/or the message server 172, can modify the content sent to the second messaging client 20 based on the client profile 85. Next, the process returns to Step 364 in which the counter is incremented.<br>
FIG 18 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of the operation of the messaging communication system 170 in which the plurality of messaging sessions 24 includes the multiple user messaging session 19  The operation begins with Step 378 in which the multiple user messaging session 19 is established within the messaging communication system 170. The multiple user messaging session 19 includes the plurality of session messages 61 among the plurality of messaging clients 12. Next, in Step 380, the process determines whether the first messaging<br><br>
client 12 is participating in the multiple user messaging session 19  When the first messaging client 12 is not participating in the multiple user messaging session 19, the process ends. In Step 381, when the first messaging client 12 is participating in the multiple user messaging session 19, the first communication connection 16 includes the multiple user messaging session 19  Further, the data for the multiple user messaging session 19 is part of the plurality of session data 36 Data for the multiple user messaging session 19 can be, for example, the session identifier 41, the session priority 42. the session preferences 43, the session participants 44 and/or the session history 45 of the multiple user messaging session 19. Next, in Step 304, the process determines whether a data transfer is required or requested   When no data transfer is required or requested in Step 304, the first communication connection 16 including the multiple user messaging session 19 is maintained in Step 381. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the plurality of session data 36 for the multiple user messaging session 19 is updated periodically as the multiple user messaging session 19 continues, (not shown) Next, in Step 310, when a data transfer is requested or required in Step 304 at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 is transferred from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20<br>
Next, in Step 382, a data transfer message 384 is sent to the message server 170  Preferably, the data transfer message 384 is as illustrated in FIG 19  The data transfer message 384 preferably includes a session reservation 385   For example, the session reservation 385 could save a connection within the multiple user messaging session 19 for any messaging client that is being used by the same account identifier used in the first messaging client 14  As shown in FIG 19, the data transfer message 384 alternatively includes the session identifier 41 of the multiple user messaging session 19, the first client identifier 15 of the first messaging client 14, the second client identifier 21 of the second messaging client<br>
within the multiple user messaging session 19 for the second messaging client 20 having the second client identifier 21.   It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the data transfer message 384 can be sent using a network connection, a wireless connection such as through the wireless communication<br>
system 114, a wired connection such as through the wired communication system 89 or the broadcast messaging system 274, or an equivalent<br>
Referring back to FIG 18, next, in Step 383, the second messaging client 20 establishes the second communication connection 22 for participating within the multiple user messaging session 19  In one embodiment of the present invention, the message server 172 can require that Step 383 be performed within a specific time period after it received the data transfer message 384  (not shown) If this time is exceeded, the message server 172 can release the reserved seat to be used by any of the plurality of messaging clients 12.  The operation of the message communication system 170 as illustrated in FIG 18 provides a means for the first account user 29 to ensure that there is an opening within the multiple user messaging session 19 when the first account user 29 transfers at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 (and accordingly the communication means) from the first messaging client 14 to the second messaging client 20. This operation is especially beneficial in situations in which there are a limited number of available openings within the multiple user messaging session 19 and the first account user 29 could lose his/her space during the transfer of data from one messaging client to another messaging client.<br>
FIG. 20 is a signaling flow diagram illustrating an example of the interaction between the elements of the messaging communication system 10,170, according to the present invention.   Specifically, FIG. 20 illustrates the interaction between the first messaging client 14, the second messaging client 20, the messaging client 26, and the message server 172. In accordance with the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 20, a second account user, such as the account user 30, logs onto the messaging client 26 and sends a notification signal 388 to the message server 172. Preferably, the notification signal 388 further includes the second account identifier of the second account user The notification signal 388 for example, includes the connection information (i.e.: IP address and number of the port assigned to the messaging client) of the messaging client 26  Similarly, the first account user 29 logs onto the first messaging client 14 and sends a notification signal 386 to the message server 172 The notification signal 386 for example, includes the connection information (i.e.: IP address and number of the port assigned to the messaging client) of the first messaging client 14  Preferably, thenotification signal 386 also includes the first account identifier of the first account user 29  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that alternatively, the notification signals 386 and 388 can be sent directly to one or more of the plurality of messaging clients 12   In response to receiving the notification signal 386 from the messaging client 26, and receiving the notification signal 388 from the first messaging client 14, the message server 172 sends a client availability signal 390 to the messaging client 26  The client availability signal 390 informs the second account user via the messaging client 26 that the first account user 29 is available for real time electronic communications such as for participation in one or more of the plurality of messaging sessions 24. Similarly, in response to receiving the notification signal 386 from the messaging client 26, and receiving the notification signal 388 from the first messaging client 14, the message server 172 sends a client availability signal 392 to the first messaging client 14. The client availability signal 392 informs the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 that the second account user is available for real time electronic communications such as for participation in one or more of the plurality of messaging sessions 24   Next, the first account user 29 initiates the messaging session 40 with the second account user by sending a session message 394 to the message server 172. The message server 172, acting as a store and forward device, sends a session message signal 396 containing substantially the same message information as the session message 394 to the second account user via the messaging client 26. In response to receiving the session message signal 396, a window is created on the display of the messaging device in which the second messaging client 26 operates and the session message 46, preferably along with the first account identifier of the first account user 29, is displayed in the created window  Next, the second account user via the messaging client 26 sends a response message 398 to the message server 172  The message server 172, acting as a store and forward device, sends a response message signal 400 to the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 containing substantially the same message information as the response message 398. In response to receiving the response message signal 400, the created messaging session window is updated on the display of the messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates and the session message contained within the response message 398, preferably<br>
along with the second account identifier of the second account user, is displayed Although one session message 394 and one response message 398 is illustrated by way of example in FIG 20, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the messaging session 40 between the first account user's first messaging client 14 and the second account user's messaging client 26 can include a plurality of session messages and a plurality of response messages  Further, although the interaction of two account users and two messaging clients is illustrated bv way of example in FIG 20, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the messaging session 40 can include a plurality of messaging clients and an associated plurality of account users. Further, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the session message 394 can be sent directly from the first messaging client 14 to the messaging client 26: and similarly the response message 398 can be sent directly from the messaging client 26 to the first messaging client 14, without the interface of the message server 170, in accordance with the present invention<br>
According to the present invention, an account user can choose to initiate a data transfer. As illustrated in FIG. 20, the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 sends a transfer request signal 402 including at least a portion of the first client data 17 such as the plurality of session data 36 currently contained on the first account user's first messaging client 14 to the message server 172  The transfer request signal 402 preferably also includes a request to the message server 172 to transfer at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 to a new messaging client such as the second messaging client 20. For example, the first messaging client 14 can be a fixed personal computer such as the fixed network device 50 in the office of the first account user 29  The first account user 29 has the need to become mobile  The second messaging client 20 can be a cellular telephone such as the mobile device 90. The first account user 29, according to the present invention, can pass the current messaging session from his/her personal computer to his/her cellular telephone with no loss of communication or of session data    Similarly, the transfer request signal 402 can include a request for the message server 172 to pass the plurality of session data 36 for more than one messaging session  In response to receiving the transfer request signal 402, the message server 172 determines whether the second messaging client 20 is currently connected onto the message server 172 (not shown) For example.<br><br>
the message server 172 determines whether the second messaging client 20 has established the second communication connection 22. When the second messaging client 20 is not currently connected with the message server 172, the message server 172 stores the plurality of session data 36 and/or the first client data 17 if so requested until the second messaging client 20 is connected, (not shown) When the second messaging client 20 is connected to the message server 172, the message server 172 sends the data signal 404 including the plurality of session data 36 and/or any portion of the first client data 17 received from the first messaging client 14 within the transfer request signal 404 to the second messaging client 20  The second messaging client 20 stores the plurality of session data 36 and/or the portion of the first client data 17 in memory and displays the session history 45 for access and use by the first account user 29 on the display of the messaging device m which the second messaging client 20 operates. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the data signal 404 can include the plurality of session data 36 for one messaging session or for a plurality of messaging sessions, or can include the first client data 17 or the client data portion 18 of the first client data 17 for the first messaging client 14. Similarly the messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates can store one messaging session or a plurality of messaging sessions, the first client data 17 or the client data portion 18 of the first client data 17 in its memory m response to receiving the data signal 404. Preferably, in response to receiving the data signal 404, the second messaging client 20 sends an acknowledgement signal 406 to the message server 172    The message server 172 also preferably sends a transfer acknowledgement signal 410 to the first account user's first messaging client 14. The messaging session 40 seamlessly continues between the first account user 29 and the second account user through the second messaging client 20 and the messaging client 26 as illustrated by the plurality of session messages 412 to 422. The messaging session 40 continues seamlessly without the second account user being necessarily aware of the transfer of the first client data from the first account user's first messaging client 14 to his/her second messaging client 20  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that although only a second account user is shown in FIG. 20 by way of example, the messaging session 40 can continue seamlessly between a plurality of account users and associated plurality of messaging clients.<br>
Preferably, the first messaging client 14 is disconnected from the messaging session 40 upon completion of the data transfer  (not shown) It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the first messaging client 14 can be automatically disconnected from the messaging session 40 or alternatively the first messaging client 14 can be disconnected manually by the first account user 29. Similarly, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art the first messaging client 14 can continue to be active in the messaging session 40 along with the second messaging client 20  (not shown)<br>
FIG. 21 is a signaling flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the elements of the messaging communication system 10,170, according to the present invention.   Specifically, FIG 21 illustrates the interaction between the first messaging client 14, the second messaging client 20, the messaging client 26, and the message server 172, according to the present invention. In accordance with the present invention, as illustrated in FIG 21, a second account user, such as the account user 30, logs onto the messaging client 26 and sends a notification signal 388 to the message server 172. For example, the messaging client 26 establishes the communication connection 28. The notification signal 388 for example, includes the connection information (i.e.: IP address and number of the port assigned to the messaging client) of the messaging client 26. Preferably, the notification signal 388 further includes the second account identifier of the second account user.  Similarly, the first account user 29 logs onto the first messaging client 14 and sends a notification signal 386 to the message server 172. For example, the first messaging client 14 establishes the first communication connection 16. The notification signal 386 for example, includes the connection information (i.e.: IP address and number of the port assigned to the messaging client) of the first messaging client 14. Preferably, the notification signal 386 also includes the first account identifier of the first account user 29.   It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that alternatively, the notification signals 386 and 388 can be sent directly to one or more of the plurality of messaging clients 12   In response to receiving the notification signal 386 from the messaging client 26, and receiving the notification signal 388 from the first messaging client 14, the message server 172 sends a client availability signal 390 to the messaging client 26. The client availability signal 390 informs the second account user via the messaging client 26 that the first account user 29 is available for real time electronic communications such as participation in one or more messaging sessions Similarly, in response to receiving the notification signal 386 from the messaging client 26, and receiving the notification signal 388 from the first messaging client 14, the message server 172 sends a client availability signal 392 to the first messaging client 14  The client availability signal 392 informs the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 that the second account user is available for real time electronic communications such as participation in one or more messaging sessions   Next, the first account user 29 initiates the messaging session 40 with the second account user by sending a session message 424 to the message server 172 The message server 172, in response to receiving the session message 424 sends a messaging session participation request 426 to the second account user via the messaging client 26. The messaging client 26 asks the second account user if he/she wants to participate in the messaging session 40 with the first account user 29. When the second account user does not accept the messaging session participation request 426, the process stops, (not shown) When the second account user does accept the messaging session participation request 426, the messaging client 26 sends a messaging session participation acceptance signal 428 to the message server 172. The message server 172, in response to receiving the messaging session participation acceptance signal 428, sends a session message signal 396 containing substantially the same message information as the session message 424 to the second account user via the messaging client 26  In response to receiving the session message signal 396, a window is created on the display of the messaging device in which the messaging client 26 operates and the session message 46, preferably along with the first account identifier of the first account user 29, is displayed on the created window  Next, the second account user via the messaging client 26 sends a response message 398 to the message server 172. The message server 172, acting as a store and forward device, sends a response message signal 400 to the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 containing substantially the same message information as the response message 398  In response to receiving the response message signal 400, the open display window is updated on the display of the messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates and the session message, preferably along with the second account identifier of the second account user, is displayed  Although one session message 396 and one response message 398 is illustrated by way of example in FIG 21, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the messaging session 40 between the first account user's first messaging client 14 and the second account user's messaging client 26 can include a plurality of session messages and a plurality of response messages. Further, although the interaction of two account users and two messaging clients is illustrated by way of example in FIG 21, it will be appreciated by one of ordinal}' skill in the art that the messaging session can include a plurality of messaging clients and an associated plurality of account users According to the present invention, an account user can choose to initiate a data transfer. As illustrated in FIG. 21, the first account user 29 via the second messaging client 20 sends a transfer request signal 430 to the first account user's first messaging client 14.  In response, the first messaging client 14 sends a connection discovery and verification signal 432 to the second messaging client 20 The second messaging client 20 then sends an acknowledgement signal 434 to the first messaging client 14  The acknowledgement signal 434 preferably includes verification data in which the first messaging client 14 can verify the validity of the second messaging client 20. The first messaging client 14 then sends a data signal 436 to the second messaging client 20  In a preferred embodiment, the second messaging client 20includes session transfer capabilities. Alternatively, the messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates includes the data transfer application 83. The first account user 29 launches the data transfer application 83 or alternatively the data transfer capabilities of the second messaging client 20, and utilizes the data transfer application 83 and/or the second messaging client 20 to achieve the transfer of at least a portion of the first client data 17 including the plurality of session data 36 from the first messaging client 14  The data transfer application 83 stores first client data received including the plurality of session data 36 for the messaging session 40 in the memory of the messaging device and launches the second messaging client 20 if it is not already active  The messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates displays the session history 45 for access and use by the first account user 29 on the messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the session data signal 436 can include the<br><br>
plurality of session data 36 for one messaging session or for a plurality of messaging sessions, or can include the first client data 17 or the client data portion 18 of the first client data 17 for the first messaging client 14. Similarly the messaging device in which the second messaging client 20 operates can store one messaging session or a plurality of messaging sessions, the first client data 17 or the client data portion 18 of the first client data 17 in its memory in response to receiving the session data signal 436.<br>

FIG. 22 is a signaling flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the elements of the messaging communication system 10,170, according to the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 22 illustrates the interaction between the first messaging client 14, the second messaging client 20, the messaging client 26, and the message server 172 In accordance with the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 22, a second account user, such as the account user 30, logs onto the messaging client 26 and sends a notification signal 388 to the message server 172 For example, the messaging client 26 establishes the communication connection 28<br>
The notification signal 388 for example, includes the connection information (i.e ■ IP address and number of the port assigned to the messaging client) of the messaging client 26. Preferably, the notification signal 388 further includes the second account identifier of the second account user. Similarly, the first account user 29 logs onto the first messaging client 14 and sends a notification signal 386 to the message server 172. For example, the first messaging client 14 establishes the first communication connection 16. The notification signal 386 for example, includes the connection information ;i e. IP address and number of the port assigned to the messaging client) of the first messaging client 14  Preferably, the notification signal 386 also includes the first account identifier of the first account user 29  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that alternatively, the notification signals 386 and 388 can be sent directly to one or more of the plurality of messaging clients 12.  In response to receiving the notification signal 386 from the messaging client 26, and receiving the notification signal 388 from the first messaging client 14, the message server 172 sends a client availability signal 390 to the messaging client 26. The client availability signal 390 informs the second account user via the messaging client 26 that the first account user 29 is available for real time electronic communications such as participation in one or more of the plurality of messaging sessions 24. Similarly, m response to receiving the notification signal 386 from the messaging client 26, and receiving the notification signal 388 from the first messaging client 14, the message server 172 sends a client availability signal 392 to the first messaging client 14  The client availability signal 392 informs the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 that the second account user is available for real time electronic communications such as participation in one or more of the plurality of messaging sessions 24.   Next, the first account user 29 initiates the messaging session 40 with the second account user by sending a session message 424 to the message server 172. The message server 172, in response to receiving the real time electronic message 424 sends a messaging session participation request 426 to the second account user via the messaging client 26 The messaging client 26 asks the second account user if he/she wants to participate in the messaging session 40 with the first account user 29  When the second account user does not accept the messaging session participation request 426, the process stops, (not shown) When the second account user does accept the messaging session participation request 426, the messaging client 26 sends a messaging session participation acceptance signal 428 to the message server 172  The message server 172, in response to receiving the messaging session participation acceptance signal 428, sends a session message signal 396 containing substantially the same message information as the session message 424 to the second account user via the messaging client 26. In response to receiving the session message signal 396, a window is created on the display of the messaging device in which the messaging client 26 operates and the session message 46, preferably along with the first account identifier of the first account user 29, is displayed. Next, the second account user via the messaging client 26 sends a response message 398 to the message server 172. The message server 172, acting as a store and forward device, sends a response message signal 400 to the first account user 29 via the first messaging client 14 containing substantially the same message information as the response message 398. In response to receiving the response message signal 400, the open display window is updated on the display of the messaging device in which the first messaging client 14 operates and the session message, preferably along with the second account identifier of the second account user, is displayed. Although one session message 396 and one response message 398 is illustrated by way of example in FIG 22, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the messaging session 40 between the first account user's first messaging client 14 and the second account user's messaging client 26 can include a plurality of session messages and a plurality of response messages.
