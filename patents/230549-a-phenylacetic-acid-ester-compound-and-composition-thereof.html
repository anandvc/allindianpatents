Background of (he Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to novel substituted phenylacetic acid ester compounds which are useful as short-acting sedative hypnotic agents for anesthesia and sedation. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds; methods for using such compounds for inducing or maintaining anesthesia or sedation; and intermediates for preparing such compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, (Diprivan® Injectable Emulsion, AstraZeneca) Is an injectable' anesthetic that has hypnotic properties. It can be used to induce and maintain general anesthesia and for sedation. Although prcpofol is a widely-used anesthetic, its usefulness is somewhat limited due to its long and unpredictable post infusion duration of action. This unpredictable duration of action leads to irregular and often long patient recovery times that are undesirable.<br>
Propanidid [4-[{N,N'-diediylcaibamoyl)methoxy]-3-methoxyphenyl] acetic acid propyl ester), is another injectable anesthetic that has been approved for use in several countries outside the United States. Although propanidid provides a much shorter and predictable recovery time than propofol, it is not as potent an anesthetic.   Additionally, Epontol®, an injectable emulsion formulation of propanidid, provided by Bayer, was withdrawn from the market in Great Britain in 1983 because of concern over anaphylactoid reactions. Thus, in spite of the fact that propanidid provides shorter and more predictable recovery times than propofol, it has not been accepted widely as an injectable anesthetic.<br>
Currently there is a need for novel injectable anesthetic agents. Preferred agents will have a shorter and more predictable duration of action than propofol. Preferred agents will also be more potent than propanidid.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Applicants have discovered novel substituted phenylacetic acid ester compounds which are useful as short-acting sedative hypnotic agents. The agents have a shorter and more predictable duration of action than propofol and are also more potent than propanidid.<br><br><br>
wherein R' and R' are as defined herein and R is hydrogen or hydroxyl.<br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (1).<br>
The compounds of the invention are highly effective short-acting sedative hypnotic agents for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and sedation. Accordingly, the invention also provides a method for inducing or maintaining anesthesia or sedation in a mamma!, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound of the invention. The invention also provides a method for inducing or maintaining anesthesia or sedation in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
FIG, I compares the dose in mg/lcg of compounds of the invention to produce a mean loss of righting reflex of 2 minutes in rats with the dose required of the prior art compound, propanidid.<br>
FIG. 2 compares the total recovery time in minutes following termination of infusions of 20 minutes, 3 hours, and 5 hours in rats of compound 1 of the present invention with the recovery time following termination of infusion of the prior art compounds propanidid and propofol,<br>

General Synthetic Procedures<br>
The intermediates and compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using known synthetic procedures. For example, the compounds can be prepared as outlined generally below and further described in the Examples. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e..<br><br>
reaction temperatures, limes, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used uniess otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled m the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as Well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
The present synthetic methods make use of novel intermediates of formula (II}, specificaiiy (Ua) or (lib):<br><br>
In a first method of synthesis, compounds of formula (I) are prepared by alkylating a compound of formula (Ila) with the requisite compound of formula X-CH2C(=0)NRR, wherein X is a suitable leaving group (e.g. chloro, bromo, tosyi, or mesyi.)<br>
In a second method of synthesis, compounds of formula (lib) are alkylated with the requisite acetamide compounds of formula X-CH2C(=0)NRR' to produce a compound of formula (IH):<br><br><br>
which is reduced to form a compound of formula (I). As exemplified in Examples 4 A, 4B, and 10-13, a useful method of reduction proceeds by a two-step reaction in which the hydroxyl of formula (III) is first acetylated, before reaction with hydrogen.<br>
The mtermediate of formula (lib) used in the above procedure is prepared from commerciaily available starting materials and reagents using conventional procedures. For example, the intermediate can be prepared as shown in Scheme A:<br><br>
As illustrated above, catechol is coupled with a compound of formula R X, where X is a leaving group, to form the ether (IV) which is reacted with glyoxylic acid to produce compound (V). Subsequentreactionof(V) with an excess of the alcohol R'OH provides the intermediate of formula (lib). The intermediate (lib) can be alkylated as described above to produce a compound of formula (III).<br>
The intermediate of formula (la) can be prepared, for example, as described in Example 1 sub-part (1) and also as illustrated in Scheme B in Example 1 sub-part (2) below.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The compounds of formula I can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as an animal or a human patient, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.<br>
Thus, the present compounds can be systeraically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, can be compressed into tablets, or can be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and prepai-ations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations can, of course, be varied and can conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like can also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as com starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring can be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oU or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials can be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules can be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like, A syrup or elixir can contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound can be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.<br><br>
Active agents described herein are typically formulated as pharmaceutical compositions which are suitabie for intravenous administration. The present active agents are relatively insoluble in water. Thus, for intravenous administration, the agents are typically formulated in aqueous media using one or more water-immiscible solvent and one or more emulsifier. Some emulsifiers are variously termed surfactants in the literature. Individual formulations can include one or more additional components such as stabilizers, tonicity modifiers, bases or acids to adjust pH, and solubilizers. The formulations can also optionally contain a preservative, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or sodium metabisulfite, to name only a few.<br>
A wide range of water-irruniscible solvents can be used in the compositions of the present invention. The water-immiscible solvent can be a vegetable oil, for example soybean, safflower, cottonseed, com, sunflower, arachis, castor or olive oil. Alternatively, the water-immiscible solvent is an ester of a medium or long-chain fatty acid, for example, a mono-, di-, or triglyceride; an ester of a combination of a medium and long-chain fatty acid, or is a chemically modified or manufactured material such as ethyl oleate, isopropyi myristate, isopropyl palmirate, a glycerol ester, polyoxyl, or hydrogenated castor oil. The water-immiscible solvent can also be a marine oil, for example cod liver or another fish-derived oil. Suitable solvents also include fractionated oils, for example, fractionated coconut-oil or modified soy bean oil.<br>
The compositions can also comprise an emulsifier. Suitable emulsifiers include synthetic non-ionic emulsifiers, for example ethoxylated ethers and esters and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymers, and phosphoiipids. Both naturally-occurring phospholipids, such as egg and soya phospholipids, and modified or artificially manipulated phospholipids, for example prepared by physical fractionation and/or chromatography, or mixtures thereof can be used. Phospholipids are alternatively termed phosphatides. Preferred emulsifiers are egg phospholipids and soya phosphoiipids. Egg yolk phospholipids are principally composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanol amine. Lecithin, which is classified as a phosphatidylcholine, and which can be derived from egg yolk or soybeans, is another commonly used emulsifier.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations can also include stabilizing agents, which can alternatively be considered as co-emulsifiers. Anionic stabilizers include phosphatidylethanoiamines, conjugated with polyethylene glycol, (PEG-PE) and phosphatidyl glycerols, a specific example of which is dimyristolphosphatidylgylcerol<br><br>
(DMPG). Additional examples of useful stabilizers include oleic acid and its sodium salt, choiic acid and deoxycholic acid and their respective salts, cationic lipids such as stearylaminc and oleylamine, and 3&gt;9-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)carbamQyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be made isotonic with blood by the incorporation of a suitable tonicity modifier. Glycerol is most frequently used as a tonicity modifier. Alternative tonicity modifying agents include xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, The pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be at physiologically neutral pH, typically in the range 6.0-8.5. The pH can be adjusted by the addition of base, for example NaOH or NaHCOs, or in some cases acid, such as HCl.<br>
Pharmaceutically safe oil-water emulsions comprising a vegetable oil, a phosphatide emulsifier, typically egg lecithin or soybean lecithin, and a tonicity modifier are provided commercially for parenteral nutrition, for example, under the tradenames Liposyn® II and Liposyn® HI (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and Intralipid® (Fresenius Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden.) The agents described herein can be formulated with these or other similar oil-water emulsions, as shown, for example, in injections 5 through 9 of Example 16 below.<br>
A compound of the invention can also be formulated in a triglyceride comprising esters of at least one medium chain length (Q-Cn) fatty acid. Preferably the triglyceride comprises an ester of a Cg-Cio fatty acid. Triglycerides suitable for formulating a compound of the invention are provided uirder the tradename Miglyol© by Condea Chemie GmbH (Witten, Germany.). For example, Migiyol® 810 or 812 (caprylic (Cjo)/capric (Cg) glyceride)are useful for formulation of the present agents. Injection i 1 of Example 16 below shows a formulation including egg yolk phosphatides as the emulsifier, DMPG as an anionic stabilizer, and glycerol as the tonicity modifier, in which Miglyol® 810 is used as the oil phase.<br>
Additionally, the agents described herein can be formulated analogously to pharmaceutical compositions of propanidid known to the art. For example, compounds of the invention can be formulated in nuxtures including an ester of a medium chain length fatty acid, as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,711,902. Furthermore, the compounds described herein can be formulated analogously to compositions of propofol known to the art as described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos, 4,056,635; 4,452,817; and 4,798,846.<br>
In yet another alternative, the present compounds can be formulated using a soiubilizer, for example, hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin, to form an inclusion complex.<br><br>
StiU other suitable formulations for use in the present invention can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th ed, (1985).<br>
Compounds according to the present invention are potent hypnotic agents wiiich are metabolized rapidly in vivo to an inactive and well-tolerated carboxyUc acid metabolite {Formula I where R is hydrogen.) The present compounds exhibit one or more of the following beneficial properties as compared with previous agents; increased patency, shorter recover times, reduced cardiovascular effects, lower toxicity, and higher therapeutic index, where therapeutic index is defined as the ratio of maximum tolerated dose to effective dose.<br>
Thus, compounds of the present invention can be used for the induction and/or maintenance of general anesthesia, for the initiation and/or maintenance of conscious sedation with patients spontaneously breathing, and for the induction and/or maintenance of sedation for intubated, mechanically ventilated patients.<br>
The amount of an active agent required for use in the methods of the invention will vary with the route of administration, the age and condition of the patient, and the degree of anesthesia or sedation required, and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.<br>
In general, the agents can be administered as an initial bolus dose to produce anesthesia or sedation, followed by a continuous infusion of agent at a rate that is sufficient to achieve and maintain the level of anesthesia or sedation desired. Alternatively, a continuous infusion of an agent of the present invention can be used to maintain anesthesia or sedation following induction or induction and maintenance with another sedative hypnotic agent, (e.g. propofol, a barbiturate, such as nembutal® (pentobarbital sodium) or brevital® sodium (methohexital sodium), or a benzodiazepine, such as vahum®).<br>
For example, a suitable bolus dose of the present agent for a human patient will typically be in the range of from about 0.1 to about 50 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg), preferably about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg. The rate of infusion will typically be in the range from about 5 to about 5000 micrograms/kilogram/minute (jig/kg/min), preferably about 10 to about 2000 [ig/kg/min.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as, for example, other sedative hypnotic agents, analgesics (e.g. an opioid such as die |i-opioid agonist remifentanil, fentanyl, suifentanil, or<br><br>
aifentanil), or paralytic agents, such as atracurium besylate or pancuronium bromide. Accordingly, the compositions of the invention can optionally further comprise another therapeutic agent, for example, a sedative hypnotic agent, anajgesic, or paralytic agent. Similarly, the therapeutic methods of the invention can also optionally comprise administering another therapeutic agent (e.g. a sedative hypnotic agent, analgesic, or paralytic agent) to the mammal.<br>
The ability of an agent to function as an anesthetic or a sedative can be determined using assays that are known in the art (for example see U.S. Patent Number 5,908,869, or R. James and J. Glen, J. Med Chem.. 23, 1350 (1980)) or using the assay described in Test A, below.<br>
Test A. Methods Formulation<br>
Test compounds, e.g., representative compounds of the invention as well as the comparison compound, propanidid, were formulated in (1) 10% cremophor El_/90% D5W (5% dextrose in distilled water;) (2) 10% Liposyn® DI (Intravenous Fat Emulsion, containing (per 100 mL) 10 g soybean oil, 1.2 g egg phosphatides and 25 g glycerol), available from Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL; and (3) injections (10) or (U) (as described in Example 16) with Miglyol® 810 (caprylic/capric glyceride). Typically, formulation (1) above was used for bolus dosing and formulations (2) or (3) for infusion dosing. Compounds of the invention and propanidid were synthesized as described in Examples 1-15 below. Propofoi formulated in soybean oil, sold as Diprivan® injectable emulsion was obtained from AstraZeneca (Wilmington, DE).<br>
Bolus administration (rats)<br>
Rats (adult male Sprague-Dawley) were placed in a perspex resfrainer and injected (1 or 2 loL/kg over approximately 3 seconds) with the compound of interest via the tail vein. The time to onset of anesthesia (defined as a loss of righting reflex), duration of anesthesia (i.e. duration of loss of righting reflex) and behavioral recovery (i.e. duration of ataxia, sedation and/or lethargy following the return of the righting reflex) was recorded. Duration of anesthesia was measured by placing the rats On their baclfs following onset of anesthesia and the time until recovery of the righting reflex was recorded using a stop clock. The depth of anesthesia was assessed intermitiendy by<br><br>
observing the magnitude of the withdrawal reflex to noxious pinch of the hind paw. Behavioral recovery was assessed by visual observation.<br>
Bolus administration (guinea pigs)<br>
Adult male guinea pigs were dosed by bolus administration (0.1 - 0.25 mL volume) via an ear vein. Duration of loss of righting reflex was measured as described above for rats.<br>
Administration by infusion (rats)<br>
Rats (adult Sprague-Dawley) were placed in a perspex restrainer and anesthesia induced by bolus injection via the tail vein (0.15-1 mL/kg over approximately 3 seconds at a dose, estimated from the earlier bolus experiments, to produce anesthesia of approximately 2 minutes duration). Immediately after bolus administration, an infusion (with a duration of typically 20, 180 or 300 minutes), via the tail vein, was commenced (0.O75-0.5 mL/kg/min at a half of the bolus dose/min). In some experiments, the initial infusion rate was maintained throughout, wiiile in others, the rate was modified as necessary to maintain a consistent depth of anesthesia (as defined by moderate paw withdrawal in response to noxious pinch). Following completion of the infusion, duration of anesthesia (i.e. duration of loss of righting reflex) and behavioral recovery (i.e. duration of ataxia, sedation or lethargy following return of the righting reflex) was recorded.<br>
Results<br>
Bolus administration (rats): The dose response curve for duration of loss of righting reflex in rats resulting from bolus injection of test compounds prepared in formulation (1) was determined. To quantify anesthetic potency, the doses of test compound which produced a mean loss of righting reflex of 2 minutes was calculated. FIG. 1 compares the bolus dose of compounds of the invention in mg/kg producing 2 minutes of loss of righting reflex with the requ ired dose of the comparison compound, propanidid.<br>
Bolus administration (guinea pigs): The potency of compound 1 was also tested in guinea pigs by the analogous procedure. The dose of compound 1 required to produce 2 minutes of loss of righting reflex in guinea pigs was calculated to be 8 mg/kg, as compared with a dose of 13 mg/kg for propanidid.<br><br><br><br>
Administration by infiisioD frats): Recovery times following termination of administration by Infusion in rats were determined for compound 1 and for the comparison compounds propofol and propanidid. The duration of the loss of righting reflex (in minutes) following termination of infusion is given as a function of duration of infusion in Table 2 below.<br>
FIG. 2 shows total recovery times in minutes following temnination of infusion of specified duration in rats, as the sum of the duration of the loss of righting reflex, as given in Table 2, and the duration of behavioral recovery after the return of the righting reflux.<br>
As demonstrated by the above data in the rat and guinea pig animal models, compounds of the invention tested are more potent general anesthetics than propanidid, and provide significantly shorter total recovery rates than propofol, even after long (5 hour) infusions. In addition, the duration of loss of righting reflex following termination of infusion for the tested compound of the invention was independent of the duration of infusion within the uncertainty of (he experimental results.<br>
The in vitro stahihty of representative compounds of the invention can be determined as described in Test B.<br>
Tests Source of whole blood samples<br>
Rat and guinea pig whole blood samples, obtained by cardiac puncture, were collected in vacutainer tubes containing sodium heparin. The samples were Icept in ice and used the same day of collection. Dog, monkey and human whole blood, purchased from commercial vendors, was maintained on wet ice and used the day following collection.<br><br>
Metabolism assay<br>
The test compounds, propanidid and a representative compound of the invention, were spiked into 300 tiL of a whole blood sample to a final concentration of 100 )iM. The proteins were immediately precipitated with the addition of twice the volume of ice-cold ethanot and vortex mixing. This constituted the zero time point. In identical 300 }xL incubations, spiked whole blood samples were then incubated at 37°C for 30 seconds to 60 minutes. At a predetermined time point, 600 ftL of ice-coid ethanol was added to the mixture to terminate the incubation. Following termination of the incubation, tiie samples were centtifuged and the supematants dried under a stream of nitrogen at room temperature, The residue was reconstituted in 150 pL of sterile water and then centrifuged. An aliquot (50 fjX,) of the supernatant was injected to EIPLC-UV for analysis.<br>
HPLC method<br>
A Cig, 5(im, 2 X ISOmra I.D (LUNA, Phenomenex) reverse-phase HPLC column was used and a gradient from 10% to 68% acetonitrile over 15 minutes followed by a 5 minute isocratic run at 10% acetonitrile was used, The mobile phase components contained 0.1%TFA. The analytes were monitored by UV detection at214nm.<br>
Data analysis<br>
Concentrations of the substrate in incubates were measured as peak area ratios using the internal standard method and percent degradation was measured relative to the zero time values.<br>
Results<br>
The tested compounds of formula (I) were metabolized rapidly to the corresponding carboxylic acids (formula (I) wherein R = hydrogen). The acid metabolites were found to be inactive as anesthetics in Test A. The rapid conversion of the compounds of formula (I) to their acid metabolites, and the inactivity.of these acid metabolites as anesthetics, may be at least partially responsible for the shorter and more predictable recovery rates observed for the compounds of formula (I).<br>

The above formulations may be obtained by conventional procedures well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, a formulation of compound 1 according to Injection 9 was prepared by the following procedure.<br>
A mixture of L-a-phosphatidylcholine 60 % (lecithin f2.40 g), glycerol (98 %') (2.50 g), (both from Sigma-Aldrich), oleic acid (99 %) (0.03 g) (Fluka-Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) and deionized water (71.1 g) was heated at 60 °C until fully dissoived giving an opaque solution. The pH was adjusted to pH 8 while the solution was still warm by addition of 0.1 N NaOH. A mixture of compound j, (4.0 g) and soybean oil (Sigma-Aldrich) (20.0 g) was heated to 60 °C until miscible and then added to the first mixture. The solution was stirred briefly at 60 °C and then transferred to a beaker and stirred with a Polytron tissue homogenizer for 5 min at maximum speed to provide a premixed solution.<br>
A microfluidizer (Microfiuidics Corp., Newton, MA, model no. IIOS) was washed with isopropano! and then deionized water. The microfluidizer were primed with a minimal amount of the premixed solution. The reservoir of the microfluidizer was filled with the premixed solution and the solution was circulated through the mixing chamber for 30 sec at maximum pressure (-12000-15000 psi). The first -10 drops of microflutdized solution were collected and discarded, then all subsequent fractions were collected in a glass vial.<br>
