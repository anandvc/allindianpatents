OROMUCOSAL      FORMULATION     AND      PROCESS      FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an oromucosal formulation comprising as an active ingredient a substituted imidazole derivative of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein Y is -CH2- or -CO-, R1 is halogen or hydroxy, R2 is H or halogen and R3 is H or lower alkyl, or an acid addition salt thereof.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing the oromucosal formulation in questien.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the above-mentioned formula (1) are highly selective and long-acting antagonists of 012-adrenoceptors. The compounds are especially valuable in the treatment of cognitive disorders. Compounds of formula (I) and their preparation have been described in patent publication EP 0 618 906 Bl. Specific examples of such compounds are 4-(2-ethyl-5-fluoroindan-2-yl)-1H-imidazole, i.e. fipamezole, and 4-(5-fluoroindan-2-yl)~1f/-imidazole.<br>
Although the compounds of formula (I) and their salts have good properties as such, they have disadvantages, when formulated for conventional oral administration, i.e. the normal route for administering said compounds. A problem is that the compounds rather quickly decompose in the gastrointestinal area or other body systems prior to accessing systemic blood flow and the therapeutic target organs. This in turn significantly lowers the effect of the compounds in question.<br>
Toxicology studies carried out with dogs (see Example 3) have further  suggested  that  cardiac  safety  considerations  are  of importance<br><br>
whereas QT prolongation was observed with high oral doses of fipamezole when the systemic concentration of fipamezole reached about 2000 ng/ml.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a formulation for administering compounds of formula (I) safely and efficiently.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the formulation.<br>
Thus,  according  to one aspect of this invention  concerns an -oromucosal formulation comprising as an active ingredient a substituted imidazole derivative of formula (I)<br><br>
where Y is -CH2- or -CO-, R1 is halogen or hydroxy, R2 is H or halogen and R3 is H or lower alky!, or an acid addition salt thereof, together with additives conventionally used in oromucosal formulations.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention concerns a process for preparing the oromucosal formulation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the problems of quick decomposition in the gastrointestinal area and compromised cardiac safety of the compounds of formula (I) can be alleviated by formulating the compounds of formula (I) into oromucosal formulations. Such formulations are effective and easy to handle, and therefore they have an advantage in terms of practical administration to the patient.<br>
Suitable additives to be used in the formulation according to the present invention are adjuvants, expedients etc. including solvents, preserving agents, flavouring agents, fillers, gelling agents and mucoadhesive polymers. Preferred solvents are alcohols, especially ethanol, water and mixtures thereof. Preferred preserving agents are lower alkyl parahydroxybenzoates, especially methyl and  propyl  parahydroxybenzoate, and  mixtures thereof.  Preferred<br><br>
flavouring agents are aspartame, artificial flavours, such as black currant 502.009, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In this context, the oromucosal formulation means any type of formulation administered via oral mucosa. Such formulations include e.g. sprays, gels, mucoadhesive buccal tablets and pastes, sublingual tablets and like. The formulation is preferably in the form of a spray.<br>
In this context, the term halogen refers to F, CI, Br and I, preferably to F and CI and most preferably to F.<br>
In this context, the term lower alkyl refers to a monoradical branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chain having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms and most preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms.<br>
In this context, the term an acid addition salt refers to an addition salt of any pharmaceutically acceptable acid, preferably hydrochloric acid.<br>
In this context, the term an additive conventionally used in oromucosal formulations refers to any additive known by the person skilled in the art to be applicable for oromucosal formulations.<br>
An especially preferred active ingredient is fipamezole (JP-1730, 4-(2-ethyI-5-fluoroindan-2yl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride). A formulation containing said preferred active ingredient is prepared according to the invention by mixing and dissolving ethanol (96%), purified water, methylparahydroxybenzoate, propylparahydroxybenzoate and aspartame at room temperature, at +15 to +25 °C. Followed by adding and dissolving 4-(2-ethyl-5-fluoroindan-2-yI)-1H-imidazole and artificial flavour, such as black currant 502.009A, at room temperature, at +15 to +25 °C. The volume of the mixture is adjusted with purified water, followed by filtering and the desired spray formulation is recovered.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention, but are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention.<br><br>

Example 3<br>
Preparation of a spray formulation containing 4-{2-ethyI-5-fluoroindan-2-yl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (fipamezole)<br>
416.0 ml of ethanol (96%) was mixed with 450.0 ml of purified water to form a homogenous mixture. 1.80 g of methylparahydroxybenzoate, 0.20 g of propyiparahydroxybenzoate and 0.5 g of aspartame were added to the mixture and dissolved at room temperature, at +15 to +25 °C. 15.0 g of fipamezole, 0.4 g of black currant flavour were added to the mixture and dissolved at room temperature, at +15 to +25 °C. The volume of the mixture was adjusted to 1000.0 ml with purified water. The solution was filtered and the desired spray formulation was recovered.<br>
Example 4<br><br>
Method of preparation	<br>
Fipamezoie (1) and ethanol (96 %) (2) are mixed and dissolved to form a solution A. Purified water (6), poloxamer 407 (3), liquid flavour (4), and aspartame (5) are mixed and dissolved to fo<br>
rm a solution B. Solution A and<br><br>
solution B are cooled down to approx. +5 °C, and mixed together to form a homogenous solution. Oromucosal gel formulation is recovered.<br><br>
Method of preparation<br>
Fipamezoie (1), carbomer 934P (2), hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose (3), flavour (4), aspartame (5), and magnesium stearate (6) are mixed to form a homogenous mixture. The mixture is compressed to tablets of a suitable size. Mucoadhesive buccal tablets are recovered.<br><br><br>
_ Method of preparation Fipamezole (1), lactose monohydrate (2), flavour (5), and aspartame (6) are mixed to form a homogenous mixture. The mixture is granulated with 10 % aqueous solution of povidone (3). Granules are formed in either high-shear or low-shear mixer. Granulated mixture is let to dry. Dryt granulated mixture is passed through a screen to obtain freely flowing granulate. Microcrystalline cellulose (4) and magnesium stearate (7) are mixed with the granulate. The final blend is compressed to tablets of a suitable size. Sublingual tablets are recovered.<br>
Example 7<br>
Oromucosal delivery of fipamezole<br>
Plasma levels of fipamezole were studied in healthy male volunteers after oral administration of the drug as a solution. Blood samples for pharmcokinetic  evaluation   were   collected   for  24   hours   after  the   drug<br><br>
administration. The concentration of fipamezole in plasma was measured with HPLC-MS/MS, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The pharmacokinetics of fipamezole was evaluated with TopFit 2.0 pharmacokinetic program. The Cmax and tmax values were read from the concentration vs. time curves, and the apparent elimination phase half-lives from the terminal part of the semilogarithmic concentration vs. time curve (see Figure 1). AUC values were calculated both to infinity and up to the last collection time with quantifiable fipamezole concentration. The results are given in Table 1.<br><br>
Cmax, maximal drug concentration in serum; tmax, time of maxima! drug concentration in serum; t1/2ei, apparent elimination phase half-life; AUC0-inf, area under the drug concentration in serum vs. time curve from time 0 to infinity.<br>
Mean plasma concentration time plot following single dose administration of 30 mg fipamezole via an oral, oromucosal spray and an oromucosal tablet on a semilogarithmic scale is shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
Example 8 Cardiac safety<br>
Cardiac safety was studied in dogs in a 30-day dog toxicology study using oral dosing and dog toxicology studies using buccal dosing.<br>
in the 30-day dog toxicology study fipamezole was administered orally at doses of 1, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in maximum systemic fipamezole concentrations of about 200,1000, 2000 and 3300 ng/ml, respectively. These in vivo results in the dog suggested that QT prolongation was observed when the systemic concentration of fipamezole reached about 2000 ng/ml.<br>
In another toxicology study four male dogs were given fipamezole in buccal spray doses of 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg in a sequential dosing regimen with 5 to 15 days between doses. Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean), heart rate and ECGs were monitored before and up to 12 hours after dosing. At 30 minutes after dosing with 5 and 10 mg/kg significant transient increases in absolute values for blood pressure and heart rate were observed. No ECG changes (P wave amplitude, P wave duration, P-Q interval, QRS interval or Q-T [Q-Tcv, QTc] interval) were apparent after fipamezole dosing at each dose level.<br>
Yet another toxicology study using buccal delivery to dogs at dose levels of 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks showed no apparent changes in ECG. Maximum systemic concentrations of fipamezole after dosing on the first day of this study were about 800, 2000 and 3300 ng/ml.<br><br><br>
