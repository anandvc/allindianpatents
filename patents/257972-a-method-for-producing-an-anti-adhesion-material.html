DESCRIPTION<br>
ANTI-ADHESION MEMBRANE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an anti-adhesion<br>
membrane that has no toxicity to a living body, has<br>
flexibility allowing itself to fit an affected part as a<br>
hydrated gel, is uniformly crosslinked, and is immediately<br>
absorbed in a living body after maintaining its shape in<br>
the living body for a certain period of time.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
After a surgical operation, living body tissues often<br>
adhere to one another to cause a pain or a functional<br>
disorder. Adhesion occurs as a serious problem especially<br>
in a field such as obstetrics and gynecology, digestive<br>
surgery, orthopedics, and cardiovascular surgery, and a<br>
severe case requires an operation to separate the adhesion.<br>
In addition, occurrence of an adhesion increases risk upon<br>
a re-operation of a primary disease. As a method for<br>
preventing the adhesion of living body tissues, there has<br>
been proposed a method for isolating an area with a<br>
possibility of occurrence of the adhesion using a membrane<br>
called an anti-adhesion material.<br>
[0003]<br>
The anti-adhesion material is required to have<br>
properties as follows: having flexibility that allows<br>
itself to fit an affected part as a hydrated gel; being<br>
immediately absorbed by a living body after maintaining its<br>
shape in the living body for a certain period of time;<br>
causing only slight tissue reaction; and the like. As an<br>
anti-adhesion material satisfying the above-mentioned<br><br>
properties, there has been proposed an anti-adhesion<br>
material comprising a film containing gelatin (for example,<br>
Patent Documents 1 to 6) . Gelatin is a polymer derived<br>
from a living body, and has an excellent biocompatibility<br>
and the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, gelatin films, as they are, absorb water in<br>
a living body so as to swell greatly, or are degraded in a<br>
very short period of time so as to be deformed. For these<br>
reasons, there have been problems that the gelatin films<br>
are difficult to handle and fail to produce sufficient<br>
effects on prevention of adhesion. In order to solve the<br>
problems, Patent Documents 1 to 6 disclose that<br>
crosslinking of a film containing gelatin by a suitable<br>
method allows the film to have a suitable water-containing<br>
property and suitable degradation. For example, Patent<br>
Documents 1, 4, 5, and 6 disclose ultraviolet-crosslinking,<br>
and Patent Documents 2 and 3 disclose a chemical<br>
crosslinking agent used in a combination.<br>
However, there has been a problem that an anti-<br>
adhesion material comprising an ultraviolet-crosslinked<br>
gelatin film may be deformed in a living body at an early<br>
stage of use, in spite of its high degree of crosslinking.<br>
On the other hand, the method of using a chemical<br>
crosslinking agent has a problem of a residue of a<br>
crosslinking agent or generation of a by-product derived<br>
from the crosslinking agent upon degradation in a living<br>
body.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
The present inventors found out that nonuniform<br>
crosslinking formed in an anti-adhesion material comprising<br>
an ultraviolet-crosslinked gelatin film causes early<br>
deformation of the anti-adhesion material in a living body,<br>
in spite of its high degree of crosslinking. That is, in<br>
case of obtaining a crosslinked gelatin film by irradiation<br>
with ultraviolet rays, the gelatin absorbs the ultraviolet<br>
rays, resulting in a higher degree of crosslinking in a<br>
part relatively closer to the surface of the gelatin film<br>
but a lower degree of crosslinking in a part deep in the<br>
thickness direction. Especially, in case of using gelatin<br>
containing impurities, irradiating the impurities with<br>
ultraviolet rays causes deterioration and discolor in a<br>
part of gelatin, leading to absorption of more ultraviolet<br>
rays. In case of disposing, in a living body, an anti-<br>
adhesion material comprising the above-mentioned gelatin<br>
film crosslinked nonuniformly in the thickness direction,<br>
although stable appearance of its shape immediately after<br>
an operation, degradation of a part neighboring a central<br>
part with a low degree of crosslinking proceeds rapidly,<br>
and subseguently the central part disappears, resulting in<br>
failure to maintain its shape. In addition, the anti-<br>
adhesion material comprising the gelatin film nonuniformly<br>
crosslinked causes a problem of an inferior property such<br>
as poor tensile strength to that of an anti-adhesion<br>
material comprising a gelatin film uniformly crosslinked as<br>
a whole.<br><br>
Moreover, the method for using a chemical<br>
crosslinking agent causes problems of a residue of the<br>
crosslinking agent and release of a substance having a low<br>
molecular weight due to degradation of a crosslinked part.<br>
In light of the above-mentioned problems, an object<br>
of the present invention is to provide an anti-adhesion<br>
membrane that has no toxicity to a living body, has<br>
flexibility allowing itself to fit an affected part as a<br>
hydrated gel, is uniformly crosslinked, and is immediately<br>
absorbed in a living body after maintaining its shape in<br>
the living body for a certain period of time.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
[0006]<br>
The present invention provides an anti-adhesion<br>
material, which comprises a thermally crosslinked gelatin<br>
film, and has a water content of 60 to 85% calculated by<br>
the following formula (1):<br>
water content (%) = [(Ws-Wd)/Ws] x 100 (%) (1),<br>
in the formula (1), Ws representing a weight (wet weight)<br>
of the anti-adhesion material immersed in a phosphate<br>
buffered saline solution at a temperature of 25°C for one<br>
hour, and Wd representing a weight (dry weight) of the<br>
anti-adhesion material dried completely using a vacuum<br>
drying apparatus.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
in detail.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present inventors has conducted further studies<br>
and completed the present invention with the following<br>
findings. That is, a thermally crosslinked gelatin film is<br>
more uniformly crosslinked than an ultraviolet-crosslinked<br>
gelatin film, and also produces no highly toxic substance<br>
having a low molecular weight, unlike the case of a method<br>
using a chemical crosslinking agent. Patent Documents 6<br><br>
and the like contain reference of thermal crosslinking of<br>
gelatin but no detailed description of a degree of<br>
crosslinking or a method for crosslinking required to<br>
obtain sufficient performance as an anti-adhesion material.<br>
[0008]<br>
The anti-adhesion material of the present invention<br>
comprises a thermally crosslinked gelatin film.<br>
A material for the gelatin film is not particularly<br>
limited, and examples thereof include a gelatin derived<br>
from a bone, a tendon, skin and the like from bovine, swine,<br>
chicken, salmon and the like.<br>
The preferable lower limit of a weight-average<br>
molecular weight, measured by GPC, of gelatin to be used as<br>
the material for the gelatin film is 100,000, and the<br>
preferable upper limit thereof is 300,000. Gelatin having<br>
a weight-average molecular weight of less than 100,000<br>
causes a lowered tensile strength of the obtained anti-<br>
adhesion material of the present invention. On the other<br>
hand, the upper limit thereof is defined as 300,000, based<br>
on a property of gelatin that never has a weight-average<br>
molecular weight of more than 300,000. Here, the more<br>
preferable lower limit is 150,000 and the more preferable<br>
upper limit is 300,000.<br>
[0009]<br>
The preferable lower limit of a jelly strength of the<br>
gelatin to be used as the material for the gelatin film is<br>
150 g, and the preferable upper limit thereof is 350 g.<br>
The reason can be explained as follows. Gelatin having a<br>
jelly strength of less than 150 g possibly results in the<br>
anti-adhesion material of the present invention having a<br>
larger deformation ratio or a lower tensile strength. In<br>
addition, production of gelatin having a jelly strength of<br>
more than 350 g is attended with difficulties. The more<br>
preferable lower limit is 250 g, and the more preferable<br>
upper limit is 350 g.<br><br>
Here, in this description, the jelly strength refers<br>
to a jelly strength defined in JIS K 6503-2001, and is<br>
measured by load required for a 4 mm depression of the<br>
surface of a jelly by a plunger having a diameter of 12.7<br>
mm at a speed of 1 mm/s, the jelly being prepared by<br>
cooling a 6.67% by weight gelatin solution for 17 hours at<br>
a temperature of 10°C.<br>
[0010]<br>
As the gelatin to be used as a material of the<br>
gelatin film, alkali treated gelatin is preferably used due<br>
to the significantly low endotoxin content and the<br>
excellent safety, and specific examples thereof include<br>
alkali treated gelatin derived from cattle and alkali<br>
treated gelatin derived from swine produced by Nippi,<br>
Incorporated, and the like.<br>
[0011]<br>
Into the gelatin to be used as a material of the<br>
gelatin film, for example, glycerin, polyethylene glycol,<br>
hyaluronic acid and the like may be added in an amount not<br>
inhibiting the purpose of the present invention, in order<br>
to allow the film to have flexibility. In addition, a<br>
conventionally well-known additive such as an antimicrobial<br>
agent and an anti-inflammatory agent may be added.<br>
[0012]<br>
The gelatin film can be obtained as follows: a<br>
gelatin solution is prepared by dissolving the raw gelatin<br>
in a suitable solvent, casted onto a water-repellent glass<br>
plate or a water-repellent release sheet such as a sheet<br>
(tray) made of polystyrene and a sheet (tray) made of<br>
fluorine resin, and then dried.<br>
That is, first, the raw gelatin is dissolved in a<br>
solvent under heating. As the above-mentioned solvent, for<br>
example, distilled water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the<br>
like, or a mixed solution thereof may be used. Out of<br>
these, distilled water is preferably used in terms of easy<br><br>
handling.<br>
Although an amount of the gelatin to be added is not<br>
particularly limited, the preferable lower limit thereof is<br>
0.1 g with respect to 100 mL of the solvent, and the<br>
preferable upper limit thereof is 50 g. Addition of less<br>
than 0.1 g of the gelatin may cause difficulties in forming<br>
thereof into a film. Addition of more then 50 g of the<br>
gelatin may cause difficulties in uniform casting thereof<br>
due to the high viscosity. The more preferable lower limit<br>
is 1 g, and the more preferable upper limit is 30 g.<br>
Although a temperature for dissolving the gelatin is<br>
not particularly limited, the preferable lower limit<br>
thereof is 30°C, and the preferable upper limit thereof is<br>
70°C. Dissolution of the gelatin at a temperature of less<br>
than 30°C may require a longer time. Dissolution of the<br>
gelatin at a temperature of more than 70°C may cause<br>
degradation and a lowering in molecular weight of the<br>
gelatin, leading to a decrease in the jelly strength. The<br>
more preferable lower limit is 40°C, and the more<br>
preferable upper limit is 60°C.<br>
[0013]<br>
A non-crosslinked gelatin film can be produced by<br>
casting the obtained solution containing the dissolved<br>
gelatin into a petri dish made of polystyrene or fluorine<br>
resin, and the like, and drying the solution.<br>
A method employed for the above-mentioned drying<br>
process is not particularly limited, and for example, air<br>
drying, drying by heating, drying under a reduced pressure<br>
(vacuum drying), forced exhaust drying, forced circulating<br>
convection and the like may be used.<br>
The preferable lower limit of a temperature employed<br>
in the above-mentioned drying process is -40°C, and the<br>
preferable upper limit thereof is 60°C. Drying of the<br>
gelatin film at a temperature of less than -40°C may<br>
require an excessively long time. Drying of the gelatin<br><br>
film at a temperature of more than 60°C causes degradation<br>
and a lowering in molecular weight of the gelatin. The<br>
more preferable lower limit is 0°C, and the more preferable<br>
upper limit is 40°C.<br>
[0014]<br>
The above-mentioned series of the production<br>
processes of the gelatin film are preferably carried out<br>
under aseptic conditions, for example, in a clean bench or<br>
a clean room. This is because the gelatin film should be<br>
prevented from occurring contamination of bacterial<br>
proliferation during operation. For this reason, a<br>
production apparatus to be used is preferably sterilized,<br>
for example, by an autoclave, EOG (ethylene oxide gas), dry<br>
heat, electron rays and the like. Moreover, the gelatin<br>
solution is also preferably sterilized, for example, by a<br>
conventionally well-known filter filtration sterilization,<br>
before used in the above-mentioned processes.<br>
[0015]<br>
The gelatin film obtained as described above is<br>
thermal-crosslinked.<br>
Thermal crosslinking allows the gelatin film to be<br>
more uniformly crosslinked than ultraviolet-crosslinking,<br>
and also produces no highly toxic substance having a low<br>
molecular weight, unlike the case of a method using a<br>
chemical crosslinking agent.<br>
[0016]<br>
Although a method employed for the above-mentioned<br>
thermal crosslinking process is not particularly limited,<br>
the film is preferably heated uniformly from the both faces<br>
thereof. Heating from the both faces enables the gelatin<br>
film to have a shape uniformly crosslinked even in the<br>
thickness direction.<br>
Heating is preferably carried out under a reduced<br>
pressure of 1 Torr or less. The reduced pressure enables<br>
suppression of thermal decomposition of the gelatin caused<br><br>
by heating.<br>
[0017]<br>
As a method employed for the above-mentioned thermal<br>
crosslinking process of the gelatin film, the preferable<br>
method is that the non-crosslinked gelatin film sandwiched<br>
between two sheets having the same thermal conductivity is<br>
heated under a reduced pressure. A method of this kind<br>
allows heat to be uniformly conducted to the non-<br>
crosslinked gelatin film through the two sheets, resulting<br>
in a uniform crosslinked shape of the gelatin film in both<br>
of the thickness direction and the plane direction.<br>
The method for producing an anti-adhesion material<br>
which comprises a step of thermal-crosslinking including<br>
heating under a reduced pressure with a non-crosslinked<br>
gelatin film sandwiched between two sheets having the same<br>
thermal conductivity is also one aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0018]<br>
Here, in case of carrying out thermal crosslinking<br>
simultaneously on a large number of non-crosslinked gelatin<br>
films, the gelatin films and the sheets having the same<br>
thermal conductivity needs to be laminated alternately to<br>
form a shape in which each of the gelatin film is<br>
sandwiched between the above-mentioned two sheets. However,<br>
a large number of laminated sheets may cause nonuniform<br>
heat distribution between a peripheral part and a central<br>
part of a laminated part. That is, thermal conduction may<br>
vary according to a distance from a heat source. In this<br>
case, insertion of materials having an excellent thermal<br>
conductivity such as an aluminum plate at a suitable<br>
interval allows uniform thermal conduction, resulting in<br>
prevention of nonuniformity of crosslinking in lot.<br>
Accordingly, a more uniformly thermally crosslinking can be<br>
carried out by carrying out thermal-crosslinking treatment<br>
with control of thermal conductivity using a combination of<br><br>
sheets each having a different thermal conductivity.<br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a preferable<br>
embodiment in which thermal crosslinking is simultaneously<br>
carried out on a large number non-crosslinked gelatin films.<br>
In Fig. 1, in a vacuum dryer 1, non-crosslinked gelatin<br>
films 2 and fluorine resin sheets 3 are alternately<br>
laminated in such a manner that the gelatin film 2 is<br>
sandwiched between the two fluorine resin sheets 3.<br>
Moreover, an aluminum plate 4 is disposed on every five<br>
sheets of the fluorine resin sheets 3 to allow heat to be<br>
uniformly conducted as a whole.<br>
The method for producing an anti-adhesion material,<br>
which comprises a step of carrying out thermal-crosslinking<br>
treatment with control of thermal conductivity using a<br>
combination of sheets each having a different thermal<br>
conductivity, is also one aspect of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, insertion of a sheet-shaped heat source<br>
is also one aspect of the present invention. The above-<br>
mentioned method allows more uniform thermal crosslinking.<br>
[0020]<br>
As the sheet-shaped heat source, examples thereof<br>
include a silicone rubber heater comprising a combination<br>
of a temperature controller and glass fiber reinforced<br>
silicone rubber sheets holding therebetween an electric<br>
heating nickel chrome, a silicone sheet heater, a metal<br>
heater and the like.<br>
Use of these sheet-shaped heat sources as they are,<br>
uses of them alternately laminated with the above-mentioned<br>
aluminum plates, or use of the sheet-shaped heat source<br>
sandwiched between the aluminum plates allows the whole<br>
face of the gelatin film to be heated more uniformly.<br>
[0021]<br>
The above-mentioned thermal crosslinking process is<br>
carried out to obtain the water content calculated by the<br><br>
following formula (1) of 60 to 85%. The water content can<br>
be used as an indicator reflecting a degree of crosslinking,<br>
and a low water content indicates a high degree of<br>
crosslinking.<br>
Water content (%) = [(Ws-Wd)/Ws] x 100 (%) (1)<br>
In the formula (1), Ws representing a weight (wet<br>
weight) of the anti-adhesion material immersed in a<br>
phosphate buffered saline solution at a temperature of 25°C<br>
for one hour, and Wd representing a weight (dry weight) of<br>
the anti-adhesion material dried completely using a vacuum<br>
drying apparatus.<br>
[0022]<br>
The anti-adhesion material having a water content of<br>
less than 60% has the rubber-like elasticity and an<br>
excellent shape retention property, but is slowly degraded<br>
upon disposed in a living body, possibly resulting in<br>
lowered performance for prevention of an adhesion. The<br>
anti-adhesion material having a water content of more than<br>
85% has a lowered shape retention property, and is quickly<br>
degraded upon disposed in a living body, resulting in loss<br>
of the shape at an early stage. The preferable lower limit<br>
is 65%, and the preferable upper limit is 80%.<br>
In order to obtain an anti-adhesion material having<br>
the water content within this range, conditions for thermal<br>
crosslinking are preferably suitably set approximately as<br>
follows: under a reduced pressure (1 Torr); at a<br>
temperature of 120 to 170°C; and for 30 minutes to 72 hours.<br>
Generally, heat treatment at a high temperature and<br>
heat treatment for a longer time produce a lot of<br>
crosslinking shapes leading to a high degree of<br>
crosslinking. A high degree of crosslinking indicates a<br>
low water content.<br>
Therefore, in order to obtain desired quality,<br>
conditions are suitably set to carry out thermal<br>
crosslinking. Thermal crosslinking at a lower temperature<br><br>
requires a longer time for crosslinking. On the other hand,<br>
thermal crosslinking at a higher temperature tends to cause<br>
a fragility of the film, thus leading to increased<br>
possibility of fracture in the film.<br>
One example of the more preferable conditions for<br>
thermal crosslinking to obtain the anti-adhesion material<br>
of the present invention is given as follows: at a<br>
temperature of 120 to 150°C; and for 5 to 30 hours.<br>
[0023]<br>
The preferable lower limit of a tensile strength of<br>
the anti-adhesion membrane of the present invention is 1 N,<br>
measured by a method according to JIS L 1912-1997 after<br>
immersion of a sample having a width of 1 cm in a phosphate<br>
buffered saline solution at a temperature of 25°C for one<br>
hour. Practically, an anti-adhesion membrane having a<br>
tensile strength of less than 1 N possibly causes<br>
difficulties in use. Although the upper limit is not<br>
particularly limited, it is difficult to obtain an anti-<br>
adhesion membrane having a tensile strength of more than 10<br>
N. Although a higher degree of crosslinking leads to a<br>
higher strength, an excessively high degree of crosslinking<br>
leads to fragility, resulting in lowering in a degree of<br>
elongation and strength. Moreover, since a lower degree of<br>
crosslinking leads to a lower strength, before sufficiently<br>
being elongated, fracture takes place in an anti-adhesion<br>
membrane.<br>
[0024]<br>
In the anti-adhesion membrane of the present<br>
invention, the preferable lower limit of a deformation<br>
ratio calculated by the following formula (2) is 95%, and<br>
the preferable upper limit thereof is 120%. The<br>
deformation ratio can be used as an indicator reflecting<br>
operationality in use. A deformation ratio deviating more<br>
distantly from 100% indicates more negative handling.<br>
Deformation ratio (%) = (Ss/Sd) x 100 (%) (2)<br><br>
In the formula (2), Ss representing an area of the<br>
anti-adhesion material immersed in the phosphate buffered<br>
saline solution at a temperature of 25°C for one hour, and<br>
Sd representing an area of the anti-adhesion material<br>
before the immersion. An anti-adhesion material having the<br>
deformation ratio of less than 95 % fails to maintain an<br>
area required to cover an affected part. An anti-adhesion<br>
material having the deformation ratio of more than 120 %<br>
may cause difficulties in operation. (Especially an anti-<br>
adhesion material containing a reinforcing material may<br>
cause difficulties to handle with such as curling up.) The<br>
more preferable lower limit is 100%, and the more<br>
preferable upper limit is 110%.<br>
Here, a high degree of crosslinking leads to a low<br>
deformation ratio.<br>
[0025]<br>
The anti-adhesion membrane of the present invention<br>
may be further reinforced by a reinforcing material made of<br>
a bioabsorbable polymer. Since the reinforcing material<br>
made of a bioabsorbable polymer is biodegraded and absorbed<br>
in a living body, use of a reinforcing material of this<br>
kind for reinforcing the anti-adhesion membrane of the<br>
present invention does not need re-operation and the like,<br>
and allows the anti-adhesion membrane to have a sufficient<br>
strength for preventing itself from damaging due to suture<br>
and the like.<br>
[0026]<br>
Although the bioabsorbable polymer is not<br>
particularly limited, polylactic acid, lactic acid-<br>
caprolactone copolymer, polyglycolic acid and the like are<br>
suitably used, owing to the suitable strength and<br>
degradation.<br>
[0027]<br>
An embodiment of the reinforcing material is not<br>
particularly limited, and examples thereof include a<br><br>
nonwoven fabric, a textile fabric, a knitted fabric, a<br>
braided rope, a film and the like. In terms of difficulty<br>
in being frayed when being fixed by a suture, a long-staple<br>
nonwoven fabric, a gause fabric, a warp knitted fabric and<br>
the like are suitably used.<br>
[0028]<br>
Hydrophilization treatment may be carried out on the<br>
surface of the reinforcing material. The hydrophilized<br>
surface of the reinforcing material is allowed to more<br>
firmly contact the gelatin film, resulting in less<br>
possibility of detachment of the reinforcing material from<br>
the gelatin film. The above-mentioned hydrophilization<br>
treatment is not particularly limited, and examples thereof<br>
include plasma treatment, glow discharge treatment, corona<br>
discharge treatment, ozonization, surface graft treatment,<br>
coating treatment, chemical treatment, ultraviolet-rays<br>
irradiation treatment and the like.<br>
[0029]<br>
Although an embodiment of the reinforcement by the<br>
reinforcing material is not particularly limited, for<br>
example, preferable examples thereof include an embodiment<br>
in which the reinforcing material is disposed in the<br>
surface and/or the inside of the gelatin film and united<br>
together.<br>
Moreover, a part to be reinforced is not particularly<br>
limited, the whole gelatin film may be reinforced, or only<br>
a part to be sutured and the like may be reinforced.<br>
[0030]<br>
A method for reinforcing by the reinforcing material<br>
is not particularly limited, and examples thereof are given<br>
as follows: a method in which the reinforcing material is<br>
immersed in the gelatin solution casted into a petri dish<br>
and the like, and the obtained reinforcing material<br>
containing the gelatin solution inside thereof was dried<br>
(first method); a method in which the gelatin solution<br><br>
casted into a perti dish and the like is allowed to<br>
gelatinize, and the reinforcing material is placed on the<br>
gelatin immediately before completion of the gelatinization<br>
and then dried after the completion of the gelatinization<br>
(second method); a method in which a complex of the<br>
reinforcing material and the gelatin film united together<br>
in the second method is immersed in the gelatin solution<br>
with the reinforcing material facing the gelatin solution<br>
(third method); a method in which two glass plates are<br>
preliminarily disposed facing each other to obtain an anti-<br>
adhesion membrane having a predetermined thickness, and<br>
allowed to hold a reinforcing material having a desired<br>
shape therebetween, and then the gelatin solution is casted<br>
between the glass plates, and dried after cooled for<br>
gelatinization (forth method); and the like.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0031]<br>
Since the anti-adhesion material of the present<br>
invention comprises a gelatin film that is thermally-<br>
crosslinked to have a certain water content, the anti-<br>
adhesion material has a uniformly degree of crosslinking as<br>
a whole. In addition, compared with an anti-adhesion<br>
material comprising an ultraviolet-crosslinked gelatin film,<br>
the anti-adhesion material of the present invention has a<br>
higher strength, and also a more excellent shape stability<br>
in a living body. Furthermore, compared with an anti-<br>
adhesion material comprising a gelatin film crosslinked<br>
using a chemical crosslinking agent, the anti-adhesion<br>
material of the present invention advantageously have no<br>
possibility of release of a toxic substance having a low<br>
molecular weight.<br>
Particularly, the anti-adhesion material of the<br>
present invention is suitably used for preventing an<br>
adhesion of pericardium. The anti-adhesion material for a<br><br>
pericardium comprising the anti-adhesion material of the<br>
present invention is also one aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention provides an anti-adhesion<br>
membrane that has no toxicity to a living body, has<br>
flexibility allowing itself to fit an affected part as a<br>
hydrated gel, is uniformly crosslinked, and is immediately<br>
absorbed in a living body after maintaining its shape in<br>
the living body for a certain period of time.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0032]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
in more detail by way of Examples, but the present<br>
invention is not limited to these Examples.<br>
[0033]<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Gelatin (produced by Nippi, Inc., alkali treated<br>
product derived from swine, weight-average molecular<br>
weight: 132,000, jelly strength: 257 g) was dissolved in<br>
distilled water to obtain a solution containing 5% by<br>
weight of the gelatin. An amount of 13 mL of the obtained<br>
solution was casted into a petri dish (size: 14 cm x 10 cm)<br>
made of polystyrene resin, and air dried as it was to<br>
obtain a non-crosslinked gelatin film having a thickness of<br>
approximately 40 urn.<br>
A laminated body of the non-crosslinked gelatin films<br>
having a thickness of 160 urn was obtained by laminating<br>
four sheets of the non-crosslinked gelatin films. Each of<br>
the non-crosslinked gelatin films forming the laminated<br>
body of the non-crosslinked gelatin film was assigned one<br>
of numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 in a sequential order from the top.<br>
[0034]<br>
Fluorine resin sheets having a thickness of 1 mm were<br>
disposed on the both faces of the obtained laminated body<br><br>
of the non-crosslinked gelatin film. In addition, aluminum<br>
plates having a thickness of 3 mm were disposed on the both<br>
faces of the obtained laminated body, and the resulting<br>
laminated body was disposed on a shelf in a vacuum drying<br>
apparatus. In this state, thermal crosslinking was carried<br>
out under a pressure of 1 Torr or less at a temperature of<br>
135°C for 8 hours.<br>
[0035]<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
A laminated body of non-crosslinked gelatin film<br>
obtained by the same method as that of Example 1 was<br>
irradiated with ultraviolet rays from a face of a film 1<br>
for 10 hours at a strength of 0.25 mW/cm2 (15 W<br>
bactericidal lamp, distance: 50 cm) to carry out<br>
ultraviolet-crosslinking.<br>
[0036]<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
A laminated body of non-crosslinked gelatin film<br>
obtained by the same method as that of Example 1 was<br>
irradiated with ultraviolet rays from a face of a film 1 in<br>
the same method as that of Comparative Example 1.<br>
Subsequently, the laminated body is further irradiated with<br>
ultraviolet rays in the same method from a face of a film 4<br>
to carry out ultraviolet ray treatment on the both faces of<br>
the laminated body, (each one face: 10 hours, total<br>
irradiation: 20 hours)<br>
[0037]<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
The water content was measured based on the following<br>
method for each of four gelatin films forming the laminated<br>
body of the gelatin film after crosslinked. That is, each<br>
of the gelatin films was dried in a vacuum drying apparatus<br>
under a reduced pressure of 1 Torr or less at a temperature<br>
of 25°C for approximately 24 hours to measure the dry<br>
weight thereof. On the other hand, each of the gelatin<br><br>
film was immersed in a phosphate buffered saline solution<br>
having a temperature of 25°C for 1 hour to measure the wet<br>
weight.<br>
The water content was calculated by the above-<br>
mentioned formula (1) using the obtained dry weight and wet<br>
weight.<br>
Table 1 shows the results.<br>
[0038]<br><br>
[0039]<br>
Table 1 shows that the four gelatin films thermally<br>
crosslinked in Example 1 had almost the same water content.<br>
However, in Comparative Example 1 in which ultraviolet-<br>
crosslinking is carried out, the film located closer to the<br>
face that was not subjected to the direct irradiation with<br>
ultraviolet rays had a higher water content (that is, a low<br>
degree of crosslinking). Furthermore, in Comparative<br>
Example 2 in which ultraviolet-crosslinking is carried out,<br>
the films 2 and 3 had a higher water content (that is, a<br>
lower degree of crosslinking) than that of the films 1 and<br>
4 that were irradiated with ultraviolet rays. In both<br>
Comparative Examples, the obtained films were less<br>
uniformly crosslinked than those obtained by thermal<br>
crosslinking.<br>
The results show distribution of the water contents<br>
every 40 urn in the depth direction of the gelatin films<br>
when thermal crosslink was carried out on the non-<br><br>
crosslinked gelatin film having a thickness of<br>
approximately 160 µm or ultraviolet-crosslinking was<br>
carried out on only one face or the both faces of the non-<br>
crosslinked gelatin film having a thickness of<br>
approximately 160 µm. That is, thermal crosslinking allows<br>
the gelatin film to be more uniformly crosslinked than<br>
ultraviolet-crosslinking.<br>
[0040]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Gelatin (produced by Nippi, Inc., alkali treated<br>
product derived from swine, weight-average molecular<br>
weight: 191,000, jelly strength: 255 g) was dissolved in<br>
distilled water to obtain a solution containing 5% by<br>
weight of the gelatin. An amount of 50 mL of the obtained<br>
solution was casted into a petri dish (size: 14 cm x 10 cm)<br>
made of polystyrene resin, and air dried as it was. As a<br>
result, 20 sheets of non-crosslinked gelatin films having a<br>
thickness of approximately 160 µm were obtained.<br>
The non-crosslinked gelatin films were allowed to<br>
leave at rest in a manner shown in Fig. 1 in a vacuum<br>
drying apparatus. That is, gelatin films and fluorine<br>
resin sheets having a thickness of 1 mm were laminated<br>
alternately to form a shape in which the non-crosslinked<br>
gelatin film is sandwiched between two fluorine resin<br>
sheets without failure. Furthermore, an aluminum plate<br>
having a thickness of 3 mm was disposed on every five non-<br>
crosslinked gelatin films.<br>
Here, each of the non-crosslinked gelatin films was<br>
assigned one of numbers of 1, 2, 3 ... 20 in a sequential<br>
order from the bottom.<br>
In this state, thermal crosslinking was carried out<br>
under a pressure of 1 Torr or less at a temperature of<br>
135°C for 8 hours.<br>
[0041]<br>
(Evaluation)<br><br>
The water content was measured based on the above-<br>
mentioned method for each of four gelatin films 3, 8, 13,<br>
18 selected from the 20 sheets of the crosslinked gelatin<br>
films.<br>
Table 2 shows the results.<br>
[0042]<br><br>
[0043]<br>
Table 2 shows that the obtained films had almost the<br>
same water content, irrespective of positions of the films<br>
disposed in a vacuum drying apparatus.<br>
[0044]<br>
(Example 3)<br>
Gelatin (produced by Nippi, Inc., alkali treated<br>
product derived from swine, weight-average molecular<br>
weight: 132,000, jelly strength: 257 g) was dissolved in<br>
distilled water to obtain a solution containing 5% by<br>
weight of the gelatin. An amount of 50 mL of the obtained<br>
solution was casted into a petri dish (size: 14 cm x 10 cm)<br>
made of polystyrene resin, and air dried as it was to<br>
obtain a non-crosslinked gelatin film having a thickness of<br>
approximately 160 µm.<br>
Fluorine resin sheets having a thickness of 1 mm were<br>
disposed on the both faces of the obtained laminated body<br>
of the non-crosslinked gelatin film. In addition, aluminum<br>
plates having a thickness of 3 mm were disposed on the both<br>
faces of the obtained laminated body, and the resulting<br>
laminated body was disposed on a shelf in a vacuum drying<br><br>
apparatus. In this state, thermal crosslinking was carried<br>
out under a pressure of 1 Torr or less at a temperature of<br>
135°C for 8 hours.<br>
[0045]<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
A non-crosslinked gelatin film having a thickness of<br>
approximately 160 µm was produced by the same method as<br>
that of Example 3. The obtained non-crosslinked gelatin<br>
film was irradiated with ultraviolet rays for 10 hours on<br>
each faces at a strength of 0.25 mW/cm2 (15 W bactericidal<br>
lamp, distance: 50 cm) to carry out ultraviolet-<br>
crosslinking on the both faces.<br>
[0046]<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
The evaluation was carried out based on the following<br>
method for each of the anti-adhesion materials produced in<br>
Example 3 and Comparative Example 3.<br>
Table 3 shows the results.<br>
[0047]<br>
(1)	Measurement of tensile strength<br>
The measurement was carried out based on a method<br>
according to JIS L 1912-1997. That is, a sample was cut<br>
into a size having a width of 1 cm and a length of 3 cm,<br>
and immersed in a phosphate buffered saline solution having<br>
a temperature of 25°C for 1 hour. Subsequently, after<br>
wiping off excessive water on the surface, the sample was<br>
set in a tensile test machine (Instron 4302 produced by<br>
Instron, Co., Ltd.) with a distance between clamps of 1 cm,<br>
and pulled at a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min to obtain a<br>
stress as the tensile strength upon fracture thereof.<br>
[0048]<br>
(2)	Measurement of deformation ratio<br>
A sample is cut into a size of a width of approximate<br>
1 cm and a length of approximate 3 cm, and the sides of the<br>
sample were accurately measured using a slide caliper to<br><br>
calculate an area Sd. After the sample was immersed in a<br>
phosphate buffered saline solution having a temperature of<br>
25°C for 1 hour, excessive water on the surface is wiped<br>
off, and the sides were again measured accurately using a<br>
slide caliper to calculate an area Ss.<br>
The deformation ratio was calculated by the above-<br>
mentioned formula (2).<br>
[0049]<br>
(3)	Measurement of water content<br>
The same method as that of Example 1 was employed for<br>
the measurement.<br>
[0050]<br>
(4)	Evaluation of animal experiment<br>
Each of the obtained anti-adhesion materials was cut<br>
into a size of 1 cm x 1.5 cm, and then implanted in an<br>
abdominal cavity of a wistar rat (five-week age). The<br>
evaluation was carried out based on visual observation of<br>
states of the anti-adhesion materials upon incision after a<br>
period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 weeks according to the<br>
following standard.<br>
O: Anti-adhesion material maintained its shape till<br>
four weeks, and disappeared completely in six weeks.<br>
X: Anti-adhesion material lost its shape and almost<br>
disappeared in three weeks.<br>
[0051]<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0052]<br>
The present invention provides an anti-adhesion<br><br>
membrane that has no toxicity to a living body, has<br>
flexibility allowing itself to fit an affected part as a<br>
hydrated gel, is uniformly crosslinked, and is immediately<br>
absorbed in a living body after maintaining its shape in<br>
the living body for a certain period of time.<br>
