FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the field of development of creativity of children through the use of a specially designed device having a peculiar shape, with Geometric shapes of circle, square, triangle and cone in-built in it, titled "Geometric Drawing Tool".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The absence of such an innovative drawing tool having a unique shape with Geometric Shapes, in-built in it was felt and the same has led to this invention.<br>
The Patent US2570806 is for a drawing kit consisting of a set of stencils. The drawbacks of this kit are :- (1) only limited Geometric Shapes and designs can be created. (2) Different Stencils are to be used by children and older people (3). All stencils are having Geometrical Shapes. (4) Aesthetic Art Works cannot be created with this kit.<br>
My invention relates to a single drawing tool having a peculiar shape with Geometric Shapes of circle, square, triangle and cone in-built in it, for creating innumerable Geometric shapes, Abstact Designs and Aesthetic Art works, which is an inventive step with improvements and novelty.<br>
This invention relates to a Geometric Drawing Tool for developing creativity, brain-muscle co-ordination, concentration by making interesting and aesthetic art works. Notably the device proposed herein is useful and beneficial to children for enhancement of creativity, brain-muscle co-ordination, concentration and improving handwriting, in the process of using the same, for creating innumerable aesthetic art works.<br>
The device proposed herein is a geometric configuration specially designed for creating Geometric features, such as straight lines, curves, circles, squares, triangles etc. All art works are created using one or more of these lines, curves and basic shapes. Hence this device helps a novice to become an artist in a short period. Regular use of this device for creating various designs will help the user in enhancing his/her creativity, brain-muscle coordination and concentration.<br>
Of its many advantages, the one which is noteworthy, is the improvement of the handwriting of the regular user.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a device for developing creativity, concentration, brain-muscle coordination, improving handwriting and releasing stress, by making aesthetic art works.<br>
The device itself has semi-circular shapes at both ends and it narrows down from the top to the bottom portion. The device has the Geometric Shapes of circle, square, triangle and cone in-built in it. The drawing sheet-1 shows the actual shape and dimentions of the device which is piculiar and is a novelty.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
Regular use of this device will help children in developing creativity, concentration, brain-muscle co-ordination, and improving handwriting.<br>
Managers and Executives working in stressful environments will be highly benefited, if they take 15 minutes break and relax doing some art work with this device, after working continuously for a few hours, since divertion of the mind to a pleasing activity of this nature, will avoid the stress level reaching the peak value.<br>
The healing power of art has already been recognised by the medical world, since creating art works involves total absorption and is considered equivalent to meditation, leading to a healthy mind and body. Hence this innovative device could be introduced to patients during their convalescence to hasten up recuperation.<br>
Vigorous thinking process is involved while creating a new design. Thinking process causes physical changes and alterations of the cell chemistry, body temperature, blood pressure, mental stress etc. While using this device for art works, the user is deeply involved in thinking process. This in turn helps in releasing stress and getting back to normal.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Drawing Sheet-I shows the Geometric Drawing Tool having semi-circular shapes at the top end (a) and bottom end (b), narrowing down from tope to bottom portion on both sides (c and d), with Geometric Shapes of circle (e), square (f), triangle (g) and cone (h) in-built in it. Drawing sheet-2, shows some of the designs created by using this Geometric Drawing Tool.<br>
The designs, shapes and art works shown in the drawings and the books "Creative Activity with Geometric Brain Activator (Part-I and Part-ll) are only a few. Innumerable similar designs, shapes and art works can be created with this innovative device titled Geometric Drawing Tool.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The invention is an innovative device as described above and can be manufactured out of plastic, metal or alloys or any material which can be used for moulding. Samples of the said device, are enclosed with the books "Creative Activity with Geometric Brain Activator (Part-I and Part-ll) for your scrutiny.<br>
HOW TO USE THE DEVICE FOR CREATING DESIGNS / ART WORKS<br>
For creating designs the user of this device should first visualise any design, which is to be created. Then the device should be kept on a sheet of paper. A right handed person should hold the device firmly with this left hand and left handed person with his right hand. The user should draw along the edges of the device with a pencil, sketch pen or any other writing device and create part of the design. The user should then move the<br><br>
device to the desired angle and should continue drawing along ttie outer edges of the device or inner edges of the slots provided. Only a part of the design can be created at one position of the device. The position of the device should be changed by the user, according to the shape to be created for completing the design and the user should keep on drawing along the outer edges of the device or inner edges of square, circular or triangular slots provided. Innumerable designs, shapes and figures can be created by using this device. As the skill of the user improves innumerable shapes and designs, which can be easily created by using this device come into his imagination.<br>
NOVELTIES OF THE INVENTION<br>
This is a Geometric Drawing Tool having a peculiar shape with Geometric shapes of circle, square, triangle and cone in-built in it<br>
Regular use of this device will help children in developing creativity, concentration, brain-muscle co-ordination and improving handwriting.<br>
Managers and Executives working in stressful environments will be highly benefited, if they take 15 minutes break and relax doing some art work with this device, after working continuously for a few hours, since divertion of the mind to a pleasing activity of this nature, will avoid the stress level reaching the peak value.<br>
The healing power of art has already been recognised by the medical world, since creating art works involves total absorption and is considered equivalent to meditation, leading to a healthy mind and body. Hence this innovative device could be introduced to patients during their convalescence to hasten up recuperation.<br>
Vigorous thinking process is involved while creating a new design. Thinking process causes physical changes and alterations of the cell chemistry, body temperature, blood pressure, mental stress etc. While using this device for art works, the user is deeply involved in thinking process. This in turn helps in releasing stress and getting back to normal.<br>
Recognition of the device by the Montessori Training and Research Centre affiliated to Association Montessori Internationale, Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>
The device has been tried out by the Montessori Training and Research Centre, affiliated to Association Montessori Internationale, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and found to be very useful for children.<br>
