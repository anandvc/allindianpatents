THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A NOVEL BENZIMIDAZOLE COMPOUND!"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
This invention relates to novel benzimidazole derivatives that are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of abnormal cell growth in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
It is known that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene (i.e., a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumor cells). Many oncogenes encode proteins that are aberrant tyrosine kinases capable of causing cell transformation. Alternatively, the overexpression of a normal proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase may also result in proliferative disorders, sometimes resulting in a malignant phenotype.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Other receptor tyrosine kinases include c-erbB-2, c-met, tie-2, PDGFr, FGFr, and VEGFR. It is known that such kinases are frequently aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer. It has also been shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which possesses tyrosine kinase activity, is mutated and/or overexpressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid tumors.<br>
Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells. For example, erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively attenuates the growth in athymic nude mice of a transplanted human mammary carcinoma that expresses epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma that does not express the EGF receptor. Thus, the compounds of the present invention, which are selective inhibitors of certain receptor tyrosine kinases, in particular PDGFr, are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, in particular cancer, in mammals,"<br>
Various other compounds, such as styrene derivatives, have also been shown to possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. More recently, five European patent publication's, namely EP 0 566 226 A1 (published October 20, 1993), EP 0 602 851 A1 (published June 22, 1994), EP 0 635 507 A1 (published January 25,1995), EP 0 635 498 A1 (published January 25, 1995), and EP 0 520 722 A1 (published December 30,1992), refer to certain bicyclic derivatives,<br><br>
in particular quinazoline derivatives, as possessing anti-cancer properties that result from their tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Also, World Patent Application WO 92/20642 (published November 26, 1992), refers to certain bis-mono and bicyclic aryl and heteroaryl compounds as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful in inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation. World Patent Applications WO96/16960 (published June 6, 1996), WO 96/09294 (published March 6, 1996), WO 97/30034 (published August 21, 1997), WO 98/02434 (published January 22, 1998), WO 98/02437 (published January 22, 1998), and WO 98/02438 (published January 22, 1998), also refer to.substituted bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful for the same purpose.<br>

Since a single compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moieties, the compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.<br>
Those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts and, particularly, the calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium salts of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
In the compounds of formula 1, where terms such as (CR4R5)m or (CR4R5), are used, R4 and R5 may vary with each iteration of m or t above 1. For instance, where m or t is 2, the terms (CR4R5)m or (CR4RSX may equal -CH2CH2-, or -CH(CH3)C(CH2CH3)(CH2CH2CH3)-, or any number of similar moieties falling within the scope of the definitions of R4 and R5.<br>
Certain compounds of formula 1 may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of formula 1, and mixtures thereof, are considered to be within the scope of the invention. With respect to the compounds of formula 1, the invention includes the use of a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, or mixtures thereof. The compounds of formula 1 may also exist as tautomers. This invention relates to the use of all such tautomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
The subject invention also includes isotopically-labelled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula 1, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180, 170, 31P, ^P, ^S, iaF, and xCl, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford- certain therapeutic advantages<br><br>
resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo.-half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of formula 1 of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.<br>
This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing and methods of treating proliferative disorders, or abnormal cell growth, by administering prodrugs of compounds of the formula 1.   Compounds of formula 1 having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs.   Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of formula 1. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, free carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyl esters.   Free hydroxy groups may be derivatized using groups including but not limited to hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in Advanced Drug      Delivery Reviews, 1996, 19, 115.  Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996,   39,   10.      Free   amines   can   also   be  derivatized   as   amides,   sulfonamides   or phosphonamides.

In stepl of scheme 8, compound of the formula 8 is reacted with an electrophile RY, where Y is a mesylate, tosylate, bromide, chloride or iodide, and a base, such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or cesium carbonate, in a solvent, such as DMF, THF, DMSO or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, at a temperature ranging from -78°C to 65°C, to give compound of the the formula 29. Compounds of formula 29 may have protecting groups, such as R11, R10 or R9 = OMe, that can be removed by standard conditions as discussed in "Protective Groups for Organic Synthesis". For example, R11, R10 or R9 = OMe can be transformed to R11, R10 or R9 = OH by treating with borontribromide in an organic solvent such as DCM at a temperature ranging from -78°C to 45°C, preferably at ambient temperature for 1 to 24 hours.<br>
Also outlined in scheme 1 in step 1, compound of the formula 9 is reacted with carbon monoxide, at a pressure range of atmospheric to 50 psi, preferably 50 psi, in the presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine, under palladium catalysis, such as palladium acetate, with a ligand, such as 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, in a solvent, such as DMF, in the presence of methanol to give compound of the formula 30. In step 2, compound of the formula 30 is reacted with a preformed complex of an amine HNR3R4 (or its hydrochloride salt) with trimethylaluminum in a solvent such as DCM or DCE at a temperature range of 0°C to reflux to give compound of the formula 31.

The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixtures into a diastereomric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and pure enantiomers are considered as part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formulas 1, 13, 15, 18, 19, 29, 31 that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often<br><br>
desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of formula 1,13,15,18,19,29, 31 from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceuticaliy unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.<br>
Those compounds of formula 1, 13, 15, 18, 19, 29, 31 that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceuticaliy acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of formula 1,13, 15,18,19,29,31. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure.    Alternatively, they may also be . prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product, i     Since a single compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moieties, the compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.<br>
The activity of the compounds of formula 1,13,15,18,19,29,31 may be determined by the following procedure.<br>

The in vitro activity of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting the PDGFβ       receptor may be determined by the following procedure.<br>
Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity may be measured using a recombinant enzyme in an assay that measures the ability of compounds to inhibit the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate, polyGluTyr (PGT, Sigma™, 4:1). The cytoplasmic domain of the human PDGF(3 receptor (amino acids 559-1106) (Ishikawa, F., et al. Nature 338: 557-562, 1989) is expressed in Sf9 insect cells as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein using the<br><br>
baculovirus expression system.  The protein is then purified from the lysates of these cells using glutathione agarose affinity columns.<br>
The enzyme assay is performed in 96-well plates that are coated with the PGT substrate (0.625 ng PGT per well). Test compounds are diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and then added to the PGT plates so that the final concentration of DMSO in the assay is 1.6% (v/v). The recombinant enzyme is diluted in phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 125 mM NaCI, 24 mM MgCI2). The reaction is initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 10 μM. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature with shaking, the reaction is aspirated, and the plates are washed with wash buffer (PBS-containing 0.1% Tween-20). The amount of phosphorylated PGT is quantitated by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-conjugated PY-54 antibody (Transduction Labs), developing with TMB peroxidase (TMB is 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine), and detection on a BioRad™ Microplate reader at 450 nM. Inhibition of the kinase enzymatic activity by the test compound is detected as a reduced absorbance, and the concentration of the compound that is required to inhibit the signal by 50% (under the circumstances of the assay) is reported as the IC50 value for the test compound.<br>

PMSF (phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride), 1 ng/ml pepstatin, 1 ng/ml leupeptin, 1 ng/ml aprotonin,<br>
2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate). The extent of phosphorylation of<br>
PDGFRp is measured using an ELISA assay.   The 96-well Protein A coated plates are<br>
blocked with Superblock (Pierce) and coated with 0.5 μg per well anti- PDGFRp P20 antibody<br>
(Santa Cruz, catalog number SC-339).<br><br>
Any unbound antibody is washed off the plates prior to addition of the cell lysate. After a 2 hour room temperature incubation of the lysates (50 ul) with the PDGFR0 antibody, the PDGFRp associated phosphotyrosine is quantitated by development with the HRP-conjugated PY-54 antibody and TMB, as described above. The ability of the compounds to inhibit the PDGF-BB stimulated autophosphorylation reaction by 50% under the conditions used, relative to PDGF-BB-stimulated controls, is reported as the IC50 value for the test compound. The compounds of the present invention, including the examples recited below, generally have IC50 values using the foregoing procedure falling within the following range: 1-1000 nM.<br>
