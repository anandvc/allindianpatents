PLATELET-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR COMPOSITIONS<br>
AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to the healing of bone and connective tissues.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Growth factors are proteins that bind to receptors on a cell surface, with the<br>
primary result of activating cellular proliferation and/or differentiation. Many growth<br>
factors are quite versatile, stimulating cellular division in numerous different cell<br>
types; while others are specific to a particular cell-type. Examples of growth factors<br>
include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insurin-like growth factors IGF-I and<br>
IT), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-/3), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and<br>
fibroblast growth factor (FGF). PDGF is a cationic, heat stable protein found in a<br>
variety of cell types, including the granules of circulating platelets, vascular smooth<br>
muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophage, and keratinocytes, and is known to<br>
stimulate in vitro protein synthesis and collagen production by fibroblasts. It is also<br>
known to act as an in vitro mitogen and chemotactic agent for fibroblasts, smooth<br>
muscle cells, osteoblasts, and glial cells.<br>
Recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB) has been shown to stimulate<br>
wound healing and bone regeneration in both animals and humans. It is approved in<br>
both the United States and Europe for human use in topical applications to accelerate<br>
healing of chronic diabetic foot sores. Recombinant hPDGF-BB has also been shown<br>
to be effective either singly or in combination with other growth factors for improving<br>
periodontal regeneration, i.e., regrowth of bone, cementum, and ligament around teeth<br>
(see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5124,316, incorporated herein by reference).<br>

WO 2006/044334                                                                                               PCT/US2005/036447<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
We have now demonstrated that a low dose of rhPDGF (~0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL)<br>
promotes repair of bone, periodontium, ligament, and cartilage. A low amount of<br>
rhPDGF can be adsorbed to /5-TCP, which can be implanted at the site of repair, such<br>
that the rhPDGF is released in vivo. Addition of rhPDGF to β-TCP has been shown to<br>
enhance osteoblast cell attachment and proliferation compared to untreated β-TCP.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention features a method for promoting bone,<br>
periodontium, ligament, or cartilage growth in a mammal, e.g., a human, by<br>
administering an implant material containing platelet-derived; growth factor (PDGF)<br>
at a concentration of less than about 1.0 mg/ml, such that the implant material<br>
promotes growth of the bone, periodontium, ligament, or cartilage. In an<br>
embodiment, the PDGF is administered in an amount of less than or equal to 0.3<br>
mg/ml. In another embodiment, the PDGF is administered in an amount in the range<br>
of about 0.1 to about 1.0 mg/ml. In several embodiments, the PDGF is administered<br>
in an amount of between about 0.2 to about 0.75 mg/ml, about 0.25 to about 0.6<br>
mg/ml, and about 0.25 to about 0.5 mg/ml. In an embodiment, the PDGF is<br>
administered in an amount of about 0.1 mg/ml, 0.3 mg/ml, or 1.0 mg/ml, preferably<br>
0.3 mg/mL. In another embodiment, the PDGF is either partially or substantially<br>
purified. In yet a further embodiment, the PDGF is isolated or purified from other<br>
contaminants. In a further embodiment, the PDGF is released from the implant<br>
material upon administration at an average rate of 0.3 mg/day. In another<br>
embodiment, the PDGF is released from the implant material upon administration at<br>
an average rate of 300 μg/day. In still further embodiments, the PDGF is released<br>
from the implant material at an average rate of less than 100 μg/day, less than 50<br>

WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
μg/day, less than 10 μg/day, or less than 1 μg/day. Preferably, the PDGF is delivered<br>
over a few days, e.g., 1, 2, 5,10,15, 20, or 25 days, or up to 28 days or more.<br>
A second aspect of the invention features a method for promoting bone,<br>
periodorrtium, ligament, or cartilage growth in a mammal, e.g., a human, by<br>
administering an implant material containing an amount of platelet-derived growth<br>
factor (PDGF) of less than about 1.0 mg/ml and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
such that the implant material promotes the growth of the bone, periodontium,<br>
ligament, or cartilage, and allowing the bone, periodontium, ligament, or cartilage to<br>
grow. Preferably, the PDGF is equal to or less than about 0.3 mg/ml. In an<br>
embodiment, the PDGF is administered in a range of about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/ml. In other<br>
embodiments, the amount of PDGF is about 0.1 mg/ml, 0.3 mg/ml, or 1.0 mg/ml,<br>
preferably 0.3'mg/mL. In another embodiment, the PDGF is either partially or<br>
substantially purified. In yet a further embodiment, the PDGF is isolated or purified<br>
from other contaminants. Prior to administering the implant material to the mammal,<br>
the method can additionally include the step of producing a surgical flap of skin to<br>
expose the bone, periodontium, ligament, or cartilage, and following the<br>
administration step, replacing the flap. In yet another embodiment, after producing<br>
the surgical flap, but prior to administering the implant material to the bone,<br>
periodontium, ligament, or cartilage, the method can additionally include the step of<br>
planing the bone or periodontium to remove organic matter from the bone or<br>
periodontium. In yet another embodiment, the method promotes the growth of<br>
damaged or diseased bone, periodontium, ligament, or cartilage. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the method promotes the growth of bone in locations where new bone<br>
formation is required as a result of surgical interventions, such as, e.g., tooth<br>
extraction, ridge augmentation, esthetic grafting, and sinus lift.<br>

PDGF in an amount in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/ml, more preferably 0.1 mg/ml, 0.3<br>
mg/ml, or 1.0 mg/ml, most preferably 0.3 mg/ml, or even less; than 0.1 mg/ml, with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance, e.g., a biocompatible binder, such asa<br>
natural or synthetic polymer (e.g., collagen, polyglycolic acid, and polylactic acid), a<br>
bone substituting agent (e.g., a calcium phosphate (e.g., tricalciurn phosphate or<br>
hydroxyapatite), calcium sulfate, or demineralized bone (e.g., demineralized freeze-<br>
dried cortical or cancellous bone), or a commercially available gel or liquid (i.e., a<br>
viscous or inert gel or liquid).<br>
In several embodiments, the carrier substance of the implant material is, or<br>
additionally includes, one or more biocompatible binders. A biocompatible binder is<br>
an agent that produces or promotes cohesion between the combined substances. Non-<br>
limiting examples of suitable biocompatible binders includepolymers selected from<br>
polysaccharides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, polypeptides, poly(a-hydroxy<br>
acids), poly(lactones), poly(amino acids), poly(anhydrides), poly(orthoesters),<br>
poly(anhydride-co-imides), poly(orthocarbonates), poly(a-hydroxy alkanoates),<br>
poly(dioxanones), poly(phosphoesters), polylactic acid, poly(L-lactide) (PLLA),<br>
poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA), polyglycolide (PGA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA),<br>

polycarboxylic acid, poly(allylamine hydrochloride), poly(diallyldimethylammonium<br>
chloride), poly(ethyleneimine), polypropylene fumarate, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene, polymethylmethacrylate, carbon fibers,<br>
poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(vinyl alcohol),<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(ethyloxazoline), poly(ethylene oxide)-co-poly(propylene<br>
oxide) block copolymers, poly(ethylene terephthalate)polyamide, and copolymers and<br>
mixtures thereof. Additional binders include alginic acid, arabic gum, guar gum,<br>
xantham gum, gelatin, chitin, chitosan, chitosan acetate, chitosan lactate, chondroitin<br>
sulfate, N,0-carboxymethyl chitosan, a dextran (e.g., a-cyclodextrin, /3-cyclodextrin,<br>
γ-cyclodextrin, or sodium dextran sulfate), fibrin glue, glycerol, hyaluronic acid,<br>
sodium hyaluronate, a cellulose (e.g., methylcellulose, carboxy methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, or hydroxyethyl cellulose), a glucosamine, a<br>
proteoglycan, a starch (e.g., hydroxyethyl starch or starch soluble), lactic acid, a<br>
pluronic, sodium glycerophosphate, collagen, glycogen, a keratin, silk, and<br>
derivatives and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the biocompatible binder is<br>
water-soluble. A water-soluble binder dissolves from the implant material shortly<br>
after its implantation in vivo, thereby introducing macroporosity into the implant<br>
material. This macroporosity increases the osteoconductivity of the implant material<br>
by enhancing the access and, consequently, the remodeling activity of the osteoclasts<br>
and osteoblasts at the implant site.<br>
The biocompatible binder may be added to the implant material in varying<br>
amounts and at a variety of stages during the preparation of the composition. Those<br>
of skill in the art will be able to determine the amount of binder and the method of<br>
inclusion required for a given application.<br>

In an embodiment, the carrier substance is or includes a liquid selected from<br>
water, a buffer, and a cell culture medium.  The liquid may be used in any pH range,<br>
but most often will be used in the range of pH 5.0 to pH 8.0. In an embodiment, the<br>
pH will be compatible with the prolonged stability and efficacy of the PDGF present<br>
in the implant material, or with the prolonged stability and efficacy of another desired<br>
biologically active agent. In most embodiments, the pH of the liquid will be in the<br>
range of pH 5.5 to pH 7.4. Suitable buffers include, but are not limited to, carbonates,<br>
phosphates (e.g., phosphate buffered saline), and organic buffers such as Tris,<br>
HEPES, and MOPS. Most often, the buffer will be selected for its biocompatibility<br>
with the host tissues and its compatibility with the biologically active agent. For most<br>
applications in which nucleic acids, peptides, or antibiotics are included in the implant<br>
material, a simple phosphate buffered saline will suffice.<br>
In another embodiment of all aspects of the invention, the carrier substance of<br>
the implant material is, or additionally includes, one or more bone substituting agents.<br>
A bone substituting agent is one that can be used to permanently or temporarily<br>
replace bone. Following implantation, the bone substituting agent can be retained by<br>
the body or it can be resorbed by the body and replaced with bone.   Exemplary bone<br>
substituting agent include, e.g., a calcium phosphate (e.g., tricalcium phosphate (e.g.,<br>
/3-TCP), hydroxyapatite, poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite, amorphous calcium<br>
phosphate, calcium metaphosphate, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, heptacalcium<br>
phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, calcium pyrophosphate, and<br>
octacalcium phosphate), calcium sulfate, or demineralized bone (e.g., demineralized<br>
freeze-dried cortical or cancellous bone)). In an embodiment, the carrier substance is<br>
bioresorbable. In another embodiment, the bone substituting; agent is provided as a<br>
matrix of micron- or submicron- sized particles, e.g., nano-sized particles. The<br>

particles can be in the range of about 100 /an to about 5000 fan. in size, more<br>
preferably in the range of about 200 μm to about 3000 μm, and most preferably in the<br>
range of about 250 μm to about 2000 μm, or the particles canibe in the range of about<br>
1 nm to about 1000 run, preferably less than about 500 nm, and more preferably less<br>
than about 250 nm. In another embodiment, the bone substituting agent has a porous<br>
composition. Porosity of the composition is a desirable characteristic as it facilitates<br>
cell migration and infiltration into the composition so that the; cells can secrete<br>
extracellular bone matrix. It also provides access for vascularization. Porosity also<br>
provides a high surface area for enhanced resorption and release of active substances,<br>
as well as increased cell-matrix interaction. Preferably, the composition has a<br>
porosity of greater than 40%, more preferably greater than 65%, and most preferably<br>
greater than 90%. The composition can be provided in a shape suitable for<br>
implantation (e.g., a sphere, a cylinder, or a block) or it can be sized and shaped prior<br>
to use. In a preferred embodiment, the bone substituting agent is a calcium phosphate<br>
(e.g., β-TCP).<br>
The bone substituting agent can also be provided as a flowable, moldable<br>
paste or putty. Preferably, the bone substituting agent is a calcium phosphate paste<br>
that self-hardens to form a hardened calcium phosphate prior to or after implantation<br>
in vivo. The calcium phosphate component of the invention may be any<br>
biocompatible calcium phosphate material known in the art. The calcium phosphate<br>
material may be produced by any one of a variety of methods and using any suitable<br>
starting components. For example, the calcium phosphate material may include<br>
amorphous, apatitic calcium phosphate. Calcium phosphate material may be<br>
produced by solid-state acid-base reaction of crystalline calcium phosphate reactants<br>

to form crystalline hydroxyapatite solids. Other methods of making calcium<br>
phosphate materials are known in the art, some of which are described below.<br>
The calcium phosphate material can be poorly crystalline apatitic (PCA)<br>
calcium phosphate or hydroxyapatite (HA). PCA material is described in application<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,650,176; 5,783,217; 6,027,742; 6,214,368; 6,287,341; 6,331,312;<br>
and 6,541,037, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. HA is described, for<br>
example, in U.S. PatentNos. Re. 33,221 and Re. 33,161. These patents teach<br>
preparation of calcium phosphate remineralization compositions and of a finely<br>
crystalline, non-ceramic, gradually resorbable hydroxyapatite carrier material based<br>
on the same calcium phosphate composition. A similar calcium phosphate system,<br>
which consists of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and monocalcium phosphate (MCP)<br>
or its monohydrate form (MCPM), is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,053,212 and<br>
5,129,905. This calcium phosphate material is produced by solid-state acid-base<br>
reaction of crystalline calcium phosphate reactants to form crystalline hydroxyapatite<br>
solids.<br>
Crystalline HA materials (commonly referred to as dahllite) may be prepared<br>
such that they are flowable, moldable, and capable of hardening in situ (see U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,962,028). These HA materials (commonly referred to as carbonated<br>
hydroxyapatite) can be formed by combining the reactants with a non-aqueous liquid<br>
to provide a substantially uniform mixture, shaping the mixture as appropriate, and<br>
allowing the mixture to harden in the presence of water (e.g., before or after<br>
implantation). During hardening, the mixture crystallizes into a solid and essentially<br>
monolithic apatitic structure.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
The reactants will generally consist of a phosphate source, e.g., phosphoric<br>
acid or phosphate salts, substantially free of water, an alkali earth metal, particularly<br>
calcium, source, optionally crystalline nuclei, particularly hydroxyapatite or calcium<br>
phosphate crystals, calcium carbonate, and a physiologically acceptable lubricant,<br>
such as any of the non-aqueous liquids described herein. The dry ingredients may be<br>
pre-prepared as a mixture and subsequently combined with the non-aqueous liquid<br>
ingredients under conditions where substantially uniform mixing occurs.<br>
The calcium phosphate material is characterized by its biological resorbability,<br>
biocompatibility, and its minimal crystallinity. Its crystalline character is<br>
substantially the same as natural bone. Preferably, the calcium phosphate material<br>
hardens in less than five hours, and substantially hardens in about one to five hours,<br>
under physiological conditions. Preferably, the material is substantially hardened<br>
within about 10-30 minutes. The hardening rate under physiological conditions, may<br>
be varied according to the therapeutic need by modifying a few simple parameters as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,027,742, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In an embodiment, the resulting bioresorbable calcium phosphate material will<br>
be "calcium deficient," with a calcium to phosphate molar ratio of less than about 1.6<br>
as compared to the ideal stoichiometric value of approximately 1.67 for<br>
hydroxyapatite.<br>
Desirable calcium phosphates are capable of hardening in a moist<br>
environment, at or around body temperature in less than 5 hours and preferably within<br>
10-30 minutes. Desirable materials are those that, when implanted as a 1 -5 g pellet,<br>
are at least 80% resorbed within one year. Preferably, the material can be fully<br>
resorbed.<br>

generally described in Sasai et al., Cell 79:779-790 (1994) (Chordin); PCT Patent<br>
Publication WO94/05800 (Noggin); and Fukui et al., Devel Biol. 159:131 (1993)<br>
(Follistatin). Hedgehog proteins are described in WO96/16668; WO96/17924; and<br>
WO95/18856. The Frazzled family of proteins is a recently discovered family of<br>
proteins with high homology to the extracellular binding domain of the receptor<br>
protein family known as Frizzled. The Frizzled family of genes and proteins is<br>
described in Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:4468-4476 (1996). The active agent may<br>
also include other soluble receptors, such as the truncated soluble receptors disclosed<br>
in PCT patent publication WO95/07982. From the teaching of WO95/07982, one<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that truncated soluble receptors can be prepared for<br>
numerous other receptor proteins. The above publications are incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
The amount of the biologically active protein, e.g., an osteogenic protein, that<br>
is effective to stimulate a desired activity, e.g., increased osteogenic activity of<br>
present or infiltrating progenitor or other cells, will depend upon the size and nature<br>
of the defect being treated, as well as the carrier being employed. Generally, the<br>
amount of protein to be delivered is in arange of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg;<br>
preferably about 1 to about 100 mg; most preferably about 10 to about 80 mg.<br>

Standard protocols and regimens for delivery of the above-listed agents are<br>
known in the art. Biologically active agents are introduced into the implant material<br>
in amounts that allow delivery of an appropriate dosage of the- agent to the implant<br>
site. In most cases, dosages are determined using guidelines known to practitioners<br>
and applicable to the particular agent in question. The exemplary amount of<br>
biologically active agent to be included in the implant material of the invention is<br>
likely'to depend on such variables as the type and extent of the condition, the overall<br>
health status of the particular patient, the formulation of the active agent, and the<br>
bioresorbability of the delivery vehicle used. Standard clinical trials may be used to<br>
optimize the dose and dosing frequency for any particular biologically active agent.<br>

growth factors can be obtained from natural sources, (e.g., platelets), or more<br>
preferably, produced by recombinant DNA technology. When obtained from natural<br>
sources, the PDGF and/or other growth factors can be obtained from a biological<br>
fluid. A biological fluid includes any treated or untreated fluid (including a<br>
suspension) associated with living organisms, particularly blood, including whole<br>
blood, warm or cold blood, and stored or fresh blood; treated blood, such as blood<br>

according to the invention. As used herein, blood product or biological fluid refers to<br>
the components described above, and to similar blood products or biological fluids<br>
obtained by other means and with similar properties. In an embodiment, the PDGF is<br>
obtained from platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The preparation of PRP is described in,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,649,072, 6,641,552, 6,613,566, 6,592,507, 6,558,307,<br>
6,398,972, and 5,599,558, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In an embodiment of all aspects of the invention, the implant material delivers<br>
PDGF at the implant site for a duration of time greater than at least 1 day. In several<br>
embodiments, the implant material delivers PDGF at the implant site for at least 7,14,<br>
21, or 28 days. Preferably, the implant material delivers PDGF at the implant site for<br>
a time between about 1 day and 7,14,21, or 28 days. In another embodiment, the<br>
implant material delivers PDGF at the implant site for a timelgreater than about 1 day,<br>
but less than about 14 days.<br>
By "bioresorbable" is meant the ability of the implant material to be resorbed<br>
or remodeled in vivo. The resorption process involves degradation and elimination of<br>
the original implant material through the action of body fluids, enzymes or cells. The<br>
resorbed materials may be used by the host in the formation of new tissue, or it may<br>
be otherwise re-utilized by the host, or it may be excreted.<br>
By "differentiation factor" is meant a polypeptide, including a chain of at least<br>
6 amino acids, which stimulates differentiation of one or more target cells into cells<br>
with cartilage or bone forming potential.<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
By "nanometer-sized particle" is meant a submicron-sized particle, generally<br>
defined as a particle below 1000 nanometers. A nanometer-sized particle is a solid<br>
particle material that is in an intermediate state between molecular and macron<br>
substances. A nanometer is defined as one billionth of a meter (1 nanometer = 109<br>
m). Nanometer material is known as the powder, fiber, film, pr block having<br>
nanoscale size.<br>
By "periodontium" is meant the tissues that surround and support the teeth.<br>
The periodontium supports, protects, and provides nourishment to the teeth. The<br>
periodontium consists of bone, cementum, alveolar process of the maxillae and<br>
mandible, periodontal ligament, and gingiva. Cementum is a thin, calcified layer of<br>
tissue that completely covers the dentin of the tooth root. Cementum is formed during<br>
the development of the root and throughout the life of the tooth and functions as an<br>
area of attachment for the periodontal ligament fibers. The alveolar process is the<br>
bony portion of the maxilla and mandible where the teeth are embedded and in which<br>
the tooth roots are supported. The alveolar socket is the cavity within the alveolar<br>
process in which the root of the tooth is held by the periodontal ligament. The bone<br>
that divides one socket from another is called the interdental septum. When<br>
multirooted teeth are present, the bone is called the interradicular septum.<br>
The alveolar process includes the cortical plate, alveolar crest, trabecular bone, and<br>
the alveolar bone proper.<br>
By "promoting growth" is meant the healing of bone, periodontium, ligament,<br>
or cartilage, and regeneration of such tissues and structures. Preferably, the bone,<br>
periodontium, ligament, or cartilage is damaged or wounded and requires regeneration<br>
or healing.<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
By "promoting periodontium growth" is meant regeneration or healing of the<br>
supporting tissues of a tooth including alveolar bone, cementum, and interposed<br>
periodontal ligament, which have been damaged by disease or trauma.<br>
By "purified" is meant a growth or differentiation factor, e.g., PDGF, which,<br>
prior to mixing with a carrier substance, is 95% or greater by weight, i.e., the factor is<br>
substantially free of other proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates with which it is naturally<br>
associated. The term "substantially purified" refers to a lesser: purity of factor,<br>
having, for example, only 5%-95% by weight of the factor, preferably 65-95%. A<br>
purified protein preparation will generally yield a single major band on a<br>
polyacrylamide gel. Most preferably, the purified factor used'in implant materials of<br>
the invention is pure as judged by ammo-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The<br>
term "partially purified" refers to PDGF that is provided in the context of PRP, PPP,<br>
FFP, or any other blood product that requires collection and separation, e.g., by<br>
centrirugation, to produce.<br>
By way of example, a solution having ~1.0 mg/mL of PDGF, when -50%<br>
pure, constitutes ~2.0 mg/mL of total protein.<br>
The implant materials of this invention aid in regeneration of periodontium, at<br>
least in part, by promoting the growth of connective tissue, bone, and cementum. The<br>
implant materials can be prepared so that they directly promote the growth and<br>
differentiation of cells that produce connective tissue, bone, and cementum.<br>
Alternatively, the implant materials can be prepared so that they act indirectly by, e.g.,<br>
attracting cells that are necessary for promoting the growth of connective tissue, bone,<br>
and cementum. Regeneration using a composition of this invention is a more<br>
effective treatment of periodontal diseases or bone wounds than that achieved using<br>
systemic antibiotics or surgical debridement alone.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
The PDGF, polypeptide growth factors, and differentiation factors may be<br>
obtained from human tissues or cells, e.g., platelets, by solid phase peptide synthesis,<br>
or by recombinant DNA technology. Thus, by the term "polypeptide growth factor"<br>
or "differentiation factor," we mean tissue or cell-derived, recombinant, or<br>
synthesized materials. If the factor is a dimer, e.g., PDGF, the recombinant factor can<br>
be a recombinant heterodimer, made by inserting into cultured prokaryotic or<br>
eukaryotic cells DNA sequences encoding both subunits of the factor, and then<br>
allowing the translated subunits to be processed by the cells to form a heterodimer<br>
(e.g., PDGF-AB). Alternatively, DNA encoding just one of the subunits (e.g., PDGF<br>
B-chain or A-chain) can be inserted into cells, which then are cultured to produce the<br>
homodimeric factor (e.g., PDGF-BB or PDGF-AA homodimers). PDGF for use in<br>
the methods of the invention includes PDGF homo- and heterodimers, for example,<br>
PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, PDGF-AB, PDGF-CC, and PDGF-DD, and combinations and<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
The concentration of PDGF or other growth factors of the invention can be<br>
determined by using, e.g., an enzyme-linked immunoassay, as described in, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,221,625, 5,141,273, and 5,290,708, incorporated herein by reference, or<br>
any other assay known in the art for determining protein concentration. When<br>
provided herein, the molarconcentration of PDGF is determined based on the<br>
molecular weight of PDGF dimer (e.g., PDGF-BB; MW= approximately 25 kDa).<br>
The methods and implant materials of the invention can be used to heal bony<br>
wounds of mammals, e.g., fractures, implant recipient sites, and sites of periodontal<br>
disease. The implant materials promote connective tissue growth and repair and<br>
enhance bone formation compared to natural healing (i.e., no exogenous agents<br>
added) or healing supplemented by addition of systemic antibiotics. Unlike natural<br>

healing, conventional surgical therapy, or antibiotics, the implant materials of the<br>
invention prompt increased bone, connective tissue (e.g., cartilage and ligament), and<br>
cementum formation when applied to damaged or diseased tissues or to periodontal<br>
disease affected sites. The restoration of these tissues leads to an improved prognosis<br>
for the affected areas. The ability of these factors to stimulate new bone formation<br>
also makes it applicable for treating bony defects caused by other types of infection or<br>
surgical or accidental trauma.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
following description of the embodiments thereof, and from the claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
We now describe several embodiments of the invention. Two examples<br>
demonstrating the use of PDGF as a bone and periodontum healing agent are<br>
presented below.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example I: Preparation of PDGF<br>
Osseous wounds, e.g., following periodontal disease or trauma, are treated and<br>
periodontium, including bone, cementum, and connective tissue, are regenerated,<br>
according to the invention by combining partially purified or purified PDGF with any<br>
of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances described above. Purified<br>
PDGF can be obtained from a recombinant source or from human platelets.<br>
Commercially available recombinant PDGF can be obtained from R&amp;D Systems Inc.<br>
(Minneapolis, MN), BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), and Chemicon, International<br>
(Temecula, CA). Partially purified and purified PDGF can also be prepared as<br>
follows:<br>
Five hundred to 1000 units of washed human platelet pellets are suspended in<br>
1M NaCl (2 ml per platelet unit) and heated at 100°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant<br>
is then separated by centrifugation and the precipitate extracted twice with the lm<br>
NaCl.<br>
The extracts are combined and dialyzed against 0.08M NaCl / 0.01M sodium<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and mixed overnight at 4°C with CM-Sephadex C-50<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
equilibrated with the buffer. The mixture is then poured into a column (5 x 100 cm),<br>
washed extensively with 0.08M NaCl / 0.01M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and<br>
eluted with 1M NaCl while 10 ml fractions are collected.<br>
Active fractions are pooled and dialyzed against 0.3M NaCl / 0.01M sodium<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), centrifuged, and passed at 4°C through a 2.5 x 25 cm<br>
column of blue sepharose (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.3M NaCl / 0.01M sodium<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The column is then washed with the buffer and partially<br>
purified PDGF eluted with a 1:1 solution of 1M NaCl and ethylene glycol.<br>
The partially purified PDGF fractions are diluted (1:1) with 1M NaCl,<br>
dialyzed against 1M acetic acid, and lyophilized. The lyophilized samples are<br>
dissolved in 0.8M NaCl / 0.01M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and passed<br>
through a 1.2 x 40 cm column of CM-Sephadex C-50.equilibrated with the buffer.<br>
PDGF is then eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.08 to 1M).<br>
The active fractions are combined, dialyzed against 1M acetic acid,<br>
lyophilized, and dissolved in a small volume of 1M acetic acid. 0.5 ml portions are<br>
applied to a 1.2 x 100 cm column of Biogel P-150 (100 to 200 mesh) equilibrated<br>
with 1M acetic acid. The PDGF is then eluted with 1M acetic acid while 2 mL<br>
fractions are collected.<br>
Each active fraction containing 100 to 200 mg of protein is lyophilized,<br>
dissolved hi 100 mL of 0.4% trifiuoroacetic acid, and subjected to reverse phase high<br>
performance liquid chromatography on aphenyl Bondapak column (Waters). Elution<br>
with a linear acetonitrile gradient (0 to 60%) yields pure PDGF.<br>

PDGF Made By Recombinant DNA Technology Can Be Prepared As Follows:<br>
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) derived from Human platelets contains<br>
two polypeptide sequences (PDGF-B and PDGF-A polypeptides; Antoniades, H.N.<br>
and Hunkapiller, M., Science 220:963-965,1983). PDGF-B is encoded by a gene<br>
localized on chromosome 7 (Betsholtz, C. et al., Nature 320:695-699), and PDGF-A<br>
is encoded by the sis oncogene (Doolittle, R. et al., Science 221:275-277,1983)<br>
localized on chromosome 22 (Dalla-Favera, R., Science 218:686-688,1982). The sis<br>
gene encodes the transforming protein of the Simian Sarcoma Virus (SSV) which is<br>
closely related to PDGF-2 polypeptide. The human cellular c-sis also encodes the<br>
PDGF-A chain (Rao, C. D. et si., Proa Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:2392-2396,1986).<br>
Because the two polypeptide chains of PDGF are coded by two different genes<br>
localized in separate chromosomes, the possibility exists that human PDGF consists<br>
of a disulfide-linked heterodimer of PDGF-B and PDGF-A, or a mixture of the two<br>
homodimers (PDGF-BB hornodimer and PDGF-AA homodimer), or a mixture of the<br>
heterodimer and the two homodimers.<br>
Mammalian cells in culture infected with the Simian Sarcoma Virus, which<br>
contains the gene encoding the PDGF-A chain, were shown to synthesize the PDGF-<br>
A polypeptide and to process it into a disulfide-linked homodimer (Robbins et al.,<br>
Nature 305:605-608,1983). In addition, the PDGF-A homoldimer reacts with antisera<br>
raised against human PDGF. Furthermore, the functional properties of the secreted<br>
PDGF-A homodimer are similar to those of platelet-derived iPDGF in that it<br>
stimulates DNA synthesis in cultured fibroblasts, it induces phosphorylation at the<br>
tyrosine residue of a 185 kD cell membrane protein, and it is capable of competing<br>
with human (125I)-PDGF for binding to specific cell surface PDGF receptors (Owen,<br>
'&gt;     A. et al., Science 225:54-56,1984). Similar properties were shown for the sis/PDGF-<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
A gene product derived from cultured normal human cells (fpr example, human<br>
arterial endothelial cells), or from human malignant cells expressing the sis/PDGF-2<br>
gene (Antoniades, H. et al., Cancer Cells 3:145-151,1985).<br>
The recombinant PDGF-B homodimer is obtained by the introduction of<br>
cDNA clones of c-sis/PDGF-B gene into mouse cells using an expression vector. The<br>
c-sis/PDGF-B clone used for the expression was obtained from normal human<br>
cultured endothelial cells (Collins, T., et al., Nature 216:748-750, 1985).<br>
Use of PDGF<br>
PDGF alone or in combination with other growth factors is useful for<br>
promoting bone healing, bone growth and regeneration or healing of the supporting<br>
structures of teeth injured by trauma or disease. It is also useful for promoting healing<br>
of a site of extraction of a tooth, for mandibular ridge augmentation, or at tooth<br>
implant sites. Bone healing would also be enhanced at sites of bone fracture or in<br>
infected areas, e.g., osteomyelitis, or at tumor sites. PDGF is also useful for<br>
promoting growth and healing of a ligament, e.g., the periodontal ligament, and of<br>
cemenrum.<br>
In use, the PDGF or other growth or differentiation factor is applied directly to<br>
the area needing healing or regeneration. Generally, it is applied in a resorbable or<br>
non-resorbable carrier as a liquid or solid, and the site then cpvered with a bandage or<br>
nearby tissue. An amount sufficient to promote bone growth is generally between 500<br>
ng and 5 mg for a 1 cm2 area, but the upper limit is really 1 mg for a 1 cm2 area, with<br>
a preferred amount of PDGF applied being 0.3 mg/mL.<br>

Example II: Periodontal Regeneration With rhPDGF-BB Treated Osteoconductive<br>
Scaffolds<br>
The effectiveness of PDGF in promoting periodontium and bone growth is<br>
demonstrated by the following study.<br>
In Vivo Dog Study<br>
The beagle dog is the most widely used animal model for testing putative<br>
periodontal regeneration materials and procedures (Wikesjo et al., J. Clin.<br>
Periodontol. "15:73-78, 1988; Wikesjo et al.,/. Clin. Periodontol 16:116-119, 1999;<br>
Cho et al., J. Periodontol. 66:522-530,1995; Giamobile et al., J. Periodontol.<br>
69:129-137, 1998; and Clergeau et al., J. Periodontol. 67:140-149, 1996). Plaque and<br>
calculus accumulation can induce gingival inflammation that may lead to marginal<br>
bone loss and the etiology of periodontitis in dogs and humans can be compared. In<br>
naturally occurring disease, however, there is a lack of uniformity between defects.<br>
Additionally, as more attention has been given to oral health in canine breeder<br>
colonies, it has become impractical to obtain animals with natural periodontal disease.<br>
Therefore, the surgically-induced horizontal Class HI furcation model has become one<br>
of the most commonly used models to investigate periodontal healing and<br>
regeneration.<br>
Beagle dogs with horizontal Class III furcation defects were treated using<br>
PDGF compositions of the invention. Fifteen adult beagle dogs contributed 60 treated<br>
defects. Forty-two defects were biopsied two months after treatment and fifteen<br>
defects were biopsied four months after treatment<br>

Defect Preparation<br>
The "critical-size" periodontal defect model as described by numerous<br>
investigators was utilized (see, e.g., Wikesjo, 1988 and 1999, supra; Giannobile,<br>
supra, Cho, supra, and Park et al., J. Periodontol. 66:462-477, 1995). Both<br>
mandibular quadrants in 16 male beagle dogs (2-3 years old) without general and oral<br>
health problems were used. One month prior to dosing, the animals were sedated with<br>
a subcutaneous injection of atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and acepromazine (0.2 mg/kg)<br>
approximately 30 minutes prior to being anesthetized with an IV injection of<br>
pentobarbital sodium (25 mg/kg). Following local infiltration of the surgical area<br>
with Lidocaine HC1 plus epinephrine 1:100,000, full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps<br>
were reflected and the first and third premolars (P1 and P3) were extracted.<br>
Additionally, the mesial portion of the crown of the 1st molar was resected.<br>
Alveolar bone was then removed around the entire circumference of P2 and<br>
P4, including the furcation areas using chisels and water-cooled carbide and diamond<br>
burs. Horizontal bone defects were created such that there was a distance of 5 mm<br>
from the fornix of the furcation to the crest of the bone. The defects were<br>
approximately 1 cm wide, depending on the width of the tooth. The roots of all<br>
experimental teeth were planed with curettes and ultrasonic instruments and<br>
instrumented with a tapered diamond bur to remove cementum. After the<br>
standardized bone defects were created the grngival flaps were sutured to achieve<br>
primary closure. The animals were fed a soft diet and received daily chlorhexidine<br>
rinses for the duration of the study.<br>

Application of Graft Material<br>
The periodontal defects of P2 and P4 in each mandibular quadrant of the 15<br>
animals were randomized prior to treatment using sealed envelopes. About four<br>
weeks after defect preparation, animals were re-anesthetized as described above and<br>
full thickness flaps were reflected in both mandibular quadrants. A notch was placed<br>
in the tooth root surfaces at the residual osseous crest using al/2 round bur to serve as<br>
a future histologic reference point. The sites were irrigated with sterile saline and the<br>
roots were treated with citric acid as described previously for the purpose of<br>
decontamination and removal of the smear layer (See, e.g., Cho, supra, and Park,<br>
supra). During this period an amount of β-TCP or DFDBA Sufficient to fill the<br>
periodontal defect was saturated with a solution of rhPDGF-BB solution (0.3 or 1.0<br>
mg/nal) and the rhPDGF-BB/graft mixture was allowed to sit on the sterile surgical<br>
stand for about ten minutes. The rhPDGF-BB saturated graft was then packed into<br>
the defect with gentle pressure to the ideal level of osseous regeneration.<br>
After implantation of the graft material, the mucoperiosteal flaps were sutured<br>
approximately level to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) using interproximal,<br>
interrupted 4.0 expanded polytetrafiuoroethylene (ePTFE) sutures. Following<br>
suturing of the flaps chlorhexidine gluconate gel was gently placed around the teeth<br>
and gingivae.<br>

WO 2006/044334                                                                                               PCT/US2005/036447<br>
Accordingly, at 8 weeks there are 7 groups divided among 42 sites in 11 dogs.<br>
At 16 weeks, there are 3 groups divided among 15 sites in 4 dogs (one dog received<br>
two treatment surgeries staggered eight weeks apart and thus contributed two sites to<br>
each, the 8 and 16 week time points).<br>
Post-surgical Treatment<br>
The surgical sites were protected by feeding the dogs a soft diet during the<br>
first 4 weeks post-operative. To insure optimal healing, systemic antibiotic treatment<br>
with penicillin G benzathine was provided for the first two weeks and plaque control<br>
was maintained by daily irrigation with 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate throughout the<br>
experiment. Sutures were removed after 3 weeks.<br>
Data Collection<br>
Rationale for Data Collection Points<br>
The eight week time point was chosen because this is the most common time<br>
point reported for this model in the literature and therefore there are substantial<br>
historical data. For example, Wikesjo et al, supra, and Giannobile et al., supra, also<br>
chose 8 weeks to assess the regenerative effects of BMP-2 and OP-1, respectively, in<br>
the same model. Additionally, Park et al., supra, evaluated the effect or rhPDGF-BB<br>
applied directly to the conditioned root surface with and without GTR membranes in<br>
the beagle dog model at 8 weeks. These studies, strongly suggest that the 8 week<br>
period should be optimal for illustrating potential significant effects among the<br>
various treatment modalities.<br>

The sixteen week time point was chosen to assess long-term effects of growth<br>
factor treatment. Previous studies (Park et al., supra) suggest that by this time there is<br>
substantial spontaneous healing of the osseous defects. Nevertheless, it is possible to<br>
assess whether rhPDGF-BB treatment leads to any unusual or: abnormal tissue<br>
response, such as altered bone remodeling, tumorgenesis or root resorption.<br>
Biopsies and Treatment Assessments<br>
At the time of biopsy, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde<br>
and sacrificed. The mandibles were then removed and placed in fixative.   Periapical<br>
radiographs were taken and the treated sites were cut into individual blocks using a<br>
diamond saw. The coded (blinded) blocks were wrapped in gauze, immersed in a<br>
solution of 4% formaldehyde, processed, and analyzed.<br>
During processing the biopsies were dehydrated in ethanol and infiltrated and<br>
embedded in methylmethacrylate. Undecalcified sections of approximately 300 μm in<br>
thickness were obtained using a low speed diamond saw with coolant The sections<br>
were glued onto opalescent acrylic glass, ground to a final thickness of approximately<br>
80 μm, and stained with toludine blue and basic fuchsin. Step serial sections were<br>
obtained in a mesiodistal plane.<br>
Histomorphometric analyses were performed on the masked slides. The<br>
following parameters were assessed:<br>
1. Length of Complete New Attachment Apparatus (CNAA): Periodontal<br>
regeneration measured as the distance between the coronal level of the old bone and<br>
the coronal level of the new bone, including only that new bone adjacent to new<br>

cementum with functionally oriented periodontal ligament between the new bone and<br>
new cementum.<br>
2.  New Bone Fill (NB): Measured as the cross-sectional area of new bone<br>
formed within the furcation.<br>
3.  Connective Tissue fill (CT): Measured as the area within the furcation<br>
occupied by gingival connective tissue.<br>
4.  Void (VO): The area of recession where there is an absence of tissue.<br>
Results<br>
A.   Clinical observations<br>
Clinically, all sites healed well.   There was an impression that the sites treated<br>
with rhPDGF-BB healed more quickly, as indicated by the presence of firm, pink<br>
gingivae within one week post-operatively. There were no adverse events<br>
experienced in any treatment group as assessed by visual inspection of the treated<br>
sites. There appeared to be increased gingival recession in groups that received /3-<br>
TCP or DFDBA alone.<br>
B.  Radiograpkic observations<br>
Radiographically, there was evidence of increased bone formation at two<br>
months as judged by increased radiopacity in Groups 2, 3 (/3-TCP + rhPDGF-BB 0.3<br>
and 1.0 mg/ml, respectively) and 6 (DFDBA + rhPDGF-BB 1.0 mg/ml) compared to<br>
the other groups (Figures 1A-G). At four months, there was evidence of increased<br>
bone formation in all groups compared to the two month time point. There was no<br>
radiographic evidence of any abnormal bone remodeling, root resorption, or ankylosis<br>
in any group.<br>

C. Histomorphometric analyses:<br>
Histomorphometric assessment of the length of new cementum, new bone, and<br>
new periodontal ligament (CNAA) as well as new bone fill, connective tissue fill, and<br>
void space were evaluated and are expressed as percentages. In the case of CNAA,<br>
values for each test group represent the CNAA measurements (length in mm)/ total<br>
available CNAA length (in mm) x 100%. Bone fill, connective tissue fill and void<br>
space were evaluated and are expressed as percentages of the total furcation defect<br>
area.<br>
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for overall<br>
differences among treatment groups, and pairwise comparisons were made using the<br>
student's t-test. Significant differences between groups were found upon analyses of<br>
the coded slides. Table 4 shows the results at two months.<br>

Table 4. Two month histometric analyses<br><br>
The mean percent periodontal regeneration (CNAA) in the surgery without<br>
grafts and surgery plus /3-TCP alone groups were 27% and 37%, respectively. In<br>
contrast, β-TCP groups containing rhPDGF-BB exhibited significantly greater<br>
periodontal regeneration (p
and 46% respectively for the 0.3 and 1.0 mg/ml concentrations versus 27% for<br>
surgery alone and 13% for DFDBA alone). Finally, the β-TCP group containing 0.3<br>
mg/ml rhPDGF-BB demonstrated significantly greater periodontal regeneration<br>
(p
versus 21%).<br>
Bone fill was significantly greater (p
rhPDGF-BB (84.0%) and the β-TCP + 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB (74.2%) groups than<br>
in the /3-TCP alone (28.0%), surgery alone (34%) or DFDBA alone (6%) treatment<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
groups. There was also significantly greater bone fill (p
mg/ml rhPDGF-BB group compared to the DFDBA + 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB group<br>
(84% and 20% respectively).<br>
The group of analyses examining the 8-week data from the DFDBA groups<br>
and the surgery alone group (Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7) demonstrated no statistically<br>
significant differences between the DFDBA groups and surgery alone for periodontal<br>
regeneration (CNAA). There was a trend toward greater regeneration for those sites<br>
treated with the 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB enhanced DFDBA versus DFDBA alone.<br>
There was significantly greater bone fill (p
mg/ml rhPDGF-BB than DFDBA alone (46 and 6% respectively). There was a trend<br>
toward greater bone fill for sites treated with DFDBA containing 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF-<br>
BB compared to DFDBA alone or surgery alone. However, sites treated with DFDBA<br>
alone demonstrated less bone fill into the defect than surgery alone (6 and 34%,<br>
respectively), with most of the defect being devoid of any fill or fill consisting of<br>
gingival (soft) connective tissue.<br>
At four months following treatment, there remained significant differences in<br>
periodontal regeneration. β-TCP alone, as a result of extensive ankylosis, resulted in<br>
36% regeneration, while the sites treated with β-TCP containing rhPDGF-BB had a<br>
mean regeneration of 58% and 49% in the 0.3 and 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB<br>
concentrations. Substantial bone fill was present in all three treatment groups. /3-TCP<br>
alone resulted in 70% bone fill, β-TCP plus 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF yielded 100% fill<br>
while the 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF group had 75% fill.<br>

D. Histologic Evaluation<br>
Histologic evaluation was performed for all biopsies except one, in which<br>
evaluation was not possible due to difficulties encountered during processing.<br>
Representative photomicrographs are shown in Figures 1A-G and 2A-C.<br>
Figure 1A shows results from a site treated with surgery alone (no grafts). This<br>
specimen demonstrates limited periodontal regeneration (new bone (NB), new<br>
cementum (NC), and periodontal ligament (PDL)) as evidenced in the area of the<br>
notches and extending only a short distance coronally. The area of the furcation is<br>
occupied primarily by dense soft connective tissue (CT) with; minimal new bone (NB)<br>
formation.<br>
For sites treated with β-TCP alone (Figure 1B) there is periodontal<br>
regeneration, similar to that observed for the surgery alone specimen, that extends<br>
from the base of the notches for a short distance coronally. As was seen in the<br>
surgery alone specimens, there was very little new bone formation with the greatest<br>
area of the furcation being occupied by soft connective tissue.<br>
In contrast, Figure 1C illustrates results obtained for sites treated with /3-TCP<br>
+ 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB. Significant periodontal regeneration is shown with new<br>
bone, new cementum, and periodontal ligament extending along the entire surface of<br>
the furcation. Additionally, the area of the furcation is filled; with new bone that<br>
extends the entire height of the furcation to the fornix.<br>
Representative results for sites treated with β-TCP + 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB<br>
are shown in Figure 1D. While there is significant periodontal regeneration in the<br>
furcation, it does not extend along the entire surface of the furcation. There is new<br>

WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
bone formation present along with soft connective tissue that is observed at the<br>
coronal portion of the defect along with a small space which is void of any tissue<br>
(VO) at the fornix of the furcation.<br>
Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C illustrate results obtained for the allograft treatment<br>
groups. Representative results for the DFDBA alone group (Figure 2A) shows very<br>
poor periodontal regeneration that is limited to the area of the notches extending only<br>
slightly in a coronal direction. New bone formation is limited and consists of small<br>
amounts of bone formation along the surface of residual DFDBA graft material (dark<br>
red staining along lighter pink islands). Additionally, the new bone is surrounded by<br>
extensive soft connective tissue that extends coronally to fill a significant area within<br>
the furcation. Finally, a large void space extends from the coronal extent of the soft<br>
connective tissue to the fornix of the furcation.<br>
Histologic results for the DFDBA + 0.3 and 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB are shown<br>
in Figures 2B and 2C, respectively. Both groups demonstrate greater periodontal<br>
regeneration compared to DFDBA alone with a complete new attachment apparatus<br>
(new bone, new cementum, and periodontal ligament) extending from the base of the<br>
notches in the roots for a short distance coronally (arrows). They also had greater<br>
bone fill within the area of the furcation, although there was significant fill of the<br>
furcation with soft connective tissue.<br>

Conclusions<br>
Based on the results of the study, treatment of a periodontal defect using<br>
rhPDGF-BB at either 0.3 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL in combination with a suitable carrier<br>
material (e.g., β-TCP) results in greater periodontal regeneration than the current<br>
products or procedures, such as grafts with jS-TCP or bone allograft alone, or<br>
periodontal surgery without grafts.<br>
Treatment with the 0.3 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL concentration of rhPDGF<br>
resulted in periodontal regeneration. The 0.3 mg/ml concentration of rhPDGF<br>
demonstrated greater periodontal regeneration and percent bone fill as compared to<br>
the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of rhPDGF when mixed with./3-TCP.<br>
β-TCP was more effective than allograft when mixed with rhPDGF-BB at any<br>
concentration. The new bone matured (remodeled) normally over time (0, 8, and 16<br>
weeks) in all groups. There was no increase in ankylosis or root resorption in the<br>
rhPDGF groups, in fact, sites receiving rhPDGF-BB tended; to have less ankylosis<br>
than control sites. This finding may result from the fact thatrhPDGF-BB is mitogenic<br>
and chemotactic for periodontal ligament cells.<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Materials Utilized: Test and Control Articles<br>
The β-TCP utilized had a particle-size (0.25 mm - 1.0 mm) that was optimized<br>
for periodontal use. Based on studies using a canine model,, administered /3-TCP is<br>
~80% resorbed within three months and is replaced by autologous bone during the<br>
healing process.<br>

The DFDBA was supplied by Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF).<br>
The material was dog allograft, made by from the bones of a dog that was killed<br>
following completion of another study that tested a surgical procedure that was<br>
deemed to have no effect on skeletal tissues.<br>
Recombinant hPDGF-BB was supplied by BioMimetic Pharmaceuticals and<br>
was manufactured by Chiron, Inc, the only supplier of FDA-approved rhPDGF-BB<br>
for human use. This rhPDGF-BB was approved by the FDA as a wound healing<br>
product under the trade name of Regranex®.<br>
One ml syringes containing 0.5 ml of sterile rhPDGF-BB at two separate<br>
concentrations prepared in conformance with FDA standards for human materials and<br>
according to current applicable Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMP).<br>
Concentrations tested included 0.3 mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml.<br>
β-TCP was provided in vials containing 0.5 cc of sterile particles.<br>
DFDBA was provided in 2.0 ml syringes containing 1.0 cc of sterile,<br>
demineralized fireeze-dried dog bone allograft.<br>
Material Preparation<br>
At the time of the surgical procedure, the final implanted grafts were prepared<br>
by mixing the rhPDGF-BB solution with the matrix materials. Briefly, an amount of<br>
TCP or allograft sufficient to completely fill the osseous defect was placed into a<br>
sterile dish. The rhPDGF-BB solution sufficient to completely saturate the matrix<br>
was then added, the materials were mixed and allowed to sit on the surgical tray for<br>
about 10 minutes at room temperature prior to being placed in the osseous defect.<br>

WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
A 10 minute incubation time with the β-TCP material is sufficient to obtain<br>
maximum adsorption of the growth factor (see Appendix A). This is also an<br>
appropriate amount of time for surgeons in a clinical setting to have prior to<br>
placement of the product into the periodontal defect. Similarly, in a commercial<br>
market, the rhPDGF-BB and the matrix material can be supplied in separate<br>
containers in a kit and that the materials can be mixed directly before placement. This<br>
kit concept would greatly simplify product shelf life/stability considerations.<br>
Example HI: Use of PDGF For The Treatment Of Periodontal Bone Defects in<br>
Humans<br>
Recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB) was tested for its effect on the<br>
regeneration of periodontal bone in human subjects. Two test groups were<br>
administered rhPDGF-BB at either 0.3 mg/rnL (Group I) or 1.0 mg/mL (Group IT).<br>
rhPDGF-BB was prepared in sodium acetate buffer and administered in a vehicle of<br>
beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). The control group, Group EH, was administered<br>
/3-TCP in sodium acetate buffer only.<br>
The objective of clinical study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of<br>
graft material comprising β-TCP and rhPDGF-BB at either 0.3 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL<br>
in the management of one (1) to three (3) wall intra-osseous periodontal defects and to<br>
assess its regenerative capability in bone and soft tissue.<br>
Study Design and Duration of Treatment<br>
The study was a double-blind, controlled, prospective, randomized, parallel<br>
designed, multi-center clinical trial in subjects who required surgical intervention to<br>
treat a bone defect adjacent to the natural dentition. The subjects were randomized in<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
equal proportions to result in three (3) treatment groups of approximately 60 subjects<br>
each (180 total). The duration of the study was six (6) months following implantation<br>
of the study device. The study enrolled 180 subjects.<br>
Diagnosis and Main Entry Criteria<br>
Male and female subjects, 25-75 years of age, with advanced periodontal<br>
disease in at least one site requiring surgical treatment to correct a bone defect were<br>
admitted to the study. Other inclusion criteria included: 1) a probing pocket depth<br>
measuring 7 mm or greater at the baseline visit; 2) after surgical debridement, 4 mm<br>
or greater vertical bone defect (BD) with at least 1 bony wall; 3) sufficient keratinized<br>
tissue to allow complete tissue coverage of the defect; and, 4) radiographic base of<br>
defect at least 3 mm coronal to the apex of the tooth. Subjects who smoked up to 1<br>
pack a day and who had teeth with Class I &amp; It furcation involvement were<br>
specifically allowed.<br>
Dose and Mode of Administration<br>
All treatment kits contained 0.25 g of /3-TCP (an active control) and either 0.5<br>
mL sodium acetate buffer solution alone (Group HI), 0.3 mg/mL rbPDGF-BB (Group<br>
I), or 1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB (Group II).<br>
Following thorough debridement and root planing, the test solution was mixed<br>
with β-TCP in a sterile container, such that the β-TCP was fully saturated. Root<br>
surfaces were conditioned using either tetracycline, EDTA, or citric acid. The<br>
hydrated graft was then packed into the osseous defect and the tissue flaps were<br>
secured with interdental sutures to achieve complete coverage of the surgical site.<br>

Effectiveness Measurement<br>
The primary effectiveness measurement included the change in clinical<br>
attachment level (CAL) between baseline and six months post-surgery (Group I vs.<br>
Group III). The secondary effectiveness measurements consisted of the following<br>
outcomes: 1) linear bone growth (LBG) and % bone fill (%BF) from baseline to six<br>
months post-surgery based on the radiographic assessments (Group I and Group II vs.<br>
Group III); 2) change in CAL between baseline and six months post-surgery (Group II<br>
vs. Group III); 3) probing pocket depth reduction (PDR) between baseline and six<br>
months post-surgery (Group I and Group II vs. Group HI); 4) gingival recession (GR)<br>
between baseline and six months post-surgery (Group I and Group H vs. .Group HI);<br>
5) wound healing (WH) of the surgical site during the first three weeks post-surgery<br>
(Group I and Group II vs. Group IE); 6) area under the curve for the change in CAL<br>
between baseline and three (3) and six (6) months (Group I and Group II vs. Group<br>
HI); 7) the 95% lower confidence bound (LCB) for %BF at six (6) months post-<br>
surgery (Groups I, II and HI vs. demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA)<br>
as published in the literature; Parashis et al., J. Periodontol. 69:751-758,1998); 8) the<br>
95% LCB for linear bone growth at six (6) months post-surgery (Groups I, II, and HI<br>
vs. demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) as published in the literature;<br>
Persson et al., J. Clin. Periodontol. 27:104-108, 2000); 9) the 95% LCB for the change<br>
in CAL between baseline and six (6) months (Groups L n, and II vs. EMDOGATN® -<br>
PMA P930021,1996); and 10) the 95% LCB for the change in CAL between baseline<br>
and six (6) months (Groups I, E and m vs. PEPGEN P-15™ - PMA P990033,1999).<br>

Statistical Methods<br>
Safety and effectiveness data were examined and summarized by descriptive<br>
statistics. Categorical measurements were displayed as counts andpercents, and<br>
continuous variables were displayed as means, medians, standard deviations and<br>
ranges. Statistical comparisons between the test product treatment groups (Groups I<br>
and II) and the control (Group III) were made using Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact<br>
tests for categorical variables and t-tests or Analysis of Variance Methods (ANOVA)<br>
for continuous variables. Comparisons between treatment grpups for ordinal<br>
variables were made using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel methods. A p
was considered to be statistically significant for CAL, LBG and %BF.<br>
Safety data were assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events as<br>
evaluated clinically and radiographically. There were no significant differences between the<br>
three treatment groups at baseline. There were also no statistically significant<br>
differences observed in the incidence of adverse events (AEs; all causes) among the<br>
three treatment groups. The safety analysis did not identify any increased risk to the<br>
subject due to implantation of the graft material.<br>
Summary of Effectiveness Results<br>
The results from the statistical analyses revealed both: clinically and<br>
statistically significant benefits for the two treatment groups (Groups I and II),<br>
compared to the active control of β-TCP alone (Group III) and historical controls<br>
including DFDBA, EMDOGAIN®, and PEPGEN P-15™.<br>
At three months post-surgery, a statistically significant CAL gain from<br>
baseline was observed in favor of Group I versus Group III (p = 0.041), indicating<br>
that there are significant early benefits of PDGF on the gain in CAL. At six months<br>
50<br><br>
WO 2006/044334                                                                                              PCT/US2005/036447<br>
post-surgery, this trend continued to favor Group I over Group III, although this<br>
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.200). The area under the curve<br>
analysis (AUC) which represents the cumulative effect (i.e. speed) for CAL gain<br>
between baseline and six months approached statistical significance favoring Group I<br>
     in comparison to Group III (p=0.054). Further, the 95% lower, confidence bound<br>
(LCB) analyses for all treatment groups substantiated the effectiveness of Groups I<br>
and II compared to the CAL gains observed at six (6) months for EMDOGAIN® and<br>
PEPGENP-15™.<br>
In addition to the observed clinical benefits of CAL, radiographic analyses<br>
     including Linear Bone Growth (LBG) and Percent Bone Fill (%BF), revealed<br>
statistically significant improvement in bone gain for Groups I and II vs. Group III.<br>
%BF was defined as the percent of the original osseous defect filled with new bone as<br>
measured radiographically. LBG showed significant improvement in Group I<br>
(2.5mm) when compared to Group III (0.9mm, pO.OOl). LBG was also significant<br>
     for Group II (1.5mm) when compared to Group IE (p=0.021).<br>
Percent Bone Fill (%BF) was significantly increased at six months post-<br>
surgical in Group I (56%) and Group II (34%) when compared to Group III (18%), for<br>
a p
interval at six months post-surgery, for both linear bone growth and % bone fill,<br>
     substantiated the effectiveness of Groups I and II compared to the published<br>
radiographic results for DFDBA, the most widely used material for periodontal<br>
grafting procedures.<br>
At three months, there was significantly less Gingival Recession (GR)<br>
(p=0.041) for Group I compared to Group IE consistent with the beneficial effect<br>
      observed with CAL. No statistically significant differences were observed in PDR<br>

and GR at six months. Descriptive analysis of the number of sites exhibiting<br>
complete wound healing (WE) at three weeks revealed improvements in Group I<br>
(72%) vs. Group II (60%) and Group HI (55%), indicating a trend toward improved<br>
healing.<br>
To assess the cumulative beneficial effect for clinical and radiographic<br>
outcomes, a composite effectiveness analysis was performed to determine the percent<br>
of patients with a successful outcome as defined by CAL &gt; 2.7mm and LBG &gt; 1.1mm<br>
at six (6) months. The CAL and LBG benchmarks of success were established by the<br>
mean levels achieved for these parameters by the implanted grafts, as identified in the<br>
"Effectiveness Measures" section above. The results showed that 61.7% of Group I<br>
patients and 37.9% of Group II patients met or exceeded the composite benchmark for<br>
success compared to 30.4% of Group HI patients, resulting in a statistically significant<br>
benefit of Group I vs. Group III (p
(70.0%) vs. Group HI (44.6%) for p-value of 0.003.<br>
In summary, Group I achieved statistically beneficial results for CAL and GR<br>
at three (3) months as well as LBG and %BF at six (6) months, compared to the β-<br>
TCP alone active control group (Group III). The clinical significance of these results<br>
is further confirmed by comparison to historical controls. It is concluded that PDGF-<br>
containing graft material was shown to achieve clinical and radiographic effectiveness<br>
by six months for the treatment of periodontal osseous defects.<br>

Graft material (i.e., β-TCP) containing PDGF at 0.3 mg/mL and at 1.0 mg/mL<br>
was shown to be safe and effective in the restoration of alveolar bone and clinical<br>
attachment around teeth with moderate to advanced periodontitis in a large,<br>
randomized, clinical trial involving 180 subjects studied for up to 6 months. These<br>
conclusions are based upon validated radiographic and clinical measurements as<br>
summarized below.<br>
Consistent with the biocompatibility data of the PDGF-containing graft<br>
material, discussed above, and the historical safe use of each individual component<br>
(i.e., /3-TCP alone or PDGF alone), the study revealed no evidence of either local or<br>
systemic adverse effects. There were no adverse outcomes attributable to the graft<br>
material, which was found to be safe.<br>

WO 2006/044334                                                                                               PCTVUS2005/036447<br>
Conclusion<br>
Implantation of /3-TCP containing PDGF at either 0.3 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL<br>
was found to be an effective treatment for the restoration of soft tissue attachment<br>
level and bone as shown by significantly improved CAL at 3 months compared to the<br>
active control. Our findings are also consistent with the AUC; analysis that showed an<br>
improvement in CAL gain between baseline and six months. Implantation of (3-TCP<br>
containing PDGF at either 0.3 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL was also found to be an effective<br>
treatment based on significantly improved LBG and %BF compared to the active<br>
control. Significantly improved clinical outcomes as shown by the composite analysis<br>
of both soft and hard tissue measurements compared to the /3-TCP alone active control<br>
also demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment protocol described above. Finally,<br>
 the results of administering /3-TCP containing PDGF at either 0.3 mg/rnL or 1.0<br>
mg/mL were found to exceed established benchmarks of effectiveness both clinically<br>
and radiographically.<br>
The results of this trial together with extensive and confirmatory data from in<br>
vitro, animal and human studies demonstrate that PDGF-containing graft material<br>
stimulates soft and hard tissue regeneration in periodontal defects, although the effects<br>
were more significant when PDGF in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL (e.g., 0.1 mg/mL,<br>
0.3 mg/mL, or 1.0 mg/mL) was administered in the graft material. Moreover, PDGF<br>
administered in the graft material in the amount of 0.3 mg/mL effectively regenerated<br>
soft tissue and bone.<br>
Other embodiments are within the following claims.<br>
