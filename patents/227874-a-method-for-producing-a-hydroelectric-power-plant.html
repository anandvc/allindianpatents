				<td>Method for producing a hydropower plant<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a device for obtaining electrical energy from hydropower, and to a method for modifying a dam, in particular a weir.<br>
The production of hydroelectric power plants entails a high outlay on construction work, for example the production of a retaining dam, of a penstock, of a powerhouse, etc., compared to the production of other power plants, such as natural gas, coal, etc., and consequently the costs of obtaining energy are in relative terms higher and/or the amortization time of the investment accordingly rises considerably. Furthermore, a power plant of this type represents a not insignificant intervention in the ecology of the waterway. Therefore, where other energy sources are available, hydropower is in many cases, in particular for high powers, difficult to justify from economic and ecological standpoints.<br>
A different route is followed by WO 89/00646 Al, which describes a method for producing a hydroelectric power plant at an existing dam. In this case, part of a module for generating electrical energy is produced at a remote production site, transported to the site of use and completed on site by installing the required hydraulic machinery. In this method, therefore, it is still necessary to carry out complex assembly work on site, and the corresponding tools, auxiliary means and labor are also required for this purpose.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is based on the object of providing a method for producing a device for obtaining electrical energy which, compared to conventional power plants, is less expensive and is justifiable from an ecological standpoint, and in<br><br>
particular is able to compete with other energy sources. Furthermore, the present invention is based on the object of providing a novel method for modifying a dam which satisfies the above demands.<br>
According to the invention, in a method for producing a device for obtaining electrical energy from hydropower, the following steps are carried out: production of at least two turbine-generator units, comprising a turbine and a generator connected to it, connection of at least two turbine-generator units to one another to form at least one module, transportation of at least one module by means of a means of transport, preferably a water-borne craft, from the production site over a distance to the site of use, and, at the site of use, lifting of the at least one module off the means of transport by means of a lifting fixture and positioning it in a position which is provided for its operation. In the inventive method for modifying a dam, in particular a weir, the following steps are carried out: selection of an existing dam having an upper water level and a lower water level, and having at least two stationary structures, in particular piers, and having moveable structures for controlling the level, e.g. a gate or flap, arranged between the stationary structures, production of at least two turbine-generator units, comprising a turbine and a generator connected to it, connection of at least two turbine-generator units to one another to form at least one module, transportation of at least one module from the production site over a distance to the site of use by means of a means of transport, preferably a water-borne craft, and, at the site of use, lifting of the at least one module off the means of transport by means of a lifting fixture provided at the dam, and positioning it in a position, which is provided for its operation, between two stationary structures, the module being used to obtain electrical energy in its<br><br>
operating position instead of or in addition to the moveable structure.<br>
The possibility of prefabricating turbine-generator units and connecting them to form a module at a remote location, e.g. a dockyard, makes it possible to produce the energy-generating units relatively inexpensively and to test them in advance, so that significantly faster assembly and rapid commissioning are possible in situ. Furthermore, according to the invention transport by means of a ship is possible, which can be achieved significantly less expensively and more quickly for the large electromechanical units used in river power plants. It is also possible for the positioning and final installation of the electromechanical units to be carried out by means of a crane which is in any case already present for other purposes at dams, so that there is no need to use standard construction cranes. The present invention is particularly advantageous for use in an existing dam which, although constructed for purposes other than energy generation, can be converted to an energy-generating installation using the method according to the invention, since for this application the construction costs, for example for constructing the powerhouse, are eliminated altogether. In combination with the special modular configuration of the electromechanical units, it is now possible, using the method according to the invention, to use a technology which is inherently highly environmentally friendly, such as hydropower, to obtain energy under economically attractive framework conditions, and what is more without any further intervention in the ecological system. The modification may advantageously be used as a technical measure for reducing greenhouse gases.<br>
Further advantageous variants and supplements to the method according to the invention will emerge from the dependent subclaims.<br><br>
Additional details and advantages of the method according to the invention will emerge from the following description of a nonlimiting exemplary embodiment, in which reference is made to the appended figures.<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail with reference to the diagrammatic, nonlimiting Figs. I to 5. Figs. 1 to 5 show, by way of example, the sequence involved in the inventive method for producing a device for obtaining electrical energy from hydropower.<br>
In Fig. 1, the module 1 is located at the means of transport, in this case a ship 3, at a production site in a dockyard which does not correspond to the future site of use. At this production site, a plurality of turbine-generator units 2 are connected to one another, preferably directly at the ship 3, to form a module 1 for obtaining electrical energy.<br>
If necessary, it is, of course, also possible for a plurality of modules 1 comprising turbine-generator units 2 to be assembled at the same ship 3 or a different ship.<br>
The draft tubes of the turbine-generator units 2, with draft-tube closures 5 arranged thereon, are in the present example an integral part of the steel structure of the module. The draft-tube closures 5 may, as in this example, be assigned to a plurality of turbine-generator units 2.<br>
Furthermore, at this production site, which is remote from the site of use, if appropriate electrical switchgear 6, such as control units, power circuit breakers, compensation units, etc. which are fixed to the module are installed in the module 1. However, this electrical switchgear 6 may also be fitted at any other desired location, e.g. at the weir 11 at the site of use, and do not have to be integrated in the modules 1 at the production site of the modules 1.<br><br>
Furthermore, the modules I are provided, in the region of the turbine-generator units 2, at their upstream wide side, with a grate 7, in order to prevent flotsam and other solid materials from being able to enter the turbine-generator units 2, which could destroy the turbine-generator units 2. To allow this grate 7 to be cleaned, it is also possible for grate-cleaning machines, which have long been known and are not shown, to be arranged, so that the grate 7 can be cleaned automatically in operation.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a fully assembled module 1 having a multiplicity of turbine-generator units 2 and the grate 7, which is arranged at the end of a ship 3 ready for transport to the site of use, preferably in an upright position which corresponds to the operating position. It is preferably transported on the same waterway on which there is an existing weir 11 into which the module 1 is to be fitted.<br>
In this example, the module 1 has already been provided with sliding units 9, in this case rolling boxes, by means of which the module 1 can be raised and lowered along vertical guides in the weir 11. The module 1 is rigidly connected to the sliding units 9, for example by bolted connections.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the ship 3 with the module 1 which has arrived at the site of use, in this case a weir 11 with at least two piers 12. The ship 3 is then navigated in such a way that the module 1, preferably in its operating position, comes to stand upstream between two adjacent piers 12 of the weir 11. The ship 3 is preferably anchored in this position in order to allow safe working. At the weir 11 there is a lifting fixture 4 which is connected to the module 1.<br>
The piers 12 of the weir 11 have been prepared in advance to receive the module 1. For this purpose, vertical guides 8 have been provided at the piers 12,<br><br>
and the sliding units 9, such as for example a rolling box, can be guided movably in these guides. In many existing dams, guides 8 of this type are already present and can very advantageously be used without modification as guides 8 for the sliding units 9.<br>
The lifting device 4 then lifts the module 1 off the ship 3 and moves the module 1 into a position in which the sliding units 9 of the module 1 are inserted into the guides on both sides of the module 1. The guides 8 and the sliding units 9 may, of course, also be designed in such a way that there is no need for a lifting device 4 to insert them. The ship 3 then moves away from the weir 11 and clears the waterway for lowering of the module 1.<br>
In this example, the sliding units 9 have already been prefitted to the module 1 and the module 1 is moveably connected to the weir 11 via the sliding units 9 during its insertion into the weir 11. However, it is also conceivable for the sliding units 9 to have been prefitted in the guides 8 and for the module 1, at the site of use, simply to be lifted into a position between the piers 12 in order for the module 1 to be connected to the sliding units 9, in which case a rigid connection, e.g. by means of bolts, is then produced between module 1 and sliding units.<br>
In Fig. 4, the module 1 with the sliding units 9, in this case a rolling box, has already been mounted in the guides 8 and is in an upper, raised position. The space between module 1 and guide 8 or sliding units 9 is now also sealed so that water cannot flow through it, so that all the energy of the water can be utilized.<br>
The modules 1, which have now been fully assembled, can then be lowered into an operating position, i.e. a position in which the turbine-generator units 2 are<br>
arranged below the surface of the water and water can flow through them.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a weir 11 with a plurality of piers 12, with in each case one module 1 for obtaining electrical energy arranged between two adjacent piers. The modules 1 are all in their operating position.<br>
To allow the electrical energy obtained to be removed, the modules 1 are electrically connected to a power supply network 10, preferably with a transformer connected between them. The electrical energy obtained is therefore fed directly into a power supply network 10. Existing dams, such as in the present example a weir 11, can be additionally usefully exploited in this way. This method therefore represents an extremely ecologically and economically favorable way of obtaining energy.<br>
Before the module 1 is introduced into an operating position for the first time, it is, of course, possible to carry out any desired test, such as dry and wet tests or load tests, in order to be able to ensure the functionality of the module 1.<br>
Moreover, the modules 1 can also be connected to a central control unit, allowing central control of the energy production taking account of other aspects, such as for example predetermined minimum or maximum levels at the dam or operating states or levels of other power plants.<br>
Further necessary connections to the module 1, such as for example hydraulic lines, are also completed in the appropriate way before the module 1 is commissioned for the first time.<br><br><br><br><br>
