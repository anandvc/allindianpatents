				<td>DERIVATIVES OF N-PHENYLANTHRANILIC ACID AND 2-BENZIMIDAZOLONE AS POTASSIUM CHANNEL AND/OR CORTICAL<br>
NEURON ACTIVITY MODULATORS<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of pharmacology, and particularly to derivatives of N-phenylanthranilic acid and/or 2-benzimidazolone for the treatment of pathologies, especially pathologies related to potassium ion flux through voltage* dependent potassium channels and/or cortical neuron activity.<br>
Ion channels are cellular proteins that regulate the flow of ions, including calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride, into and out of cells. These channels are present in all animal cells and affect such processes as nerve transmission, muscle contraction and cellular secretion. Among the ion channels, potassium channels are the most ubiquitous and diverse, being found in a variety of animal cells such as nervous, muscular, glandular, immune, reproductive and epithelial tissue. These channels allow the flow of potassium in and/or out of the cell under certain conditions. For example, the outward flow of potassium ions upon opening of these channels makes the interior of the cell more negative, counteracting depolarizing voltages applied to the cell. These channels are regulated, e.g., by calcium sensitivity, voltage-gating, second messengers, extracellular ligands and ATP-sensitivity.<br>
Potassium channels have now been associated with a number of physiological processes, including regulation of heartbeat, dilation of arteries, release of insulin, excitability of nerve cells, and regulation of renal electrolyte transport. Potassium channels are made by alpha subunits that fall into at least 8 families, based on predicted structural and functional similarities (Wei et al^ Neuropharmacology 35(7): 805-829 (1997)). Three of these families (Kv, eag-related, and KQT) share a common motif of six transmembrane domains and are primarily gated by voltage. Two other families, CNG and SK/EK^ also contain this motif but are gated by cyclic nucleotides and calcium, respectively. The three other families of potassium channel alpha subunits have distinct patterns of transmembrane domains. Slo family potassium channels, or BK channels have seven transmembrane domains (Meera et aL7 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94(25): 14066-71 (1997)) and are gated by both voltage and calcium or pH (Schreiber et ai, J. Biol. Chem. 273: 3509-16 (1998)). Another family, the inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir), belongs to a structural family containing two<br><br>
transmembrane domains, and an eighth functionally diverse family (TT, or "two-pore11) contains two tandem repeats of this inward rectifier motif.<br>
Potassium channels are typically formed by four alpha subunits, and can be homomeric (made of identical alpha subunits) or heteromeric (made of two or more distinct types of alpha subunits). In addition, potassium channels made from Kv, KQT and Slo or BK subunits have often been found to contain additional, structurally distinct auxiliary, or beta, subunits. These subunits do not form potassium channels themselves, but instead they act as auxiliary subunits to modify the functional properties of channels formed by alpha subunits. For example, the Kv beta subunits are cytoplasmic and are known to increase the surface expression of Kv channels and/or modify inactivation kinetics of the channel (Heinemann et al, J. Physiol. 493: 625-633 (1996); Shi et al, Neuron 16(4): 843-852 (1996)). In another example, the KQT femily beta subunit, minK, primarily changes activation kinetics (Sanguinetti et al.9 Nature 384: 80-83 (1996)).<br>
Slo or BK potassium channels are large conductance potassium channels found in a wide variety of tissues, both in the central nervous system and periphery. They play a key role in the regulation of processes such as neuronal integration, muscular contraction and hormone secretion. They may also be involved in processes such as lymphocyte differentiation and cell proliferation, spermatocyte differentiation and sperm motility. Three alpha subunits of the Slo family have been cloned, i.e., Slol, Slo2, and Slo3 (Butler et ah, Science 261: 221-224 (1993); Schreiber et al.9 J. Biol. Chem., 273: 3509-16 (1998); and Joiner et al&gt; Nature Neurosci. 1: 462-469 (1998)). These Slo family members have been shown to be voltage and/or calcium gated, and/or regulated by intracellular pEL<br>
Certain members of the Kv family of potassium channels were recently renamed (see, Biervert, et aL9 Science 279: 403-406 (1998)). KvLQTl was re-named KCNQ1, and the KvLQTl-related channels (KvLRl and KvLR2) were renamed KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, respectively. More recently, additional members of the KCNQ subfamily were identified For example, KCNQ4 was identified as a channel expressed in sensory outer hair cells (Kubisch, et al, Cell 96(3): 437-446 (1999)). KCNQ5 (Kananura et a/., Neuroreport 11(9): 2063 (2000)), KCNQ2/3 (Main et al., MoL Pharmacol. 58: 253-62 (2000), KCNQ3/5 (Wickenden et aL, Br. J. Pharma 132: 381(2001)) and KCNQ6 have also recently been described<br><br>
KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 have been shown to be nervous system-specific potassium channels associated with benign familial neonatal convulsions ("BFNC"), a class of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (see, Leppert, et al., Nature 337: 647-648 (1989)). These channels have been linked to M-current channels (see, Wang, et ai, Science 282: 1890-1893 (1998)). The discovery and characterization of these channels and currents provides useful insights into how these voltage dependent (Kv) potassium channels function in different environments, and how they respond to various activation mechanisms. Such information has now led to the identification of modulators of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 potassium channels or the M-current, and the use of such modulators as therapeutic agents.<br>
A potassium channel opener that has gained much attention is retigabine (N-(2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl)carbamic acid ethyl ester). Retigabine was first described in European Patent No. 554,543. Compounds related to retigabine have also been proposed for use as potassium channel modulators, see for example U.S. Patent Application No. No. 10/022,579.<br>
Retigabine is highly selective for potassium channels consisting of the subunits KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. In addition, retigabine activates the homomultimerous channel, which contains only the subunit KCNQ2. Only marginal voltage-dependent currents are measurable in cells, which express only the homotneric channel from the KCNQ3 subunit, see U.S. 6,472,165.<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. No. 10/075,521 teaches 2,4-disubstituted pyrimidine-5-carboxamide derivatives as KCNQ potassium channel modulators.<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 10/160,582 teaches cinnamide derivatives as KCNQ potassium channel modulators.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,565,483 and U.S. Patent Application Nos. 10/312,123, 10/075,703 and 10/075,522 teach 3-substituted oxindole derivatives as KCNQ potassium channel modulators.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,384,330 teaches 1,2,4-triamino-benzene derivatives as KCNQ potassium channel modulators.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,593,349 teaches bisarylamines derivatives as KCNQ potassium channel modulators. The two aryl groups of the compounds taught in U.S. Patent No. 6,593,349 are a pyridine derivative and a five-membered heterocycle.<br><br>
A significant disadvantage of the KCNQ potassium channel modulators known in the art is that these are generally difficult to make, requiring complex multi-step syntheses and that in some cases these modulators are non-specific or even toxic.<br>
There is, hence, a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have new and effective potassium channel modulators that are readily available and easy to synthesize.<br>

In cases where the ester bond is an amide bond, the method according to this aspect of the present invention preferably further includes, prior to reacting with the hydroxyalkyl or the polyalkylene glycol, converting the N-phenylanthranilic acid or its derivative to a corresponding ester.<br>
As is demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the novel compounds of the present invention are easily and efficiently synthesized by the method of this aspect of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of the present invention include known compounds such as meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), diclofenac (Compound 2) and 1-EBIO (Compoimd 10). 1-EBIO (Compoimd 10) has been found to increase the opening rate and hence the open probability Po of the channel in single-channel studies performed on intermediate (DC) and small conductance (SK) Ca2+-activated K+ channel, see Syme et al Am. J. Physiol. 278:C570-C581 (2000).<br>
Compounds of the present invention also include novel compounds which are derivatives of N-phenylanthranilic acid, mainly derivatives of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and diclofenac (Compoimd 2). Exemplary novel compounds of the present invention are compounds 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.<br>
Herein it is demonstrated that these compounds are openers of KCNQ2/3 channel complex heterologously expressed in CHO cells. These compounds are also shown herein to reduce both evoked and spontaneous action potentials in cortical neurons.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have two main effects: shifting of the voltage dependence of KCNQ2/3 channel activation to more hyperpolarized potentials and slow channel deactivation. Similar to the effect on recombinant KCNQ2/3 channels, compounds 4, 5, 6 and 7 induce an approximately 20 mV negative shift in the threshold of M-current activation in cortical neurons, from -50 mV to -70 mV. As a result of this leftward shift of the KCNQ2/3 threshold of activation, there is a progressive hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. Without being bound to any theory in particular, the data presented herein in the Examples section that follows suggests that the compounds of the present invention either destabilize a<br><br>
closed channel conformation or stabilize the KCNQ2/3 channel in an open state. Further, exposure of channels to the compounds described herein also leads to a slowing of deactivation that contributes to the stabilization of the KCNQ2/3 channel in the open state. Without being bound to any theory in particular, it is possible that the compounds of the present invention modify the channel gating by shifting the voltage dependence of the voltage sensor S4 movement in the hyperpolarizing direction.<br>
From a functional point of view, the leftward shift in the voltage dependence and the slowing of deactivation, caused by the compounds of the present invention, leads to substantial M-current activation at normal resting and subthreshold potentials. The especially large activation of KCNQ2/3 channels, e.g., in the case of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) at potentials around —60/-50 mV (more than 10-fold increase in KCNQ2/3 current amplitude), shows that the compounds of the present invention cause membrane hyperpolarization. In addition, since the M-current (KCNQ2/3) is non-inactivating, its marked activation by compounds of the present invention contributes to a significant steady-state potassium conductance at subthreshold and threshold potentials, acting as brake for neuronal firing. Indeed, it is also demonstrated that compounds of the present invention depress the evoked and spontaneous cortical neurons activity.<br>
It is important to note that the voltage range through which compounds of the present invention activate KCNQ2/3 channels makes theses compounds exceptionally useful for the treatment of ischemic stroke.<br>
There are similarities between the properties exhibited by the compounds of the present invention and retigabine.<br>
First, both the compounds of the present invention and retigabine all shift the voltage dependence of KCNQ2/3 channel activation leftwards, decelerating deactivation kinetics and hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential (for retigabine discussed, for example, in Tatulian et al J. Neurosci. 21: 5535-5545 (2001)).<br>
Second, retigabine produces a secondary inhibitory action on KCNQ channels at positive potentials (above +20 mV, Tatulian et al J. Neurosci. 21: 5535-5545 (2001)) as do the compounds of the present invention towards KCNQ2/3 channels.<br>
An interesting difference between retigabine and the compounds of the present invention is related to the selectivity towards the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits. While retigabine exerts the strongest opener action on KCNQ3 homomeric channels (Tatulian<br><br>
et al J. Neurosci. 21: 5535-5545 (2001), it is shown herein that the compounds of the present invention are more potent on KCNQ2 homomeric channels<br>
From a functional point of view, the leftward shift of the activation curve and the slowing of deactivation, produced by the compounds of the present invention, leads to substantial M-current activation at normal resting and subthreshold potentials. In addition, since the M-current (KCNQ2/3) is non-inactivating, activation by the compounds of the present invention is expected to contribute to a significant steady-state potassium conductance at subthreshold and threshold potentials, acting as a brake for neuronal firing. Indeed, compounds 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 depress the evoked and spontaneous cortical neuron activity.<br>
The voltage range through which the compounds of the present invention operate, indicates exceptionally suitability for the treatment of epilepsy, ischemic stroke and neuropathic pain.<br>

amount means an amount of active ingredient effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate a condition and/or symptoms thereof and/or effects thereof.<br>
Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br>
For any preparation used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC^Q as determined in cell culture. Such<br>
information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the IC^Q and the LD50 (lethal dose causing death in 50 %<br>
of the tested animals) for a subject compound. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition, (See e.g., Fingl, et al., 1975, in "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1 p.l).<br>
Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the kinase modulating effects, termed the minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each preparation, but can be estimated from in vitro data; e.g., the concentration necessary to achieve 50-90 % inhibition of a kinase may be ascertained using the assays described herein. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.<br>
Dosage intervals can also be determined using the MEC value. Preparations should be administered using a regimen, which maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90 % of the time, preferable between 30-90 % and most preferably 50-90 %.<br><br>
It is noted that, in the case of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration. In such cases, other procedures known in the art can be employed to determine the effective local concentration.<br>
Depending on the severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated, dosing can also be a single administration of a slow release composition, with course of treatment lasting from several days to several weeks or xmtil cure is effected or diminution of the disease state is achieved.<br>
The amount of a composition to be administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.<br>

The culture medium consisted of Modified Eagle's Medium containing 5% horse serum (Biological Industries, Beit HaEmek, Israel), B-27 neuronal supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 fig/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. D-Glucose was supplemented to a final concentration of 6 g/1. Cytosine-1-D-arabinofuranoside (5 yM) was added after 5 days to arrest glial cell proliferation. All cultures were maintained at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2.<br>
Electrophysiology:<br>
For current measurements in CHO cells, recordings were performed 40 h following transfection, using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (Hamill et al.y Nature 294: 462-464 (1981)). Signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA), sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 800 Hz via a 4-pole Bessel low pass filter. Data were acquired using pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA) and an Elonex Pentium m computer in conjunction with a DigiData 1322A interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA)- The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, Connecticut, USA) with a resistance of 2-5 MQ and were filled with (in mM): 130 KC1, 1 MgCl2, 5 K2ATP, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted with KOH at pH 7.4 (290 mOsm). The external solution contained (in [mM]): 140 NaCl, 4 KC1, 1.8 CaCl2, L2 MgCl2, 11 glucose, 5.5 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH at pH 7.4 (310 mOsm). Series resistances (3-13 MO) were compensated (75-90%) and periodically monitored. For current-clamp measurements of rat cortical neurons, recordings were performed 10-14 days after plating. The patch<br><br>
pipettes were filled with (in [mM] ): 135 KCl, 1 K2ATP, 1 MgATP, 2 EGTA, 1.1 CaCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted with KOH at pH 7.4 (315 mOsm). The external solution contained (in [mM] ): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH at pH 7.4 (325 mOsm). For evoking the neuronal action potentials, 50-300 pA currents were injected into the cells for 800 ms (square pulse). Recordings were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 KHz via a 4-pole Bessel low pass filter. For voltage-clamp measurements of rat cortical neurons, the patch pipettes were filled with (in mM): 90 K-acetate, 40 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 2 K2ATP, 20 HEPES, adjusted with KOH at pH 7.4 (310-315 mOsm), The external solution contained (in mM): 120 NaCl, 23 NaHC03, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCi2, 11 glucose, 0.0005 tetrodotoxin (TTX), 5 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH at pH 7.4 (325 mOsm.<br>
Current measurements in Xenopus oocytes were performed as described in the art (Peretz et al J, Physiol 545:751-766 (2002)). Briefly, two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed 3-5 days following cRNA microinjection into oocytes. Oocytes were bathed in a modified ND96 solution containing (in mM: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2 and 5 HEPES titrated to pH - 7.4 with NaOH). Whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature (20°C-22°C) using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA). Glass microelectrodes (A-M Systems, Inc., Carlsborg, Wisconsin, USA) were filled with 3M KCl and had tip resistances of 0.5-1.5 M£X Stimulation of the preparation, data acquisition and analyses were performed using the pCLAMP 6.02 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA) and a 586 personal computer Pentium 4 interfaced with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA)- Current signals were filtered at 0.5 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz.<br>
Data analyses:<br>
Data analysis was performed using the Clampfit program (pClamp 8.1, Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA), Microsoft Excel 98 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, USA), Axograph 4.6 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA) and Prism 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, California, USA). Leak subtraction was performed off-line, using the Clampfit program of the pClamp 8.1 software. To analyze the KCNQ2/3 channel deactivation, a single exponential fit was applied to the tail currents. Chord conductance (G) was calculated by using the equation:<br><br>
G = I/(V-Vrev)<br>
where I corresponds to the current amplitude measured at the end of the pulse and Vrev, the calculated reversal potential assumed to be -90 mV in CHO cells and -98 mV in Xenopus oocytes. G was estimated at various test voltages V and then, normalized to a maximal conductance value, GmaX5 calculated at +40 mV. Activation curves were fitted by a Boltzmann distribution-.<br>
G/GIMx=l/{l+exp[(V5o-V)/s]}<br>
where V50 is the voltage at which the current is half-activated and s is the slope factor. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistically significant differences were assessed by Student's *-test.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS<br>
Assays conducted with meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), diclofenac (Compound 2) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10)<br>
EXAMPLE 1 The effect of Meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) on the<br>
KCNQ2/3 current<br>
The leftwards-shift of the voltage dependence of activation of the KCNQ2/3 current induced by Meclofenamic acid (1) and 1-EBIO (10) is discussed with reference to Figures 1A-1D.<br>
When KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits are expressed separately as homomeric channels in various expression systems, they give rise to relatively small potassium currents, especially for KCNQ3 (Wang et al Science 282: 1890-1893 (1998) and Yang et al J. Biol. Chem. 273: 19419-19423 (1998)). However, KCNQ2 co-expressed with KCNQ3 produces a current whose amplitude is about 10 times that of the sum of the two homomeric channels and whose biophysical and pharmacological properties are very similar to those of the native M-current (Main et al. Mol.<br><br>
Pharmacol. 58: 253-262 (2000), Wang et al Science 282: 1890-1893 (1998) and Yang et al L Biol. Chem. 273: 19419-19423 (1998)).<br>
CHO cells were co-transfected with the two corresponding cDNAs of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 at an equimolar ratio and exposed to meclofenamic acid (1) and 1-EBIO (10) so as to identify the effect of these compounds on M-current.<br>
Turning to Figures 1A and IB, representative traces were recorded from the same cell before (left panel) and after (right panel) external application of 100 pM meclofenamic acid (Compound 1, Figure 1A) and 100 }iM 1-EBIO (Compound 10, Figure IB). The membrane potential was stepped from -70 mV to +40 mV for 1.5 second pulse duration, in 10 mV increments, followed by 0.75 second pulse to -60 mV, producing the tail current. The holding potential of all experiments was -85 mV.<br>
The normalized conductance (G/GmaX) was plotted as a function of the voltage steps, for the control (open squares) and meclofenamic acid (Compound 1, Figure 1C) or 1-EBIO (Compound 10, Figure ID) treated cells (solid square). The activation curves were fitted using the Boltzmann distribution.<br>
Figure 1A (left panel) shows representative traces of the KCNQ2/3 current activated by step depolarization above a voltage threshold of about -50 mV. Addition of 100 pM meclofenamic acid externally shown in Figure 1A (right panel) produced a pronounced leftward shift of 22.7 mV in the voltage-dependence of KCNQ2/3 current activation, from V50 = -19.65 ± 1.85 mV (n = 24) to V50 = -42.34 ± 2.08 mV (n = 14). The slope parameter of the Boltzmann fitting curve, did not change significantly with s = -9.46 ± 0.41 mV/e fold and s = -10.50 ± 0.93 mV/e fold, for control and meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), respectively.<br>
In Figure IB (right panel) the leftward shift caused by 100 pM 1-EBIO (Compound 10) of 7.9 mV (p
Consequently, upon exposure to meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) or 1-EBIO (Compound 10) the KCNQ2/3 current activated at more hyperpolarized potentials above a voltage threshold of about -60 mV versus -50 mV for control (Figures 1C and<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 Augmentation of the KCN02/3 current amplitude by Meclofenamic acid<br>
(Compound 1) and l-EBIO (Compound 10)<br>
The augmentation of the KCNQ2/3 current amplitude by meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and l-EBIO (Compound 10) is discussed with reference to Figures 1A-1D and Figures 2A-2C.<br>
As is shown in Figure 2A, the KCNQ2/3 current increases in the presence of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and l-EBIO (Compound 10). Traces were recorded in the absence (control) and presence of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1, left panel) or l-EBIO (Compound 10, right panel). The cells were stepped to -20 mV for 1.5 second pulse duration. In this train protocol, the interval between the pulses was 30 seconds.<br>
Figure 2B shows the percentages of the current measured in the presence (+) or absence (-) of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1, left panel) or l-EBIO (Compound 10, right panel), where the control is 100 %.<br>
In Figure 2C, the current amplitude (nA) was plotted against the step voltage, in the hyperpolarized potential range (-70 mV to -20 mV) to emphasize the negative shift of the threshold for channel activation, in response to meclofenamic acid (Compound 1, left panel) or l-EBIO (Compound 10, right panel) application,<br>
Within about one minute of external application of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) a large increase in KCNQ2/3 current amplitude across a range of test potentials between -50 to 0 mV was observed (Figure 1C and Figure 2A, left panel). The effect of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) was fully reversible (data not shown). In the train protocol, when the cells were stepped to -20 mV the application of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) induced an increase of the current amplitude by up to 72 %, from 844 ± 130 pA to 1451 ± 164 pA (n = 15), for control and meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), respectively (Figure 2B, left panel). From the normalized conductance-voltage relation (G/Gmax) and the normalized current-voltage relation (I/Imax) presented in Figures 1C and 2C, respectively, one can see that meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) increased KCNQ2/3 potassium current primarily via a leftward shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation. As the test potentials became more positive and approached saturation values of the activation curve (z.e, +20 mV), the effects of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) on KCNQ2/3 current amplitude<br><br>
oecame very small. Clearly, the most pronounced action of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) was exerted at negative physiologically relevant potentials. At -50 mV, -40 mV and -30 mV, meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) increased KCNQ2/3 current amplitude by more than 10-fold, 5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively (Figures 1A, 1C and 2C, left panels).<br>
Similarly, addition of 100 jxM 1-EBIO (Compound 10) quickly led to an increase in KCNQ2/3 current amplitude across a range of test potentials between -50 to -10 mV (Figure IB, Figure 2A and Figure 2B, right panels), although the effect was less pronounced than the effect of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1). The effect of 1-EBIO (Compound 10) was fully reversible (data not shown). In the train protocol, when the cells were stepped to -30 mV the application of 1-EBIO (Compound 10) induced an increase of the current amplitude by up to 57 %, from 945 ± 135 pA (n -14) to 1483 ± 194 (n = 14), for control and 1-EBIO (Compound 10), respectively. From the normalized conductance-voltage relation (G/GmaX) and the normalized current-voltage relation (I/Imax) presented in figures ID and 2C, right panel, respectively, one can see that 1-EBIO (Compound 10) increased KCNQ2/3 potassium current primarily via a leftward shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation. As the test potentials became more positive and approached the saturation values of the activation curve, the effects of 1-EBIO (Compound 10) on KCNQ2/3 current amplitude became weaker. Figure ID shows the leftward shift of the threshold for channel activation of about 10 mV. In addition, Figure 2C, right panel shows that the most pronounced action of 1-EBIO (Compound 10) was exerted at negative physiologically relevant potentials. At -50 mV and -40 mV, 1-EBIO (Compound 10) increases the KCNQ2/3 current amplitude by more than 10-fold and 3-fold, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 The effect of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) on<br>
KCNQ2/3 deactivation kinetics<br>
The slowing down of KCNQ2/3 deactivation kinetics caused by meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) is discussed with reference to Figures 3A-3E.<br><br>
In Figure 3A the tail current of a cell before (control) and following application of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) is shown. The prepulse was -20 mV while the tail potential was -60 mV;<br>
In Figure 3B the time constant resulting from the exponential fit of the tail current decay (xdeact), in the absence (-) and the presence of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) (+) is depicted.<br>
Although meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) did not affect the KCNQ2/3 activation kinetics, they markedly slowed down the deactivation process. The decay of the tail current or deactivation reflects the transition of the channel from the open state to the close state. As seen in Figure 3 A, the cells were depolarized to -20 mV and then repolarized to -60 mV. The decay of the tail current was fitted using one exponential function. In response to the addition of 100 \iM meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), the time constant for deactivation increased by about 2-fold, from tdeaci= 79.6 ± 4.5 msec to Tdeact= 167.5 ± 11.6 msec (n = 10). The results are highly significant, as shown in Figure 3B and Figure 3C.<br>
As noted above, 1-EBIO (Compound 10) did affect significantly (pO.OOl) the KCNQ2/3 deactivation kinetics. The decay of the tail current was fitted using one exponential function. In response to the addition of 100 fiM 1-EBIO (Compound 10), the time constant for deactivation increased from Xdcact = 91.2 ± 8.4 msec to Tdeact = 110.1 ± 9.5 msec (n = 14, Figure 3E). Figure 3D shows that 1-EBIO (Compound 10) slows down the deactivation kinetics of KCNQ2/3 channels.<br>
EXAMPLE4 Inhibition of evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity by meclofenamic acid<br>
(Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10)<br>
The inhibition of evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity by meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) is discussed with reference to Figures 4A-4B.<br>
In Figures 4A-4B neuronal activity depression by meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) is shown. In Figure 4A, evoked rat cortical neuronal activity before (first row) during (second and third rows) and after (fourth and fifth rows) application<br><br>
of different meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) concentrations. Each column corresponds to a different neuron.<br>
In Figure 4B, spontaneous activity recorded before, during and after 10 \xM meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) application is depicted.<br>
As discussed hereinabove, one of the main functions of the M-current is monitoring the excitability of neurons in the brain. From the result above, it is clear that meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) enhance the heterologously expressed M-current. The question remains how meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) modulate the excitability of neurons expressing the M-current. To answer this question, a primary culture of rat cortical neurons and the current clamp configuration of the patch clamp technique were used.<br>
First, how meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and 1-EBIO (Compound 10) affect the evoked action potential activity of the rat cortical neurons was studied. In Figure 4A it is seen that the evoked potentials are reversibly inhibited by meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), in the range of 5-20 jxM. Each lane of Figure 4A is recorded from a different neuron, using the current-clamp configuration of the patch-clamp technique.<br>
Second, it is seen that the spontaneous activity of the rat cortical neurons is completely but reversibly inhibited by 10 \iM meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), Figure 4B.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Protection of mice from seizures produced by electroshock using meclofenamic acid<br>
(Compound 1)<br>
The effect of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) in protecting mice from electroshock induced seizures is discussed with reference to Figure 5.<br>
Five groups of 10 ICR mice each received intraperitoneally saline or meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) at 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg and were subjected 30 minutes later to an electric shock (50 mA, 0.2 second duration, 60 Hz). The relative fraction of mice that did not produce seizures was plotted for each dose in Figure 5.<br>
In view of the strong depressing activity of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) on cortical neurons, the anticonvulsant activity in mice subjected to seizures produced<br><br>
by electroshock was examined Meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) dissolved in saline was injected intraperitoneally (in a volume of 10 ml/kg) at doses ranging from 25 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg to ICR adult mice and its anticonvulsant activity was compared with saline. Thirty minutes after drug administration, seizures were produced by electroshock (50 mA, 0.2 second duration, 60 Hz). Figure 5 shows that 50 mg/kg meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) significantly protected 50% of the mice from electroshock and at 100 mg/kg folly prevented seizures. At 150 mg/kg meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) led to sedation of the mice.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The effect of diclofenac (Compound 2) on the voltage dependence activation of the<br>
KCNQ2/3 current and the deactivation ofKCNQ2/3 current<br>
The leftwards-shift of the voltage dependence of activation of the KCNQ2/3 current induced by diclofenac (Compound 2) is discussed with reference to Figures 6A-6C.<br>
In Figures 6A-6C the enhancement of the KCNQ2/3 current caused by diclofenac (Compound 2) is shown. In Figure 6A whole cell currents of KCNQ2/3 heterogously expressed in CHO cells recorded before and after perfusion of 50 |JM diclofenac are shown. In Figure 6A the cell membrane was stepped from -90 mV to -50 mV (1 second) followed by tail step to -60 mV (0.75 second). Recordings were taken every 30 seconds. In Figure 6B the percentage of the current presented in the presence (+) or absence (-) of diclofenac, where the control is 100%, taken from the experiment presented in Figure 6A is shown. In Figure 6C the normalized conductance (G/Gmax) is plotted as a function of the voltage steps, for the control (open squares) and diclofenac (closed squares), for KCNQ2/3 current<br>
In Figure 6Cr the addition of 50 pM diclofenac (Compound 2) induced a leftward shift of-14.5 mV in the voltage-dependence of KCNQ2/3 activation, from V50 = -30.9 ± 4.1 mV to V50 = -45.4 ± 2.7 mV (n = 7,p 
In Figure 6C, it is seen that as with meclofenamic acid (Compound 1), treatment of CHO cells with diclofenac (Compound 2) slowed down the deactivation kinetics of KCNQ2/3 channels<br>
In Figures 6A and 6B it is seen that the KCNQ2/3 current amplitude is increased by diclofenac (2) at physiologically relevant potentials. In a train protocol,<br><br>
when the cells were stepped from -85 rnV to -50 mV the application of diclofenac (Compound 2) induced an increase of the current amplitude by up to 262 ±26 % (n =<br>
The effects of diclofenac (Compound 2) were fully reversible (data not shown).<br>
In general, these effects of both meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and diclofenac (Compound 2) appear to result from a stronger impact of the openers on KCNQ2 than on KCNQ3 channel subunits, as is demonstrated in Example 7 below.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 Selectivity of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) action<br>
The opener properties of meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and diclofenac on heteromeric KCNQ2/Q3 channels raise the question of whether these compounds act equally well or more selectively on either subunit. To address this problem, the effect of 50 jiM meclofenamic acid on homomeric KCNQ2 channels and homomeric KCNQ3 expressed separately in CHO cells was tested. The results are presented in Figures 16A-D.<br>
As is shown in Figure 16C, it was found that meclofenamic acid generally exerted a stronger action on KCNQ2 than on KCNQ3 channels as it produced a substantial leftward shift of -26.9 mV in the activation curve of KCNQ2 channels, from V50 = -23.6 ± 2.2 mV (n = 8) to V50 = -50.5 ± 1.4 mV (n = 5) in control and meclofenamic acid-treated cells, respectively (Figure 16C left panel, p 
Meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) significantly reduced the speed of KCNQ2 channel closure with the time constant of deactivation increasing from Tdeact ~ 92.6 ± 3.9 msec to tdeact = 152.7 ± 4.9 msec (Figures 16A and 16D; n- = 8, p 
 <br>
Reflecting the stronger effect of the opener on KCNQ2 versus KCNQ3 channels, the application of 50 pM meclofenamic acid produced an increase of 240 ± 26 % and 120 ± 4 % of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 current amplitudes, respectively, when the cells were stepped from -85 mV to -40 mV (Figures 16A and B; n = 8, p
Interestingly, homomeric KCNQ1 and heteromeric KCNQl/KCNEl currents were not enhanced by 50 fiM diclofenac or 50pM meclofenamic acid across a range of test potentials between -50 to 0 mV (data not shown)- Instead, both openers reduced the current amplitude at positive potentials (from 0 mV to 40 mV).<br>
Assays conducted with Compounds 3-9<br>
Novel Compounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were tested for KCNQ2/3 opening activity as is described below. It is important to note that compounds 3-9 were also tested and found to have no effect on KCNQl/KCNEl cardiac channels and displayed a selective brain specificity. These results are not shown.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 The effect of Compound 6 on KCNQ2/3 channels and on rat cortical neurons<br>
The effect of Compound 6 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 potassium channels heterogously expressed in CHO cells and on rat cortical neurons is discussed with reference to Figures 7A-7C, Figures 8A-8B and Figures 9A-9C.<br>
In Figures 7A-7C the effects of Compound 6 on KCNQ2/3 currents are shown. In Figure 7 A whole-cell currents recorded before and after perfusion of 25 pM Compound 6 are shown. In Figure 7B the percentage of the current presented in the presence (+) or absence (-) of Compound 6, where the control is 100%, taken from the experiment presented in Figure 7A. In Figure 7C the normalized conductance (G/Gmax) was plotted as a function of the voltage steps, for the control (open squares) and Compound 6 (closed squares), for KCNQ2/3 current are shown.<br>
In Figures 8A-8B inhibition of the evoked neuronal activity by the Compound 6 is shown. In Figure 8A neuronal activity, as evoked by square depolarizing current, inhibited by lOpM Compound 6 and recovered after wash is shown. In Figure 8A the depolarizing current was 50 pA for 800 msec. In Figure 8B the evoked neuronal activity, using the ramp protocol, recorded before, after external perfusion of<br><br>
Compound 6 and recovered after wash is shown. In the ramp protocol depicted in Figure 8B, the depolarizing current was ramped from 0 pA to 300 pA within 800 msec.<br>
In Figures 9A-9C inhibition of the spontaneous neuronal activity by different concentration of Compound 6 is shown. Shown is spontaneous activity recorded before, after addition and after wash of Compound 6, for 20pM in Figure 9 A, for lOpM in Figure 9B and 5pM in Figure 9C.<br>
Figure 7C shows the effects of 25 pM Compound 6 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 channels expressed in CHO cells. As with meclofenamic acid (Compound 1) and diclofenac (2), when externally applied Compound 6 produced a significant leftward shift of -13 mV in the voltage-dependence of KCNQ2/3 activation, from V50 = -30.9 ± 4.1 mV to V5o = -43.45 ± 2.3 mV (n = 7, pO.Ol).<br>
In Figure 7A it is seen that Compound 6 also slowed down the deactivation kinetics of KCNQ2/3 channels.<br>
In Figures 7A and 7B it is seen that the KCNQ2/3 current amplitude was increased by Compound 6 at physiologically relevant potentials. In a train protocol, when the cells were stepped from —85 mV to -50 mV the application of 25 pM Compound 6 induced an increase of the current amplitude by up to 220% (n = 10).<br>
The effect of Compound 6 was reversible (data not shown).<br>
As one of the main functions of the M-current is to dampen the neuronal spiking discharges, what the effect of Compound 6 on the evoked and spontaneous action potential activity of cultured rat cortical neurons was examined. Using the current-clamp configuration of the patch clamp technique, the effects of Compound 6 on neuronal action potentials evoked either by a squared pulse (Figure 8A; 50-300 pA, 800 msec) or a ramp (Figure 8B; 0-300 pA in 800 msec) of depolarizing current were examined. The resting membrane potential was close to -60 mV and, when needed, was maintained at this level by injecting DC current Superfusion of 10 pM Compound 6 reduced drastically and reversibly the number of evoked action potentials in cortical neurons. Within less than one minute following external superfusion of 10 jiM Compound 6, the cortical neurons fired action potentials with a widening of interspike interval (Figure 8A, 2nd row). After 2 minutes of opener exposure, only one spike could be evoked by the same depolarizing current (Figure 8A&gt; 3rd row). Thus, Compound 6 consistently reduced the number of evoked action potentials. Upon<br><br>
washout of the Compound for less than 2 minutes, neurons recovered their initial spiking activity (Figure 8A, 5th row).<br>
Similar results were obtained with ramp currents depicted in Figure 8B.<br>
Using higher density cultures of rat cortical neurons, spontaneous spiking activity was recorded (Figures 9). Compound 6 dose-dependently (5 |iM - 20 pM) produced within less than 2 minutes a profound depression of spontaneous action potentials. The depressing action of Compound 6 could be reversed by washout of the Compound 6 Compound for all three concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 The effect of Compound 5 on KCNQ2/3 channels and on rat cortical neurons<br>
The effect of Compound 5 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 potassium channels heterogously expressed in CHO cells and on rat cortical neurons is discussed with reference to Figures 10A-IOC.<br>
In Figures 10A-IOC the effects of Compound 5 on the neuronal activity and KCNQ2/3 current is shown. In Figure 10A, evoked rat cortical neuronal activity recorded before, after application of 25pM Compound 53 and after washing is shown. In Figure 10B KCNQ2/3 currents recorded before (upper panel) and after (lower panel) application of 25liM Compound 5. In Figure 10B, the cell membrane was stepped from -80 mV to -40 mV in 10 mV increments (holding potential = -90 mV). In Figure 10C the normalized conductance (G/Gmax) was plotted as a function of the voltage steps, for the control (open squares) and Compound 5 (closed squares).<br>
From Figures 10A-10C it is seen that Compound 5 has KCNQ2/3 potassium channels opening properties similar to those of Compound 6.<br>
In Figure 10C it is seen that-25 pM Compound 5 produced a significant leftward shift of ~8 mV in the voltage-dependence of KCNQ2/3 activation, from V50 — -30.9 ±4.1mV to V50 = -383 ±1.9mV(n= 5, p
In Figure 10B it is seen that Compound 5 slowed down the deactivation kinetics of KCNQ2/3 channels. It is also seen that 15 \xM Compound 5 enhances the current amplitude at the physiologically relevant potentials of-40 and -50 riiV.<br>
In Figure 10A it is also seen that superfusion of 25 pM Compound 5 reversibly inhibited the number of evoked action potentials in cortical neurons.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 10 The effect of Compound 3 on KCNQ2/3 channels<br>
The effect of Compound 3 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 potassium channels heterogously expressed in CHO cells is discussed with reference to Figures 11A-11B.<br>
In Figures 11A-11B the KCNQ2/3 current increase in the presence of Compound 3 is shown. In Figure 11A are shown currents in the absence (control) and presence of 25 \lM Compound 3. In Figure 11 A, the cells were stepped to -50 mV for 1.5 second pulse duration and the interval between the pulses was 30 second. In Figure 1 IB the percentage of the current presented in the presence (+) or absence (-) of Compound 3, where the control is 100%, is shown.<br>
In Figures 11 A-1 IB it is seen that Compound 3 has potent KCNQ2/3 potassium channel opening properties at 25 ^M. In a train protocol, when the cells were stepped from -85 mV to -50 mV the application of 25 \iM Compound 3 induced an increase of the current amplitude by up to 299 ± 47 % (n = 6; p 
The effect of Compound 3 was fully reversible (data not shown).   .<br>
EXAMPLE 11 The effect of Compound 4 on KCNQ2/3 channels and on rat cortical neurons<br>
The effect of Compound 4 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 potassium channels heterologously expressed in CHO cells and on rat cortical neurons is discussed with reference to Figures 12A-12C.<br>
In Figures 12A-12C, the effects of Compound 4 on neuronal activity and KCNQ2/3 current are shown. In Figure 12A KLCNQ2/3 currents recorded before (left panel) and after (right panel) application of 50pM Compound 4 are shown. The cell membrane was stepped from -80 mV to -40 mV in 10 mV increments (holding potential = -90 mV). In Figure 12B spontaneous cortical neuron activity recorded before, after addition of 20 pM Compound 4 and after a wash is shown. In Figure 12D the normalized conductance (G/Gmax) was plotted as a function of the voltage steps, for the control (open squares) and Compound 4 (closed squares).<br>
In Figures 12A-12C it is evident that Compound 4 is a potent KCNQ2/3 channel opener. As seen in Figure 12A when CHO cells were stepped from -85 mV to -50 mV and -^40 mV, the application of 50 pM Compound 4 induced an increase of the current amplitude by more than 4-fold and  1.5-fold, respectively, as discussed<br><br>
hereinabove for Compound 3. This increase in KCNQ2/3 current amplitude results from the leftward shift produced by Compound 4 on the voltage-dependent curve of activation, Figure 12C<br>
In Figure 12B it is seen that when applied to rat cortical neurons, 20 \iM Compound 4 markedly depressed the spontaneous spiking activity. As seen in Figure 12B, the effect of Compound 4 was fully reversible.<br>
EXAMPLE 12 Tlte effect of Compound 9 on KCNQ2/3 channels and on rat cortical neurons<br>
The effect of Compound 9 on rat cortical neurons is discussed with reference to Figure 13. In Figure 13 is shown spontaneous neuronal activity (action potentials) as modulated by 20 pM Compound 9.<br>
As seen in Figure 13, and in contrast to other molecules of the present invention, 20 pM of Compound 9 exhibit an inhibitory activity on evoked and spontaneous spiking activity of cortical neurons. However, in contrast to other molecules of the present invention, Compound 9 displayed only a weak opener action on recombinant KCNQ2/3 channels heterologously expressed in CHO cells. This result suggests that Compound 9 exerts neuronal depressant activity via mechanisms that do not involve K.CNQ2/3 channels.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 The effect of Compound 7 on KCNQ2/3 channels and on rat cortical neurons<br>
The effect of Compound 7 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 potassium channels heterologously expressed in CHO cells and on rat cortical neurons is discussed with reference to Figures 14A-14D.<br>
In Figures 14A-14D the effects of 20 pM Compound 7 on KCNQ2/3 channels and neuronal activity are shown. In Figure 14A the KCNQ2/3 whole cell currents recorded before and after perfusion of 20 pM Compound 7 are shown. In Figurel4B the percentage of the current presented in the presence (+) or absence (-) of Compound 7, where the control is 100%, taken from the experiment presented in Figure 14A. In Figure 14C, the normalized conductance of the KCNQ2/3 current (G/Gmax) is plotted as a function of the voltage steps, for the control (open squares)<br><br>
and Compound 7 (closed squares). In Figure 14D is shown the modulation of spontaneous neuronal activity (action potentials) by 20 JJM Compound 7.<br>
Figure 14 shows the effects of Compound 7 on KCNQ2/3 channels. As with compounds 6 and 5 (discussed hereinabove), Compound 7 is a potent KCNQ2/3 channel opener with a marked leftward shift in the voltage dependent activation curve (Figure 14C). This effect led to a potent increase of the channel amplitude as determined by a train protocol (Figures 14A and 14B). Likewise, 20 \iM Compound 7 exhibited a very potent inhibitory activity on evoked and spontaneous spiking activity of cortical neurons (Figure 14D). This effect was fully reversible.<br>
EXAMPLE 14 The effect of Compound 8 on KCN02/3 channels and on rat cortical neurons<br>
The effect of Compound 8 on recombinant KCNQ2/3 potassium channels heterologously expressed in CHO cells and on rat cortical neurons is discussed with reference to Figures 15A-15B.<br>
In Figures 15A-15B, the evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity as modulated by Compound 8 is shown. In Figure 15A, is shown evoked rat cortical neuronal activity recorded before, during and after application of lOpM Compound 8. In Figure 15B the spontaneous neuronal activity (action potentials) as modulated by 5 pM Compound 8 is shown.<br>
Figures 15A-B show that low concentrations of Compound 8 produced a potent inhibitory activity on evoked and spontaneous spiking activity of cortical neurons. However, like Compound 9 discussed hereinabove, Compound 8 displayed only a weak opener action of recombinant KCNQ2/3 channels heterologously expressed in CHO cells. This result suggests that Compound 8 exerts neuronal depressant activity via mechanisms that do not involve KCNQ2/3 channels.<br>
