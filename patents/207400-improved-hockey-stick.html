IMPROVED HOCKEY STICK<br>
This invention relates to an improved hockey stick and, in particular but not exclusively, to hockey sticks intended for outfield players.<br>
A traditional form of hockey stick is made up of four portions, namely a handle, a shaft, a head and a toe. The handle typically extends for the upper three fifths or sc of the stick. The shaft typically occupies the majority of the remaining lower two fifths of the stick and merges at its lower end with the head. The head typically occupies only a small proportion of the vertical dimension at the base of the sticks but the bulk of the horizontal dimension. The head terminates in a generally upwardly directed toe portion.<br>
The allowable playing surface or "face" of the stick is the front, predominantly flat area of the stick which is presented forwardly with the toe provided on the right haÂ£
In this Specification,  various terms are used describe  the  shape  and geometry  of  a  hockey slick References to vertical, brisontal, rearward, forward etc<br>
refer to the stick when viewed in the orientation of figure<br>
i       <br>
1 of the accompanying drawings, that is on the back of the<br>
stick, with the axes of the handle and shaft generally<br><br>
vertical, with the toe pointing away from the player (ie. forwardly) . Thus a forward curve or inclination is an anticlockwise angular displacement when the stick is viewed in<br><br>
2<br>
the orientation of Figure 1.<br>
Playing on the open stick means playing the stick forehand in the usual attitude with the toe of the stick pointing away from the player, and the bulk of the stick on the player's right hand side; playing on the reverse stick means playing the stick backhand with the stick flipped through 1800 about the axis of the handle, so that the toe is nearest the ground and the bulk of the stick lies on the player's left hand side. At present all sticks are right-handed but the invention extends to left-handed versions (i.e. substantially mirror images of left-handed sticks) and the terminology herein is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
A reverse stick block is when the stick is held on the reverse stick side with the free end of the toe'in contact with the ground, and the shaft extending generally parallel to the ground.<br>
As a professional coach, I have analysed the features<br>
of existing sticks and also, the dynamics of the strategy of<br>
the game itself.  I have found chat a player's skill and<br>
ball control can be considerably improved if the hockey<br>
stick is re-designed to provide the unusual and innovative<br>
feature of an extended elongate playing area in the region<br>
of the head and/or shaft of the stick, which extended area<br>
allows a player to slide and propel the hockey ball to<br>
impart  substantial  acceleration  or  deceleration  and<br>
potential lift to the ball. . This feature, with suitable<br>
training, can help generate enhanced pace, accuracy and<br>
deception  in  passing  and  drag-flicking.    Something<br><br>
.3<br>
approaching this effect can be produced by expert players with certain traditional sticks, but only whilst placing the knuckles practically on the ground surface and only when exhibiting considerable skill, and it is not available in any sticks which centralise the head by means of a curve or bend in the lower shaft region.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a hockey stick comprising an elonqate handle region merging at its lower end with an elongate shaft region which merges at its lower end with a head region wherein the shaft region and/or the head region incorporate an extended playing section disposed such that, in open stick use, when the outer edge of the head region and/or the extended playing section in the region of the merger thereof is in contact with the ground, and the axis of the extended playing section is generally parallel to the ground, the free end of the handle region is spaced off the ground by at least 2cm.<br>
In one preferred embodiment/ this invention provides a hockey stick comprising a handle region merging at its lower end with a shaft region which merges at its lowpr end with a head region, wherein the shaft region and/or the head region incorporate an extended playing section which extends at a forwardly inclined angle with respect to the axis of the handle region.<br>
By this arrangement, when the stick is located in an open stick playing fashion with the outer edge of the playing section extending along the ground, the handle extends at an upwardly inclined angle to the ground. In order to make effective use of the playing area, the stick<br><br>
4<br>
does not need to be held with Che playing section in contact with the ground along the whole of its outer edge; provided the highesc point of the outer edge is no more than half a ball height (that is typically 3.5cm) off the ground, the playing section may still provide an effective playing area along its entire length.  This therefore further increases the angle of inclination of the handle to the ground.  This feature is extremely important as it means that the player can place the playing section on the ground or in close proximity thereto without needing to place the handle close to the ground.  Thus he does not have to reach so far to get the playing section in contact with the ball when on the ground, or sufficiently near, which means that he can reach this position quicker.  Also the fact that the knuckles are further away from the ground means they are less likely to be damaged during play. In turn this keeps the head further from the ground improving safety in many ways.  Once the stick is disposed with the playing section in contact with the ground or with the outer edge no more than half  a ball height off the ground, this gives an extended playing surface along which the ball  can be accelerated or decelerated in use as required to perform a particular manoeuvre.  This elongated acceleration/deceleration region is extremely useful in creating substantial power and/or lift, for example in passing, or drag flicking or other manoeuvres.<br>
The longitudinal axis of the playing section is preferably  offset  rearwardly  with  respect  to  the<br><br>
s<br>
longitudinal axis of the handle region; alternatively there may be no offset and the playing section may comprise a cranked extension of the shaft region. , The term "offset rearwardly" is used to mean that the longitudinal axis of the playing section is disposed rearwardly of the longitudinal axis of the handle region at their merger, and that the longitudinal axes may or may not be parallel.<br>
The stick may include one or more forward or rearward curves intermediate the playing section and the lower end of said handle region. In one preferred arrangement, the stick includes an upper, rearward curve and a lower compensating forward curve disposed above said playing section. In certain arrangements it may be beneficial to include a further forward curve above said rearward curve.<br>
Likewise, the stick may advantageously include one or more forward or rearward curves in the merger region of the lower end of said shaft region and the head region.<br>
Preferably the playing section extends at an angle of between 5Â° and 20Â° with respect to the longitudinal axis of the handle region, and more preferably between 7Â° and 12Â°. It will be appreciated that an increased angle of inclination between the playing section and the longitudinal axis of the handle region increases the effective height of the handle region off the ground when the playing section extends horizontally in the open stick position.<br>
The preferred angle of inclination for any particular stick may depend partly on the length of the playing section.  In general the shorter the playing section, the<br><br>
6<br>
greater the angle may be. However it is also true that the greater the playing section the greater the potential power and deception derived. Hence it is clear that in designing the sticks of this invention a balance must be achieved between ease of action and power/deception. Where the length is less than 10cm the derived benefits of the playing section are not evident; a clear advantage at a comfortable angle is achieved with a length of at least 12. 5cm and preferably at least 15cm, and a very good balance of effects is obtained at 20-rm.<br>
The angle of inclination could be enhanced without modifying the length of the playing section by increasing the rearward deviation (as herebelow defined) of the shaft just prior to the playing section or offsetting the head forwardly of its natural position where the crown  (as herebelow defined) lies just forward of the axis of the handle.  Both of these .produce a greater aperture beneath the stick through which the ball can pass in a reverse stick block and both have the potential to lead to an unbalanced and ungainly dribbling action.  The rearward deviation is preferably at least 0.5cm and more preferably at least l cm. However it should be noted that increasing the rearward deviation does not necessarily lead to an unbalanced dribbling action.  Where the deviation is small, the weight provided  rearwardly  of  the  axis  of  the  handle counterbalances the weight provided forwardly by the toe (as herebelow defined) of the stick/ and where the sizes of these two elements are chosen carefully the balance can be<br><br>
7<br>
substantially improved and resultantly so can the dribbling action.<br>
In earlier modified hockey sticks, there has been an attempt to centralise the crown of the stick beneath the axis of the handle to improve the dribbling action and although this feature is desirable in this invention it produces a detrimental reduction in the angle of the handle. Hence a balance must also be drawn when designing sticks of this invention between the ease of the primary ball propelling action and the balance of the dribbling action, and the ability to produce a reverse stick block action. Although a centralised head with a long parallel or forwardly inclined playing section is beneficial in some respects, a stick with a head in its more traditional position with the crown some 2cm to 4cm forward of the axis of the handle, with a forwardly inclined playing section may be more beneficial.   The detrimental effect upon the dribbling action of a substantially forwardly disposed head may be enough to outweigh the benefit provided of enhanced length of playing section and improved angle of inclination. Thus, particularly preferred sticks have playing sections of around 20cms length, inclined either parallel to the axis of the handle or at any angle above this, with good results being produced at around 5 to 12 degrees and possibly at greater angles up to 25 degrees.<br>
Due to the counterbalancing effects of the rearward deviation which can be provided in this invention there is a clear opportunity.to provide a balanced yet enlarged toe<br><br>
8<br>
area and the toe height, that is the distance measured from the ground to the tip of the toe when the stick is placed on the ground with the handle region vertical, is preferably between 7cm and 10.2Scm.<br>
In all the various embodiments defined above, the extended playing region is preferably generally straight. In some sticks however, the extended playing region may be gently curved to provide a generally convex outer edge.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described above,, it extends to any 'inventive combination of the features set out above or in the following description.<br>

In   the   informal   drawings   accompanying   this<br>
Specification various dimensions are given; these are illustrative only and are not intended to restrict the invention. Furthermore/ the sticks as illustrated have been designed to comply with current understanding of the guideline of the Federation Internationale de Hockey Rules<br><br>
11<br>
Board, but the invention is not . limited to sticks in compliance with these guidelines.<br>
Referring to the Figures, many parts are the same or similar and so are given the same reference numerals. The stick of Figures la and 1b will be described in detail and then the variations of the remaining sticks will be described.<br>
The hockey sticks illustrated comprise a handle 10, a shaft 12, and extended playing section 14 (also referred to as a power 2one) , a head IS and a toe 13. The region 20 of the head 16 which contacts the ground when the stick is held with the handle 10 vertical is called the crown. in Figure 1, the playing section 14 is offset rearwardly such that the rearward deviation 13 of the outer edge from the line of the shaft is 2cm,' the maximum allowed under current practice. This deviation is referred to herein as "the rearward deviation". Likewise the width of the playing section 14 is the currently allowed maximum of 5cm. The toe 18 is of average height, 7cm.<br>
Three ground lines are marked in Figures 1 to 15, namely a reverse stick ground line 22 which is the ground line when the stick is placed-in the reverse block position; a playing section ground line 24 which is the ground line when the stick is in the open stick position with the playing section flat or as nearly as possible to the ground (the lower playing position); and a raised section ground line 26, which is the ground line when the stick is pivoted about the head away from the playing section ground line 24<br><br>
12<br>
until the highest part of the playing section is spaced by-half the height of a ball 28 off the ground (the raised playing position). This is generally the furthest that the stick can be raised whilst still providing the full length of the playing section 14.<br>
In use, when the stick is played open stick with the head on the ground, the extended playing section 14 provides an elongated playing section or power zone along which a ball may be accelerated or decelerated in either direction between the head end and the shaft end of the playing section. The full elongate extent of this section is available as soon as the stick is placed m the raised playing position although many players may prefer to drop the stick to the lower playing position in which, in Figure 1 at least, the outer edge of the stick is laid flat along the ground. In Figure 1, when the stick is in the lower playing position, the handle is upwardly inclined at about 7Â°. This means that the players hands are well clear of the ground when the stick is in this position.<br>
In Figures 2a and 2b, the arrangement of the handle and shaft is generally similar to Figure l, but the toe height is. much less.<br>
In Figures 3a and 3b the playing section is generally similar although there is a slight forward curve at the lower end of the shaft before the playing section begins. The toe height is intermediate that of Figures 1 and 2 and the head is less tightly curved.<br>
Referring to Figures 4a and 4b, here the toe height is<br><br>
13<br>
increased to provide a hooked head.<br>
Referring to Figures 5a and 5b, in this arrangement the head is generally V-shaped.<br>
Referring to Figures 6a and 6b, in this arrangement the head is provided with a recessed portion for encircling a hockey ball and providing a catching, cradling, or cupping effect similar to that described in my earlier International Patent Application No. PCT/GB97/01212.<br>
In Figures 7a and 7b, there is shown an arrangement in which the axial length of the extended playing section is shorter than that of Figure 1, and the angle of inclination of the elongate axis of the playing section relative to that of the handle is increased to about 11Â°. The toe height and tightness of the curve of the head is similar to that of Figure 1.<br>
The stick of Figures 8a and 8b is similar to that of Figures 7 except that the length of the playing section is shorter still with a commensurate increase in the angle of inclination of the handle.<br>
Figures 9a and 9b show a stick similar to that of Figures 4a and 4b although the angle of inclination of the playing section is increased with the result that the crown is positioned well forward of the longitudinal axis of the handle.<br>
Figures 10a and lob show a stick similar to that of Figure 1 except that the extended playing section is gently curved to provide a rolling curve.<br>
Figures lla and l1b show an arrangement in which there<br><br>
14<br>
is no offset between the longitudinal axis of the handle and the longitudinal axis of the playing section. Thus the stick is similar to that of Figure 1 except without the rearward offset, making the crown substantially forwardiy offset.<br>
Figures 12a and 12b show an arrangement similar to Figure 1 with an offset between the axis of the playing section and the handle but in which these axis are parallel. Figures 13a and 13b show an arrangement similar to Figure I at the lower end of the stick buc with a serpentine curved region extending forwardly before extending rearwardly as previously.<br>
Figures 14a and 14b show an arrangement in which the shaft incorporates a rearwardly projecting serpentine curve before merging with the playing section.<br>
Figures 15a and 15b show an arrangement in which the shaft incorporates a forward curve followed by a rearward curve before merging with the playing section 14.<br>
Figure IS shows an arrangement in which the .lower end of the playing section 14 terminates with a rearward curve which blends into an enlarged playing head 16 of the type described in my Published PCT Application No. PCT/GB97/01212.<br>
The embodiments of Figures 1 to 12 and 14 to 16 each comprise an arrangement in which the longitudinal axis of the playing section 14 is offset: rearwardly to that of the remainder of the handle 10 and the shaft 12.<br>
As will be clear from the above embodiments, various<br><br>
15<br>
modifications to the stick may be incorporated without departing from the invention.<br>
The sticks as described above provide a number of benefits:-<br>
1.	Improved dribbling action - produced through the<br>
provision of a rearward curve in the shaft which centralises<br>
the head beneath the shaft, and provides weight to the rear<br>
of the shaft counterbalancing the forward extending toe<br>
region,<br>
2.	Improved reverse  stick skills  -  through  the<br>
availability to provide an enlarged toe which is not too<br>
cumbersome in the dribbling action because it is balanced by<br>
the enlarged power zone.  Thus the stick can hit, push,<br>
flick and control che ball better on the reverse side.<br>
3.	Improved and safer open stick ball collection -<br>
the elongate playing section can be used at greater reach<br>
and from a more comfortable and upright position to collect<br>
the ball on the ground with the shaft more or less laid<br>
along the ground. This same strong barrier can be provided<br>
in the process of a tackle and may provide greater power,<br>
strength, mobility and safety than the traditional sticks.<br>
This facility has much to offer goalkeepers who often have<br>
to play the ball whilst outstretched on the ground and<br>
wearing large protective gloves which commonly force the<br>
right hand and the stick some crucial three or more inches<br>
off the ground.  Hence the described sticks can be used to<br>
counter this problem.<br>
4.	Improved power and deception when pushing the ball<br><br>
16<br>
in a more manoeuvrable, upright and safer position; or the ability to push the ball with the stick held almost flat to the ground, where the ball starts contact some fifteen centimetres up the stick from the crown and is slung down the shaft, has been possible with straight traditional sticks, but only for the most courageous and skilled players. The existing sticks place the head close to the ground and put considerable strain on the back whilst often scraping the knuckles on the floor drawing blood. The sticks described above allow this action to be performed with the knuckles some one to two feet off the ground, making it safer, easier, more comfortable and mobile to perform.<br>
5.	. Improved drag flicking - this art.is commonly used<br>
at penalty corners and involves the ball being driven down<br>
the stick from the crown whilst the stick is near to flat on<br>
the ground and then flung back down Che shaft which is<br>
inclined slightly backwards as Che player lurches forward<br>
and upwards to propel the ball into the air at pace.  By<br>
allowing the player to lay the shaft flat along the ground<br>
with the knuckles a foot or so off the ground the action is<br>
made considerably more comfortable,  safe and easier to<br>
perform.<br>
6.	Guiding  collection  for  ball  catching    in<br>
configurations of this stick where a substantial gape is<br>
provided between the 1 imbs of the head and hence bal 1<br>
catching of one type or other is available, the power zone<br>
provides a guide down which the ball can be driven to ease<br><br>
17 and guide collection of the ball into the gape.<br><br>

IMPROVED HOCKEY STICK<br>
This invention relates to an improved hockey stick and, in particular but not exclusively, to hockey sticks intended for outfield players.<br>
A traditional form of hockey stick is made up of four portions, namely a handle, a shaft, a head and a toe. The handle typically extends for the upper three fifths or sc of the stick. The shaft typically occupies the majority of the remaining lower two fifths of the stick and merges at its lower end with the head. The head typically occupies only a small proportion of the vertical dimension at the base of the sticks but the bulk of the horizontal dimension. The head terminates in a generally upwardly directed toe portion.<br>
The allowable playing surface or "face" of the stick is the front, predominantly flat area of the stick which is presented forwardly with the toe provided on the right haÂ£
In this Specification,  various terms are used describe  the  shape  and geometry  of  a  hockey slick References to vertical, brisontal, rearward, forward etc<br>
refer to the stick when viewed in the orientation of figure<br>
i       <br>
1 of the accompanying drawings, that is on the back of the<br>
stick, with the axes of the handle and shaft generally<br><br>
vertical, with the toe pointing away from the player (ie. forwardly) . Thus a forward curve or inclination is an anticlockwise angular displacement when the stick is viewed in<br><br>
2<br>
the orientation of Figure 1.<br>
Playing on the open stick means playing the stick forehand in the usual attitude with the toe of the stick pointing away from the player, and the bulk of the stick on the player's right hand side; playing on the reverse stick means playing the stick backhand with the stick flipped through 1800 about the axis of the handle, so that the toe is nearest the ground and the bulk of the stick lies on the player's left hand side. At present all sticks are right-handed but the invention extends to left-handed versions (i.e. substantially mirror images of left-handed sticks) and the terminology herein is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
A reverse stick block is when the stick is held on the reverse stick side with the free end of the toe'in contact with the ground, and the shaft extending generally parallel to the ground.<br>
As a professional coach, I have analysed the features<br>
of existing sticks and also, the dynamics of the strategy of<br>
the game itself.  I have found chat a player's skill and<br>
ball control can be considerably improved if the hockey<br>
stick is re-designed to provide the unusual and innovative<br>
feature of an extended elongate playing area in the region<br>
of the head and/or shaft of the stick, which extended area<br>
allows a player to slide and propel the hockey ball to<br>
impart  substantial  acceleration  or  deceleration  and<br>
potential lift to the ball. . This feature, with suitable<br>
training, can help generate enhanced pace, accuracy and<br>
deception  in  passing  and  drag-flicking.    Something<br><br>
.3<br>
approaching this effect can be produced by expert players with certain traditional sticks, but only whilst placing the knuckles practically on the ground surface and only when exhibiting considerable skill, and it is not available in any sticks which centralise the head by means of a curve or bend in the lower shaft region.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a hockey stick comprising an elonqate handle region merging at its lower end with an elongate shaft region which merges at its lower end with a head region wherein the shaft region and/or the head region incorporate an extended playing section disposed such that, in open stick use, when the outer edge of the head region and/or the extended playing section in the region of the merger thereof is in contact with the ground, and the axis of the extended playing section is generally parallel to the ground, the free end of the handle region is spaced off the ground by at least 2cm.<br>
In one preferred embodiment/ this invention provides a hockey stick comprising a handle region merging at its lower end with a shaft region which merges at its lowpr end with a head region, wherein the shaft region and/or the head region incorporate an extended playing section which extends at a forwardly inclined angle with respect to the axis of the handle region.<br>
By this arrangement, when the stick is located in an open stick playing fashion with the outer edge of the playing section extending along the ground, the handle extends at an upwardly inclined angle to the ground. In order to make effective use of the playing area, the stick<br><br>
4<br>
does not need to be held with Che playing section in contact with the ground along the whole of its outer edge; provided the highesc point of the outer edge is no more than half a ball height (that is typically 3.5cm) off the ground, the playing section may still provide an effective playing area along its entire length.  This therefore further increases the angle of inclination of the handle to the ground.  This feature is extremely important as it means that the player can place the playing section on the ground or in close proximity thereto without needing to place the handle close to the ground.  Thus he does not have to reach so far to get the playing section in contact with the ball when on the ground, or sufficiently near, which means that he can reach this position quicker.  Also the fact that the knuckles are further away from the ground means they are less likely to be damaged during play. In turn this keeps the head further from the ground improving safety in many ways.  Once the stick is disposed with the playing section in contact with the ground or with the outer edge no more than half  a ball height off the ground, this gives an extended playing surface along which the ball  can be accelerated or decelerated in use as required to perform a particular manoeuvre.  This elongated acceleration/deceleration region is extremely useful in creating substantial power and/or lift, for example in passing, or drag flicking or other manoeuvres.<br>
The longitudinal axis of the playing section is preferably  offset  rearwardly  with  respect  to  the<br><br>
s<br>
longitudinal axis of the handle region; alternatively there may be no offset and the playing section may comprise a cranked extension of the shaft region. , The term "offset rearwardly" is used to mean that the longitudinal axis of the playing section is disposed rearwardly of the longitudinal axis of the handle region at their merger, and that the longitudinal axes may or may not be parallel.<br>
The stick may include one or more forward or rearward curves intermediate the playing section and the lower end of said handle region. In one preferred arrangement, the stick includes an upper, rearward curve and a lower compensating forward curve disposed above said playing section. In certain arrangements it may be beneficial to include a further forward curve above said rearward curve.<br>
Likewise, the stick may advantageously include one or more forward or rearward curves in the merger region of the lower end of said shaft region and the head region.<br>
Preferably the playing section extends at an angle of between 5Â° and 20Â° with respect to the longitudinal axis of the handle region, and more preferably between 7Â° and 12Â°. It will be appreciated that an increased angle of inclination between the playing section and the longitudinal axis of the handle region increases the effective height of the handle region off the ground when the playing section extends horizontally in the open stick position.<br>
The preferred angle of inclination for any particular stick may depend partly on the length of the playing section.  In general the shorter the playing section, the<br><br>
6<br>
greater the angle may be. However it is also true that the greater the playing section the greater the potential power and deception derived. Hence it is clear that in designing the sticks of this invention a balance must be achieved between ease of action and power/deception. Where the length is less than 10cm the derived benefits of the playing section are not evident; a clear advantage at a comfortable angle is achieved with a length of at least 12. 5cm and preferably at least 15cm, and a very good balance of effects is obtained at 20-rm.<br>
The angle of inclination could be enhanced without modifying the length of the playing section by increasing the rearward deviation (as herebelow defined) of the shaft just prior to the playing section or offsetting the head forwardly of its natural position where the crown  (as herebelow defined) lies just forward of the axis of the handle.  Both of these .produce a greater aperture beneath the stick through which the ball can pass in a reverse stick block and both have the potential to lead to an unbalanced and ungainly dribbling action.  The rearward deviation is preferably at least 0.5cm and more preferably at least l cm. However it should be noted that increasing the rearward deviation does not necessarily lead to an unbalanced dribbling action.  Where the deviation is small, the weight provided  rearwardly  of  the  axis  of  the  handle counterbalances the weight provided forwardly by the toe (as herebelow defined) of the stick/ and where the sizes of these two elements are chosen carefully the balance can be<br><br>
7<br>
substantially improved and resultantly so can the dribbling action.<br>
In earlier modified hockey sticks, there has been an attempt to centralise the crown of the stick beneath the axis of the handle to improve the dribbling action and although this feature is desirable in this invention it produces a detrimental reduction in the angle of the handle. Hence a balance must also be drawn when designing sticks of this invention between the ease of the primary ball propelling action and the balance of the dribbling action, and the ability to produce a reverse stick block action. Although a centralised head with a long parallel or forwardly inclined playing section is beneficial in some respects, a stick with a head in its more traditional position with the crown some 2cm to 4cm forward of the axis of the handle, with a forwardly inclined playing section may be more beneficial.   The detrimental effect upon the dribbling action of a substantially forwardly disposed head may be enough to outweigh the benefit provided of enhanced length of playing section and improved angle of inclination. Thus, particularly preferred sticks have playing sections of around 20cms length, inclined either parallel to the axis of the handle or at any angle above this, with good results being produced at around 5 to 12 degrees and possibly at greater angles up to 25 degrees.<br>
Due to the counterbalancing effects of the rearward deviation which can be provided in this invention there is a clear opportunity.to provide a balanced yet enlarged toe<br><br>
8<br>
area and the toe height, that is the distance measured from the ground to the tip of the toe when the stick is placed on the ground with the handle region vertical, is preferably between 7cm and 10.2Scm.<br>
In all the various embodiments defined above, the extended playing region is preferably generally straight. In some sticks however, the extended playing region may be gently curved to provide a generally convex outer edge.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described above,, it extends to any 'inventive combination of the features set out above or in the following description.<br>

In   the   informal   drawings   accompanying   this<br>
Specification various dimensions are given; these are illustrative only and are not intended to restrict the invention. Furthermore/ the sticks as illustrated have been designed to comply with current understanding of the guideline of the Federation Internationale de Hockey Rules<br><br>
11<br>
Board, but the invention is not . limited to sticks in compliance with these guidelines.<br>
Referring to the Figures, many parts are the same or similar and so are given the same reference numerals. The stick of Figures la and 1b will be described in detail and then the variations of the remaining sticks will be described.<br>
The hockey sticks illustrated comprise a handle 10, a shaft 12, and extended playing section 14 (also referred to as a power 2one) , a head IS and a toe 13. The region 20 of the head 16 which contacts the ground when the stick is held with the handle 10 vertical is called the crown. in Figure 1, the playing section 14 is offset rearwardly such that the rearward deviation 13 of the outer edge from the line of the shaft is 2cm,' the maximum allowed under current practice. This deviation is referred to herein as "the rearward deviation". Likewise the width of the playing section 14 is the currently allowed maximum of 5cm. The toe 18 is of average height, 7cm.<br>
Three ground lines are marked in Figures 1 to 15, namely a reverse stick ground line 22 which is the ground line when the stick is placed-in the reverse block position; a playing section ground line 24 which is the ground line when the stick is in the open stick position with the playing section flat or as nearly as possible to the ground (the lower playing position); and a raised section ground line 26, which is the ground line when the stick is pivoted about the head away from the playing section ground line 24<br><br>
12<br>
until the highest part of the playing section is spaced by-half the height of a ball 28 off the ground (the raised playing position). This is generally the furthest that the stick can be raised whilst still providing the full length of the playing section 14.<br>
In use, when the stick is played open stick with the head on the ground, the extended playing section 14 provides an elongated playing section or power zone along which a ball may be accelerated or decelerated in either direction between the head end and the shaft end of the playing section. The full elongate extent of this section is available as soon as the stick is placed m the raised playing position although many players may prefer to drop the stick to the lower playing position in which, in Figure 1 at least, the outer edge of the stick is laid flat along the ground. In Figure 1, when the stick is in the lower playing position, the handle is upwardly inclined at about 7Â°. This means that the players hands are well clear of the ground when the stick is in this position.<br>
In Figures 2a and 2b, the arrangement of the handle and shaft is generally similar to Figure l, but the toe height is. much less.<br>
In Figures 3a and 3b the playing section is generally similar although there is a slight forward curve at the lower end of the shaft before the playing section begins. The toe height is intermediate that of Figures 1 and 2 and the head is less tightly curved.<br>
Referring to Figures 4a and 4b, here the toe height is<br><br>
13<br>
increased to provide a hooked head.<br>
Referring to Figures 5a and 5b, in this arrangement the head is generally V-shaped.<br>
Referring to Figures 6a and 6b, in this arrangement the head is provided with a recessed portion for encircling a hockey ball and providing a catching, cradling, or cupping effect similar to that described in my earlier International Patent Application No. PCT/GB97/01212.<br>
In Figures 7a and 7b, there is shown an arrangement in which the axial length of the extended playing section is shorter than that of Figure 1, and the angle of inclination of the elongate axis of the playing section relative to that of the handle is increased to about 11Â°. The toe height and tightness of the curve of the head is similar to that of Figure 1.<br>
The stick of Figures 8a and 8b is similar to that of Figures 7 except that the length of the playing section is shorter still with a commensurate increase in the angle of inclination of the handle.<br>
Figures 9a and 9b show a stick similar to that of Figures 4a and 4b although the angle of inclination of the playing section is increased with the result that the crown is positioned well forward of the longitudinal axis of the handle.<br>
Figures 10a and lob show a stick similar to that of Figure 1 except that the extended playing section is gently curved to provide a rolling curve.<br>
Figures lla and l1b show an arrangement in which there<br><br>
14<br>
is no offset between the longitudinal axis of the handle and the longitudinal axis of the playing section. Thus the stick is similar to that of Figure 1 except without the rearward offset, making the crown substantially forwardiy offset.<br>
Figures 12a and 12b show an arrangement similar to Figure 1 with an offset between the axis of the playing section and the handle but in which these axis are parallel. Figures 13a and 13b show an arrangement similar to Figure I at the lower end of the stick buc with a serpentine curved region extending forwardly before extending rearwardly as previously.<br>
Figures 14a and 14b show an arrangement in which the shaft incorporates a rearwardly projecting serpentine curve before merging with the playing section.<br>
Figures 15a and 15b show an arrangement in which the shaft incorporates a forward curve followed by a rearward curve before merging with the playing section 14.<br>
Figure IS shows an arrangement in which the .lower end of the playing section 14 terminates with a rearward curve which blends into an enlarged playing head 16 of the type described in my Published PCT Application No. PCT/GB97/01212.<br>
The embodiments of Figures 1 to 12 and 14 to 16 each comprise an arrangement in which the longitudinal axis of the playing section 14 is offset: rearwardly to that of the remainder of the handle 10 and the shaft 12.<br>
As will be clear from the above embodiments, various<br><br>
15<br>
modifications to the stick may be incorporated without departing from the invention.<br>
The sticks as described above provide a number of benefits:-<br>
1.	Improved dribbling action - produced through the<br>
provision of a rearward curve in the shaft which centralises<br>
the head beneath the shaft, and provides weight to the rear<br>
of the shaft counterbalancing the forward extending toe<br>
region,<br>
2.	Improved reverse  stick skills  -  through  the<br>
availability to provide an enlarged toe which is not too<br>
cumbersome in the dribbling action because it is balanced by<br>
the enlarged power zone.  Thus the stick can hit, push,<br>
flick and control che ball better on the reverse side.<br>
3.	Improved and safer open stick ball collection -<br>
the elongate playing section can be used at greater reach<br>
and from a more comfortable and upright position to collect<br>
the ball on the ground with the shaft more or less laid<br>
along the ground. This same strong barrier can be provided<br>
in the process of a tackle and may provide greater power,<br>
strength, mobility and safety than the traditional sticks.<br>
This facility has much to offer goalkeepers who often have<br>
to play the ball whilst outstretched on the ground and<br>
wearing large protective gloves which commonly force the<br>
right hand and the stick some crucial three or more inches<br>
off the ground.  Hence the described sticks can be used to<br>
counter this problem.<br>
4.	Improved power and deception when pushing the ball<br><br>
16<br>
in a more manoeuvrable, upright and safer position; or the ability to push the ball with the stick held almost flat to the ground, where the ball starts contact some fifteen centimetres up the stick from the crown and is slung down the shaft, has been possible with straight traditional sticks, but only for the most courageous and skilled players. The existing sticks place the head close to the ground and put considerable strain on the back whilst often scraping the knuckles on the floor drawing blood. The sticks described above allow this action to be performed with the knuckles some one to two feet off the ground, making it safer, easier, more comfortable and mobile to perform.<br>
5.	. Improved drag flicking - this art.is commonly used<br>
at penalty corners and involves the ball being driven down<br>
the stick from the crown whilst the stick is near to flat on<br>
the ground and then flung back down Che shaft which is<br>
inclined slightly backwards as Che player lurches forward<br>
and upwards to propel the ball into the air at pace.  By<br>
allowing the player to lay the shaft flat along the ground<br>
with the knuckles a foot or so off the ground the action is<br>
made considerably more comfortable,  safe and easier to<br>
perform.<br>
6.	Guiding  collection  for  ball  catching    in<br>
configurations of this stick where a substantial gape is<br>
provided between the 1 imbs of the head and hence bal 1<br>
catching of one type or other is available, the power zone<br>
provides a guide down which the ball can be driven to ease<br><br>
17 and guide collection of the ball into the gape.<br><br>
