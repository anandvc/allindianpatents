CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/957,765 filed on August 24, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices, and more particularly to a transmission having nine or ten speeds, four<br>
planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches or brakes, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0032] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0033] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the automatic transmission of the present invention has an<br>
arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the<br>
four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a first planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a second planetary<br>
gear set. A second component or element of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of the second planetary<br>
gear set. A first component or element of a third planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a first component or element of a fourth planetary gear<br>
set. Finally, a second component or element of the third planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a ten speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br><br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0035] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0036] The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to the second node<br>
14B of the first planetary gear set 14. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled<br>
to the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node 14A of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the second node 16B of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16. The third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
coupled to the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16. The second<br>
node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the first node 20A of the<br><br>
fourth planetary gear set 20. The third node 18C of the third planetary gear set<br>
18 is coupled to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0037] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the input shaft or member<br>
12 and the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 with the second<br>
node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A second clutch 28 selectively<br>
connects the first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 and the second<br>
node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 with the first node 18A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the first node 16A of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 with the third node 20C of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the second node 16B of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 with the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 20. A first brake 34 selectively connects the first node 18A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18 with ground, stationary member, or transmission housing<br>
40. A second brake 36 selectively connects the third node 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 with ground, stationary member, or transmission housing<br>
40.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the ten speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes, and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br><br>
[0039] For example, the planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear<br>
member 14C, a ring gear member 14A, and a planet gear carrier member 14B<br>
that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one of which is shown).<br>
The planet gears 14D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 14C and the ring gear member 14A. The sun gear member 14C is<br>
connected for common rotation with a first shaft or interconnecting member 42.<br>
The ring gear member 14A is connected for common rotation with a second shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 44 and with the fourth clutch 32. The planet carrier<br>
member 14B is connected for common rotation with the input shaft or member<br>
12.<br>
[0040] The planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16C, a<br>
ring gear member 16A, and a planet gear carrier member 16B that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 16D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 16D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 16C<br>
and the ring gear member 16A. The sun gear member 16C is connected for<br>
common rotation with the first interconnecting member 42 and with a third shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 46. The ring gear member 16A is connected for<br>
common rotation with the third clutch 30. The planet carrier member 16B is<br>
connected for common rotation with the second interconnecting member 44 and<br>
with a fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48.<br>
[0041] The planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18C, a<br>
ring gear member 18A, and a planet gear carrier member 18B that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 18D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br><br>
gears 18D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 18C<br>
and the ring gear member 18A. The sun gear member 18C is connected for<br>
common rotation with a fifth shaft or interconnecting member 50 and with a sixth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 52. The ring gear member 18A is connected for<br>
common rotation with a seventh shaft or interconnecting member 54. The planet<br>
carrier member 18B is connected for common rotation with an eighth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 56.<br>
[0042] The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20C, a<br>
ring gear member 20A, and a planet gear carrier member 20B that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 20D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 20D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 20C<br>
and the ring gear member 20A. The sun gear member 20C is connected for<br>
common rotation with the sixth interconnecting member 52. The ring gear<br>
member 20A is connected for common rotation with the eighth interconnecting<br>
member 56 and with the output shaft or member 22. The planet carrier member<br>
20B is connected for common rotation with a ninth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 58.<br>
[0043] The input shaft or member 12 is preferably continuously<br>
connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not<br>
shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected<br>
with the final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0044] The torque transmitting devices or the clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and the brakes 34, 36 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br><br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing.<br>
For example, the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the input<br>
shaft or member 12 with the ninth shaft or interconnecting member 58. The<br>
second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the fourth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 48 with the seventh shaft or interconnecting member 54.<br>
The third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect the ring gear member<br>
16A with the fifth shaft or interconnecting member 50. The fourth clutch 32 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the ring gear member 14A with the fifth shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 50. The first brake 34 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect the seventh shaft or interconnecting member 54 with a stationary<br>
member or the transmission housing 40 in order to prevent the seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54 and therefore the ring gear member 18A from<br>
rotating relative to the transmission housing 40. The second brake 36 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the third shaft or interconnecting member 46<br>
with a stationary member or the transmission housing 40 in order to prevent the<br>
third shaft or interconnecting member 46 and therefore the sun gear member<br>
16C from rotating relative to the transmission housing 40.<br>
[0045] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the ten speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that the transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least ten forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio with a triple<br>
overdrive. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by<br><br>
engagement of one or more of the torque transmitting devices (i.e. first clutch 26,<br>
second clutch 28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32, first brake 34, and second<br>
brake 36), as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the<br>
various combinations of torque transmitting devices that are activated or<br>
engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the<br>
various gear states are also presented although it should be appreciated that<br>
these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over<br>
significant ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria .<br>
of the transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using<br>
the embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course,<br>
other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth<br>
count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0046] To establish reverse gear, the second clutch 28, the third clutch<br>
30, and the first brake 34 are engaged or activated. The second clutch 28<br>
connects the fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48 with the seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54. The third clutch 30 connects the ring gear member<br>
16A with the fifth shaft or interconnecting member 50. The first brake 34<br>
connects the seventh shaft or interconnecting member 54 with a stationary<br>
member or the transmission housing 40 in order to prevent the seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54 and therefore the ring gear member 18A from<br>
rotating relative to the transmission housing 40. Likewise, the ten forward ratios<br>
are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake engagement, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3.<br><br>
[0047] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the ten speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all the<br>
clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive<br>
or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear<br>
state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0048] Referring now to FIG. 4, an embodiment of a nine speed<br>
transmission 100 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. The transmission 100<br>
includes an input shaft or member 112, a first planetary gear set 114 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 114A, a second node 114B and a third node 114C, a<br>

120B and a third node 120C and an output shaft or member 122.<br>
[0049] The input shaft or member 112 is coupled to the second node<br>
114B of the first planetary gear set 114. The output shaft or member 122 is<br>
coupled to the second node 120B of the fourth planetary gear set 120. The first<br>

112 and the second node 114B of the first planetary gear set 114 with the third<br>
node 120C of the fourth planetary gear set 120. A second clutch 128 selectively<br>

first node 118A of the third planetary gear set 118. A third clutch 130 selectively<br>
connects the second node 116B of the second planetary gear set 116 with the<br>
third node 118C of the third planetary gear set 118. A fourth clutch 132<br>
selectively connects the third node 116C of the second planetary gear set 116<br>
with the third node 118C of the third planetary gear set 118. A first brake 134<br>
selectively connects the first node 114A of the first planetary gear set 114 with a<br>
stationary member or a transmission housing 140. A second brake 136<br>
selectively connects the first node 120A of the fourth planetary gear set 120 with<br>
a stationary member or the transmission housing 140.<br>
[0051] Referring now to FIG. 5, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the nine speed transmission 100 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 5, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 4 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes, and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br><br>
[0052] For example, the planetary gear set 114 includes a sun gear<br>
member 114A, a ring gear member 114C, and a planet gear carrier member<br>
114B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 114D (only one of which is<br>
shown). The planet gears 114D are each configured to intermesh with both the<br>
sun gear member 114A and the ring gear member 114C. The sun gear member<br>
114A is connected for common rotation with a first shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 142. The ring gear member 114C is connected for common rotation<br>
with a second shaft or interconnecting member 144 and with a third shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 146. The planet carrier member 114B is connected for<br>
common rotation with the input shaft or member 112.<br>
[0053] The planetary gear set 116 includes a sun gear member 116A,<br>
a ring gear member 116C, and a planet gear carrier member 116B that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 116D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 116D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member<br>
116A and the ring gear member 116C. The sun gear member 116A is connected<br>
for common rotation with the first shaft or interconnecting member 142 and with a<br>
fourth shaft or interconnecting member 148. The ring gear member 116C is<br>
connected for common rotation with a fifth shaft or interconnecting member 150.<br>
The planet carrier member 116B is connected for common rotation with the<br>
second shaft or interconnecting member 144 and with a sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 152.<br>
[0054] The planetary gear set 118 includes a sun gear member 118C,<br>
a ring gear member 118A, and a planet gear carrier member 118B that rotatably<br><br>
supports a set of planet gears 118D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 118D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member<br>
118C and the ring gear member 118A. The sun gear member 118C is<br>
connected for common rotation with a seventh shaft or interconnecting member<br>
154. The ring gear member 118A is connected for common rotation with an<br>
eighth shaft or interconnecting member 156. The planet carrier member 118B is<br>
connected for common rotation with a ninth shaft or interconnecting member 158.<br>
[0055] The planetary gear set 120 includes a sun gear member 120A,<br>
a ring gear member 120C, and a planet gear carrier member 120B that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 120D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 120D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member<br>
120A and the ring gear member 120C. The sun gear member 120A is connected<br>
for common rotation with the eighth shaft or interconnecting member 156. The<br>
ring gear member 120C is connected for common rotation with a tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 160. The planet carrier member 120B is connected for<br>
common rotation with the output shaft or member 122 and with the ninth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 158.<br>
[0056] The input shaft or member 112 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 122 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0057] The torque transmitting devices or the clutches 126, 128, 130,<br>
132 and the brakes 134, 136 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br><br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing.<br>
For example, the first clutch 126 is selectively engageable to connect the input<br>
shaft or member 112 with the tenth shaft or interconnecting member 160. The<br>
second clutch 128 is selectively engageable to connect the sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 152 with the eighth shaft or interconnecting member<br>

154. The first brake 134 is selectively engageable to connect the fourth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 148 with a stationary member or the transmission<br>
housing 140 in order to prevent the fourth shaft or interconnecting member 148<br>
and therefore the sun gear member 116A and the sun gear member 114A from<br>
rotating relative to the transmission housing 140. The second brake 136 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the eighth shaft or interconnecting member<br>
156 with a stationary member or the transmission housing 140 in order to prevent<br>
the eighth shaft or interconnecting member 156 and therefore the ring gear<br>
member 118A and the sun gear member 120A from rotating relative to the<br>
transmission housing 140.<br>
[0058] Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the nine speed transmission 100 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that the transmission 100 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft or member 112 to the output shaft or member 122 in at least nine<br><br>
forward speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the torque transmitting devices (i.e. first clutch 126, second<br>
clutch 128, third clutch 130, fourth clutch 132, first brake 134, and second brake<br>
136), as will be explained below. FIG. 6 is a truth table presenting the various<br>
combinations of torque transmitting devices that are activated or engaged to<br>
achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear<br>
states are also presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical<br>
values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges<br>
to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission<br>
100. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments<br>
of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 6. Of course, other gear ratios<br>
are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear<br>
configuration selected.<br>
[0059] To establish reverse gear, the second clutch 128, the fourth<br>
clutch 132, and the second brake 136 are engaged or activated. The second<br>
clutch 128 connects the sixth shaft or interconnecting member 152 with the<br>
eighth shaft or interconnecting member 156. The fourth clutch 132 connects the<br>
fifth shaft or interconnecting member 150 with the seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 154. The second brake 136 connects the eighth shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 156 with a stationary member or the transmission<br>
housing 140 in order to prevent the eighth shaft or interconnecting member 156<br>
and therefore the ring gear member 118A and the sun gear member 120A from<br><br>
rotating relative to the transmission housing 140. Likewise, the nine forward<br>
ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake<br>
engagement, as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
[0060] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the nine speed transmission 100 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0061] Turning now to FIG. 7, an embodiment of a transmission 200<br>
that combines the embodiments of the transmissions 10 and 100 is illustrated in<br>
a lever diagram format. The transmission 200 includes two levers including a<br>

represents a combination of the first node 114A of the first planetary gear set 114<br>
and the first node 116A of the second planetary gear set 116. The second node<br>
202B of the first lever 202 represents the second node 114B of the first planetary<br>
gear set 114. The third node 202C of the first lever 202 represents a<br><br>
combination of the third node 114C of the first planetary gear set 114 and the<br>
second node 116B of the second planetary gear set 116. The fourth node 202D<br>
of the first lever 202 represents the third node 116C of the second planetary gear<br>
set 116. The first node 204A of the second lever 204 represents a combination<br>
of the first node 118A of the third planetary gear set 118 and the first node 120A<br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 120. The second node 204B of the second lever<br>
204 represents a combination of the second node 118B of the third planetary<br>
gear set 118 and the second node 120B of the fourth planetary gear set 120.<br>
The third node 204C of the second lever 204 represents the third node 120C of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 120. The fourth node 204D of the first lever 204<br>
represents the third node 118C of the third planetary gear set 118.<br>
[0062] The second node 202B of the first lever 202 is coupled to an<br>
input shaft or member 212. The second node 204B of the second lever 204 is<br>
coupled to an output shaft or member 214. A first torque transmitting device 220<br>
is selectively engageable to connect the first node 202A of the first lever 202 with<br>
a stationary member or a transmission housing 216. A second torque<br>
transmitting device 222 is selectively engageable to connect the input shaft or<br>
member 212 with the third node 204C of the second lever 204. A third torque<br>

[0063] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
