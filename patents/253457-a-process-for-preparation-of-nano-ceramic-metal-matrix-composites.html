FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
"Melt-ceramic nano-composites made by in-situ pyrolysis of polymeric pre-cursors in the liquid melf, Ex. Magnesium composites dispersed with nano scale ceramic particles consisting of Magnesium, Silicon, Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
Metal matrix composites, or MMCs, most commonly consist of aluminum alloys which are reinforced with particles of a hard ceramic phase such as silicon carbide (SiC). These alloys have high elastic stiffness which is useful in applications such as brake-assemblies for automobiles. The MMCs are made by physically mixing particles of SiC into the molten metal. Several strategies for introducing the ceramic particles have been invented, but all of them use ceramic powders and the metal as the starting constituents for the fabrication of the MMCs.<br>
Survey of prior art in this area reveals that there exist process which cover only production of nano sized metal powder (Patent No. US20060167147A1) and mixing of nano powders of metal and ores in solid state condition. There is no prior literature / patent on the production / fabrication of nano ceramic-metal matrix composites involving solid-liquid or liquid-liquid interactions.<br>
The principal limitation of these methods is the difficulty of incorporating ceramic particles of nanoscale dimensions (typically less than one thousand nanometers) into the melt. This limitation arises from the tendency of the ceramic particles of this size to agglomerate in the powders (nanoscale particles in a powder attract and bond to one another due to van der Waal's force because this force increases highly nonlinearly with decreasing particle size). These agglomerates are difficult to break up into individual particles in the liquid metal. Without a uniform dispersion of the nanoscale particles the benefit of creep resistance and good yield strength at elevated temperatures cannot be achieved. Aluminum and magnesium-based MMCs with a uniform nanoscale dispersion of the ceramic phase would be an enabling technology for next generation automobile engines, jet engines, and other aerospace applications.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a process to over come the aforesaid limitations.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to introduce ceramic particles into the liquid metal from the polymeric route by in in-situ process.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide new process which eliminates the multiple steps involved in first fabricating the ceramic particles and then, in a separate step, incorporating them into the liquid melt.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to produce a nanoscale dispersion of the ceramic into the liquid melt.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is an apparatus to obtain Melt-ceramic nano-composites made by in-situ pyrolysis of polymeric pre-cursors in the liquid melt.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is the liquid metal environment for the pyrolysis of the polymer prevents the degradation of the organic and serves the same purpose as the inert environment used in the ex-situ process for making ceramics from the polymer.<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention the organic precursors used in said method is in liquid or a solid form.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention the organic precursor is cross-linked either directly by thermal process by adding catalyst, or by the sol-gel process into hard polymer or any other well known conventional processes.<br>

In still another embodiment of the instant invention the pyrolysis is carried out in controlled environments, usually an inert environment such as argon or nitrogen in order to preserve the desired chemical composition of an end product.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention hydrogen released during pyrolysis from the polymer is flushed by bubbling nitorogen or argon through the melt.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention melting point of metal is below the pyrolysis temperature and the pyrolysis process involves the removal of volatiles such as<br><br>
hydrogen, water vapor and in some instances alcohols and hydrocarbons in order to prevent fragmentation of the organic polymer.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention the organic-polymer is constituted from Si, O, C, and N, from a class known as polysilazanes and silsequioxanes.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention volume fraction of the cross-linked polymer powder added to the liquid meh ranges from 1 vol% to 70 vol%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention temperature of the melt mixture is raised to the pyrolysis temperature of the polymer preferably ranges from 800-1200°C, for a period of 1 h up to 8 h.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention the organic polymer/organic phase is added in the liquid form by injecting it directly into the liquid melt, where the external source of the organic liquid is held at ambient temperature.<br>
In still another embodiment of the instant invention the organic-polymer powder is added to facilitate mixing at a melt temperature of 660-800°C for Mg, where the melt is protected by argon gas purge.<br>
Another important embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus to introduce ceramic particles into the liquid metal from the polymeric pre-cursor route by in-situ process, said apparatus comprises; motor connecting to stirrer rod for rotating the stirrer; the stirrer rod having impeller at the bottom to force a fluid in a desired direction, crucible partially surrounding the impeller for melting and calcining materials at high temperatures.; and resistance heating furnace to maintain constant temperature during mixing.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention is the temperature for melting and calcining is ranging between 300° C to 1000" C.<br>
The innovation in this disclosure is to introduce ceramic particles into the liquid metal from the polymeric route by in in-situ process.<br>
In the last two decades ceramics, such as various oxides, carbides and nitrides, are being prepared from the chemical route. In these processes organic precursors are used to<br><br>
produce the ceramics directly by controlled pyrolysis of the organic. Examples of ceramics produced by this method include: various types of oxides by metalorganics, silicon carbides from carbosilanes, silicon oxycarbides from silsesquioxanes, and silicon nitride and silicon carbonitride from polysilazanes. The conversion of the organic into the ceramic occurs at temperatures ranging from 300°C to 1000°C. The pyrolysis must be carried out in controlled environments, usually an inert environment such as argon or nitrogen, in order to preserve the desired chemical composition of the end product. The pyrolysis process involves the removal of volatiles such as hydrogen, water vapor and in some instances alcohols and hydrocarbons; therefore, in order to prevent fragmentation of the organic polymer the heating rate of the temperature cycle used for pyrolysis must be controlled.<br>
The starting material, the organic, for the above process can be in the form of a liquid or a solid. If it is a solid it us usually dissolved into a solvent to create a liquid form. The organic is then cross linked either directly by a thermal process, by adding a catalyst, or by the well known sol-gel process into a hard polymer. It is this hard polymer which is then pyrolyzed into the high temperature ceramic material by the process outlined above.<br>
The basic premise of this invention is that the organic should be pvrolyzed within the hot liquid metal to create an in-situ dispersion of nanoscale ceramic particles. In-situ pyrolysis has the following unique features, which cannot be obtained in the current practice of mixing ceramic particles into liquid metals for the fabrication of MMCs. These unique features are:<br>
(A)	The new process eliminates the multiple steps involved in first fabricating the ceramic particles and then, in a separate step, incorporating them into the liquid melt. The complexities of handling ceramic powders, especially very fine powders, are completely eliminated.<br>
(B)	Fragmentation of the organic precursor during pvrolysis is an asset in the invented process since its aim is to produce a nanoscale dispersion of the ceramic into the liquid melt. The extent of fragmentation is controlled by changing the feed rate of<br><br>
the organic into the liquid melt, the temperature of the melt, and by injecting an inert carrier gas along with the organic in the injection process. (C)The liquid metal environment for the pyrolysis of the polymer prevents the degradation of the organic and serves the same purpose as the inert environment used in the ex-situ process for making ceramics from the polymer. Furthermore there can be beneficial reactions between the liquid metal and the organic precursors for producing hard phases of intermetallics which may further enhance the high temperature mechanical properties of the MMC.<br>
I'he in-situ dispersion of the ceramic can be achieved by following method. Firstly, the organic is first crosslinked into a hard polymer, this powder is crushed, and then added to the liquid melt for in-situ pyrolysis of the organic into the ceramic phase.<br>
Fig. 1 shows schematic set-up used for mixing ores linked powders of polysilazane precursor (Ceraset^'^) in liquid Magnesium metal and pyrolyzed in-situ.<br>
The process invention is particularly suitable for aluminum and magnesium alloys because of their relatively low melting points. For example the process above can only be used when the melting point is below the pyrolysis temperature; aluminum and magnesium alloys meet this requirement.<br>
In this instance the ceramic particles are expected to be constituted from silicon, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Some intermetallics may also have formed by reaction with the liquid melt. Fig. 2 shows SEM micrograph of 5% nano particle dispersed Magnesium Matrix Composite. Composites thus produced possess improved hardness and excellent creep properties compared to unreinforced Magnesium (Table 1).<br>
The examples which is explained in the present invention is not limiting to the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
