Thi s invention relates for agricultural thrashing and separating sub ass imblies and assemblies.<br>
The invention is a thrashing and separating assembly including a main rotating thrasher roller, assembly having a cylindrical, a helical thrasher separator assembly both of them mounted co-axially maintaining a constant clearance between the drum varies and the helical separator, determined by the optimum thrashing conditions.<br>
DISADVANTAGES OF SIMILAR MACHINES ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET.<br>
•	The crop cannot be fed directly when it is transported from the harvesting site to the machine in bundles; the bundle has to be opened up before feeding to the machine.<br>
•	During thrashing operations some percentage of the grain shell is damaged .These damaged grains cannot be used as seeds. It is also very difficult to filter the damaged grains.<br>
•	The thrashing operations in other machines ,does not guarantee<br>
100%thrashing .So some percentage of the grain escapes along with the hay ,which reduces the thrashing efficiency.<br>
•	Additional labour is required to separate the thrashed grains from the hay, which have escaped during ineffective thrashing operations.<br>
•	The present machine available in the market cuts the hay to smaller lengths, which is not convenient for transportation and storage. This results in wastage of the hay and results in inefficient handling<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE NEWLY INVENTED MACHINE:<br>
•	The crop which is transported site in bundles can be fed directly without unbundling.<br>
•	No damage is done on the grains during the thrashing process, so the thrashed out grains can be used as quality seeds.<br>
•	Because of 100% thrashing, there is no loss on the net yield.<br>
•	Additional labour is not required to separate the grains which escapes from the machines of the older versions which are already available in the market<br>
•	The hay is not to smaller lengths during the thrashing process and hence it is easy for transportation storage.<br><br>
Accordingly invention provides for a thrashing and separating machine comprising of a rotor receiving drive from a engine; a hopper for receiving hay upper cover cum guide unit adopted to thrash in conjunction with helical thrasher separator assembly: and a means for separation of paddy comprising of oscillator type filter assembly and blower assembly.<br>

Referring to the fig 2 there is shown the front, left end top perspective of the machine, with end covers of the thrashing chamber removed to give a glimpse of the thrashing camber which will be shown in more detail, subsequently.<br>
Referring to fig 3 gives the construct Ural details of the main thrasher roller assembly fig 3. It consists of the thrasher roller shaft-3.5 on which four shell support wheels-3.1 are mounted with suitable space. Five longitudinal members-3.4 are mounted equal spaced on the peripheral of the shell wheels-3.1 .the thrasher vanes-3.3 are welded on to the outer surface of the longitudinal members-3.4 at strategic locations. They are titled at certain angle. So as to create a partal vacuum inside the thrashing chamber. The direction of rotation of the thrasher roller fig 5 and the inclination of the thrasher vanes-3.3 are so arranged to suck air through the inlet chute and made to flow through the thrashing chamber and finally forced out by the rotation of the hey-thrower vanes3.2 via the outlet chute. The arrangement of thrasher vanes-3.3 on the consecutive longitudinal members is in a zigzag configuration, to make the thrashing more effective. The hay-thrower vanes-3.2 are not prescribed with any angles. So as to facilitate diverting the air flow from axial to radial direction.<br>
Referring to the fig 4 shows the constructions features of the thrasher cover cum guide unit-fig 4 it acts as the top enclosure for the thrashing chamber. The openings for crop inlet and hay outlet are provided in the thrasher cover cum guide unit fig 4 .The helical guides which are located at the "inside curved surface" of the cover cum guide unit fig 4.These guides decides the path of the crop during thrashing process without cutting the crop into smaller pieces, so that the hay coming out of the thrashing process is longer and more storage and transportations.<br>
Referring to the fig 5 the helical thrasher separator assembly-fig 5 is the reaction member against the force exerted by the thrasher roller assembly-fig 3 .The seeds separated from exerted by the thrasher roller assembly-fig 3 .The seeds separated from the crop are allowed to fall down through the gaps between the helically configured guide rods-5.1,these rods are supported by the side support members -5.2 intermediate stiffriers-5.4 and<br><br>
lorgitudinal tie rods-5.5 the top support members-5.3 acts as seating for the thrasher cum separator assembly fig S.the helically configured guide rods-5.1 facilitates both axial rotary movement of the crop, during thrashing process. The helical guides-4.1 in the top cover cum guiding unit -6^4 conform the foresaid movement of the crop flow coming out from the thrasher separator assembly-fig 5.<br>
The constructional features of the oscillating type filter assembly-fig 6 can be understood fi"om the transparent view shown in fig 6 of the oscillating mc vement of this filter is derived firom the drive. The seeds separated fi'om the crop during the thrashing process fall down through the gaps of the helically configured guide rods-5.1 falls on the first stage collector tray 6.6. Hence both the slope of the first stage collector tray-6.6 and the oscillatory movement, the seeds move and reach the grain separator cum hay filter -6.1 .the seeds will fall down through the holes of the grain separator -6.1 and falls down on the second stage collector tray-6.7 along with pieces of the hay dust, stones and sands etc.,T-7.3 is driven by the main drive shaft.<br>
The blower assembly blows the air over the variable grain filtering unit-6.2 and second stage collector tray-6.7 which takes away the dust and the hay pieces, through the filter rear cover. The variable gain filtering unit-6.3.the sand particles is allowed to fall down through the sand separating unit-6.3.the the seeds will moves over the sand separating unit 6.3 and falls down to the tubular grain collector unit-6.4 and comes out of the filter unit through the grain outlet-6.8.<br>
Referring to the fig 7 the power flow from the prime mover to various systems are shown. The diesel engine which is the prime mover -7.1 is the source of the power, which drives the main shaft-7.2 through a duplex v belt drive -7.4 the main shaft-7.2 drives the main thrasher roller assembly are built integral. The secondary drive-7.3 is driven by the main drive shaft-7.2 by a specially designed duplex v-belt drive-7.5 the special feature allows the power transmission between the mail drive shaft-7.2 and the secondary drive shall7.3 which arc mutually perpendicular to each other. Both these shafts are supported adequately by suitable bearings blocks. The secondary drive shaft7.3 provides driving power to the blower assembly and filter assembly through independent drive arrangements-7.6 and 7.7 respectively. It is also can be coupled P.T.O shaft with all types of tractors.<br>
The analysis of the gap between the main thrasher roller assembly-fig3, and the thrasher separator assembly-fig5,has been fixed so as to achieve<br><br>
optimum thrashing force, but not break the tip of the grains, the speed of thrasher roller assembly -fig3 which decide the reaction forces, is designed so that no damage is done on the outer shell of the separator grains. Any damage by excessive reaction forces due to unsafe rotational speed of the roller assembly-fig 3 will make the grain shells get damaged and they become unfit for using as seeds. In the same way if the reaction forces are less, then the thrashing may not be complete which allows some percentage of the grains to escape along with the hay.<br>
The shape and the strategic locations of the helical guides, built integral with the thrasher cover cum guide unit-fig 4 allows the thrashing process, hay comes out without being cut into small pieces. This facilitates easy handling and storage of the hay which is very much advantages from the local economical considerations.<br>
OPICRATION:<br>
This invention consists of inlet chute which is the way the crop is given to the machine and then it is passed to the rotor by which the constant clearance between them permits optimum thrashing force and allows the crop to move in the helical exacting optimum thrashing force. The speed of the main thrasher roller is determined based on the optimum thrashing force to be exerted between the helical thrasher separator assembly and the roller vanes according to the aforesaid thrashing process. There is no relative axial movement between the thrashing reaction members. The constant clearance and the optimum thrashing force is exerted partially by the thrashing vanes which are arranged in the angular orientations, located on the longitudinal members are arranged in such a way that they are not falling in same line of the thrasher varies mounted on the longitudinal members of the roller drum. The thrasher varies on the adjacent longitudinal members are arranged in such a way that they are not falling in the same line of the thrasher varies mounted on the longitudinal members explained in the previous sentence. This allows effective thrashing to take place through out the length of the thrashing vanes creates a partial vacuum inside the thrashing chamber. Hay through varies which are slightly longer than the thrashing vanes and are mounted on the other end of the roller drum. This help to direct the flow of the air, in a radial direction towards the outlet chute, the reaction member, which is helical thrasher assembly is used to exerts the main thrashing force<br><br>
during the thrashing process when the thrasher roller assembly rotates at certain speed. The angular orientation of the guide rods wit circular cross section, guides the crop in the helical path while exerting the necessary reacting force, the cover cum guide units which guides the crop in the upper half of the thrashing chamber in the continuation of the path explained in claim 5.they are arranged in such a manner so as to incur optimum force on the crop being thrashed, without cutting the hay into smaller lengths.<br>
SPECIAL FEATURES:<br>
