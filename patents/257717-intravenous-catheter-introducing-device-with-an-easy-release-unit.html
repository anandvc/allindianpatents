INTRAVENOUS CATHETER INTRODUCING DEVICE<br>
This invention relates to an intravenous catheter introducing device, more particularly to an intravenous catheter introducing device with a needle cannula which is retractable into a barrel for safe disposal.<br>
Conventional medical devices or syringes for medicine injection, drawing blood samples, etc., have to be disposed of safely after use to avoid accidental needle pricks or undesirable contamination. Although a tip protector is provided to be sleeved on the device after use to ensure that the needle is covered, the user is exposed to the risk of being pricked by the needle when sleeving the tip protector on the used device. Therefore, there are available medical devices or syringes with a retractable needle that is retractable into a barrel or a plunger after the injection operation is completed, such as those disclosed in Indian Patent Application Nos. 368/KOL/04, 395/KOL/04, 692/KOL/06 and 693/KOL/06 filed by the applicants. However, further improvements are desirable in order to ensure easy and safe retraction of the needle and to simplify the construction of medical devices or syringes.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an intravenous catheter introducing device which has a simplified construction and which can be operated easily and safely to retract a used needle cannula.<br>
According to this invention, the intravenous catheter introducing device includes a barrel having front and rear<br><br>
2<br>
open ends opposite to each other in a longitudinal direction, and a surrounding barrel wall which interconnects the front and rear open ends. The surrounding barrel wall includes a smaller-diameter wall portion and a larger-diameter wall portion. The surrounding barrel wall has an inner barrel wall surface to confine a passage, and an outer barrel wall surface having an access hole which is formed in the larger-diameter wall portion and which extends through the inner barrel wall surface. A needle cannula has a front segment terminating at a tip end, and a rear connecting end opposite to the front segment along the axis. A needle hub includes a front holding portion surrounded by the smaller-diameter wall portion, a rear shell portion slidable relative to the surrounding barrel wall along the axis between front and rear positions which are respectively proximate tothefrontopenendandtherearopenend, andan intermediate viewing-window portion disposed between the front holding portion and the rear shell portion. The front holding portion holds the rear connecting end of the needle cannula such that, when the rear shell portion is in the front position, the needle cannula is placed in a position of use, where the front segment extends forwardly of the front open end for ready use, and when the rear shell portion is in the rear position, the needle cannula is placed in a disposal position, where the front segment retreats into the passage. The rear shell portion extends to terminate at a retained end. The intermediate viewing-window portion defines a<br><br>
3<br>
blood-flow passage which is in fluid communication with the needle cannula. A biasing member is interposed between the rear shell portion and the inner barrel wall surface so as to bias the rear shell portion toward the rear position. The access hole is disposed in the vicinity of the retained end in the position of use such that, by accessing the retained end through the access hole, the retained end is enabled to be held against the biasing action of the biasing member. An easy release unit includes an engaging wall segment, left and right squeezed wall segments, and left and right latch members. The engaging wall segment is configured to attach to the outer barrel wall surface. The left and right squeezed wall segments extend from the engaging wall segment to be outboard to the outer barrel wall surface, and are opposite to each other in a first direction transverse to the longitudinal direction. The left and right squeezed wall segments extend in a second direction transverse to both the longitudinal direction and the first direction to terminate at left and right joint regions, respectively. The left and right squeezed wall segments are made of a flexible material such that upon being squeezed towards each other in the first transverse direction to thereby be placed in an actuated position, where the left and right joint regions are closer to each other, each of the left and right wall segments acquires a biasing force which biases the left and right wall segments towards a normal position, where the left and right joint regions are remote from each other.<br><br>
4<br>
The left and right latch members respectively have left proximate and distal segments opposite to each other, and right proximate and distal segments opposite to each other. The left and right proximate segments are disposed to couple respectively with the right and left joint regions, such that the left and right proximate segments are respectively moved with the right and left joint regions in the first direction. The left and right distal segments are configured such that, when the left and right proximate segments are respectively moved with the right and left joint regions to the actuated position, the left and right distal segments are moved away from each other in the first direction so as to steer clear of the retained end through the access hole, thereby permitting the biasing member to bias the rear shell portion towards the rear position.<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater detail, it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the first preferred embodiment of an intravenous catheter introducing device according to the present invention is shown to comprise a barrel 1, a needle cannula 41, a needle hub 2, a biasing member 5, a catheter connection assembly 4, a tip protector 10, and an easy release unit 3.<br>
The barrel 1 has front and rear open ends 122, 121 opposite to each other in a longitudinal direction, and a surrounding barrel wall 12 which interconnects the front and rear open ends 122,121. An end cap 18 is disposed to cover the rear open end 121. The surrounding barrel wall 12 includes a smaller-diameter wall portion 124 and a larger-diameter wall portion 123 which are opposite to each other in the longitudinal direction and which are proximate to the front and rear open ends 122,121, respectively, so as to define a shoulder portion 125 therebetween. The surrounding barrel wall 12 has an inner barrel wall surface which surrounds an axis in the longitudinal direction and which confines a passage 11 that is communicated with the front and rear open ends 122, 121, and an outer barrel wall surface opposite to the inner barrel wall surface in radial directions relative to the axis. The outer barrel wall surface has an access<br><br>
7<br>
hole which has left and right access hole portions 127 that are formed in the larger-diameter wall portion 123, that extend through the inner barrel wall surface, and that are diametrically opposite to each other in a first direction transverse to the longitudinal direction. The larger-diameter wall portion 123 has first and second ring portions 14,15 which extend radially and outwardly from the outer barrel wall surface, and which are spaced apart from each other in the longitudinal direction by a first annular groove 151. Two left and two right threshold barriers 141,153 extend respectively from the first and second ring portions 14,15 into the first annular groove 151, and cooperate with the outer barrel wall surface to define left and right retaining pits (151a). An engaging peg 13 is disposed on the outer barrel wall surface between the first and second ring portions 14,15. A third ring portion 16 extends radially and outwardly from the outer barrel wall surface, and is spaced apart from the second ring portion 15 in the longitudinal direction by a second annular groove 152. The left and right access hole portions 127 are disposed between the second and third ring portions 15, 16. Furthermore, the larger-diameter wall portion 123 has a guiding spacer 171 which extends from the outer barrel wall surface radially.<br>
The needle cannula 41 has a front segment terminating at a tip end 412, and a rear connecting end 411 opposite to the front segment along the axis.<br>
The needle hub 2 includes a front holding portion 21 and<br><br>
8<br>
a rear shell portion 22 disposed opposite to each other along the axis. The front holding portion 21 is surrounded by the smaller-diameter wall portion 124. The rear shell portion 22 is inserted into the passage 11 from the rear open end 121, and is disposed in and is slidable relative to the larger-diameter wall portion 12 3 along the axis between front and rear positions, which are respectively proximate to the front open end 122 and the rear open end 121. The front holding portion 21 holds the rear connecting end 411 of the needle cannula 41 such that, when the rear shell portion 22 is in the front position, the needle cannula 41 is placed in a position of use, where the front segment extends forwardly of the front open end 122 for ready use. When the rear shell portion 22 is in the rear position, the needle cannula 41 is placed in a disposal position, where the front segment retreats into the passage 11. The rear shell portion 22 surrounds the axis, and extends away from the front holding portion 21 to terminate at a retained end 221. The needle hub 2 further includes a transparent intermediate viewing-window portion 20 which is interposed between the front holding portion 21 and the rear shell portion 22 and which defines a blood-flow passage 201 that is in fluid communication with the needle cannula 41 for permitting viewing of blood flowing therein.<br>
The biasing member 5 is interposed between the rear shell portion 22 and the inner barrel wall surface, and has an abutting end 51 which abuts against ribs 126 formed on the<br><br>
9<br>
inner barrel wall surface of the larger-diameter wall portion 123 of the barrel 1 proximate to the shoulder 125, and an urging end 52 abutting against the retained end 221 of the rear shell portion 22 so as to bias the rear shell portion 22 toward the rear position. Hence, the biasing member 5 is disposed to surround the rear shell portion 22, and will not conceal the intermediate viewing-window portion 25 to obstruct viewing of flashback blood flow. As shown in Fig. 3, the left and right access hole portions 127 are disposed in the vicinity of the retained end 221 in the position of use.<br>
The catheter connection assembly 4 includes a catheter hub 42 and a flexible tubular catheter 43.<br>
The tip protector 10 is removably sleeved on the surrounding barrel wall 12 for shielding the needle cannula 41.<br>
The easy release unit 3 includes an engaging wall segment 31, left and right squeezed wall segments 32, and left and right latch members 33.<br>
The engaging wall segment 31 is configured to wrap about the outer barrel wall surface of the larger-diameter wall portion 123, and terminates at two boundary junctions 310. The engaging wall segment 31 has an engaging hole 311 to engage the engaging peg 13 so as to retain the engaging wall segment 31 on the larger-diameter wall portion 123, as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are disposed<br><br>
10<br>
outboard to the outer barrel wall surface to be fitted in the first annular groove 151 to thereby guard the easy release member 3 against displacement in the longitudinal direction, and are opposite to each other in a first direction transverse to the longitudinal direction . In this embodiment, the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 extend respectively from the boundary junctions 310 in the second direction transverse to both the longitudinal direction and the first direction, to respectively terminate at left and right joint regions 321. The left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are made of a flexible material such that, upon being squeezed towards each other in the first transverse direction to thereby be placed in an actuated position, where the left and right joint regions 321 are closer to each other, each of the left and right wall segments 32 acquires a biasing force which biases the left and right wall segments 32 towards a normal position, where the left and right joint regions 321 are remote from each other.<br>
The left and right latch members 33 are elongated to respectively have left proximate and distal segments 331, 332 opposite to each other, and right proximate and distal segments 331,332 opposite to each other. The left and right latch members 33 have left and right latch bodies 330, which are respectively interposed between the left proximate and distal segments 331,332, and between the right proximate and distal segments 331,332.<br>
The left and right proximate segments 331 are disposed<br><br>
11<br>
to couple respectively with the right and left joint regions 321 by left and right transit segments 34 such that the left and right proximate segments 331 are respectively moved with the right and left joint regions 321 in the first direction. The left and right proximate segments 331 are bent to form left and right overlapping portions 3311 which extend in the first direction, and which overlap each other in the second direction. As shown in Fig. 4, the guiding spacer 171 extends towards the left and right overlapping portions 3311 and in the longitudinal direction such that the left and right overlapping portions 3311 are guided to move in the first direction when the left and right joint regions 321 are moved between the normal and actuated positions. The left and right distal segments 332 are fitted in the second annular groove 152 to guard the left and right latch members 33 against displacement in the longitudinal direction. The left and right distal segments 332 respectively have left and right fingers 333 which are respectively distal from the left and right latch bodies 330 and which extend in the first direction such that the left and right fingers 333 are moved with the right and left squeezed wall segments 32 in the first direction to be close to and away from each other. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, when the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are in the normal position, the left and right fingers 333 extend respectively through the left and right access hole portions 127 to the passage 11 so as to hold the retained end 221<br><br>
12<br>
of the rear shell portion 22 of the needle hub 2 against the biasing action of the biasing member 5.<br>
In use, the tip end 412 of the needle cannula 41 is inserted into the patient's vein so as to introduce the tubular catheter 43 into the vein. Blood flowing into the blood-flow passage 201 is visible so that the user can check whether the needle cannula 41 has been inserted properly into the vein. The user can then separate the catheter hub 42 from the barrel 1 with one finger of the hand that holds the barrel 1 . Subsequently, the user can press the vein and the tubular catheter 43 with the other hand to complete the IV catheter introducing procedure. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, when the user symmetrically squeezes the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 to the actuated position, the left and right distal segments 332 are moved simultaneously away from each other in the first direction such that the left and right fingers 333 are moved away from the passage 11 to steer clear of the retained end 221 of the rear shell portion 22 to thereby permit the biasing member 5 to bias the rear shell portion 22 towards the rear position. Hence, the needle cannula 41 is moved smoothly to the disposal position to retreat into the passage 11, as shown in Fig.7.<br>
Moreover, once the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are squeezed towards the outer barrel wall surface of the barrel 1, the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 aremovedoverthe left andright thresholdbarriers 141,153, and are deformed so as to be urged into the left and right<br><br>
1 3<br>
retaining pits (151a) immediately after slipping over the left and right threshold barriers 141,153. Thus, the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are retained in the actuated position, thereby preventing reuse.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 to 11, the second preferred embodiment of an intravenous catheter introducing device according to this invention is shown to be similar to the first embodiment in construction. The difference resides in that the outer barrel wall surface of the larger-diameter wall portion 123 has an elongated slot 19 which extends through the inner barrel wall surface and which is elongated from an access hole 192 rearwardly to terminate at a restricted hole 191. In addition, the needle hub 2 further includes a retained peg 23 which extends from the rear shell portion 22 and which is configured to extend through the access hole 192 such that the retained peg 23 is guarded by the left and right fingers 333 of the left and right latch members 33 against the biasing action of the biasing member 5 to hold the rear shell portion 22 in the front position. Moreover, when the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are in the actuated position, i.e., the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 are squeezed towards each other, the left and right fingers 333 are moved away from each other to permit sliding movement of the retained peg 23 along the elongated slot 19 to the restricted hole 191 so as to move the rear shell portion 22 to the rear position. The end cap 18 is disposed to receive the retained peg 23 therein when<br><br>
1 4<br>
the retained peg 23 is moved into the restricted hole 191 so as to disable the needle hub 2, i.e. , to prevent the needle hub 2 from being moved back to the front position for reuse, as shown in Figs. 12 and 13.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Figs. 9 and 11, the easy release unit 3 of this embodiment is slightly different from that of the first embodiment. The engaging wall segment 31 of the easy release unit 3 is configured to wrap about the outer barrel wall surface of the barrel 1, and terminates at two boundary junctions 310. The left and right squeezed wall segments 32 extend respectively from the boundary junctions 310 in the second direction. The left and right proximate segments 331 of the left and right latch members 33 are bent to form left and right overlapping portions 3311, respectively, which extend in the first direction and which are respectively and integrally formed with the right and left joint regions 321. The easy release member 3 further has a guiding member which includes a key slot 334 that is formed in the right overlapping portions 3311 and that is elongated in the first direction, and a key 335 that is disposed on the left overlapping portion 3311 and that is slidable along the key slot 334 so as to ensure movement of the left and right overlapping portions 3311 in the first direction. The left and right distal segments 332 are disposed opposite to the left and right proximate segments 331 in the longitudinal direction, and are spaced apart from each other in the first direction to accommodate the retained<br><br>
1 5<br>
peg 23 so as to permit the left and right fingers 333 to hold the retained peg 23 in the front position. Moreover, the larger-diameter wall portion 123 has a flat guiding surface 172 which extends radially and inwardly of the outer barrel wall surface so as to guide movement of the left and right distal segments 332 mounted thereon.<br>
Referring to Figs. 14 to 18, the third preferred embodiment of an intravenous catheter introducing device according to this invention is shown to be similar to the second embodiment in construction. The difference resides in that the engaging wall segment 31 of the easy release unit 3 is ring-shaped, is sleeved on the outer barrel wall surface of the barrel 1, and has a surrounding edge 312 surrounding the axis. The left and right squeezed wall segments 32 extend from the surrounding edge 312 in the longitudinal direction. The larger-diameter wall portion 123 has a flat guiding surface 172 which extends radially of the outer barrel wall surface so as to guide the movement of the left and right distal segments 332 mounted thereon. During operation, the user can hold the barrel 2 with one hand and operate the left and right squeezed wall segments 32 with the same hand to cause the needle hub 2 to move to the rear position for drawing the used needle cannula 41 into the passage 11. As illustrated, the operation is controllable bytheuserandis convenient to conduct. Besides , undesirable accidents can be avoided. In addition, since the easy release unit 3 is formed by punching a flexible<br><br>
16<br>
metal material, and is sleeved on the outer barrel surface of the barrel 1, the device of this invention has a simple construction, is easy to fabricate, and is compact in size.<br><br>
