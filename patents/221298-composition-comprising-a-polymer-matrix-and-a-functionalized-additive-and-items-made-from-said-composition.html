COMPOSITION COMPRISING A POLYMER MATRIX AND A FUNCTIONALIZED ADDITIVE AND ITEMS MADE FROM SAID<br>
COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising at least one polymer matrix and at least one functionalized additive obtained by the reaction of a mixture of compounds comprising at least one polyfunctional compound and at least one functionalized homofunctional compound. The composition according to the invention makes it possible in particular to manufacture yarns, fibers, films, filaments and molded articles.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Polymers are raw materials that can be converted by transfer  molding,  injection molding,  injection-blow molding, extrusion, extrusion/blow molding or spinning, especially into numerous articles such as, for example, body parts, which are blow-molded, extruded or transfer molded, yarns, fibers or films.<br>
There are at least two major constraints in all these polymer conversion processes.<br>
The first of these constraints is that the thermoplastic polymers used have to be characterized, in the melt state, by a viscosity or a theological behavior compatible with the abovementioned forming processes. This is because such thermoplastic polymers, when they are in the melt, have to be fluid enough to be able to be easily and rapidly conveyed and handled in certain forming machines.<br>
The other constraint that weighs on thermoplastic polymer compositions is associated with the mechanical properties  that  they must  have  after  having been<br><br>
melted, formed and hardened by cooling. In particular, these mechanical properties are the impact strength, the flexural or tensile modulus, the flexural or tensile strength, among others. Moreover, it is common practice, in order to improve the mechanical properties of thermoplastic polymers, to add reinforcing fillers to them, for example mineral, glass or carbon fillers, in order to form composite materials.<br>
One of the technical problems arising when faced with these two constraints is that they are a priori conflicting. This is because, to reduce the melt viscosity, it is well known to select thermoplastic polymers having low molecular weights. However, this rheological advantage is to the detriment of the mechanical properties of the polymer when formed and hardened.<br>
To try to correct this, it is also common practice to incorporate, into thermoplastic polymer matrices, various additives suitable for modifying their melt rheology. These additives are all the more useful when the polymers contain reinforcing fillers.<br>
The dilemma that arises with these additives is that they have to be both inert or no reactive with the matrix, in order not to cause profound changes to the chemical structure, for example crosslinking, while still being able to be dispersed in this matrix in order to provide it with the required functionalities, and to do so uniformly.<br>
However, the first requirement, of nonreactivity, would have more of a tendency to employ additives that are not compatible with the matrix, whereas the second requirement, of dispersibility, would encourage a person skilled in the art to use instead additives having a structure compatible with that of the matrix.<br><br>
Moreover, rheology-modifying additives must be capable of improving the capability of the thermoplastic polymer to be compression molded, injection molded or extruded.<br>
There is consequently a need to develop additives that are capable of modifying the rheological behavior of thermoplastic matrices and enable the mechanical properties to be maintained. It is also desirable to have additives capable of being able to modify the hydrophobicity and/or hydrophilicity of a polymer matrix without compromising the rheology and the mechanical properties of the compositions.<br>
International Application WO 02/066716 relates to a process for manufacturing polyamide yarns and fibers, consisting in melt blending a linear polyamide with a star-type polyamide. The copolyamide obtained makes it possible to improve the yield in the spinning process and to avoid breakages.<br>
International Application WO 03/002668 relates to the preparation of a star polyamide functionalized by a polyalkylene oxide block and its addition to a polyamide matrix so as to improve the hydrophilicity and antistatic behavior of the composition obtained.<br>
However, the additives used do not allow a good compromise to be achieved between the rheology, the mechanical properties, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to functionalized additives, including chain stopper compounds. These functionalized additives are incorporated into a polymer matrix, especially so as to modify the rheological behavior,  the hydrophilicity and/or the<br><br>
hydrophobicity of said matrix.<br>
One of the essential objectives of the present invention is to propose an additive that modifies the rheological behavior, the hydrophilicity and/or the hydrophobicity of the polymer matrix, preferably a thermoplastic matrix, without compromising the mechanical properties, and in particular the impact strength, of said formed and hardened matrix.<br>
Preferably, these additives do not react with the polymer matrix, advantageously made of a polyamide, that is to say they are not capable of modifying the chemical structure on the polymer matrix, which would for example result in a reduction in the molecular weight of the matrix.<br>
The composition according to the invention has a melt flow index suitable for transfer molding and injection molding operations, for example allowing complete filling of a mold. The composition according to the invention is thus suitable for various melt-forming techniques, namely injection molding, injection-blow molding, extrusion-blow molding, film forming, extrusion and spinning, and also having a high mechanical strength and possibly good transparency due to low crystalloid.<br>
This polymer composition possesses the melt rheology and mechanical properties required in the industry for conversion of these polymers, without the incorporation of additives, carried out in order to improve these properties, being excessively expensive and disturbing be other properties of the polymer.<br>

Preferably, the composition according to the invention contains no functionalized additives that cause a reduction in the molecular weight of the polymer matrix of 2 0% or more compared with a control composition comprising the same polymer matrix but without the addition of the additive of the invention, the molecular weight being measured according to a defined protocol P. The details of the protocol P for measuring the molecular weight are given in the examples below. According to the invention, the functionalized additive therefore is advantageously characterized by an ability to modify the rheological behavior of a polymer matrix, without compromising its structural integrity, and in particular without consequently reducing its molecular weight. This means that the additive seems not to react with the matrix. According to the present invention, the molecular weight is defined as the maximum of the molecular weight distribution of the polymer matrix to which the functionalized additive has been added, in polystyrene equivalents, measured by GPC (gel permeation chromatography) with refractometric detection, as defined in the protocol P given in detail below.<br>
The molecular weight is measured on the composition to be analyzed and on the control composition, these being extruded, solidified and optionally granulated.<br>
The abovementioned protocol P for measuring the molecular weight of the matrix M in a composition to be analyzed and in a control composition, involves an extrusion, resulting in the production of extruded rods. The rods (cut up beforehand into granules) then undergo the actual molecular weight determination. This protocol P for measuring the molecular weight of the compositions according to the invention and the control compositions is the following:<br><br>
1)	Polymer     matrix/functionalized     additive<br>
compositions:<br>
The polymer matrix, especially a polyamide matrix, and<br>
the functionalized additive are in ground or crushed<br>
form,  as powder,  flakes or granules,  and are then<br>
preblended.<br>
The  blend  is  then  introduced  into  a  twin-screw<br>
extruder.<br>
This blend is melted in the extruder at a temperature T<br>
about 3 0°C above the melting point Tm of the polymer<br>
matrix.<br>
The M/functionalized additive blend is thus homogenized<br>
for 5 minutes and rods are recovered at the exit of the<br>
extruder,  which  are  then  granulated.  The  actual<br>
molecular weight measurement is carried out on the<br>
granules  by  derivatization  of  the  polyamide  by<br>
trifluoroacetic anhydride, with respect to polystyrene<br>
standards.   The   detection   technique   used   is<br>
refractrometry;<br>
2)	Polymatrix control compositions containing no<br>
functionalized additive:<br>
For each given M/functionalized additive composition, the molecular weight of the same polymer matrix is measured on a composition comprising the polymer matrix but not the functionalized additive.<br>
The method is carried out on polymer granules, especially polyamide granules obtained in the same manner as that indicated at point 1 above, except that the granules contain no functionalized additive.<br>

the following polymers or copolymers: polyacrylamide,<br>

polymerization products of diols, such as glycerol,<br>
trimethylolpropane, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, sorbitol,<br>

compounds of the same family, with polyisocyanates,<br>
such as 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6-tolylene<br>
diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate,<br>
1,6-hexamethylene	diisocyanate,<br>
4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and compounds of the same family; polysulfones, such as the products of reaction between a sodium salt of 2, 2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and 4,4'-dichloro-dipheryl sulfone; furan resins, such as poly(furan); cellulose ester plastics, such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose propionate and polymers of the same family; silicones, such as poly(dimethylsiloxane), poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-phenylmethylsiloxane) and Dolvmers of the same family;<br><br>

The particularly preferred polymers for forming the polymer matrix are chosen from the group comprising: polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polypropylene terephthalate (PPT), (meth)acrylate-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS), polyacetal (POM), polyamides, semiaromatic polyamides, such as polyphthalamide (AMODEL) or polyarylamide (IXEF), polypropylene oxide (PPO), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as well as copolymers and/or blends thereof.<br>

To improve the mechanical properties of the composition according to the invention, it may be advantageous to add to it at least one reinforcing and/or bulking /filler chosen from the group comprising fibrous fillers, such as glass fibers, mineral fillers such as clays or kaolin, or reinforcing nanoparticles or those made of a thermosetting material, and powdered fillers such as talc.<br>
The degree of reinforcing filler incorporation is in accordance with the standards in the field of composites. It may for example be a filler content of 1 to 90%, preferably 10 to 70% and more specifically between 30 and 60%.<br>
The functionalized additives may furthermore be combined with other reinforcing additives, such as toughness modifiers, such as optionally grafted elastomers.<br>
The composition according to the invention may also contain any other appropriate additives or adjuvants, for example bulking fillers {Si02) , fire retardants, UV stabilizers, heat stabilizers, delustrants (TiOa) , lubricants, plasticizers, compounds used for catalysis in the synthesis of the polymer matrix, antioxidants, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, molding aids or surfactants.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing an additive, said additive being obtained by the reaction of a blend of compounds comprising at<br><br>
least the following: a polyfunctional compound of general formula (I); optionally, a difunctional monomer of general formula (II) or the corresponding cyclic form; and a monofunctional compound of general formula (III), in which: R’ and R’, X and Y, n and R’ are defined as above.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be used as raw material in the field of technical plastics, for example for the production of molded articles, by injection molding or injection-blow molding, extruded articles, by conventional extrusion or by extrusion blow molding, or films.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also be formed by melt spinning into yarns, fibers or filaments.<br>
Preferably, a functionalized star polyamide additive is used, this being introduced into a thermoplastic, preferably polyamide, matrix. To introduce the functionalized additive of the invention into the polymer matrix, any known method for introducing compounds into a matrix may be used.<br>
A first method may consist in blending the additive into the molten matrix and optionally subjecting the blend to a high degree of shearing, for example in a twin-extruder, so as to produce good dispersion. Such an extruder is generally placed upstream of the means for forming the molten plastic (molding, spinning). According to a standard method of implementation, this blend is extruded in the form of rods that are then cut into granules. The molded parts are then produced by melting the granules produced above and feeding the composition in the melt state into transfer molding, injection molding or spinning devices.<br>
For the manufacture of yarns, fibers and filaments, the<br><br>
composition obtained at the exit of the extruder is optionally fed directly into a spinning unit.<br>
A second method may be that which consists in blending the functionalized additive with the monomers of the polymer matrix, before or during polymerization.<br>
According to a variant, an additive concentrate in a polymer matrix, prepared for example according to one of the methods described above may be blended into the polymer matrix.<br>
In general, from 0.1 to 2 0% by weight, preferably 1 to 15% by weight, particularly 1 to 10% by weight and more particularly between 3 and 6% by weight of functionalized additive according to the invention is added to the polymer matrix.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the aim of the present invention is to produce articles obtained by forming, preferably by transfer molding, injection molding, injection-blow molding, extrusion, extrusion-blow molding or spinning, one of the compositions as defined above.<br>
These articles may be yarns, fibers, films or filaments.<br>
They may also be articles molded from the composition according to the invention and optionally reinforcing fibers, such as glass fibers.<br>
The articles according to the invention may be obtained from several compositions according to the invention, such as those defined above. An article may also be obtained from a composition comprising several different additives according to the invention.<br>
The subject of the invention is also the use as agent<br><br>
for modifying the rheological behavior, the hydrophilicity and/or the hydrophocibity of a polymer matrix of a functionalized additive as defined above.<br>

exception of polyalkylene oxides. For example, it is possible to use a "chain stopper" monofunctional compound of formula (III) chosen from the group consisting of: a monoamine or monocarboxylic acid organophosphorus compound, such as aminomethylphosphonic acid; a monoamine or monocarboxylic acid organosulfone compound, such as sulfanilic acid and sulfobenzoic acid; a monoamine or monocarboxylic acid quaternary ammonium compound, such as betaine; and/or blends thereof.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
Example 1<br>
The reaction was carried out in a 500 ml glass reactor commonly used in the laboratory for the melt synthesis of polyesters or polyamides. The following were introduced into the reactor: 238.1 g of octadecylamine (0.90 mol), 61.9 g of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (0.30 mol), 0.16 g of Ultranox® 236 from GE Specialty Chemicals and 0.29 g of a 50% (w/w) aqueous solution of hypophosphorous acid. The reactor was then swept with<br><br>
dry nitrogen.<br>
The reaction mass was mechanically stirred at 50 rpm and gradually heated from 90°C to 250° over about 150 minutes. This temperature was then maintained until the end of the reaction. After maintaining these conditions for one hour, the system was gradually evacuated, to reach a pressure of 15 mbar in 10 minutes, and then maintained under vacuum for a further two hours thirty minutes. Finally, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature and opened, to recover about 280 g of star.<br>
Differential thermal analysis (10°C/min) showed a melting peak at 58.4°C. Gel permeation chromotrography characterization (eluant: dichloromethane + 2/1000 trifluoroacetic anhydride + 0.005M tetrabutylammonium fluoroborate) showed a narrow peak corresponding to Mw = 1450 g/mol and Mn = 1300 g/mol (the weights being expressed relative to polystyrene standards).<br>

After maintaining these conditions for one hour, the system was progressively evacuated, reaching a pressure of 2 0 mbar in one hour, and then maintained under vacuum for a further one hour. Finally, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature and then opened, to recover about 2 00 g of star. Differential  thermal  analysis  (10°C/min)  showed  a<br><br>

Example 7;<br>
The star additives of Examples 2 and 5 were coarsely<br>
ground and preblended in the desired proportions with<br>
granules of PA-6,6.<br>

Measurement of the reductions in pack pressure (of the spinneret head) when spinning PA-6,6/star compositions of Examples 1 and 2<br>
The nylon-6,6 used was one containing no titanium dioxide, with a relative viscosity of 2.5 (measured at a concentration of 10 g/1 in 96% sulfuric acid) . The<br><br>
star was incorporated into the PA-6,6 by powder blending followed by melt blending using a twin-screw extruder. The blend was then melt spun with a velocity at the first take-off point of 800 m/min, so as to obtain a continuous multifilament yarn of 90 dtex per 10 filaments.<br>

Characterization of the behavior with respect to water of the PA-6,6/Star yarn specimens of Examples 1 and 2 This characterization was carried out by capillary imbibition of water into the multifilament consisting of  10  strands.  A  non-cylindrical  capillary  forms between the strands  (typically three  strands)  into which water can rise with a contact angle 0 between the water and the strand. This angle 9 is characteristic of the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the yarn surface. Principle  of  the  measurement  (ref.:  A. Perwuelz, P. Mondon and C. Caze, J. Textile Res., 2A{4) ,    333, 2 000) . The penetration of a liquid into a capillary network is governed by the competition between the capillary  forces  and  the  force  of  gravity.  The capillary network was formed here between the strands of  the  multifilament  modeled  as  an  assembly  of cylindrical capillaries having an equivalent radius R. Washburn's law applies:<br>
h’ = (RYcos0/2r|)t in which:<br>
h is the height (in m) to which the liquid has risen;<br>
t is the time (in s);<br>
R is the radius (in m) of the capillary;<br>
T) is the viscosity (in Pa.s) of the liquid;<br>
Y is the surface tension (in N/m) of the liquid; and<br>
0 is the contact angle between the liquid and the solid.<br>
The filaments were compared with one another using the same liquid - water - for the imbibition. Therefore y and r\ were the same for each specimen, as was R, by construction of the multifilaments. The cos0 values and therefore the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the various multifilaments were compared using the following formula:<br>
h’ = (A cose)t<br><br>
where A is a constant.<br>
The multifilaments studied all consisted of 10 strands of about 30 |j,m. They were not sized. The yarns were conditioned at least 48 hours before the start of the experiments under controlled temperature/moisture conditions (22°C/50% relative humidity).<br>
The setup used to visualize the imbibition, shown in figure 1, was the following: the yarn to be tested formed by a multifilament was tensioned using a system of pulleys and two 20 g masses attached at each end of the yarn. The yarn was dipped into a solution of colored water so as to visualize the imbibition. The dye chosen, which did not interact with the polyamide, was methylene blue with a concentration of 0.2%. The capillary rise was filmed by a camera connected to a video recorder and to a screen provided with a timer. The zero time in the experiment corresponded to the moment when the yarn was dipped into the colored solution (figures 2a and 2b).<br>
For all the yarns tested, a check was made that the imbibition kinetics obeyed Washburn's law for the first two minutes of the capillary rise. The regression coefficient obtained for the straight line h’ = f(t) was always greater than 0.99. Consequently, the various multifilaments tested could all be modeled by an assembly of capillaries having the same radius R. To compare them, it was then sufficient to compare the slopes of the straight line h’ = f (t) .<br>
The results obtained for the control yarns and the yarns with additives, averaged over 5 to 7 experiments, are given in Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3<br><br>

	Example 2	<br><br>

This shows that the slope of the straight line h’ = f(t) is substantially smaller for the yarns containing alkyl functionalized star polyamides, which means a lower cosG, i.e. a larger wetting angle 6. The ‘'‘ yarns containing functionalized star polyamides are therefore more hydrophobic on the surface than the PA-6,6 control yarn.<br>
Measurement of the reductions in pack pressure (of the spinneret head) when spinning compositions consisting of high-MW PA-6/stars of Examples 3 to 6 The nylon-6 used was a high-MW PA-6 containing no titanium dioxide, with a relative viscosity of 4.0 (measured for a concentration of 10 g/1 in 96% sulfuric acid).<br>
The star was incorporated into the high-MW PA-6 by powder blending and then melt blending using a twin-screw extruder. The blend was then melt spun with a velocity at the first take-up point of 500 m/min, so as to obtain a multifilament continuous yarn of 220 dtex per 10 filaments.<br>
The spinning temperature/pressure and operating conditions and the properties of the yarns obtained are given below:<br>
spinning operation: no breakage;<br>
spinneret pressure: 35 bar;<br>
twin-screw extruder heating: 315°C;<br>
spinneret head heating: 2 96°C. The multifilament or yarn consisted of 10 strands (the spinneret having 10 holes) and the strand diameter was about 50 |J,m.<br>
The reductions in pack pressure (spinneret head) were measured using a Dynisco (0-350 bar) pressure probe. The results obtained are given in Table 4 below.<br><br>

Characterization of the behavior with respect to water<br>
of yarn specimens consisting of high-MW PA-6/stars of<br>
Examples 3 to 5<br>
This  characterization  was  performed  by  capillary<br>
imbibition of water into multifilaments consisting of<br>
10 strands, according to the same protocol as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
The results obtained for the control yarns and the<br>
yarns with additive, averaged over 3 to 5 experiments,<br>
are given in Table 5 below.<br><br>
Specimen	Average slope and standard deviation (mm’/s)<br>
Control high-MW PA-6	20,9 ± 12.3<br>
High-MW PA-6 + 5% alkyl star of Example 3	0 (no capillary rise detectable)<br>
High-MW PA-6 + 5% alkyl star of Example 4	0.007 ± 0.002<br>
High-MW PA-6 + 5% alkyl star of Example 5	4.1 ± 1.9<br>
It may be seen that the slope of the straight line h’ = f(t) is substantially smaller for the yarns containing alkyl functionalized star polyamides, which means a lower cos0, i.e. a larger wetting angle 0. The yarns containing alkyl functionalized star polyamides are therefore more hydrophobic on the surface than the high-MW PA-6 control yarn.<br><br><br>
