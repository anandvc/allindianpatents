				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for the early detection of infection with dengue flavivirus in human serum or plasma or whole blood.<br>
It is an improved version of the patent "2484/DEL/2007: A device and a kit for analyzing the presence of anti dengue IgM and anti dengue IgG in a sample and process thereof which is pending in Indian Patent office.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to the simultaneous and differential detection of dengue NSl antigen and dengue antibodies present in human serum or plasma or whole blood. Further more the subject invention allows one to detect dengue antigens in early acute stage of infection even prior to the development of antibodies thereby allowing early detection of the disease.<br>
More specifically, the subject invention relates to a rapid diagnostic kit for the detection of dengue NSl antigen and dengue antibodies present in human serum or plasma or whole blood.<br>
It is a visual, rapid, sensitive and accurate immunoassay for the rapid and differential detection of dengue antigen and dengue antibodies in human serum or plasma or whole blood.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes and caused by four serotypes of dengue virus (DEN): DEN: 1, DEN: 2, DEN: 3 and DEN: 4. Dengue fever is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans and according to the World Health Organisation estimates, its incidence has increased by a factor of 30 over the last 50 years.<br><br>
Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by Stegomyia aegypti (formerly Aedes aegypti) mosquitoes and cause a wide range of symptoms from unapparent or mild disease to severe haemorrhagic form.<br>
The infection agent, dengue virus has a simple stranded RNA with positive polarity which comprises of nucleotides and poly protein amino acids. It is separated into structural and non structural proteins. The structural proteins are C, prM and E and the nonstructural proteins are NSl, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5. NSl a non structural protein was identified for the first time in 1970.<br>
NSl is a highly conserved glycoprotein which appears essential for the virus viability although no precise function has yet been assigned to it. During the cell infection, NSl is found associated with intracellular organelles or is alternatively transported through the secretory pathway to the cell surface. A soluble hexameric form may be released in a glycosylation-dependent fashion from infected mammalian cells but not from vector derived mosquito cells.<br>
Dengue virus infection is currently detected by means of several biological tests. Virus isolation on mosquito cells, viral RNA detection by reverse transcription - PCR (RT-PCR) or serological tests such as immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA). RT-PCR remains expensive and its routine use in the clinical diagnostic laboratories is difficult. Commercial MAC-ELISA kits are available but they cannot be used for early diagnosis, because IgM does not become detectable until 5 to 10 days after the onset of illness in secondary infection.<br>
In primary infection, IgM and IgG arise approximately 5 and 14 days respectively after symptoms onset. In secondary infection, IgM levels are low or undetectable while IgG arise 1-2 days after symptoms onset with higher levels than in primary infection. More recently, detection in patient's sera of circulating dengue virus in nonstructural protein NSl has been described as an alternative method for early diagnosis. NSl antigens were found circulating from the first day and up to 9 days after the onset of fever with<br><br>
comparable levels observe in primary and secondary infection. Dengue virus specific IgM first appeared at about day 3 and was prominent from day 5 onward. IgM did not seem to interfere with NS1 detection during the clinical phase.<br>
There is no commercially available vaccine against the dengue virus. In the absence of vaccine, it is necessary to monitor epidemics. To do this, active monitoring programs have in particular been set up by the World Health organization. It essentially comprises the monitoring of cases of fever and of vector insects and the serological and virological screening of individuals having a fever and suspected of being infected with the dengue virus.<br>
The present invention is a device for early and rapid detection of dengue in human serum or plasma or whole blood. Dengue NS1 antigen can be detected during the acute and the symptomatic phase of dengue. Antibodies to dengue can be detected during the entire period of infection.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US 2005186562 (Al) The invention concerns a method for early detection of a flavivirus-induced infection, comprising the detection of the flavivirus non-structural glycoprotein NS1 in a biological sample during the clinical phase of the infection, by an immumological method using at least two identical or different antibodies, the first antibody consisting of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies pre-selected for their high affinity for said NS 1 protein hexameric in shape.<br>
US 5824506: Peptide antigens derived from the dengue virus type-2 glycoprotein NS1 are provided. The peptide antigens are specifically immunoreactive with sera from individuals infected with the dengue virus. The antigens are useful as diagnostic tools in determining whether an individual has been or is infected with dengue virus, and for discriminating between infection with dengue virus and infection with related flaviviruses. The antigens are also useful in vaccine compositions for immunizing individuals against infection with the dengue virus.<br><br>
WO 2003/048184 A3: The present invention relates to NS1 proteins or parts thereof of Flaviviruses, in particular of Dengue viruses useful for vaccination against said Flavivirus and against one or more other Flaviviruses. The invention further concerns the NS1 protein or parts thereof of one Dengue virus serotype, in particular serotype 2, useful for vaccination against Dengue viruses from all serotypes. The invention further concerns DNA comprising an expression cassette coding for a Flavivirus NS1 or parts thereof, vectors, comprising said DNA and vaccines containing or expressing a Flavivirus NS1.<br>
