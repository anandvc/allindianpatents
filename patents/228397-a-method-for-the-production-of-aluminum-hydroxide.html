				<td>ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, MADE VIA THE BAYER PROCESS,<br>
WITH LOW ORGANIC CARBON<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the Bayer Process and more specifically<br>
relates to a method for removing total organic carbon from aluminum hydroxide that<br>
has been produced using the Bayer process and the aluminum hydroxide produced<br>
using this method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aluminum hydroxide, also known as alumina trihydrate, is the precursor of<br>
many alumina-based products, including calcined alumina used for making metallic<br>
aluminum by reduction. Aluminum hydroxide is most commonly obtained from<br>
alumina-containing ores, such as bauxite. Recovery of the alumina content of bauxite is<br>
generally accomplished by the well-known Bayer process which involves the digestion<br>
of the bauxite with a caustic medium at elevated temperatures and pressures. Digestion<br>
of the bauxite results in a saturated sodium aluminate liquor, commonly referred to as<br>
"pregnant liquor" from which the alumina content is recovered by precipitation, usually<br>
through addition of seed aluminum hydroxide.<br>
In the Bayer process for the production of alumina, bauxite ore is pulverized,<br>
slurried in water, and then digested with caustic soda, also known as sodium hydroxide,<br>
at elevated temperatures and pressures. The caustic solution dissolves oxides of<br>
aluminum, forming an aqueous sodium aluminate solution. The caustic-insoluble<br>
constituents of bauxite ore, referred to as "red mud", are then separated from the<br>
aqueous phase containing the dissolved sodium aluminate. Solid aluminum hydroxide<br>
is precipitated out of the solution and collected as product.<br><br>
In more detail, the pulverized bauxite ore is fed to a slurry mixer where a water<br>
slurry is prepared. The slurry makeup water is typically spent liquor (described below)<br>
and added caustic soda. This bauxite ore slurry is then diluted and passed through a<br>
digester or a series of digesters where, under high pressure and temperature, about 98%<br>
of the total available alumina is released from the ore as caustic-soluble sodium<br>
aluminate. After digestion, the slurry passes through several flash tanks wherein the<br>
pressure of the digested slurry is reduced from several atmospheres to one atmosphere<br>
and the temperature of the slurry is reduced from about 200° C to about 105° C.<br>
The aluminate liquor leaving the flashing operation contains from about 1 to<br>
about 20 weight percent solids, consisting of the insoluble residue that remains after, or<br>
is precipitated during, digestion. The coarser solid particles may be removed from the<br>
aluminate liquor with "sand trap" cyclones. The finer solid particles are generally<br>
separated from the liquor first by settling and then by filtration, if necessary. The slurry<br>
of aluminate liquor leaving the flash tanks is diluted by a stream of recycled washer<br>
overflow liquor. Any Bayer process slurry taken from the digesters through any<br>
subsequent dilution of the slurry, including the flash tanks, but before the primary<br>
settler, is referred hereinafter as the primary settler feed.<br>
Normally, the primary settler feed is thereafter fed to the center well of the<br>
primary settler, where it is treated with a flocculant. As the mud settles, clarified<br>
sodium aluminate solution, referred to as "green" or "pregnant" liquor, overflows a weir<br>
at the top of the primary settler and is collected. This overflow from the primary<br>
settling tank is passed to the subsequent process steps.<br>
The clarity of the primary settler overflow is crucial to the efficient processing<br>
of aluminum hydroxide. If the aluminate liquor overflowing the settler contains an<br><br>
unacceptable concentration of suspended solids (at times from about 10 to about 500<br>
mg of suspended solids per liter), it must be further clarified by filtration to give a<br>
filtrate with no more than about 10 mg suspended solids per liter of liquor. The<br>
treatment of the liquor collected after the primary settlement to remove any residual<br>
suspended solids before aluminum hydroxide is recovered is referred to as a secondary<br>
clarification stage.<br>
The clarified sodium aluminate liquor is seeded with aluminum hydroxide<br>
crystals to induce precipitation of alumina in the form of aluminum hydroxide,<br>
A1(OH)3. The aluminum hydroxide particles or crystals are then separated from the<br>
concentrated caustic liquor, and the remaining liquid phase, the spent liquor, is returned<br>
to the initial digestion step and employed as a digestant after reconstitution with caustic.<br>
Bauxite is found in many parts of the world and the composition of the ores may<br>
vary from place to place. Many bauxites contain organic carbon (also referred to as<br>
"organic impurities") that will be co-extracted with the alumina content of the ore<br>
during digestion and will contaminate the produced liquor. Most of the organic carbon<br>
content found in the ores consists of high molecular weight compounds, a portion of<br>
which will decompose to lower molecular weight compounds during the caustic<br>
digestion process, thereby producing a whole spectrum of organic salts dissolved in the<br>
liquor. Since the Bayer process involves extensive recycling of the used caustic liquor<br>
to the digestion stage, the organic carbon content of the liquor will continuously<br>
increase, reaching levels ranging from about 5 grams carbon/liter of liquor to about 40<br>
grams carbon/liter of liquor depending on the type of bauxite being processed. The<br>
accumulation of organic carbon content can reach such high levels so as to seriously<br>
interfere with the economic and efficient production of aluminum hydroxide with an<br><br>
organic carbon content low enough so that the aluminum hydroxide can be used for<br>
applications requiring a low total organic carbon content.<br>
Since the control of organic carbon levels in Bayer process liquors is an<br>
important facet in the production of aluminum hydroxide, several methods have already<br>
been developed for such organic carbon level control. It has been suggested in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,046,855 (Schepers et al.) that organic impurities can be removed from<br>
Bayer process liquors by contacting the liquor with a magnesium compound which will<br>
form a precipitated mixture of magnesium and aluminum hydroxides. This precipitate,<br>
according to the patent, can remove some of the organic impurities either by adsorption<br>
or by chemisorption. The magnesium compound may be added at any stage of the<br>
Bayer process, additions prior to digestion or to the digested slurry are preferred.<br>
Although this process is capable of removing at least a portion of the organic<br>
impurities, the formation of a precipitated hydroxide mixture creates operational<br>
difficulties. On the one hand, the precipitated hydroxide mixture will contain<br>
aluminum hydroxide and this results in product alumina loss; on the other hand, the<br>
precipitated mixture has to be separated from the rest of the treated liquor and this<br>
involves additional processing steps and/or a definite increase in the quantity of the<br>
total mud load which requires disposal.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 4,101,629 (Mercier et al.), a barium-containing compound is<br>
added to Bayer process liquors. The barium compound precipitates as barium<br>
aluminate and the precipitated material may also include barium salts of organic<br>
impurities present in the liquor. As in the previously discussed patent, this process<br>
involves precipitation of a compound which has to be removed from the treated liquor<br>
requiring settling and/or filtration equipment and additional processing steps. The<br><br>
process allows recovery and reuse of the filtered barium compound by calcination;<br>
however, the well-known toxicity of barium salts may create an unacceptable<br>
environmental and/or health risk not justifiable by the purification results obtainable by<br>
it.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 4,335,082 (Matyasi et al.), organic impurities are removed<br>
from impure Bayer liquors by caustifying the liquor with lime, followed by evaporation<br>
of the causticized liquor. Evaporation will result in the precipitation of solids<br>
containing a large quantity of the organic impurities from the liquor. The solids are<br>
separated and then discarded. This method assures the removal of satisfactory<br>
quantities of organic impurities from the liquor, but the problems associated with the<br>
process render it impractical and expensive. To achieve good purification, large<br>
volumes of liquor have to be treated with lime and evaporated. These liquor treatment<br>
processes involve the use of large quantities of lime and extensive energy input and<br>
large soda value losses. "Soda value" refers to any sodium salt found in Bayer process<br>
liquor. Specifically, soda associated with sodium aluminate, free sodium hydroxide and<br>
sodium carbonate. All of these are derived from a key raw material, caustic soda,<br>
which represents a major raw material cost. Therefore, all Bayer process refineries<br>
operate to minimize the loss of soda value.<br>
A similar purification process is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,280,987<br>
(Yamada et al.). In this process, Bayer liquor is first evaporated, then calcined at high<br>
temperature after its alumina and caustic content is adjusted to a predetermined level.<br>
This process, known in the Bayer industry as "liquor burning," is an effective means of<br>
organic impurity removal. Its disadvantages are associated with the large volumes to be<br>
evaporated and then calcined, which require substantial capital and energy<br><br>
expenditures. Liquor burning also requires air emission control equipment in order to<br>
avoid air pollution issues.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 4,215,094 (Inao et al.), a copper-catalyzed wet oxidation<br>
process is recommended for the oxidation of organic impurities, followed by addition<br>
of a sulfur-containing compound to remove the copper catalyst as a precipitate. The<br>
oxidation is accomplished under elevated temperature and pressure conditions in the<br>
presence of a catalyst and molecular oxygen. This process has several disadvantages in<br>
that a high temperature-pressure digestion has to be applied which involves the use of<br>
expensive pressure vessels and substantial energy usage. In addition, the copper<br>
catalyst has to be removed from the treated liquor to avoid contamination. Disposal of<br>
the removed copper sulfide can create environmental and/or health hazards. Similarly,<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,663,133 (Malito et al.), organic impurities are oxidized at elevated<br>
temperature and pressure by feeding molecular oxygen directly into the bauxite<br>
digestion vessels. The amount of oxygen used is limited to below the solubility of<br>
oxygen in the liquor and is sufficient to destroy only a portion of the organic impurities.<br>
Moreover, there is the potential of explosion due to the high pressures required.<br>
In Japanese Patent No. 53-146,259 (Kazama et al.) various oxidizing agents,<br>
such as sodium peroxide powder and 50% hydrogen peroxide, are used to destroy part<br>
of the organic impurities. Though effective, these reagents are expensive and<br>
hazardous. Also, the color of pregnant Bayer liquor is removed by passing a small<br>
stream of air containing 1% ozone through pregnant Bayer liquor. However, this dilute<br>
ozone stream only removes color and is not sufficient to oxidize any of the organic<br>
impurities.<br><br>
It would be desirable to provide an aluminum hydroxide, made via the Bayer<br>
process, with lower levels of total organic carbon. It also would be desirable if the<br>
process used to provide an aluminum hydroxide, made via the Bayer process, with<br>
lower levels of total organic carbon, did not require high temperature and pressure and<br>
is, relatively speaking, environmentally benign.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first aspect of the instant claimed invention is in a composition of matter<br>
which is aluminum hydroxide, produced using the Bayer Process, the improvement<br>
comprising producing an aluminum hydroxide wherein the Total Organic Carbon of the<br>
aluminum hydroxide is less than about 0.5 milligrams organic carbon/gram aluminum<br>
hydroxide.<br>
Aluminum hydroxide, produced according to the Bayer process, is dispersed in<br>
water to produce a slurry containing from about 50 grams solids/liter of water to about<br>
1000 grams solids/ liter of water, preferably from about 400 grams solids/liter of water<br>
to about 700 grams solids/ liter of water.<br>
The temperature of the slurry should be from about 5°C to about 95°C,<br>
preferably from about 15°C to about 40°C and most preferably from about 20°C to<br>
about 30 °C.<br>
The solids should be maintained in suspension using any appropriate agitation<br>
technique. This includes, but is not limited to, such methods as mechanical agitation in<br>
a batch or continuous tank vessel or a fluidized bed reactor or any other suitable reactor<br>
or by turbulent flow in a continuous pipe-flow reactor.<br>
The pH of the slurry should be basic, greater than about 9, more preferably<br>
greater than about 10 and most preferably greater than about 12. Any suitable base can<br>
be used to raise and maintain the pH of the slurry at the requisite level. Suitable bases<br>
include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, strontium oxide, barium oxide, or their respective<br><br>
hydroxides. The preferred bases are sodium hydroxide, calcium oxide and barium<br>
oxide. The most preferred bases are calcium oxide and barium oxide.<br>
The calcium oxide and barium oxide bases are preferred because they react with<br>
and precipitate the carbonate ion that is ultimately formed during the reaction of ozone<br>
with carbon compounds, according to this generalized sequence of reactions:<br>
O3 + C → CO2+½O2<br>
CO2 + 20H- → CO32- + H2O<br>
M(OH)2 +CO32- → MCO3 + 2OH- (where M = calcium or barium)<br>
Without the removal of the carbonate ion from the water phase, the efficiency of<br>
ozone interaction with aluminum hydroxide is reduced due to the quenching of the<br>
hydroxyl radical. This is because the hydroxyl radical is formed from ozone and it is<br>
the hydroxyl radical which is the reactive species responsible for the oxidation of the<br>
organic compounds in alkaline pH.<br>
A mixture of ozone in oxygen, containing from about 1 wt. % ozone to about 20<br>
.wt.% ozone, is added to the aluminum hydroxide slurry at a temperature of from about<br>
0 °C to about<br>
30 °C, preferably from about 10 °C to about 20 °C. The ozone/oxygen mixture can be<br>
added to the aluminum hydroxide slurry by any conventional method in an amount<br>
which effectively removes organic carbon from the aluminum hydroxide. Typical<br>
equipment which may be used for adding the ozone/oxygen mixture to the aluminum<br>
hydroxide slurry includes, but is not limited to, batch or continuous tank reactors,<br>
packed bed reactors, moving bed reactors, gas diffusers in a mixed tank and any other<br>
device designed for contacting a gas with a liquid or a slurry. This type of equipment is<br><br>
described in Helble, et al., "Advanced Effluent Treatment in the Pulp and Paper<br>
Industry with a Combined Process of Ozonation and Fixed Bed Biofilm Reactors,"<br>
Wat. Sci. Tech. Vol. 40, No. 11-12, pp. 343-350,1999.<br>
After the vessel to hold the aluminum hydroxide slurry has been selected, the<br>
preferred method of contact is to inject the mixture of ozone in oxygen into the slurry<br>
using commercially available ozone in oxygen low-pressure injection equipment.<br>
The amount of ozone/oxygen mixture which is added to the aluminum<br>
hydroxide slurry is dependent upon the particular type of equipment used. The amount<br>
of the ozone/oxygen mixture is typically in the range of from about 0.4 grams of ozone<br>
to about 10 grams of ozone per kilogram of aluminum hydroxide solids. Though it is to<br>
be understood by those skilled in the art that the maximum amount of the ozone/oxygen<br>
mixture which can be added is practically limited only by the amount of ozone that can<br>
be physically absorbed by the slurry.<br>
The ozone remains in contact with the slurry for a time period of from about 10<br>
minutes to about 150 minutes, preferably from about 30 minutes to about 120 minutes<br>
and most preferably from about 60 minutes to about 90 minutes. The amount of time<br>
the ozone remains in contact with the slurry is dependent upon many factors including<br>
the rate of ozone addition into the slurry and the levels of solids in the slurry. The<br>
relatively faster the ozone is added to the slurry, the relatively less the amount of time it<br>
takes to complete the process. Optimization of the rate of addition of ozone to the<br>
slurry and amount of time it takes to adequately remove organic carbon from the<br>
aluminum hydroxide is within the ability of a person of ordinary skill in the art to<br>
determine.<br><br>
At the conclusion of the process the ozone feed is turned off and the solid<br>
aluminum hydroxide is collected from the slurry using any of the typical solids<br>
collection techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, evaporation,<br>
filtration, centrifugation, sedimentation and decantation.<br>
For those intended uses requiring very pure aluminum hydroxide, the aluminum<br>
hydroxide collected from the ozone-treated slurry may be further purified by digesting it<br>
in sodium hydroxide solution followed by precipitation using pure aluminum hydroxide<br>
seed. The process has the following additional steps:<br>
e)	adding the aluminum hydroxide to a solution of sodium hydroxide in<br>
water and allowing the sodium hydroxide to digest the aluminum hydroxide;<br>
f)	adding solid aluminum hydroxide to the solution to begin seeded<br>
precipitation of aluminum hydoxide;<br>
g)	collecting the precipitated aluminum hydroxide, which has a Total<br>
Organic Carbon of less than about 0.2 milligrams organic carbon/gram of aluminum<br>
hydroxide.<br>
Aluminum hydroxide, produced using the Bayer Process and treated with ozone<br>
and then digested and reprecipitated from sodium hydroxide can have a total organic<br>
content of less than about 0.2 milligrams organic carbon/gram of aluminum hydroxide.<br>
The products produced by the described processes are aluminum hydroxides,<br>
produced via the Bayer process, with subsequent processing, wherein the aluminum<br>
hydroxides produced have a Total Organic Carbon of less than about 0.5 milligrams<br>
organic carbon per gram of aluminum hydroxide.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the present invention<br>
and to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the invention. These examples<br>
are not intended to limit the invention or its protection in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
Aluminum hydroxide, produced according to the Bayer process, was dispersed<br>
in water to produce a slurry containing about 442 grams solids/liter of water. The pH<br>
was adjusted to a pH of at least about 12 by the addition of 33% NaOH, at a rate of<br>
about 1 milliliter of 33% NaOH per liter of water in the slurry. The solids were<br>
maintained in suspension by mechanical agitation in a batch tank.<br>
A mixture of ozone in oxygen, containing about 14 wt. % ozone, was injected<br>
into the aluminum hydroxide slurry at a temperature of about 23°C. The ozone was left<br>
in contact with the slurry for about 90 minutes.<br>
The color of the aluminum hydroxide was measured with a Hunter LabScan XE<br>
spectrophotometer, as a function of absorbed ozone. The data are shown in the table.<br>
The Total Organic Carbon was measured by combusting the sample and determining<br>
the amount of carbon dioxide by infrared analysis.<br><br>
Table 1 gives the results.<br>
Total Organic Carbon ("TOC") can be reported in milligrams organic carbon<br>
per gram of aluminum hydroxide or it can be reported in wt. % TOC which is:<br><br><br>
The Hunter Color data indicates that the lowering of total organic carbon is<br>
accompanied by a reduction in color.<br>
Example 2<br>
Aluminum hydroxide, produced according to the Bayer process, was dispersed<br>
in water to produce a slurry containing about 332 g solids/liter of water. The pH was<br>
adjusted to pH 12 by the addition of 33% NaOH, at a rate of about 1 milliliter per liter<br>
of water in the slurry. The water temperature was about 22°C. The solids were<br><br>
maintained in suspension by mechanical agitation in a batch tank reactor. A mixture of<br>
room temperature ozone in oxygen, containing about<br>
13 wt. % ozone, was injected into the aluminum hydroxide slurry. The ozone was left<br>
in contact with the slurry for about 90 minutes. Table 2 gives the results<br><br>
