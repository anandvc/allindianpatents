				<td>COMPOUND FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to mixed metal compounds having pharmaceutical activity, especially as phosphate binders. It also extends to methods of manufacture of those compounds, as well as to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. It further relates to their pharmaceutical use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Historically phosphate binders included aluminium salts. However, use of aluminium salts was found to result in toxic complications due to aluminium accumulation, e.g. reduction in haemoglobin production, impairment in natural repair and production of bone and possible impairment of neurological/cognitive function. Other aluminium compounds such as microcrystalline aluminium oxide hydroxide (boehmite) and certain hyd'rotalcites were proposed for this use, such as disclosed in Ookubo et al, Journal Pharmaceutical Sciences (November 1992), 81 (11), 1139-1140. However these suffer from the same drawbacks.<br>
Calcium carbonate or calcium acetate are now typically used as phosphate binders. However these suffer from the drawback that they tend to promote hypercalcemia through the absorption of high amounts of ingested calcium and are linked to accelerated cardiovascular calcification which can cause serious side effects. Consequently, frequent monitoring of serum calcium levels is required during therapy with calcium-based phosphate binders. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative suggests limiting the use of calcium based salts (Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone Metabolism and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease, Guide 5, pg 1 pt 5.5). Recent efforts, therefore, have focused on the development of phosphate binders free of calcium. More recently, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer HCI have been used as calcium-free phosphate binders. Sevelamer hydrochloride is a water-absorbing, non-absorbed hydrogel-cross-linked polyallylamine hydrochloride but because of its structure also binds certain fat-soluble vitamins and bile acids and is therefore reported in V.<br>
Autissier et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol 96, No 10, October 2007 to require large doses to be effective because it has a higher propensity for the bound phosphate to be displaced by these competing anions. A high pill burden and/or large tablets are often associated with poor patient compliance and this type of product are also considered relatively expensive to their calcium counter parts. Sevelamer has also been associated with gastro intestinal (Gl) adverse effects A.J. Hutchison et al, Drugs 2003; 63 (6), 577-596.<br>
Lanthanum carbonate is a new phosphate binder which has been shown to be as effective as calcium carbonate with lower incidence of hypercalcaemia. Long-term administration of lanthanum, a rare earth element, continues to raise safety concerns with regards to the potential accumulation of a rare earth metal in body tissue which can be enhanced in renal failure - Tilman B Druke, Seminars in Dialysis, Volume 20, Issue 4 page 329-332 July/August 2007.<br>
Many known inorganic preparations for treatment of hyperphosphatemia are efficient phosphate binders only over a limited pH range. Moreover, particularly alkaline binders could buffer the stomach pH up to a high level at which they would not have a phosphate binding capacity.<br>
To overcome the drawbacks associated with aluminium and also problems of efficacy over a limited pH range, WO-A-99/15189 discloses use of mixed metal compounds which are free from aluminium and which have a phosphate binding capacity of at least 30% by weight of the total weight of phosphate present, over a pH range of from 2-8.<br>
Typically, such mixed metal compounds may contain iron (III) and at least one of magnesium, calcium, lanthanum and cerium. Preferably they also contain at least one of hydroxyl and carbonate anions and optionally additionally, at least one of sulphate, nitrate, chloride and oxide. However, mixed metal compounds of WO-A-99/15189 may release some of their magnesium content in soluble form raising serum magnesium levels (Hypermagnesia).<br>
PCT/GB2006/000452 discloses that the release of the divalent metal, e.g. magnesium, associated with the pharmaceutical use of compounds of WO-A-99/15189 can be significantly reduced by heat treatment of a suitable mixed metal compound, for example a layered double hydroxide or a compound having a hydrotalcite structure. However, the divalent metal although in a more acid resistant form than the untreated hydrotalcite structure still comprises sufficient quantities of the divalent metal form for these to be potentially released under extreme acid conditions such as those typically encountered in an empty stomach.<br>
Seida et al (Water research 36 2002 1306-1312) discloses that phosphate binding by layered double hydroxides containing iron increases at a pH value maintained at pH 6.86 due to a combination of anion -exchange as well as precipitation or coagulation of the released divalent metal ion binding with phosphate. This compound was separated from the phosphate solution in order to determine the residual phosphate concentration in the solution. The isolated compound was not dried or milled and not intended for use as a new phosphate binder. Moreover the compound was already partially bound to phosphate thereby reducing remaining sites available for further phosphate binding. In addition, the teaching of Seida et al suggests that the presence of magnesium in the mixed metal compounds plays an important part in producing sufficient precipitation and increasing phosphate binding.<br>
J.Das et al teaches that layered double hydroxides increasingly dissolve at pH values below 6 with a further decrease in phosphate binding. Ookubo et al (Langmuir 1993, 9, 1418-1422) teaches that layered double hydroxides (referred to as hydrotalcites) are soluble in strong acidic media and should only be used as drugs when the hydrotalcite is protected by an enteric acid resistant coating. However, enteric coated drugs would be acid resistant as well as being resistant to phosphate binding. Furthermore, Ookubo and Shin et al, Wat. Sci. Tech. 1996, Vol 34, No1-2, page 161-168 teaches that the carbonate of hydrotalcite-type materials is not readily replaced by other anions and that chlorine comprising hydrotalcites should be used for binding phosphate.<br>
J.Das et al, Applied Clay Science 32 2006 252-260 discloses magnesium aluminium mixed metal layered hydroxide compounds with a divalent: trivalent metal range of 2:1 to<br>
4:1 wherein the phosphate binding decreases with increasing divalent: trivalent metal ratio. It is believed that the higher amount of the trivalent metal increases phosphate binding because it creates a higher net positive charge on the hydroxide layer compared to samples with less of the trivalent metal. However, the examples described in Das et al teach divalent:trivalent metal molar ratios not lower than 2:1. Moreover, Rives et al, Layered Double Hydroxides Present and Future, teaches that the preferred lower limit is 2:1 and not exceeding a ratio less than 1:1. Mg-depleted mixed metal compounds of divalent: trivalent ratios less than 2:1 were prepared in our laboratory either via modification of coprecipitation or precipitation methods described in WO-A-99/15189 by controlling the pH at a lower pH (i.e. pH value of 5) during the reaction-stage, which is in contrast to the teaching of WO-A-99/15189 describing an optimum pH range of 10-10.5. Alternatively, the mixed metal compounds of WO-A-99/15189 were treated after the precipitation reaction-stage (i.e. post-synthesis), with a depleting agent. Treatment of mixed metal compounds of WO-A-99/15189 containing carbonate anion with hydrochloric acid are preferred because they were found to result either in compounds with good phosphate binding but with lower release of the divalent cation and/or showed a decreased presence of a mixture of single metal compounds of M"(OH)2, M"(OH)3, un-reacted reagents or other non hydrotalcite crystalline phases. Furthermore, mixtures prepared by simply admixing two different single metal salts at equivalent ratio to the Mg-depleted compound were also found to have lower phosphate binding or more release of the divalent cation (Table 2).<br>
Phosphate binders based on single metal types such iron-oxide-hydroxide FeOOH are disclosed in US617444 and EP1932808 or LaCarbonate disclosed in US2008/0187602 but require the presence of carbohydrate stabilisers to prevent time ageing and transformation into iron-oxides or La hydroxycarbonates during manufacture and typically have a lower phosphate binding capacity.<br>
Thus there is an urgent and widespread need for a more effective phosphate binder which does not release trivalent or divalent ions into the blood stream, does not require enteric coating and which is effective over a wide pH range of from 2-8.<br>

Furthermore the present invention provides a process for preparation of depleted compounds comprising oxide-hydroxide of metal having a M-0 bond distance of approximately 2 © (angstrom) as determined by Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAF) studies. More specifically, for depleted compound derived from a Mg Fe mixed metal compound (example A), the distance between the centre absorbing iron atom and its nearest oxygen atom neighbour is 1.994 © (1st shell distance). The distance between the centre absorbing iron atom and its nearest iron neighbour (M-O-M distance) is 3.045 © (2nd shell distance). A preferred range M-0 bond distance is between 1.5 -2.5 © and a preferred range of M-O-M distance is between 2 - 4 ©,<br>
We have found surprisingly that under controlled conditions it is possible to remove the more soluble metal from the mixed metal compounds such as layered hydroxide structure or a heat-treated mixed metal compound whilst maintaining mixed metal compounds with divalent: trivalent molar ratios less than 1 with a typical hydrotalcite XRD signature, thereby creating metal-depleted mixed metal compounds with improved or maintained phosphate binding and a lower release of divalent or trivalent metal ions (such as magnesium) during the phosphate binding reaction. In addition or alternatively, the metal-depleted mixed metal compound may be heat-treated to increase phosphate-binding and reduce metal (e.g. magnesium) release further. The metal-depleted mixed metal compound has superior phosphate binding characteristics to the mixed metal compounds of WO-A-99/15189 and PCT/GB2006/000452. The metal-depleted mixed metal compound may be magnesium depleted. The magnesium-depleted mixed metal compound comprises a lower content of the more soluble divalent magnesium ion and more of the less soluble trivalent iron resulting in ratios of divalent Mg: trivalent Fe range significantly less than those previously reported for solid mixed metal compounds used for phosphate binding.<br>
We have found that by using the carbonate instead of sulphate anion in the starting material, acidification of the mixed metal compound results in a cleaner compound i.e. with lower amounts of sulphates salts remaining in the depleted product; this is because of the acidification of the carbonate anion only leads to formation of water and carbon dioxide.<br>
By mixed metal compound, it is meant that the atomic structure of the compound includes the cations of at least two different metals distributed uniformly throughout its structure. The term mixed metal compound does not include mixtures of crystals of two salts, where each crystal type only includes one metal cation. Mixed metal compounds are typically the result of coprecipitation from solution of different single metal compounds in contrast to a simple solid physical mixture of 2 different single metal salts. Mixed metal compounds as used herein include compounds of the same metal type but with the metal in two different valence states e.g. Fe(ll) and Fe(lll) as well as compounds containing more than 2 different metal types in one compound.<br>
The mixed metal compound may also comprise amorphous (non-crystalline) material. By the term amorphous is meant either crystalline phases which have crystallite sizes below the detection limits of x-ray diffraction techniques, or crystalline phases which have some degree of ordering, but which do not exhibit a crystalline diffraction pattern and/or true amorphous materials which exhibit short range order, but no long-range order.<br>
The substances of the invention may contain at least one compound of formula (I) or (IV). The process of preparing (such as) depleting the compound may also result in other materials being present in addition to compounds of formula (I) or (IV), for example single (as opposed to mixed) metal compounds may also be formed during the process.<br>
The process for preparing compounds of formula (I) or (IV) may result in changes in the structure of the compound which is the starting material. Therefore the formula (I) or (IV) describe only the elemental composition of compounds of formula (I) or (IV) and do not provide a definition of structure<br>
The compound of the present invention or for use in the present invention is preferably formed with no aging or hydrothermal treatment to avoid the crystals of the compound growing in size and to maintain a high surface area over which phosphate binding can take place. The compound of formula I is also preferably maintained in a fine particle size form during the post-synthesis route to maintain good phosphate binding. Preferably 90% of the compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 200 micron, more preferably 90% of the compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 100 micron, most preferably 90% of the compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 50 micron.<br>
The compound of the present invention may also be prepared in the form of granulates. When comprised in the granulate form it is preferred that 90% of the compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 1000 micron, more preferably 90% of the compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 750 micron, most preferably 90% of the compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 500 micron even more preferred 90% of the<br>
compound of formula I based on volume (d90) has a particle size of less than 250 micron.<br>
As used herein, the term "Layered Double Hydroxide" (LDH) is used to designate synthetic or natural lamellar hydroxides with two kinds of metallic cations in the main layers and interlayer domains containing anionic species. This wide family of compounds is sometimes also referred to as anionic clays, by comparison with the more usual cationic clays whose interlamellar domains contain cationic species. LDHs have also been reported as hydrotalcite-like compounds by reference to one of the polytypes of the corresponding [Mg-AI] based mineral. (See "Layered Double Hydroxides: Present and Future", ed, V Rives, 2001 pub. Nova Science).<br>
For ease of reference, these and further aspects of the present invention are now discussed under appropriate section headings. However, the teachings under each section are not necessarily limited to each particular section.<br>

The at least one bivalent metal (M") may be selected from any suitable metal. M is preferably selected from Mg (II), Zn (II), Fe (II), Cu (II), Ca (II), La (II), Ce (II) and Ni(ll). M" is further preferably selected from Mg (II), Zn(ll), Fe (II), Cu (II) and Ni(ll). Of these, Mg is especially preferred.<br>
The at least one trivalent metal (M'') may be selected from any suitable metal. M'" is preferably selected from Al (III), Mn(lll), Fe(lll), La(lll) and Ce(lll). M'" is preferably selected from Mn(lll), Fe(lll), La(lll) and Ce(lll). Of these, Fe(lll) is especially preferred, particularly in the case when M" is Mg M" and M1" may be different metals or they may be the same metal but in different valence states. For instance, M" may be Fe(ll) and M1" Fe(lll). However it is highly preferred that M" and M1" are different metals. M(lll) may also be Al(lll) for treatments where aluminium accumulation and toxic complications are not a problem. Preferably, any substance of the invention is substantially or totally free of aluminium.<br>
Fe(lll) is especially preferred as results demonstrate that this metal does not dissolve simultaneously with the Mg(ll) during the depletion process thereby enabling the formation of a Mg-depleted compound. In contrast, mixed metal compounds prepared from Mg Al were more difficult to deplete because of a more similar dissolution profile of the Mg and Al metal resulting in compounds of more equimolar ratios.<br>

As will be understood from the description of the invention provided herein, a may be any value between 1 and 0.4. Thus 1 &gt; a &gt; 0.4.<br>
Preferred aspects of the invention are provided wherein 1.&gt;a&gt;0.4.<br>
0.98 &gt; a &gt; 0.5. 0.98 &gt;a&gt; 0.6 0.98&gt;a&amp;0.7.<br>
0.95&gt;a&gt;0.7 0.90&gt;a&gt;0.7 0.85&gt;a&gt;0.7 0.80&gt;a&gt;0.7<br>
The increase of the value of "a" above 0.98 results in more significant reduction in phosphate binding of up to 75 %. Without being bound by theory it is believed that the decreased phosphate binding for values of "a" above 0.98 results from the complete removal of the divalent metal (magnesium); furthermore, the yield (the amount of phosphate binder isolated after the depletion-reaction) is reduced significantly because of loss of the iron. This makes the compound structurally unstable and thereby less effective as a phosphate binder. Whereas if the value of "a" is 0.98 &gt; a &gt; 0.7 phosphate binding may be reduced by only approx 10%. If the value of "a" is below 0.7 phosphate binding is either higher or maintained. If the "a" value is above 0.8 the potential for release of the divalent metal (magnesium) is still more than 50% of the total available amount of divalent metal present in un-depleted phosphate binder thereby providing the potential undesirable release of metal. Consequently a preferred range is between 0.80 &gt; a £ 0.7 as this provides the best compromise between good phosphate binding and lower amounts of divalent metal available for dissolution. Coincidently, this also falls within the pH region of 4-6 whereby the largest pH buffering is observed of the undepleted material and where a transformation from the presence of a crystalline (hydrotalcite) to a non-crystalline structure is observed (table 3). Typically the yield of the depletion reaction is not less than 50% if a s 0.7 (table 5).<br>
In addition, depleted compounds of "a" values above 0.95 are more difficult to consistently manufacture and phosphate binding is reduced and approaches that of a sample of FeOOH ("a" value is 1). As discussed hereinbefore, pure FeOOH compounds are less stable and require the presence of a stabilising agent e.g. carbohydrate.<br>
 <br>
For values of "a" obtainable from the compounds isolated from a solution maintained at pH values of 8, 9 or higher, phosphate binding occurs mainly only through ion-exchange of the phosphate anion in solution with the anion present in the solid layered double hydroxide or mixed metal compound. The maximum phosphate binding capacity of the layered double hydroxides structure or the mixed metal compounds with values of "a" below 0.4 are then limited by the amount of the exchangeable anion and its associated charge within the starting material, in addition, the available size of the space between the layers of the mixed metal compound is also restricting the exchange of phosphate at "a" values below 0.4. Values of "a" above 0.4 are known to those skilled in the art to lead to less stable layered double hydroxide structures and these compositions have therefore previously not been considered as effective binders of anions such as phosphate. Surprisingly we have found that despite the gradual loss of the typical layered double hydroxide or hydrotalcite structure, phosphate binding actually increases or is typically maintained at values of "a" above that of 0.4 and only decreases significantly when "a" is above 0.98. It is believed that the higher amount of the trivalent metal maintains good phosphate binding because of a higher net positive charge on the metal hydroxide layers compared to samples with less of the trivalent metal but without the restrictions in phosphate binding observed for those compounds of "a" values below 0.4. Moreover we found that single metal trivalent metal hydroxide such as ferric hydroxides or ferric citrate compounds are less effective phosphate binders showing that the presence of some divalent metal is preferred but not at levels resulting in ratios of mixed metal compounds of those of "a" values below 0.4. In addition, simple mixtures prepared from mixtures of magnesium and iron salts are not as effective (table 2).<br>
In effect because of exposure of the metal based phosphate binders to a depleting agent, prior to use as a medicament, release of solubilised metal is significantly reduced upon subsequent further contact with gastric acid in the stomach, whilst surprisingly maintaining good phosphate binding activity in the gut.<br>

and a mixed metal compound obtained by or obtainable by said process.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention the compound obtained by the treatment of a compound of formula (IV) wherein 0 
Suitably, the structures are depleted in metal using a depleting agent selected from HCI, H2S04, citric acid, EDTA, HN03, acetic acid and aluminium sulphate [AI2(S04)3] and combinations hereof. Preferably the acid or chelating agent is hydrochloric acid.<br>
The process of depletion may also be used for other existing phosphate binders. Preferably this would be for metal base binders but may also be used for non-metal based phosphate binders such as sevelamer type polymers.<br>
The concentration of the depleting agent may range from about 0.01 M to about 5M. Suitably, the structures are depleted (such as in magnesium) using depleting agent of<br>
 <br>
concentration 0.01 M to 5 M, preferably a concentration from 0.1 to 2 M, more preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 M.<br>
Preferably the process provides a reduction of the amount of metal M"0 by at least 10% by weight compared to that of the untreated compound of formula (IV).<br>
The treatment with hydrochloric acid (HCI) is suitably carried out with HCI of concentration 0.01 M to 5 M, preferably a concentration from 0.1 to 2 M, more preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 M.<br>
The compound of formula (IV) wherein 0 
The compound of formula (IV) wherein 0 
The optimum in treatment time may vary depending on the conditions of the treatment e.g. amount of starting material, acid concentration, type of acid, treatment pH etc The optimum treatment time will be shorter when using stronger acids whereas optimum treatment time will increase with weaker acid strengths.<br>
Preferably, the acid strength is not too weak (less than 0.1M), as this would increase production time as well as increasing the volume of acid required.<br>
The treatment as described above results in the reduction of the divalent metal ion from the compound according to formula (IV). The treatment is believed to lead to the formation of a compound according to the invention. This results in the value of a for a compound according to formula (IV) being equal to or larger than the value of a for the corresponding untreated compound according to formula (IV).<br>
The depletion treatment is preferably not excessive in terms of acid and/or chelating agent concentration and/or time of exposure, by which it is meant that the treatment<br>
should not exceed treatment for more than 2 hours, otherwise a phosphate binding performance which is less than optimal may be found.<br>
Treatment with acid below pH = 3 (i.e. contacting the compound for a sufficient time with acid until an equilibrium pH 3 is reached and then maintaining at the equilibrium value for sufficient time -typically a 30 minutes time period was used for the total of the initial addition and for maintaining the pH constant) results in the increase of the value of a to more than 0.98 and significant reduction in phosphate binding. Hence it is preferred that a is less than 0.99, more preferably less than 0.95, even more preferably less than 0.9, most preferably less than 0.85. Excessive treatment with acid may lead to complete dissolution of the compound with significant reduction in phosphate binding performance or yield of preparation, hence it is preferred that the substances of the invention are not completely dissolved.<br>
Treatment with acid at or below pH 5 results in complete loss of the hydrotalcite XRD signal. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the divalent metal-depleted compounds obtained at pH of 5 or less are the result of the transition from the crystalline hydrotalcite into a non-crystalline phase. The non-crystalline phase is structurally stable but when obtained at pH values of pH 3 or below will also start releasing the trivalent metal ions. Consequently, there is an optimum pH range to which the material is depleted. Depleted compounds obtained at pH 5 typically have a value for a of not more than 0.85 and so it is preferred if the compound of formula (I) has a value for a of 0.85 or less, preferably 0.8 or less, but not less than 0.4, preferably not less than 0.5, most preferably not less than 0 6, most preferably not less than 0.7. A value of a of not less than 0.7 is preferred because the depleted compound of an a value of 0.7 has approximately a 50% reduction of the release of the divalent metal into solution during the phosphate binding. Assuming equivalent phosphate binding capacity, an equivalent average daily dose of magnesium-depleted Mg Fe mixed metal compound (i.e. 3 to 4.5 g of example A) containing 50% less magnesium would be expected to increase serum magnesium by between 0.12 and 0.18 mmol/l whereas an increase of 0.24 and 0.36 mmol/l would be expected for use of the equivalent compound with no depletion when taken by kidney patients. In contrast, subjects with normal functioning kidneys would not see an increase in serum magnesium when taking either the depleted compound or the<br>
un-depleted compound from an average baseline of 0.95 mmol/l. A controlled use of a small (i.e. leading to an increase serum magnesium of less than 0.12 mmol/l) but not excessive (i.e. leading to an increase of serum magnesium of more than 0.24 mmol/l) amount of magnesium supplementation may be of benefit to healthy subjects or kidney patients.<br>
Preferably, treatment of the compound of formula (IV) results in a substance with at least a 5% higher phosphate binding capacity when measured according to the standard phosphate binding method (Test Method 1a) or not more than 25% reduction in phosphate binding capacity when measured according to the representative test method (Test Method 1b or method 1c or 1d) relative to that of the compound of formula (IV) from which the substance is obtained or obtainable by treatment with acid or chelating agent.<br>
A suitable method for monitoring the degree of acid addition is by continuous measurement of the pH with a pH meter (Jenway 3520) using a combined glass electrode (VWR 6621759). The pH meter was calibrated with buffers of pH 4, 7 and 10 before any measurement. The pH of the solution was adjusted using minimum volume of the acid and/or chelating agent solution at room temperatures 20 +/- 5 °Celsius. The total volume added for pH adjustment never exceeded 60% of the total volume.<br>
A suitable method for monitoring the divalent metal depletion of the compound is by measurement of the metal oxide content, i.e. where the compound is magnesium depleted by measuring the MgO content. This is measured by XRF (PW2400 Wavelength Dispersive XRF Spectrometer).<br>
Another suitable method for monitoring the divalent metal depletion of the compound is by measurement of the magnesium released from the compound during the phosphate binding.<br>
Suitably, the magnesium-depleted mixed metal compound after treatment has less than 28%, preferably less than 25%, more preferably less than 20% but does not have less than 0.5% by weight MgO content.<br>
Preparation<br>
Phosphate is also believed to bind to the depleted compound through a direct ionic interaction between one or two negatively charged oxygen ions on the phosphate with the M(lll) metal centre in the solid through displacement of hydroxide.<br>
It was discovered that the biggest increase in phosphate binding and/or reduction in magnesium release was found for those compounds isolated from solution where the pH was within the pH buffering region of the starting material from which the M(ll) depleted material was derived. For example, the mixed metal compound A (table 3), has pH buffering properties between pH 3 and 8 and most significantly between 5 and 7. The Mg-depleted compounds isolated from compound "A" all showed higher phosphate binding (phosphate binding test method 1A) when isolated at pH between 3 and 8 than for those isolated at pH values of 3, 8 or 9. Depleted compounds isolated at very low pH (pH 3 or less) resulted in lower phosphate binding, lower yield and also more significant dissolution of the trivalent cation whereas depleted compounds isolated at high pH values 8 or 9 were not sufficiently depleted to improve phosphate binding above that of the starting material or showed more release of the divalent metal.<br>
The increase in phosphate removal by the M(ll) depleted compound correlates with the increase in pH buffering capacity when measured with the standard test method 1a of the mixed metal compound from which the M(ll) depleted completed compound was derived. Consequently, the presence of hydroxide (OH) groups in the M(ll)-depleted compound is preferred for binding phosphate such as of formula: M"-i_aMNla (OH)d , [M'V aM'"a (OH)d ](An" )c or formula (I) (III) or (IV) wherein 1 &gt; a &gt; 0.4 and 0 
Since phosphate binding will also take place at the surface of the M(ll) depleted solid, the amount of surface area is one important attribute in determining how much phosphate the M(ll) depleted compound can bind. Preferably, a surface area of more than 10 m2/g, preferably more than 50 m2/g even more preferably more than 100 m2/g, most preferably more than 250 m2/g.<br>
Compounds of the invention or for use in the invention are preferably made by acid treatment with hydrochloric acid of a suitable starting material as hereinbefore described. Optionally other chemicals may be employed to prepare the substance of invention such as using other acids and chelating agents. Optionally other preparation-routes may be used such as treatment of slurries, moist filtration cakes containing the compound, wet-cakes, milled, un-milled forms of the dried compound or even by controlling the pH during the reaction-stage. Preferably, at a pH less than 10 but not less than pH = 3; between this range pH 5 is preferred. Optionally, the recipe for the co-precipitation route may be changed by using a smaller amount of the divalent salt (i.e. MgS04). Optionally other conditions may be used for example high or low temperature or pressure conditions.<br>
The substances of the invention prepared by treatment of a suitable starting material as hereinbefore described may be prepared by providing a first solution of a water soluble compound of metal M" and a water soluble compound of metal M'", the anions being chosen so as not to result in precipitation from the first solution. A second solution is also provided, of a water soluble hydroxide (e.g. NaOH) and a water soluble salt of anion An" (the cation being chosen so as not to precipitate with the hydroxide or the anion with the metal from the hydroxide). The two solutions are then admixed and the mixed metal compound starting material is formed by co-precipitation. It comprises solid crystalline material, usually also with the presence of some solid amorphous material. Preferably, at least some of the material so formed is of a layered double hydroxide and/or of a hydrotalcite structure, usually also with some amorphous and/or poorly crystalline material, preferably after co-precipitation, the material is then filtered or centrifuged, washed then dried by heating.<br>
The starting material may be prepared by heat treatment (calcination) of the starting material. Alternatively, the depleted material may be heat-treated (calcination) preferably at temperatures equal to or less than 500 °C to improve phosphate binding. Calcination temperatures of equal to or less than 500 °C are preferred to avoid formation of spinel type compounds and optimise phosphate binding.<br>
It is preferred that the material is washed in order to remove the water-soluble salts that are the by product of the treatment. If significant amounts of these soluble salts are left admixed with the isolated solid, then the subsequent solid may potentially have an adverse effect on its phosphate binding behaviour. The material is preferably washed such that the remaining level of water soluble salts (having a solubility in water of 1g/litre or more) is less than 15%, preferably less than 10%, more preferably less than 5% by weight of the solid mixed metal compound after drying as described below. Especially because of the depletion process (for example with acid treatment with HCI) water-soluble salts of divalent metals (i.e. MgCI2) are formed which are the by product of the depletion treatment. We have found that a larger number of repeat wash cycles is required to remove the water-soluble salts.<br>
After isolation of the depleted compound (with any means of isolation such as filtration, centrifugation or decantation) and washing, the drying is preferably carried out at low temperature (such as to provide a product or oven temperature of up to 120°C), for example by oven drying, spray drying or fluid bed drying.<br>
Optionally, the dry material may be classified prior to acid-treatment, to remove oversize particles by milling and/or sieving and/or any other suitable technique, for example to restrict the material to be treated to particles which are substantially no greater than 100um in diameter. Preferably, as measured by sieving, less than 10% by weight of particles are greater than 106um in diameter, more preferably less than 5%. Most preferably, no particles are greater than 106um in diameter as measured by sieving.<br>
The dry material is typically directly subjected to the necessary treatment, preferably with HCI of concentration 0.01 M to 5 M, preferably a concentration from 0.1 to 2 M, more preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 M for a period of 5 minutes or longer, more preferably 15 minutes or longer, more preferably 1 hour or longer. The compound is preferably treated for 1 hour or less, more preferably 30 minutes or less, even more preferably 15 minutes or less.<br>
Optionally, the moist filter cake or slurry material may be directly subjected to the treatment.<br>
A preferred process in accordance with the present invention is recited below: Taking (20 g of) compound comprising a compound of formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where the value of a is suitably from 0.2 to 0.4; or formula (III):<br>

where 0 
and slurrying in water (500 ml), maintaining the material at a constant maintained pH value selected from the range between 3 to 9, preferably between 4 to 8, most preferably between 5 to 7 for 60 mins, preferably 30 mins, more preferably 15 mins or less with an acid and /or chelating agent, preferably HCI of concentration 0.01 M to 5 M, more preferably a concentration from 0.1 to 2 M, more preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 M, most preferably with 1M HCI.<br>
The slurry is then filtered and washed with (200 ml) of water. Preferably 200 ml or more, more preferably 600 ml or more, most preferred 3000 ml or more. After the filtering or centrifuging and washing, the drying is preferably carried out at low temperature (such as providing a product temperature of up to 120°C), for example by oven drying, spray drying or fluid bed drying. Oversize particles are then size reduced by milling and/or removed by sieving and/or any other suitable technique, for example to restrict the material to particles which are substantially no greater than 100um in diameter. Preferably, as measured by sieving, less than 10% by weight of particles are greater than 106um in diameter, more preferably less than 5%. Most preferably, no particles are greater than 106um in diameter as measured by sieving.<br>
Preferably, the treatment results in a reduction in the amount of loss into solution of metal M" from the acid-treated compound by at least 5% by weight compared to loss from the untreated compound, when measuring the loss of metal M" using the test as hereinafter described.<br>
The substances of the invention may contain at least one compound of formula (I) or formula (IV) but the process mentioned above for making the starting material may also cause other materials to be present in the intermediate product e.g. of formula (II) and/or<br>
(III) in the final product, for example single (as opposed to mixed) metal compounds which may also be formed during the co-precipitation or depletion process.<br>
Determination of Phosphate Binding Capacity<br>
In vitro Phosphate binding test in simple phosphate solutions<br>
A specific method for determining phosphate binding capacity is given in more detail herein. This was the method actually used in the Examples. However, as a generality, elsewhere in this specification, unless specifically indicated to the contrary, any reference to percentage phosphate binding capacity is preferably that determined by the following method. 0.4 gram of the substance of the invention is added to 10ml, 40 mmol I"1 sodium phosphate solution adjusted to a pH of choice. Preferably, any quoted percentage phosphate binding capacity herein is maintained for measurements at pH values over the range of from 3 to 7, more preferably from 2 to 8. Samples are homogenised and gently agitated at room temperature (20 °C) for 30 minutes. Following centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm, the supernatant is filtered through 0.22 urn millipore filters. Soluble phosphate is measured in the supernatant. The percentage phosphate bound by the phosphate binder is then calculated relative to the untreated phosphate starting solution.<br>
Phosphate binding tests in a model of the human gastro intestinal tract. In vitro phosphate binding tests are widely established in the literature for the evaluation of efficacy of phosphate binders in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia. The principle of phosphate binding test is well accepted as transferable to in vivo situations. To further exemplify this we also determined the phosphate binding activity in a sophisticated gastro-intestinal model named tiny-TIM in the presence of a test meal.<br>
Phosphate binding of the Mg depleted product of 500 mg of example A, 2 and 5 were placed in capsules (gelatine capsule) and dosed into tiny-TIM which is a model of the human gastro intestinal tract (by TNO, Zeist, The Netherlands). Details of this model have been widely published; for example as in US 5525305. These experiments were performed under the average physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract representative for humans. These conditions include the dynamics of gastric emptying and intestinal transit times, the gastric and intestinal pH values, and the composition and<br>
activity of the secretion products. The phosphate binding capacity was determined from a reduction of bio-accessible phosphorus (fraction available for intestinal absorption).<br>
Phosphate" refers to the total phosphate in solution. Depending on the pH of the solution, this "phosphate" can be in the form of P043", H P042', H2 P04" or H3 P04<br>

(b) Preparation of compounds of formula (I) or (IV)<br>
Actual preparation of depleted compound according to M1 (of Table 1) was as follows.<br>
After taking 20 g of starting material (either one of compound Example A to E) and slurrying in 500 ml water, pH was immediately measured and the pH maintained constant at pH 3 for 30 minutes by addition of 1 M HCI (the depleting agent). The slurry obtained was then filtered and washed with 200 ml water and then dried in an oven (at 120 °C for 3 hrs). Oversize particles were then removed by milling and sieving to a particle size of no greater than 106 urn in diameter by sieving. The depletion method of M1 was then varied in that they were conducted using different depleting agents, at different strengths, for different treatment periods, and at different preparation pH.<br>
The depleting agents were selected from HCI, H2S04, citric acid, EDTA, HN03, acetic acid; the molarity of HCI was also selected from 1M and 5M. The reaction media was selected from water or aqueous phosphate solution. The contact time during acid addition was selected from 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 60 minutes. The preparation pH was selected from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.<br>
The methods are shown below in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 - Methods of Depletion(Table Removed)<br>
For a depletion pH less than 6, 90% of the depletion agent was added in the first 10 minutes, the remainder over 20 minutes, for a depletion pH greater than 6, 75% of the depletion agent was added in the first 5 minutes and the remainder over 25 minutes. Addition of fixed amount of depletion agent at time 0 to attain desired pH<br>
Addition rate 10ml/min for first 40 minutes then 5ml/min for additional 20mins then 2.5ml/min for remaining 10 minutes, total addition time 70mins<br>
The acid-treated materials thus obtained from the various methods were then tested for phosphate binding capacity, soluble magnesium, surface absorbed water content and also subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis. The methods employed are described below.<br>
The labelling of each method, e.g. M1, is used in the tests below to identify the particular method of depletion used for each sample.<br>
Method for preparation of tablet formulation of depleted compound<br>
A dry blend comprising 80.00%w/w of the depleted compound of example 2 (Table 2), 15.00%w/w pre-gelled starch and 5.00%w/w micronized crospovidone was made in a mixer/blender, then purified water added until granulation of the blend was achieved. Any further batches of granule required from the same API were made and combined before drying The granule was then dried in a fluid bed drier to a target moisture of 5-7%w/w then milled in a high speed blade mill until it passed through a 425 micron aperture sieve. The sieved granule was then mixed with 0 25%w/w of sieved magnesium stearate to produce the material for tabletting.<br>
Tablets were made where possible on a Manesty F3 single station press using a double convex oblong punch and die set Target hardness for the tablets was 10-15 Kg as measured on a Holland C50 tablet hardness tester.<br>
Coating of the tablets was achieved using a hand held spray gun with the tablet cores in a rotating basket with the hot air for drying the tablets supplied by a hot air gun. The coating suspension comprised. 84.03%w/w water. 0.81 %w/w sodium dodecyl sulphate, 8.075%w/w Eudragit EPO, 1.21%w/w stearic acid, 2.09%w/w talc, 2.8285w/w magnesium stearate, 0.643%w/w titanium dioxide and 0.323%w/w iron oxide. The weights of coating achieved ranged from 4.0 to 6 66%w/w based on the uncoated tablet weight. The disintegration times of the coated tablets were not determined. Phosphate binding and magnesium release (standard method) was respectively 0.54 mmol/g and 0.157 mmol/g for the tablet containing the depleted compound of example 2 whereas the tablet containing the un-depleted compound showed respectively phosphate binding and magnesium release of 0.63 mmol/g and 0.16 mmol/g.<br>
Test Method 1:<br>
(a) Determination of Phosphate Binding Capacity and Soluble Magnesium/ Iron using standard method<br>
40mM Sodium Phosphate solution (pH 4) was prepared and treated with the phosphate-binder. The supernatant of the centrifuged phosphate-solution and binder mixture was then diluted and analysed by ICP-OES for Fe, Mg and P content. The latter analysis technique is well known to those skilled in the art. ICP-OES is the acronym for inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy.<br>
Reagents used for this method were: Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate Monohydrate (Aldrich), 1M hydrochloric acid, AnalaR™ water, standard phosphorous solution (10.000ug/ml, Romil Ltd), standard magnesium solution (10,000|jg/ml, Romil Ltd), standard iron solution (LOOOug/ml), sodium chloride (BDH).<br>
Specific apparatus used were centrifuge (Metier 2000E), blood-tube rotator (Stuart Scientific), minishaker (MS1), ICP-OES, blood collection tubes. Phosphate buffer (pH = 4) was prepared by weighing 5.520 g (+/-0.001 g) of sodium di-hydrogen phosphate followed by addition of AnalaR™ water and transferring to a 1ltr volumetric flask.<br>
To the 1 Itr volumetric flask was then added 1 M HCI drop-wise to adjust the pH to pH 4 (+/-0.1) mixing between additions. The volume was then accurately made up to 1ltr using AnalaR™ water and mixed thoroughly.<br>
0.4g (+/- 0.005g) of each sample was weighed into the supplied blood collection tubes and placed in the holding rack. All samples were prepared in duplicate and temperature of solutions maintained at 20°C. 10ml aliquots of the phosphate buffer were pipetted into each of the blood collection tubes containing the pre-weighed test materials and the screw cap fitted. The vessels were agitated over a minishaker for about ten seconds. The vessels were transferred onto a blood tube rotator and mixed for 30 minutes (+/- 2 minutes). The vessels were then centrifuged at 3000rpm and 20°C for 5 minutes. The<br>
samples were removed from the centrifuge and 2.5ml aliquots were pipetted of the supernatant and transferred into a fresh blood collection tubes. 7.5 ml of AnalaR™ water were pipetted to each 2.5ml aliquot and the screw cap fitted and mixed thoroughly. The solutions were then analysed on a calibrated ICP-OES.<br>
The phosphate binding capacity was determined by:<br>
Phosphate binding (mmol/g) =	[SP (mmol/l)- TP (mmol/l)] / W (g/l)<br>
where:<br>
TP = Analyte value for phosphate in the phosphate solution after reaction with phosphate binder = solution P (mg/l) * 4 / 30.97. Tp used in test method 1a and Tp1 used instead of Tp for test method 1b, 1c and 1d<br>
SP = Analyte value for phosphate in the phosphate solution before reaction with phosphate binder.<br>
W = concentration binder (g/l) used in test method (i.e. 0.4 g /10 ml in test method 1a = 40 g/l)<br>
Magnesium release was determined by:<br>
Magnesium release (mmol/g) = [TMg (mmol/l) - SMg (mmol/l)]/W (g/l) where:<br>
TMg = Analyte value for magnesium in the phosphate solution after reaction with phosphate binder = solution Mg (mg/l) * 4 / 24.31. TMg used in test method 1a and TMg1 used instead of TMg for test method 1b, 1c and 1d<br>
SMg = Analyte value for magnesium in the phosphate solution before reaction with phosphate binder.<br>
Iron release was determined by:<br>
Iron release (mmol/g) = [TFe (mmol/l) - SFe (mmol/l)] / W (g/l) where:<br>
TFe = Analyte value for iron in the phosphate solution after reaction with phosphate binder = solution Fe (mg/l) * 4 / 55.85. TFe used in test method 1a and TFe1 used instead of TFe for test method 1b, 1c and 1 d<br>
SFe = Analyte value for iron in the phosphate solution before reaction with phosphate binder.<br>
The results for phosphate binding capacity, magnesium release and iron release measured by the standard method can be seen in Table 2 , 3 and 4<br>
(b) Determination of Phosphate Binding Capacity and Soluble Magnesium/ Iron using representative method at 0.4 g phosphate binder/10 ml.<br>
The standard phosphate binding test Test Method 1 (a) involves the use of phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 4. The pH of this test was found to increase from pH 4 to approx 8.5 -9 after addition of the mixed metal compounds of Examples A to F. We therefore also determined the phosphate binding capacity using a more representative method of conditions under gastric conditions (lower pH value of 3) and by maintaining the pH at a constant value by the addition of 1M HCI during the phosphate binding contrary to the standard phosphate binding test where the pH was allowed to rise during the phosphate binding.<br>
The representative method (for measuring phosphate binding and magnesium- or iron-release) was maintained as per standard phosphate binding test Test Method 1 (a), i.e. 0.4 g of the phosphate binder was dispersed in 10 ml phosphate buffer. The temperature of solutions was 20 °C. In order to monitor the pH, the sample was weighed into a Sterlin Jar. This jar is placed on a stirrer plate with stirrer placed in jar. The 10 ml of the phosphate buffer is added to the sample and the pH hereafter immediately monitored via a pH probe during 30 minutes and the pH was maintained at pH = 3 using 1M HCI delivered via a Dosimat titrator. The total volume of acid added for pH adjustment never exceeded 61% of the total volume. The volume of acid used for pH adjustment in the representative method is listed below for Example 1-5 (depleted) and Example A (= starting material i.e. not depleted). For other compounds the volume of acid required to maintain the pH constant was also recorded during the phosphate binding test and used for the formula described hereinafter whereby the analyte concentration is corrected for the dilution resulting from the acid addition.<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
t is obvious from this data that more pH adjustment was required for these samples which had been depleted at higher pH.<br>
The phosphate binding and Mg- and Fe- release data of the representative method was<br>
then corrected for the dilution of phosphate or compound concentration due to acid<br>
addition  (as  phosphate  binding  and  Mg- and  Fe-release  are measured from the<br>
difference between before and after the phosphate binding reaction) using the following<br>
formula:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Wherein Tp = analyte concentration for phosphate after reaction with phosphate binder Tp1 = identical as Tp but with concentration corrected for dilution because of acid addition TMg = analyte concentration for magnesium after reaction with phosphate binder TMg1 = identical as TMg but with concentration corrected for dilution because of acid<br>
addition TFe = analyte concentration for iron after reaction with phosphate binder TFe1 = identical as TFe but with concentration corrected for dilution because of acid<br>
addition<br>
After the 30 minutes phosphate binding, the slurry is transferred to a blood sample tube (approx 10 ml) and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 RPM. Then as per standard phosphate binding Test Method 1 (a) 2.5 ml of the supernatant is diluted to 10 ml with AnalaR water in a separate collection tube, ready for analysis on the ICP.<br>
The results for phosphate binding capacity, magnesium release and iron release measured with the representative method can be seen in Table 2 and 3.<br>
c) Determination of Phosphate Binding Capacity and Soluble Magnesium/ Iron using representative method at 0.2 g phosphate binder/10 ml.<br>
Identical method to that described in method 1b but with 0.2 g phosphate binder/10 ml<br>
Test Method 2:	X-Rav Diffraction (XRD) measurements<br>
Data was collected for fine particulate samples from 2-70° 29 on a Philips automatic powder X-ray diffractometer using Copper K alpha radiation generated at 40kV and 55mA.<br>
The results of the XRD measurements are seen in Table 3 and 5.<br>
Test Method 3:	Carbon content Analysis by the Leco Method<br>
This method was used to determine the levels of carbon content (indicative of the presence of the carbonate anion present in the mixed metal compound) A sample of known mass is combusted at around 1350 °C in a furnace in a pure oxygen atmosphere. Any carbon in the sample is converted to C02 which is passed through a moisture trap before being measured by an infra-red detector. By comparing against a standard of known concentration, the carbon content of the sample can be found. A Leco SC-144DR carbon and Sulphur Analyser, with oxygen supply, ceramic combustion boats, boat lance and tongs was used. 0.2 g (+/-0.01 g) of sample was weighed into a combustion boat. The boat was then placed into the Leco furnace and the carbon content analysed. The analysis was performed in duplicate.<br>
The % C was determined by:<br>
%C (sample)  =	(%C, + %C2)/2<br>
Where Ci and C2 are individual carbon results.<br>
The results of the carbon content measurements are seen in Table 5 and were expressed as %C02 = %C x 44/12<br>
Test Method 4:	XRF Analysis<br>
XRF analysis of the product was performed by using a Philips PW2400 Wavelength Dispersive XRF Spectrometer. The sample was fused with 50:50 lithium tetra/metaborate (high purity) and presented to the instrument as a glass bead. All reagents used were analytical grade or equivalent unless specified. AnalaR™ water, Lithium tetraborate 50% metaborate 50% flux (high purity grade ICPH Fluore-X 50). A muffle furnace capable of 1025 °C, extended tongs, hand tongs, Pt/5%Au casting tray and Pt/5%/Au dish were used. 1.5 g (+/- 0.0002 g) of sample and 7.5000 g (+/- 0.0002 g) of tetra/metaborate was accurately weighed out into a Pt/5%/Au dish. The two constituents were lightly mixed in the dish using a spatula, prior to placement in the furnace preset to 1025 °C for 12 minutes. The dish was agitated at 6 minutes and 9 minutes to ensure homogeneity of the sample. Also at 9 minutes the casting tray was placed in the furnace to allow for temperature equilibration. After 12 minutes the molten sample was poured into the casting tray, which was removed from the furnace and allowed to cool. The bead composition was determined using the spectrophotometer.<br>
The results of the XRF measurements are seen in Table 5.<br>
Test Method 5:	Determination of a, b.c. d and z values<br>
Value d of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 is an indicator for the relative amount of hydroxy (OH) groups and was determined from the titration of the un-depleted compound with HCI acid (i.e. by measuring the amount of acid required to change the pH from the initial pH (approx 9 for the Mg Fe mixed metal compound A; of before depletion) to the final pH (pH after depletion and pH at which the depleted compound was isolated). The value for d was found to correlate with the pH buffering properties of the compound. For example, the max value for d of 2 can be found for the un-depleted compound of the following       composition:       [Mg0 67Fe0 33(OH)2][(C03)o i?(S04)o 01.0.43H2O][Na2SO4]0 os-<br>
Titrating this compound with acid will result in release of magnesium and hydroxy ions; the released hydroxy ions in turn result in pH buffering.<br>
The following formula was used to calculate d<br>
d = 2 x [((volume of acid required to deplete material to pH 3) - (volume of acid )) / (volume of acid required to deplete material to pH 3)<br>
The results shown below are an example of the variation of d as a function of pH after depletion of example A,<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
the value of b was determined by the need for charge neutrality as expressed by the formula 2 + a - 2b - d - en = 0; the value for a was determined from the ratio between the divalent and trivalent metal content according to formula<br>
a =      	number of moles of M"'	<br>
(number of moles of M"+ number of moles of M1");<br>
The number of moles of M'"and M" was determined by the XRF method.<br>
The value for c (anion) was determined from the Leco (C02) and XRF (S03) method: = (( %CO? / molecular weight of CO?) + ( %SO^ / molecular weight of SO*)) (2 X ( %Fe203 / mo)ecu\ar weight of Fe203))<br>
z was calculated by<br>
= ((a =M"'/MIII+M") X (% H?0 / molecular weight of H?Q)) ( 2 X ( %Fe203 / molecular weight of Fe203))<br>
%H20 was determined from % w/w H20 = 100 - ( % w/w MM0 + % w/w M'^Os + % w/w C02 + % w/w Na20 + % w/w S03)<br>
Test Method 6 EXAF Studies<br>
Data were collected at the Fe K-edge at ambient temperature in transmission (standards) mode on station 9.3 of the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source, operating at 2 GeV with an average current of 180 mA. A Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used, detuned to reject 50% of the incident signal in order to minimise harmonic contamination. The monochromator angle was calibrated by running an edge scan for the Fe foil standard, lo and It were measured using ion chambers filled with a mixture of Ar/He. One scan was recorded for each of the transmission standards and sample.<br>
The data were initially processed using the Daresbury program EXCALIB, to convert the monochromator angles to the corresponding X-ray energy; for transmission spectra the signal was calculated as ln(lo/lt). The spectra collected for each sample were compared and summed.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The phosphate binding capacity, Mg release and Fe release for the different methods of depletion can be seen in Figure 2.<br>
The magnesium release of a given compound and its phosphate binding capacity will vary according to a number of parameters.<br>
The effect of the constant "a" (wherein "a" is variable a of the general formulae recited herein) on phosphate binding and magnesium release is shown in Table 3.<br>
Table 3 - Effect of formula constant "a" on phosphate binding and magnesium release(Table Removed)<br>
These results are also represented graphically in Figure 1 and 2. Thus, it can be seen that increasing the value for the constant "a" up to value 0.98, results in reduced magnesium loss and good phosphate binding.<br>
The effect of treatment time and preparation pH with 1M HCL on compounds of formula (II) is shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4 - Effect of treatment time and preparation pH with 1M HCI on compounds of formula (II) (Table Removed)<br>
ield for Depleted Product (%) = (weight of depleted product (g) / weight of initial material (g)) X 100<br>
As can be seen from the results in Table 4, there is an optimal time period of treatment whereby the magnesium can be removed from the compound whilst maintaining the iron within the structure. A treatment time of 30 minutes, using a preparation pH of 4 results<br>
 <br>
in an MgO content of 3.98 % and a 0.93 mmol/g bound phosphate. The yield for this sample was 43 %.<br>
A period of treatment which is less than 15 minutes will result in less magnesium being depleted from the compound than is desirable, resulting in small improvements in phosphate binding.<br>
Moreover, prolonged periods of treatment of 60 minutes or ionger results in the Mg-depleted compound itself being degraded resulting in a loss of yield in addition to a loss in phosphate binding.<br>
Further, extremes of low pH and long periods of treatment tend to result in removal of the iron from the compound structure.<br>
Thus, the data in Table 4 shows that the optimum treatment time within the pH range of 4 to 8 is 30 minutes. The optimum treatment time at pH 3 is 15 minutes.<br>
2<br>
However, it will be clear to the person skilled in the art that the optimum treatment time will vary depending on the conditions of treatment used e.g. variations in amount of starting material, acid type, concentration, treatment pH etc.<br>
Table 5 - Compositions and structure as measured by XRF and XRD<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It can be seen from the results of Table 5 that methods of depletion utilising a low preparation pH (3 - 5) tend to produce compounds having a non-crystalline structure. Methods of depletion utilising a preparation pH of above 5 tend to produce compounds having a hydrotalcite structure. The results of Table 5 are also represented graphically in Figure 5.<br>
Table 6	Effect of washing(Table Removed)<br>
The effect of increasing the volume of wash water on the composition of the depleted material is most evident at a lower preparation pH. The MgO content indicates that the product contains a significant percentage of magnesium salts, produced during depletion. The 3L wash produces a significantly more pure depleted product. The representative method indicates that phosphate binding capacity increases with higher volumes of wash water. The effect of increased washing is especially demonstrated by the results obtained via the standard method.<br>
(I)	Table 7	Effect of acid addition method(Table Removed)<br>
(II)	Total Acid Addition 825ml 1M HCI at 0 minutes<br>
(III)	Slow Acid Addition, rate 10ml/min for first 40 minutes then 5ml/min for additional 20mins then 2.5ml/min for remaining 10 minutes, total addition time 70mins<br>
The data indicates the slow acid addition affects the constitution of the depleted material. The iron oxide content increases by approximately 25% w/w. This also shows that the total acid addition method produces impurity products due to extremely low pH conditions achieved by the sudden addition of a large amount of acid. As a result the phosphate binding capacity is reduced and magnesium release increases in the Representative Method<br>
Table 8	Effect of drying method<br>
(Table Removed)The data indicates that the optimum drying temperature is 40°C for 3hrs, these conditions produce to best phosphate binding and magnesium release. High drying temperatures for the same time period produce compounds with higher MgO content when compared to the same material dried at lower temperature.<br>
Table 9	Determination of the phosphate binding capacity at different concentration(Table Removed)<br>
The desired 'a' value range for the Standard Method (0.60-0.99), Representative Method 0.4g (0.70-0.99), Representative Method 0.2g (0.80-0.99). The Standard Pi Binding Method gives lower Magnesium release values because the pH of the solution is not<br>
maintained and therefore rises from the initial pH of 4 to approximately pH 9 depending on the depletion conditions used. At high pH conditions the Mg Release is reduced.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* Values are the mean of 4 experiments, NS = not significant<br>
An overall increase in phosphate binding was observed using this more appropriate gastric test model. From this table it can be concluded that a higher degree of variation in phosphate binding and magnesium release exists in the Gl tract model than by the standard or representative method 1a or 1b. Depletion at low pH (providing a = 0.98 compound), magnesium release was significantly less and phosphate binding capacity was maintained, while depletion at higher pH (providing a = 0.39 compound) a similar phosphate binding capacity was evident but with a greater magnesium release. Other variations were not tested but this provides proof of principle that depletion of Mg results in low release of magnesium while maintaining phosphate binding capacity. Using a Bonferroni multiple comparison test (columns 5 and 6) there was no statistical difference in phosphate binding capacity between examples A ,2 or 5 (p
Figure 1 shows "a" as function of phosphate bound measured by 2 binding methods.<br>
The standard method (Test Method 1 a) is a standard phosphate binding method<br>
The representative method (Test Method 1b) is a method chosen to more closely mimic<br>
the conditions of the stomach<br>
Both methods showed increased or maintained phosphate binding as function of "a" up to 0.95.<br>
Both methods show decreased phosphate binding between "a" =0.95 and 1.0 which can be explained by dissolution of the compound upon exposure to extreme low acidic pH and time.<br>
Figure 2 shows "a" as function of magnesium released (from the phosphate binder). It is preferred to have less release of magnesium.<br>
The standard method   (Test Method 1a) is a standard magnesium release analysis<br>
method (measured at the same time and equipment/method as with standard phosphate<br>
binding)<br>
The representative method (Test Method 1b) is a method chosen to more closely mimic<br>
the conditions of the stomach<br>
The standard method shows a relatively constant level of magnesium release because in this test method the pH is allowed to rise from pH 4 to 9 at which magnesium release is less significant.<br>
The representative method shows Mg release decreasing as "a" increases. With this test method pH is maintained constant (at pH 3) resulting in more acid attack on the structure. Consequently, with this test there is a higher propensity to release magnesium ,when un-depleted, than in the standard test method.<br>
Conclusion from Figure 1 and 2 combined<br>
When combining the data of figure 1 and 2 it was surprising to find that the removal of magnesium from the mixed metal compound resulted in a new magnesium-depleted mixed metal compound indicated by increase of value for "a" above 0.35 which did not show a reduction of the binding of phosphate whilst simultaneously decreasing the<br>
potential for release of magnesium during the phosphate-binding process, in particular under more gastric (stomach) conditions of the representative method 1b.<br>
The untreated material typically has value of "a" = 0.35.<br>
