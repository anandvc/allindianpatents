				<td>FIELD OF USE<br>
The present invention relates to a star branched silicone polymer being a hydrosilylation reaction product. The invention also relates to coating flexible materials or supports such as sheets of paper or other polymeric material, either woven or non-woven, with a silicone composition. The present invention also relates to the coating of flexible materials or supports with liquid compositions comprising one or more cross-linkable polyorganosiloxanes wherein such polyorganosiloxanes are cross-linkable by an addition reaction, a condensation reaction, a cationic reaction, or a free-radical reaction. The present invention also relates to star branched polyorganosiloxanes (silicone polymers) that reduce misting during the application of the silicone composition (polyorganosiloxane) to the flexible material or support. The flexible support may be paper, cardboard, plastic film, metal film and the like. Some exemplary applications are paper for foodstuffs, adhesive labels, adhesive tapes, seals and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The coating of flexible supports with liquid silicones is typically carried out on coating devices that operate continuously at very high speed. These devices usually comprise coating heads composed of several rolls, including in particular a pressure roll and a coating roll that are continuously fed with a silicone composition that may or may not be cross-linkable, by means of a series of rolls that are placed next to one another. A strip of flexible support of the desired material to be coated is fed at high speed between the pressure roll and the coating roll to be coated on at least one of its surfaces. When it is intended to cross link the silicone coating, apparatus to implement a cross linking reaction are positioned downstream of the coating head.<br>
The apparatus that implements cross-linking may be for example an oven or an emitter of radiation, e. g. ultraviolet (UV) radiation or an emitter of a beam of electrons (EB).<br><br><br>
High speed coating of flexible supports with silicones has bten associated with problems associated with the transfer of the silicone liquid (or fluid) from the coating roll to the flexible support, which moves forward through the coating apparatus. On* of the particular problems associated wi||j transfer of the silicone liquid from the coating roll to the flexible support is the appearance of a fog, mist or aerosol in the immediate vicinity of the coating head and particularly cilose to the points of contact between the coating roll and the flexible support being coated. Typically, the density of this fog, mist or aerosol increases with an increase in the forward speed! of.the flexible support being coated by the apparatus,<br>
The first effect of this transfer problem is te reduce the amount of silicone liquid actually transferred to the flexible support,. A second effect  for the droplets comprising fee fog, mist or aerosol to condea.sp onto the newly coated flexible support downstream of the coating rolls creating ay fw*n»- peel effect, This orange peel effect, or coating non-uniformity, creates grpoiems with eover$|$, the mechanical properties of the coating, t,g. ruboff, and adhesion resistance.<br>
An additional problem caused by non-uniforn^ty in the coating is related to industrial hygiene and the safety of people operating tb^ coating equipment wjfio are working in the vicinity of the coating equipment.<br>

He star branched silicone compounds of th| present invention ar$ described as the reaction product of the following two compounds:<br>

multiplicity of hydrosilylation sites availably jbr reaction on each, gf the component molecules being reacted and the difficulties of reducing such a ito^hastic chemical reaction to an analytic description.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be made by neat reactions or by<br>
•' '	*"••"•	.	' *<br>
reactions where the reactants are diluted by solvent. Because of the lojng chain nature of the substituents in these materials, neat reactions, i.e. reactions conducted in the absence of any non-participating solvent, wit| Jend to produce products that conform to the molecular descriptions herein but posscpftng a more entangled macro-structure. If less entangled macro-structures of mese compounds are desin^i, the preparative reactions should be conducted in suitable sqlyent media, e.g. cyclic siloxanes, inert hydrocarbon solvents and the like.<br>
Many types of noble metal catalysts for this Ijydrosilylation reaction are known and such catalysts may be used for the reaction ijn the present instance, When optical clarity is required the preferred catalysts are catalysts that are soluble in the reactioq mixture. By noble metal, Applicants define Ri|, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Ft as noble metals<br>

5.96 grams (0.025 moles) of C 16- 18 alpha olpfm was mixed with 300 grams (0.031 moles) of a silylhydride terminated polydjmethylsiloxane and 5 ppm Pt as Karsteadt's catalyst. The reaction was heated and stirred at 95 -€ for approximately<br>

four hours to allow the olefin to add to this siloxane polymer. Quantitative chemical<br><br>
analysis of residual SiH indicated that the desired amount of hydrogen had been consumed in attaching the olefm to the siloxane..<br>
1,94 grams (0.0023 moles) of an ((MVi)2Q)
0.132 grams (0.0017 moles) of 1,5-hexadienf was diluted in 62 grams of Isopar C and added to the previous reaction mixture. The reaction was heated to 80-85 C for four hours. The viscosity of the mixture rose to greater  man 70,000 cps indicating a chain extending reaction. 0.039 grams of an alkyl amine was added and the mixture stirred for 1 hour. 308 gums of a vinyl terminated polydimethyl siloxanc of about 250 cps was added and the Isopar C was stripped from the solution. The reacting product was used in further testing as an anti misting compound.<br>
A laboratory test instrument consisting of two rubber coated wheels{| in contact with each other, and rotating at a controlled, meaaird speed that simulates coating on a paper coating machine was used to demonstrate the anti misting capability .of the compound from example 10.
