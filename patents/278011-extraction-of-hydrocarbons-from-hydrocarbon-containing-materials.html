[001] The present application is a Continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial Nos.<br>
12/174,139, filed July 16, 2008, and 12/053,126, filed March 21, 2008, and claims benefit of<br>
U.S. provisional application 60/973,964, filed September 20, 2007, each of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The present invention relates to the field of extraction of hydrocarbons from<br>
hydrocarbon-containing materials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] The liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction of fossil fuels, also called hydrocarbon-<br>
containing organic matter, in solid, semi-solid, highly viscous or viscous form (individually and<br>
jointly referred to as fossil fuels hereafter) have proven to be extremely challenging and<br>
difficult. As used herein, such fossils fuels include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon-<br>
containing organic matter within coal, oil shale, tar sands and oil sands (hereinafter jointly called<br>
tar sands), as well as crude oil, heavy crude oil, crude bitumen, kerogen, natural asphalt and/or<br>
asphaltene. The difficulty can in part be attributed to the fact that these fossil fuels include<br>
complex organic polymers linked by oxygen and sulfur bonds, which are often imbedded in the<br>
matrices of inorganic compounds.  A need exists to produce additional liquid hydrocarbon feed<br>
stock for the manufacture of liquid and gaseous fuels as well as for the production of various<br>
chemicals, Pharmaceuticals and engineered materials as the demand and consumption for<br>
hydrocarbon based materials increases.<br>
[004] Various technologies or processes have been developed to liquefy, solubilize and/or<br>
extract the fossil fuels. None of the prior art liquefaction, solubilization and extraction<br>
technologies or processes, however, has proven to be commercially viable on a large scale for all<br>
types of fossil fuels. This is due to the fact that all of the prior art technologies and processes for<br>
the liquefaction, solubilization or extraction of hydrocarbons developed to date are expensive to<br>
deploy and operate. Additionally, the prior art processes and technologies for the liquefaction,<br>
solubilization and/or extraction of hydrocarbons may be difficult to scale up, operate and/or<br>
control because of one or more of the following reasons: (1) operating at an inordinately<br>
elevated pressure; (2) operating at a very high temperature; (3) the need for expensive processing<br>
vessels and equipment that require the external supply of hydrogen under extreme conditions; (4)<br>
being subjected to a mixture, or composition, of two or more reagents, catalysts and/or<br>
promoters, which are frequently highly toxic and are neither renewable nor recyclable; (5)<br>
requiring to supply a special form of energy, e.g., microwave radiation; (6) long process times<br>
for partial liquefaction, solubilization or extraction; (7) requiring extraordinarily fine particles<br>
with a size of about 200 mesh (0.074 mm), which is profoundly difficult and costly to<br>
manufacture and handle; and (8) being incapable of recovering and recycling the necessary<br>
reagents, catalysts and/or promoters. Thus, there exists a need to provide additional techniques<br>
and processes for the increased recovery of hydrocarbon materials.<br>
[005] For primary drilling operations, it would be advantageous to employ a process that would<br>
enhance   solubilization   and   encourage   movement   of additional   or   trapped   hydrocarbon-<br>
containing organic matter that could then be recovered allowing existing pressure gradients to<br>
force the hydrocarbon-containing organic matter through the borehole. In particular, it would be<br>
useful to solubilize heavier hydrocarbons that usually remain in the reservoir through primary<br>
drilling operations.<br>
[006] For secondary and tertiary or enhanced oil recovery operations, it would be advantageous<br>
to employ a process that would enhance solubilization of oil to recover hydrocarbon-containing<br>
organic matter in the reservoir in a manner that is cost effect and that does not damage the<br>
reservoir. While effective methods and compositions exist for tertiary operations, current<br>
methods suffer due to expense of operations in comparison to the value of the produced<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[007] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method of extracting<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from a hydrocarbon-containing material, includes the<br>
steps of providing a first liquid including a turpentine liquid and contacting the hydrocarbon-<br>
containing material with the turpentine liquid such that an extraction mixture is formed, as well<br>
as residual material. The extraction mixture contains at least a portion of the hydrocarbon-<br>
containing organic matter and the turpentine liquid. The residual material includes non-soluble<br>
material from the hydrocarbon-containing material. The residual material can also includes a<br>
reduced portion of the hydrocarbon-containing organic matter in the circumstance where all such<br>
hydrocarbon-containing material has not been solubilized by the turpentine liquid and moved<br>
into the extraction mixture. The residual material is then separated from the extraction mixture.<br>
The extraction mixture is further separated into a first portion and a second portion. The first<br>
portion of the extraction mixture includes a hydrocarbon product stream that includes at least a<br>
portion of the hydrocarbon-containing organic matter extracted from the hydrocarbon-containing<br>
material.. The second portion of the extraction mixture includes at least a portion of the<br>
turpentine liquid. In one embodiment, substantially all of the turpentine liquid is recovered in<br>
the recycle stream.<br>
[008] In another embodiment, substantially all hydrocarbon-containing organic matter is<br>
extracted into the extraction mixture. In such embodiment, the residual materials are essential<br>
oil-free and can be further used or disposed without impact to the environment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] In one aspect, the present invention relates to a readily deployed composition for the<br>
extraction, liquefaction and/or solubilization of fossil fuels from coal, oil shale, tar sands and the<br>
like, as well as from reservoirs.<br>
[0014] According to one embodiment, a method is providing including the steps of liquefying,<br>
solubilizing and/or extracting hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from a hydrocarbon-<br>
containing material, such as for example, coal, oil shale, tar sands, or a reservoir containing<br>
heavy crude oil, crude oil, natural gas (which frequently coexists with crude oils and other said<br>
fossil fuels), or a combination thereof. Hydrocarbon-containing organic matter includes, but is<br>
not limited to, heavy crude oil, crude oil, natural gas and the like. Hydrocarbon-containing<br>
organic matter can be solid, semi-solid, liquid, sludge, viscous liquid, liquid or gaseous form.<br>
Other materials that are suitable hydrocarbon-containing materials for treatment using the<br>
method of this invention include liquid and solids that include hydrocarbon-containing materials<br>
as well as a residual material. Exemplary hydrocarbon-containing materials can also include oil<br>
tank bottoms, oil pit or pond sludge and slurry mix, discarded foods, manure, sewage sludge or<br>
municipal garbage. Liquefying, solubilizing and/or extracting the hydrocarbon-containing<br>
organic matter includes the step of providing a turpentine liquid, contacting the hydrocarbon-<br>
containing material with the turpentine liquid so as to extract at least a portion of said<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from said hydrocarbon-containing material into said<br>
turpentine liquid to create an extraction mixture that includes the hydrocarbon-containing<br>
organic matter that has been removed from the hydrocarbon-containing material and the<br>
turpentine liquid, and separating the extracted organic matter in the turpentine liquid from any<br>
residual material not extracted. Turpentine liquid can include an amount of terpineol. Naturally<br>
occurring turpentine liquid includes an amount of terpene. In one embodiment, the turpentine<br>
liquid includes ct-terpineol.<br>
[0015] In certain embodiments, the ratio of turpentine liquid to hydrocarbon-containing material<br>
is greater than or equal to about 1:2 and 4:1, in some embodiments greater than or equal to about<br>
1:1, and in some embodiments the ratio can be greater than or equal to 2:1 In embodiments<br>
relating the reservoir recovery, the ratio can be greater than or equal to about 3:1, and in other<br>
embodiments relating to reservoir recovery the ratio can be greater than or equal to about 4:1.<br>
For purpose of application in a reservoir, pore volume is used to determine an estimated measure<br>
of the hydrocarbon-containing material. In other aspects of this invention, such as in the use of<br>
tar sands and coal and oil shale, volume of the hydrocarbon-containing material can be more<br>
directly measured.<br>
[0016] In certain embodiments, the minimum organic matter contained in the hydrocarbon-<br>
containing material is greater than or equal to about 1% by weight, in other embodiments greater<br>
than or equal to about 10% by weight, and in still further embodiments greater than or equal to<br>
about 14% by weight of the hydrocarbon-containing material.<br>
[0017] In one embodiment of the invention, a liquefaction, solubilization or extraction reagent of<br>
choice for the hydrocarbon-containing matter is a natural, synthetic or mineral turpentine, which<br>
can include ot-terpineol, or a-terpineol itself.<br>
[0018] In certain embodiments, the liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction of fossil fuels or<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter can be carried out at a temperature, which is within the<br>
range of about 2°C to about 300°C. In certain embodiments, the organic matter or material is<br>
contacted with a turpentine liquid at a temperature of less than about 300°C, or less than about<br>
60°C. In other embodiments, the liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction temperatures can<br>
be within the range of about 20°C to about 200°C. The pressure under which the liquefaction,<br>
solubilization and/or extraction of fossil fuels is to be carried out may typically be within the<br>
range of about l.OxlO4 Pascals (0.1 atm) to about 5.0xl06 Pascals (50.0 atm). In certain<br>
embodiments, the process can be conducted at a pressure between about 5.0x104 Pascals (0.5<br>
atm) to about 8.0x105 Pascals (8.0 atm). In certain other embodiments, the fossil fuels or<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter to be liquefied, solubilized and/or extracted by<br>
immersion in, or contact with, one or more turpentine liquid can be in the form of a bed of<br>
particles, pieces, chunks or blocks of fossil fuels whose sizes are within the range of about 0.74<br>
mm to about 10 mm in a liquefaction, solubilization or extraction vessel (reactor hereafter) that<br>
contains one or more of the said liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction reagents. In certain<br>
embodiments, the sizes of the particles, pieces, chunks or blocks of fossil fuels are within the<br>
range of about 0.149 mm (100 mesh) to about 20 mm. In certain embodiments, the bed of<br>
particles, pieces, chunks or blocks of fossil fuels is agitated by passing the liquefaction,<br>
solubilization and/or extraction reagent or reagents in the form of liquid through the bed of<br>
particles, pieces, chunks or blocks by boiling the reagent or reagents. In certain embodiments,<br>
the duration of liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction is between about 1 minute to about<br>
90 minutes. The fossil fuels can be partially or fully liquefied, solubilized and/or extracted; the<br>
degree of liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction can be effected by controlling the<br>
operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, intensity of agitation and duration of<br>
operation, and/or adjusting the type, relative amount and concentration of the liquefaction,<br>
solubilization or extraction reagent or reagents in the reactor.<br>
[0019] The basis of one aspect of the present invention is the unexpected discovery that when<br>
about 500 grams of the reagent, a-terpineol, were added to about 250 grams of the 60-mesh<br>
sample of coal from the Pittsburgh seam in Washington County of Pennsylvania in a tray, the<br>
reagent's color turned pitch black almost immediately, and remained so after several hours. This<br>
indicated that the color change was not due to the suspension of the coal particles, but rather was<br>
indicative of the extraction of hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from the coal.<br>
Subsequently, this 2:1 mixture of a-terpineol and the coal sample was transferred from the tray<br>
to a capped and tightly sealed jar and was maintained under the ambient conditions of about<br>
20°C and slightly less than about 1.01 xlO5 Pascals (1 atm) for about 25 days. The conversion,<br>
(i.e., the degree of liquefaction), of the coal sample was determined to be about 71 wt. % after<br>
filtering, washing with ethanol, drying, and weighing. This 71 wt. % conversion corresponds to<br>
nearly all the solubilizable bitumen (organic matter) present in the coal sample whose proximate<br>
analyses are 2.00 wt. % of as-received moisture, 9.25 wt. % of dry ash, 38.63 wt. % of dry<br>
volatile matter, and 50.12 wt. % of dry fixed carbon. A series of subsequent experiments with<br>
coal, as well as oil shale and tar sands under various operating conditions, has shown that the<br>
family of reagents that includes natural and/or synthetic turpentines containing pinenes, and<br>
alcohols of pinene, i.e., terpineols, are inordinately effective in liquefying, solubilizing and/or<br>
extracting kerogen (organic matter), bitumen (organic matter) and/or asphaltene (organic matter)<br>
in the fossil fuels, including coal, oil shale, tar sands, heavy crude oil and/or crude oil, without<br>
requiring the aid of any catalyst or alkaline metals. These reagents, except mineral turpentine<br>
that is derived from petroleum, are renewable and "green," i.e., low in toxicity, and relatively<br>
inexpensive, as compared to all other known liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction<br>
reagents for the fossil fuels, such as tetraline, xylene, anthracene, and various solutions or<br>
mixtures of these reagents with other compounds. Even mineral turpentine derived from<br>
petroleum, although not renewable, is relatively low in toxicity and is inexpensive. It was also<br>
found that any of the said liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction reagents penetrates or<br>
diffuses into the particles, pieces, blocks or chunks of fossil fuels through their pores at<br>
appreciable rates, thus causing these particles, pieces, chunks or blocks to subsequently release<br>
the liquefiable, solubilizable or extractable fraction in them often almost nearly completely even<br>
under the far milder conditions, e.g., ambient temperature and pressure, than those required by<br>
the recent inventions pertaining to the liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction of the fossil<br>
fuels, such as coal, oil shale, tar sands, crude oil and heavy crude oil.<br>
[0020] An aspect of the present invention provides a method of liquefying, solubilizing and/or<br>
extracting the fossil fuels or hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from hydrocarbon-<br>
containing material, such as coal, oil shale and tar sands, wherein a portion of solid or semi-solid<br>
fossil fuels is contacted with a turpentine liquid in an extraction mixture, which can be in an<br>
absence of an alkali metal, catalyst, hydrogen (H2) and/or carbon monoxide (CO). While<br>
hydrogen and CO can be useful as a mixing agent, one embodiment of the invention includes the<br>
process and the composition in the absence of hydrogen and CO.<br>
[0021] In certain embodiments, the turpentine liquid is selected from natural turpentine,<br>
synthetic turpentine, mineral turpentine, pine oil, a-pinene, P-pinene, a-terpineol, P-terpineol, y-<br>
terpineol, polymers thereof, and mixtures thereof. In certain other embodiments, the turpentine<br>
liquid is selected from geraniol, 3-carene, dipentene (p-mentha-l,8-diene), nopol, pinane, 2-<br>
pinane hydroperoxide, terpin hydrate, 2-pinanol, dihydromycenol, isoboraeol, p-menthan-8-ol,<br>
a-terpinyl acetate, citronellol, p-menthan-8-yl acetate, 7-hydroxydihydrocitronellal, menthol, and<br>
mixtures thereof.     In other embodiments, the turpentine liquid is selected from anethole,<br>
camphene; p-cymene, anisaldeyde, 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene, isobomyl acetate, ocimene,<br>
alloocimene, alloocimene alcohols, 2-methoxy-2,6-dimethyl-7,8-epoxyoctane, camphor, citral,<br>
7-methoxydihydro-citronellal, 10-camphorsulphonic acid, cintronellal, menthone, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
[0022] According to an aspect, solid or semi-solid fossil fuels or other hydrocarbon-containing<br>
materials, such as coal, oil shale, tar sands and heavy crude oil, or for example oil tank bottoms,<br>
oil pit or pond sludge, discarded foods, manure, sewage sludge or municipal garbage, may be<br>
provided in any size that facilitates contact with a turpentine liquid. The fossil fuels or<br>
hydrocarbon-containing materials can be provided as particles, pieces, chunks, or blocks, for<br>
example, large fragments or pieces of coal or oil shale. According to a certain aspect of the<br>
invention, the fossil fuel or hydrocarbon-containing material is provided as particles. According<br>
to a certain aspect of the invention, the particles of fossil fuel or hydrocarbon-containing<br>
materials have an average particle size of from about 0.074 mm to about 100 mm. In certain<br>
other embodiments, the particles of fossil fuel have an average particle size from about 0.074<br>
mm to about 25 mm.<br>
[0023] According to an aspect of the present invention, a second liquid can be added to the<br>
turpentine liquid. According to a certain aspect of the invention, the second liquid can be<br>
selected from lower aliphatic alcohols, alkanes, aromatics, aliphatic amines, aromatic amines,<br>
carbon bisulfide and mixtures thereof. Exemplary mixtures include solvents manufactured in<br>
petroleum refining, such as decant oil, light cycle oil and naphtha, or solvents manufactured in<br>
dry distilling coal and fractionating liquefied coal.<br>
[0024] As used herein, lower aliphatic alcohols refers to primary, secondary and tertiary<br>
monohydric and polyhydric alcohols of between 2 and 12 carbon atoms. As used herein, alkanes<br>
refers to straight chain and branched chain alkanes of between 5 and 22 carbon atoms. As used<br>
herein, aromatics refers to monocyclic, heterocyclic and polycyclic compounds. As used herein,<br>
aliphatic amines refers to primary, secondary and tertiary amines having alkyl substituents of<br>
between 1 and 15 carbon atoms. In certain embodiments, benzene, naphthalene, toluene or<br>
combinations thereof are used. In another embodiment, the lower aliphatic alcohols noted above<br>
can be used. In one embodiment the solvent is selected from ethanol, propanol, isopropanol,<br>
butanol, pentane, heptane, hexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, anthracene, tetraline,<br>
triethylamine, aniline, carbon bisulfide, and mixtures thereof, at a temperature and pressure<br>
operable to maintain the solvent in liquid form.<br>
[0025] In certain embodiments, the ratio of turpentine liquid to any other turpentine-miscible<br>
solvent contained in said fluid is greater than or equal to 1:1, in certain embodiments greater than<br>
or equal to about 9:4. In certain embodiments, the ratio is greater than or equal to about 3:1. In<br>
yet other embodiments, the ratio is greater than or equal to 4:1.<br>
[0026] According to an aspect of the present invention, the fossil fuel and the turpentine liquid<br>
are contacted at a temperature of from about 2°C to about 300°C. In certain embodiments, the<br>
fossil fuel is contacted by the turpentine liquid at a temperature of less than about 200°C.<br>
[0027] According to a further aspect of the present invention, the fossil fuel and the turpentine<br>
liquid are contacted at a pressure of from about l.OxlO4 Pascals (0.1 atm) to about 5.0x106<br>
Pascals (50 atm). According to an aspect, the method is executed at a pressure of from about 0.5<br>
atm to about 8 atm.<br>
[0028] According to an aspect of the present invention, the method further includes providing an<br>
extraction vessel within which the solid or semi-solid fossil fuel is contacted with the turpentine<br>
liquid. According to an aspect, agitation means can be provided whereby the fossil fuel and the<br>
turpentine liquid contained within the reactor or extractor vessel are mixed and agitated.<br>
[0029] According to an aspect of the present invention, the fossil fuel and turpentine liquid can<br>
be incubated in a holding tank so as to prolong their time of contact. According to a further<br>
aspect, the degree of liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction is controlled by the length of<br>
time the solid or semi-solid fossil fuel is in contact with the turpentine liquid and/or the<br>
temperature of the mixture of the fossil fuel and turpentine liquid.<br>
[0030] According to an aspect of the present invention, the fossil fuel is contacted with a<br>
heterogeneous liquid including a turpentine liquid and water as an agitant.<br>
[0031] In certain embodiments, the ratio of turpentine fluid to water is greater than or equal to<br>
about 1:1 by volume, to avoid slurry formation, which may render separation of the extracted<br>
organic matter in the turpentine liquid-containing fluid difficult.<br>
[0032] According to an aspect of the present invention, the fossil fuel is contacted by the<br>
turpentine liquid in the presence of an energy input selected from thermal energy in excess of<br>
about 300°C, pressure in excess of 50 atm, microwave energy, ultrasonic energy, ionizing<br>
radiation energy, mechanical shear-forces, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0033] According to an aspect of the present invention, a liquefaction or solubilization catalyst is<br>
provided to the mixture of fossil fuel and turpentine liquid.<br>
[0034] According to an aspect of the present invention, the reaction or solubilization mixture is<br>
supplemented by the addition of a compound selected from hydrogen, carbon monoxide, water,<br>
metal oxides, metals, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0035] According to an aspect of the present invention, a microorganism is included in the<br>
reaction or solubilization mixture. Select chemical bonds, for example, sulfur cross-links and<br>
oxygen cross-links, in the hydrocarbons of fossil fuels and other hydrocarbon-containing<br>
materials are broken by biotreatment with bacillus-type thermophilic and chemolithotrophic<br>
microorganisms selected from naturally occurring isolates derived from hot sulfur springs. The<br>
breaking of these select chemical bonds facilitates the solubilization of hydrocarbons in fossil<br>
fuels and other hydrocarbon-containing materials.<br>
[0036] Still other aspects and advantages of the present invention, it will become easily apparent<br>
by those skilled in the art from this description, wherein it is shown and described certain<br>
embodiments of the invention, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated of<br>
carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different<br>
embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects,<br>
without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the description is to be regarded as<br>
illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.<br>
[0037] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for<br>
extracting hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from a hydrocarbon-containing material<br>
comprising a viscous liquid, liquid or gaseous fossil fuel material. The method provides a first<br>
liquid that includes a turpentine liquid. The turpentine liquid is contacted with the hydrocarbon-<br>
containing material in-situ in an underground formation containing said fossil fuel material,<br>
thereby forming an extraction mixture so as to extract hydrocarbon-containing organic matter<br>
into said turpentine liquid and form an extraction liquid. The extraction liquid is removed from<br>
said formation, wherein the extraction liquid includes the turpentine liquid containing the<br>
extracted hydrocarbon-containing organic matter. The extracted hydrocarbon-containing organic<br>
matter is separated from a residual material not extracted. The method can further include<br>
separating said extracted hydrocarbon material from the turpentine liquid. The viscous liquid,<br>
liquid or gaseous fossil fuel material can be heavy crude oil, crude oil, natural gas, or a<br>
combination thereof. The underground formation may be a crude oil reservoir or a natural gas<br>
reservoir, for example.<br>
[0038] The present invention can be deployed readily in-situ to liquefy and/or solubilize directly<br>
the fossil fuels in underground formations, and extract the resulting liquid products from such<br>
formations.<br>
[0039] An extraction reagent of the present invention is a liquid, which has a very strong physio-<br>
chemical affinity with bituminous organic matter, including bitumen, kerogen and/or tar, in solid<br>
coal, oil shale and tar sands. When the extraction reagent of the present invention and<br>
bituminous organic matter comprising mainly hydrocarbons come into direct contact with each<br>
other, the organic matter dissolves into the extraction reagent of the present invention, thereby<br>
liquefying the organic matters. Upon contact, the hydrocarbons and the extraction reagent of the<br>
present invention rapidly form a homogeneous solution, i.e., a one-phase liquid.<br>
[0040] It is possible to take advantage of the physico-chemical affinity between the extraction<br>
reagent of the present invention and the bituminous matter for enhancing oil recovery from oil<br>
reservoirs under in-situ conditions.   The prior art in-situ recovery techniques applied to-date in<br>
oil reservoirs resort mostly to the so-called frontal displacement method. This process is strictly<br>
controlled by the characteristics of the multi-phase fluid flow in a porous medium. This tends to<br>
leave a large portion, often exceeding about 40% of the original oil, unrecovered, even for the<br>
"good" low viscosity oil reservoirs. The extraction reagent of the present invention enhances oil<br>
recovery by overcoming the complex behavior of the multi-phase flow prevailing under in-situ<br>
conditions.<br>
[0041] The present invention takes advantage of the very strong physico-chemical affinity of the<br>
turpentine liquid.<br>
[0042] One method of the present invention injects an extraction reagent of the present invention<br>
into an oil or natural gas reservoir through an injection well.<br>
[0043] Oil is dissolved into the extraction reagent of the present invention when the two come<br>
into contact in an oil reservoir, thereby yielding a homogeneous solution, i.e., a one-phase liquid.<br>
The extraction reagent of the present invention does not simply displace the oil as it travels from<br>
the injection well to the producer well; dissolution of previously trapped oil into the extraction<br>
reagent of the present invention continues until the extraction reagent is fully saturated with oil.<br>
Thereafter, the extraction reagent becomes inactive in the additional oil recovery process and<br>
simply flows through the pores of the reservoir as a one-phase liquid, eventually reaching a<br>
production well.<br>
[0044] The following illustrates three specific embodiments of in-situ methods for oil recovery<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[0045] In a first in-situ embodiment, about three (3.0) to seven (7.0) pore volumes of an<br>
extraction reagent of the present invention are injected into an oil reservoir already water-flooded<br>
to the residual oil saturation while producing about 51% of the original oil in the reservoir. The<br>
injection of the extraction reagent can unexpectedly produce about an additional 41% of the<br>
original oil in the reservoir. This embodiment of the method was experimentally validated, as<br>
described in Example 22 herein below.<br>
[0046] In a second in-situ embodiment, about two (2.0) to five (5.0) pore volumes of an<br>
extraction reagent of the present invention are injected into an oil reservoir. At the outset, the<br>
injection causes only oil to be produced until about one-third (0.3) to three-quarter (0.75) of pore<br>
volume of the extraction reagent of the present invention is injected; thereafter, the extraction<br>
reagent of the present invention in which oil is dissolved, is produced. The majority of the oil<br>
present can be recovered upon injecting between about one and a half (1.5) to three and a half<br>
(3.5) pore volumes of the reagent. The method unexpectedly recovers about 90% of the original<br>
oil in the reservoir. This embodiment of the method also is experimentally validated, as<br>
described in Example 22 herein below.<br>
[0047] In a third in-situ embodiment, an extraction reagent of the present invention is injected to<br>
improve the oil recover from oil reservoirs containing very viscous oil, e.g., the reservoirs of the<br>
"Orinoco Oil Belt" in Venezuela. The recovery factor with prior art recovery methods is low,<br>
ranging from 10% to 15% of the original oil in such reservoirs. The unexpected increase in the<br>
recovery efficiency from these reservoirs with injection of the turpentine liquid extraction<br>
reagent of the present invention can be further enhanced by adopting horizontal wells for both<br>
producers and injectors, and periodic steam soaking of these wells.<br>
[0048] Ultimate recovery of natural gas from a large gas reservoir can be increased with the<br>
injection of an extraction reagent of the present invention into a reservoir. The gas production<br>
form such a reservoir often creates dangerously large-scale subsidence on the surfaces of the gas<br>
field, e.g., the "Groeningen" field in the Netherlands. As such, it is necessary that the reservoir<br>
pressure be maintained by water injection. The water injected into the reservoir traps about 30%<br>
of the gas in-situ at high pressure due to the two-phase flow of water and gas through the<br>
reservoir with a low permeability. With the injection of an extraction reagent of the present<br>
invention, the trapped gas in the reservoir is dissolved in the reagent and flows to the producer<br>
wells. By separating the reagent and gas at the surface, the gas is recovered and the reagent is<br>
recycled for reuse.<br>
[0049] The extraction methods of the present invention can be implemented after one or more of<br>
the known methods for facilitating oil production, e.g., CO2 or natural gas injection and<br>
surfactant addition, are executed.<br>

[0084] In another aspect, a method for optimizing a turpentine liquid for extraction of<br>

Generally, the method includes providing a sample of the hydrocarbon-containing material and<br>
analyzing the hydrocarbon material to determine the type ofhydrocarbon being extracted. A<br>
formulation for extraction of hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from the hydrocarbon<br>

of the particulate hydrocarbon material. Generally, the formulation includes at least about 40%<br>
by volume a-terpineol and at least about 10% by volume P-terpineol. The amount of a-terpineol<br>
and P-terpineol in the formulation is then adjusted based upon the parameters noted above, hi<br>
general, while the above noted method provides a good starting point for determining the desired<br>
formulation for extraction of various hydrocarbon containing materials, for other hydrocarbon-<br>
containing materials and under specified operating conditions, either a series of statistically<br>
designed experiments or a series of experiments according to an optimization method can be<br>
performed to determine the optimum composition of the liquid turpentine.<br>
[0085] As shown in Table 1, the specific formulation for extraction, liquefaction and/or<br>
solubilization of hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from tar sands varies based upon the<br>
particle size, hi certain embodiments, the method for preparing a turpentine liquid for extracting<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from tar sands includes adjusting the amount of <x-></x->
terpineol and P-terpineol in the formulation as a function of the size of the hydrocarbon rich solid<br>
particulate being extracted. In other embodiments, if the hydrocarbon-containing organic<br>
particulate matter includes low grade coal or an oil shale, the amount a-terpineol in the<br>
turpentine liquid is increased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased.<br>
In other embodiments, if the hydrocarbon-containing organic particulate matter includes tar<br>
sands, the amount a-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol<br>
in the turpentine liquid is increased. In other embodiments, if the hydrocarbon-containing<br>
organic particulate matter includes tar sands and the mean diameter of the particulate matter is<br>
less than about 4.76 mm, then the amount a-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and<br>
the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is increased. In other embodiments, if the<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic particulate matter includes tar sands and the mean diameter of<br>
the particulate matter is greater than about 1 inch (1 mesh), then the amount a-terpineol in the<br>
turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is increased.<br>
<br>
[0086] Similar to what is shown above with respect to the extraction of tar sands, as shown in<br>
Tables 2 and 3, the formulation for extraction, liquefaction and/or solubilization of coal depends<br>
both on particle size and on the quality of the coal being extracted. In one embodiment of the<br>
method for preparing a turpentine liquid for extracting hydrocarbon-containing organic matter, if<br>
the hydrocarbon-containing matter includes anthracite, bituminous coal, or other high grade coal<br>
and the mean diameter of the particulate matter is less than about 0.15 mm, then the amount a-<br>
terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine<br>
liquid is increased. In other embodiments, if the hydrocarbon rich particulate matter includes<br>
anthracite, bituminous coal, or other high grade coal and the mean diameter of the particulate<br>
matter is greater than about 0.84 mm, then the amount a-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is<br>
decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is increased. In another<br>
embodiment, if the hydrocarbon rich particulate matter includes low grade coal and the mean<br>
diameter of the particulate matter is less than about 0.074 mm, then the amount a-terpineol in the<br>
turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is increased.<br>
In another embodiment, if the hydrocarbon rich particulate matter includes low grade coal and<br>
the mean diameter of the particulate matter is greater than about 0.42 mm, then the amount a-<br>
terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine<br>
liquid is increased.<br>
[0087] Similar to what is shown above with respect to the extraction of tar sands, as shown in<br>
Table 4, the formulation for extraction, liquefaction and/or solubilization of oil shale depends on<br>
particle size. In one embodiment of the method for preparing a composition for extracting<br>
hydrocarbon-containing organic matter, if the hydrocarbon rich particulate matter includes an oil<br>
shale and the mean diameter of the particulate matter is less than about 0.074 mm, then the<br>
amount a-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in the<br>
turpentine liquid is increased. In another embodiment, if the hydrocarbon rich particulate matter<br>
includes oil shale and the mean diameter of the particulate matter is greater than about 0.42 mm,<br>
then the amount a-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-terpineol in<br>
the turpentine liquid is increased.<br>
[0088] The extraction of crude oil similarly depends on the type of crude oil being extracted,<br>
liquefied, and/or solubilized. As shown in Table 5, the formulation for the extraction,<br>
liquefaction and/or solubilization of crude oil depends is a function of both particle size and the<br>
quality of the density of the crude oil being extracted. The method includes providing a<br>
turpentine liquid formulation that includes at least 50% by volume a-terpineol and at least 20%<br>
by volume P-terpineol; adjusting the amount of a-terpineol and P-terpineol in the turpentine<br>
liquid formulation based upon the density of the liquid hydrocarbon being extracted. In one<br>
embodiment, if the API gravity of the liquid hydrocarbon being extracted is greater than about<br>
22°, then the amount a-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased and the amount of P-<br>
terpineol in the turpentine liquid is increased. In another embodiment, if the API gravity of the<br>
liquid hydrocarbon being extracted is less than about 22, then the amount a-terpineol in the<br>
turpentine liquid is increased and the amount of P-terpineol in the turpentine liquid is decreased.<br>
As used herein, light oils have an API of at least about 31 °, medium crude oils have an API of<br>
between about 22° and about 31*, heavy oil has an API of between about 10° and about 22°, and<br>
extra heavy oil has an API of less than about 10°.<br>
<br>
[0089] In another aspect, a method for preparing a turpentine liquid for enhancing recovery of<br>
liquid hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from a sub-surface formation is provided. The<br>
method includes providing a formulation comprising at least 50% by volume a-terpineol and at<br>
least 20% by volume P-terpineol, and adjusting the amount of a-terpineol and P-terpineol in the<br>
formulation based upon the geological features of the sub-surface formation.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0092] Example 1. In this example, coal from the Pittsburgh seam in Washington County,<br>
Pennsylvania was liquefied with reagent a-terpineol.   The coal sample was obtained from the<br>
Coal Bank at Pennsylvania State University, which provided the following proximate analyses<br>
for it; 2.00 wt. % of as-received moisture, 9.25 wt. % of dry ash, 38.63 wt. % of dry volatile<br>
matter, and 50.12 wt. % of dry fixed carbon. The particle size of coal sample was about 60<br>
mesh. About 60 grams of a-terpineol was gently added to about 30 grams of the coal sample<br>
placed in an extraction vessel, thus giving rise to the reagent-to-sample ratio of 2 to 1. The<br>
capped, but not tightly sealed, extraction vessel containing the resultant mixture of a-terpineol<br>
and coal was maintained at the constant temperature of about 96°C and continually agitated.<br>
Without boiling the a-terpineol, the pressure in the extraction vessel remained at the ambient<br>
pressure of slightly less than about l.OlxlO5 Pascals (1 atm). After about 30 minutes, the<br>
mixture was filtered and the coal particles retained on the filter were washed with ethanol and<br>
dried to a constant weight. On the basis of weight loss, the conversion, i.e., the extent of<br>
liquefaction, of the coal sample was determined to be about 68 wt. %.<br>
[0093] Example 2. This example is identical to Example 1 in all aspects except two. After<br>
maintaining the temperature at about 96°C, for about 30 minutes, as done in Example 1, the<br>
extraction vessel containing the coal sample and a-terpineol was maintained at a temperature at<br>
about 135°C for an additional period of about 30 minutes. The pressure in the extraction vessel<br>
remained at the ambient pressure of slightly less than about l.OlxlO5 Pascals (1 atm). The<br>
conversion, i.e., the degree of liquefaction, of the coal sample was determined to be about 70 wt.<br>
%.<br>
[0094] Example 3. The coal sample used was from the same source with the same proximate<br>
analyses as those used in the preceding two examples. About 31 grams of a-terpineol were<br>
added to about 31 grams of the coal sample in an extraction vessel . The mixture was maintained<br>
at about 96°C and an ambient pressure of slightly less than about l.OlxlO5 Pascals (1 atm) for<br>
about 30 minutes. The conversion, i.e., the degree of liquefaction, of the coal sample attained<br>
was determined to be about 71 wt. % by weighing the sample after filtering, washing, and drying<br>
as done in the preceding two examples.<br>
[0095] Example 4. This example is identical to Example 3, except that about 30 wt. % of a-<br>
terpineol was replaced with hexane, providing a reagent that includes 70 wt.% a-terpineol and 30<br>
wt. % hexane. This reduced the conversion, i.e., the degree of liquefaction to about 1.3 wt. %.<br>
[0096] Example 5. The source and proximate analyses of coal sample and experimental<br>
conditions in terms of temperature, pressure and reagent-to-sample ratio for this example were<br>
the same as those of Example 3. The duration of the extraction, however, was reduced from<br>
about 30 minutes to about 20 minutes. Additionally, about 30 wt. % of the a-terpineol was<br>
replaced with 1-butanol, providing a reagent that includes 70 wt.% a-terpineol and 30 wt. % 1-<br>
butanol. The amount of coal liquefied was only about 0.30 gram, corresponding to conversion of<br>
about 1.0 wt.%.<br>
[0097] Example 6. This example is the same as Example 3 in terms of the source and proximate<br>
analyses of coal sample and temperature, pressure and duration of the extraction. The amount of<br>
the coal sample used was, however, about 25 grams and the reagent comprised about 24 grams<br>
(80 wt. %) of a-terpineol and about 6 grams (20 wt. %) of xylenes, providing a reagent that<br>
includes 70 wt.% a-terpineol and 30 wt. % xylenes. The coal liquefied was about 10.0 grams,<br>
corresponding to conversion of about 40 wt. %.<br>
[0098] Example 7. In this example, coal from the Wyodak seam in Campbell County, Wyoming<br>
was liquefied with reagent a-terpineol. The coal sample was obtained from the Coal Bank at<br>
Pennsylvania State University, which provided the following proximate analyses for it; 26.30 wt.<br>
% of as-received moisture, 7.57 wt. % of dry ash, 44.86 wt. % of dry volatile matter, and 47.57<br>
wt. % of dry fixed carbon. The coal sample's particle size was about 20 mesh. About 60 grams<br>
of a-terpineol was gently added to about 30 grams of the coal sample placed in an extraction<br>
vessel , a reagent-to-sample ratio of about 2 to 1. The capped, but not tightly sealed, extraction<br>
vessel containing the resultant mixture of a-terpineol and coal was maintained at a constant<br>
temperature of about 96°C and continually agitated. Without boiling of the a-terpineol, the<br>
pressure in the extraction vessel remained at the ambient pressure of slightly less than about<br>
1.01x105 Pascals (1 atm). After about 30 minutes, the mixture in the extraction vessel was<br>
filtered and the coal particles retained on the filter were washed with ethanol and dried to a<br>
constant weight. On the basis of weight loss, the conversion, i.e., the degree of liquefaction, of<br>
the coal sample was determined to be 75 wt. %.<br>
[0099] Example 8. The experiment in this example was carried out under the conditions<br>
identical to those of the preceding example except one. About 15 grams of a-terpineol were<br>
added, instead of about 60 grams, as done in the preceding example, to about 30 grams of the<br>
coal sample, thus attaining the reagent-to-coal ratio of 0.5 to 1. The conversion, i.e., the degree<br>
of liquefaction, of the coal sample attained decreased from about 75 wt. %, attained in the<br>
preceding example, to about 69 wt. %.<br>
[00100]          Example 9.   In this example, about 3 grams of oil shale from the Green-river<br>
region of Colorado was solubilized with about 9 grams of a-terpineol, thus giving rise to the<br>
reagent-to-sample ratio of 3 to 1, to extract kerogen (organic matter) and/or bitumen (organic<br>
matter) from it. The organic carbon content, including both volatile and fixed carbon, was<br>
determined to be about 22.66 wt. % by a certified analysis company. Two experiments with the<br>
oil-shale samples, having the particle size of 60 mesh, were carried out under the ambient<br>
temperature and pressure of about 25°C and slightly less than about 1.01 xlO5 Pascals (1 atm),<br>
respectively. The weight losses of the samples were determined by weighing after filtering,<br>
washing with ethanol, and drying. These losses were about 9 wt. % after about 30 minutes and<br>
about 17 wt. % after about 45 minutes. From these weight losses, the conversion, i.e., the degree<br>
of extraction of organic matter, i.e., kerogen and/or bitumen, was estimated to be about 40 wt. %<br>
for the former and was about 75 wt. % for the latter.<br>
[00101]          Example 10. This example duplicated the preceding example with the exception<br>
that a single experiment, lasting about 15 minutes, was carried out at the temperature of about<br>
96°C, instead of about 25°C. The weight loss of the oil shale sample was about 12 wt. %,<br>
corresponding to the conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of kerogen (organic matter) of<br>
about 53 wt. %<br>
[00102]          Example 11. In this example, bitumen (organic matter) in tar sands from Alberta,<br>
Canada, was solubilized and extracted with commercial grade synthetic turpentine. The tar-<br>
sands sample was obtained from Alberta Research Council, which provided the following<br>
proximate analyses for it; 84.4 wt. % of dry solids, 11.6 wt. % of dry bitumen, and 4.0 wt. % of<br>
as-received moisture. About 30 grams of synthetic turpentine were gently added to about 15<br>
grams of the tar-sands sample in a capped, but not tightly sealed, extraction vessel , utilizing a<br>
reagent-to-sample ratio of about 2 to 1 by weight. This extraction vessel , containing the<br>
resultant mixture of synthetic turpentine and tar sands, was maintained at a constant temperature<br>
of about 96°C and continually agitated. Without boiling of the synthetic turpentine, the pressure<br>
in the extraction vessel remained at the ambient pressure of slightly less than about 1.01 xlO5<br>
Pascals (1 atm). After about 20 minutes, the mixture in the extraction vessel was filtered and the<br>
solids (tar sands) retained on the filter were washed with ethanol and dried to a constant weight.<br>
On the basis of weight loss, the conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen from the<br>
tar-sands sample was determined to be about 100 wt. %.<br>
[00103]          Example 12.  In this example, about 60 grams of the tar-sands sample from the<br>
same source with the same proximate analyses as those of the preceding example were extracted<br>
by about 60 grams of a-terpineol, instead of commercial-grade synthetic turpentine, which<br>
includes a-terpineol. The resultant reagent-to-sample ratio was 1 to 1 instead of 2 to 1 as in the<br>
preceding example. The experiment lasted about 30 minutes at the temperature of about 96°C<br>
under the ambient pressure of slightly less than about l.OlxlO5 Pascals (1 atm). The conversion,<br>
i.e., the extent of extraction, of bitumen (organic matter) in the tar-sands sample was determined<br>
to be about 100 wt. %.<br>
[00104]          Example 13. In this example, about 60 grams of the tar-sands sample from the<br>
same source with the same proximate analyses as those of the preceding two examples were<br>
extracted by about 60 grams of synthetic turpentine, which is of the commercial grade. The<br>
resultant reagent-to-sample ratio, therefore, was about 1 to 1. The experiment was carried out for<br>
about 30 minutes at the temperature of about 96°C under the ambient pressure of slightly less<br>
than about l.OlxlO5 Pascals (1 atm). The conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen<br>
(organic matter) in the tar-sands sample was determined to be about 70 wt. %.<br>
[00105]          Example 14. The experiment in this example duplicated that in Example 8 in all<br>
aspects except that the reagent-to-sample ratio was reduced from about 2 to 1 to about 0.5 to 1:<br>
About 60 grams to the tar-sands sample was extracted by about 30 grams of synthetic turpentine,<br>
which is of the commercial grade. The conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen<br>
(organic matter) decreased from about 100 wt. % attained in Example 9 to about 70 wt. %.<br>
[00106]          Example 15. The experiment in this example repeated that of the preceding<br>
example with a-terpineol instead of the commercial-grade synthetic turpentine. The conversion,<br>
i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen (organic matter) in the tar-sands sample was about 70<br>
wt. % as in the preceding example.<br>
[00107]          Example 16. The experiment in this example was carried out under the ambient<br>
pressure of slightly less than about 1.01 xlO5 Pascals (1 atm) with the tar-sands sample from the<br>
same source with the same proximate analyses as those in the preceding examples with tar sands.<br>
About 60 grams of commercial-grade synthetic turpentine was added to about 60 grams of the<br>
tar-sands sample, thus giving rise to the reagent-to-sample ratio of about 1 to 1. The temperature<br>
of the sample and commercial-grade synthetic turpentine was maintained at about 65°C for about<br>
30 minutes followed by cooling to about 15°C within about 5 minutes. Subsequently, the tar-<br>
sands sample was filtered, washed, dried and weighed. On the basis of weight loss, the<br>
conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen (organic matter) in the tar-sands sample was<br>
determined to be about 70 wt. %.<br>
[00108]          Example 17.   The experiment in this example repeated that of the preceding<br>
example with a-terpineol instead of commercial grade synthetic turpentine. The conversion, i.e.,<br>
the degree of extraction, of bitumen (organic matter) increased to about 90 wt. % from about 70<br>
wt. % of the preceding examples.<br>
[00109]          Example 18. In this example, a tar-sands sample, weighing about 30 grams, from<br>
the same source with the same proximate analyses as those in Examples 11 through 17, was<br>
extracted with a liquid that included about 20 grams (80 wt. %) of a-terpineol and about 5 grams<br>
(20 wt. %) of toluene at the temperature of about 96°C under the ambient pressure of slightly less<br>
than about l.OlxlO5 Pascals (1 atm). The duration of the experiment (reaction or extraction<br>
time) was about 30 minutes. The weigh loss of the sample was about 10.2 grams. From this<br>
weigh loss, the conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen (organic matter) was<br>
estimated to be about 33 wt. %.<br>
[00110]          Example 19. Three tar-sands samples, all from the same source with the same<br>
proximate analyses as those used in all preceding examples with tar sands were extracted by<br>
reagents comprising various amounts of a-terpineol and ethanol at the temperature of about 15°C<br>
under the ambient pressure of slightly less than about 1.01 xlO5 Pascals (1 atm). The duration of<br>
each experiment (reaction or extraction time) was about 15 minutes for each tar-sands sample.<br>
The first sample was extracted with a mixture comprising about 0 gram (0 wt. %) of a-terpineol<br>
and about 15 grams (100 wt. %) of ethanol, i.e., with pure ethanol. The second sample was<br>
extracted with a mixture comprising about 7.5 grams (50 wt. %) of a-terpineol and about 7.5<br>
grams (50 wt. %) of ethanol. The third sample was extracted with a mixture comprising about<br>
12 grams (80 wt. %) of a-terpineol and about 3 grams (20 wt. %) of ethanol. The weight losses<br>
and the estimated conversions, i.e., the degrees of extraction, of bitumen (organic matter) in the<br>
three samples were about 0.2 gram (1.0 wt. %), 0.6 gram (3.0 wt. %) and 0.9 gram (4.5 wt. %),<br>
for the first, second and third sample, respectively.<br>
[00111 ]          Example 20. Irregular-shaped pellets of commercial-grade asphalt whose average<br>
size was about 15 mm were solubilized and extracted with a-terpineol and at the ambient<br>
temperature of about 22°C under the ambient pressure of slightly less than about l.OlxlO5<br>
Pascals (1 atm). The first sample weighing about 20 grams was solubilized and extracted with<br>
about 40 grams of a-terpineol, and the second sample also weighing about 20 grams was<br>
solubilized and extracted with about 20 grams of a-terpineol.   Both samples were completely<br>
dissolved after 30 minutes. These experiments were carried out to simulate the solubilization<br>
and extraction of heavy crude oil, which tends to be rich in asphaltenes like asphalt.<br>
[00112]          Example 21.   In this example, bitumen (organic matter) in tar-sands from the<br>
same source with the same proximate analyses as those used in all previous examples with tar<br>
sands was solubilized and extracted with two varieties of vegetable oils, soybean oil and com oil.<br>
The vegetable oils are completely miscible with turpentine liquid. In the first experiment, a tar-<br>
sands sample weighing about 15 grams was blended and agitated continually with about 30<br>
grams of soybean oil for about 20 minutes at the temperature of about 96°C under the ambient<br>
pressure of slightly less than about 1.01 xlO5 Pascals (1 atm). The weight loss was about 0.5<br>
gram from which the conversion, i.e., the degree of extraction, of bitumen in the sample was<br>
estimated to be about 3.3 wt. %. In the second experiment, a tar-sands sample weighing about<br>
30 grams was blended and agitated continually with about 60 grams of corn oil for about 30<br>
minutes at the temperature of about 175°C under the ambient pressure of slightly less than about<br>
l.OlxlO5 Pascals (latm). The weight loss was about 4.8 grams from which the conversion, i.e.,<br>
the degree of extraction, of bitumen in the sample was estimated to be about 12 wt. %.<br>
[00113]          Example 22. Two tests were performed on Berea sandstone plug core samples to<br>
determine the effect of reagent injection on oil recovery from core. The first test was designed to<br>
determine the increment oil recovery due to a- terpineol injection after a field had already<br>
undergone waterflooding to the limit. The selected core contained 9.01 mL of laboratory oil<br>
simulating crude oil. The waterflooding with aqueous solution containing 3.0% of potassium<br>
chloride produced 4.6 mL of oil. Five (5) pore volumes of a-terpineol injection produced<br>
additional 3.61 mL of oil, thereby leaving the core with less than 8.0% of oil remaining in the<br>
original volume. The second test was designed to represent the increased recovery that could be<br>
expected from a virgin reservoir with a-terpineol injection. The selected core contained 8.85 mL<br>
of laboratory oil simulating crude oil. Oil production began after approximately 0.5 pore<br>
volumes of a-terpineol injection, which was continued until 3.5 pore volumes; however, the<br>
majority of the oil was recovered after only 2.5 pore volumes of a-terpineol injection. A total of<br>
7.94 mL of laboratory oil was recovered, thereby leaving the core with less than 7.5% of oil<br>
remaining in the original volume.<br>
[00114]          In one experiment, various different ratios of a turpentine liquid to tar sand<br>
sample were tested. The turpentine liquid for each of the experiments provided below had the<br>
same formulation, wherein the composition included about 60% by volume a-terpineol, about<br>
20% by volume pMerpineol, and about 20% by volume y-terpineol. The tar sands were a<br>
different mix of ores from Alberta, Canada, having a bitumen content of approximately 12% by<br>
weight and a water content of between about 4-5% by weight. The experiments were all<br>
performed at atmospheric temperature.<br>
[00115]          As shown in Table 6 below, recovery of hydrocarbons from tar sands across all<br>
ratios provided below (i.e., ratios of turpentine liquid to tar sands ranging from 1:2 to 2:1)<br>
resulted in good recovery of hydrocarbons and little discernible difference. With respect to the<br>
temperature at which the extraction is carried out, it is believed that the optimum temperature for<br>
the extraction, solubilization and/or liquefaction of hydrocarbons from tar sands is 65°C. As<br>
shown in the table, at about 130°C, the amount of hydrocarbons recovered is reduced. It is noted<br>
however, that for certain solids from which it is particularly difficult to recover hydrocarbons,<br>
increasing the temperature of the extraction solvent can increase the amount of hydrocarbons that<br>
are recovered.   Finally, it is shown that exposure time had very little effect on the amount of<br>
materials that were extracted. This is likely because the shortest extraction time was 20 minutes,<br>
which is believed to be more than adequate for the extraction of the hydrocarbons from tar sands.<br>
<br>
[00116]          Additional  experiments  were  conducted  using  alternative  solvents,  namely<br>
ethanol and corn oil, which was compared with the composition that included about 60% by<br>
volume a-terpineol, about 20% by volume P-terpineol, and about 20% by volume y-terpineol.<br>
As noted in Table 7 provided below, the performance of ethanol and corn oil were unexpectedly<br>
substantially lower than the composition that included 60% by volume a-terpineol, about 20% by<br>
volume P-terpineol, and about 20% by volume y-terpineol. For example, whereas the terpineol<br>
composition achieved complete or nearly complete extraction of extractable hydrocarbons,<br>
ethanol yielded only 10% of the recoverable hydrocarbons and heated corn oil yielded only 33%<br>
of the recoverable hydrocarbons.<br>
[00117]          As shown in Table 8 below, the performance of various turpentine liquid<br>
formulations, including turpentine liquid formulations that include only a-terpineol and ot-<br>
terpineol in combination with various known organic solvents, are provided. The first three<br>
compositions presented in the table include a-terpineol, P-terpineol, and y-terpineol. For<br>
example, the first same includes about 60% by volume a-terpineol, about 30% by volume |3-<br>
terpineol, and about 10% by volume y-terpineol. The results unexpectedly show that as the<br>
concentration of the a-terpineol increases, performance of the turpentine liquid increases to the<br>
point that when the turpentine liquid includes approximately 70% a-terpineol, full extraction of<br>
the hydrocarbon material from the tar sand sample is achieved.<br>
[00118]          The second set of data is presented for extraction of hydrocarbon bearing tar<br>
sands with pure a-terpineol. As shown, extraction of greater than 100% is achieved, likely due<br>
to inconsistencies in the hydrocarbon content of the samples.   However, the results generally<br>
demonstrate the unexpected result that a-terpineol is capable of extracting substantially all of the<br>
recoverable hydrocarbon from a tar sand sample.<br>
[00119]          Finally, the last data provided in Table 8 illustrates the effectiveness of mixed<br>
systems of a-terpineol and known organic solvents. As shown, substantially complete recovery<br>
of recoverable hydrocarbons is achieved with a composition that includes a 1:1 ratio of a-<br>
terpineol to ethanol. This is unexpected as pure ethanol only removed about 10% of the total<br>
recoverable hydrocarbons. Additionally, mixed systems that include either a 1:1 or a 3:1 ratio of<br>
a-terpineol to toluene still resulted in the recovery of 77% and 92% of the total recoverable<br>
hydrocarbons. This was an unexpected result.<br>
[00120]           The results for the extraction of hydrocarbon-containing organic matter from<br>
hydrocarbon-containing material described in the specification, and especially in the Examples<br>
above, were unexpected.<br>
