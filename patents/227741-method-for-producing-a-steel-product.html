				<td>Method for producing a steel product<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a steel product which has a high yield<br>
strength. The product according to the invention can, in particular, be a steel sheet or a<br>
steel strip.<br>
A light steel used for producing body components and for low temperature use is<br>
known from DE 197 27 759 C2. In addition to Fe it contains 10% to 30 % Mn, 1 % to<br>
8 % A1 and 1 to 6 % S, the total of the A1 and Si contents not exceeding 12 %. In this<br>
known steel carbon is at best contained in the impurities range.<br>
In the light constructional steel known from DE 199 00 199 A1, on the other hand,<br>
carbon is provided as in optional alloy element. The known light steel comprises &gt; 7<br>
% to 27 % Mn, &gt; 1 % to 10 % Al, &gt; 0.7 % to 4 % Si, 
Ni and 
total of these elements must not exceed 2 %.<br>
Steels of the above-described type have TWIP properties ("TWIP" = "Twinning<br>
Induced Plasticity"). This property means that they exhibit high ductility while at the<br>
same time having gocd rigidity and a low weight. Accordingly, an extremely good<br>
product can be ascertained from tensile strength and elongation for TWIP light<br>
constructional steel. In steel sheets produced from known TWIP light constructional<br>
steels the minimum yield strength is conventionally in the range of 260 to 330 MPa.<br>
Even higher yield strengths while simultaneously retaining good ductility can, for<br>
example, be achieved with TRIP steels ("TRIP" = "Transformation Induced<br>
Plasticity") or in steels in which mixed TWIP and TRIP properties exist. However, all<br>
variations of known sheets produced from light constructional steels of this type have<br>
specific disadvantageous properties when they have yield strengths of more man 330<br>
MPa. Thus, for example scatterings of the brittle-ductile transition temperature,<br>
temperature-dependent properties or an anisotropic deformation behaviour can occur.<br>
The object of the invention therefore consisted in disclosing a method which allows<br>
reliable production of steel products from a light steel, which products, even at high<br>
yield strengths, have an isotropic deformation behaviour and are ductile at low<br>
temperatures.<br>
This object is achieved by a method for producing a steel product, in particular a steel<br>
sheet or steel strip,<br>
- wherein a steel strip or sheet is produced from steel which contains (in % by<br>
weight):<br>
and iron and unavoidable impurities as the remainder.<br>
- from which strip or sheet the finished steel product is subsequently produced by cold<br>
forming that takes place at a degree of cold forming of 2 to 25 %.<br>
According to the invention, high yield strengths of the finished steel products are<br>
adjusted by a cold forming method to which the steel strip is subjected after it has<br>
passed through the conventional steel strip production steps. Starting from light steels<br>
of the composition stipulated according to the invention products may be produced<br>
from both hot strips and cold strips in the manner according to the invention, which<br>
products have high yield strengths while still having good ductility. It is essential here<br>
that cold forming is carried out with sufficient degrees of forming to conclude the<br>
production of the hot or cold strip.<br>
The cold forming according to the invention can, for example, be carried out by skin<br>
pass rolling or stretcher-and-roller levelling of the steel sheet or strip. In these cases<br>
the product produced according to the invention is a steel strip or sheet, of which the<br>
yield strength is regularly above 330 MPa.<br>
These yield strengths which likewise reliably maintain a minimum value may also be<br>
achieved in that the cold forming carried out according to the invention is part of a<br>
process for producing a finished component form. Thus the cold forming completed<br>
in the final step of the method according to the invention may, for example, also be<br>
carried out as deep drawing, stretch forming or hydroforming. The only factor which<br>
is essential is that an adequate degree of forming is achieved which is above the<br>
degree of forming normal in conventional skin pass rolling.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that, starting from the steel alloy used according to the<br>
invention, a clear increase in the yield strengths occurs owing to the cold forming,<br>
without subsequent repeated annealing, carried out to conclude the production<br>
method, without decisive losses in the isotropy or the ductility of the material<br>
occurring as a result. Thus the products produced according to the invention, in<br>
particular sheets or strips, are characterised by an optimum combination of ductile<br>
yield and yield strength. In addition, they have TWIP properties. As such they are<br>
clearly superior to conventionally produced and composed light steel products. It is<br>
therefore possible with the method according to the invention to simply produce light<br>
steel products with rraximum yield strengths and which are characterised by good<br>
ductility at low weigh).<br>
The reliability with which the working result made possible according to the invention<br>
is achieved can be improved in that the degree of cold forming is 15 % maximum, in<br>
particular 10 % maximum.<br>
Hot strips or cold strips may be used as the starting products for producing steel<br>
products according to the invention. The production of hot strips can include the<br>
conventional method steps. Thus a steel with the composition according to the<br>
invention can be cast to form slabs, thin slabs or cast strip. These fabricated products<br>
are then hot rolled to form a hot strip which is wound into coils.<br>
After winding, the hot strip obtained can be cold formed directly in the manner<br>
according to the invention into a product according to the invention. Alternatively the<br>
hot strip can firstly be cold rolled to form a cold strip which is subsequently<br>
recrystallisation annealed before it is subjected to cold forming with degrees of cold<br>
forming of 2 % to 2.5 %, again as the final step in the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
If reheating is required prior to hot rolling, in particular in the case of the use of slabs,<br>
the reheating temperature should not be below 1,100 °C. On the other hand, in such<br>
cases in which, after casting, the starting product is fed to the hot rolling operation in<br>
a continuous operations sequence, this can also take place in direct use without<br>
interposed reheating.<br>
As, according to the invention, the hot strip is hot rolled at final hot rolling<br>
temperatures of at least 800 °C and is wound at low temperatures, the positive effect<br>
of the carbon, and if it is present, in particular the boron, is used in full. Thus in sheets<br>
hot rolled in this range boron and carbon cause higher tensile strength and yield<br>
strength values at ductile yield values that are still acceptable. Tensile strength and<br>
yield strength decrease with increasing final hot rolling temperature, while the<br>
elongation values increase. By varying final the rolling temperatures within the<br>
framework stipulated by the invention, the desired properties of the steel sheet<br>
obtained may thus be influenced in a targeted and simple manner.<br>
Embrittlement of the material is reliably avoided by limiting the winding temperature<br>
to values of 700 °C maximum. It has been established mat at elevated winding<br>
temperatures the formation of brittle phases can occur which, for example, can result<br>
in flaking of material and as such make further processing difficult or even<br>
impossible.<br>
If the steel product is produced from a cold strip, the degree of cold rolling during<br>
cold rolling preceding recrystallisation annealing is preferably in the range of 30 % to<br>
75 % in order to reliably attain the optimised ductility and rigidity properties of the<br>
finished steel product according to the invention.<br>
The annealing temper;itures during recrystallisation annealing is preferably between<br>
600 °C and 1,100 °C. Annealing can be carried out in a bell-type annealing furnace in<br>
the temperature range from 600 ºC to 750 °C or in a continuous annealing furnace at<br>
temperatures from 750 °C to 1, 100 °C.<br>
As a result of the Si contents restricted to contents above 2.50 % by weight,<br>
preferably above 2.70 % by weight, steel sheets according to the invention exhibit<br>
improved capacity for cold rolling compared with light steel sheets or steel sheets of<br>
this type which have lower Si contents. The high addition of Si is expressed in more<br>
uniform yield strength and tensile strength values and in higher ductile yield and<br>
uniform elongation values. Furthermore, in steels according to the invention, silicon<br>
leads to higher and values and to an isotropic formation of the mechanical<br>
properties. The upper limit of the total formed from A1 and Si contents lies at 12% as<br>
a A1 and Si contents total that goes beyond this limit would entail the risk of<br>
embrittlement.<br>
Surprisingly it has teen found that the purposeful addition of boron to steels<br>
according to the invention can lead to an improvement in the properties and the<br>
producability. Therefore, according to an advantageous configuration of the invention<br>
it is provided that the steel comprises boron. If boron is added to improve the<br>
adjustment of yield strength and ductility, the boron content can, in this respect, lie in<br>
the range of 0.002 % by weight to 0.01 % by weight, in particular 0.003 to 0.008 %<br>
by weight.<br>
The advantageous effects of the alloy on the mechanico-technologial properties of<br>
steel sheets according to the invention can be boosted further if a minimum amount of<br>
0.10 % by weight cart on can be detected in the steel according to the invention.<br>
As a result of it:; particular property spectrum, crash-relevant vehicle body<br>
components and vehicle body components that are particularly supportive may be<br>
produced from cold strip products produced, in particular, in a manner according to<br>
the invention. These components can be used, with a low weight, for example for<br>
particularly effective protection of the occupants cf a vehicle. Products produced<br>
according to the invention are characterised in this connection by a particularly high<br>
energy absorption capacity in the event of a sudden lead.<br>
The low weight with good ductility and rigidity at the same time also make it possible<br>
to produce wheels for vehicles, in particular motor vehicles, from products produced<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Components which arc used in the field of low temperature engineering may also be<br>
produced from products produced according to the invention. The advantageous<br>
property spectrum of cold strip products produced according to the invention is<br>
retained even at low temperatures conventional in the cryotechnics sector.<br>
The good energy absorption capacity achieved with the method of production<br>
according to the invention also makes the method of the invention particularly<br>
suitable for producing products which are used for producing protective elements<br>
intended for protectior against impulse-type loads.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter with reference to embodiments.<br>
A light steel comprising (details in % by weight) 0.0070 % C, 25.9 % Mn, 0.013 % P,<br>
0.0006 % S, 2.83 % Si, 2.72 % A1, 0.0045 % N and the remainder being iron and<br>
unavoidable impurities which include, for example, small contents of Cu, Cr, Ni, As,<br>
Sn, Ti, V, Nb, B and Mg, was cast to form slabs.<br>
After reheating to 1,150 °C the slabs were hot rolled at a final hot rolling temperature<br>
of 850 °C to form a hot strip and then wound at a wilding temperature of 500 °C. The<br>
hot strip was then col i rolled, at a degree of forming of 65 %, to form, a cold strip 1<br>
mm thick. After cold rolling, the cold strip was recrystallisation annealed in a<br>
continuous annealing furnace at a temperature of 950 °C.<br>
In this state the cold strip was isotropic. Its mechanical properties ascertained in the<br>
longitudinal direction in each case are entered in Table 1 (degree of cold forming = 0<br>
%).<br>
Table 1<br>
To prove the effect of the invention, after recrystallsation annealing, portions of the<br>
cold strip were cold rolled with a degree of forming of 2.5 %, 5 %, 10 %, 30 % and 50<br>
%. The mechanical properties ascertained in the longitudinal direction in each case for<br>
each of the portions are also entered in Table 1.<br>
It appears that in the cold strip product obtained after skin pass rolling, an optimum<br>
combination of elongation limits and yield strengths is obtained if a degree of cold<br>
forming of 10 % was maintained during skin pass rolling of the cold strip. Thus up to<br>
a degree of cold forming of 10 % the yield strength Rp0.2 could be increased by more<br>
than 70 % and the tensile strength Rm improved by more than 10 %. The values of the<br>
uniform elongation A the A80 elongation, the r value and the n value remained at a<br>
level which is far above that which is achieved in conventional steels of comparable<br>
yield strength, Only at a degree of cold forming of 30 % does a dramatic decrease in<br>
the elongation properties occur.<br>
In a further test a further cold strip corresponding, with respect to its composition and<br>
the working steps completed until conclusion of its recrystallisation annealing, to the<br>
cold strip described above was produced. A hollow profile-like crash body was<br>
produced from a portion of this cold strip, without prior cold forming, A further<br>
portion of the recrystallisation annealed cold strip, by contrast, was cold formed by<br>
skin pass rolling in a n.anner according to the invention with a degree of cold forming<br>
of 7 %, A hollow profile-like crash body was then likewise produced from the cold<br>
strip product produced according to the invention in this way.<br>
The two crash bodies, weighing approximately 150 kg, were then investigated with<br>
respect to their energy absorption capacity in a drop test in which they hit an obstacle<br>
at a rate of fall of 50 km/h. It appeared that the crash body produced from the cold<br>
strip product skin pass rolled according to the invention had a much better energy<br>
absorption capacity, despite the fact that its wall thickness was much reduced,<br>
compared with that of the other crash body, owing to the additional cold forming.<br>
Finally, in a third test a recrystallisation annealed cold strip was produced, again<br>
based on the above-stated composition and by using the method steps already<br>
described. The thus composed cold strip was then cold formed in the manner<br>
according to the invention by stretch forming. The degree of cold forming achieved in<br>
the process was again 10 %. As a result of this cold forming the yield strength of 320<br>
MPa could be increased only in the recrystallisation annealed state to 520 MPa after<br>
the cold forming following recrystallisation annealing. The tensile strengths<br>
simultaneously increased from 640 MPa to 710 MPa The r value was barely affected.<br>
With an increasing degree of forming the elongation values decreased from 60 % to<br>
about 50 % and the n value from 0.39 to 0.27 but even these values were much higher<br>
than the elongation properties and n values that can be determined in comparable<br>
conventionally produced steels which are more rigid and of the same yield strength<br>
class. Even in the case of cold forming of the cold strip by skin pass rolling, the<br>
product obtained thus had an optimum combination of yield strength values and<br>
elongation values.<br>
