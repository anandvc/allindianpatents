INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of high purity crystalline base of Granisetron, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. More particularly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of high purity (&gt;99.9%) crystalline base of Granisetron and its pharmaceutically acceptable hydrochloride salt. Granisetron base and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known antiemetic drug.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Granisetron is currently being used in the anticancer chemotherapy. It is 1 -methyl-TV-[(3-en<io having the structural formula as given below:></io>
It is shown to be a potent and selective 5-hydroxy tryptamine 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It was also shown to be a highly effective inhibitor of cytotoxic drug and x-ray irradiation induced emesis.<br>
Granisetron was first developed and disclosed by Beecham group (GB), in their European Patent Application EP 200444; corresponding to US 4886808. According to Example (6) of EP 200444, Granisetron of the formula (1) can be prepared by reacting a solution of 1-methyl indazole-3-carboxylic acid chloride in dichloromethane with a solution of endo-9-methyl-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-amine and triethylamine in dichloromethane. After the normal workup and subsequent evaporation of the solvent, Granisetron base was obtained as an oil. This oil was purified by using column chromatography and reacted with hydrogen chloride to give the desired compound, Granisetron Hydrochloride (mp: 290-2°C).<br><br>
In this patent the preparation of the starting material, l-methyl-indazole-3-carbonyl chloride was not disclosed and also the reaction conditions for the condensation of acid chloride with endo-amine was not disclosed. Moreover this process is not suitable for industrial production of the drug as it involves the purification by column chromatography, which is not practicable and cumbersome process.<br>
Other processes for preparing Granisetron were later disclosed. International application WO 95/23799, discloses an alternative process for preparing Granisetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which process comprises deprotecting a compound of structure (2),<br><br>
where R is a nitrogen- protecting group which does not significantly reduce the nucleophilicity of a secondary amino group and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
International application WO 97/30049, discloses an alternative process for preparing Granisetron, by cyclisation of a previously methylated compound of formula (3),<br><br>
Although the said international application discloses a process for preparing Granisetron, by methylation followed by cyclisation, it should be noted that the yield from the last steps might be very low.<br><br>
International Application WO 03/080606, discloses an alternative process for preparing Granisetron, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, which comprises: (a) cyclisation of a compound of formula (4), in an inert solvent and at a temperature between 0-100°C in the presence of a strong acid in order to yield the compound of the formula (5).<br><br>
(b) methylation of the compound of the formula (5), with an alkylating agent, in the presence of a base, in an inert solvent and at a temperature between 0-160°C and optionally obtaining a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
According to the process disclosed in examples (3) of the above said patent WO 03/080606, the Granisetron Base (residue) obtained, is having a purity of 77.7% and m.p: 121-122°C and when this base was converted to Granisetron Hydrochloride, its purity was enhanced to 92%.<br>
Similarly, according to the process disclosed in Example (4) of the above said patent the purity of Granisetron Base was 84.1% and that of Hydrochloride salt was 94% only.<br>
In the same way, the process disclosed in Example (5) of the above said patent, gives the Granisetron base purity as 84.7% and that of hydrochloride as 96%. The Example (6) gives the Granisetron base purity as 86% and that of hydrochloride salt as 97%.<br><br>
By any means, the Granisetron base obtained by the process disclosed in the above said patent WO 03/080606 was having a maximum purity of 86% and that of hydrochloride was 97% only, which is not acceptable for pharmaceutical use as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API).<br>
Thus, there is a need for a highly pure Granisetron base or its pharmaceutically acceptable hydrochloride salt, which can be produced industrially.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of crystalline and highly pure (&gt;99.9%) Granisetron base of the formula (1),<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the manufacture of salts of Granisetron, preferably the hydrochloride, in which the crystalline and highly pure (&gt;99%) granisetron base is used.<br>
The crystalline base of Granisetron prepared according to the present invention has a melting<br>
point between 148 - 152°C, more preferably between 150 - 152°C.  Whereas its purity is more<br>
than 99.6%, preferably more than 99.8%, most preferably more than 99.9% by HPLC (% area)<br>
and the following identified and pharmacoepial listed impurities are in the range of 0 to 0.05%<br>
(% area)<br>
(i)       endo-N- (9-methyl-9-azabicyclo [3.3.1] non-3-yl)-2-methyl-2H-indazole-3-carboxamide<br>
(ii)      endo-N- (9-methyl-9-azabicyclo [3.3.1]non-3-yl -lH-indazole-3-carboxamide<br>
(iii)     endo-N- (9-azabicyclo [3.3.1] non-3-yl)-1 -methyl-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamide<br>
(iv)      1 -methyl-1 H-indazole-3 -carboxylic acid<br>
(v)       exo-N-(9-methyl-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1 ]non-3-yl)-1 -methyl-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamide<br>

(vii)     1 H-indazole-3 -carboxylic acid<br>
(viii)   (1 -methylindazol-3-yl)carboxylic anhydride<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of high purity(&gt;99.9% by HPLC) crystalline Granisetron base of the formula (1),<br><br>
which comprises,<br>
(i) suspending the crude base of granisetron in a protic solvent or a mixture of protic solvents, such as alcohols, at 25-35°C, cooling to a temperature in the range of 0 to 15°C, preferably 0 to 5°C and stirring for a period in the range of one to three hours.<br>
(ii) filtering the crystals so formed in the alcoholic solvent medium used in step (ii), by conventional techniques, washing the crystals with the same solvent and if necessary drying the crystalline Granisetron base formed under vacuum and if desired,<br>
(iii) converting the Granisetron base obtained in step (ii) above into its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof by conventional techniques.<br>
The alcoholic solvent used in step (i) may be selected from, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, etc., preferably, isopropyl alcohol.<br>
Granisetron base prepared according to the present invention was found to be a stable crystalline solid with very high melting point (150 - 152°C) and high purity (&gt; 99.9% by HPLC area %). The melting point observed by us is nearly 30°C higher than the prior art melting point. This process for preparation of high purity Granisetron crystals is novel and simple. It avoids the cumbersome column chromatography purification disclosed in prior art method.<br><br>
If desired the granisetron base (wet or dry) as obtained in step (ii) above, can be further converted into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as hydrochloride in a commercially simple and viable process.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of high purity (&gt;99.8%) hydrochloride salt of Granisetron from the crystalline Granisetron base of formula (1),<br>
which comprises, <br>
(a)	suspending the crystalline Granisetron base (wet or dry) obtained in step (ii) of the process defined above in aqueous or non-aqueous alcoholic solvent or a mixture thereof<br>
(b)	treating the resultant suspension with molar quantity of aqueous or alcoholic hydrochloric acid<br>
(c)	filtering off the resulting Granisetron hydrochloride salt formed and washing the wet cake with the same solvent and if necessary, drying it<br>
(d)	dissolving the wet or dry Granisetron hydrochloride in a polar solvent such as water, alcohols, amides, nitriles, esters, and the like or a mixture thereof<br>
(e)	treating the resultant solution with a decolorizing agent<br>
(f)	filtering   off  the   decolorizing   agent   from   the   solution   containing   the   Granisetron hydrochloride<br>
(g)	distilling off the solvent partially from the solution and cooling to a temperature in the range of 25-35°C<br>
(h) filtering the resulting crystalline salt of Granisetron hydrochloride by conventional methods and washing the wet cake with same solvent and drying it<br><br>
The starting compound namely endo-N-(9-methyl-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-yl)-l-methyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide may be prepared by any known conventional methods, for example, by the method described in Example 6 of EP 200444.<br>
The aqueous or non-aqueous alcoholic solvent used in step (a) is selected from the methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, preferably isopropanol. The polar solvent used in step (d) is selected from water; alcohols like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, preferably isopropanol; amides like N,N-dimethylformamide; nitriles like acetonitrile; esters like ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The decolorizing agent used in step (e) is for example activated charcoal.<br>
Accordingly, the process of the present invention for preparing hydrochloride salt of Granisetron is very high yielding (&gt;90%), commercially feasible with pharmaceutical^ acceptable quality.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are not intended to limit the effective scope of this invention in any way.<br>

Into an all glass reactor, charged chloroform (12L), followed by l-methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid (2Kg) and N,N-dimethylformamide (0.2L). Then slowly added thionyl chloride (4Kg) at room temperature. Raised the mass temperature to reach reflux condition and maintained at reflux condition for 4 hr. Checked the completion of the reaction by HPLC. Then distilled off chloroform and excess thionyl chloride completely under vaccum. Cooled the reaction to room temperature and added chloroform (5L) and again distilled off chloroform completely under vacuum. Repeated the operation one more time with fresh chloroform (5L). Cooled the reaction mass to room temperature. As the acid chloride is an unstable compound, dissolved the acid chloride in methylene chloride (40L) and kept the reaction mass under nitrogen atmosphere till proceed to next stage. A small sample was taken, triturated with n-hexane, quickly filtered under nitrogen atmosphere and dried under vacuum and checked IR and M.P. The IR spectrum showed a strong band at 1748 cm'1 and MP is 122°C.<br><br>

Granisetron base of formula (1),<br>
which comprises, <br>
(i) suspending the crude base of Granisetron in a protic solvent or a mixture of protic solvents,<br>
such as alcohols, at 25-35°C, cooling to a temperature in the range of 0 to 15°C, preferably 0<br>
to 5°C and stirring for a period in the range of one to three hours (ii) filtering the crystals so formed in the alcoholic solvent medium used in step (ii), by<br>
conventional techniques, washing the crystals with the same solvent and if necessary drying<br>
the crystalline Granisetron base formed under vacuum and if desired, (iii) converting the Granisetron base obtained in step (ii) above into its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof by conventional techniques<br>
2.	An improved process for the preparation of high purity (&gt;99.9% by HPLC) crystalline Granisetron base as claimed in claim 1 where in the alcoholic solvent used in step (i) is selected from isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, preferably, isopropyl alcohol.<br>
3.	An improved process for the preparation of a high purity (&gt;99.8%) hydrochloride salt of Granisetron from the crystalline Granisetron base,<br>
which comprises,<br>
(a)	suspending the crystalline Granisetron base (wet or dry) obtained in step (ii) of the process defined in claim 1 above in aqueous or non-aqueous alcoholic solvent or a mixture thereof<br>
(b)	treating the resultant suspension with molar quantity of aqueous or alcoholic hydrochloric acid<br><br>
(c)	filtering off the resulting Granisetron hydrochloride salt formed and washing the wet cake with the same solvent and if necessary, drying it<br>
(d)	dissolving the wet or dry Granisetron hydrochloride in a polar solvent such as water, alcohols, amides, nitriles, esters, and the like or a mixture thereof<br>
(e)	treating the resultant solution with a decolorizing agent<br>
(f)	filtering   off the   decolorizing   agent   from   the   solution   containing   the   Granisetron hydrochloride<br>
(g)	distilling off the solvent partially from the solution and cooling to a temperature in the range of25-35°C<br>
(h) filtering the resulting crystalline salt of Granisetron hydrochloride by conventional methods and washing the wet cake with same solvent and drying it<br>
4.	An improved process for the preparation of a high purity (&gt;99.8%) hydrochloride salt of Granisetron from the crystalline Granisetron base as claimed in claim 3 wherein the non-aqueous alcoholic solvent used in step (a) is selected from methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isoproyl alcohol, preferably isopropyl alcohol.<br>
5.	An improved process for the preparation of a high purity (&gt;99.8%) hydrochloride salt of Granisetron from the crystalline Granisetron base as claimed in claims 3 &amp; 4 where in the polar solvent used in step (d) is selected from a group consisting of alcohols like methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol with or without water or amides like N,N-dimethylformamide or nitriles like acetonitrile or esters like ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or a mixture thereof.<br>
6.	An improved process for the preparation of a high purity (&gt;99.8%) hydrochloride salt of Granisetron from the crystalline Granisetron base as claimed in claims 3 to 5 wherein the decolorizing agent used in step (e) is selected as activated charcoal.<br>
7.	An improved process for the preparation of crystalline, high purity (&gt;99.9% by HPLC) Granisetron base of formula (1) given in claim 1 as herein described with reference to the Examples 2 &amp; 5.<br><br>
8. An improved process for the preparation of hydrochloride salt from high purity (&gt;99.9% by HPLC) Granisetron base of formula (1) given in claim 1 as herein described with reference to the Examples 3? 4, and 6 to 10.<br><br></td>
