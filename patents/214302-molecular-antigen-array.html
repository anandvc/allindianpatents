				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is about a composition useful in production of vaccine. More particularly about molecular antigen array related to the fields of molecular biology, virology, immunology and medicine. The invention provides a composition comprising an ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array. The invention also provides a process for producing an antigen or antigenic determinant in an ordered and repetitive array. The ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant is useful in the production of vaccines for the treatment of infectious diseases, the treatment of allergies and as a pharmaccine to prevent or cure cancer and to efficiently induce self-specific immune responses, in particular antibody responses.<br>
Background Art<br>
WO 00/3227 describes compositions and processes for the production of ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays. The compositions are useful for the production of vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases, the treatment of allergies and the treatment of cancers. The compositions comprise a core particle, such as a virus or a virus-like particle, to which at least one antigen or one antigenic determinant, is associated by way of at least one non-peptide bond leading to the ordered and repetitive antigen array.<br>
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are being exploited in the area of vaccine production because of both their structural properties and their non-infectious nature. VLPs are supermolecular structures built in a symmetric manner from many protein molecules of one or more types. They lack the viral genome and, therefore, are noninfectious. VLPs can often be produced in large quantities by heterologous expression and can be easily be purified.<br><br>
Examples of VLPs include the capsid proteins of Hepatitis B viius (Ulrich, et al..<br>
Vims Res. 50:141-182 (1998)), measles virus CWames, et aL, Gene 760:173-178 (1995)),<br>
Sindbis virus, rotavirus (US 5,071,651 and US 5,374,426), foot-and-mouth-disease virus<br>
(Twomey, et al.. Vaccine ii:1603-1610, (1995)), Norwalk virus (Jiang, X., et al.. Science<br>
250:1580-1583 (1990); Matsui, SJvl., et aL, J. ain. Invest. <1456-l461 the></1456-l461>
retrovira! GAG protein (WO 96/30523), the retrotransposon Ty protein pi, the surface protein<br>
of Hepatitis B virus (WO 92/11291) and human papilloma virus (WO 98/15631).<br>
It is generally difficult to induce imraune responses against self-molecules due<br>
to immunological tolerance. Specifically, lymphocytes with a specificity for self-molecules are usually hypo- or even unresponsive if triggered by conventional vaccination strategies.<br>
The amyloid B peptide (APi has a central role in the neuropathology of Alzheimers disease. Region specific, extracellular accumulation of Ap peptide is acconqjanied by microgliosis, cytoskeletal changes, dystrophic neuritis and synaptic loss. These pitfhological alterations are thought to be linked to the cognitive decline that defines the disease.<br>
In a mouse model of Alzheim disease, transgenic animals engineered to produce Ai,42 (PDAPP-nace), develop plaques and neuron damage in their brains. Recent work, has shown immunization of young PDAPP-mice, using Api-«2, resulted in inhibition of plaque formation and associated dystrophic neuritis (Schenk, D. et al.. Nature 400:113-71 (1999)).<br>
Furthermore immunization of older PDAPP mice that had already developed AD-like neuropathologies, reduced the extent and progression of the neuropathologies. The immunization protocol for these studies was as follows; peptide was dissolved in aqueous buffer and mixed 1:1 with complete Freunds adjuvant (for primary dose) to give a peptide concentration of 100/ig/dose. Subsequent boosts used incomplete Freunds adjuvant. Mice received 11 immimizations over an 11 month period Antibodies tities greater than 1:10 000 were achieved and maintained. Hence, immunization may be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic action against Aizheirnet disease.<br>
In another study, peripherally administered antibodies raised against Apj,<br>
were able to cross the blood-brain barrier, bind A peptide, and induce clearance of<br>
pre-existing amyloid (Bard, F. et al.. Nature Medicine 6:916-19 (2000)). This study<br>
utilized either polyclonal antibodies raised against APM2, or monoclonal antibodies<br>
raised against synthetic ftgments derived from different regions of Ap. Thus<br>
induction of antibodies can be considered as a potential therapeutic treatment for<br>
Alzheimer disease.<br>
It is well established that the administration of purified proteins alone is<br>
usually not sufficient to elicit a strong immune response; isolated antigen generally<br><br>
 must be given together with helper substances called adjuvants. Within these adjuvants, the administered antigen is protected against rapid degradation, and the adjuvant provides an extended release of a low level of antigen.<br>
As indicated, one of the key events in Alzheimer"s Disease (AD) is the<br>
deposition of amyloid as insoluble fibrous masses (amyloidogenesis) resulting in<br>
extracellular nenritic plaques and deposits around the walls of cerebral blood vessels<br>
(for review see Selkoe, D. J. (1999) Nature. 399, A23-31). The major constituent of<br>
the neuritic plaques and congophilic angiopathy is amyloid B (Afi), although these<br>
deposits also contain other proteins such as glycosaminoglycans and apolipoproteins.<br>
AB is proteolyticaily cleaved from a much larger glycoprotein known as Amyloid<br>
Precursor Proteins (APPs), which comprises isoforms of 695-770 amino acids with a<br>
single hydrophobic transmembrane region. A6 fonns a group of peptides up to 43<br>
amino acids in length showing considerable amino- and carboxy-terminal<br>
heterogeneity (tmncation) as well as modifications (oher, A. E., Palmer, K. C,<br>
Chau, v., &amp; BaU, M. J. (19S8) J. Cell Biol. 107, 2703-2716.	Roher, A. E.,<br>
Palmer, K- C, Yurewicz, E. C, Ball, M. J., &amp; Greenberg, B. D. (1993) J. Neurochem. 61,1916-1926). Prominent isoforms are A" 1-40 and 1-42. It has a high propensity to form 6-sheets aggregating into fibrils, which ultiniately leads to the amyloid. Recent studies demonstrated that a vaccination-induced reduction in train amyloid deposits resulted in cognitive improvements (Schenk, D., Barbour, R., Dunn, W., Gordon, G., Grajeda, H., Chiido, T., Hu, K., Huang, J., Johnson-Wood, K., Khan, K., et al. (1999) Nature. 400,173-177).<br>
We have surprisingly found that self-molecules or self-antigens presented in a highly ordered and repetitive array were able to efficiently induce self-specific inmaune responses, in particular antibody responses. Moreover, such responses could<br>
, even be induced in the absence of adjuvants that otherwise non-specifically activate antigen presenting cells and other immune cells.<br><br>

In further preferred embodiment of the invention, the recombinant proteins of the RNA-phages comprise mutant coat proteins.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the core particle comprises, or alternatively consists of, one or more different Hepatitis core (capsid) proteins (HBcAgs). In a related embodiment, one or more cysteine residues of these HBcAga are either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue (e.g., a serine residue), hi a specific embodiment, the cysteine residues of the HBcAg used to prepare compositions of the invention which correspond to amino acid residues 48 and 107 in SEQ ID NO: 134 are either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue {e.g., a serine residue).<br>
Further, the HBcAg variants used to prepare compositions of the invention will generally be variants which retain the ability to associate with other HBcAgs to form dimeric or multimeric structures that present ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays.<br>
Jn another embodiment, the non-natural molecular scaffold comprises, or altCTuatively consists of, pili or pilus-like structures that have been either produced fix&gt;m pilin proteins or harvested from bacteria. When pih or pilus-hke structures are used to prepare compositions of the invention, they may be formed from products of pilin genes which are naturally resident in the bacterial cells bat have been modified<br><br>
by genetically engineered ie.g., by homologous recombination) or pilin genes which have been introduced into these cells.<br>
In a related embodiment, the core particle comprises, or alternatively consists of, pili or pilus-like structures that have been either prepared from pilin proteins or harvested from bacteria. Tliese core particles may be formed from products of pilin genes naturally resident in the bacterial cells.<br>
hi a particular embodiment, the oranizK" may comprise at least one first<br>
attachment site. The first and the second attachment sites are particularly important<br>
elements of compositions of the invention. In various embodiments of the invention,<br>
the first and/or the second attachment site may be an antigen and an antibody or<br>
antibody fragment thereto; biotin and avidin; strepavidin and biotin; a receptor and its<br>
ligand;   a   ligand-binding   protein   and   its   ligand;   intK"acting   leucine   zipper<br>
polypeptides; an amino group and a chemical group reactive thereto; a carboxyl group<br>
and a chemical group reactive thereto; a sulfliydiyl group and a chemical group<br>
reactive thereto; or a combination thereof.<br>
In a further preferred embotMment, ftie composition further comprises an<br>
amino acid linker. Preferably the amino acid hnker comprises, or alternatively<br>
consists of, the second attachment site. The second attachment site mediates a<br>
directed and ordered association and binding, respectively, of the antigen to the core<br>
particle. An important function of the amino acid linker is to further ensure proper<br>
display and accessibility of the second attachment site, and thus to facilitate the<br>
binding of the antigen to the core particle, in particular by way of chemical cross-<br>
Unldng. Another important property of ihe amino acid linker is to further ensure<br>
optimal accessibility and, in particular, reactivity of the second attachment site. These<br>
properties of the amino acid linker are of even more importance for protein antigens.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the amino acid linker is selected from the group consisting of (a) CGG; (b) N-terminal gamma I-Iinker; (c) Nterminal gamma 3-Uiikfir, (d) Ig hinge regions; (e) N-terminSl glycine linkers; (f) (G)kC (G)i, with ii=fl-12 and k=0-5; (g) N-termin&amp;I glycine-serine linkers; (h) (G)iC(G)n,(S)i(GGGGS)n with n=0-3, k=0"5, m=0-10,1=0-2; (i) GGC; (k) GGC-NH2; (1) C-tenninal gamma 1-linker; (m) C-lerminal gamma 3-linker, (n) C-teiminal glycine linkers; (o) {G)iiCtG)i: with n=0-12 and kHD-5; (p) C-terminal glycine-serine linkers; (q) (G)o(S)i(GGGGS)n(G)aC(G)k with n=0-3, k=0-5, m=0-10,1=0-2, and o=K)-8.<br>
An important property of glycine and glycine serine linkers is their flexibility, in particular their structural flexibility, allowing a wide range of conformations and disfavoring folding into structures precluding accessibility of the second attachment<br><br>
■site. As glycine and glycine serine linkers contain either no or a limited amount of side chain residues, they have limited tendency for engagement into extensive interactions with the antigen, thus, farther ensuring accessibility of the second attachment site. Serine residues within the glycine serine linkers confer improved solubility properties to these linkers. Accordingly, the insertion of one or two amino acids either in tandem or isolation, and in particular of polar or charged amino acid residues, in the glycine or glycine serine amino acid linker, is also encompassed by the teaching of the invention.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the amino acid Unker is either GGC-NH2, GGC-NMe, GGC-N(Me)2, GGCNHET or GGC-N(Et)2, in which the C-terminus of the cysteine residue of GGC is amidated. Tliese amino acid linkers are preferred in particular for peptide antigens, and in particular for embodiments, in which die antigen or antigenic determinant with said second attachment site comprises AP peptides or fragments theerof. Particular preferred is GGC-NH2.In another embodiment, the amino acid Bnker is an Immunoglobulin (Ig) hinge region. Fragments of Ig hinge regions are also within the scope of the invention, as well as Ig hinge reons modified with glycine residues. Preferably, the Ig hinge regions contain only one cysteine residue. It is to be understood, that the single cysteine residue of the Ig hinge region amino acid linker can be located at several posidons within the linker sequence, and a man skilled in the art would know how to select them with the guidance of the teachings of this invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides the coupling of almost any antigen of choice to the surface of a virus, bacterial pilus, structure formed from bacterial pilin, bacteriophage, virus-like particle or viral capsid particle. By bringiag an antigen into a quasi-crystalline "virus-like" structure, th? invention exploits the strong antiviral immuna-reaction of a host for the pioducdcsi of a Mghly efficient immune response, f.e., a vaccination, against the displayed andgen.<br>
fci yet anotiier embodiment, the aigen may be selected from the group consisting of: (1) a protein suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (2) a protein suited to induce an immune response against infectious diseases; (3) a protein suited to induce an innnune response against allergens; (4) a protein suited to induce an iiiroved response against seVf-antigens; and (5) a |ffotein suited to induce an inmvune response in farm animals or pets. In another embodiment, the first attachment site and/or the second attachment site are selected from the group coicsisg". (1) a geiffitically engineered lysine residue and (2&gt; a .   genetically engineered cysteine residue, two residues that may be chemically linked together.<br><br>

The. present invention also provides a vaccine conosition conrising a phospholipase A3 protein, hi a preferred embodiment, the vaccine conqjosition of claim 31, further comprising at least one adjuvant.<br>
The iffesent invmtion also provides a method of treating an aller to bee venom, consing administering the pharmaceutical composition or the vaccine composition to a subject. As a result of such administration the. subject exhibits a decreased immune response to the venom.<br>
The invention also relates to &amp; vaccine for the prevention of prion-mediated diseases by induction of anti-lyirholoxinp, anti-lymphotoxina or anti-<br><br>
" lymphotoxinP-receptoT antibodies. The vaccine contains protein carries foreign to the immunized human or animal coupled to lymphotoxinP or fragments thefeof, iymphotoxina or fragments thereof or the lymphotoxinp receptor or fragments thereof The vaccine is injected in humans or animals in order to induce antibodies specific for endogenous lymphotoxinP, Iymphotoxina or lymphotoxinp receptor. These induced anti-lymphotoxinp, Iymphotoxina or anti-lymphotoxinp receptor antibodies reduce or eliminate the pool of follicular dendritic cells present in lymphoid organs. Since prion-replication in lymphoid organs and transport to the central nervous system are impaired in the absence of follicular dendritic cells, this treatment inhibits progression of prion-mediated disease. In addition, blocking lymphotoxinp is beneficial for patients with autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I.<br>

DETAILED DESdUFTION OF THE INVENTION 1.        Definitions<br>
Alphavirus: As used herein, the tenn "alphavirus" refers to any of the RNA viruses included within the genus Alphavirus. Descriptions of the members of this genus are contained in Strauss and Strauss, Microbiol. Rev., 58:491-562 (1994). Examples of alphaviruses inciude Aura virus, Bebaru virus, Cabassou \im&amp;, Chikungunya virus, Easter equine encephalomyelitis virus. Fort morgan virus, Getah virus, Kyzylagach virus, Mayoaro virus, Middleburg vims, Mucambo virus, Ndumu virus, Pixuna virus, Tonate virus, Triniti virus, Una virus, Westem equine encephalomyelitis virus, Whataroa virus, Sindbis virus (SJN), Semliki forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEE), and Ross River virus.<br>
Antigen: As used herein, the tenn "antigen" is a molecule capable of being bound by an antibody. An antigen is additionally capable of inducing a humoral immune response and/or cellular immune response leading to the production of B-and/or T-lymphocytes. An antigen may have one or more epitopes (B- and T-epitoes). The specific reaction refened to above is meant to indicate that the antigen will react, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding antibody and not with the multitude of other antibodies which may be evoked by other antigens.<br>
Antigenic detenninant: As used herein, the terra" antigenic determinant" is meant to refer to that portion of an antigen that is specifically recognized by either B-or T-Iymphocytes. B-lymphocytes respond to foreign antigenic determinants via antibody production, whereas T-lymphocytes are die mediator of cellular immunity. Thus, antigenic determinants or epitopes are those parts of an antigen that are recognized by antibodies, or in the context of an MHC, by T-cell receptors.<br><br>
Association; As used herein, the term "association" as it applies to the first and second attachment sites, refers to at least one non-peptide bond. The nature of the association may be covalent ionic, hydrophobic, polar or any combinatioa thereof.<br>
Attachment Site, First: As used herein, the phrase "first attachment site" refers to an element of the "organizer", itself bound to the core particle in a non-random fashion, to which the second attachment site located on the antigen or antigenic determinant may associate. Tlie first attachment site may be a protein, a polypeptide, an amino acid, a peptide, a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenylmethylsulfonylfluonde), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. Multiple first attachment sites are present on the surface of the non-natural molecular scaffold in a repetitive configuration.<br>
Attachment Site, Second; As used harein, the phrase "second attachment site" refers to an element associated with the antigen or antigenic determinant to which the first attachment site of the "organizer" .located on the surface of the non-natural molecular scaffold may associate. The second attachment site of the antigen or antigenic determinant may be a protein, a polypeptide, a peptide, a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenylmelhylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. At least one second attachment site is present on the antigen or antigenic determinant. The term "antigen or antigenic determinant with at least one second attachment site" refers, therefore, to an antigen or antigenic construct comprising at least the antigen or antigenic detenninant and the second attachment site. However, in particular for a second attachment site, which is not naturally occurring within the antigen or antigenic determinant, these antigen or antigenic constructs comprise an "amino acid linker". Such an amino acid linker, or also just termed "linker" within this specification, either associates the antigen or antigenic detenninant with the second attachment site, or more prefrably, already comprises or contains the second attachment site, typically -but not necessarily - as one amino acid residue, preferably as a cysteine residue. The term "amino acid linker" as used herein, however, does not intend to imply that such an amino acid linker consists exclusively of amino acid residues, even if an amino acid linker consisting of amino acid residues is a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The amino acid residues of the amino acid linker is, preferably, composed of naturally occuring amino acids or unnatural amino acids known in the art, all-L or ali-D or mixtures thereof. However, an amino add linker comprising a molecule with a sulfhydryl group or cysteine residue is also encompassed within the invention. Such a molecule comprise preferably a C1-C6 alkyl-, cycloalkyl (C5,C6), aryl or heteroaryl moiety. Association between the antigen or antigenic determinant or optionally the<br><br>
second attachment site and the amino acid linker is preferably by way of at least one cQvalent bond, more preferably by way of at least one peptide bond.<br>
Bound: As used herein, the term "bound" refers to binding or attachment that may be covalent, e.g., by chemically coupling, or non-covalent, e.g., ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, etc. Covalent bonds can be, for example, ester, ether, phosphoester, amide, peptide, imide, carbon-sulfur bonds, caibon-phosphorus bonds, and the like. The term "bound" is broader than and includes tenns such as "coiqiled," "fused" and "attached".<br>
Core particle: As used herein, the term "core particle" refers to a rigid structure with an inherent repetitive organization that provides a foundation for attachment of an "organizer". A core particle as used herein may be the product of a synthetic process or the product of a biological process.<br>
Coat protein(s): As used herein, the term "coat protein(s)" refers to the protein(s) of a bacteriophage or a RNA-phage capable of being incorporated within the capsid assembly of the bacteriophage or the RNA-phage. However, when refening to the specific gene product of the coat protein gene of RNA-phages the term "CP" is used. For example, the specific gene product of the coat protein gene of RNA-phage QP is referred to as "Qp CP", whereas the "coat proteins" of bacteriophage Qb comprise the "Qp CP" as well as the Al protein.<br>
Cw-acting: As used herein, the phrase "cis-acting" sequence refers to nucleic acid sequences to which a replicase binds to catalyze the RNA-dependent replication of KNA molecules. These replication events result in the replication of the full-length and partial RNA molecules and, thus, the aJpahvirus subgenomic promoter is also a "cw-acting" sequence. Cw-acting sequences may be located at or near the 5" end, 3" end, or both ends of a nucleic acid molecule, as well as internally.<br>
Fusion: As used herein, the term "fusion" refers to the combination of amino acid sequences of different origin in one polypeptide chain by in-frame combination of their coding nucleotide sequences. The term "fusion" explicitly encompasses internal fusions, i.e., insertion of sequences of different,origin within a polypeptide chain, in addition to fusion to 6m of its tennini-<br>
Hetefologous sequence: As used herein, the term "heterologous sequence" refers to a second nucleotide sequence present in a vector of the invention. The term "heterologous sequence" also refers to any amino acid or RNA sequence encoded by a heterologous DNA sequence contained in a vector of the invention. Heterologous nucleotide sequences can encode proteins or RNA molecules normally expressed in the cell type in which they are present or molecules not normally expressed therein (e.g., Sindbis structural proteins).<br><br>
Isolated: As used herein, when the term "isolated" is used in reference to a molecule, the term means that the molecule has been removed ftom its native environment. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptiite naturally present in a living animal is not "isolated," but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is "isolated" Further, recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA replication products of DNA and RNA molecules. Isolated nucleic acid molecules further include synthetically produced molecules. Additionally, vector molecules contained in recombinant host cells are also isolated. Thus, not all "isolated" molecules need be "purified."<br>
Immunotherjeutic; As used herein, the term "immunotherapeutic" is a composition for the treatment of diseases or disorders. More specifically, the term is used to refer to a method of treatment for allergies or a method of treatment for cancer.<br>
Individial: As used herein, the term "individual" refers to multicellular oianisms and includes both plants and animals. Preferred multicellular organisms are animals, more preferred are vertebrates, even more preferred are mammals, and most preferred are humans.<br>
Low or undetectable: As used herein, the phrase "low or undetectable," when used in reference to gene expression level, refers to a level of expression which is either significanfly lower than that seen when the gene is maximally induced (e.g., at least five fold lower) or is not readily detectable by the methods used in the following examples section.<br>
Lectin: As used herein, proteins obtained particularly fnim the seeds of leguminous plants, but also from many other plant and animal sources, that have binding sites for specific mono- or oligosaccharides. Examples include concanavalin A and wheat-germ agglutinin, wlucii are widely used as analytical and preparative agents in the study of glycoprotdn.<br>
Mimotppe: As used herein, the term"niimotope" refers to a substance which induces an immune response to an antigen or antigeruc determinant Generally, the tam mimotope will be used with reference to a particular antigen. For example, a peptide which elicits the production of antibodies to a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a mimotope of the antigenic detertoinant to which the antibodies bind. A mimotope may or may not have substantial stmctural similarity to or share structural properties with an antigen or antigenic determinant to which it induces an immune response. Methods for generating and identifying mimotopes which induce immune responses to particular antigens or antigenic determinants are known in the art and are described elsewhere herein.<br><br>
Natural origin: As used herein, the term "natural origin" means that the whole or parts thereof are not synthetic and exist or are produced in nature.<br>
Non-natural; As used herein, the term generally means not from nature, more specifically, the term means fttim the hand of man.<br>
Non-natural origin: As used herein, the tenn "non-natural origin" generally means synthetic or not from nature; more specifically, the term means from the hand of man.<br>
Non-natural molecular scaffold: As used herein, the phrase "non-natural molecular scaffold" refers to any product made by the hand of man that may serve to provide a rid and repetitive array of first attachment sites. Ideally but not necessarily, these first attachment sites are in a geometric order. "Hie non-natural molecular scaffold may be organic or non-organic and may be synthesized chemically or through a biological process, in part or in whole. The non-natural molecular scaffold is comprised of: (a) a core particle, either of natural or non-natural origin; and (b) an otganiiei, which itself comprises at least one first attachment site and is connected to a core particle by at least one covalent bond. In a particular embodiment, the non-natural molecular scaffold may be a virus, virus-like particle, a bacterial pilus, a virus capsid particle, a phage, a recombinant form thereof, or synthetic particle.<br>
Ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array. As used heran, the term "ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array" generally refers to a repeating pattern of antigen or antigenic determinant, characterized by a uniform spacial arrangement of the antigens or antigenic determinants with respect to the non-natural molecular scaffold. In one embodiment of the invention, the repeating pattern may be a geometric pattem. Examples of smtable ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays are those which possess strictiy repetitive paracrystalline orders of antigens or antigenic deteiminants with spacings of 5 to 15 nanometers.<br>
Organizer As used herein, the term "organizer" is used to refer to an element bound to a core particle in a non-raridom fashion that provides a nucleation site for creating an ordered and repetitive antigen array. An organizer is any element comprising at least one first attachment site that is bound to a core particle by at leat one covalent bond. An organizer may be a protein, a polypeptide, a peptide, an amino acid (i.e., a residue of a protein, a polypeptide or peptide), a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. Therefore, the organizer further ensures fonnation of an ordered and repetitive antigen array in<br><br>
accordance with the present invention. In typical embodiments of the invention, the core particle is modified, e.g. by way of genetic engineering or chemical reaction, so as to generate a non-naural molecular scaffold comprising tiie core particle and the oianizer, the latter being connected to the core particle by at least one covalent bond. In certain embodiments of the invention, however, the organizer is selected as being part of the core particle. Therefore, for those embodiments modification of the core particle is not necessarily needed to generate a non-natural molecular scaffold comprising the core particle and the organizer and to ensure the formation of an ordered and repetitive antigen array.<br>
Permissive temperature: As used herein, the phrase "permissive temperature" refers to temperatures at which an enzyme has relatively high levels of catalytic activity.<br>
Pili: As used herein, the term "piU" (singular being "pilus") refers to extracellular structures of bacterial cells composed of protein monomers (e.g., pilin monomers) which are organized into ordered and repetitive patterns. Further, pili are structures which are involved in processes such as the attachment of bacterial cells to host cell surface receptors, inter-cellular genetic exchanges, and cell-cell recognition. Examples of piU include Type-1 pili, P-piU, FlC pili, S-pili, and 987P-pih. Additional examples of pili are set out below.<br>
Pilus-like structure: As used herein, the phrase "pilus-like structure" refers to structures having characteristics similar to tiiat of pili and composed of protein monomers. One example of a "pilus-like structure" is a structure formed by a bactCTiai ceil which expresses modified pilin proteins that do not form ordered and repetitive arrays that are essentially identical to those of natural pih.<br>
Polypeptide; As used herein the term "polypeptide" refers to a polymer composed of amino acid residues, generally natural amino acid residues, linked together throu peptide bonds. Although a polypeptide may not necessarily be limited in size, the tgm polypeptide is often used in conjunction with peptide of a size of aboiit ten to about 50 amino acids.<br>
Protein: As used herein, the term protein refers to a polypeptide generally of a size of above 20, more particularly of above 50 amino acid residues. Proteins generally have a defined three dimensional structure although they do not necessarily need to, and are often referred to as folded, in opposition to peptides and polypeptides which often do not possess a defined three-dimensional structure, but rather can adopt a large number of different conformations, and are referred to as unfolded. The defined three-dimensional structures of proteins is especially important for the association between the core particle and the antigen, mediated by the second<br><br>
attachment site, and in particular by way of chemical cross-linking between the first and second attachment site using a chemical cross-linker. The amino acid linker is also intimately related to the structural properties of proteins in some aspects of the invention.<br>
Purified: As used herein, when the term "purified" is used in reference to a molecule, it means that the concentration of the molecule being purified has been increased relative to molecules associated with it in its natural environment. Naturally associated molecules include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and sugars but generally do not include water, buffers, and reagents added to maintain the integrity or facilitate the purification of the molecule being purified. For example, even if mRNA is diluted with an aqueous solvent during oiigo dT column chromatography, mRNA molecules are purified by this chromatogrhy if naturally associated nucleic acids and other biological molecules do not bind to the column and are separated from the subject mRNA molecules.<br>
Receptor; As used herein, the term "receptor" refers to proteins or glycoproteins or fragments thereof capable of interacting with another molecule, called die ligand. The ligand may belong to any class of biochemical or chemical compounds. The receptor need not necessarily be a membrane-bound protein. Soluble protein, like e.g., maltose binding protein or retinol binding protein are receptors as well.<br>
Residue: As used herein, the term "residue" is meant to mean a specific amino acid in a polypeptide backbone or side chain.<br>
Recombinant host cell: As used herein, the term "recombinant host cell" refers to a host cell into which one ore more nucleic acid molecules of the invention have been introduced.<br>
Recombinant virus: As used herein, the phrase "recombinant virus" refers to a virus that is netically modified by the hand of man. The phrase covers any virus known in the art More specifically, the phrase refers to a"an alphavirus genetically modified by the hand of man, and most specifically, the phrase refers to a Sinbis virus genetically modified by the hand of man.<br>
Restrictive temperature: As used herein, the phrase "restrictive temperature" refers to temperatures at which an enzyme has low or undetectable levels of catalytic activity. Both "hot" and "cold" sensitive mutants are known and, thus, a restrictive temperature may be higher or lower than a permissive temperature.<br>
RNA-dependent RNA replication event: As used herein, the phrase "RNA-dependent RNA replication event" refers to processes which result in the fonnation of an RNA molecule using an RNA molecule as a template.<br><br>
f	RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase:  AS usea nerem, me phrase "KNA-<br>
Dependent RNA polymerase" refers to a polymerase which catalyzes the production<br>
of an RNA molecule from another RNA molecule.    This tenn is used herein<br>
synonymously with the term "replicase."<br>
RNA-phage: As used herein, the term "RNA-phage" refers to RNA viruses<br>
infecting bacteria, preferably to single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses infecting<br>
bacteria.<br>
Self antigen : As used herein, the tern "self antigen" refers to proteins encoded<br>
by the host"s DNA and products generated by proteins or RNA encoded by the host"s<br>
DNA are defined as self. In addition, proteins that result from a combination of two or<br>
several sdf-molecules or that represent a fraction of a self-molecule and proteins that<br>
have a high homology two self-molecules as defined above (&gt;95%)may also be<br>
considered self.<br>

2.        Compositions  of Ordered  and  Repetitive  Antigen  or  Antigenic Determinant Arrays and Methods to Make the Same<br>
The disclosed invention provides compositions comprising an ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array. Furthermore, the invention conveniently enables the practitioner to construct ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays for various treatment purposes, which includes the prevention of infectious diseases, the treatment of allergies and the treatment of cancers.<br>
Compositions of the invention essentially comprise, or alternatively consist of, two elements: (1) a non-natural molecular scaffold; and (2) an antigen or antigenic determinant with at least, one second attachment site capable" of association through at least one non-peptide bond to said first attachment site.<br>
Compositions of the invention also comprise, or altematively consist of, bacterial pilus proteins to which antigens or antigenic determinants are directiy linked.<br>
The non-natural molecular scaffold comprises, or altematively consists of: (a) a core particle selected from the group consisting of (1) a core particle of non-natural origin and (2) a core particle of natural origin; and (b) an organizer comprising at<br><br>
least one firat attachment site, wherein said organizer is connected to said core particle by at least one covalent bond.<br>
Compositions of the invention also comprise, or alternatively consist of, core particles to which antigens or antigenic detramiiiants are directly linked.<br>
The antigen or antigenic determinant has at least one second attachment site which is selected from the group consisting of (a) an attachment site not naturally occurring with said antigen or antigenic determinant; and (b) an attachment site naturally occurring with said antigen or antigenic determinant<br>

"Dius, the antigen or antigenic detenninant and the non-natural molecular scaffold are brought togettier through this association of the first and the second attachment site to form an ordered and r&gt;etitive antigen array.<br>
The practioner may specifically design the antigen OT antigenic determinant and the second attachment site such that the arrangement of all the antigens or antigenic determinants bound to the non-natural molecular scaffold or, in certain eaibodiments, the core particle will be uniform. For example, one may place a single second attachment site on the antigen or antigenic determinant at the carboxyl or amino terminus, thereby ensuring through design that all antigen or antigenic determinant molecules that are attached to the non-natural molecular scaffold are positioned in a uniform way. Thus, the invention provides a convenient means of placing any antigen or antigenic detenninant onto a non-natural molecular scaffold in a defined order and in a maimer which forms a repetitive pattern.<br>
As will be clear to those skilled in the art, certain embodiments of the invention involve the use of recombinant nucleic acid technologies such as cloning, polymerase chain reaction, the purification of DNA and RNA, the expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic ceDs, etc. Such methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art and may be conveniently found in published laboratory methods manuals (e.g., Sambrook,.

also adequately described in the literature, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A.       Core Particles and Non-Natural Molecular Scaffolds<br>
One element in certain compositions of the invention is a non-natural molecular scaffold comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a core particle and an organizer. As used herein, the phrase "non-natural molecular scaffold" refers to any product made by the hand of man that may serve to provide a rigid and repetitive array of first attachment sites. More specifically, the non-natural molecular scaffold comprises, or alternatively consists of, (a) a core particle selected from the group consisting of (1) a core particle of non-natural origin and (2) a core particle of natural origin; and (b) an organizer comprising at least one first attachment site, wherein said organizer is connected to said core particle by at least one covalent bond<br>
As will be readily apparent to diose skilled in the art, the core particle of the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention is not limited to any specific form. The core particle may be organic or non-organic and may be synthesized chemically or through a biological process.<br>
In one embodiment, a non-natural core particle may be a synthetic polymer, a lipid micelle or a metal. Such core particles are ioiown in the art, providing a basis from which to build the novel non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention. By ■way of example, synthetic polymer or metal core particles are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,770,380, which discloses the use of a calixarene organic scaffold to which is attached a plurality of peptide loops in the creation of an "antibody mimic", and U.S. Patent No. 5,334,394 describes nanocrystalline particles used as a viral decoy that are composed of a wide variety of inorganic materials, including metals or ceramics. Suitable metals include chromium, rubidium, iron, zinc, selenium, nickel, gold, silver, platinum. Suitable ceramic materials in this embodiment include silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, aluminum oxide, ruthenium oxide and tin oxide. The core particles of this embodiment may be made from organic materials including carbon (diamond). Suitable polymers include polystyrene, nylon and nitrocellulose. Fortius type of nanocrystalline particle, particles made fix)m tin oxide, titanium dioxide or carbon (diamond) are may also be used. A lipid micelle may be prepared by any means known in the art For example micelles may be prepared according to the procedure of Baiselle and Millar (Biophys. Chem. 4:355-361 (1975)) or Corti et al. iChem. Phys. Lipids 55:197-214 (1981)) or Lopez et al {FEES Utt. -25:314-318 (1998)) or Topchieva and Karezin (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 213:29-35 (1999)) or<br><br>
Morein et ol., {Nature 503:457-460 (1984)), which are all incorporated lierein by reference.<br>
TTie core particle may also be produced through a biological process, which may be natural or non-natural. By way of example, this type of embodiment may includes a core particle comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a vims, vims-like particle, a bacterial pUus, a phage, a viral capsid particfe or a recombinant form thereof. In a more specific embodiment, the core particle may comprise, or alternatively consist of, recombinant proteins of Rotavirus, recombinant proteins of Norwalk virus, recombinant proteins of Alphavims, recombinant proteins which form bacterial pili or pilus-Uke structures, recombinant proteins of Foot and Mouth Disease vims, recombinant proteins of Retrovims, recombinant proteins of Hepatitis B virus (e.g., a HBcAg), recombinant proteins of Tobacco mosaic virus, recombinant proteins of Flock House Virus, and recombinant proteins of human Papillomavirus. The core particle may further comprise, or alternatively consist of, one or more fragments of such proteins, as well as variants of such proteins which retain the ability to associate with each other to fona ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays.<br>
As explained in more below, variants of proteins which retain the ability to associate witti each other to fonn ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic detemainant arrays may share, for example, at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identity at the amino acid level with their wild-type countMpaits. Using the HBcAg having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:89 for illustration, the invention includes vaccine compositions comprising HBcAg polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID N0:S9, and forms of this protein which have been processed, where appropriate, to remove N-terminal leader sequence. These variants will generally be capable of associating to form dimeric or multimeric stmctures. Methods which can be used to" determine whether proteins form such structures comprise gel filtration, agarose-gel electrophoresis, sucrose gradient centrifugation and electron microscopy (e.g., Koschel, M. et ai, J. Virol 73:2153-2160 (1999)).<br>
Fragments of proteins which retain the ability to associate with each other to form ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic detenninant arrays may comprise, or altCTnatively consist of, polypeptides which are 15,20,25, 30, 35,40,45, 50, 55,60, 65, 70, 75, 80. 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180. 190, or 200 amino acids in length. Examples of such protein fragments include fragments of proteins discussed herein which are suitable for the preparation of core particles and/or non-natural molecular scaffolds."<br><br>
/	Whether natural or non-natural, the core particle of the invention will<br>
generally have an organizer that is attached to the natural or non-natural core particle by at least one covalent bond. The organizer is an element bound to a core particle in a non-random fashion that provides a nucleation site for creating an ordered and repetitive antigen array. Ideally, but not necessarily, the organizer is associated with the core particle in a geometric order. Minimally, the organizer comprises a first attachment site.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the ordered and repetitive array is fomied by association between (1) either core particles or non-natural molecular scaffolds and (2) either (a) an antigen or antigenic determinant or (b) one or more antigens or antigenic determinants. For example, bacterial pili or pilus-like structures are fonned from proteins which are organized into ordered and repetitive structures. Thus, in many instances, it will be possible to form ordered arrays of antigens or antigenic determinants by linking these constituents to bacterial pili or pilus-like structures either directly or through an organizer.<br>
As previously stated, the organizer may be any element comprising at least one first attachment site that is bound to a core particle by at least one covalent bond. An organizer may be a protein, a polypeptide, a peptide, an amino acid (i.e., a residue of a protein, a polypeptide or peptide), a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound OiotJn, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. Iti a more specific embodiment, the organizer may comprise a first attachment site comprising an antigen, an antibody or antibody fragment, biotin, avidin, strepavidin, a receptor, a receptor ligand, a Ugand, a ligand-ttniBng protean, an inter;ting leucine apper polypeptide, an amino group, a chemical group reactive to an amino group; a carboxyl group, chemical group reactive to a carboxyl group, a sulfliydryl group, a chemical group reactive to a sulfhydryl group, or a combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the core particle of the non-natural molecular scaffold comprises a virus, a bacterial pilus, a stmcture fonned finm bacterial pilin, a bacteriophage, a_ virus-like particle, a viral capsid particle or a recombinant form thereof. Any vims known in the art having an ordered and repetitive coat and/or core protein structure may be selected as a non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention; examples of suitable viruses include sindbis and other alpfaaviruses, riiabdoviruses (e.g. vesicular stomatitis virus), picomaviruses (e.g., hixman rliino virus, Aichi virus), togaviruses (e.g., rubella virus), orthomyxoviruses (e.g., Thogoto virus, Balken virus, . fowl plague virus), polyomaviruses {e.g., polyomavirus BK, polyomavirus JC, avian polyomavirus BEDV), parvoviruses, rotaviruses, bacteriophage QP, bacteriophage R17, bacteriophage Mil, bacteriophage MXl, bacteriophage NL95, bacteriophage fr.<br><br>
bacteriophage GA, bacteriophage SP, bacteriophage MS2, bacteriophage f2, bacteriophage PP7, Nonvalk virus, foot and mouth disease virus, a retrovirus. Hepatitis B virus. Tobacco mosaic virus, Flock House Virus, and human Papilomavirus (for example, see Table 1 in Bachman, M.F. and Zinkemagel, R.M., Immunol. Today i7:553-558 (1996)).<br><br> one embodiment, the invention utilizes genetic engineering of a virus to create a fusion between an ordered and repetitive viral envelope protein and an organizer comprising a heterologous protein, peptide, antigenic determinant or a reactive amino acid residue of choice. Other genetic manipulations known to those in the art may be included in the construction of the non-natural molecular scaffold; for example, it may be desirle to restrict the replication abUity of the recombinant virus through genetic mutation. The viral protein selected for fusion to the organizer (i.e., first attachment site) protein should have an organized and repetitive structure. Such an organized and repetitive structure include paracrystalline organizations with a spring of 5-15 nm on the surface of the virus. The creatjon of this type of fusion protein will result in multiple, ordered and repetitive organizers on the surface of the virus. Thus, the ordered and repetitive organization of the first attachment sites resulting therefiitim will reflect the normal organization of the native viral protein.<br>
As will be discussed in more detail herein, in another embodiment of the invention, the non-natural molecular scaffold is a recombinant alphavirus, and more specifically, a recombinant Sinbis virus. Alphaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses that replicate their genomic RNA entirely in the cytoplasm of the infected cell and witiiout a DNA intennediate (Strauss, J. and Strauss, E., Microbiol. Rev. 55:491-562 (1994)). Several members of the alphavirus family, Sindbis (Xiong, C. et al.. Science243:\\2,i"ll9\ (1989); Schlesinger, S., TrendsBiotechnol 77:18-22 (1993)), SemEM Forest Virus (SFV) (Liijestrem, P. &amp; Garoff, H., Bio/Technology 9:1356-1361 (1991)) and others (Davis, N.L. et al.. Virology 777:189-204 (1989)), have received considerable attention for use as virus-based expression vectors for a variety of different protgns (Lundstrom, K., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. S:578-582 (1997); liijestrom. P., .Curr". Opin. Biotechnol. 5:495-500 (1994»"and as candidates for vaccine development Recently, a number of patents have issued directed to the use of alphaviruses for the expression of hetwologous proteins and the development of vaccines {see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,766,602; 5,792,462; 5,739,026; 5.789,245 and 5,814,482). Te construction of the aiphaviral scaffold of the invention may be done by means generally known in the art of recombinant DNA technology, as described by the aforementioned articles, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A variety of diffwent recombinant host cells can be utilized to produce a viral-based core particle for antigen or antigenic determinant attachment.   For example,<br><br>
Aipnavmises are Known to have a wide host range; Sindbis virus infects cultured niainmalian, reptilian, and amphibian cells, as well as some insect cells (Clark, H., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 57:645 (1973); Uake, C, /. Gen. Virol. 35:3Z5 (1977); StoUar, V. in THE TOGAVIRUSES, R.W. Schlesinger, Ed., Academic Press, (1980), pp.583"62I). Thus, numerous recombinant host cells can be used in the practice of the invention. BHK, COS, Vero, HeLa and CHO cells are particularly suitable for the production of heterologous proteins because they have the potential to glycosylate heterologous proteins in a manner similar to human cells (Watson, E. et al., Glycobiology 4:221, (1994)) and can be selected (Zang, M. et al., Bio/Technology ]3:389 (1995)) or genetically engineered (Renner W. et al., Biotech. Bioeng. 4:416 (1995); Lee K. et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 50:336 (1996)) to grow in serum-free medium, as well as in suspension.<br>
Introduction of the polynucleotide vectors into host cells can be effected by methods described in standard laboratory manuals {see, e.g., Sambrook, J. et al, eds.. MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd. edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). Chapter 9; Ausubel, E et al, eds., CuERHT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John H. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1997), Chapter 16), including methods such as electroporation, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, transfection, microinjection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, transduction, scrape loading, ballistic introduction, and infection. Methods for the introduction of exogenous DNA sequences into host cells are discussed in Feigner, P. et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,580,859.<br>
Packaged RNA sequences can also be used to infect host cells. These packaged RNA sequences can be introduced to host cells by adding them to the culture meiMum. For example, tiie preparation of non-infective alpahviial paiticles is described in a number of sources, including "Sindbis Expression System", Version C ilnvitrogen Catalog No, K750-1).<br>
When mammalian cells are used as recombinant host cells for the production of viral-based core particles, these cells will generally be grown in tissue culture. Methods for growing cells iri culture are well known in the art {see, e.g., Celis, J., ed.. CELL BIOLOGY, Academic Press, 2° edition, (1998); Sambrook, J. et al., eds.. MOLECULAR CLONiNa, A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd. edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989); Ausubel, F. et al., eds., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John H. Wiley &amp; Sons, Lie. (1997); Freshney, R., CULTURE OF ANIMAL CELLS, Alan R. Uss, Inc. (1983)).<br>
As will be understood by those in the art, the first attachment site may be or be a part of any suitable protain, polypeptide, sugar, polynucleotide, peptide (amino acid), natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or combination thereof<br><br>
that may serve to specifically attach the antigen or antigenic determinant of choice to the non-natural molecular scaffold. In one embodiment, the attachment site is a protein or peptide that may be selected from those known in the art For example, the first attachment site may selected from the following group: a Hgand, a receptor, a lectin, avidin, streptavidin, biotin, an epitope such as an HA or T7 tag, Myc, Max, immunoglobulin domains and any other amino acid sequence known in the art that would be usefiil as a first attachment site.<br>
It should be further understood by those in the art that with another embodiment of the invention, the first attachment site may be created secondarily to the orgamzer (Le., protein or polypeptide) utilized in constructing the iu-frame fusion to the capsid protein. For example, a protein may be utilized for fusion to the envelope protein with an amino add sequence known to be glycosylated in a specific fashion, and the sugar moiety added as a result may then serve at the first attachment site of the viral scaffold by way of binding to a lectin swng as the secondary attachment site of an antigen. Alternatively, the oiganizw sequence may be biotinylated in vivo and the biotin moiety may serve as the first attachment site of the invention, or the organizer sequence may be subjected to chemical modification of distinct amino acid residues in vitro, the modification serving as the first attachment te.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the first attachment site is selected to be the JUN-FOS leucine zipper protein domain that is fused in fime to the Hepatitis B csid (core) protein (HBcAg). However, it will be clear to all individuals in the art that other viral capsid proteins may be utilized in the fusion protein constmct for locating the first attachment site in the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention.<br>
Bi another embodiment of the invention, the first attachment site is selected to be a lysine or cysteine residue tiiat is fused in frame to the HBcAg. However, it will be clear to all individuals in the art that other viral capsid or virus-like particles may be utilized in the fusion protein construet. for locating the first attachment in the non-natinral roolKiular scaffold of the invention.<br>
The JUN amino acid sequence utilized for the first attachment site is the following:<br>
CGGIUARIJEEKVKTLKAQNSELASTANMLREQVAQLKQKVMNHVGC<br>
(SEQ ID NO:59)<br>
In this instance, the anticipated second attachment site on the antigen would<br>
be the FOS leucine zipper protein domain and the amino acid sequence would<br>
be the following:<br><br>
CGGLTDTLQAETDQVEDEKSALQTEIANIJJCBKEKLEFILAAHGGC (SEQ ID NO:60)<br>
These sequences are derived from the transcription factors JVN and FOS, each flanked with a short sequence containing a cysteine residue on both sides. TTiese sequences are known to interact with each other. The oiigina] hypothetical structure proposed for the JUN-FOS dimer assumed that the hydrophobic side chains of one monomer interdigjtate with the respective ade chmns of the other monomer in a zippra--like manner (Landschulz et al, Science 24(?;1759-1764 (1988)). However, this hypothesis proved to be wrong, and these proteins are known to form an a-helical coiied coil (O"Shea et al., Science 2-3:538-542 (1989); O"Shea et al., Cell (5S:699-708 (1992); Cohen &amp; Parry, Trends Biochem. Set. 7i:245-248 (1986)). Thus, the term "leucine zipper" is frequently used to refer to these protein domains for more historical than stmctural reasons. Throughout this patent, the term "leucine zipper" is \Ked to refer to the sequences depicted above or sequences essentially similar to the ones depicted above. Tlie terms JUN and FOS are used for the respective leucine zipper domains rathH" than the entire JUN and FOS proteins.<br>
As previously stated, the invention includes viral-based core particles which comprise, or alternatively consist of, a virus, virus-like particle, a phage, a viral csid particle or a recombinant form thereof. Skilled artisans have the knowledge to produce such core particle and attach organizers thereto. The production of Hepatitis B virus-like particles and measles viral capsid particles as core particles is disclosed in Examples 17 to 22 of WO 00/32227, which is explicitly incorporated by reference. In such embodiments, the JUN leucine zipper protein domain or FOS leucine zipper protMn domain may be used as an organizer, and hence as a first attachment site, for the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention.<br>
Examples 23-29 provide details of the production of Ifcpatitis B core particles<br>
carrying an in-frame fiised peptide with a reactive lysine residue and antigens<br>
carrying a genetically fused cysteine residue, as first and second attachmMt site.<br>
respectively.	■        .<br>
1	In other embodiments, the core particles used in compositions of the<br>
invention are composed of a Ifcpatitis B capsid (core) protein (HBcAg), a franent of a HBcAg, or other protein or peptide which can form ordered arrays, which have been modified to either eliminate or reduce the number of free cysteine residues. Zhou et al. {J. Virol. 66:5393-5398 (1992)) demonstrated that HBcAgs which have been modified to remove the naturally resident cysteine residues retain the ability to associate and form multimeric structures. Thus, core particles suitable for use in compositions of the invention include those comprising modified HBcAgs, or<br><br>
fragments thereof, in which one or more of the naturally resident cysteine residues have been either deleted or substituted with another amino add residue (e.g., a serine residue).<br>
2	The HBcAg is a protein generated by the processing of a Hepatitis B<br>
core antigen precursor protein. A number of isotypes of the HBcAg have been identified. For example, the HBcAg protein having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:132 is 183 amino acids in length and is generated by the processing of a 212 amino acid Hepatitis B core antigen precmor protein. This processing results in the removal of 29 amino acids from the N-terminus of the Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein. Similarly, the HBcAg protein having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:134 is 185 amino acids in length and is generated by the processing of a 214 amino acid Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein. The amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134, as compared to tiie amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 132, contains a two amino acid insert at positions 152 andl53inSEQIDNO:134.<br>
In most instances, vaccine compositions of the invention will be prepared using the processed form of a HBcAg (i.e., a HBcAg from which the N-tenninal leader sequence (e.g., the first 29 amino acid residues shown in SEQ ID NO:134) of the Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein have been removed).<br>
Further, when HBcAgs are produced under conditions where processing will not occur, the HBcAgs will generally be expressed in "processed" form. For example, bacterial systems, such as E. coli, generally do not remove the leader sequences, also referred to as "signal peptides," of proteins which are normally expressed in eukaryotic cells. Thus, when an E. coli expression system is used to produce HBcAgs of the invention, these proteins will generally be exprsed such that the N-terminal leader sequence of the Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein is not present.<br>
In one embodiment of the inventjon, a "tnodified HBcAg comprising the amino, acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134, or subportjon thereof, is used to prepare non-natural molecular scaffolds, hi particular, modified HB6Ags suitable for use in the practice of the invention include proteins m which one or more of the cysteine residues at positions corresponding to positions 48, 61, 107 and 185 of a protein having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:134 have been either deleted or substituted with other amino acid residues (e.g., a serine residue). As one skilled in the art would recognize, cysteine residues at similar locations in HBcAg variants having amino acids sequences which differ from that shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 could also be deleted or substituted with<br><br>
other amino acid residues. The modified HBcAg variants can then be used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
The present invention also includes HBcAg variants which have been modified to delete or substitute one or more additional cysteine residues which are not found in polypeptides having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:134. Examples of such HBcAg variants have the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs:90 and 132. These variant contain cysteines residues at a position corresponding to amino acid residue 147 in SEQ ID NO:134. Thus, the vacdne compositJOTis of the invention include compositions comimsing HBcAgs in which cysteine residues not present in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:134 have been deleted.<br>
Under certain circumstances {e.g., when a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent is used to attach antigens or antigenic determinants to the non-natural molecular scaffold), the presence of free cysteine residues in the HBcAg is believed to lead to covalent coupling of toxic components to core particles, as well as the cross-linjdng of monomers to foim undefined species.<br>
Further, in niany instances, these toxic components may not be detectable with assays performed on compositions of fee invention. This is so because covalent coupling of toxic components to the non-natural molecular scaffold would result in the formation of a population of diverse species in which toxic components are linked to different cysteine residues, or in some cases no cysteine residues, of the HBcAgs. In other words, each free cysteine residue of each HBcAg will not be covalently linked to toxic components. Further, in many instances, none of the cysteine residues of particular HBcAgs will be linked to toxic components. TTius, the presence of these toxic conwnents may be difficult to detect because they would be present in a mixed population of molecules. Hie administration to an individual of HBcAg species containing toxic components, however, could lead to a potentially serious adverse reaction.<br>
:,	It is well known in the art that free cysteine residues can be involved in<br>
a numbw of chemical sitie reactions. These side reactions include disulfide exchanges, reaction with chemical substances or metabolites that are, for example, injected or formed in a combination therapy with other substances, or direct oxidation and reaction with nucleotides upon exposure to UV light Toxic adducts could thus be generated, especially considering the fact that HBcAgs have a strong tendency to bind nucleic acids. Detection of such toxic products in antigen-capsid conjugates would be difficult using capsids prepared using HBcAgs containing free cysteines and heterobifunctional cross-linkers, since a distribution of products with a broad range of molecular weight would be<br><br>
generated. The toxic adducts would thus be distributed between a multiplicity of species, which individually niay each be present at low concentration, but reach toxic levels when together.<br>
bi view of the above, one advantage to the use of HBcAgs in vaccine compositions which have been modified to remove naturally resident cysteine residuM is that sites to which toxic species can bind when antigens or antigenic determinants are attached to the non-natural molecular scaffold would be reduced in number or eliminated altogefeer. Further, a high concentration of cross-linko: can be used to produce highly decorated particles without the drawback of generating a plurality of undefined cross-linked species of HBcAg monomers (i.e., a diverse mixture of cross-linked monomeric HbcAgs).<br>
A number of naturally occumng HBcAg variants suitable for use in the practice of the present invention have been identified. Yuan et cU., (J. Virol. Z?;10122-10128 (1999)), for example, describe variants in which the isoleucine residue at position corresponding to position 97 in SEQ ID NO:134 is replaced with either a leucine residue or a phenylalanine residue. The amino acid sequences of a number of HBcAg variants, as well as several Hepatitis B core antigen precursor variants, are disclosed in GenBank reports AAF121240 (SEQ ID NO:89), AF121239 (SEQ ID NO:90), X85297 (SEQ ID NO:91), X02496 (SEQ ID NO:92), X85305 (SEQ ID NO:93), X85303 (SEQ ID NO:94), AF151735 (SEQ ID NO:95), X85259 (SEQ ID NO:96), X85286 (SEQ ID NO:97), X85260 (SEQ ID NO:98), X85317 (SEQ ID NO:99), X85298 (SEQ ID NO; 100), AF043593 (SEQ ID NO: 101), M20706 (SEQ ID NO: 102), X85295 (SEQ ID NO; 103), X80925 (SEQ ID NO: 104), X85284 (SEQ ID NO: 105), X85275 (SEQ ID NO:106), X72702 (SEQ ID NO;107), X85291 (SEQ ID NO;108), X65258 (SEQ ID N0:109), X85302 (SEQ ID NO:110), M32138 (SEQ ID N0:111), X85293 (SEQ ID N0:112), X85315 (SEQ © NO:113), U95551 (SEQ ID N0:114), X85256 (SEQ ID N0:n5), X85316 (SEQ ID N0:116), X85296 (SEQ ID N0:117), AB033559 (SEQ ID" 110:118), X59795 (SEQ ID N0;119), X85299 (SEQ ED NOfl20&gt;. X85367 (SEQ ID N0;121), X65257 (SEQ ID N0:122). X85311 (SEQ ID NO:123), X85301 (SEQ ID N0:124), X85314 (SEQ ID NO;X25), X85287 (SEQ ID NO:126). X85272 (SEQ ID NO:127), X85319 (SEQ ID NO: 128), AB010289 (SEQ ID NO: 129), X85285 (SEQ ID NO;130), AB010289 (SEQ ID N0:131), AF121242 (SEQ ID NO;132), M9052p (SEQ ID NO:135), P03153 (SEQ ID NO:136), AF110999 (SEQ ID NO:137), and M95589 (SEQ ID NO:138), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. These HBcAg variants differ in amino acid sequence at a number of positions, including amino acid residues which corresponds to the<br><br>
ammo acid resiaues located at positions 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 29, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 49, 51, 57. 58, 59, 64, 66, 67, 69, 74, 77, 80, 81, 87, 92, 93, 97, 98, 100, 103, 105, 106, 109, 113, 116, 121, 126, 130, 133, 135, 141, 147, 149, 157, 176.178,182 and 183 in SEQ ID NO:134.<br>
HBcAgs suitable for use in the present invention nay be derived from any organism so long as they are able to associate to form an ordered and repetitive antigen array.<br>
As noted above, generally processed HBcAgs (i.e., those which lack leader sequences) will be used in the vaccine compositions of the invention. Thus, when HBcAgs having amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs;136, 137, or 138 are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, generally 30,35-43, cff 35-43 amino add residues at the N-terminus, respectively, of each of these proteins wiU be omitted.<br>
The present invention includes vaccine compositions, as well as methods for using these conqwsitions, which employ the above described variant HBcAgs for the preparation of non-natural molecular scaffolds.<br>
Farther included withing the scope of the invention are additional HBcAg variants which are capable of associating to form diraraic or multimeric structures. Thus, the invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising HBcAg polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%. or 99% identical to any of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs;89-132 and 134-138, and forms of these proteins which have been processed, where appropriate, to remove the N-terminal leader sequence.<br>
Whether the amino acid sequence of a polyptide h an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to one of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs:89-I32 and 134-138, or a subportion thereof, can be detennined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program. When using Bfestfit or any other sequence ■alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and liiat gs in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.<br>
The HBcAg variants and precursors having the amino acid sequences set out in SEQ ID NOs:89-132 and 134-136 arc relatively similar to each other. Thus, reference to an amino acid residue of a HBcAg variant located at a position<br><br>
which corresponds to a particular position in SEQ ID NO:134, refers to the amino acid residue which is present at that position in the amino add sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134. The homology between these HBcAg variants is for the most part high enough among Hepatitis B viruses that infect mammals so that one skilled in the art would have little difficulty reviewing both the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:134 and that of a particular HBcAg variant and identifying "corresponding" amino acid residues. For exanjle, the HBcAg amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:135, which shows the amino acid sequence of a HBcAg derived from a virus which infect woodchucks, has enough homology to the HBcAg having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 that it is readily apparent that a three amino acid residue insert is present in SEQ ID NO:135 between amino acid residues 155 and 156 of SEQ ID NO: 134.<br>
The HBcAgs of Hepatitis B viruses which infect snow geese and ducks<br>
differ enough from the amino acid sequences of HBcAgs of Hepatitis B viruses<br>
which infect mammals that aUgnment of these forms of this protein with the<br>
amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 is difficult However, the<br>
invention includes vaccine compositions which comprise HBcAg variants of<br>
Hepatitis B viruses which infect birds, as wells as vaccine compositions which<br>
comprise fragments of these HBcAg variants. HBcAg fragmraits suitable for use<br>
in preparing vaccine compositions of tiie invention include compositions which<br>
contain polypeptide fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino<br>
acid residues selected from the group consisting of 36-240, 36-269, 44-240,<br>
44-269, 36-305, and 44-305 of SEQ ID NO:137 or 36-240, 36-269, 44-240,<br>
44-269. 36-305, and 44-305 of SEQ ID NO: 138. As one skilled in the art would<br>
recognize, one, two, three or more of the cysteine residues naturally present in<br>
these polypeptides (e.g., the cysteine residues at position 153 is SEQ ID NO:137<br>
or positions 34,43, and 196 in SEQ ID NO:138) could be either substituted with<br>
anothCT amino acid residue or deleted prior to their inclusion in vaccine<br>
compositions of the invention.	.     <br>
In one embodiment, the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107 of a protein having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 are deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue but the cysteme at position 61 is left in place. Further, the modified polypeptide is then used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
As set out below in Example 31, the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107, which are accessible to solvent, may be removed, for example, by site-directed mutagenesis. Further, the inventors have found that the Cys-48-Ser,<br><br>
Cys-107-Ser HBcAg double mutant constructed as described in Example 31 can be expressed in E. coli.<br>
As discussed above, the elimination of free cysteine residues reduces the number of sites where toxic components can bind to the HBcAg, and also elioMiates sites where cross-linking of lysine and cysteine residues of the same or of neighboring HBcAg molecules can occur. The cysteine at position 61, which is involved in dimer formation and fonns a disulfide bridge willi the cysteine at position 61 of another HBcAg, will normally be left int:t for stabilization of HBcAg dimers and multimers of the invention.<br>
As shown in Example 32, cross-linking experiments peEformed with (1) HBcAgs containing free cysteine residues and (2) HBcAgs whose free cysteine residues have been made uxuitactive with iodacetamide, indicate that free cysteine residues of the HBcAg are responsible for cross-linking between HBcAgs through reactions between heterobifunctional cross-linker derivatized lysine side chains, and free cysteine residues. Example 32 also indicates that cross-linking of HBcAg subunits leads to the formation of high molecular weight species of undefined size which cannot be resolved by SDS-pclyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.<br>
When an antigen or antigenic detenninant is linked to the non-natural molecular scaffold through a lysine residue, it may be advantageous to either substitute or delete one or both of the naturally resident lysine residues located at positions couesponding to positions 7 and 96 in SEQ ID NO:134, as well as other lysine residues present in HBcAg variante. The elimination of these lysine residues results in the removal of binding sites for antigens or antigenic determinants which could disrupt the ordered array and should improve the quality and uniformity of the final vaccine composition.<br>
In many instances, when both of the naturally resident lysine residues at positions corresponding to positions 7 and 96 in SEQ ID NO: 134 are eliminated, another lysine will be introduced into the HBcAg as air attachment site for an antigen or antigenic detenninant. Methods for inserting such a lysine residue are set out, for example, in Example 23 below. It will often be advantageous to introduce a lysine residue into the HBcAg when, for example, both of the naturally resident lysine residues at positions corresponding to positions 7 and 96 in SEQ ID NO:134 are altered and one seeks to attach the antigen or antigenic determinant to the non-natural molecular scaffold using a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent<br>
The C-terminus of the HBcAg has been shown to direct nuclear localization of this protein.    (Eckhardt et al., J. Virol 65:575-582 (1991).)<br><br>
Furflier, this region of the protein is also believed to confer upon the HBcAg the ability to bind nucleic acids.<br>
In some embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention will contain HBcAgs which have nucleic acid binding activity {e.g., which contain a naturally resident HBcAg nucleic acid binding domain). HBcAgs containing one or more nucleic acid binding domains are useful for preparing vaccine compositions which exhibit enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity. Thus, the vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which contain HBcAgs having nucleic acid binding activity. Further inclu{ted are vaccine compositions, as well as the use of such compositions in vaccination protocols, where HBcA are bound to nucleic acids. These HBcAgs may bind to the nucleic acids prior to administration to an individual or may bind the nucleic acids after administration.<br>
In other embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention will contain HBcAgs from which the C-terminal region (e.g., amino acid residues 145-185 or 150-185 of SEQ ID NO:134) has been removed and do not bind nucleic acids. Thus, additional modified HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include C-terminal tmncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include HBcAgs where 1,5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,39 40,41,42 or 48 amino acids have been removed from the C-terminus.<br>
HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention also include N-tenninal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include modified HBcAgs where 1, 2,5,7,9, 10, 12,14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-teraiinus.<br>
Further HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include N- and C-terminal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include HBcAgs where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus and 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 40,41,42 or 48 amino acids havg been removed from the C-tenninus.<br>
The invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising HBcAg polypeptides. comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to the above described truncation mutants.<br>
As discussed above, in certain embodiments of the invention, a lysine residue is introduced as a first attachment site into a polypeptide which fonns the non-natural molecular scaffold. In preferred embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention are prepared using a HBcAg comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acids 1-144 or amino acids 1-149 of SEQ ID NO:134 which<br><br>
is modified so that the amino acids corresponding to positions 79 and 80 are replaced with a peptide ha\ing the amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:158) and the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107 are either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue, while the cysteine at position 61 is left in place. The invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising coiresponing fragments of polypeptides having anuno acid sequences shown in any of SEQ ID NOs;89-132 and 135-136 which also have the above noted amino acid alterations.<br>
The invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising ftagments of a HBcAg comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an amino Kad sequence othra" than thai shown in SEQ ID NO: 134 from which a cysteine residue not present at corresponding location in SEQ ID NO: 134 has been deleted. One example of such a fragment would be a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acids amino acids 1-149 of SEQ DD NO:132 where the cysteine residue at position 147 has been either substituted with another amino acid residue or deleted.<br>
The invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising HBcAg polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%. or 99% identical to amino acids 1-144 or 1-149 of SEQ ID NO: 134 and corresponding subportions of a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:89-132 or 134-136, as well as to amino acids 1-147 or 1-152 of SEQ ID N0:158.<br>
The invention also includes vaccine compositions comprising HBcAg polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to amino acids 36-240, 36-269, 44-240, 44-269, 36-305, and 44-305 of SEQ ID NO: 137 or 36-240,36-269,44-240,44-269,36-305, and 44-305 of SEQ ID NO:138.<br>
Vaccine compositions of the invention -may -comprise mixtures of different HBcAgs. Thus, these vaccine compositions may be composed of HBcAgs which differ in amino acid sequence. For example, vaccine compositions could be prepared comprising a "wild-type" HBcAg and a modified HBcAg in which one or more amino acid residues have been altered {e.g., deleted, inserted or substituted), hi most applications, however, only one type of a HBcAg, or at least HBcAgs having essentially equivalent first attachment sites, will be used because vaccines prepared using such HBcAgs will present highly ordered and reptive arrays of antigens or antigenic determinants.   Further,<br><br>
preferred vaccine compositions of the invention are those which present highly ordered and repetitive antigen array<br>
The invention further includes vaccine compositions where the non-natural molecular scaffold is prepared using a HBcAg fused to another protein. As discussed above, one example of such a fusion protein is a BBcAg/FOS fusion. Other examples of HBcAg ftision proteins suitable for use in vaccine compositions of the invention include fusion proteins where an amino acid sequence has been added which aids in the formation and/or stabilization of HBcAg dimers and multimers. This additional amino acid sequence may be fused to either the N- or C-traminus of the HBcAg. One example, of such a fusion protein is a fusion of a HBcAg with the GCN4 helix region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (C5enBank Accession No. P03069 (SEQ ID NO:154)).<br>
The helix domain of the GCN4 protein forms homodimers via non-covalent interactions which can be used to prepare and stabilize HBcAg dimers and nmltimers.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides vaccine compositions prepared using HBcAg fusions proteins comprising a HBcAg, or fragment thereof, with a GCN4 polypeptide having the sequence of amino acid residues 227 to 276 in SEQ ID NO: 154 fused to the C-terminus. ITiis GCN4 polypeptide may also be fused to the N-terminus of the HbcAg.<br>
HBcAg/src homology 3 (SH3) domain fusion proteins could also be used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention. SH3 domains are relatively small domains found in a number of proteins which confer the ility to interact with specific proline-rich sequences in protein binding partners {see McPhereon, Cell Signal ii:229-238 (1999). HBcAg/SH3 fusion proteins could be used in several ways. First, the SH3 domain could form a first attachment site which interacts with a second attachment site of the antigen or antigenic determinant. Similarly, a proline rich amino acid sequence could be added to the HBcAg and used as a first attachment site for an SH3 domain second attachment site of an antigen or antigenic deteiminaiit. Second, the SHJ domain could associate with prohne rich regions introduced into HBcAgs. Thus, SH3 domains and proline rich SH3 interaction sites could be inserted into either the same or different HBcAgs and used to form and stabilized dimers and multimers of the invention,<br>
hi other embodiments, a bacterial pilin, a subportion of a bacterial pilin, or a fusion protein which contains either a bacterial pilin or subportion thereof is used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention. Examples of pilin  proteins  include  pilins   produced  by  Escherichia   coli,   Haemophilus<br><br>
influenzae. Neisseria meningitidis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Caulobacter crescenius, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomoruxs aeruginosa. The amino add sequences of pilin proteins suitable for use with the present invention include those set out in GenBank reports AJ000636 (SEQ ID NO: 139), AJ132364 (SEQ ID N0:14fl), AF229646 (SEQ ID NO.Hl), AF0518I4 (SEQ ID NO:142), AF051815 (SEQ ID NO:143), and X0O981 (SEQ ID NO:155), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Bacteria] pilin proteins are generally processed to remove N-terminal leader sequences prior to export of the proteins into the bacterial periplasm. Further, as one skilled in the art would recognize, bacterial pilin proteins used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention will generally not have the naturally present leader sequence.<br>
One specific example of a pilin protein suitable for use in the present invention is the P-pilin of E. coli (GenBank report AF237482 (SEQ ID NO:144)). An example of a T&gt;pe-1 E. coli pilin suitable for use with the invention is a pilin having the aniino acid sequence set out in GenBank report P04128 (SEQ ID NO: 146), which is encoded by nucleic acid having the nucleotide sequence set out in GenBank report M27603 (SEQ ID NO:145). The entire disclosures of these GenBank reports are incoiporated herein by reference. Again, the mature form of the above referenced protein would generally be used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
Bacterial pilins or pilin subportions suitable for use in the practice of the present invention will generally be able to associate to form non-natural molecular scaffolds.<br>
Methods for preparing pili and pilus-like structures in vitro are known in the art Bullitt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA 95:12890-12895 (1996), for example, describe the in vitro reconstitution of E. coli P-pili subunits. Further, Eshdat et al.. J. Bacterial 148:308-314 (1981) describe methods suitable for dissociating Type-1 pili of E. coli and the reconstitution of pili. In brief, these methods are as-foUows; pili are dissociated by incubation at 37°C in saturated guanidine hydrochloride. Pilin proteins are then purified by chromatography, after which pilin dimers are formed by dialysis against 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride (pH 8.0). Eshdat et al. also found that pilin dimers reassemble to form pili upon dialysis against the 5 roM tris(hydroxymethy!) aminomethane (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM MgCb.<br>
Further, using, for example, conventional genetic engineering and protein modification methods, pilin proteins may be modified to contain a first attachment site to which an antigen or antigenic detemainant is linked through a<br><br>
second attachment site. Alternatively, antigens or antigenic determinants can be directly linked through a second attachment site to amino acid residues which are naturally resident in these proteins. Hiese modified pilin proteins may then be used in vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
Bacterial pilin proteins used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention may be modified in a manner similar to that described herein for HBcAg. For example, cysteine and lysine residues may be either deleted or substituted with other amino add residues and first attachment sites may be added to these proteins. Further, pilin proteins may either be expressed in modified form or may be chemically modified after expression. Similarly, intact pili may be harvested from bacteria and then modified chemically.<br>
In another embodiment, pili or pilus-like structures are harvested fiom bacteria {e.g., E. coli) and used to form vaccine compositions of the invention. One example of pali suitable fox preparing vaccine compositions is the Type-1 pilus of K coli, which is formed from pilin monomers having the amino acid sequence set out in SHJ ID NO: 146.<br>
A number of mediods for harvesting bacterial pili are known in the art. Bullitt and Makowski iBiophys. J. 74:623-632 (1998)), for example, describe a pilus purification method for harvesting P-pili horn E. coli. According to this method, pili are sheared from hyperpiliated E. coli containing a P-pilus plasmid and purified by cycles of solubilization and MgCl2 (1.0 M) precipitation. A similar purification method is set out below in Example 33.<br>
Once harvested, pili or pilus-Uke structures may be modified in a variety of ways. For example, a first attachment site can be added to the jali to wch antigens or antigen detenninants may be attached through a second attachment site. In other words, bacterial piU or pilus-like structures can be harvested and modified to form non-naiural molecular scaffolds.<br>
Pili or pilus-hke stnictures may also be modified by the attachment of antigens or antigenic detCTminants in the absence of a non-natural organizer For example, antigens or antigenic determinants could be linked to naturally occurring cysteine resides or lysine residues. In such instances, the high order and repetitiveness of a naturally occurring amino acid residue would guide the coupling of the antigens or antigenic determinants to the pili or pfius-ltke structures. For example, the pili or pilus-like stractvires could be linked to the second attachment sites of the antigens or antigenic determinants using a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent.<br>
When structures which are naturally synthesized by organisms {e.g., pili) are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, it will often be<br><br>
advantageous to genetically engineer these organisms so that they produce structures having desirable characteristics. For example, when Type-1 pili of E. coli are used, the E. coli from which these pili are harvested may be modified so as to produce structures with specific characteristics. Examples of possible mofications of pilin. proteins include ttie insertion of one or more lysine residues, the deletion or substitution of one or more of the naturally resident lysine residues, and the deletion or substitution of one or more naturally resident cysteine residues {e.g., the cysteine residues at positions 44 and 84 in SEQ ID N0:14«).<br>
Further, additional modifications can be made to pilin genes which result in the expression products containing a first attachment site other than a lysine residue (e.g., a FOS or J17N domain). Of course, suitable first attachment sites will generally be limited to those which do no prevent pilin proteins fix&gt;m foraiing pili or pilus-like structure suitable for use in vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
Pilin genes which naturally reside in bacterial cells can be modified in vivo (e.g., by homologous recombination) or pilin genes with particular characteristics can be inserted into these cells. For examples, pilin genes could be introduced inte bacterial cells as a component of rattier a replicable cloning vector or a vector which inserts into the bacterial chromosome. The inserted pilin genes may also be linked to expression regulatory control sequences ie.g., a lac operator).<br>
In most instances, the pili or pilus-like structures used in vaccine conwsitions of the invention wiD be composed of single type of a pilin subunit Pili or pilus-like structures composed of identical subunits will generally be used because they are expected to form structures which present highly ordered and repetitive antigen arrays.<br>
However, the compositions of the invention also include vaccines comprising pili or pilus-like structures formed ftum heterogenous pilin subunits. The pUin subunits which form these pili or pilus-like structures can be expressed fium genes naturally resident in the bacterial cell or may be introduced into the ceUs. When a naturally resident pilin gene and an introduced gene are both expressed in a cell which forms piB or pilus-like structures, the result will generally be structures formed from a mixture of these piUn proteins. Further, when two or more pilin genes are expressed in a bacterial cell, the relative expression of each piUn gene will typically be the factor which determines the ratio of the different piHn subunits in the pili or pilus-like structures.<br><br>
When pili or pilus-like structures having a particular composition of mixed pilin subunits is desired, the expression of at least one of the pilin genes can be regulated by a heterologous, inducible promoter. Such promoters, as well as other genetic elements, can be used to regulate the relative amounts of different pilin subunits proceed in the bacterial cell and, hence, the composition of the pili or pilus-lifce structures.<br>
In additional, while in most instances the antigen or antigenic determinant will be linked to bacterial piH or pilus-like structures by a bond which is not a peptide bond, bacterial cells which produce pili or pilus-lifce stmctures used in the compositions of the invention can be genetically engineered to generate pilin proteins which are fused to an antigen or antigenic determinant. Such fusion proteins which form pili or pilus-like structures are suitable for use in vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
As already discussed, viral capsids may be used for (I) the presentation or antigen or antigenic determinants and (2) the preparation of vaccine compositions of the invention. Particularly, useful in the practice of the invention are viral capsid proteins, also referred to herein as "coat proteins," which upon expression form capsids or capsid-Iike structures. Thus, these csid proteins can form core particles and non-natural molecular scaffolds. Generally, these capsids or capsid-Uke structures form ordered and repetitive arrays which can be used for the presentation of antigens or antigenic determinants and the preparation of vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
One or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, etc.) antigens or antigenic determinants may be attached by any number of means to one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, etc.) proteins which form viral capsids or capsid-like structures (e.g., bacteriophage coat proteins), as well as other proteins. For example, antigens or antigenic determinants may be attached to core particles using first and second attachment sites. Further, one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, etc.) heterobifunctional crosslinkers can be used to attach antigens or antigenic determinants to one or more proteins which fonn viral capsids or capsid-like structures.<br>
Viral capsid proteins, or fi:gments thereof may be used, for example, to prepare core particles and vaccine compositions of the invention. Bacteriophage Q coat proteins, for example, can be expressed recombinantly in E. coli. Further, upon such expression these proteins spontaneously form capsids. Additionally, these capsids form ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays which can be used for antigen presentation and the preparation of vaccine compositions.  As described below in Example 38, bacteriophage Qp<br><br>
coat proteins can be used to prepare vaccine compositions which elicit immunological responses to antigenic determinants.<br>
Specific examples of bacteriophage coat proteins which can be used to prepare compositions of the invention include the coat proteins of RNA bacteriophages such as bacteriophage Qp (SEQ ID NO:159; PIR Database, Accession No. VCBPQ3 refeiring to Qp CP and SEQ ID NO: 217; Accession No. AAA16663 referring to Q|3 Al protein), bacteriophage R17 (SEQ ED NO:160; PIR Accession No. VCBPR7), bacteriophage fr (SEQ ID N0:161; PIR Accession No. VCBPFR), bacteriophage GA (SEQ ID NO: 162; GenBank Accession No. NP-040754), bacteriophage SP (SEQ ID NO:163; GenBank Accession No. CAA30374 referring to SP CP and SEQ ID NO: 254; Accession No. referring to SP Al protein), bacteriophage MS2 (SEQ ID NO:I64; FIR Accession No. VCBPM2), bacteriophage Mil (SEQ ID NO:165; GenBank Accession No. AAC06250), bacteriophage MXl (SEQ ID NO:I66; GenBank Accession No. AAC14699), bacteriophage NL95 (SEQ ID NO;167; GenBank Accession No. AAC14704), bacteriophage f2 (SEQ ID NO: 215; GenBank Accession No. P03611), bacteriophage PP7 (SEQ ID NO: 253), As one skilled in the art would recognize, any protein which forms capsids or capsid-like structures can be used for the IHeparation of vaccine compositions of the invention. Furthermore, the Al protein of bacteriophage Q|3 or C-temnnal truncated forms missing as much as 100, 150 or 180 amino acids from its C-terminus may be incorporated in a capsid assembly of QP coat proteins. The Al protein may also be fused to an organizer and hence a first attachment site, for attachment of Antigens containing a second attachment site. Generally, the percentage of A1 protein relative to Qp CP in the capsid assembly will be UiiHted, in order to insure csid formation. Al protein accession No. AAA16663 (SEQ ID NO: 217).<br>
QP coat protein has also been found to self-assemble into capsids when expressed in JE, coli (KozlovskaTM. et al", GENE W". 133-137 (1993)). The obtained capsids or virus-Hke particles showed an icosahedral phage-like capsid structure with a diameter of 25 nm and T=3 quasi symmetry. Further, the crystal structure of phage QP has been solved. The capsid contains 180 copies of the coat protein, which are linked in covalent pentamers and hexamers by disulfide bridges (Golmohammadi, R. et cd.. Structure 4:543-5554 (1996)). Other RNA phage coat proteins have also been shown to self-assemble upon expression jn a bacterial host (Kastelein, RA. et al.. Gene 23:245-254 (1983), Kozlovskaya, TM. et al, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 287:452-455 (1986), Adhin, MR. et al.. Virology 170: 238-242<br><br>
*(1989), Ni, CZ.. et al.. Protein Sci. 5: 2485-2493 (1996), Priano, C. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 249; 283-297 (1995)). The QP phage capsid contains, in addition to the coat protein, the so called read-through protein Al and the maturation protein A2. Al is generated by suppression at the UGA stop codon and has a length of 329 aa. The capsid of phage QP recombinant coat protein used in the invention is devoid of the A2 lysis protein, and contains RNA from the host. The coat protein of RNA phages is an RNA binding protein, and into-acts with the stem loop of the ribosomal binding site of the replicase gene acting as a translational repressor during the life cycle of the vims. The sequence and structural elements of the interaction are known (Witherell, GW. &amp; Uhlenbeck, OC. Biochemistry 28: 71-76 (1989); Lim F. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:31839-31845 (1996)). The stem loop and RNA in general are known to be involved in the virus assembly (Golmohammadi, R. et al.. Structure 4: 543-5554 (1996))<br>
Proteins or protein domains may affect the structure and assembly of the particle even more then a short peptide. As an example, proper folding of antigens comprising disulfide bridges will generally not be possible in the cytoplasm of E. coli, where the QP particles are expressed. Likewise, glycosylation is generally not possible in prokaryotic expression systems. It is therefore an advantage of the contemplated invention described here to attach the antigen to the particle by starting with the already assembled particle and the isolated antigen. This allows expression of both the particle and the antigen in an expression host guaranteeing prop folding of the antigen, and proper folding and assembly of the particle.<br>
It is a finding of this invention, that one or several several antigen molecules maybeattachedtoonesubunit of the capsid of RNA phages coat proteins. A specific feature of the capsid of the coat protein of RNA phages and in particular of QP csid ■ is thus the possibility to couple several antigens po" subunit This allows for the generation of a dense antigen array. Other viral capsids used for covalent attachment of antigens by way of chemical cross-linking, such for example a HBcAg modified with a lysine residue in its major immunodominant region (MIR; WO 00/32227), show coupling density of maximally 0.5 antigens per subunit The distance between the spikes (corresponding to the MIR) of HBcAg is 50 A (Wynne, SA. et al., Mol. Cell 3:771-780 (1999)), and therefore an antigen array with distances shorter than 50 A cannot be generated<br><br>
-4-;-Csids of QP coat protein display a defined number of lysine residues on<br>
their surface, with a defined topology with three lysine residues pointing towards the<br>
interior of the capsid and interacting with the RNA, and four other lysine residues<br>
exposed to the exterior of the capsid. These defined properties favor the attachment of<br>
antigens to the exterior of the particle, and not to the interior where the lysine residues<br>
interact with RNA. Capsids of other RNA phage coat proteins also have a defined<br>
number of lysine residues on thdr surface and a defined topology of tiiese lysine<br>
residues. Another advantage of the csids derived fiom RNA phages is their high<br>
expression yield in bacteria, that allows to produce large quantities of material at<br>
affordable cost.<br>
Another feature of the capsid of QP coat protein is its stability. QP subunits are bound via disulfide bridges to each other, covalently linking the subunits. Qp capsid protein also shows unusual resistance to organic solvents and denaturing agents. Surprisingly, we have observed that DMSO and acetonitrile concentrations as high as 30%, and Guanidinium concentrations as high as 1 M could be used without affecting the stability or the ability to form antigen arrays of the capsid. Thus, theses (ffganic solvents may be used to couple hydrophobic peptides. The high stability of the capsid of Qp coat protein is an important feature pertaining to its use for immunization and vaccination of mammals and humans in particular. The resistance of the capsid to organic solvent allows the coupling of antigens not soluble in aqueous buffers.<br>
Insertion of a cysteine residue into the N-teiminal P-haiipin of the coat protein of the RNA phage MS-2 has been described in the patent application US/5,698,424. We note however, that the presence of an exposed free cysteine residue in the capsid may lead to oligomerization of csids by way of disulfide bridge formation. Other " attachments contemplated in patent application tJS/5,698,424 involve the formation of disulfide bridges between the antigen and the Qp particle. Such attachments are labile to sulfhydryl-moiety containing molecules.<br>
The reaction between an initial disulfide bridge formed with a cys-residue on QP, and the antigen containing a free sulfhydryl residue releases sulfhydryl containing species other than the antigen. These newly formes sulfhydryl containing species can react again with other disulfide bridges present on the particle, thus establishing an equilibrium. Upon reaction with the disulfide bridge formed on the<br><br>
particle, the antigen may either form a disulfide bridge with the cys-residue from the particle, or with the cys-residue of the leaving group molecule which was forming the initial disulficte bridge on the particle. Moreover, the other method of attachment descaibed, using a hetero-bifunctional cross-linker reacting with a cysteine on the QP particle on one side, and with a lysine residue on tiie antigen on the other side, leads to a random orientation of the antigens on the particle.<br>
We further note that, in contrast to the capsid of the QP and Fr coat proteins, recombinant MS-2 described in patent plication US/5,698,424 is essentially free of nucleic acids, while RNA is packaged inside the two capsids mentioned above.<br>
We describe new and inventive compositions allowing the formation of robust antigen arrays with variable antigen density. We show that much higher epitope density can be achieved than usuaUy obtained with other VLPs. We also disclose compositions with simultaneous display of several antigens widi appropriate spacing, and compositions wherein the addition of accessory molecules, enhancing solubility or modifiying the capsid in a suitable and desired way.<br>
The preparation of compositions of capsids of RNA phage coat proteins with a high epitope density is disclosed in this application. As a skilled artisan in the Art would know, the conditions for the assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array depend for a good part on the antigen and on the selection of a second attachment site on the antigen. In the case of the absence of a useful second attachment site, such a second attachment has to be engineered to the antigen.<br>
A prerequisite in designing a second attachment site, is the choice of the position at which it should be fijsed, inserted or generally engineered. A skilled artisan would know how to find guidance in selecting the position of the second attachment site. A crystal structure of die antigen may provide information on the availability of the C- or N-termini of the molecule (determined for example from their accessibility to solvent), or on the exposure to solvent of residues suitable for use as second attachment sites, such as cysteine residues. Exposed distilfide bridges, as is the case for Fab fragments, may also be a soiue of a second attachment site, since they can be generally converted to single cysteine residues through mild reduction. In general, in the case where immunization vnth a self-antigen is aiming at inhibiting the interaction of this self-antigen with its natural Ugands, the second attachment site will<br><br>
i<br>
be added such that it allows generation of antibodies against the site of interaction with the natural ligands. Thus, the location of the second attachment site will selected such, that steric hindrance from the second attachment site or any amino acid linker containing it, is avoided Li fiirther embodiments, an antibody response directed at a site distinct ftxim the interaction site of the self-antigen with its natural ligand is desired In such embodiments, the second attachment site may be selected such that it prevents generation of antibodies against the intertion site of the self-antigen with its natural ligands.<br>
Other criteria in selecting the position of the second attachment site include the oligomerization state of the antigen, the site of oligomerization, the presence of a cofactor, and llie availability of experimental evidence disclosing sites in the antigen structure and sequence where modification of the antigen is compatible with the function of the seff-antigen, or with the generation of antibodies recognizing the self-antigen.<br>
In some embodiments, engineering of a second attachment site onto the antigen requires the fusion of an amino acid linker containing an amino acid suitable as second attachment site according to the disclosures of this invention. In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid is cysteine. Tlie selection of the amino acidd linker will be dependent on the nature of the self-antigen, on its biochemical properties, such as pi, charge distribution, glycosylation. In general, flexible amino acid linkers are favored Examples of amino acid linkers are the hinge region of Immunoglobulins, glycine serine linkera (GGGGS),,, and glycine linkers (G)n all further containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and optionally further glycine residues. (In the following arc examples of said amino acid linkers :<br>
N-tenninal gammal: CGDKTHTSPP<br>
C-terminal gamma 1; DKTHTSPPCG<br>
N-terminal gamma 3: CGGPKPSTPPGSSGGAP<br>
C-tenninal gamma 3: PKPSTPPGSSGGAPGGCG<br>
N-teiminal glycine linker: GCGGGG<br>
C-tenninal glycine linker: GGGGCG)<br><br>
For peptides, GGCG linkers at the C-terminus of the peptide, or CGG at its N"tenninus have shown to be useful. Li general, glycine residues will be inserted between bulky amino acids and the cysteine to be used as second attachment site.<br>
A particularly favored method of attachment of antigens to VLPs, and in particular to capsids of RNA phage coat proteins is the linldng of a lysine rraidue on the surface of the capsid of RNA phage coat proteins with a cysteine residue on the antigen. To be effective as second attachment site, a sulfliydryl group must be available for coupling. Thus, a cysteine residue has to be in its reduced state, that is a ftee cysteine or a cysteine residue with a free sulfliydryl group has to be available. In the instant where the cysteine residue to function as second attachment site is in an oxidized fonn, for example if it is forming a disulfide bridge, reduction of this disulfide bridge with e.g. DTT, TCEP or p-mercaptoethanol is required.<br>
It is a finding of this application that epitope density on the capsid of RNA phage coat proteins can be modulated by the choice of cross-hnker and other reaction conditions. For example, the cross-linkers Sulfo-GMBS and SMPH allow reaching higher epitope density than the cross-linker Sulfo-MBS under the same reaction conditions. Derivatization is positively influenced by high concentration of reactands, and manipulation of the reaction conditions can be used to control the number of antigens coupled to RNA images capsid proteins, and in particular to QP csid protein.<br>
From theoretical calculation, the maximally achievable number of globular protein antigens of a size of 17 kDa does not exceed 0.5. TTius, several of the lysine residues of the capsid of QP coat protein will be derivatized with a cross-linker molecule, yet be devoid of antigen. This leads to the disappearance of a positive charge, which may be detrimental to the solubility and stability of the conjugate. By replacing siome of the lysine residues with arginines, such is the case in the disclosed QP coat protein mutant, we prevent the excessive disappearance of positive charges since the arginine residues do not react with the cross-linkra-.<br>
In furthra" embodiments, we disclose a QP mutant coat protein with additional lysine residues, suitable for obtaining high density arrays of antigens.<br>
The  crystal  structure of several RNA bacteriophages  has  been determined (Golmohammadi, R. et al., Structure "#;543-554 (1996)).  Using such<br><br>
information, one skilled in the art could readily identify surface exposed residues and modify bacteriophage coat proteins such that one or more reactive amino acid residues can be inserted. Thus, one skilled in the art could readily generate and identify modified forms of bacteriophage coat proteins which can be used in the practice of the invention. Thus, variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-Iike structures (e.g., coat proteins of bacteriophage QP, bacteriophage R17, bacteriophage fc, bacteriophage GA, bacriophage SP, and bacteriophage MS2) can also be used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
Although the sequence of the variants proteins discussed above will diffH- from their wild-type counterparts, these variant proteins will generally retain the ability to form cids or capsid-like structures. Thus, the invention further includes vaccine compositions which contain variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures, as well as methods for preparing such vaccine compositions, individual protein subunits used to prepare such vaccine compositions, and nucleic acid molecules which encode diese protein subunits. Hius, included within the scope of the invention are variant forms of wild-type proteins which form ordered and repetitive antigen arrays (e.g., variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures) and retain the ability to associate and form capsids or capsid-like structures.<br>

In many instances, these proteins will be processed to remove signal peptides (e.g., heterologous signal peptides).<br>
Further included within the scope of the invention are nucleic acid molecules which encode proteins used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention.<br>
In particular embodiments, the invention fuilher includes vaccine compositions comprising proteins pomprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino"scid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to any of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs:159-167, and forms of these proteins which have been processed, where appropriate, to remove the N-terminal leader sequence.<br>

Specific examples of such truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shovra in any of SEQ ID NOs:159-167 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 ammo acids<br><br>

B.       Construction of an Antigen or Antigenic Determinant with a Second Attachment Site<br><br>
The second element in the compositions of the invention is an antigen or antigenic determinant possessing at least one second attachment site enable of association through at least one non-peptide bond to the first attachment site of the non-natural molecular scaffold. The invention provides for compositions that vary according to the antigen or antigenic determinant selected in consideration of the desired therieutic effect. Other compositions are provided by varying the molecule selected for the second attachment site.<br>
However, when bacterial pili, or pilus-Uke structures, pilin proteins are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, antigens or antigenic determinants may be attached to pilin proteins by the expression of pilin/antigen fusion proteins. Similarly, when proteins other than pilin proteins (e.g., viral capsid proteins) are used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention, antigens or antigenic determinants may be attached to these non-pilin proteins fay the expression of non-pilin protein/antigen fusion proteins. Antigens or antigenic determinants may also be attached to bacterial pili, pilus-Uke structures, pilin proteins, and other proteins which form ordered arrays through non-peptide bonds.<br>
Antigens of the invention may be selected from the group consisting of the following: (a) proteins suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (b) proteins suited to induce an immune response against infectious diseases; (c) proteins suited to induce an immune response against allergens ,(d) proteins suited to induce an immune response in farm animals, and (e) fragments (e.g., a domain) of any of the proteins set out in (a)-(d).<br>
In one specific embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic dstenmaant is one that is useful for the prevention of infectious disease. Such treatment will be usefiil to treat a wide variety of infectious diseases affecting a wide range of hosts, e.g,, human, cow, sheep, pig. dog, cat, other manamalian species and noD-mammalian species as well. Treatable infectious diseases are well known to those skilled in the art, examples include infections of viral etiology such as HTV, influenza, Herpes, viral hepatitis, Epstein Bar, polio, viral encephalitis, measles, chicken pox, etc.; or infections of bacterial etiology such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, syphilis, etc.; or infections of parasitic etiology such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, etc. Thus, antigens or antigenic determinants selected for the compositions of the invention will be well known to those in the medical ait; examples of antigens or antigenic determinants include the following", the HIV antigens 140 and gpl60; the inflnenaza antigens hemaggintinin, M2 protein and neuraminidase. Hepatitis B surface antigen, circumsporozoite protein of malaria.<br>
In specific embodiments, the invention provides vaccine compositions suitable for use in methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions which are<br><br>
caused or exacerbated by "self gene products {e.g., tumor necrosis factors). Thus, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate diseases or conditions caused or exacerbated by "self" gene products. Examples of such diseases or conditions include graft versus host disease, IgE-mediated allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, Crohn"s disease, allergic asthma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin"s lymphoma (NHL), Graves" disease, systemic lupus aythematosus <sle inflammatory autoimmune diseases myasthenia gravis iramunoproliferative disease lymphadenopathy angioimmunoproliferative immunoblastive rtieumatoid arthritis diabetes multiple sclerosis alzheimer and osteoporosis.></sle>
In related specific embodiments, compositions of the invention are an immunotherapeutic that may be used for the treatment of allergies or cancer.<br>
Ths selection of antigens or antigenic determinants for the preparation of conqrasitions and for use in methods of treatment for allergies would be known to those skilled in the medical arts treating such disorders. Representative examples of such antigens or antigenic determinants include the following: bee venom phospholipase Az, Bet v I (birch pollen allergen), 5 Dol m V (white-faced hornet venom allergen), Mellitin and Der p I (House dust mite allergen), as well as fragments of each which can be used to elicit immunological responses.<br>
As indicated, a preferred antigen or antigenic determinant is Der p I. Der p I is a 25kD protease found in house dust mite faecal particles. Der p I represents the major allergic molecule of house dust mite. Accordingly, 80% of mite allergic patients have anti-Der p I IgE antibodies. In particular, the peptides p52-72 and pi 17-133, among others, are known to comprise epitopes, which are recognized by antibodies specific for the native Der p I. IgE antibodies raised in a polyclonal response to the whole antigen bind with high affinity to the peptide region 59-94 (L. Pierson-Mullany et al. (2000) Molecular Immunology). Other regions also bind IgE with high affinity. The peptide pi 17-133 contains"a free cysteine at its N-terminus, preferably representing the second attachment site in accordance with the invention. 3D model assigns peptides p52-72 andpll7-133 to the surface of the whole protein. However, other fragments of the Der p I protein may comprise B cell epitopes being preferably suitable for the present invention.<br>
The selection of antigens or antigenic determinants for compositions and methods of treatment for cancer would be known to those skilled in the medica! arts treating such disorders.    Representative examples of such types of antigens or<br><br>
antigenic detaminants include llie following: Her2 (breast cancer), GD2 (neuroblastoma), EGF-R (malignant glioblastoma), CEA (medullary thyroid cancer), and CD52 Oeukemia), human melanoma protein gplOO, human, melanoma protein melan-A/MART-1, tyrosinase, NA17-A nt protein, MAGE-3 protein, p53 protein, HPV16 E7 protein, as well as fragments of each which can be used to elicit immunological responses.Further preferred antigenic determinants useful for compositions and methods of treatment for cancer are molecules and antigenic determinants involved in angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plajs an essential role in physiological and pathophysiological processes such as wound healing and solid tumor growth, respectively olkman, J. (1995) Nat medicine 1, 27-31; Folkman, J., and Klagsbrun, M. (1987) Sciaicc 235, 442W6; Martiny-Baron, G., and Marm6, D. (1995) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 6,675-680; Risau, W. (1997) Nature 386, 671-674). Rapidly growing tumors initiate and depend on the formation of blood vessels to provide the required blood supply. Thus, antiangiogenic agents might be effective as an anticancer therapy.<br>
Among several putative angiogenic factors that have been identified so far vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent endothelial cell specific mitogen and a primary stimulant of the vascularization of many solid tumors. Although recent fintUngs impUcate that a set of angiogenic factors must be perfectly orchestrated to form functional vessels, it seems that the blockade of even a angle growth factor might limit disease-induced vascular growth. Thus, blockade of VEGF may be a premium target for intervention in tumor induced angiogenesis. To target the endothelium rather than the tumor itself has recently emerged as a novel strategy to fit tumors (Millauer, B., Shawver, L. K., Plate, K. H., Risau, W., and Ulkich, A. (1994) Nahtte 367, 575-579; Kim, J., Li, B., Winer, J., Armanini, M., Gillett, N., Phillip, H. S., Ferrara, N. (1993) Nature 362, 841-844). In contrast to tumors, which easily mutate target structures reccTgnized by the immune system, endothelial cells do not usually escape the immune system or other therapeutic regimens.<br>
An anti-VEGFR-H antibody (MC-lCl 1) and an and-VEGF antibody have been disclosed (Lu, D., Kussie, P., Pytowsld, B., Persaud, K., Bohlen, P.. Witte, L., Zhu, Z. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,14321-14330; Presta, L.G, Chen, H., O"Connor, SJ., Chisholm. V., Meng, YG., Krummen, L.. Winkler, M., Ferrara N. (1997) Cancer Res. 47.4593-4599). The forma: neutralizing monoclonal anti-VEGFR-2 antibody<br><br>
recognizes an epitope that has been identified as putative VEGFA"EGFR-II binding site (Piossek, C, Schneidra--Mergener, J., Schimer, M., Vakalopoulou, E., Gemieroth, L., Thierauch, K.H. (1999) J Biol Chem. 274,5612-5619).<br>
ThuE, in another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is a peptide derived from the VEGFR-II contact site. ITiis provides a composition and a vaccine composition in accordance with the invention, which may have antiangiogenic propatieE useful for the treatment of cancer. Inhibition of tumor growth in mice using sera specific for VEGFR-2 has been demonstrated (Wei, YQ-, Wang, QR., aao, X., Yang, L., Tian, L.. Lu, Y., Kang, B., Lu, CJ., Huang, MJ., Lou, YY., Xiao, E, He, QM., Shu, JM., Xie, XJ., Mao, YQ., Lei, S., Luo, F., Zhou, LQ.. Liu, CE., Zhou, a, Jiang, Y.. Peng, F., Yuan, LP., li, Q., Wu, Y., liu, JY. (2000) Nature Medicine 6,1160-1165). Therefore, further preferred antigenic determinants suitable for inventive compositions and antianogenic vaccine compositions in accordance with the invention comprise either the human VEGF!R-n derived peptide with the sequence CTARTELNVGIDFNWEYPSSKHQHKK:, and/or the murine VEGFR-II derived peptide having the sequence<br>
CTARTELNTVGLDFTWHSPPSKSHHKK, and/or the relevant extracellular globular domains 1-3 of tiie VEGFR-H.<br>
TTierefore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vaccine composition comprises a core particle selected from a virus-like particle or a bacterial pilus and a VEGFR-H derived peptide or a fragment thereof as an antigen or antigenic detominant in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The selection of antigens or antigenic detemiinants for compositions and methods of treatment for other diseases or conditions associated with self antigens would be also known to those skilled in the mechcal arts treating such (tisorders. Representative examples of such antigens or antigenic detemiinants are, for example, lynhotoxins (e.g. Lymphotoxin a (LT a), Lympholoxin p (LT p)), and lymphotoxin receptors. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL), vascular endothelial growfti factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R), Interleukin-5, Interleukin-17, iiterleukin-13, CCL21, CXCL12, SDF-1, MCP-1, Endoglin, Resistin, GHRH, IHRH, TRH, MIF, Eotaxin, Bradyltiflin, BLC, Tumor Necrosis Factor a and amyloid beta peptide (APM2) (SEQ ID NO: 220), as well as fragments of each which can be used to elicit immunological responses. In a<br><br>
preferred embodiment, the antigen is the amyloid beta peptide (APi-42) (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL VFFAEDVGSNKGAnGLMVGGWIA (SEQ ID NO: 220), or a fragment thereof. Tlie amyloid beta protein is SEQ ID NO: 218. The amyloid beta precursor protein is SEQ ID NO: 219.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is an angiotensin peptide or a fragment thereof. The term "anotensin peptide" as used herein, shall encompass any peptide comprising the sequence, or fragments thereof, of angiotensinogen, angiotensin I or angiotensin IL The sequences are as follows: Angiotensinogen: DRVYIHPFHLVIHN; Angiotensin L DRVYIHPEHL; Angiotensin II: DRVYIHPF. Typically, one or more additional amino acids are added either at the C- or at the N-terminus of the angiotensin peptide sequences. The sequence of the angiotensin peptides corresponds to the human sequence, which is identical to the murine sequence. Therefore, immunization of a human or a mouse with vaccines or compositions, respectively, comprising such angiotensin peptides as antigenic determinant in accordance with the invention, is a vaccination against a self-antigen. Those additional amino acids are, in particular, valuable for an oriented and ordered association to the core particle.<br>
Preferably, the angiotensin peptide has an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) the amino acid sequence of CGGDRVYIHPF; b) the amino acid sequence of CGGDRVYIHPFHL; c) the amino acid sequence of DRVYffiPFHLGGC; and d) the amino acid sequence of CDRVYIHPFH. Angiotensin I is cleaved from angiotensinogen (14aa) by the kidney-derived enzyme Renin. Angiotensin I is a biologically inactive peptide of 10 aa. It is further cleaved at die N-tenninus fay angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) into die biologically active 8aa angiotensin U. Tliis peptide binds to the antgiotensin receptors ATII and AT2 which leads to vasoconstriction and aldosterone release.<br>
A vaccine in accordance with the present invention comprising at least one angiotensin peptide may be used for the treatment of hypertension.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the antigen br antigenic determinant is selected from the group consisting of: (a) a recombinant protein of HIV, (b) a recombinant protein of Influenza vims (e.g., an Influenza virus M2 protein or a fragment thereof), (c) a recombinant protein of Hepatitis C virus, (d) a recombinant protein of Toxoplasma, (e) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium falciparum, (f) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium vivax (g) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium ovale, (h) a recombinant protein of Plasmodium malariae, (i) a recombinant protein of breast cancer cells, (j) a recombinant protein of kidney cancer cells, (k) a recombinant protein of prostate cancer cells,. (1) a recombinant protein of<br><br>
skin cancer cells, (m) a recombinant protein of brain cancer cells, (n) a recombinant protein of leukemia cells, (o) a recombinant profiling, (p) a recombinant protein of bee sting allergy, (q) a recombinant proteins of nut allergy, (r) a recombinant proteins of food allergies, (s) recombinant proteins of asthma, (t)a recombinant protein of Chlamydia, and (u) a fragment of any of the proteins set out in (a)-(t).<br>
Once the antigen or antigenic determinant of the composition is chosen, at least one second attachment site may be added to the molecule in preparing to construct the organized and repetitive array associated with the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention. Knowledge of what will constitute an ipropriate second attachment site will be known to those skilled in the art. Representative examples of second attachment sites include, but are not limited to, the following: an antigen, an antibody or antibody fragment, biotin, avidin, strepavidin, a receptor, a receptor ligand, a hgand, a ligand-binding protein, an interacting leucine zipper polypeptide, an amino group, a chemical group reactive to an amino group; a carboxyl group, chemical group reactive to a carboxyl group, a sulfhydryl group, a chemical group reactive to a sulfhydryl group, or a combination thereof.<br>
The association between the first and second attachment sites will be detemiined by the characteristics of the respective molecules selected but will comprise at least one non-peptide bond. Depending upon the combination of first and second attachment sites, the nature of the association may be covalent, ionic, hydrophobic, polar, or a combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the second attachment site may be the FOS leucine zipper protein domain or the JUN leucine zipper protein domain.<br>
In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the second attachment site selected is the FOS leucine zippo- proton domain, which associates specifically with the JUN leucine zipper protein domain of the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention. The association of the JUN and FOS leucine zipper protein domains provides a basis for the formation of an organized and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array on the surface of the scaffold. The FOS leucine zipper proton domain may be fused in frame to the antigen or antigenic determinant of choice at either the amino terminus, carboxyl terminus or internally located in the protein if desired.<br>
Several FOS fusion constructs are provided for exemplary purposes. Human growth hormone (Example 4), bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (Example 9), ovalbumin (Example 10) and HTV gpl40 (Example 12).<br>
In order to simplify the generation of FOS fusion constructs, several vectors are disclosed that provide options for antigen or antigenic detwininant design and construction (see Example 6). The vectore pAVM wae designed for the expression<br><br>
of FOS fusion in E. coli; the vectors pAV5 and pAV6 were designed for the expression of FOS fusion proteins in eukaryotic cells. Properties of these vectors are briefly described:<br>
1-	pAVl: This vector was designed for the secretion of fusion proteins with FOS at the C-teiminus into the E. coli penplasmic space. The gene of interest (g,o.i.) may be hgated into the StuI/NotI sites of the vector.<br>
2-	pAV2: This vector was designed for the secretion of fusion proteins with FOS at the N-tenninus into the E. coli penplasmic space. The gene of intMst ($.0.1.) ligated into the NotKEcoRV (or Notl/Hjndlll) sites of the vector.<br><br>
3.	pAV3: This vector was designed for the cytoplasmic production of fusion proteins with FOS at the C-tenninus in E. coli. The gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be ligated into the EcoRV/NotI sites of the vector.<br>
4.	pAV4: This vector is designed for the cytoplasmic production of fusion proteins with FOS at the N-terminus in E. coli. The gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be ligated into the NotKEcoRV (or Noti/ffindlD) sites of the vectw. The N-tenninal methionine residue is proteolytically removed upon protein synthesis (HLrel et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA S(5:8247-8251 (1989)).<br>
5.	pAV5: This vector was designed for the eukaryotic production of fusion proteins with FOS at the C-terminus. The gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be inserted between the sequences coding for the hGH signal sequence and the FOS domain by ligation into the Eco47III/NotI sites of the vector. Alternatively, a gene containing its own signal sequence may be fused to the FOS coding region by ligation into the Stul/NotI sites.<br>
6.	pAV6: This vector was designed for the eukaryotic production of fiision proteins with FOS at the N-teiminus. "Hie gene of interest (g.o.i.) may be ligated into the Notl/StuI (or Notl/IBndlll) sites of the vector.<br>
As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the construction of a FOS-antigen or -antigenic determinant fusion protein may include the addition of certain genetic elements to facilitate production of the recombinant protein. Example 4 provides guidance for the addition of certain E. coli regulatory elements for translation, and Example 7 provides guidance for the addition of a eukaryotic signal sequence. Other genetic elements may be selected, depending on the specific needs of the practioner.<br>
The invention is also seen to ioclude the production of the FOS-antigen or F05-antigenic determinant fusion protein either in bacterial (Example 5) or eukaryotic cells (Example 8). The choice of which cell type in which to express the fusion protein is within the knowledge of the skilled artisan, depending on factors<br><br>
such as whether post-translationai modifications are an inrtant consideration in the design of the composition.<br>
As noted previously, the invention discloses various methods for the construction of a FOS-antigen or FOS-antigenic determinant fusion protein through the use of the pAV vectors. In addition to enabling prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression, these vectors allow the practitioner to choose between N- and C-terminal addition to the antigen of the FOS leucine zipper protein domain. Specific examples are provided wherein N- and C-tenninal FOS fusions are made to PLAj (Example 9) and ovalbumin (Example 10). Exanle 11 demonstrates tfie purification of the PLA2 and ovalbumin FOS fiision proteins.<br>
In a more specific embodiment, the invention is drawn to an antigen or antigenic determinant encoded by the HIV genome. More specifically, the HIV antigen or antigenic determinant is gpl40. As provided for in Exanles 11-15, HIV gpl40 may be created with a FOS leucine zipper protein domain and the fusion protem synthesized and purified for attachment to the non-natural molecular scaffold of the invention. As one skilled in the art would know, other HIV antigens or antigenic determinants may be used in tiie creation of a composition of the invention.<br>
in another more specific embodiment, the invention is drawn to vaccine compositions conrising at least one antigen or antigenic determinaut encoded by an Influenza viral nucleic acid, and the use of such vaccine compositions to elicit immune responses. In an even more specific embodiment, the Mluenza antigen or antigenic determinant may be an M2 protein ifi.g., an M2 protein having the amino acids shown in SEQ ID NO:2l3, GenBank Accession No. P06g21, or in SEQ ID NO: 212, PIR Accession No. MFIV62, or fragment thereof (e.g., amino acids from about 2 to about 24 in SEQ ID NO:213. the ammo acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:212). Further, influenza antigens or antigenic determinants may be coupled to non-natural molecular scaffolds or core particles through either peptide or non-peptide bonds. When Influenza antigens or antigenic determinants are coupled to non-natural molecular scaffolds or core particles throu peptide bonds, the molecules which form order and repetitive arrays will generally be prepared as fusion protein expression products. The more preferred embodiment is however a composition, wherein the M2 peptide is coupled by chemical cross-Unking, to Qp capsid protein HBcAg capsid protein or Pili according to the disclosures of the invention.<br>
Portions of an M2 protein (e.g., an M2 protein having the amino acid sequence in SHJ ID NO:213), as well as other proteins against wMch an immunological response is sought, suitable for use with the invention may comprise, or alternatively consist of, peptides of any number of amino acids in length but will generally be at least 6 amino acids in length {e.g., peptides 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 12,15,18,<br><br>
20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 91 amino acids in length).<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, the second attachment site selected is a cysteine residue, which associates specifically with a lysine residue of the non-natural molecular scaffold or core particle of the invention, or the second attachment site selected is a lysine residue, which associates specifically with a cysteine residue of the non-natural molecular scaffold or core particle of the invention. The chemical linkage of the lysine residue (Lys) and cysteine residue (Cys) provides a basis for the formation of an organized and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array on the surface of the scaffold or core particle. The cysteine or lysine residue may be engineered in frame to the antigen or antigenic determinant of choice at either the amino terminus, carboxyl terminus or internally located in the protein if desired. By way of example, PIA2 and HIV gpl40 are provided with a cysteine residue for linkage to a lysine residue first attachment site. In additional specific embodiments, the invention provides vaccine compositions suitable for use in methods for preventing and/or attenuating allergic reactions, such as allergic reactions which lead to anaphylaxis. Thus, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate allergic reactions. Tlius, in certain embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which eUcit an immunological response against an allergen. Examples of such allergens include phospholipases such as the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) proteins of Apis mellifera (SEQ ID NO:168, GenBank Accession No. 443189; SEQ ID NO: 169, GenBank Accession No. 229378), Apis dorsata (SEQ ID NO: 170, GenBank Accession No. B59055), Jis cerana (SEQ ID NO:171, GenBank Accession No. A59055), Bombus permsylvanicus (SEQ ID NO:172 GenBank Accession No. B56338), and Heloderma suspectum (SEQ ID NO:173, GenBank Accession No. P800O3; SEQ ID NO:174, GenBank Accession No. S14764; SEQ ID NO:175, GenBank Accession No. 226711).<br>
Using the amino acid sequence of a PLA2 protein of Apis mellifera (SEQ ID NO: 168) for illustration, peptides of at least about 60 amino acids in length, which represent any portion of the whole PIA2 sequence, may also be used in compositions for preventing and/or attenuating allergic reactions. Examples of such peptides include peptides which comprise amino acids 1-60 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 1-70 in SEQ ID NO:168, ammo acids 10-70 in SEQ ID N0:16S, amino acids 20-80 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 30-90 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 40-100 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 47-99 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 50-UO m SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 60-120 in SEQ ID NO:168, ammo acids 70-130 in SEQ ID NO: 168, or amino acids 90-134 in SEQ ID NO: 168, as well corresponding portions of<br><br>
other PIA2 proteins (e.g., PLAj proteins described above). Further examples of such peptides include peptides which comprise amino acids 1-10 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 5-15 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 10-20 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 20-30 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 30-40 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 40-50 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 50-60 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 60-70 in SEQ ID NO;168, amino acids 70-80 in SEQ ID NO:l68, amino acids 80-90 in SEQ ID NO;168, amino acids 90-100 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 100-110 in SEQ ID NO:168, amino acids 110-120 in SEQ ID NO:I68, or amino acids 120-130 in SEQ ID NO:168, as well coiresponding portions of other PLA2 proteins (e.g., PLA2 proteins described above).<br>
Portions of PLA2, as well as portions of other proteins against which an immunological response is sout, suitable for use with the invention may comprise, or alternatively consist of, peptides which are generally at least 6 amino acids in length (e.g.. peptides 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15,18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,75, 80, 85,90,95, or 100 amino acids in length).<br>
PLA2 peptides (e.g., the full length PLA2 proteins discussed above, as well as subportions of each) may also be coupled to any substance (e.g., a Q capsid protein or fragment thereof) which allows for the formation of ordered and repetitive antigen arrays.<br>
In another aspect of the preseait invention, the invention provides compositions being paiticulariy suitable for treating and/or preventing conditions caused or exacerbated by "self gene products.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is RANKL (Receptor activator of NFkB ligand). RANKL is also known as TRANCE (TNF-related activation induced cytokine), ODF (Osteoclast differentiation factor) or OPGL (Osteoprotegerin ligand). TTie amino acid sequence of the extracellular part of human RANKL is shown in SEQ ID No: 221 (RANKL_human: TrEMBL: 014788), while the amino acid sequence of a human isoform is shown in SEQ ID No: 222. Sequences for the extracellular part of murine RANKL and an isoform are shown in SEQ ID No.223 (RANKL_mouse: TrEMBL:035235), and in SEQ ID No.224 (RANKL_mouse spUce forms: TrEMBL:Q9JJK8 and TrEMBL:Q9JJK9), respectively.<br>
It has been shown that RANKL is an essential factor in osteoclastogenesis. Inhibition of the interaction of RANKL with its receptor RANK can lead to a suppression of osteoclastogenesis and thus provide a means to stop excessive bone resorption as seen in osteoporosis and other conditions. The RANKL/RANK interaction was inhibited either by a RANK-Fc fusion protein or the soluble decoy receptor of RANKL, termed osteoprotegerin OPG.<br><br>
In the immune system RANKL is expressed on T cells while RANK is found on antigen-presenting cells. The RANKL-RANK interaction wajs shown to be critical for CD40L-independent T-helper cell activation (Bachmann et al, J. Exp. Med. 7: 1025 (1999)) and enhance the longevity and adjuvant properties of dendritic cells (Josien el al.. J Exp Med. 191:495 (2000)).<br>
In bone RANKL is expressed on stromal cells or osteoblasts, while RANK is expressed on the osteoclast precursor. The interaction of RANK and RANKL is crucial for the development of osteoclast precursors to mature osteoclasts. The interaction can be blocked by osteoprotegerin.<br>
OPG-deficient mice develop osteoporosis tfiat can be rescued by injection of recombinant OPG. Tliis means that OPG is able to reverse osteopOTOsis. Thus, inhibition of the RANK-RANKL interaction by way of injecting this specific embodiment of the invention may reverse osteoporosis.<br>
In addition, arterial calcification was observed in OPG k.o. mice which could be reversed by injection of OPG (Min et al., J. Exp. Med. 4: 463 (2000)). In an adjuvant-induced arthritis model OPG injection was able to prevent bone loss and cartilage destruction, but not inflammation (paw swelling). It is assumed that activated T cells lead to a RANKL-mediated increase of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. OPG inhibits prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis and prevents prostate tumor p-owth in the bone of mice. OPG diminishes advanced bone cancer pain in mice.<br>
RANKL is a transmembrane protein of 245 aa belonging to the TNF-superfamily. Part of the extracellular region (178 aa) can be shed by a TACE-like protease (Lum et al, J Biol Chem. 274:13613 (1999)). In addition splice variants lacking the transmembrane domain have been described (Ikeda et al., Endocrmologyl42: 1419 (2001)). The shed part contains the domain highly homologous to soluble TNF-OL This extracellular domain of RANKL forms homotrimers as seen for TNF-o. The C-terminus seems to be involved in the trimer contact site. One cysteine is present in this region of the sequence.<br>
We have built a model for the 3-4imensional stracture of the corresponding region of RANKL and found that the naturally present cysteine may not be accessible in the folded structure for interaction with a first attachment site on the carrier in accordance with the present invention. The N-tenninus is preferred for attaching a second attachment site comprising an amino acid linker with an additional cysteine residue. A human-RANKL construct with an N tennjnal amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue fused to the extracellular part of RAJNKL is a very preferred embodiment of the invention. However, an amino-acid linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being fused at the C-terminus of the RANKL<br><br>
sequence or the extracellular part of RANKL leads to further preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention.<br>
Human-RANKL constructs, such as the one identified in SEQ ID NO:320, are generated according to the teachings disclosed in EXAMPLE 6, and the man skilled in the art are able to compare murine and human RANKL sequences in a protein sequence alignment to identify the part of the sequence of hunian-RANKL to be cloned in the vectors described in EXAMPLE 6. Bragments containing amino acids 138-317 and corresponding to the C-terminal region of the extracellular domain of human RANKL, are particularly favored embodiments of the invention, and can be modified for coupling to VLPs and PiU as required according to the teaching of the present invention. However, other suitable vectors may also be used for expression in the suitable host described below. Further human-RANKL constructs, and in particular, the ones comprising the part of the extracellular region (178 aa), - or fragments thereof - that can be shed by a TACE-hke protease (Lum et al., J Biol Chem. 274:13613 (1999)), or comprising the sequence corresponding to the alternative splice variants lacking the transmembrane domain, as well as conservative fragments thereof, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Human C-terminal fragments comprising amino acids 165-317 are also embodiments of the invention. Alternatively, fragments which encompass the entire extracellular region (amino acids 71-317) and can be modified for coupling to VLPs and Pili as required according to the teaching of the present mvention, are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
JtANKL has been expressed in different systems (E.coli, insect cells, mammalian cells) and shown to be active, and therefore several expression systems can be used for production of the antigen of the composition. In the case where expression of the protein is directed to the periplasm of E. coli, the signal peptide of RANKL, or of RANKL constructs consisting of the extracellular part of the protein, and both possibly modified to comprise a second attachment site in accordance with the invention, is replaced with a bacterial signal peptide. For expression of the protein in the cytoplasm of E. coli, RANKL constructs are devoid of signal peptide.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is MIF or a fragment thereof. MIF is a cytokine that has been first described in 1966 by its function as an inhibitor of macrophage migration. It is also known as delayed early response protein 6 (DER6), glyoDsylalion inhibiting factor or phenylpyruvate tautomerase. The latter name originates from enzymatic activity of MIF, however the endogenous substrate has not been identified.<br><br>
MIF has been shown to be implicated in a wide range of conditions. MIF (mRNA and protein) is upregulated in delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction induced by tuberculin, and anti-MlF antibody inhibits this DTH reaction. MIF is also upregulated in renal allograft rejection, In a model for ocular autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), anti-MIF treatment caused delay of EAU development. In patients, there is an increase in serum of MIF, which is also the case in Behcet"s disease patients and patients suffering from iridocyclitis. Immunization against MIF may provide a way of treatment against rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
High senmi MIF concentration has been found in atopic dermatitis patients. In skin lesions, MIF is diffusely expressed instead of being found in the bal ceU layer in controls. MIF concentration is decreasing after steroid treatment, consistent with a role of MIF in inflammation. MIF has also been found to contribute to the establishment of glomerulonephritis. Animals treated with anti-MIF Antibody show significantly reduced glomerulonephritis. MIF is pituitary derived, secreted e.g. upon LPS stimulation, and potentiates endotoxemia. Accordingly, anti-MIF mAb inhibits endotoxemia and septic shock, while recombinant MEF markedly increases lethality of peritonitis. MIF is also a glucocorticoid-induced modulator of cytokine production, and promotes inflammation.<br>
MIF is produced by T-cells (Th2), supports proliferation of T-cells, and anti-MIF-treatment reduces T-cell proliferation and IgG levels. There is an increased MIF concentration in the cerebrpspinai fluid of multiple sclerosis and neuro-Behcet" s disease patients. Hgh MTF levels were also found in sera of patients with extended psoriasis. High MIF levels are found in sera of ulcerative colitis patients but not Crohn"s disease patients.<br>
High MCF levels have been found in sera of patients with bronchic asthma. MIF is also upregulated in synovial fluid of iheumatoid arthritis patients. Anti-MIF treatment was effectivly decreasing rfieumatoid arthritis in mouse and rat models (Mikulowska et ai, J. Immunol. ;55:5514-7(1997); Leech et at. Arthritis Rheum. 41:910-1 (1998), Leech et al. Arthntis Rheum. 45:827-33 (2000), Santos et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 725:309-14 (2001)). Thus, treatment directed at inhibiting MIF activity using a composition comprising MIF as an antigenic determinant may be beneficial for the conditions mentioned above.<br><br>
MIF from mouse, rat and human consists of 114 amino acid and contains three conserved cysteines, as shown in SEQ ID No 225 (MlF_rat: SwissProt), in SEQ ID No 226 (MIFmouse: SwissProt) and in SEQ ID No 227 (MIF.human: SwissPiot). Three subunits form a homotrimer that is not stabilized by disulfide bonds. The X-ray structure has been solved and shows three free cysteines (Sun et al, PNAS 93: 5191-96 (1996)), while some litK-ature data claim the presence of a disulfide bond-Nonetheless, none of the cysteines are exposed enough for optimal interaction with 8 possible first attachment site present on the carrier. Thus, as tiie C-terminus of the protein is exposed in the trimer structure, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine residue is, preferably, added at the C-tMminus of the protein, for generation of the second attachment site in this preferred embodiment of the invention, as exemplarily described in EXAMPLE 4 for rat-MIF.<br>
There is only one amino acid change between mouse- and rat-MIF, and similarly a very high sequence homology (about 90 % sequence identity) between human- and rat-MIF or human- and mouse-MIF. Human- and mouse-MIF constructs according to the invention are described and can be generated as disclosed in EXAMPLE 4. Bi order to demonstrate the high potency to induce a self-specific immune response of MIF protein, or fragments thereof, associated to a core particle in accordance with the present invention, rat-MIF constructs coupled to QP capsid protem were injected in mice. The high antibody titers obtained by immunizing mice with rat-MIF show that tolance towards immunization with self-antigens was overcome by immunizing with MIF constructs coupled to virus-like particles, and in particular to QP capsid protein (EXAMPLE 4). Therefore, compositions in accordance with the present invention comprising human-MIF protein associated to a cere particle, preferably to pih or a virus-like particle, and more preferably to a virus¬like particle of a RNA-phage, and even more preferably to RNA-phage Qp or fr, represent VM preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
However, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine that is added at the N-terminus of the sequence of MIF leads to further prefeired embodiments of the present invention. MIF has been expressed in E.coU, purified and shown to be fully functional (Bemhagen et al., Biochemistry 33: 14144-155 (1994). Thus, MIF may be, preferably, expressed in E. coli for generating the preferred embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
Tautomerase activity of MIF is inhibited, if the start methionine is not cleaved from the construct. MIF constructs expressed in Kcoli and described in EXAMPLE 4 show tautomerase activity. Mutants of MIF where the start methionine is cleaved and where the proline residue right after the start methionine in the sequence is mutated to alanine also do not show tautomerase activity represent further embodiments of the invention and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention. B some specific embodiments, immunization with MIF mutants devoid of tautomerase activity is envisaged.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is Interleukin-17 (IL-17). Himian 1117 is a 32-kDa, disulfide-linked, homodimeritJ protein with variable glycosylation (Yao, Z. et al., J. Immunol 155: 5483-5486 (1995); Fossiez, F. et al., J. Exp. Med. 183: 2593-2603 (1996)). The protein comprises 155 amino acids and includes an N-terminal secretion signal sequence of 19-23 residues. The amino acid sequence of IL-17 is similar only to a Herpesvirus protein (HSV13) and is not similar to other cytokines or known proteins. The amino acid sequence of human IL-17 is shown in SEQ ID No: 228 (ACCESSION #: AAC50341), The mouse protein sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 229 (ACCESSION #: AAA37490). Of die large number of tissues and cell lines evaluated, the mRNA transcript encodingE17 has been detected only in activatedT cells and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Yao, Z. et al., J. Immunol. 155: 5483-5486 (1995); Fossiez, F. et al., J. Exp. Med. 183: 2593-2603 (1996)). Botii human and mouse sequences contain 6 cysteine residues.<br>
The receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed in many tissues and cell types (Yao, Z. etal. Cytokine 9: 794-800 (1997)). Although the amino acid sequence of the human IL-17 receptor (866 aa) predicts a protein with a single trans-membrane domain and a long, 525 aa intracellular domain, the realtor sequence is unique and is not similar to that of any of the receptors from the cytokine/growth factor receptor family. This coupled with the lack of similarity of IL-17 itself to other known proteins indicates that IL-17 and its receptor may be part of a novel family of signalling protein and receptors. Clinical stu(es intcate IL-17 may be involved in many inflammatory diseases. IL-17 is secreted by synovial T cells fixjm ibeumatoid arthritis patients and stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators (Chabaud, M. et al., /. Immunol. 161: 409-414 (1998); Chabaud, M. et al., Arthntis Rheum. 42: 963-970 (1999)). H levels of 1117 have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ZiolkowskaM.e/aZ.,J/mmurao/. 7(5:2832-8(2000)).<br>
	Interleukjn 17 has been shown to have an effect on proteoglycan degradation<br>
in murine knee joints (Dudler J. et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 59: 529-32 (2000)) and contribute to destruction of the synovium matrix (Chabaud M. et al., Cytoidne. i2:1092-9 (2000)). There are relevant arthritis models in animals for testing the effect of an immunization against MIF (Chabaud M. et al, Cytoidne. i2:1092-9 (2000)). Elevated levels of IL-17 mRNA have been found in mononuclear cells from patients with multiple sclerosis (Matusevicius, D. et al.. Mult. Scler. 5: 101-104 (1999)). Elevated serum levels of IL-17 are observed in patients suffering Systemic Lupus Eythematosus (Wong CX. et al.. Lupus 9: 589-93 (2000)). In addition, IL-17 mRKA levels are increased in T cells isolated from lesional psoriatic skin (Teunissen, M. B. et al. J. Invest. Dermatol 111: 645-649 (1998)).<br>
The involvement of IL-17 in rejection of kidney graft has also been demonstrated (Fossiez F. et al.. Int. Rev. Immunol 16:541-51 (1998)). Evidence for a role of IL-17 in organ allograft rejection has also been presented by Antonysamy et al. (J. Immunol 162:577-84 (1999)) who showed IL-17 promotes the fimctional differentiation of dendritic cell progenitors. Their findings suggest a role for IL--17 in allogeneic T cell proliferation that may be mediated in part via a maturation-inducing effect on DCs. Furthermore the same group reports (Tang J.L. et al. Transplantation 72:348-50 ( 2001)) a role for IL-17 in the immunopathogenesis of acute vascular rejection where Interleukin-17 antagonism inhibits acute but not chronic vascular rejection. IL-17 appears to have potential as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in allograft rejection.<br>
The above findings suggest IL-17 may play a pivotal role in the initiation or maintenance of an inflammatory response (Jovanovic; D. V. et al., J. lnmunol. 160: 3513-3521 (1998)).<br>
The anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody mAb5 (Schering-Plough Research Institute) was able to completely inhibit the production of IL-6 Irom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium supematants following induction by 50 ng/ml of IL-17. An irrelevant mAb MXl had no effect in this assay. mAb5 is a mouse IgGl obtained after immunization with human rIL-17 (r = recombinant). A concentration of 1 p,g/ml of mAb5 was able to completely inhibit the IL-6 production in the assay system (Chabaud, M. et al., J. Immunol 161: 409-14 (1998)). Thus, immunization against IL-17 provides a way of treatment for the various conditions described above.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, thus, the composition comprises a linker containing a second attachment site and being fused to the C-terminus of recombinant IL-17. In further prefared embodiments of the invention, however, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-taminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the<br><br>
signal peptide. For eukaryotic expression systems, the signal peptide of the IL-17 gene, as it is the case for the other self-antigens indicated herein, may be replaced by another signal peptide if required. For expression in bacteria, the signal peptide is either replaced by a bacterial signal peptide for soluble expression in the periplasm, or deleted for expression in the cytoplasm. Constructs of human IL-17 devoid of signal peptide will preferably comprise residues 24-155, 22-155, 21-155 or 20-155. Constructs of mouse IL-17 devoid of signal peptide will preferably comprise residues 26-158, 25-158, 24-158 or 27-155. Human IL-17 may be expressed in CVl/EBNA cells; recomlanant hIL-17 has been shown to be secreted in both glycosylated and nonglycosylated fonns (Yao, Z. et al., J. Immunol. 155: 5483-5486 (1995)). IL-17 can also be expressed as hIL-17/Fc fusion protein, with subsequent cleavage of the IL-17 protein from the fusion protein. IL-17 may also be expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris (Murphy K.P. et. al.. Protein Expr Purif. 12: 208-14 (1998)). Human IL-17 may also be expressed in E. coll. When expression of IL-17 in E. coli is directed to the periplasm, the signal peptide of IL-17 is replaced by a bacterial signal peptide. For expression of the protein in the cytoplasm of E. coli, IL-17 constructs are devoid of signal peptide.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the antinic detraminant is Interleukin-13 CIL-13). IL-13 is a cytokine that is secreted by activated T lymphocytes and primarily impacts monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. The amino acid sequence of precursor human IL-13 is shown in SEQ ID No: 230 and the amino acid sequence of processed human IL-13 is shown in SEQ ED No: 231. The first 20 amino acids of the precursor protein correspond to the signal peptide, and are absent of the processed protein. The mouse sequence has also been described, and the processed amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 232 (Brown K.D. et al.. J. Immunol. 142:619-681 (1989)). Depending on the expression host, the IL-13 construct will comprise the sequence of the precursor protein, e.g. for expression and secretion in eukaryotic hosts, or consist of the mature protein, e.g. for cytoplasmic expression in E.coli. For expression in the periplasm of E. coli, the signal peptide of IL-13 is replaced by a bacterial signal peptide.<br>
IL-13 is a T helper 2-derived cytokine (like IL-4, K5) that has recently been implicated in allergic airway responses (asthma). Upregulation of IL-13 and IL-13 -receptor has been found in many tumour types (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma). Interleukin 13 is secreted by and stimulates the growth of Hodgkin and Reed-Stemberg cells (Kapp U et al, J Exp Med. 189:1939A6 (1999)). Thus, immunization against IL-13 provides a way of treating among others the conditions described above, such as Asthma or Hodgkins Lymphoma.<br><br>
preferably, the composition comprises an amino add linker containing a free cysteine residue and being fused to the N or C-tenninus of the sequence of mature IL-13 to introduce a second attachment site within the protein. In further preferred embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is added to the N-tenninus of the mature form of IL-13, since it is freely accessible according to the NMR structure of IL-13 (Eisenmesser, E. Z. ei at., J.MolBiol 310: 231 (2001)). In again further preferred embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-tenninus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide. In still further preferred embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine residue is added to the C-terminus of the protein.<br>
IL-13 may be expressed in E.coli CEisenmesser E.Z. el al.. Protein Ejqir. Purif. 20:lS6-95 (2000)), or in NS-0 cells (eukaryotic cell line) (Cannon-Carlson S. et al, Protein Expr. Purif. 12:239AS (1998)). EXAMPLE 9 describes constructs and expression of constructs of murine IL-13, fused to an amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue, in bacterial and eukaryotic hosts.Human IL-13 constructs can be generated according to the teachings of EXAMPLE 9 and yielding the proteins human C-IL-13-F (SBQ ID NO:330) and human C-IH3-S (SEQ ID NO:331) after expression of the fusion proteins and cleavage with Factor Xa, and enterokinase respectively. The so generated proteins can be coupled to VLPs and Pili, leading to preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is Interleukin-5 (IL-5). IL-5 is a lineage-specific cytokine for eosinophilopoiesis and plays an important part in diseases associated with increased number of eosinophils, such as asthma. The sequence of precursor and processed human IL-5 is provided in SEQ ID No: 233 and in SEQ ID No: 234, respectively, and the processed mouse amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ED No: 235,<br>
The biological function of IL-5 has been shown in several studies (Coffman R.L. et al.. Science 245: 308-10 (1989); Kopf et al.. Immunity 4:15-24 (1996)), which point to a beneficial effect of inhibiting IL-5 function in diseases mediated through eosinophils. Inhibition of the action of IL-5 provides thus a way of treatment against asthma and other diseases associated with eosinophils.<br>
IL-5 forms a dimer, covalentiy linked by a disulfide bridge. A singje chain (sc) construct has been reported wherein two monomers of IL-5 are linked by a peptide linker.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, a peptide linker containing a free cysteine is added at the N-terminus of the sequence of the processed form of IL-5.<br><br>
Addition of a linker containing a free cysteine is also, preferably, envisaged at the N-terminus of the sequence of the processed foim of a scIL-5. In further preferred embodiments, the amino acid Hnker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-tenniniis of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.<br>
In again further preferred embodiments, a linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the C- teiminus of the sequence of IL-5, or to the C-terminus of a scIL-5 sequence.<br>
A number of expression systems have been described for IL-5 and can be used in preparing the compositions of the invention. A bacterial expression system using E.coa has been described by Proudfoot et al, (Biochem J. 270:357-61 (1990)). In the case where IL-5 is expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coh, the IL-5 construct is devoid of a signal peptide. Insect cells may also be used for producing IL-5 constracts for making the compositions of the invention (Pierrot C. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 255:756-60 (1998)). Likewise, Baculovirus expression systems (sf9 cells; higley E. et al.. Eur. J. Biochem. 196:623-9 (1991) and Brown P.M. et al.. Protein Expr. Purif. 6: 63-71 (1995)) can also be used. Hnally, mammalian expression systems have also been reported (CHO cells) and can be used in preparing these compositions of the invention (Kodama S et al., J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 110:693-701 (1991)).<br>
Baculovirus expression systems CCtchell et al, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 27:332S (1993); Kunimoto DY et al. Cytokine 5:224-30 (1991)) and a mammalian cell expression system using CHO cells (Kodama S et al., Glycobiology 2:419-27 (i992)) have also been described for mouse IL-5.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 describes the expression of murine IL-5 coiwtructs wherein the IL-5 sequence is fused at its N-terminus to amino acid linkers containing a cysteine residue for coupling to VLPs and Pili. Human constructs can be generated according to the teaching of EXAMPLE 10 and yield the proteins human C-IL-5-E (SEQ ID NO:335), human C-ES-F (SEQ ID NO:336) and human C-IL-5-S: (SEQ ID NO:337) suitable for coupling to VLPs and PUi and leading to preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
Jn another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is CCL-21. CCL-21 is a chemokine of the CC subfamily that is also known as small inducable cytokine A21, as exodus-2, as SLD (secondary lynhocyte cytokine), as TCA4 (thymus-deiived chemotactic agent 4) or 6Ckine.<br><br>
CCL21 inhibitis hemopoiesis and stimulates chemotaxis for thymocytes, activated T-cells and dendritic cells, but not for B cells, macrophages or neutrophiles. It shows preferential activitiy towards naive T cells. It is also a potent mesangial cell chemoattractant CCL2i binds to chemokine receptors CCR7 and to CXCR3 (dependent on species). It can trigger rapid integrin-dependent arrest of lymphocytes rolling under physiological shear and is highly expressed by high endothelial venules.<br>
Murine CCL21 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in a human lung cancer SCID mouse model (Arenberg et al.. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 49: 587-92 (2001)) and a colon carcinoma tumor model in mice (Vicari et al., J. Immunol. 165: 1992-2000 (2001)). The anostatic activity of murine CCL21 was also detected in a rat corneal micropocket assay (Soto et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA95: 8205-10 (1998).<br>
It has been shown that chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 are upregulated in breast cancer cells and that CCL21 and CXCL12, the respective ligands, are highly expressed in organs representing the first destinations of breast cancer metastasis MtiUer et al. (Nature 410: 50-6 (2001)). In vitro CCL21-mediated chemotaxis could be blocked by neutrali2dng anti-CCL21 antibodies as was CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis by the respective antibodies. Thus, immunization against CCL21 provides a way of treatment against metastatis spread in cancers, more specifically in breast cancer.<br>
Secreted CCL21 consist of 110 or HI aa in mice and humans, respectively. The respective sequences ace shown in SEQ ID No: 236 (Swissprot: SY21_human) and in SEQ ID No: 237 (Swissprot: SY21_mouse). In contrast to other CC cytokines does CCL21 contain two more cysteines within an extended region at the C-tenninus. It is assumed that all cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds.<br>
In the following, constructs and expression systems are described for making compositions of the invention comprising the CCL21 antigenic determinant In the NMR structure of the homologous protein eotaxin, both N- and C-traminus are exposed to the solvent. In some specific embodiments, an amino acid linkra" containing a free cysteine residue as a second attachment site is added at the C-terminus of the protein. A fusion protein with alkaline phosphatase (at the C-terminus of CCL21) has been expressed and was shown to be functional, showing that fusions at the C-terminus of CCL21 are compatible with receptor binding. In other specific embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a fi-ee cysteine is fused to the N-teaminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-termrnus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.<br><br>
Several expression systems have been described for production of CCL21 (e.g. Hedrick et al., J Immunol. 159: 1589-93 (1997)). For example, it may expressed inabaculovirussystem(Nagiraetal.,/. Biol. Chem. 272:19518-24(1997)).<br>
In a related preferred embodiment, the antigenic determinant is Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), now termed CXCL12. CXCL12 is a chemoldne produced by bone marrow stromal cells and was originally identified as a stimulatory factor for pre-B cells.<br>
As already stated above, it has been shown that chranokire receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 are upregulated in breast cancer cells and that CCI-21 and SDF-1, the respective ligands, are highly expressed in organs representing the first destinations of breast cancer metastasis Miiller et al. (Nature 410: 50-6 (2001)). In vitro SDF-1 / CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis could be inhibitied by neutralizing anti-SDF-1 and anti-CXCR4 antibodies.<br>
In a breast cancer metastasis model in SCID mice using the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, a sigmficant decrease in lung metastasis was observed when mice were treated with anti-CXCR4 antibodies. In the draining lymph nodes a reduction of metastasis to the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes (38% instead of 100% metastasis in controls) was observed. Thus, immunization against CXCL12 provides a way of treatment against metastatis of cancers, more specifically of breast cancers.<br>
The SDF-1 / CXCR4 chemokine-receptor pair has been shown to increase the efficacy of homing of more primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells to be bone marrow. In addition, CXCR4 and SDF-1 are supposed to influence the distribution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. These cells invariably infiltrate the bone marrow of patients and it was shown that their migration in the bone manow was CXCR4 dependent. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells undergo optosis unless they are cocultured with stiomal cells. SDF-i blocking antibodies could inhibit this protective effect of stromal cells (Burger et al.. Blood 96: 2655-63 (2000)). Immunizing against CXCH2 thus provides a way of treatment against chronic lymphocytic leukemia.<br>
CXCR4 has been shown to be a coreceptor for entry of HIV into T-cells. SDF-1 inhibits infection of CD4+ cells by X4 (CXCR4-dependent) HIV sQns (Oberiin et al., Nature 382-.833-5 (1996); Bleui et al., Nature 3S2;829-33 (1996), Rusconi et al., Antivir. TJier. 5:199-204 (2000)). Synthetic peptide analogs of SDF-1 have been shown to effectively inhibit HIV-1 entry and infection via the CXCR4 receptor(WO059928Al). Thus, immunization against CXCL12 provides a way to block HIV entry in T-cells, and therefore a way of treating AIDS.<br>
SDF-1-CXCR4 interactions were also reported to play a central role in CD4+ T  cell   accumulation in riieumatoid  arthritis  synovium (Nanki  et  al.,  2000).<br><br>
Inununization against SDF-1 thus provides a way of treatment against rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Human and murine SDF-l are known to arise in two fonns, SDF-la and SDF-ip, by difTerential splicing from a single gene. They differ in four C-terminal amino acids that are present in SDF-lp (74 aa) and absent in SDF-la (70 aa). The sequence of human is shown in SEQ ID No: 238 (Swissprot: SDFl_human) and the sequence mouse SDF-1 is shown in SEQ ID No: 239 (Swissprot SDFl_mouse). SDF-1 contains four conserved cysteines that form two ihtra-molecular disulfide bonds. The crystal structure of SDF shows a, non covalently-Iinked dimer (Dealwis et al. PNAS 95:6941-46 (1998)). The SDF-1 structure also shows a long N-terminal extension.<br>
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify (part of) the receptor-binding site on SDF-1 (Ohnishi et al, J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 20: 691-700 (2000)) and Elisseeva et al (J. Biol Chem. 275:26799-805 (2000)) and Heveker et al. {Curr. Biol 5:369-76 (1998)) described SDF-1 derived peptides inhibiting receptor binding (and HTV entry).<br>
In the following, constructs and expression systems suitable in the generation of the compositions of the invention related to SDF-1 are described. Tlie N- and C-terminus of SDF-1 are exposed to the solvent. In specific embodiments, an amino add linka: containing a cysteine as second attachment site is thus fused to the C-terminus of the protein sequence, while in other specific embodiments an amino acid linker containing a cysteine as second attachment site is fused to the N-terminus of the protein sequence. The amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-tenninally of the signal [Kptide.The genes coding for these specific constructs may be cloned in a suitable expression vector.<br>
Expression of SDF-1 in a sendai virus system in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (Moriya et al.. FEBS Lett. "#25:105-11 (1998)) has been described as well as expression in E.coU (Hohnes et al., Prot. Ejr. Purif. 21: 367-77 (2001)) and chemical synthesis of SDF-1 (Dealwis et al, PNAS 95: 6941-46 (2001)).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is BLC. B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC, CXCL13) is expressed in die spleen, Peyer"s patches and lymph nodes (Gunn et al., 1998). Its expression is strongest in the germinal centres, where B cells undergo somatic mutation and affinity maturation. It belongs to the CXC chemokine family, and its closest homolog is GROa_(Gunn et al, Nature 391:799-803 (1998)). Human BLC is 64% homologous to murine BLC. Its receptor is CXCR5. BLC also shares homology with IL-8. BLC recruits B-cells to follicles in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and peyer"s patches, BLC is<br><br>
also required for recruitment of B-cells to compartment of the lymph nodes rich in follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) (Ansel et al.. Nature 406:309-314 (2000)). BLC also induces increased expression of Lymphotoxinaip2 (LT?aip2) on the recruited B-cells. This provides a positive feed-back loop, since LT?aip2 promotes BLC expression (Ansel et al. Nature ■#05:309-314 (2000)). BLC has also been shown to be able to induce lymphoid neogenesis (Luther et al.. Immunity 72:471-481(2000)). It appears that FDCs also express BLC. Thus immunization against BLC may provide a way of treatment against autoimmune diseases where lymphoid neogenesis is involved, such as Rheumatoid synovitis and Rheumatoid arthritis or Type I diabetes. A construct of BLC bearing a C-terminal his-tag has been described, and is functional (Ansel, K.M. etal., J. Exp. Med. 190: 1123-1134 (1999)).<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the composition comprises a linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being fused at the C-tenninus of the BLC sequence.<br>
In IL-8, which is homologous to BLC, both N- and C-termini are free. In a further preferred embodiraent, addition of an amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site is, therefore, done to the N-tenninus of BLC for generation of this specific composition of the invention.<br>
In further preferred embodiments of the present invention, the composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine and being fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminaliy of the signal peptide. The genes coding for these specific constructs may be cloned in a suitable expression vector and expressed accordingly. The sequence of human BLC is shown in SEQ ID No: 240 (Accession: NP_006410). Amino acids 1-22 of the sequence are the signal peptide. The mouse sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 241 (AccKsion NP_061354). Amino acids 1-21 are the signal peptide. Compositions of the invention with BLC as the antigenic determinant, preferably, use the mature fonn of the protein for generating the compositions of the invention.<br>
hi another specific embodiment, the antigenic detenninant is Eotaxin. Eotaxin is a chemokine specific for Chemokine receptor 3, present on eosinophils, basophils and Th2 cells. Eotaxin seems however to be highly specific for Eosinophils itnmennan et al, J. Immunol 165: 5839-46 (2000)). Eosinophil migration is reduced by 70% in the eotaxin-1 knock-out mouse, which however can still develop eosinophilia (Rothenberg et al., J. Exp. Med. 185: 785-90 (1997)). IL-5 seems to be responsible for the migration of eosinophils fix)m bone-marrow to blood, and eotaxin for the local migration in the tissue (Humbles et al, J. Exp. Med. 186: 601-12 (1997)).<br><br>
ine numan genome uoniains :&gt; eotaxin genes, eotaxjni-3. They share 30% homology to each other. Two genes are known so far in the mouse: eotaxin 1 and eotaxin 2 (Zimmerman et al., I immunol 165: 5839-46 (2000)). They share 38% homology. Murine eotaxin-2 shares 59% homology with human eotaxin-2. hi the mouse, eotaxin-1 seems to be ubiquitously expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract, while eotaxin-2 seems to be predominantly expressed in the jejunum (Zimmerman et al, J. Immunol 165: 5839-46 (2000)). Eotaxin-1 is present jn broncho-alveolar fluid (Teixeira et al., J. Clin. Invest. 100: 1657-66 (1997)). Tlie sequence of human eotaxin-1 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 242 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide), the sequence of human eotaxin-2 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 243 (aa 1-26 corresponds to the signal peptide), the sequence of human eotaxin-3 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 244 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide), the sequence of mouse eotaxin-1 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 245 (aa 1-23 corresponds to the signal peptide), and the sequence of mouse eotaxin-2 is shown in SEQ ID No.: 246 (aa 1-23 COTresponds to the signal peptide).<br>
Eotaxin has a MW of 8.3 kDa. It is in equilibrium between monomers and dimers over a wide range of conditions, witii an estimated Kd of 1.3 mM at 37""C (Cramp et al., J. Biol Chem. "273: 22471-9 (1998)). The monomer fonn is however predominant Tlie structure of Eotaxin has been elucidated by NMR spectroscopy. Binding site to its receptor CCR3 is at the N-tenninus, and the region preceding the first cysteine is cracial (Crump et al., J. Biol Chem. 273: 22471-9 (1998)). Peptides of chemoldne receptors bound to Eotaxin confirmed this finding. Eotaxin has four cysteines forming two disulfide bridges. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the inventive composition conqirises an amino-acid linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being, preferably, fused to the C-tMminus of the Eotaxin sequence. In other preferred embodiments, an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine is fused to the N-tenninus of the sequence conesponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-tenninus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide. The genes coding for these specific constructs arc cloned in a suitable expression vector.<br>
Eotaxin can be chemically synthesized (Qark-Lewis et al.. Biochemistry 30:3128-3135 (1991)). Expression in E. coli has also been described for Eotaxin-1, in the cytoplasm (Crump et al.. J. Biol Chem. 273: 22471-9 (1998)). Expression in E. coli as inclusion bodies with subsequent refolding (Mayer et al. Biochemistry 39: 8382-95 (2000)), and iisect ceU expression (Forssmann et al., J. Exp. Med. 185: 2171-6 (1997)) have been described for Eotaxin-2, and may, moreover, be used to arrive at the specific embodiments of the invention.<br>
Jn yet another specific embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). M-CSF or CSF-1 is a<br><br>
regulator of proliferation, differentiation and survival of macrophages and their bonc" manow progenitors. The receptor for M-CSF is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, encoded by the protooncxigene cfins. An elevated expression of M-CSF and its receptor has been associated with poor prognosis in several epithelial cancers such as breast, uterine and ovarian cancer. Tumor progression has been studied in a mouse strain resulting from the crossing of a transgenic mouse susceptible to mammary cancer (PyMT) with a mouse containing a recessive null mutation in csf-I gene. TTiese mice show attenuated late stage invasive carcinoma and pulmonary metastasis compared to the PyMT mouse (Lin et aJ., J. Exp. Med. 193:127-739 (2001)). The cause seems to be the absence of macrophage recruitment to neoplastic tissues-Subcutaneous growth of Lewis lung cancer is also impaired in csf.l null mice. It is postulated that the mecamsm of macrophage enhancement of tumor growth would be ttirough angiogenic factora, growth factors and proteases produced by the macrophages.<br>
Structural data on the soluble form of M-CSF are available (crystal structure: Pandit et al.. Science 25S:1358-*2 (1992)), and show that both the N- and C-termini of the iffotein are accessible. However, the N-tenninus is close to the site of interaction with the receptor. In addition, M-CSF is present both in a soluble and cell surface form, where the transmembrane region is at its C-terminus. llierefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a cysteine and being, preferably, added at the C-terminus of M-CSF or fragments thereof, or preferably at the C-terminus of the soluble form of M-CSF. In furtho: preferred embodiments, the amino acid Unker containir a free cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed,protein or of the soluble form of the protein, or inserted at the N-terminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein or of the soluble form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide. M-CSF is a dimer, where the two monomers are linked via an interchain disulfide bridge.<br>
An expression system in E. coli has been described for an N-tenninal 149 amino acid fragment (functional) of M-CSF (Koths et al., Mol. Reprod. Dev. 46:31-yi (1997)). This fragment of M-CSF, preferably modified as outlined above, represents a preferred antigenic determinant in accordance with the invention.<br>
The human sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 247 (Accession: NP_000748). Further preferred antigenic determinants of the present invention comprise the N-tetminal fragment consisting of residue 33 -181 or 33 -185 of SEQ ID No: 247, corresponding to the soluble form of the receptor.<br>
The mouse sequence (Accession. NP_031804) is shown in sequence ID No: 248- The mature sequence starts at amino acid 33. Thus, a preferred antigenic<br><br>
determinant in accordance with the present invention comprises amino-acid 33 -181 or 33-185.<br>
In another specific embodiment, the antigenic determinant is Resistin (Res). Passive immunization studies were performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against a fusion protein of mouse Resistin (mRes) fused to GST, expressed in bacteria. This passive immunizaticn lead to improved glucose uptake in an animal obesity/ Type H diabetes model (Steppan et al.. Nature 409: 307-12 (2001)).<br>
Resistin (Res) is a 114 aa peptide hormone of approximately 12 KD. It contains 11 cysteine of which the most N-tenninal one was shown to be responsible for the dimerisation of the protein and the other 10 are beheved to be involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds (Banerjee and Lazar, X Biol. Chem. 276: 25970-3 (2001)). Mutation of the first cysteine to alanine abolishes the dimerisation of mRes.<br>
It was shown, that mRes with a FLAG tag at its C-tenninus still rranains active in an animal model (Steppan et al.. Nature 409: 307-12 (2001)), similarly a C-tenninally HA taged (Haemagglutinin tag) version of resistin was shown to be active in a tissue culture assay (Kim et al, J. Biol. Chem. 276: 11252-6 (2001)), suggesting that the C-tenninus is not veay sensitive to introduced modifications. Thus, in a prafened embodiment, the inventive composition comprises an amino-acjd linker containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and being fused at the C-terminus of the resistin sequence, in further prefened embodiments, the amino acid linker containing a fi:ee cysteine is fused to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the processed protein, or inserted at the N-traminus of the sequence of the mature form of the protein, C-terminally of the signal peptide.<br>
For a preferred embodiment of the present invention, MRes or huRes may also be expressed as Fc fusion molecules with a protease cleavage site inserted between Resistin and the Fc part of the construct, preferably C-terminaUy of one or more cysteine residue of the hinge region of the Fc part of the fusion protein in a eukaryotic expression system, or more preferably according to the descriptions and disclosures of EXAMPLE 2. Cleavage of the fusion protein releases Resistin additionally ccnnising either an aminoacid linker containing a cysteine residue as described in EXAMPLE 2, or part or all of the hinge region of the Fc part of the fusion protein which comprises a cysteine residue at its C-terminus, which is suitable for coupling to VLPs or Pili. The human Resistin sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 249 (Accession AF323081). The mouse sequence is shown in SEQ ID No: 250 (Accession AF323080). A favored embodiment of the invention is human resistin protein fused at its C-terminus to an amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue. Human resistin construct can be genorated according to the teachings disclosed in EXAMPLE 2, and by comparing murine and human Resistin sequences m a protein<br><br>

sequence alignment to identify the part of the sequence of human Resistin to be cloned in the vectors described in EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE 2 according to the teachings of EXAMPLE 2, or in other suitable expression vectors. Example of human resistin constructs suitable for generating compositions of the inventions are human resistin-C-Xa: (SEQ ID NO:325), human resistin-C-EK: (SEQ ID NO:326) and human resistin-C: (SEQ ID NO:327).<br>
Human Resistin constructs so genraated are a preferred embodiment of the invention. Vaccination against Resistin using the aforementioned compositions of the invention may thus provide a way of treating Type II Diabetes and obesity.<br>
In another embodiment the antigenic determinant is Lymphotoxin-p. Immunization against lymphotoxin-p may be useful in treating Prion mediated disease. Scrapie (a prion-mediated disease) agent repMcation is believed to take mainly place in lymphoid tissues and was shown to depend on prion-protein expressing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (Brown er aZ., Atoure Afed. 11: 1308-1312 (1999)). It was subsequently shown that mice lacking flmctional follicular dendrite cells show an impaired prion rephcation in spleens and a (small) retardation of neuroinvasion (Montrasio et al.. Science 288: 1257-1259 (2000)). This was achieved by injecting the mice with a soluble lymphotoxin-P receptor-Fc-fusion protein (LTR-Fc). This soluble receptor construct inhibits the development of FDCs by interfering with the crucial interaction of lymphotoxin-p on T, B or NK cells with the lymphotoxin-p receptor on the FDC precursor cells. TTius, vaccination against lymphotoxin-P (also called TNFy) may provide a vaccine for treatment or prevention of Creutzfeld-Jakob (variant form) or other prion-mediated diseases and thus prevent prion replication and neuroinvasion.<br>
Immunization against Lymphotoxin-P may also provide a way of treating diabetes. Transgene expression of soluble LTR-Fc fusion protein in nonobese diabetic NOD mice blocked diabetes development but not insulitis (Ettingar et al., J. Exp. Med. 193: 13330 K (2001)). Wu et al. (J. Exp. Med. 193: 1327-32 (2001)) also used NOD mice to study the involvement of lymphotoxin-p, but instead of transgenic animals they did inject the LTPR-Fc fusion protein. They saw a strong inhibition of diabetes development and inhibition of insulitis. Most interestingly, they could even reverse preexisting insulitis by the fusion protein treatment In the pancreas the formation of lymphoid follicular structures could thus be reversed. Vaccination against lymphotoxin-P may thus provide a way of treatment against tje-I diabetes.<br>
The sequence of the extracellular domain of human lymphotoxin-P is shown in SEQ ID No: 250 (TNFC_human) and the sequence of the extracellular domain of murine lymphotoxin-p is shown in SEQ ID No: 251 (TNFC_mouse).<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the inventive composition comprises an amino acid linker containing a free cysteine and being added to the N-terminus of the sequence corresponding to the processed form of lymphotoxin-P, or inserted between the N-teiminus of the sequence corresponding to the mature form of the protein, and the signal peptide, C-tenninally to the signal peptide. Jxi further preferred embodiments of the invention, the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-P is expressed as a fusion protein either with Glutathion-S-transferase, fused N-terminally to lymphotoxin-P, or with a 6 histidine-tag followed by a myc-tag, fused again N-terminally to the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-p. An amino acid spacer containing a protease cleavage site as well as a Unker sequence containing a free cysteine as attachment site, C-temiinaUy to the protease cleavage site, are fused to the N-terminus of the sequence of the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-P. Preferably, the extracellular part of iynhotoxin-p consists of fragments corresponding to amino acids 49-306 or 126-306 of lymphotoxin-P. These specific consitions of the invention may be cloned and expressed in the pCEP~Pu eukaryotic vector. In further preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions comprise an aminoacid Unker containing a free cysteine residue suitable as second attachment site, and being fused to the C-tenninus of lymphotoxin-P or lymphotoxin-p fragments. In a particularly favored embodiment, the amino acid sequence LACGG, compiising the amino acid linker ACGG which itself contains a cysteine residue for coupling to VLPS and Pili is fused to the N-tenninus of the extracellular part of lymphotoxin-p ; or of a fragment of the extracellular part of lymphotoxia-p, yielding the proteins human C-LT* 49.306 (SEQ ID NO:346) and human C-LT* 126-306 (SEQ ID NO:347) after cleavage with enterokinase of the corresponding fusion proteins expressed rather in vector pCEP-SP-GST-EK or vector pCP-SP-his-myc-EK as described in EXAMPLE 3.<br>

bi a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic determinant is tumor necrosis factor a (TNFHX), fragments thereof or peptides of TNF-a. In particular, peptides or fragments of TNF-a can be used to induce a self-specific immune response directed towards the whole protein by immunizing a human or an animal with vaccines and compositions, respectively, comprising such peptides or fragments in accordance with the invention. Preferably, VLPs, bacteriophages of bacterial pili are used as core particle, to which TNF-a, peptides or fragments thereof are attached according to the invention.<br>
The following murine peptides are the murine homologs to human peptides that have been shown to be bound by antibodies neutralizing the activity of TNF-ot(Yone et al J. Biol. Chem.270: 19509-19515) and were, in a further preferred embodiment of the invention, modified with cysteine residues for coupling to VLPs, bacteriophages or bacterial pili.<br>
MuTNFa peptide: the sequence CGG was added at the N-terminus of the epitope consisting of amino acid residues 22-32 of mature murine TNF-cc: CGGVEEQIWLSQR.<br>

The corresponding human sequence of the 4-22 epitope is SSRTPSDKPVAHWANPQAEGQ. like for the murine sequence a cysteine is, preferably, fused at the N-tenninus of the epitope, or the sequence GGC is fused at the C-terminus of the epitope for covalent coupling to VLPs, bacteriophages or bacterial pili according to the invention. It is, however, within the scope of the present invention that other cysteine containing sequences are fused at the N- or C-termini of the epitopes. In general, one or two glycine residues are preferably inserted between the added cysteine residue and the sequence of the epitope. Other amino acids may, however, also be inserted instead of glycine residues, and these amino acid residues will preferably be small amino acids such as serine.<br>
Tlie human sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 22-32 is QLQWLNRRANA. Preferably, the sequence CGG is fused at the N-terminus of the epitope for covalent coupling to VLPs or bacterial pili according to the invention. Other TNF-cc_epitopes suitable for using in the present invention have been described and are disclosed for example by Yone el a/. (J.Biol. Chem.270: 19509-19515).<br>
The invention further includes compositions which contain mimotopes of the antigens or antigenic determinants described herein.<br>
The specific composition of the invention comprises an antibody or preferably an antibody fragment presented on a virus-like particle or pjlus for induction of an immune rraponse against said antibody. Antibodies or antibody fragments which are produced by lymphoma cells, may be selected for attachment to the virus-like particle and immunization, in order to induce a protective immune response against the lymphoma.<br>
In other further embodiments, an antibody or antibody fragment mimicking an antigen is attached to the particle. The mimicking antibody or antibody fragment may be generated by immunization and subsequent isolation of the mimicking antibody or antibody fragment by any known method known to the art such as e.g. hybridoma technology (Gherardi, E. et al., J. Inmiunol. Metiiods 126; 61-68 (1990)), phage display (Harrison et al. Methods Enzymol. 267: 83-109 (1996)), ribosome display (Hanes, J. et al, Nat. Biotedmol 18: 1287-1292 (2000), yeast two-hybrid (Visintin, M.etal.,Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA96: 11723-11728 (1999)), yeast surface display (Boder, ET. &amp; Wittrup, KD. Methods. Enzym. 328:430-444 (2000)), bacterial surface display (Daugherty, PS. et al.. Protein Eng. 12: 613-621 (1999)). The mimicking<br><br>
antibody may also be isolated from an antibody library or a nmVe antibody library using methods known to the art such as the methods mentioned above, for example.<br>
hi a further embodiment, an antibody recognizing the combining site of another antibody, i.e. an anti-idiotypic antibody, further called the immunizing antibody, may be used. The antibody recognized by the and-idiotypic antibody will be further referred to as the neutralizing antibody. Tims, by immunizing against the anti-idiotypic antibody, molecules wilh the specificity of fee neutralizing antibody are genered in situ; we will further refer to these generated antibodies as the induced antibodies. In anothest preferred embodiment, the immunizing antibody is selected to interact with a Ugand molecule of the target molecule against which immunization is seeked. The Egand molecule nmy be any molecule interacting with the farg molecule, but will preferentially interact with the site of the target molecule against which antibodies should be generated for inhibition of its function. The ligand molecule may be a natm ligand of the target molecule, or may be any engineered, designed or isolated Mgand having suitable binding properties.<br>
The immunizing antibodies may be of human origin, such as isolated from a naive or inmiune human antibody library, or may have been isolated from a Ubrary generated from another animal source, for example of murine origin.<br>
Coupling of the antibody or antibody fragment to the VLP cff pilus is achieved either by limited reduction of exposed disulfide bridges (for example of the interchain disulfide bridge between CHI and CK or C in a Fab fragment) or by fusion of a linker containing a fi-ee cysteine residue at the C-terminus of the antibody or antibody fragment. In a further embodiment, a linker containing a free cysteine residue is fused to the N-terminus of the antibody or antibody fragment for attachment to a VIP or pilus protein.<br>
A number of vaccine compositions which employ mimotopes are known in the art, as are methods for generating and identifying mimotopes of particular epitopes. For example, Amon et al.. Immunology J0J:555-562 (2000), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe mimotope peptide-based vaccines against Schistosoma mansoni. The mimotopes uses in these vaccines were obtained by screening a solid-phase 8mer random peptide library to identify mimotopes of an epitope recognized by a protective monoclonal antibody against Schistosoma mansoni. Similarly, Olszewska et al.. Virology 272:98-105 (2000), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated hain by refCTence, describe the<br><br>
identification of synthetic peptides which mimic an epitope of the measles virus fusion protein and the use of these peptides for the immunization of mice. In addition, Zuercherera/., £ur. /. Immunol. 50:128-135 (2000), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe compositions and methods for oral anti-IgE immunization using epitope-displaying phage. In particular, epitope-displaying M13 bacteriophages are employed as carriers for an oral anti-IgE vaccine. The vaccine compositions tested contain mimotopes and epitopes of the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody BSW17.<br>
The invention thus includes vaccine compositions which contain mimotopes that elicit immunological responses against particular antigens, as well as individual mimotope/corc particle conjugates and individual niimotope/non-naturaUy occurring molecular scaffold conjugate which make up these vaccine coirositions, and the use of these vaccine compositions to elicit immunological responses against specific antigens or antigenic determinants. Mimotopes may also be polypeptides, such as anti-idiotypic antibodies. Therefore, in a further prefened embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is an anti-idiotypic antibody or anti-idiotypic antibody firagment.<br>
The invention further includes compositions which contain mimotopes of the antigens or antigenic determinants described herein.<br>
Mimotopes of particular antigens may be generated and identified by any number of means including the screening of random peptide phage display libraries (see, e.g., PCX Publication No. WO 97/31948, the entire disclosure of which is incorpOTated herein by reference). Screening of such libraries will often be perfomied to identify peptides which bind to one or more antibodies having specificity for a particular antigen.<br>
Mimotopes suitable for use in vaccine compositions of the invention may be linear or circular peptides. Mimotopes which are linear or circular peptides may be linked to non-natural molecular scaffolds or core particles by a bond which is not a peptide bond.<br>
As suggested above, a number of human IgE mimotopes and epitopes have been identified which elicit immunological responses against human IgE molecules. (See. eg., per Publication No. WO 97/31948.) Thus, in certain embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which elicit an immunological response against immunoglobin molecules (e.g., IgE molecules).<br>
Peptides which can be used to elicit such immunological responses include proteins, protein subunits, domains of IgE molecules, and mimotopes which are capable of eliciting production of antibodies having specificity for IgE molecules.<br><br>
Generally, portions of IgE molecules used to prepare vaccine compositions will be derived from IgE molecules of the species from which the composition is to be administered. For example, a vaccine composition intended for administration to humans will often contain one or more portions of the human IgE molecule, and/or one or more mimotopes which are capable of eliciting immunological responses against human IgE molecules.<br>
In specific embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention intended for administration to humans wiU contain at least one portion of the constant reon of the IgE heavy chain set out in SEQ ID NO; 176; Accession No. AAB59424 (SEQ ID NO: 176). In more specific embodiments, IgE peptides used to prepare vaccine compositions of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, peptides having the foUowing amino acid sequences: CGGVNLTWSRASG (SEQ ID NO:178).<br>
In additional specific embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention will contain at least one mimotope which is capable of eliciting an immune rwponse that results in the production of antibodies having specificity for a particular antigen.<br>
Examples of mimotopes of IgE suitable for use in the preparation of vaccine<br>
compositions of the invention include peptides having the following amino<br>
acid sequences:<br><br><br><br>
The invention provides novel compositions and methods for the construction of ordered and repetitive antigen arrays. As one of skill in the art would know, the conditions foi the assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array depend to a large extent on the specific choice of the first attachment site of the non-natural fflolecuiar scaffold and the specific choice of the second attachment site of the antigen or antigmic detenninant. Thus, practitioner choice in the design of the composition (i.e., selection of the first and second attachment sites, antigen and non-natural molecular scaffolcD will determine the specific conditions for the assembly of the AlphaVaccine particle (the ordered and repetitive antigen array and non-natural molecular scaffold combined). Information relating to assembly of the AlphaVaccine particle is well within the working knowledge of the practitioner, and numerous references exist to aid the practitioner (e.g., Sambrook, J. et al., eds.. MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd- edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989); Ausubel, R et al., eds.. CURRENT PRCfTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John H. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1997); Celis, J., ed., CELL BIOLGY, Academic Press, 2" edition, (1998); Harlow, E. and Lane, D., "Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual," Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the /tW and FOS leucine zipper protein domains are utilized for the first and second attachment sites of the invention, respectively. In the preparation of AlphaVaccine particles, antigen must be produced and purified under conditions to promote assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array onto the non-natural molecular scaffold. In the particular JUN/FOS leucine zipper protein domain embodiment, the FOS-antigsn or F05-antigemc determinant should be treated with a reducing agent (e.g., Dithiothreitol (DTT)) to reduce or eliminate the incidence of disulfide bond formation (Example 15).<br>
For the preparation of the non-natural molecular scaffold {Le., recombinant Sinbis virus) of the JUNIFOS leucine zipper protein domain embodiment, recombinant E2-JUN viral particles should be concentrated, neutralized and treated with reducing agent (see Exanle 16).<br>
Assembly of the ordered and repetitive antigen array in the JUN/FOS embodiment is done in the presence of a redox shuffle. "E2-JUN viral particles are combined with a 240 fold molar excess of FOS-antigen or FOLS-antigenic determinant for 10 hours at 4"*C. Subsequently, the AlphaVaccine particle is concentrated and purified by chromatography (Example 16).<br>
1	In another embodiment of the invention, the coupling of the non-<br>
natural molecular scaffold to the antigen or antigenic determinant may be accomplished by chemical cross-linking. In a specific embodiment, the chemical agent is a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent such as e-maleimidocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Tanhnori et al~, J. Pharm. Dyn. 4".812 (1981); Fujiwara zt ai, J. Immunol. Meth. 45:195 (1981)), which contains (1) a succinimide group reactive with amino groups and (2) a maleimide group reactive with SH groups. A heterologous protein or polypeptide of the first attachment site may be engineered to contain one or more lysine residues that will serve as a reactive moiety for the succinimide portion of the heterobifunctional cross-linking agent. Once chMcdcaHy coupled to the lysine residues of the heterologous protein, the maleimide group of the heterobifunctional cross-linldng agent will be available to react with the SH group of a cysteine residue on the antigen or antigenic determinant Antigen or antigenic determinant preparation in this instance may require the engineering of a cysteine residue into the protein or polypeptide chosen as the second attachment site so that it may be reacted to the free maleimide function on the cross-linking agent bound to the non-natural molecular scaffold first attachment sites. Tlius, in such an instance, the heterobifunctional cross-linking agent binds to a first attachment site of the non-natural molecular scaffold and connects the scaffold to a second binding site of the antigen or antigenic determinant<br><br>
3.        Compositions, Vaccines, and the Administration Thereof, and Methods of Treatment<br>
The invention provides vaccine compositions which may be used for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions. The invention further provides vaccination methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions in individuals.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases in a wide range of species, particularly mammalian species such as human, monkey, cow, dog, cat, horse, pig, etc. Vaccines may be designed to treat inf«:tions of viral etiology such as HIV, influenza. Herpes, viral hepatitis, Epstein Bar, polio, viral encephalitis, measles, chicken pox, etc.; or infections of bacterial etiology such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, syphilis, etc.; or infections of parasitic etiology such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, etc.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides vaccines for the pmvKition of cancer in a wide range of species, particularly mammalian species such as human, monkey, cow, dog, cat, horse, pig, etc. Vaccines may be designed to treat all types of cancer: lymphomas, carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, etc.<br>
IJa another embodiment of the invention, compositions of the invention may be used in the designof vaccines for the treatment of allK"gies. Antibodies of the IgE isotype are important conqwnents in allergic reactions. Mast cells bind IgE antibodies on their surface and release histamines and other mediators of allergic response upon bintUng of specific antigen to the IgE molecules bound on the mast cell surface. Inhibiting production of IgE antibodies, therefore, is a promising target to protect against allergies, lliis should be possible by attaining a desired T helper cell response. T helper cell responses can be divided into type 1 (THI) and type 2 CTH2) T helper cell responses (Romagnani, Immunol Today iS:263-266 (1997)). THI cells secrete interferon-gamma and other cytokines which trigger B cells to produce IgGl-3 antibodies. In contrast, a critical cytokine produced by TH2 cells is TLA, which drived B cells to produce IgG4 and IgE. In many experimental systems, the development of THI and TH2 responses is mumally exclusive sinceTnl cells suppress the induction of TH2 cells and vice versa. Thus, antigens that trigger a strong TRI response simultaneously suppress the development of TH2 responses and hence fee production of IgE antibodies, interestingly, virtually all viruses induce a THI response in the host and fail to trigger the production of IgE antibodies (Coutelier et al, J. Exp. Med. 165:64-69 (1987)).   This isotype pattern is not restricted to live<br><br>
viruses but has also been observed for inactivated or recombinant viral particles (Lo-Man et al., Eur. J. Immunol 28:1401-1407 (1998)). TTius, by using the processes of the invention (e.g., AlphaVaccine Technology), viral particles can be decorated with various alleiens and used for immunization. Due to the resulting "viral structure" of the allergen, a THI response will be elicited, "protective" IgGl-3 antibodies will be produced, and the production of IgE antibodies which cause allergic reactions will be prevented. Since the allergen is presented by viral particles which are recognized by a different set of helper T cells than the allergen itself, it is likely that the allergen-specific IgGl-3 antibodies will be induced even in allergic individuals harboring pre¬existing TH2 cells specific for the allergen. The presence of hi concentrations of IgG antibodies may prevent binding of allergens to mast cell bound IgE, thereby inhibiting the release of histamine. Thus, presence of IgG antibodies may protect from IgE mediated allergic reactions. Typical substances causing allergies include: grass, ragweed, birch or mountain cedar pollens, house dust, mites, animal danders, mold, insect venom or drugs (e.g.., penicillin). Tlius, immunization of individuals with allCTgen-decorated viral particles should be beneficial not only before but also after the onset of allergies.<br>
hi specific embodiments, the invention provides methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions which are caused or exacerbated by "self" gene products (e.g., tumor necrosis factors), i.e. "self antigens" as used herein. In related embodiments, the invention provictes methods for inducing immunological responses in individuals which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate diseases or conditions are caused or exacerbated by "self gene products. Examples of such diseases or conditions include graft versus host disease, IgE-mediated allergic reactions, anhylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, Crohn"s disease, allergic asthma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin"s lymphoma (NHL), Graves" disease, inflammatory autoimmune diseases, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), immunoproliferative disease lymphadenopathy (IPL), angioimmunoproUferative lymphadenopathy (AIL), immunoblastive lymphadenopathy (IBL), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, when compositions of the invention are administered to an individual, they may be in a composition which contains salts, buffers, adjuvants, or other substances which are desirable for improving the. efficacy of the composition. Examples of materials suitable for use in preparing pharmaceutical compositions are provided in numerous sources including REMINGTON"S PHABMACEUTFCAL ScaENCES (Osol, A, ed. Mack PubhshingCo.,(1990)).<br><br>
Compositions of the invention are said to be "pharmacologically acceptable" if their administration can be tolerated by a recipient individual. Further, the compositions of the invention will be administered in a "thapeutically effective amount" {i.e., an amount that produces a desired physiological effect).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be adininistered by various methods known in the art, but will normally be administered by injection, infusion, inhalation, oral administration, or other suitable physical methods. The compositions may alternatively be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcataneously. Components of compositions for administration include staile aqueous (e.g., {diysiologicai saline) or non-aqueous solutions and suspensions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Carriers or occlusive dressings can be used to increase skin permeability and enhance antigen absorption.<br>
Prion-mediated diseases are an increasing threat for society. Specifically, prion-induced BSE in cattle represents a disease that has long been neglected and may affect a great number of animals throuout Europe. Moreover, a variant form of CJD is attributed to infection of humans after consumption of meat of prion-infected cattle. Althou the number of infected people has been relatively low so far, it seems possible that the disease may become epidemic. However, long-term prognosis for the development of vCJD may be particular difficult, since incubation times between infection and overt disease are very long (an estimated 10 years).<br>
Prions are cellular proteins existing in most mammahan species. Prion proteins exist in two forms, a normally folded form that is usxy present in healthy individuals (PrP" and a misfolded form that causes disease (Ptp). The current prion hypotheses postulates that the misfolded prion form Prp can catalyse the refolding of healthy prion PrP into disease causing Prp " (A. Aguzzi, Haematologica 85, 3-10 (2000)). \B. some rare instances, this transition inay also occur spontaneously, causing classical CJD in humans. Some mutations in PrP are associated with an increase in this spontaneous transition, causing the various forms of familial CJD. However, Pip* may also be infectious and may be transmitted by blood transfusion or via the food chain. The latter form of prion mediated disease is known as Kuru Kuru and used to occur in human cannibals. However, since species that are feeding on their own individuals are not abundant, this form of orally transmitted disease was too rare to be documented for other species.<br>
The massive feeding of cows with beef-products throughout Europe now<br><br>
changed the situation and numbers of cows infected with a transmissible form of BSE-causing Pip , dramatically increased in recent years, afflicting hundreds of thousands of cows. This sudden appearance of massive numbers of BSE-diseased cows caused great fear in the human population that a similar disease may be induced in humans. Indeed, in 1996, the first case of a variant form of CJD was reported that could be attributed to the consumption of Prp"" infected beef. Until now, this fear has further increased, since the number of infected humans has constantly increased during the following years and no cure is in sight. Moreover, since sheep succumb to a prion-mediated disease called scrie and ance other mammalian species can be infected with Pip<br>
Experimentally, it is possible that BSE-like diseases may occur also in other species. The mechanism of prion transmission has been studied in great detail. It is now clear that prions first replicate in the lymphoid organs of infected mice and are subsequently transported to the central nervous system. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), a rare cell population in lymphoid organs, seems to be essential for both replication of prion proteins in the lymphoid organs and transport into the central nervous system (S. Brandner, M. A. Klein, A. Aguzzi, Transfus Clin Biol 6, 17-23 (1999); F. Montrasio, et al.. Science 288, 1257-9 (2000)). FDCs are a poorly studied cell type but it is now clear that they depend upon the production of lymphotoxin and/or TNF by B cells for their development (F. Mackay, J. L, Browning, Nature 395, 26-27 (1998)). Indeed, mice deficient for lymphotoxin do not exhibit FDCs (M S. Matsumoto, et al.. Science 264. 703-707 (1996)). Moreover, they fail to be productively infected with prions and do not succumb to disease. Jn addition to FDCs, antibodies may also play a role in disease progression (S. Brandner, M. A. Klein, A. Aguzzi, Transfus Clin Biol 6, 17-23 (1999)).<br>
Recently, it was shown that blocking the LTb pathway using a Ltb receptor Fc fusion molecule not only eliminates FDCs in mice but also blocks infection witii PrP (F. Monttasio, et al., Science 288, 1257-9 (2000). Thus, a vaccine that induces antibodies specific for LTb or its receptor may be able to block transmission of PrP from one individual to another or fix&gt;m the periphery to the central nervous system.<br>
However, it is usually difficult if not impossible to induce antibody responses to self-molecules by conventional vaccination. One way to improve the efficiency of vaccination is to increase the degree of repetitiveness of the antigen applied: Unlike isolated proteins, viruses induce prompt and efficient immune responses in the absence of any adjuvants both with and without T -cell help (Bachmann  &amp; Zinkemagel,Ann. Rev.  Immunol:   15:235-270 (1991)).  Although<br><br>
viruses often consist of few proteins, they are able to trigger much stronger immune responses than their isolated components. For B-cell responses, it is known that one crucia] factor for ihe immunogenicity of viruses is the repetiliveness and order of surface epitopes. Many viruses exhibit a quasi- crystalline surface that displays a regular array of epitopes which efficiently crosslinks epitope-specific immunoglobulins on B cells (Bachmann &amp; Zinkemagel, Immunol. Today 17:553-558 (1996)). Tliis crosslinking of surface immunoglobulins on B cells is a strong activation signal that directly induces ceU- cycle progression and the production of IgM antibodies. Further, such triggered B cells are able to activate T helper cells, which in Uira induce a switch fcom IgM to IgG antibody productioa in B cells and the generation of long-lived B cell memory - the goal of any vaccination (Bachmann &amp; Zinkemagel, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 15:235-270 (1997)). Viral structure is even linked to the generation of anti-antibodies in autoimmune disease and as a part of the natural response to paUiogens (see Fehr, T., et al., J Exp. Med. 185:1785-1792 (1997)). TTius, antibodies presented b)" a highly organized viral surface are able to induce strong anti-antibody responses.<br>
ITie immune system usually fails to produce antibodies against self-derived stmctures. For soluble antigens present at low concentrations, this is due to tolerance at the Hi cell level. Under these conditions, coupling the self-antigen to a carrier that can deliver T help may break tolerance. For soluble proteins present at high concentrations or membrane proteins at low concentration, B and Th cells may be tolerant. However, B cell tolerance may be reversible (anergy) and can be broken by administration of the antigen in a hiy organized fashion coupled to a foreign carrier (Bachmann &amp; Zinkemagel, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 15:235-270 (1997). Thus, LTb, LTa or LTb receptor as highly organized as a virus, a virus like particle or a bacterial pilus may be able to break B cell tolerance and to induce antibodies specific for these molecules.<br>
The present invention is related to the fields of molecular biology, virology, immunology and medicine. The invention provides a method that facilitates induction of antibodies specific for endogenous lymphotoxin (LT)b, LTa or LTb receptor. The invention also provides a process for producing an antigen or antigenic determinant that is able to elicit antibodies specific for LTb, LTa or LTb receptor which is useful for the prevention and therapy of prion-mediated diseases such as variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (vCJD) or bovine spongioform encephalopalliy (BSE) and elimination of lymphoid organ like strucmres in autoimmune diseased tissues.<br>
TTie object of the invention is to provide a vaccine that is able to induce antibodies specific for LTb, LTa or LTb receptor thereby eliminating FDCs<br><br>
from lymphoid organs. This treatment may allow preventing infection with PrP" or spread of PrP" from the periphery to the central nervous system. In addition, this treatment blocks generation of lymphoid organ like structures in organs targeted by autoimmune disease and may even (Ussolve such existing structures, ameliorating disease symptoms.<br>
LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof are coupled to a protein carrier that is foreign to the host In a preferred embodiment of the invention, LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof will be coupled to a highly organized structure in order to render these molecules highly repetitive and organized The hiy organized structure may be a bacterial pilus, a virus like particle (VLP) generated by recombinant proteins of the bacteriophage QP, recombinant proteins of Rotavirus, recombinant proteins of Norwalkvirus, recombinant proteins of Alphavirus, recombinant proteins of Foot and Mouth Disease virus, recombinant proteins of Retrovirus, recombinant proteins of Hepatitis B virus, recombinant proteins of Tobacco mosaic virus, recombinant proteins of Flock House Virus, and recombinant proteins of human Papillomavirus. In order to optimize the three-dimensional arrangement of LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof on the highly organized structure, an attachment site, such as a chemically reactive amino-acid, is introduced into the highly organized structure (unless it is naturally there) and a binding site, such as a chemically reactive amino acid, will be introduced on the LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments (unless it is naturally there). The presence of an attachment site on the highly organized structure and a binding site on the LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof will allow to couple these molecules to the repetitive structure in an oriented and ordered fashion which is essential for the induction of efficient B cell responses.<br>
In an equally preferred embodiment, the attachment site introduced in the repetitive structure is biotin that specifically binds sfreptavidin. Biotin may be introduced by chemical modification. LTb, LTa or LTb receptor or fragments thereof may be fiised or linked to streptavidin and bound to the biotinylated repetitive structure.<br>

A modular system containing a free cysteine flanked by several glycines, a protease cleavage site and the constant regjon of the human IgGl was generated as follows. pSec2/Hygro B (Invitrogen Cat. No. V910-20) was digested with Bspl20I and Hind HI and ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides SU7 (SEQ ID NO:278) and SU8 (SBQ ID NO:279) leading to construct pSec-B-MCS. pSec-B-MCS was then digested with Nhe I and Hind HI and ligated with the annealed oligonucleolides PH29 (SEQ ID NO:264) and PH30 (SEQ ID NO:265) leading to constmct pSec 29/30. The construct pSec-FL-EK-Fc* was generated by" a three fragment ligation of the following fragments; first pSec 29/30 digested with Eco RI and Hind HI, the annealed oligonucleotides PH31 (SEQ ID NO:266) and PH32 (SEQ ID NO. 267) and the Bgi I/EcoRI fragment of a plasraid (pSP-Fc*-Cl) containing a modified vMion of the human IgGl constant region (for details of the hu IgGl sequence see the sequence of the final construct pCep-Xa-Fc* see HG. lA-lC). The complete sequence of pCep-Xa-Fc* is given in SEQ ID NO:283. Tlie resulting construct was named pSec-FL-EK-Fc*. From this plasmid the linker region and the human IgGl Fc part was excised by Nhe I, Pme I digestion and cloned into pCep-MCS digested with Nhe I and Pme I leading to construct pCep-FL-EK-Fc*. Thus a modular vector, was created where the hnker sequence and the protease cleavage site, which are located between the Nhe I and Hind III sites, can easily be exchanged with annealed oligonucleotides, For the generation of cleavable fusion protein vectors pCep-FL-EK-Fc* was digested with<br><br>

The resistant cells were then expanded in selective medium. For the harvesting of the fusion proteins the resistant cell population were passed onto poly-L-lysine coated dishes. Once the cells had reached confluence, they were washed 2 times with PBS and serum free medium (DMEM) was added to the plates. The tissue culture supernatant were harvested every 2 to 4 days and replaced with fresh DMEM medium during a period of up to one month. "Die harvested supematants were kept at 4 °C.<br>

Example 9 Cloning, expression and purification of IL-13 to VLPs and Pili<br>
A.       Cloning and expression of InterleuKn 13 (IL-13) with an N-terminal amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue for coupling to VLPs and Pili a) Cloning of mouse IL-13 (HEK.-293T) for expression in mammalian cells as Fc fusion protein The DNA for the cloning of IL-13 was isolated by RT-PCR from in vitro activated splenocytes, wich were obtained as following: CD4+ T cells were isolated from mouse spleen cells and incubated 3 days in EMDM (+5% PCS + 10 ng/ml IL4) in 6 well plates which have been previously coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The RNA from these cells was used to amplify IL13 by one-step RT-PCR (Qiagen one-step PCR Idt). Primer XhoIL13-R was used for the reverse transccription of the RNA and the primers NheIL13-F (SEQ ID NO:338) and XhoIL13-R (SEQ ID NO:339) were used for the PCR amplification of the IL13 cDNA. Amplified IL13 cDNA was ligated in a pMOD vector using the Nhel/Xhol restriction sites (giving the vector pMODB 1-IL13). pMODB 1-113 was digested BamHI/XhoI and the fragment containing IL13 was ligated in the pCEP-SP-XA-Fc*(Axho) vector, an analogue of pCEP-SP-XA-Fc* where a Xhol site at the end of the Fc sequence has been removed, which had been previously digested with BamHI/XhoL Tlie plasmid resulting from this ligation (pCEP-SP-IL13-Fc) was sequenced and used to transfect HEK-293T cells. The resulting IL13 construct enaided by this plasroid had the aroino acid sequence ADPGCGGGGGLA fused at the N-terminus of the IL-13 mature sequence. This sequence comprises the amino acid linker sequence GCGGGOG flanked by additional amino acids introduced during the cloning procedure. IL13-Fc could be purified with Protein-A resin from the supernatant of the ceUs transfected with pCEP-SP-IL13-Fc. The result of the expression is shown on HG. 17 B (see EXAMPLE 10 for description of the samples). Mature IL-13 fused at its N-terminus with the aforementioned anuno acid sequence is released upon cleavage of the fusion protein with Factor-Xa, leading to a protein called hereinafter "mouse C-IL-13-F" and having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:328. The result of FIG. 17 B clearly demonstrates expression of the IL-13 construct.<br><br>
b) Cloning of mouse IL-13 (HEK-293T)forexpressioninmaminahan cells with GST (Glutathion-S-transferase) fused at its N-terminus The cDNA used for cloning lL-13 with an N-tenninal GST originated from the cDNA of TH2 actiated T-cells as described above (a.). IL-13 was amplified ftom this cDNA using the primers NheIinklIL13-F and IL13StopXhoNot-R. The PCR product was digested with Nhel and Xhol and ligated in the pCEP-SP-GST-EK vector previously digested with Nhel/Xhol. The plasmid which could be isolated from the ligation (pCEP-SP-GST-IL13) was used to transfecl HEK-293T cells. The resulting IL 13 construct encoded by this plasmid had the amino acid sequence LACGGGGG fused at the N-tMminus of the IL-13 mature sequence. This sequence comprises the ansino acid linker sequence ACGGGGG flanked by an additional amino acid introduced during the cloning procedure. The culture supernatant of the cells transfected with pCEP-SP-GST-IL13 contained the fusion protein GST-IL13 which could be purified by Glutathione affinity chromatography according to standard protocols. Mature IL-13 fused at its N-terminus with aforementioned amino acid sequence is released upon cleavage of the fusion protein with enterokinase, leading to a protein called hereinafter "mouse C-IL-13-S" and having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:329.<br>

This insert was ligated into a pET vector derivative (pMODEC3-8 vector), previously digested with Nhel and Notl (not dephosphorylated), and transformed into E.coli TGI cells. The IL5 construct generated by cloning into pMODBC3-8 vector contains at its N-teiminus a hexa-hiatidine tag, followed by an enteroldnase site, an N-tecffiinal gamma 3 amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue, flanked C-terminaUy by the sequence AS and N-terminally by the sequence ALV, and the mature fonn of the IL 5 gene. The protein released by cleavage with enteroldnase is called "mouse C-IL-5-E" (SEQ ID NO:332). Plasmid DNA of resulting clone pMODC6-IL5.2 (also caUed pMODC6-IL5), whose sequence had been confinned by DNA sequencing, was transformed into Kco/i strain BL21.<br>
Clone pMODC6-IL5/BL21 WM grown over night in 5 ml UB containing 1 mg/L AmpiciUin. 2 ml of this culture were diluted in 100 nil terrific broth (TB) containing Img/L AmpiciUin. The culture was induced by adding 0.1 ml of a IM solution of Ispropyl P-D-Thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture reached an optical density OD600=0.7. 10 ml samples were taken every 2h. The samples were centrifugated 10 min at 4000 x g. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml Lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% triton X-100 (pH8). After having added 20 pi of Lysozyme (40n:ml) and having incubated the tube 30 min at 4°C, the cells were sonicated for 2 min. 100 1 of a 50 mM MgCl2 solution and 1 ml of benzonase were added.

The template described under (A) (ATCC clone 37562) was used for the cloning of the following construct. The plasmid pM0DBl-IL5 (a pET derivative) was digested with BamHI/XhoI to yield a small fragement encoding IL5 fused to an N terminal amino acid linker containing a cysteine. Tiiis fragment was ligated in the vector pCBP-SP-XA--Fc*(AXho) wliich had previously been digested with BamHI and Xhol. The ligation was electroporated into E.coli strain TGI and plasmid DNA of resulting clone pCEP-SP-IL5-Fc.2, whose sequence had been confirmed by DNA sequencing, was used to transfect HEK-293T cells. The resulting 115 construct encoded by this plasmid had the amino acid sequence ADPGCGGGGGLA fused at the N-tenninus of the TLr5 mature sequence. This sequence comprises ttie amino acid linker sequence GCGGGGG containing a cysteine and flanked by additional amino acids introduced during the cloning procedure. The IL-5 protein released by cleavage of the fusion protein with Factor-Xa is named hereinafter "mouse C-IL-5-F" (SEQ ID NO:333).<br>
After transfection and selection on Puromycin the culture supernatant was analyzed by Western-Blot (FIG. 17 B) using an anti-Ks (mouse) and an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated tb Horse raddish peroxidase. The anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Horse raddish peroxidase also detects Fc-fosion proteins. Purification of the protein was performed by affinity chromatography on Protein-A resin.

After digestion with Nhel and Xhol the insert was ligated into pCEP-SP-GST-EK which had been previously digested with Nhel and Xhol. The resulting plasmid pCEP-SP-GST-IL5 was sequenced and used for transfection of HEK-293T cells. The resulting lL-5 construct encoded by this plasmid had the amino acid sequence LACGC3GGG fused at the N-terminus of the IL-5 mature sequence. This sequence comprises the amino acid linter sequence ACGGGGG containing a cysteine residue and flanked by additional amino acids introduced during the cloning procedure. The protein released by cleavage with enterokinase was named hereinafter "mouse C-IL-5-S" (SEQ ID NO:334).

Coupling of AP 1-15, AP 1-27 and AP 33-42 peptides to Pili using the cross-linker SMPH.<br>
The following Ap peptides were chemically synthesized: DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQGGC ("Ap 1-15"), a peptide which comprises the amino acid sequence from residue 1-15 of human Ap, fused at its C-terminus to the sequence GGC for coupling to Pili and VXPs,<br>
DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNGGC ("Ap 1-27") a peptide which comprises the amino acid sequence from residue 1-27 of human Ap, fused at its C-terminus to the sequence GGC for coupling to Pili and VIPs, and CGHGNKSGLMVGGWIA ("AP 33-42") a peptide which comprises the amino acid sequence from residue 33-42 of AP, fused at its N-terminus to the sequence CGHGNKS for coupling to Pili and VLPs. All three peptides were used for chemical coupling to Pili as described in the following.<br>
Asolution of 2ml of 2mg/ml Pili in 20 mM Hepes 150mM NaCl pH 7.4 was reacted for 45 minutes with 468 1 of a solution of 33.3 mM SMPH (Pierce) in H2O, at 25 *C on a rocking shaker. The reaction solution was loaded on a PD10 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with 6 X 500 pu of 20 mM Hepes 150mM NaCl pH 7.4. Fractions were analyzed by dotting on a Nitrocellulose (Schleicher &amp; Schuell) and stained with Amddoblack. Fractions 3-6 were pooled. The samples were then frozen in aliquots in liquid Nitrogen and stored at -80°C until coupling.<br>
200 u1 of the thawed desalted reaction mixture was then mixed with 200 fil DMSO and 2.5 \il of each of the corresponding 50 mM peptide stock solutions in DMSO, for 3.5 hours at RT on a rocking shaker. 400 JJJ of the reaction mixture was subsequently dialyzed three times for one hour against 1 liter of 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 at 4 "C in a dialysis tubing with Molecular Weight cutoff 10000 Da. The samples were then frozen in aliquots in liquid Nitrogen and stored at -80°C<br>
Sample preparation for SDS-Page was performed as follows: 100 )il of<br><br>
the dialyzed coupling reaction was incubated for 10 minutes in 10 % TCA on ice and subsequently centrifiiged. The pellet was resuspended in 50 fl 8.5 M Guanidine-HCl solution and incubated for 15 minutes at 70°C. The samples were then precipitated with ethanol, and after a second centrifugation step, the pellet was resuspended in sample buffer.<br>
The results of the coupling experiments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Clear coupling bands were visible for all three peptides, demonstrating coupling of AP peptides to Pili.<br>

A.	Immunization of APP23 nuce<br>
Three different AS peptides (AB l-27-Gly-Gly-Cys-NH2; H-Cys-Gly-His-Gly-Asn-Lys-Ser-A6 33-42; A6 1-15-Gly-Gly-Cys-NH2) were coupled to Qp capsid protein. The resulting vaccines were termed "Qb-Ab 1-15", "Qb-Ab 1-27" and "Qb~ Ab 33-42". 8 months old female APP23 mice which carry a human APP transgene (Sturchler-Pierrat er a/.. Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA94: 13287-13292(1997)) were used for vaccination. The mice were injected subcutaneously with 25 fig vaccine diluted in sterile PBS and 14 days later boosted with the same amount of vaccine. Mice were bled from the tail vein before the start of immunization and 7 days after the booster injection. The sera were analyzed by ELIS A.<br>
B.	EUSA<br>
AP 1-40 and AP 1-42 peptide stocks were made in DMSO and diluted in coating buffer before use. ELJSA plates were coated with 0.1 fig /well Ap 1-40 or Ap 1-42 peptide. The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted mouse serum. Bound antibodies were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. As a control, sera obtained before vaccination were also included. The<br><br>
serum dilution showing a mean three standard deviations above baseline was calculated and defined as "ELISA titer". All three vaccines tested were immunogenic in APP23 mice and induced high antibody titers against the A6 peptides 1-40 and/or AB 1-42. TTie results are shown in FIG. 20. No specific antibodies were detected in preimmune sera of the same mice (not shown).<br>
Shown on FIG. 20 are the EUSA signals obtained on day 22 with the sera of the mice immunized with vaccines Pr-AB 1-15, and HBc-Apl-15 respectively. A control serum from a nai"ve mouse (preimmune serum) was also included. Results fit&gt;m different serum dilutions are shown as optical density at 450 nm. Average results from three vaccinated mice each are shown.<br>
Mice A21-A30 received the vaccine Qb-Ab 1-15, mice A31-A40 received Qb-Ab 1-27 and mice A41-49 received Qb-Ab 332. For each mouse, Ap 1*0 and Ap 1-42 peptide-specific serum antibody titers were determined on day 21 by ELISA. The ELSIA titers defined as the serum dilution showing a mean three standard deviations above baseline are shown for individual mice. Mice vaccinated with Qb-Ab 1-15 or Qb-Ab 1-27 made high antibody titers against botii Ap 1-40 and Ap 1-42 whereas mice vaccinated with Qb-Ab 33-42 had only high antibody titers against the AP 1-42 peptide.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
Coupling of Fab antibody fragmraits to QP capsid proton<br>
A solution of 4.0 mg/ml QP capsid protein in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2 was reacted fCM- 30 minutes with a 2.8 mM SMPH (Pierce) (firom a stock solution dissolved in DMSO) at 25°C on a rocldng shaker. The reaction solution was sutsequentiy dialyzed twice for 2 hours against 21 of 20 mM Ifepes, 150 mM NaQ, pH7.2at4°C.<br>
The Fab fragment of human IgG, produced by papain digestion of human IgG, waspurchasedfrom Jackson Immunolab. This solution (11. Img/ml) was diluted to a concentration of 2.5mg/ml in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2 and allowed to react with different concentrations (0-1000 \JM) of either dithiothreitol (DTT) or tricarboxyethylphosphine (TCEP) for 30 minutes at 25°C.<br><br>
Coupling was induced by mixing the derivatized and dialysed QP capsid protein solution with non-reduced or reduced Fab solution (final concentrations: 1.14 mg/ml Q3 and 1.78 mg/ml Fab) and proceeded ovemit at 25 °C on a rocking shaker.<br>
The reaction products were analysed on 16% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The results are shown in, FIG. 21.<br>
A coupling product of about 40 kDa could be detected in samples in which the Fab had been reduced before coupling by 25-1000 \JM TCEP and 25 - 100 pM DTT (FIG. 21, arrow), but not at 10 fiM TCEP, 10 pM DTT or 1000 \iM DTT. The coupled band also reacted with an anti-QP antiserum (data not shown) clearly demonstrating the covalent coupling of the Fab fragment to Qp capsid protein.<br>

EXAMPLE 17 Vaccination of APP23 mice wiUi A peptides coupled to Qp capsid protein<br>
A.	Immunization of APP23 mice<br>
Three different A6 peptides (A6 l-27-GIy-Gly-Cys-NH2; H-Cys-GIy-His-Gly-Asn-Lys-Ser-AS 33-42; A6 1-15-Gly-Gly-Cys-NH2) were coupled to Qp capsid protein. The resulting vaccines were teimed "Qb-Ab 1-15", "Qb-Ab 1-27" and "Qb-Ab 33-42". 8 months old female APP23 mice which carry a human APP transgene (Sturchler-Pierrat et al, ProcNatl Acad.ScL USA 94:13287-13292 (1997)) were used for vaccination. The mice were injected subcutaneously with 25 ig vaccine diluted in sterile PBS and 14 days later boosted with the same amount of vaccine. Mice were bled from the tail vein before the start of immunization and 7 days after the booster injection. The sera were analyzed by ELISA.<br>
B.	EUSA<br>
AP 1-40 and AP 1-42 peptide stocks were made in DMSO and diluted in coating buffer before use. EUSA plates were coated with 0.1 p.g /well Ap 1-40 or AP 1-42 peptide. The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted mouse serum. Bound antibodies were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. As a control, sera obtained before vaccination were also included. The serum dilution showing a mean three standard deviations above baseline was calculated and defined as "EUSA titer". All three vaccines tested were immunogenic in APP23 mice and induced high antibody titers against the A6 peptides 1-40 and/or AB 1-42. The results are shown in HG. 20. No specific antibodies were detected in preimmune sera of the same mice (not shown).<br>
Shown on FIG. 20 are the ELISA signals obtained on day 22 with the sera of the mice immunized with vaccines Qb-Ab 1-15, Qb-Ab 1-27 and Qb-Ab 33-42, respectively. Mice A21-A30 received Ihe vaccine Qb-Ab 1-15, mice A31-A40 received Qb-Ab 1-27 and mice A41-49 received Qb-Ab 33-42. For each mouse, AP 1-40 and AP 1-42 peptide-specific serum antibody titers were determined on day 21 by EUSA. TTie ELSIA titers defined as the serum dilution showing a mean three standard deviations above baseline are shown for individual mice. Mice vaccinated<br><br>
	-1<br>
with Qb-Ab 1-15 or Qb-Ab 1-27 made high antibody titers against both Ap 1-40 and AP 1-42 whereas mice vaccinated with Qb-Ab 33-42 had only high antibody titers against the AP 1-42 peptide. The very strong immune responses obtained with the human A6 peptides in the transgenic mice expressing human A6 transgene, demonstrate that by coupling AP peptides to QP capsid protein, tolerance towards the self-antigen can be overcome.<br>

EXAMPLE 19 Desensitizatioii of allergic mice with PLA2 coupled to Qp csid protein<br>
C.      Desensitization of allM"gic mice by vaccination<br>
Female CBA/J mice (8 weeks old) were sensitized with PLA2: Per mouse, 0.1 ug PLA2 from Latoxan (France) was adsoibed to 1 mg Alum (Imject, Pierce) in a total volume of 66 ul by vortexing for 30 min and then injected subcutaneously. This procedure was repeated every 14 days for a total of four times. This treatment led to the development of PLA2-specific serum IgE but no IgG2a antibodies. 1 month after the last sensitization, mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 \i% vaccine consisting of recombinant PLA2 coupled to Qp capsid protein. One and 2 weeks later they were again treated with the same amount of vaccine. One week after the last<br><br>
treatment, mice were bled and then challenged intraperitoneally with 25 |xg PLA2 (Latoxan) and rectal temperature was measured for 60 min using a calibrated digital thermometer. As a control sensitized mice which had not been treated with QP capsid protein-PLA2 were used. Whereas all control mice experienced an anaphylactic response reflected in a dramatic drop in rectal temperature after PLA2 challenge, vaccinated mice were fully or at least partially protected. Results are shown in FIG 25 A.<br>
B.      ELISA<br>
ELISA plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated with PLA2 (Latoxan) at 5 Hg/ml. The plates were blocked and then incubated witti serially diluted serum. For the detection of IgE antibodies, serum was pretreated with protein G beads (Pharmacia) for 60 min on a shaker at room temperature. The beads were removed by centrifiigation and the supernatant was used for EUSA. Antibodies bound to P1A2 were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG2a or IgE antibodies. ELISA titers were determined at half maximal optical density (OD50%) and expressed as -logS of 100-fold prediltued sera for IgG2a and as -log5 of 10-fold prediluted sera for IgE. For all mice, PLA2-specific IgG2a and IgE in serum were deteamined before and at the end of Ae vaccine treatment Vaccination led to a dramatic increase of PLA2-specific IgG2a whereas no consistent changes in IgE titers were noted. These results indicate that the vaccination led to an induction of a Thl-Uke immune response (reflectedby the production of IgG2a). Results are shown in FIG. 25 B.<br>
The Anaphylactic response in vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice is shown in FIG. 25A.<br>
Mice were sensitized to PLA2 and then treated 3x subcutaneously with 10 \ig vaccine consisting of PLA2 coupled to QP capsid protein. Control mice were sensitized but not vaccinated. One week after the last vaccination all mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 25 ng PLA2 and the anaphylactic response was monitored by measuring the rectal temperature for 60 min. Whereas all control mice showed a dramatic drop in body temperature, vaccinated mice were fiilly or at least<br><br>
partially protected from an anaphylactic reaction.<br>
The induction of PLA2-Specific IgGla by vaccination is shown in FIG. 25 B.<br>
Mice were sensitized to PLA2 and then treated 3x with 10 ug vaccine consisting of PLA2 coupled to Qp capsid protein. Control mice were sensitized but not vaccinated. Serum was taken from sensitized mice before the start of the treatment and after completion of treatment, before challenge. In vaccinated mice 0eft hand of panel) a dramatic increase of PLA2-specific IgG2a was observed.<br>

An overnight culture was grown in dYT medium containing 100 |i,g/ml Ampicillin and 15 g/ml Chloramphenicol. The culture was diluted in fresh dYT medium containing Ampicillin and Chloranhenicol, and grown at 3TC until OD ajo iun= 1 was reached, ITie culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and grown for another 4 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml Lysozyme. After incubation on ice, cells were sonicated on ice, and MgCl2 added to a concentration of 10 mM. 6 jiJ of Benzonase (Merck) were added to the cell lysate, and the lysate was incubated 30 minutes at RT. Triton was added to a final concentration of 1 %, and the lysate was further incubated for 30 minutes on ice. The inclusion body (IB) pellet was collected by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13000 g. The inclusion body pellet was washed in wash buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 23% sucrose, I mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The IBs were solubilized in 6 M Guanidinium-HCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 200 mM DTT. Hie solubilized IBs were centrifuged at 50000 g and the supernatant dialyzed against 6 M Guanidinium-HCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and subsequently against fee same buffer containing 0.1 mM DTT. Oxidized glutathion<br><br>
was added to a final concentration of 50 mM, andihe solubilized .IBs were incubated for 1 h. at RT. The solubilized IBs were dialyzed against 6 M Guanidinium-HCL, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The concentration of the EB solution was estimated by Bradford analysis and SDS-PAGE.<br>
B.	Refolding and purification<br>
The IB solution was added slowly in three portions, every 24 h., to a final concentration of 3 jiM, to the refolding buifer containing 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM Benzamidin, 0.2 mM 6 aminocapronic acid, 0.2 mM Guanidinium-HCl, 0.4 M L-Arginin, pH 6.8, to which 5 mM reduced Glutathion and 0.5 mM oxidized Glutathion were added prior to initiation of refolding at 4°C. The refolding solution was concentrated to one half of its volume by Ultrafiltration using a YMIO membrane (Millipore) and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mM DTP. The protein was further concentrated by ultraiiltration and loaded onto a Superdex G-75 column (Phaimacia) equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaQ, 0.1 mM DTT, 4 °C for purification. The pH of the equilibration buffer was adjusted to 7.2 at RT. The monomeric firactions were pooled.<br>

EXAMPLE 21 Coupling of anti-idiotypic IgE mimobody VAE051 to Qp, immunization of mice and testing of antisera<br>
A solution of 4.0 mg/ml QP capsid protein in 20 mM Hes, 150 inM NaCl pH 7.2 was reacted for 30 minutes with 10 fold molar excess SMPH (Pierce) (from a 100 raM stock solution dissolved in DMSO) at 25 *C on a rocking shaker. The reaction solution w subsequently dialyzed twice for 2 hours against 2 1 of 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCi, pH 7.2 at 4 "C. The VAE051 solution (2.4 mg/ml) was reducted with an equimolar concentration ofTCEP for 60 min at 25 "C.<br>
46 (il of the dialyzed Qp reaction mixture was then reacted with 340 \)1 of the TCH*-tieated VAE051 solution (2.4 mg/ml) in a total volume of 680 jil of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at<br>
16 "C for 2 h on a rocking shaker.<br><br>
The reaction products were analysed on 16% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The two additional band in the coupling reactions (which are absent in VAE or Qp solutions) represent the heavy chain and the light chain of the VAE05I coupled to QP (FIG. 28 A). Identity of the bands were confinned by Western blotting with antibodies specific for heavy and light chains, respectively.<br>
Immunization of mice<br>
The QP-VAE051 coupling solution was dialysed ainst 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 using a membrane with a cut-off of 300000 Da. 50 \ig of die Q-VAE051 were injected intreritoneal in two female Balb/c mice at day 0 and day 14. Mice were bled rctroorbitally on day 28 and their serum was analyzed using IgE- and VAE051-specific BUS As.<br>
EUSA<br>
ELISA plates were coated with human IgE at a concentration of 0.8 p.g/ml or with 10 p.g/ml VAE051. The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted mouse sera. Bound antibodies were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (FIG. 28 B).<br>
Both mice showed high reactivity to VAFX)51 as well as the human IgE. Preimmune sera of the same mice did not show any reactivity against VAE051 and IgE (FIG. 28 B). TTiis demonstrates that antibodies against the anti-idiotypic IgE mimobody VAE051 have been produced which also recognize the "parent" molecule IgE.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 23 Insertion of a peptide containing a Lysine residue into the c/el epitope of<br>
HBcAg(I-149)<br><br>
The c/el epitope (residues 72 to 88) of HBcAg is located in the tip region on the surface of the Hepatitis B virus csid (HBcAg). A part of this region (Proline 79 and Alanine 80) was genetically replaced by die peptide Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (HBcAg-Lys construct). The introduced Lysine residue contains a reactive amino group in its side chain that can be used for intermolecular chemical crosslinking of HBcAg particles with any antigen containing a free cysteine group.<br>
HBcAg-Lys DNA, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO:158, was generated by PCRs: The two fragments encoding HBcAg fragments<br>
(amino acid residues 1 to 78 and 81 to 149) were amplified separately by PCR. Tlie<br>
primers used for these PCRs also introduced a DNA sequence encoding the Gly-GIy-<br>
Lys-GIy-Gly peptide. The HBcAg (I to 78) fragment was amplified from pEco63<br>
using primers EcoR]HBcAg(s) and Lys-HBcAg(as). The HBcAg (81 to 149)<br>
fragment was amplified from pBco63 using primers Lys-HBcAg(s) and HBcAg(l-<br>
149)Hind(as).	Primers     Lys-HBcAg(as)    and    Lys-HBcAg(s)    introduced<br>
complementary DNA sequences at the ends of the two PCR products allowing fusion of the two PCR products in a subsequent assembly PCR. The assembled frijnents were amplified by PCR using primers EcoRiHBcAg(s) and HbcAg(l-149)Hind(as).<br>
For the PCRs, 100 pmol of each oligo and 50 ng of the template DNAs were used in the 50 ml reaction mixtures with 2 units of Pwo-polymerase, 0.1 mM dNTPs and 2 mM MgS04. For both reactions , temperature cycling was carried out as foUows: 94°C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94°C (1 minute), 50°C (1 minute), 72""C (2 minutes).<br>

For fusion of the two PCR fragments by PCR 100 pmol of primers EcoRIHBcAgCs) and HBcAg(l-149)Hind(as) were used with 100 ng of the two purified PCR firagments in a 50 ml reaction mixture containing 2 units of Pwo polymerase. 0.1 mM dNTPs and 2 mM MgS04. PCR cycling conditions were: 94""C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94°C (1 minute), 50°C (1 minute), 72°C (2 minutes). The assembled PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified and digested for 19 hours in an propriate buffer with EcoRI and HindDI restriction enzymes. The digested DNA fragment was ligated into EcoRI/Hindni-digested pKK vector to generate pKK-HBcAg-Lys expression vector. Insertion of the PCR product into the vector was analyzed by EcoRI/HindHI restriction analysis and DNA sequencing of the insert.<br>
EXAMPLE 24 Expression and partial purification of HBcAg-Lys<br><br>
E. coli strain XL-1 blue was transformed with pKK-HBcAg-Lys. 1 ml of an overnight culture of bacteria was used to innoculate 100 ml of LB medium containing 100 /ig/ml ampicillin. This culture was grown for 4 hours at 37°C until an OD at 600 nm of approximately 0.8 was reached. Induction of the synthesis of HBcAg-Lys was performed by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. After induction, bacteria were fUrther shaken at 37°C for 16 hours. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 15 minutes. TTie pellet was frozen at -20°C. The pellet was thawed and resuspended in bacteria lysis buffer (10 mM Na2HP04, pH 7.0, 30 mM NaQ, 0.25% Tween-20, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT) supplemented with 200 fig/ml lysozyme and 10 (i\ of Benzonase (Merck). Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and disrupted using a French pressure cell. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the lysate was incubated for 30 minutes on ice and shaken occasionally. E. coli cells hartioring pKK-HBcAg-Lys expression plasmid or a control plasmid were used for induction of HBcAg-Lys expression with IPTG. Prior to the addition of lETG, a sample was removed fi:om the bacteria culture carrying the pKK-HBcAg-Lys plasmid and from a culture carrying the control plasmid. Sixteen hours after addition of IPTG, samples were again, removed from the culture containing pKK-HBcAg-Lys and from the control culture. Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining.<br>
The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 12,000 x g in order to remove insoluble cell debris. TTie supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against HBcAg (YVS1841, purchased from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY. USA), indicating that a significant amount of HBcAg-Lys protein was soluble. Briefly, lysates from E. coli cells expressmg HBcAg-Lys and from control cells were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 30 minutes. Supernatant (= soluble fraction) and pellet (= insoluble firaction) were separated and diluted with SDS sample buffer to equal volumes. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-HBcAg monoclonal antibody YVS 1841.<br>
The cleared cell lysate was used for step-gradient centrifugation using a sucrose step gradient consisting of a 4 ml 65% sucrose solution overlaid with 3 ml 15% sucrose solution followed by 4 ml of bacterial lysate. Ths sample was centrifuged for 3 hrs with 100,000 x g at 4°C. After centrifrigation, 1 ml fractions from the top of the gradient were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The HBcAg-Lys protein was delected by Coomassie staining.<br>
The HBcAg-Lys protein was enriched at the intoface between 15 and 65% sucrose indicating that it had formed a capsid particle.  Most of the bacterial<br><br>
proteins remained in the sucrose-free upper layer of the gradient, therefore step-gradient centrifugatiion of the HBcAg-Lys particles led both to enrichment and to a partial purification of the particles.<br>

Synthetic FLAG peptide with a Cysteine residue at its amino terminus (amino acid sequence CGGDYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO; 147)) was coupled chemically to purified HBcAg-Lys particles in order to elicit an immune response against the FLAG peptide. 600 ml of a 95% pure solution of HBcAg-Lys particles (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the heterobifunctional cross-linker N-Succinimidyl 3-
The FLAG decorated particles were injected into mice.<br>

The gpl40 gene was amplified by PCR from pCytTSgpl40FOS using oligos gpl40CysEcoRI and Sallgpl40. For the PCRs, 100 pmol of each oligo and 50 ng of the template DNAs were used in the 50 ml reaction mixtures with 2 units of Pwo polymerase, 0.1 mM dNTPs and 2 mM MgS04. For both reactions, temperature cycling was carried out as follows: 94""C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94°C (0.5 minutes). 55°C (0.5 minutes), 72""C (2 minutes).<br>

EXAMPLE 27 Expression of pMPSVgpMOCys<br>
pMPSVgpl40Cys (20 fig) was linearized by restriction digestion. The reaction was stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by an isopropanol precipitation of the linearized DNA. The restriction digestion was evaluated by agarose gel eletrophoresis. For the transfection, 5.4 fig of linearized pMPSVgpl40-Cys was mixed with 0.6 fig of linearized pSV2Neo in 30 110 and 30 /il of 1 M CaChsolution was added. After addition of 60 /il phosphate buffer (50 mM HEPES, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Nai HPO4, pH 7.05), the solution was vortexed for 5 seconds, followed by an incubation at room temperature for 25 seconds. The solution was immediately added to 2 ml HP-1 medium containing 2% PCS (2% PCS medium). The medium of an 80% confluent BHK21 cell culture (6-well plate) was then replaced by the DNA containing medium. After an incubation for 5 hours at 37°C in a CO2 incubator, the DNA containing medium was removed and replaced by 2 ml of 15% glycerol in 2% PCS medium. The ycerol containing medium was removed after a 30 second incubation phase, and the cells were washed by rinsing with 5 ml of HP-1 medium containing 10% PCS. Fmally 2 ml of fresh HP-1 medium containing 10% PCS was added.<br>
Stably transfected cells were selected and grown in selection medium (HP-1 medium supplemented witii G418) at 37""C in a CO2 incubator. When the mixed population was grown to confluency, the culture was split to two dishes, followed by a 12 h growtii period at 37°C. One dish of the cells was shifted to 30°C to induce the expression of soluble GP140-FOS. The other dish was kept at 37""C.<br>
The expression of soluble GP140-Cys was determined by Western blot analysis. Culture media (0.5 ml) was methanol/chloroform precipitated, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffo-. Samples were heated for 5 minutes at<br><br>
95""C before being applied to a 15% acrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Protan nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Germany) as described by Bass and Yang, in Creighton, T.E., ed., Protein Function: A Practical Approach, 2nd Edn., IRL Press, Oxford (1997), pp. 29-55. The membrane was blocked with 1 % bovine albumin (Sigma) in TBS (lOxTBS per liter: 87.7 g NaCl, 66.1 g Trizma hydrochloride (Sigma) and 9.7 g Tiizma base (Sigma), pH 7.4) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by an incubation with an anti-GP140 or GP-160 antibody for 1 hour. The blot was washed 3 times for 10 minutes with TBS-T (TBS with 0.05% Tween20), and incubated for 1 hour with an alkaline-phosphatase-anti-mouse/rabbit/monkey/human IgO conjugate. After washing 2 times for 10 minutes with TBS-T and 2 times for 10 minutes with TBS, the development reaction was carried out using alkaline phosphatase detection reagents (10 ml AP buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM Naa. pH 9.5) with 50 /il NET solution (7.7% Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (Sigma) in 70% dimethylformamide) and 37 fi\ of X-Phosphate solution (5% of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in dimethylformamide).<br>
EXAMPLE 28 Purification of gpl40Cys<br>
An anti-gpl20 antibody was covalently coupled to a NHS/EDC activated dextran and packed into a chromatography column. The supernatant, containing GP140Cy5 is loaded onto the column and after sufficient washing, GP140Cy5 was eluted using 0.1 M HCl. The eluate was directly neutralized during collection using 1 M Tris pH 7.2 in the collection tubes.<br>
Disulfide bond fonnation might occur during purification, therefore the collected sample is treated with 10 mM DTT in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 for 2 hours at 25°C.<br>
DTT is remove by subsequent dialysis against 10 mM Mes; 80 mM NaCl pH 6.0. Hnally GP140Cys is mixed with alphavirus particles containing the JUN residue in E2 as described in Example 16.<br>

The PLA3 gene was amplified by PCR from pAV3PLAfos using oligos EcoRIPLA and PLA-Cys-hind. For the PCRB, 100 pmol of each oligo and 50 ng of the template DNAs were used in the 50 ml reaction mixtures with 2 units of Pwo polymerase, 0.1 mM dNTPs and 2 mM MgS04. For the reaction, temperature cycling was carried out as follows: 94°C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94°C (0.5 minutes), 55°C (0.5 minutes), 72°C (2 minutes).<br>

EXAMPLE 30 Expression and Purification of PLA2-Cys<br><br>
For cytoplasmic production of Cys tagged proteins, E. coli XL-1-Blue strain was transformed with the vectors pAV3::PLA and pPIA-Cys. The culture was incubated in rich medium in the presence of ampicillin at 37°C with shaking. At an optical density (550nm) of, 1 mM IPTG was added and incubation was continued for another 5 hours. The cells were harvested by centrifiigation, resuspended in an appropriate buffer {e.g., Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl) containing DNase, RNase and lysozyme, and disrupted by passage through a french pressure cell. After centrifiigation (Sorvall RC-5C, SS34 rotor, 15000 ipm, 10 niin, 4°C), the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml inclusion body wash buffer (20 mM tris-HCl, 23% sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, pH8) at 4°C and recentrifuged as described above. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant after centrifugation was essentially clear. Inclusion bodies were resuspended in 20 ml solubilization buffer (5.5 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 25 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and subsequent passage of the supernatant through a sterile filter (0.45 fxm). The protein solution was kept at 4°C for at least 10 hours in the presence of 10 mM EDTA and 100 mM DTT and then dialyzed three times against 10 volumes of 5.5 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 25 mM tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 6. The solution was dialyzed twice against 51 2 M urea, 4 mM "SUVA, 0.1 M NHiCl, 20 mM sodium borate (pH 8.3) m die presence of an )propriate redox shuffle (oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione; cystine/cysteine). The refolded protein was then applied to an ion exchange chromatography. The protein was stored in an appropriate buffer with a pH above 7 in the presence of 2-10 mM DTT to keep the cysteine residues in a reduced form. Prior to coupling of the protein with die alphavirus particles, DTT was removed by passage of the protein solution through a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column.<br>
EXAMPLE 31 Construction of a HBcAg devoid of fiee cysteine residues and containing<br>
an inserted lysine residue<br>
A Hepatitis core Antigen (HBcAg), referred to herein as HBcAg-lys-2cys-Mut, devoid of cysteine residues at positions corresponding to 48 and 107 in SEQ E) NO:134 and containing an inserted lysine residue was constructed using the following methods.<br>
The two mutations were introduced by first separately amplifying three ftagments of the HBcAg-Lys gene prepared as described above in Example 23 with the following PCR primer combinations. PCR methods essentially as described in Example 1 and conventional cloning techniques were used to prepare the HBcAg-lys-2cys-Mut gene.<br><br>

Fragments 1 and 2 were then combined with PCR primers EcoRIHBcAg(s) and 107as to give fragnaent 4. Fragment 4 and fragnnt 3 were then combined with primers EcoRIHBcAg(s) and HBcAgl49hind-as to produce the full length gene. The full length gene was then digested with the EcoRI (GAATTC) and Hindm (AAGCTT) enzymes and cloned into the pKK vector (Pharmacia) cut at the same restriction sites.<br>
EXAMPLE 32 Blockage of free cysteine residues of a HBcAg followed by cross-Hnking<br>
The free cysteine residues of the HBcAg-Lys prepared as described above in Example 23 were blocked using lodacetamide. The blocked HBcAg-Lys was then cross-linked to the FLAG peptide with the hero-bifunctional cross-linker m-maleimidonbenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sulfo-MBS).<br><br>
ITie methods used to block the free cysteine residues and cross-link the HBcAg-Lys are as follows. HBcAg-Lys (550 g/ml) was reacted for 15 minutes at room temperature with lodacetamide (Fluka Chemie, Brugg, Switzerland) at a concentration of 50 mM in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride), pH7.2, in a total volume of 1 ml. The so modified HBcAg-Lys was then reacted iramediately with Sulfo-MBS (Piense) at a concentration of 330 iiM directly in the reaction mixture of step 1 for 1 hour at room temperature. TTie reaction mixture was then cooled on ice, and dialyzed against 1000 volumes of PBS pH 7.2. The dialyzed reaction mixture was finally reacted with 300 ;iM of the FLAG peptide (CGGDYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO: 147)) containing an N-terminal free cysteine for coupling to the activated HBcAg-Lys, and loaded on SDS-PAGE for analysis.<br>
Tlie resulting patterns of bands on the SDS-PAGE gel showed a clear additional band migrating slower than the control HBcAg-Lys derivatized with the cross-UnkCT, but not reacted with the FLAG peptide. Reactions done under the same conditions without prior derivatization of the cysteines with lodacetamide led to complete cross-linking of monomers of the HBcAg-Lys to higher molecular weight species.<br>

A.       Introduction<br>
Bacterial piU or fimbriae are filamentous surface organelles produced by a wide range of bacteria. These organelles mediate the attachment of bacteria to surface receptors of host cells and are required for the establishment of many bacterial infections like cystitis, pyelonephritis, new bom meningitis and diarrhea.<br>
PiU can be divided in different classes with respect to their receptor specificity (agglutination of blood cells from different species), their assembly pathway (extracellular nucleation, general secretion, chaperone/usher, altemate chaperone) and their morphological properties (thick, rigid pili; thin, flexible pili; atypical structures including capsule; curli; etc). Examples of thick, rigid pili forming a rit handed helix that are assembled via the so called ch)erone/usher pathway and mediate adhesion to host glycoproteins include Type-1 pili, P-pili, S-pili, FlC-pili, and 987P-pili). The most prominent and best characterized member of this class of pili are P-pili and Type-1 pili (for reviews on adhesive stmctures, their assembly and the associated diseases see Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., /. Bacteriol i8J:1059-1071<br><br>
(1999); BulUtt &amp; Makowski, Biophys. J. 74:623-632 (1998); Hung, D. L. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., /. Struct, Biol 224:201-220 (1998)).<br>
Type-1 pili are long, filamentous polymeric protein structures on the surface of E. coli. They possess adhesive properties that allow for binding to mannose-containing receptors present on the surface of certain host tissues. Type-1 piU can be expressed by 70-80% of all E. coli isolates and a single E. coli cell can tear up to 500 pili. Type- pili reach a length of typically 0.2 to 2 fiM with an average number of 1000 protein subunits that associate to a right-handed helix with 3.125 subunits per turn with a diameter of 6 to 7 mu and a central hole of 2.0 to 2.5 nm.<br>
The main Type-1 pilus component, FimA, which represents 98% of the total pilus protein, is a J5.8 kDa protein. The minor pilus components FimF, FimG and FimH are incorporated at the tip and in regular distances along the pilus shaft (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type I fimbriae of Escherichia coli," in: Fimbriae. Klemm, P. (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). FimH, a 29.1 kDa protein, was shown to be the mannose-binding adhesin of Type-1 pih (Krogfelt, K. A., et al, Infect. Immun. 5S:1995-1998 (1990); Klemm, P., et al., Mol. Microbiol. 4:553-56Q (1990); Hanson. M. S. &amp; Brinton, C. C. J., Nature I7:265~26S (1988)), and its incorporation is probably facilitated by FmnG and FimF (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol. Gen. Genetics 206:439-445 (1987); Russell, P. W. &amp; Omdorff. P. B., /. Bacterial. 774:5923-5935 (1992)). Recently, it was shown that FimH might also fOTm a thin tip-fibrillum at the end of the pili (Jones, C. H-, et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 92:2081-2085 (1995)). The order of major and minor components in the individual mature piU is very similar, indicating a highly ordered assembly process (Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. L, J. Bacterial 181:1059-1011 (1999)).<br>
P-piU of E. coli are of very similar architecture, have a diameter of 6.8 nm, an axial hole of 1.5 nm and 3.28 subunits per turn (Bullitt &amp; Makowski, Biophys. J. 74:623-632 (1998)). The 16.6 M5a PapA is the main component of this pilus type and shows 36% sequence identity and 59% similarity to FimA (see Table 1). As in Tjfpe-l pili the 36.0 kDa P-pilus adhesin PapG and specialized adapter proteins make up only a tiny fraction of total pilus protem. The most obvious difference to Type-1 piB is the absence of the adhesin as an integral part of the pilus rod, and its exclusive localization in the tip fibrillium that is connected to the pilus rod via specialized adapter proteins that Type-1 pili lack (Hultgren, S. J., et al., Cell 75:887-901 (1993)).<br><br>

Type-1 pili are extraordinary stable hetero-oligomeric complexes. Neither SDS-treatment nor protease digestjons, boiling or addition of denaturing agents can dissociate Type-1 pili into their individual protein components. The combination of different methods like incubation at 100°C at pH 1.8 was initially found to allow for the depolymeri2ation and separation of the components (Eshdat, Y., etal., J. Bacteriol i4S:308-314 (1981); Brinton, C.C. J., Trans. N. Y. Acad Sci, 27:1003-1054 (1965); Hanson, A. S., et al., J. Bacteriol, 770:3350-3358 (1988); Hemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type I fimbriae of Escherichia coli," in: Fimbriae. Hemm, P. (ed,), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). Interestingly, Type-1 pili show a tendency to break at positions where FmiH is incorporated upon mechanical agitation, resulting in fragments that present a FimH adhesin at their tips. This was interpreted as a mechanism of the bacterium to shorten pili to an effective length under mechanical stress (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type I fimbriae of Escherichia coli," in: Fimbriae. Klemm, P. (ed), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). Despite their extraordinary stability, Type-1 pili have been shown to unravel partially in the presence of 50% glycerol; they lose their helical structure and form an extended and flexible, 2 nm wide protein chain (Abraham, S. N., et al, J. Bacteriol. i74:5145-5148 (1992)).<br>
P-pili and Type-1 pili are encoded by single gene clusters on the E. coli chromosome of approximately 10 kb (Klemm, P. &amp; &amp;ogfelt, K. A., "Type I fimbriae of Escherichia coli" in: Fimbriae. Klemm, P. (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26; Omdoiff, P. E, &amp; Falkow, S., /. Bacteriol 160:61-66 (1984)). A total of nine genes are found in the Type-1 pilus gene cluster, and 11 genes in the P-pUus<br><br>
cluster (Hultgren, S. J., et al.. Adv. Prot. Chem. 44:99-123 (1993)). Both clusters are organized quite similarly.<br>
The first two m-genes, fimB and fimE, code for recombinases involved in the regulation of pilus expression CNlcClain, M. S., et al., J. Bacteriol. 775:5308-5314 (1991)). The main structural pilus protein is encoded by the next gene of the cluster, yimA (Klemm. P., Euro. J. Biochem. 743:395-400 (1984); Omdorff, P. E. &amp; Falkow, S., /. Bacteriol 160:61-66 (1984); Omdorff, P. E. &amp; FaUcow, S., J. Bacteriol 162:454-451 (1985)). TTie exact role of fiml is unclear. It has been reported to be incorporated in the pilus as well (Klemin, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type I fimbriae of Escherichia coU" in: Fimbriae. Klemm, P. (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). The adjacent fimC codes not for a structural component of the mature pUus, but for a so-called pilus chierone that is essential for the pilus assembly (Klemm, P., Res. Microbiol 743:831-838 (1992); Jones, C. H., et al, Proc. Nat. Acad Sci. C/SA 90:8397-8401 (1993)).<br>
Hie assembly platform in the outer bacterial membrane to which the mature pilus is anchored is encoded by JlmD (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol. Gen, Genetics 220:334-338 (1990)). The three niinor components of the Type-1 pili, FimF, FimG and RmH are encoded by the last three genes of the cluster (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol Gen. Genetics 205:439-445 (1987)). Apart from fimB and fimE, all genes encode precursor proteins for secretion into the periplasm via the sec-pathway.<br>
The similarities between different pili following the chaperone/usher pathway are not restricted to their morphological properties. Their genes are also arranged in a very similar manner. Generally the gene for the main structural subunit is found directly downstream of the regulatory elements at the beginning of the gene cluster, followed by a gene for an additional structural subunit (ftml in the case of Type-1 piliandpfgsTJinthecaseof P-pili). PapHwas shown and Kml is supposed to terminate pilus assembly (Hultgren, S. J., et al., Cell 75:887-901 (1993)). The two proteins that guide the process of pilus formation, namely the specialized pilus chaperone and the outer membrane assembly platform, are located adjacently downstream. At the end of the clusters a variable number of minor pilus components including the adhesins are encoded. The similarities in morphological structure, sequence (see Table 1), genetic organization and regulation indicate a close evolutionary relationship and a similar assembly process for these cell oi;ganeUes.<br>
Bacteria producing Type-1 pili show a so-called phase-variation. Either the bacteria are fully piliated or bald. This is achieved by an inversion of a 314 bp genomic DNA fragment containing the fimA promoter, thereby inducing an "all on" or "all off" expression of the pilus genes (McClain, M. S., et al., J. Bacteriol<br><br>
775:5308-5314 (1991)). The coupling of the expression of the other structural pilus genes to fimA expression is achieved by a still unknown mechanism. However, a wide range of studies elucidated the mechanism that influences the switching between the two phenotypes.<br>
The first two genes of the Type-1 pilus cluster, fimB and fimE encode recombinases that recognize 9 bp DNA segments of dyad symmetry that flank the invertable jimA promoter. Whereas FimB switches pilation "on", FimE turns the promoter in the "off" orientation. The up- or down-regulation of cithNfimB OTJWIE exjHtssion therefore controls the position of the so-called "_m-switch" (McOain, M. S.. et al.. J. Bactenol. iZ?:5308-5314 (1991); Blomfield, L C. et al.. J. Bacterial 173:529-5301 (1991%<br>
TTie two regulatory proteins fimB and fimE are transcribed from distinct promoters and their transcription was shown to be influenced by a wide range of different factors including the integration host factor (IHF) (Blomfield, I. C, et cd., Mol. Microbiol. 25:705-717 (1997)) and the leucine-tesponsive regulatory protein (UIP) (Blomfield, I. C, et al., J. Bactenol i 75:27-36 (1993); Gaily, D. L., et al. J. Bacterial 175:6186-6193 (1993); Gaily, D. L., et al., Microbiol 2i:725-738 (1996); Roesch, R. L. &amp; Blomfield, 1. C, Mol Microbiol 27:751-761 (1998)). Mutations in the former lock the bacteria either in "on" or "off" phase, whereas LRP mutants switch with a reduced frequency. In addition, an effect of leuX on pilus biogenesis has been shown. This gene is located in the vicinity of die fim-genes on the chromosome and codes for the minor leucine tRNA species for the UUG codon. WhencasfimB contains five UUG codons,yOTLE contains only two, and enhanced leuX transcription might favor FimB over FimE expression (Buroff, R. L., et al, Infect. Imnmn. 6i:1293-1300 (1993); Newman, J. V., et al, FEMS Microbiol Lett. 122:281-287 (1994); Ritter, A., et oL. Mol Microbial, 25:871-882 (1997)).<br>
Furthermore, temperature, medium conKJsition and other environmental factors were shown to influence the activity of FimB and FimE. Finally, a spontaneous, statistical switching of the fimA promoter has been reported. The frequency of this spontaneous switching is approximately 10" per generation (Eisenstein, B. L, Science 214:337-339 (1981); Abraham, S. M., et al, Proa. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 52:5724-5727 (1985)), but is strongly influenced by the above mentioned factors.<br>
The genes _7«i andmC are also transcribed from the/imA promoter, but iMrectly downstream of fimA a DNA segment with a strong tendency to form secondary structure was identified which probably represents a partial transcription terminator (Klemm, P., Euro. J. Biochem. 75:395-400 (1984)); and is therefore supposed to severely reducem/ and mC transcription.   At the 3" end offimC an<br><br>
additional promoter controls the fimD transcription; at the 3" end at fimD the last known fim promoter is located that regulates the levels of RmF, FimG, and FimH. Thus, all of the minor Type-1 pili proteins are transcribed as a single mRNA (Klemm, P. &amp; Krogfelt, K. A., "Type I fimbriae of Escherichia coii," in: Fimbriae. Klemm, P. (ed.), CRC Press Inc., (1994) pp. 9-26). This ensures a 1:1:1 stoichiometry on mRNA-level, which is probably maintained on the protein level.<br>
In the case of P-pili additional regulatory mechanisms were found when the half-life of mRNA was determined for different P-pilus genes. ITie mRNA for papA was extraordinarily long-lived, whereas the mRNA for papB, a regulatory pilus protein, was encoded by short-lived mRNA (Naureckiene, S. &amp; Uhlin. B. E., Mot Microbiol. 27:55-68 {1996); Nilsson, P., et al., J. Bacterial. 77S:683-690 (1996)).<br>
In the case of Type-1 pili, the gene for die Type-1 pilus chaperone FimC starts with a GTG instead of an ATG codon, leading to a reduced translation efficiency. Finally, analysis oftheimH gene revealed atendency of the yimH mRNA to form a stem-loop, which might severely hamper translation. In summary, bacterial pilus biogenesis is regulated by a wide range of different mechanisms acting on all levels of protein biosynthesis.<br>
Periplasmic pilus proteins are generally synthesized as precursors, contwning a N-terminal signal-sequence that allows translocation across the inner membrane via the Sec-apparatus. After translocation the precursors are normally cleaved by signal-peptidase I. Structural Type-1 pilus subunits normally contain disulfide bonds, their formation is catalyzed by DsbA and possibly DsbC and DsbQ gene products.<br>
The Type-1 pilus chaperone FimC lacks cysteine residues. In contrast, the chaperone of P-pili, PapD, is tiie only membCT of the pilus chaperone family that contains a disulfide bond, and the dependence of P-pili on DsbA has been shown explicitly (Jacob-Dubuisson, F., et al.. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci USA 97:21552-11556 (1994)). PapD does not accumulate in the periplasm of a AdsbA strain, indicating that the disturbance of the P-pilus assembly machinery is caused by the absence of tiifc chaperone (Jacob-Dubuisson, F., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 97:11552-11556 (1994)). This is in accordance with the finding that Type-1 pili are still assembled in a AdsbA strain, albeit to reduced level (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia colt and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756).<br>
Type-1 pili as well as P-pili are to 98% made of a single or main structural subunit termed FimA and PapA, respectively. Both proteins have a size of ~15.5 kDa. The additional minor components encoded in the pilus gene clusters are<br><br>
very similar (see Table 1). The similarities in sequence and size of the subunits with the exception of the adhesins suggest that all share an identical folding motif, and differ oivly with respect to their affinity towards each other. Especially the N- and C-terminal regions of these proteins are well conserved and supposed to play an important role in chaperone/subunit interactions as well as in subunit/subunit interactions within the pilus (Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., / Bacteriol. 181:1059-1071 (1999)). Interestingly, the conserved N-terminal segment can be found in the naiddle of the pilus adhesins, indicating a two-domain organization of the adhesins where the proposed C-terminal domain, starting with the conserved motif, corresponds to a structural pilus subunit whereas the N-terminal domain was shown to be responsible for recognition of host cell receptors (Hultgren, S. J., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA S6;4357-4361 (1989); Haslam, D. B., etal., Mol. Microbiol. 14:399-409 (1994); Soto, G. E., et al., EMBO J. 17:6155-6161 (1998)). The different subunits were also shown to influence the morphological properties of the pili. The removal of several genes was reported to reduce the number of Type-1 or P-pili or to . increase their length, {fimH, papG, papK, fimF, fimG) (Russell, P. W. &amp; Omdorff, P. E., J. Bacteriol. 174:5923-5935 (1992); Jacob-Dubuisson, R., et al, EMBO J. i2:837-847 (1993); Soto, G. E. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., J. Bactenol 757:1059-1071 (1999)); combination of the gene deletions amplified these effects or led to a total loss of pilation (Jacob-Dubuisson, R., et al, EMBO J. 72:837-847 (1993)).<br>
In non-fmibrial adhesive cell organelles also assembled via cherones/usher systems such as Myf fimbriae and CS3 pili, the conserved C-terminal region is different. This indirectly proves the importance of these C-tenninal subunit segments for quaternary interactions (Hultgren, S. I., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756).<br>
Gene deletion studies proved that removal of the pilus chaperones leads to a total loss of piliation in P-pili and Type-1 pili (Lindberg, F., et al, J. Bactenol 777:6052-6058 (1989); Hemm, P., Res. Microbiol 745:831-838 (1992); Jones, C. H., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad Sd. USA 90:8397-8401 (1993)). Periplasmic extracts of a AfimC strain showed the accumulation of the main subunit RmA, but no pili could be detected (Klemm, P., Res. Microbiol 745:831-838 (1992)). Attempts to over-express individual P-pilus subunits failed and only proteolytically degraded forms could be detected in the absence of PapD; in addition, the P-pilus adhesin was purified with the inner membrane fiaction in the absence of the chaperone (Lindberg, F., et al., J. Bacteriol 777:6052-6058 (1989)). However, co-expression of the structural pilus proteins and their chaperone allowed the detection of chjerCHie/subunit complexes fiwrn the periplasm in the case of the FimC/FimH<br><br>
conlex as well as in the case of different Pap-proteins including the adhesin PapG and the main subunit PapA (Tewari, R., et al., J. Biol Chem. 265:3009-3015 (1993); Lindberg, F., et al.. J. Bactenol. J7i:6052-6058 (1989)). The affinity of chaperone/subunit complexes towards their assembly platform has also been investigated in vitro and was found to differ strongly (Dodson et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 90:3670-3674 (1993)). From diese results the following functions were suggested for the pilus chaperones.<br>
They are assumed to recognize unfolded pilus subunits, prevent dieir aggregation and to provide a "folding template" that guides the formation of a native structure.<br>
The folded subunits, which after folding display surfaces that allow subunit/subunit interactions, are then expected to be shielded from interacting with other subunits, and to be kept in a monomelic, assembly-competent state.<br>
Finally, the pilus chaperones are supposed to allow a triggered relee of the subunits at the outer membrane assembly location, and, by doing so with different efficiency, influence the composition and order of the mature pili (see also the separate section below).<br>
After subunit release at the outer membrane, the cherone is free for another round of substrate binding, folding assistance, subunit transport through the periplasm and specific delivery to the assembly site. Since the periplasm lacks energy sources, like ATP, the whole pilus assembly process must be thennodynamicaUy driven (Jacob-Dubuisson, F., et al.. Proc. Nat. Acad Sci. USA 9J:11552-11556 (1994)). The wide range of different ftmctions attributed to the pilus chaperones would implicate an extremely fine tuned cascade of steps.<br>
Several findings, however, are not readily explained with the model of pilus chaperone function outlined above. One example is the existence of multimeric chaperone/subunit complexes (Striker, R. T., et al.. J. Biol Chem. 259:12233-12239 (1994)), where one chaperone binds subunit dimers or trimers. It is difficult to imagine a folding template that can be "double-booked". The studies on the molecular details of chaperone/subunit interaction (see below) partially supported the functions smnmarized above, but also raised new questions.<br>
AH" 31 periplasmic chaperones identified by genetic studies or sequence analysis so far are proteins of jproximately 25 kDa with conspicuously high pi values around 10. Ten of these chaperones assist the assembly of rod-like pili, four are involved in the formation of thin pili, ten are important for the biogenesis of atypically thin structures (including capsule-like structures) and two adhesive structures have not been determined so far (Holmgren, A., et al., EMBO J. Ji:1617-1622 (1992); Bonci, A., et al., J. Mot Evolution 44:299-309 (1997); Smyth,<br><br>
C. J., el al, FEUS Immun. Med Microbiol. 26:127-139 (1996); Hung, D. L. &amp; Hultgren, S. J., J. Struct, Biol. 724:201-220 (1998)). The pairwise sequence identity between these chaperones and PapD ranges from 25 to 56%, indicating an identical overall fold (Hung, D. h., et al.. EMBO J. 75:3792-3805 (1996)).<br>
The first studies on the mechanism of chaperone/substrate recognition was based on the observation that the C-tennini of all known pilus chaperones are extremely similar. Synthetic peptides conesponding to the C-termini of the P-pilus proteins were shown to bind to PapD in EUSA assays (Kuehn, M. J., et al. Science 262:1234-1241 (1993)). Most importantly, the X-ray structures of two complexes were solved in which PapD was co-crystallized with 19-residue peptides corresponding to the C-tennini of either the adhesin P)G or the minor pilus component PapK (Kuehn, M. J., et al., Science 262:1234-1241 (1993); Soto, G. E., et al, EMBO J. 77:6155-6167 (1998)). Both peptides bound in an extended conformation to a p-strand in the N-terminal chaperone domain that is oriented towards the inter-domain cleft, thereby extending a P-sheet by an additional strand. The C-teiminal carboxylate groups of the peptides were anchored via hydrogen-bonds to Arg8 and Lysll2, these two residues are invariant in the family of pilus chaperones. Mutagenesis studies confirmed their importance since their exchange against alanine resulted in accumulation of non-functional pilus chierone in the periplasm (Slonim, L. N., et al, EMBO J. 77:4747756 (1992)). The crystal structure of PapD indicates that neither ArgS nor Lysll2 is involved in stabilization of the chaperone, but completely solvent exposed (Holmgren, A. &amp; Branden, C. I., Nature 542:248-251 (1989)). On the substrate side the exchange of C-tenninal PapA residues was reported to abohsh P-pilus formation, and similar experiments on the conserved C-tenninal segment of the P-pilus adhesin PapG prevented its inccaporation into the P-pilus (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756). All evidence therefore indicated pilus subimit recognition via the C-terminal segments of the subunits.<br>
A more recent study on C-terminal amino acid exchanges of the P-pilus adhesin PapG gave a more detailed picture. A range of amino acid substitutions at the positions -2, -4, -6, and -8 relative to the C-terminus were tolerated, but changed pilus stability (Soto, G. E., et al., EMBO J. 77:6155-6167 (1998)).<br>
Still, cffltain problems arise when this mode! is examined more closely. Adhesive bacterial structures not assembled to rigid, rod-like pili lack the conserved C-terminal segments (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756), even though they are also dependent on the presence of<br><br>
related pilus chaperones. "Hiis indicates a different general role for the C-terminal segments of pilus subunits, namely the mediation of quaternary interactions in the mature pilus. Moreover, the attempt to solve the structure of a C-terminal peptide in complex with the chaperone by NMR was severely hampered by the weak binding of the peptide to the chaperone (Walse, B., et al, FEBS Lett. 412:115-120 (1997)); whereas an essential contribution of the C-termlnal segments for chaperone recognition implies relatively high affinity interactions.<br>
An additional problem arises if the variability between the different subunits are taken into account Even though the C-terminal segments are conserved, a wide range of conservative substitutions is found. For example, 15 out of 19 amino acid residues differ between the two peptides co-crystallizfid with PD (Soto, G. E., et at., EMBO J. 77:6155-6167 (1998)). This has been explained by the kind of interaction between chaperone and substrate, that occurs mainly via backbone interactions and not specifically via side-chain interactions. Then again, the specificity of the chaperone for certain substrates is not readily explained. On the contrary to the former argument, the conserved residues have been taken as a proof for the specificity (Hultgren, S. J., et al., "Bacterial Adhesion and Their Assembly", in: Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Neidhardt, F. C. (ed.) ASM Press, (1996) pp. 2730-2756).<br>
The outer membrane assembly platform, also termed "ushta" in the literatures, is fonned by homo-oligomers of FiniD or P)C, in the case of Type-1 and P-pili, respectively (Klemm, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol Gen, Genetics 220:34-338 (1990); Thanassi, D. G., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sei. USA 95:3146-3151 (1998)). Studies on the elongation of Type-1 fimbriae by electron microscopy demonstrated an elongation of the pilus from the base (Lowe, M. A., et al., J. Bacterial 765:157-163 (1987)). In contrast to the secretion of unfolded subunits into the periplasmic space, the fuUy folded jMoteins have to be translocated through the outer membrane, possibly in an oligomeric form (Tlianassi, D. G., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sei. USA 95:3146-3151 (1998)). This requires first a membrane pore wide enough to allow the passage and second a transport mechanism that is thermodynamically driven (Jacob-Dubuisson,F.,era/., / Biol Chem. 269:12447-12455 (1994)).<br>
FimD expression alone was shown to have a deleterious effect on bacterial growth, the co-expression of pilus subunits could restore normal growth behavior (KlEaran, P. &amp; Christiansen, G., Mol. Gen, Genetics 220:334-338 (1990)). Based on this it can be concluded that the ushers probably form pores that are completely filled by the pilus. Electron microscopy on membrane vesicles in which PapC had been incorporated confirmed a pore-forming structure with an inner diameta: of 2 nm (Thanassi, D. G., et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sei USA 95:3146-3151<br><br>
(1998)), Since the inner diameter of the pore is too small to allow the passage of a pilus rad, it has been suggested that the helical airangement of the mature pilus is formed st the outside of the bacterial surface. The finding that glycerol leads to unraveling of pill which then form a protein chain of Eproximately 2 ran is in good agreement with this hypothesis, since an extended chain of subunits mit be formed in the pore as a first step (Abraham, S. N., et al., J. Bacterial. i74:5145-5148 (1992); Thanassi, D. G., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Set USA 95:3146-3151 (1998)). The formation of the helical pilus rod at the outside of the bacterial membrane might then be the driving force responsible for translocation of the growing pilus through the membrane.<br>
It has also been demonstrated that the usher proteins of Type-1 and P-pili form ternary complexes with chaperone/subunit complexes with different afBnities (Dodson, K. W.. et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Set USA 90:3670-3674 (1993); Sauliiro, E. T., et al., EMBO J. i7-.2177-2185 (1998)). This was interpreted as "kinetic partitioning" that allows a defined order of pilus proteins in the pilus. Moreover, it has been suggested that stmctural proteins mit present a binding surface only compatible with one other type of pilus protein; this would be another mechanism to achieve a highly defined order of subunits in the mature pilus (Saulino, E. T., etal., EMBO J. 77:2177-2185 (1998)).<br><br>
B.       Production of Type-1 pili from Escherichia coli<br>
E. coli strain WSllO was spread on LB (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCI, pH 7.5. 1 % agar (w/v)) plates and incubated at 37°C overnight. A single colony was then used to inoculate 5 ml of LB starter culture (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl, pH 7.5). After incubation for 24 hours under conditions that favor bacteria that produce Type-1 pili (37°C, without agitation) 5 shaker flasks containing 1 liter LB were inoculated with one milliliter of the starter culture. The bacterial cultures were then incubated for additional 48 to 72 houra at 37°C without agitation. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 4""C, 10 minutes) and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 250 milliliters of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Pili were detached from the bacteria by 5 minutes agitation in a conventional mixer at 17.000 rpm-After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C the pili containing supernatant was collected and 1 M MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 100 mM. The solution was kept at 4°C for 1 hour, and the precipitated pili were then pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4°C). The peUet was then resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and the pilus solution was then clarified by a final centrifugation step to remove residual cell debris.<br>
C. Coupling of FLAG to purified Type-1 pUi of E. coli using m-Maleimidonbenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (sulfo-MBS)<br>
600 I of a 95% pure solution of bacterial Type-I pili (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the heterobifunctional cross-Unker sulfo-MBS (0.5 mM). Thereafter, the mixture was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 50 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 150 mM NaQ to remove free sulfo-MBS. Then 500 1 of the derivatized pili (2 mg/ml) were mixed with 0.5 mM FLAG peptide (containing an amino-terminal Cysteine) in the presence of 10 mM H)TA to prevent metal-catalyzed sufhydryloxidation. The non-coupled peptide was removed by size-exclusion-chromatogrhy.<br>

EXAMPLES! Construction of HBcAgl-183Lys<br>
Hepatitis core Antigen (HBcAg) 1-183 was modified as described in Example 23. A part of the c/el epitope (residues 72 to 88) region (Proline 79 and Alanine 80) was genetically replaced by the peptide Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (HBcAgl-183Lys construct). The introduced Lysine residue contains a reactive amino group in its side chain that can be used for intermolecular chemical crosslinldng of HBcAg particles with any antigen containing a free cysteine group. PCR methods essentially as described in Example 1 and conventional cloning techniques were used to prepare the HBcAgl-183Lys gene.<br>
The Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly sequence was inserted by ampling two separate fragments of the HBcAg gene ficom pEco63, as described above in Example<br><br>
23 and subsequently fusing the two fragments by PCR to assemble the full length gene. The following PCR primer combinations were used:<br>
fragment 1:<br>
Primer 1: EcoRIHBcAg(s) (see Example 23) Primer 2: Lys-HBcAg(as) (see Example23)<br>

HBcAgl-183Lys at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml (29 fiM) was treated with iodacetamide as described in Example 32. HBcAgl-183Lys was then reacted with a fifty-fold excess of the cross-linker Sulfo-MBS, as described in Example 32, and dialyzed overnight against 20mM Hepes, pH 7.2, at 4""C. Activated (derivatized) HBcAgl-183Lys was reacted with a five-fold molar excess of the peptide muTNFa (sequence: CGGVEEQLEWLSQR, diluted directiy into the HBcAgl-183Lys solution fit)m a 100 mM stock solution in DMSO) at RT for 4 hours. The coupling reaction (about 1 ml solution) was dialyzed against 2x 2 liters of 20mM HEPES pH 7.2, at 4°C, for 4 hours. The dialyzed coupling reaction was frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until immunization of the mice.<br>
Immunization<br><br>
Two mice (female Balb/c) were immunized intravenously at day 0 and 14 with 100 /ig HBcAgI-183Lys coupled to the muTNFa peptide, per animal, without adjuvant Antibodies specific for the muTNFa peptide (coated as a Ribonuclease A conjugate) and for native TNFa protein (Sigma) in the serum were determined at day 21 by ELISA.<br>
ELISA<br>
Murine TNFa protein (Sigma) was coated at a concentration of 2 /ig/ml. As a control, preimmune sera from the same mice used for immunization were tested. FIG. 14 shows the result of the ELISA experiment, demonstrating that inmranization with.HBcAgl-183Lys coupled to tiie muTNFa peptide (FuU length HBc-TNF) generated an immune response specific for the murine TNFa protein. The sera from mice bled on day 0 (preimmune) and 21 were tested at three different dilutions. Each bar is the average of the signal obtained with sera from two mice. Thus, vaccination with HBcAgl-183Lys coupled to the muTNFa peptide induced an immune response against a self-antigen, since the amino acid sequence of the muTNFa peptide is derived from the sequence of mouse TNFa protan.<br>

F.        EUSA<br>
AH three Ap peptides were individually coupled to bovine RNAse A using the chemical cross-linker SPDP as follows: a solution of 10 mg RNAse A in 2mL PBS (SOniM Phoshate buffer, 150mM NaCl pH 7.2) was reacted with 100  of a 20 mM SPDP solution in DMSO, at 25°C for 60 min. on a rocking shaker. Excess cross-hnker was separated from activated (deiivatized) RNAse A by gel filtration using a PD 10 column (Pharmacia). The protein containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 2 ml using centrifugal filters (5000 MWCO), A sample of 333 yd of the derivatized RNAse A solution was reacted with 2 il of the peptide stock solution (50 mM in DMSO). The coupling reaction was foUwed spectrophotometrically.<br>
ELISA plates were coated with RNAse A coupled to peptide at a concentration of 10 fig/ml. The plates were blocked and then incubated with serially diluted mouse sera. Bound antibodies were detected with enzymatically labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. Preimmune sera or control sera from mice immunized with unrelated peptides conjugated to QP, showed that the antibodies detected were specific for the respective peptide. FIG. 14A, FIG. 14B and FIG.14C, respectively, show ELISA analyses of IgG antibodies specific for "Ap 1-15", "Ap 1-27" and "Ap 33-<br><br>
42", respectively, in sera of mice immunized against "A 1-15", "Ap i-27" and "Ap 33-42", respectively, coupled to QP capsid protein. TTie denominations on the abscissa stand for the vaccine injected in the mice from which the sera are derived, and describe the peptide and the cross-Unker used to make the respective vaccine. All sera were measured against the three peptides coupled to RNAse A, and the results show that while there is cross-reactivity between the antibodies raised against peptide 1-15 and 1-27, no such cross reactivity is observed against peptide 33-42, demonstrating the specificity of the immune response. Likewise, The ELISA titers obtained, expressed as the dilution of the serum yielding an EUSA signal three standard deviations above background, were very high, and ranged from 60*000 to 600"000. No A peptide-specific antibodies were detected in the controls (pre-immune mice).<br>

The PCR product of the appropriate size was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification idt and digested with Xhol and Ncol according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (Gibco). The product was purified from an agarose gel with the Qiagen gel extraction kit. Plasmid VAE-pASKll6 was in parallel cleaved with Xhol and Ncol and a 3.7 kb band purified from agarose gels. Appropriate aliquots of the Xhol-Ncol digested PCR product and the plasmid were ligated overnight at 16°C using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer"s protocoll (Gibco). The ligation product was transfonned into competent E.coli XL-1 cells which were plated on agarose plates containing chloramphenicol. Single colonies were expanded in LB/chloramphenicol medium, plasmid was prepared (Qiagen mini plasmid kit) and tested for the presence of the tpropriate XhoI-NcoI insert size after digestion with the corresponding enzymes. A correspondingly positive plasmid termed pCA2 was sent for sequencing<br><br>
