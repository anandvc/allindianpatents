The base fluids in component c) in accordance with the invention utilize mineral oil based fluids (API Group I, II and III), lubricating oil base stock, poly-alpha-olefins - PAOs (API Group IV), esters (API Group V), other synthetic fluids, natural oils that are animal or vegeta-<br><br>
be in origin, and mixtures thereof. The base fluids are of suitable viscosity for utilization in engine oil applications.<br>
The compositions are useful in lubricating oils. The present lubricating oils are for example those employed in internal combustion engines. The present oils have necessary lubricating viscosity. The oils are for example mineral oils or are synthetic and mixtures thereof.<br>
The lubricating oil base stock can be derived from natural lubricating oils, synthetic lubricating oils or mixtures thereof. Suitable lubricating oil base stocks obtained by isomerization of synthetic wax and slack wax, as well as hydrocrackate base stocks produced by hydrocracking (rather than solvent extracting) the aromatic and polar components of the crude oil.<br>
Natural lubricating oils include animal oils, vegetable oils (for example, rapeseed oils, castor oils, and lard oil), petroleum oils, mineral oils, and oils derived from coal or shale.<br>
Synthetic oils include hydrocarbon oils and halo-substituted hydrocarbon oils, such as polymerised and inter-polymerised olefins, alkyl benzenes, polyphenols, alkylated diphenyl ethers, alkylated diphenyl sulphides, as well as their derivatives, analogues and homologues thereof, and the like. Synthetic lubricating oils also include alkylene oxide polymers, inter-polymers, copolymers and derivatives thereof wherein the terminal hydroxy groups have been modified by esterification, etherification, etc. Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils comprises the esters of dicarboxylic acids with a variety of alcohols. Esters useful as synthetic oils also include those made from C5 to C12 monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol ethers.<br>
Silicon-based oils, such as the polyalkyl-, polyaryl, polyalkoxy, or polyaryloxy-siloxane oils and silicate oils, comprise another useful class of synthetic lubricating oils. Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of phosphorus-containing acids, polymeric tetrahydrofu-rans, polyalphaolefins, and the like.<br>
The lubricating oil may be derived from unrefined, refined, rerefined oils, or mixtures thereof. Unrefined oils are obtained directly from a natural source or synthetic source (for example, coal, shale, or tar and bitumen) without further purification or treatment. Examples of unrefined oils include a shale oil obtained directly from a retorting operation, petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation, or an ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process, each of which is then used without further treatment. Refined oils are similar to unrefined oils except that refined oils have been treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Suitable purification techniques include distillation, hydro treating, dewax-ing, solvent extraction, acid or base extraction, filtration, and percolation, all of which are known to those skilled in the art. Rerefined oils are obtained by treating refined oils in proc-<br><br>
esses similar to those used to obtain refined oils. These rerefined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques for removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products.<br>
Lubricating oil base stocks derived from the hydroisomerization of wax may also be used, either alone or in combination with the aforesaid natural and/or synthetic base stocks. Such wax isomerised oil is produced by the hydroisomerization of natural or synthetic waxes or mixtures thereof over hydroisomerization catalyst.<br>
Examples of natural waxes are the slack waxes recovered by the solvent dewaxing of mineral oils; synthetic waxes are the wax produced by the Fischer-Tropsch process. The resulting isomerised product is subjected to solvent dewaxing and fractionation to recover various fractions of specific viscosity indices, generally having a VI of at least 130, preferably at least 135 and higher and following dewaxing, a pour point of about -20°C and lower.<br>
The production of wax isomerised oil meeting the requirements of the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification Nos. 4,049,299 and 4,158,671.<br>
Greases or other solid lubricants are also lubricating oils according to this invention.<br>
The synthetic hydrocarbon oils include long chain alkanes, such as cetanes and olefin polymers, such as trimer and tetramers of octane and decane. These synthetic oils can be mixed with 1) ester oils, such as pentaerythritol esters of monocarboxylic acids having about 2 to 20 carbon atoms, 2) polyglycol ethers, 3) polyacetals and 4) siloxane fluids. Useful among the synthetic esters are those made from polycarboxylic acids and monohydric alcohols. For example, ester fluids made from pentaerythritol or mixtures thereof with di- and tripentaerythri-tol, and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or mixtures of such acids. Other examples are ester fluids made from trimethylolpropane and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or mixtures of such acids.<br>
The present lubricating oils are also for example crude oil, industrial lubrication oils, cutting oil, metal working fluids and greases.<br>
Fuels are also a base fluid according to the invention, for example certain aviation fuels and the like, wherein lubrication properties are desired. The fuels are for example a hydrocarbo-naceous petroleum distillate, such as motor gasoline, diesel fuel or fuel oil. Liquid fuel compositions comprising non-hydrocarbonaceous materials, such as alcohols, ethers, organo-ni-tro compounds and the like (e.g. methanol, ethanol, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, nitro-methane) are also within the scope of this invention as are liquid fuels derived from vegetable or mineral sources, such as corn, alfalfa, shale and coal. Fuels that are mixtures of one or more hydrocarbonaceous fuels and one or more non-hydrocarbonaceous materials are<br><br>
also contemplated. Examples of such mixtures are combinations of gasoline and ethanol and of diesel fuel and ether.<br>
The present additives provide extreme pressure, antiwear and friction reducing properties to the oil, and upon combustion, are innocuous to conventional catalytic converters in automobiles.<br>
The percent by weight of component a) to the total weight of component a) plus component b) is for example from about 0.001 to about 99.999%. For instance the percent by weight of component a) to the total weight of a) plus b) is from about 0.05% to about 90.0%, from about 0.1% to about 50.0%, or from about 1.0% to about 10.0%.<br>
The additive mixture of this invention, the combination of component a) and component b), are present in the oil composition in a total amount of for example about 0.01% to about 20.0% by weight of the total composition. For instance, the antioxidant compositions are present from about 0.05% to about 15.0%, from about 0.1% to about 10.0%, from about 0.2% to about 5.0% by weight, based on the weight of the entire composition. For example, the antioxidant compositions are present from about 0.1% to about 20.0%, from about 0.1% to about 15.0% or from about 0.1% to about 5.0% by weight, based on the weight of the entire composition.<br>
In lubricating compositions operated under extremely adverse conditions, such as lubricating compositions for marine diesel engines, the additives of this invention may be present in amounts of up to about 30.0% by weight, or more, of the total weight of the lubricating composition.<br>
The additives of this invention are present in the fuel compositions at a level of from about 1 ppm to about 50 000 ppm based on the fuel. For example the additives are present from about 4 ppm to about 5 000 ppm based on the fuel by weight.<br>
Another object of the invention is the antioxidant mixture based on the combination of component a) and component b).<br>
Thus, also disclosed are antioxidant compositions, which comprise a mixture of<br>
a)	At least one hindered phenolic antioxidant compound of formula (I), wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and E are as defined above; and<br>
b)	At least one additional antioxidant compound.<br>
The present invention also relates to the above-defined composition additionally comprising<br><br>
e) At least one organic material subject to the deleterious effects of oxidative, thermal, or light-induced degradation.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to compositions comprising an organic material in component e) which is sensitive to oxidative, thermal, or light-induced degradation and at least one compounds listed in component a) formula (I) and at least one antioxidant compound listed in component b).<br>
The invention also relates to a process for stabilizing an organic material in component e) which is sensitive to oxidative, thermal, or light-induced degradation, which comprises adding, to this material, at least one compound listed in component a) formula (I) and at least one antioxidant compound listed in component b).<br>
Organic materials in component e), which would benefit from the incorporation of the antioxidants are polymers, for example synthetic polymers, in particular thermoplastic polymers. Particularly preferred organic materials in component e) are polyolefins and styrene copolymers, for example those mentioned in U.S. Patent Specification No. 5,478,875 under items 1 to 3 and items 6 and 7. Especially preferred organic materials in component e) are for example polyethylene, polypropylene, ABS, and styrene/butadiene copolymers. The invention therefore preferably relates to compositions in which the organic material in component e) is a synthetic organic polymer or a mixture of such polymers, in particular a polyolefin or a styrene copolymer.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of improving oxidative performance in a lubricating oil composition comprising<br>
b)	At least one antioxidant compound according to component b), as defined above; and<br>
c)	A base fluid,<br>
which method comprises incorporating into said lubricating oil composition at least one compound of component a) formula (I) as defined above.<br>
The lubricating oils stabilized in accordance with the invention may additionally or optionally include other additives, component d), which are added in order to improve still further the basic properties of these formulations; such additives include other antioxidants, metal pas-sivators, rust inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, viscosity index improvers, extreme pressure agents, pour point depressants, solid lubricants, dispersants, detergents, antifoams, colour stabilizers, further extreme pressure additives, demulsifiers, friction modifiers, and, antiwear additives. Such additives are added in the customary amounts in each case in the range<br><br>

sure is released and aluminum isopropoxide (174.0 g, 0.89 mol, Rhone Poulenc, MANALOX 130) is added portion wise. A reduced pressure is applied while heating to 130°C. After seven hours, the temperature is increased to 165°C for three hours. The excess isooctanol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The antioxidant composition is received (13,834 g) as a light amber oil and contains 89.0 wt% of isooctyl esters (as a mixture) by calibrated gas chromatography.<br>
Example 12: Antioxidant Compositions<br>
Methyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (100 kg), isooctanol (62.9 kg Exxal 8 from Exxon), and the composition according to Example 3 (30.7 kg) are added to a reactor and heated to 100°C under reduced pressure. The reduced pressure is released and aluminum isopropoxide (650.0 g, 3.3 mol, Rhone Poulenc, MANALOX 130) is added. A reduced pressure of 0.2 bar is applied while heating to 150°C. After two and one-half hours, the excess isooctanol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The antioxidant composition is received (356.9 lbs.) as a light amber oil and contains 85.9 wt% of isooctyl esters (as a mixture) by calibrated gas chromatography.<br>
Example 13: Antioxidant Compositions<br>
Methyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate, isooctanol, and the composition according to Example 3 are added to a reactor and heated to 100°C under reduced pressure. The reduced pressure is released and MANALOX 130 is added. A reduced pressure of 0.2 bar is applied while heating to 150°C. After two and one-half hours, the excess isooctanol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. Under these reaction conditions, dimethyl a-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)glutarate, diisooctyl a-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyben-zyl)glutarate, and monomethyl-monoisooctyl a-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)glutarate are produced.<br>
Example 14: Flash Point Test<br>
A flash point test is performed on the examples to ensure no volatile, flammable components are present. The samples are tested using an Erdco Rapid Tester Model RT-1 at 22.2°C, 60.6 C, and 92.8°C. The results are summarized below:<br><br><br>
The results indicate that the compositions do not contain volatile, flammable components.<br>
Example 15: TGA Analysis<br>
Athermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is performed with the composition according to some representative Examples to evaluate their volatility at elevated temperatures. The weight loss of samples as temperature is increased is monitored and the temperatures at which a 10% and 50% weight loss occur are noted. The results are summarized below:<br><br>
The data show that the compositions are less volatile than the compound according to Example 1, a compound known in the prior art.<br>
Example 16: High Temperature Deposit Test<br>
The compositions are evaluated for their ability to reduce deposit formation in lubricants, such as passenger car motor oil and diesel engine oil formulations. Thin films of oil on steel cups are heated at 230°C in the Alcor Micro Carbon Residue Tester for increasing periods of time. After each time interval the cups are washed with hexane and the amount of residue left behind is determined. The difference in percent deposits formed by a base formulation for a set time interval is compared with those formed by the base formulation plus stabilizers. The magnitude of a beneficial decrease in deposit formation is rated as a ratio that is designated the performance index (PI). The higher the PI, the better the sample is at controlling deposit formation. Each formulation contains 1.5% by weight of stabilizer in a fully<br><br>
formulated SAE 5W-30 passenger car motor oil, GF-4 type formulation with 0.05 % phosphorus by weight.<br><br>
Example 17: Hot Tube Test<br>
The compositions are evaluated in a test that measures the deposit forming tendencies of an oil sample. In the test, oil droplets are pushed upward by compressed air inside a glass capillary tube that is heated to 248°C. Test oil percolates upward through the tube for 16 hours forming a lacquer on the inner wall of the tube. At the conclusion of the test, the tube is washed, dried and rated for cleanliness on a 0-10 scale (0: dirty, 10: clean).<br>
Each formulation contains 1.5% by weight of stabilizer in a fully formulated SAE 5W-30 passenger car motor oil, GF-4 type formulation with 0.05 % phosphorus by weight. The data are summarized below and represent the average of two tests.<br><br>
Example 18: HPDSC Test<br>
High pressure differential scanning calorimetry (HPDSC) is an analytical technique that evaluates oxidative performance of additives in various substrates. ATA Instruments Model 2920 is used for the evaluations. The test is run under pressure to prevent volatilization of the material to be evaluated. In this evaluation, the samples, in aluminum pans, are heated<br><br>
isothermally at 210°C in a cell pressurized to 0.519 bar with air. The time until an exothermic reaction occurs (oxidation induction time) is measured. The longer the oxidation induction period, the more stable the sample.<br>
Each formulation contains 1.5% by weight of stabilizer in a fully formulated SAE 5W-30 passenger car motor oil, GF-4 type formulation with 0.05 % phosphorus by weight. The data are summarized below and represent the average of two tests.<br><br><br>
