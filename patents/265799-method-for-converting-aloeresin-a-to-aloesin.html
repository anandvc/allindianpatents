				<td>METHOD FOR CONVERTING ALOERESIN A TO ALOESIN<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Invention relates to a method for converting aloeresin A to aloesin.<br>
Aloe is a succulent plant of which more than 300 species are known to exist, most of which are indigenous to Africa. Products from the aloe have been used in traditional medicine for centuries and in particular have been used in dermatological applications for the treatment of burns, sores and other wounds. Modern therapeutic observations include anti-inflammatory activity, anti-tumor activity, anti-acid activity, anti-diabetic activity, tyrosinase inhibiting activity and ahtioxidant activity. Aloe products are also used extensively in the cosmetic and health food industries, especially with the recent increase in popularity of natural products,<br>
The main species of African aloe from which pharmaceutical, therapeutic, dermatological or cosmetic applications are obtained is Aloe ferox, a species restricted to Southern Africa. Other species of aloe are also used for similar purposes. Aloe vera is used extensively in the USA in skin care products, shampoos and health drinks. A. ferox has, however, been found to have several superior properties to A. vera. For example, A. ferox has a higher calcium and total amino acid content than A. vera. The cut leaf of cultivated A. ferox plants also produces approximately 20 times more bitter sap, weight for weight, than an A. vera plant growing beside It. Since A.ferox leaves are much thicker and wider, the total yield of bitter sap per leaf is even greater. The amount of gel recovered from A. ferox is also consistently greater in volume than that obtained from A. vera.<br>
Many methods exist for the isolation of particular components of the aloe (see, for example, US Patents 4,735,935 and 4,656,029). One of the commercial products of the aloe is obtained from the sap produced by the leaf of the aloe and is called aloe bitters due to Its bitter taste. The sap Is collected and dried by traditional methods<br>
which will be known to persons skilled in the art to produce a dark brown solid substance known as aloe bitters or Cape Aloes.<br>
Commercial aloe bitters contains four major constituents, i.e. aloin A, aloin B, aloesin and aloeresin A.<br>
The overall composition of major compounds in A. ferox leaf exudate is remarkably invariable, especially when the morphological variation and wide natural distribution area of this species are considered. In A, ferox, aloeresin A, aloesin and aloin (both epimers A and B) contribute between 70% and 97% of total dry weight, in a ratio of approximately 4:3:2 respectively.<br>
Aloin A and B (or barbaloin) are isolated from aloe bitters, normally by selective extraction, and are principally used as a purgative. Aloesin is also isolated from aloe bitters and Is used as a skin lightening and sunscreen agent (US Patent 4,656,029). The aloeresin A is usually discarded. Thus, although aloeresin A is present in the largest quantity in the aloe sap, it has little or no commercial value. It would therefore be advantageous to convert the aloeresin A into a compound which has a higher commercial value.<br>
In the description which follows, any reference to aloe sap is also intended to refer to aloe bitters or an extract of aloe bitters.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention there is provided a method for converting aloeresin A to aloesin, the method including the step of hydrolysing at least a portion of the aloeresin A to aloesin and p-coumaric acid.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process for hydrolytically converting aloeresin A to aloesin is described herein.<br>
Aloeresin A is an aloesinyl ester of p-coumaric acid, and the applicant has found that it is possible to efficiently and economically hydrolyse aloeresin A to aloesin (a C-glycoside-5-methylchromone), thereby increasing the amount of aloesin available for extraction from sap of aloe plants. As aloesin is more commercially valuable than aloeresin A, the process also increases the commercial value of the sap or aloe bitters from the aloe plant. The conversion reaction of aloeresin A to aloesin is depicted below: <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 The conversion of aloeresin A to aloesin also facilitates the selective removal of thealoesin, as well as byproducts aloin A and B from the aloe bitters. The extraction and purification of aloesin in the absence of aloeresin A Is much less difficult and costly than in the presence of aloresin A, for two main reasons:<br>
(a) after conversion, there is more aloesin that can be extracted; and<br>
 (b) after conversion, only two main components (aloesin and aloin) need to be separated from the aloe bitters, and as these have very different physical properties, selective extraction of aloesin becomes much easier.<br>
The process may also include the step of separating the aloesin from the p-coumaric acid. Suitable separation steps will be apparent to persons skilled in the art and will not be discussed in detail herein, although typical separation processes include solvent extraction, chromatography and crystallisation.<br>
Examples of hydrolysis steps that can be used in the process are acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis.<br>
In the case of acid hydrolysis, the acid can be any organic or inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and so forth.<br>
In the case of enzymatic hydrolysis, the hydrolytic enzyme can be an esterase, a lipase or a protease, such as Aspergillus oryzae protease, ESL 001-02™ from Diversa, NOVO 388™ from Nordisk (particularly the protease contaminant in the preparation), or Mucormiehei lipase from the Altus Chiroscreen Kit™. More particularly, the enzyme is either Protease M™ from Amano or Bioprotease P cone™ from Quest International, both being the protease from AspergHlus oryzae. Alternatively, the enzyme could be an enzyme which is encoded by a DNA or amino acid sequence which at least substantially corresponds to the DNA or amino acid sequence of any one of the enzymes mentioned above or partial sequences thereof. The DNA or amino acid sequence of the enzyme could have at least 70% homology with the DNA or amino acid sequence of the above enzymes. The enzyme is In either solid or liquid form.<br>
The aloeresin A is typically converted to aloesin and p-coumaric acid without the formation of by-products, such as polymers.<br>
Any species of the aloe plant is suitable as a source of aloeresin A, which is obtainable from sap produced by leaves of the aloe plant, the sap may be in liquid or solid form, and the aloeresin A can be in purified form, in partially purified form or may be in unpurified form within the sap or another part of the aloe plant.<br>
The hydrolysis step, when using an acid, is generally carried out in an acid concentration range of from about 0.5 N to about 10 N, and is optimally carried out at a concentration of from about 2 to about 5 N acid. An organic solvent, such as ethanol or acetone in concentrations of from about 10 to 50% and preferably at about 30%, may optionally be added to the reaction process.<br>
The hydrolysis step is generally carried out at from about 20 to about 121°C, and when using an acid, is typically carried out at about 90°C. When using a hydrolytic enzyme, the hydrolysis step is typically carried out at about 37°C, except when using enzyme ESL001-02, in which case the hydrolysis step is carried out at from about 50 to about 90°C, and more particularly at about 70°C.<br>
A buffer can be used in the reaction medium. The buffer may be a sodium phosphate, carbonate or borate buffer or water, or any other buffer having a pKa in the pH range of from about 4 to about 8. The buffer concentration may be in the range of from about 0.01 M to about 1 M, and is preferably 0.1 M.<br>
The aloesin obtained by the hydrolysis process described above may be used in topical skin compositions. The aloin may be used in various compositions for the human and veterinary markets.<br>
Examples:<br>
In the examples, hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid were used to demonstrate the ability of acids to hydrolyse aloeresin A to aloesin, and Aspergillus oryzae protease was used to demonstrate enzymatic hydrolysis of aloeresin A to aloesin.<br>
A quantitative HPLC method was developed as an analytical tool to monitor the amount of aloeresin A, aloesin and p-coumaric acid during optimisation of the hydrolysis process described herein. Details of the tests and results are set out in the examples below.<br>
Example 1:     Acid hydrolysis using HCI and acetone<br>
Aloe sap containing aloeresln A (15%) was hydrolysed at 90°C with 1.3 or 5 N HCI in the presence or absence of acetone over time. The acetone was used to increase the solubility of substrate in the aloe sap. Aliquots (20 ul) of the reaction were taken at timed intervals, and were added to 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 30% acetone. Analysis of samples was performed by HPLC, using established methods.<br>
Results showed that the rate of hydrolysis was dependent on acid strength, and that between 40% and 80% conversion was achieved when 5 N HCI was used. The presence of 10% acetone improved hydrolysis slightly. The rate of aloeresin A disappearance was greater at higher acid strength. The results also showed that 90-95% aloeresin A had disappeared within 2 h at 3 to 5 N HCI.<br>
Example 2:     Acid hydrolysis using HCI or HgSC and ethanol<br>
Ethanol was used as an alternative to acetone. Aloe extract containing aloeresin A was hydrolysed at 90°C with 1 N HCI or H2SO4 in the presence of 50% (v/v) ethanol over the times shown. The amount of aloe extract was varied from 10 to 50% (v/v). Aliquots (1 ml) of each reaction were taken at the indicated time intervals, and were added to 0.5 ml cold acetone. Analysis of samples was performed by HPLC, using established methods.<br>
Mole balance closures between aloeresin A and aloesin were in the region of 80% after 4 h reaction (and were possibly higher within this period), using H2S04 as the hydrolysing acid and an aloe sap concentration of 30%. Mole balance closures were about 10% higher when H2SO4 was used as the acid, but losses in mole balances were observed sooner compared to HCI.<br>
Example 3:     Enzymatic hydrolysis using Aspemlllus orvzae protease<br>
Variable conditions were tested so as to preliminary optimise the enzymatic hydrolysis of aloeresin A to aloesin in an aloe extract or pure aloeresin A. Aspergillus oryzae protease was selected as an example of a hydrolytic enzyme, and two Aspergillus<br>
oryzae proteases were tested, the one being Protease M™ from Amano and the other being Bioprotease P cone™ from Quest International.<br>
Protease M™ specifications:<br>
Origin: Asp. oryzae (Non-GMO) Diluent: Potato Dextrin (Non-GMO) Contents of diluent: Approx. 15%<br>
Bioprotease P cone™ specifications:<br>
minimum 400,000 HUT Protease u/gm<br>
-	Total Viable Count 
-	Yeast &amp; Moulds 
-	E. coli: Absent in 25 gms<br>
-	Salmonella: Absent in 25 gms<br>
-	Meets all other international specifications<br>
(heavy metals, lead, arsenic, etc.) as set out by FCC &amp; JECFA.<br>
The following parameters were investigated on a small scale:<br>
Enzyme concentration:	1 to 50 mgl enzyme<br>
Aloe extract:	15 nl to 200 |jJ per 3 ml<br>
Buffer types:	Sodium phosphate, borate, or carbonate<br>
Buffer concentrations:	0.001 M to 1 M<br>
pH:	4 to 7<br>
Tween concentrations:	0,1 and 10% v/v<br>
Acetone concentration:	0 to 50%<br>
Typically at least 50% increase in aloesin concentration was obtained when using aloe sap as substrate.<br>
Example 4:     Enzymatic hydrolysis using Aspemillus oryzae protease<br>
Reactions were carried out on 3 mg pure (91%) aloeresin A per 1 ml reaction using Amano Protease M™ or Quest Bioprotease P cone™ as enzyme. The parameters investigated were:<br>
Enzyme concentration:         2 and 20 mg<br>
Buffer concentration:	0.01 M sodium phosphate<br>
pH:	5.5<br>
Reactions were carried out at 37°C with agitation on a vibrating agitator, over 20 h. Complete conversion of aloeresin A to aloesin was accomplished.<br>
For all the reactions, the whole reaction of 3ml was submitted for analysis. The samples were made up to 25 ml with water:methanol:THF (20:40:40) and analysed on HPLC.<br>
It was determined that the Aspergillus oryzae protease functions optimally at 37°C. The enzyme conversion of aloeresin A to aloesin and p-coumaric acid was optimised using the parameters described above, and conditions were found where aloeresin A is fully converted to aloesin and p-coumaric acid. After 4 h there was a 100% increase in the aloesin content and a 100% decrease in aloeresin A. The conversion was therefore complete with a mole balance of close to 100% when using pure aloeresin A as substrate.<br>
Example 5: Large scale production of aloesin<br>
The reactions were carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, glass-lined reactor. Aloe sap was hydrolysed using an equivalent mass of a 2 molar HCI solution under nitrogen. The reactor was heated to 90°C and the temperature maintained for approximately 5.5 hours. The conversion of aloeresin obtained was ca. 94%, with an average selectivity to aloesin of ca. 30%.<br>
At the end of the reaction, the reactor content was cooled to 70°C by passing chilled water through the jacket. The system was neutralised using a 45% caustic solution (ca. 0.75 equivalents to the acid) to a pH of ca. 4.5.<br>
The reactor was further cooled to 28°C, and the agitation stopped. The reaction mixture is allowed to separate into 2 phases. The aqueous phase (referred to as<br>
hydrolysate) settled to .the bottom and top layer containing solids settled on top (referred to as the'top layer). The hydrolysate was drained to a holding tank.<br>
The top layer was aerated with nitrogen together with agitation prior to the addition of water. The reactor contents were then washed with an equivalent mass of water. The reactor was stirred at 25°C for 30 minutes and then allowed to stand for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
The separation of the mixture was carried out at 25°C, with the top layer remaining at the top. The aqueous phase was drained to the holding tank. The water wash was combined with the hydrolysate drained earlier. The total aloesin recovered from the post reaction stream was ca. 84%.<br>
The remaining solids were removed from the reactor by dissolution in a 10% caustic solution. The wash solution is then drained and treated as waste.<br>
The invention is not intended to be limited to the precise details as herein described. For example, the applicant envisages that other hydrolytic agents could also be used In the hydrolysis reaction, such as acids and enzymes which are chemical or biochemical equivalents of the tested acids or enzymes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
