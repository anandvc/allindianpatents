The invention relates to a method to produce moulds or cores, in particular for foundry<br>
purposes, from a mixture of sand or moulding material and a binder, which is particularly<br>
water soluble and/or hydroscopic, with the mixture being shot in a shooting process into a<br>
molding or core tool by at least one shooting unit through at least one discharge opening<br>
arranged at a shooting plate and subsequently hardened, and with the area of the<br>
discharge opening being moistened and/or kept moist at least via a liquid or water<br>
between two shooting processes.<br>
The invention further relates to a device to produce moulds or cores, in particular for<br>
foundry purposes, made from a mixture of sand or a moulding material and a preferably<br>
inorganic binder, which is preferably water soluble and/or hydroscopic, having at least<br>
one discharge opening and a shooting unit provided with a shooting head, with a shooting<br>
plate with at least one discharge opening being provided at the shooting head and a<br>
device its fastened to, particularly to perform the above-mentioned method.<br>
A method and a similar device are known from DE 103 40 491 B3. Here, a method is<br>
provided for carrying this out such that the moisture is fed in form of a finely distributed<br>
and/or sprayed or atomized liquid. However, it has shown that here too much liquid can<br>
enter the area of the shooting openings or discharge openings and can dissolve the binder<br>
out of the mixture of sand or binder or wash it out and/or can render the mixture of sand<br>
and binder, which is located in and/or slightly above the shooting openings or discharge<br>
openings, too moist so that within the moulding or core tool differently moist mixture<br>
areas of sand or molding material and binder can be present, leading to irregularities of<br>
the mould or the core.<br>
From DE 101 44 193 C1 it is known to make a moisture carrier contact the filling<br>
elements to create a moist atmosphere during the injection molding, which for example<br><br>
may be an absorbent material saturated with a liquid or water. Thereby the shooting<br>
opening and the mixture of sand and binder also becomes too wet, which can lead to<br>
irregularities in the mixture.<br>
Further, DE 101 44 193 C1 discloses that the moisture supplied shall act as a condensate,<br>
which in turn in the area of the shooting opening or discharge opening of a filling element<br>
can largely lead to a dilution of the mixture of sand and binder with the above-mentioned<br>
disadvantages.<br>
Therefore the object is to provide a method and a device of the type mentioned at the<br>
outset, by which a premature hardening of the mixture of core sand or molding material<br>
and binder is avoided in the area of the shooting opening or discharge opening and thus a<br>
low maintenance, constant operation is enabled without the binder becoming too moist or<br>
even being washed out.<br>
In order to attain this object, the method defined at the outset provides that the liquid<br>
serving to moisten or the water serving to moisten the mixture is atomized into a<br>
suspendable aerosol by way of ultrasound and fed to the area of the shooting opening<br>
and/or the shooting unit or the shooting head.<br>
It has shown that by using ultrasound, a liquid, for example an aqueous liquid or water,<br>
can be transferred into a suspendable aerosol, with its liquid components being so small<br>
that they change into humidity without condensing and without precipitating as a<br>
condensate in the area of the shooting opening for the sand-binder mixture. The size of<br>
the liquid particles created by ultrasound may amount to a size of 0.01 millimeter or less.<br>
Simultaneously sufficiently high humidity is achieved, preventing the dehydration of the<br>
sand-binder mixture between two shooting processes, for example, so that the individual<br>
shots can occur in a secure process without unevenly moist areas developing in the mould<br>
or the core.<br><br>
The aerosol and /or the amount of said suspendable aerosol and the volume of the flow<br>
provided with said aerosol can be adjusted by changing the pulse packages emitted by the<br>
ultrasound generator(s) and/or by changing the voltage of the ultrasound generator(s). In<br>
this way, the amount of the suspendable aerosol, by which the area of the shooting<br>
opening(s) is moistened, can be adjusted to the environmental conditions, such as<br>
atmospheric humidity, number of shooting openings, and ambient temperature.<br>
A particularly beneficial embodiment of the method according to the invention may<br>
comprise that the suspendable aerosol is formed at a distance from the shooting<br>
opening(s) and is supplied via a line to the shooting opening(s). In this way, the area of<br>
the shooting unit requires no space for creating said aerosol. However, in the area of the<br>
shooting openings, a sufficient amount of humidity must be provided so that any closure<br>
of the shooting openings by dehydration is avoided without supplying too much moisture,<br>
which particularly could wash out or dissolve the binder, perhaps.<br>
Another particularly advantageous embodiment of the method according to the invention<br>
may comprise that the sand supply in the shooting tube and/or in the shooting head is<br>
moistened with a liquid aerosol. The shooting tube and/or the shooting head can<br>
therefore be connected to an ultrasound atomizer for liquids or water via one or more<br>
tubes, so that also the sand supply and particularly its surface being moistened, which<br>
otherwise could form a crust without becoming saturated, which can occur in addition to<br>
directly moistening the shooting opening or instead thereof indirectly moistening the<br>
shooting opening.<br>
In order to attain the object, the device defined at the outset is characterized in that it is<br>
provided with at least one ultrasound atomizer for water or for a liquid, particularly<br>
comprising water, and that the ultrasound atomizer is connected to the discharge<br>
opening(s). The invention therefore uses the fact or teaching that ultrasound generators<br>
can vaporize water or a water-comprising liquid such that the individual droplets are<br>
smaller than one 20-thousandths of a millimeter or even smaller than 10-thousandths of a<br><br>
millimeter, so that they transfer into humidity and do not precipitate as a liquid film on<br>
parts of the shooting unit and particularly in the area of the shooting opening.<br>
Here, it is particularly useful when the ultrasound generator(s) and the liquid reservoir<br>
allocated thereto are arranged spatially separated from the shooting unit and are<br>
connected to the area of the shooing opening(s) via at least one tubular or hose<br>
connection. Experiments have shown that the suspended aerosol formed by an<br>
ultrasound atomizer from water or a water containing liquid can be transported without<br>
any problems over several meters through such a line in order to then provide sufficiently<br>
moist air to the shooting opening(s), preventing the dehydration of the mixture of sand or<br>
moulding material and binder, in particular in the shooting openings, without the mixture<br>
becoming saturated to an excessive extent. In this way, advantageously the liquid<br>
reservoir with the ultrasound generator can be arranged at a location of the moulding or<br>
core shooting machine and/or near said machine at a location having sufficient space.<br>
In order to transport the aerosol from the ultrasound atomizer(s) to the shooting<br>
opening(s) of the shooting unit, a fan and/or a pressure connection can be arranged,<br>
particularly above the surface of the liquid of the liquid reservoir. Although, based on its<br>
inert pressure, the aerosol could flow to the shooting openings, primarily in relatively<br>
short tubes, a fan or a pressurized gas connection can improve this flow and/or allow a<br>
greater distance of said ultrasound generator from the shooting openings. Further, by<br>
using a fan and/or a pressurized gas connection, differences in height between the<br>
ultrasound atomizer and the shooting plate and/or another target of the aerosol at the core<br>
shooting machine can be overcome. Primarily, the aerosol can also be transported<br>
upwards, so that the ultrasound generator with the liquid reservoir can be arranged lower,<br>
where generally sufficient place is available for it. Here, it is advantageous that a<br>
potentially occurring condensate at the interior walls of the tube or hose, in which the<br>
aerosol is transported, can reflux into the reservoir.<br>
Therefore it is particularly beneficial when the liquid reservoir is a closed liquid vessel<br>
and is subject to a pressure based on a fan and/or a pressure connection arranged in or at<br><br>
its walls or effective there. Accordingly, the aerosol created by an ultrasound atomizer<br>
can be transported to its target location in a continuous fashion.<br>
Here, it is particularly advantageous when one or more, for example two, ultrasound<br>
atomizers, are provided at the liquid reservoir. The surface of the liquid reservoir and the<br>
liquid contained therein can therefore be appropriately large and create an accordingly<br>
large amount of aerosol so that correspondingly large shooting units can be kept moist<br>
simultaneously even at several sites.<br>
A mobile protective device with a rinsing hood may be allocated to the shooting head,<br>
provided with the connection for the aerosol and being removable or separable for the<br>
individual shots, and the connection line from the ultrasound atomizer and the liquid<br>
reservoir to the protective device can be embodied as a telescopic tube or a hose. This<br>
way, the possibility remains to provide a mobile protective device and rinsing hood,<br>
because it can be connected via mobile lines following the motions of the protective<br>
device.	<br>
It can be advantageous for the shooting tube and/or the shooting head of the shooting unit<br>
to be connected to the ultrasound atomizer and the liquid reservoir via one or more lines.<br>
In this way, a crust formation at the surface of the sand supply, particularly in the<br>
shooting tube, can be avoided. Further, in this way the sand supply can be moistened in a<br>
targeted fashion such that at the discharge opening or shooting opening only a slight<br>
feeding or perhaps none at all of the moisture is necessary, but rather the moisture is fed<br>
to the area of the shooting opening via the sand supply. Therefore, a direct or an indirect<br>
feeding of aerosol to the shooting opening(s) can be provided, with a combination of both<br>
promising the best results.<br>
In the following, an exemplary embodiment of the invention is described in greater detail<br>
using the drawing. The sole Figure shows:<br><br>
in a schematic representation, a longitudinal cross-sectional view through a shooting unit<br>
to feed a mixture of sand or moulding material and a binder to a core tool, also shown<br>
schematically in a vertical cross-section, with one line each opening in a protective<br>
device with a-gas rinsing hood allocated to a shooting unit, on the one hand, and a<br>
shooting tube allocated to the shooting unit, on the other side, originating at a liquid<br>
reservoir with an ultrasound atomizer and serving to moisten the shooting opening and<br>
the sand supply.<br>
A device to produce moulds and cores, indicated as 1 in its entirety, which in the<br>
exemplary embodiment is used to produce cores for foundry purposes, from a mixture M<br>
comprising sand or a moulding material and a particularly water-soluble or hydroscopic<br>
binder, is provided with a shooting unit, indicated as 2 in its entirety, essentially<br>
comprising a shooting tube 3 that accepts the mixture M and a shooting head 4.<br>
At the bottom end of the shooting head 4, a shooting plate 5 is arranged, above which the<br>
mixture M is located, which can be shot in a shooting process through at least one<br>
shooting nozzle 6 with a shooting opening 7 as well as, in the exemplary embodiment,<br>
another shooting opening 7 out of the shooting unit 2 into a core tool 8. For this purpose,<br>
in a manner known per se, the shooting tube 3 is impinged with pressure from above such<br>
that the mixture M is driven through the shooting nozzle 6, fitting into the input opening<br>
9 of the core tool 8, out of the space located above the shooting plate 5 and is enclosed in<br>
the space 14 in the core tool 8 provided to accept the mixture and fills it.<br>
In the drawing, the device 1 is shown in a state after a shooting process, i. e. the shooting<br>
unit 2 and the core tool 8 are separated and at a distance from each other.<br>
In order to prevent remnants of the mixture left in the shooting nozzle 6 and/or the<br>
shooting opening 7 and the mixture M located above the shooting plate 5 from crusting<br>
in the time until the next shot and primarily from plugging up the discharge openings 7<br>
by the partially hardened mixture, they are moistened in the following manner.<br><br>
Between the shooting unit 2 and the core tool 8, a mobile protective unit 10 with a gas<br>
rinsing hood 11 is provided. The protective device 10 is provided with a hollow space<br>
12. When the device is connected to the shooting plate 5 in the manner shown it overlaps<br>
the plate and particularly the shooting openings 7 and also the shooting nozzle 6<br>
projecting into the hollow space 12. Here, the hollow space 12 is sealed from the<br>
shooting plate 5 in an air-tight or almost air-tight manner from the environment.<br>
Further, in the Figure a reservoir 13 is discernible for liquids 15 and two ultrasound<br>
atomizers 16, shown schematically and acting on the liquid 15, connected to the liquid<br>
reservoir 13. In this way, the liquid 15 comprising or containing water is transformed<br>
into a suspended aerosol, which is indicated as a "mushroom cloud" 17 above the surface<br>
of the liquid 15.<br>
The ultrasound atomizer 16 and the liquid reservoir 13 are connected to the hollow space<br>
12 of the protective device 10 via a tube 18 and thus to the shooting openings 7 such that<br>
they are moistened by the suspended aerosol but are not saturated by precipitating water.<br>
Here, it is discernible that the ultrasound atomizer 16 and the liquid reservoir 13 are<br>
arranged spatially separated from the shooting unit 2 and are connected to the area of the<br>
shooting openings 7 via a tubular or hose line 18. In this way, the creation of a<br>
suspended aerosol 17 can occur at a location offering sufficient space for this purpose.<br>
In order to transport the aerosol 17 from the ultrasound atomizers 16 and the liquid<br>
reservoir 13 to the shooting openings 7 of the shooting unit 2, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment a fan 19 and a pressure connection 20 are indicated, with both possibilities<br>
may be provided alternatively or simultaneously. Here, the fan 19 and/or the pressure<br>
connector 20 are located above the surface of the liquid 15 in the liquid reservoir 13,<br>
which is embodied as a closed liquid vessel, so that above the liquid 15 a pressure can be<br>
created by the fan 19 or the pressurized gas connection 20, serving to transport the<br>
aerosol 17. The pressurized gas connection 20 or the fan 19 are here arranged at or in a<br>
wall 21 of the liquid reservoir 13, which is embodied as a liquid vessel.<br><br>
Here, it is discernible in the exemplary embodiment that two ultrasound atomizers 16 are<br>
provided at the liquid reservoir 13, which are covered by the liquid 15 and thus can create<br>
two"aerosol clouds" 17, both of which can be transported in the line 18 in the direction<br>
of the arrow Pf.<br>
Due to the fact that the protective device 10 with the gas rinsing hood 11 is mobile in<br>
reference to the shooting unit 2 and the shooting plate 5, the line 18 leading thereto is<br>
embodied as a hose, capable of following the respective motions. In this way, the<br>
protection device 10 with the rinsing hood 11 allocated to the shooting head 4 and the<br>
shooting plate 5 can be removed and transported away from the shooting plate 5 for the<br>
individual shots, in spite of the connection for the aerosol and in spite of the line 18<br>
leading to this connection.<br>
Here, it is discernible in the drawing that the line 18 has a fork 22 and another line 23<br>
leading to and into the shooting tube 3 so that the aerosol formed by the ultrasound<br>
atomizer 16 can also be transported in or via the mixture M in order to prevent the<br>
surface of the mixture from crusting in this reservoir. Furthermore, in this way the entire<br>
mixture can be kept moist right from the start, which also prevents crusting in the<br>
shooting openings 7.<br>
Using the device 1 according to the invention it is also possible to atomize the liquid 15<br>
serving to moisten, for example water, into a suspendable aerosol via ultrasound and<br>
directly or indirectly feed it to the area of the shooting opening 7 or the shooting openings<br>
7. The direct feeding occurs in the exemplary embodiment via the line 18 and the<br>
protection device 10 with its hollow space 12 and the indirect supply occurs via the line<br>
23 and the shooting tube 3.<br>
In a manner not described in greater detail, the aerosol and the volume of the flow<br>
provided with the aerosol can be adjusted by changing the pulse packages emitted by the<br>
ultrasound generators 16 and/or by changing the voltage of the ultrasound generator 16.<br><br>
Due to the fact that the shooting unit 2 is connected to the liquid reservoir 13 and the<br>
ultrasound atomizer 16 via the hose 18 and the line 23, the suspendable aerosol is formed<br>
at a distance from the shooting openings 7 and guided thereto via the lines mentioned.<br>
Here, the aerosol 17 created by ultrasound results in such small liquid particles that they<br>
transfer into humidity, and thus can serve to moisten the mixture M at least in the area of<br>
the shooting openings 7, without precipitating as wetness and potentially even saturating<br>
the mixture M in an uneven manner and thus potentially rinsing out or dissolving the<br>
binders.<br>
In order to produce moulds or cores for foundry purposes from a mixture M from a<br>
moulding material or sand and a binder, a mixture M is shot out of at least one shooting<br>
unit 2 and/or out of a shooting pipe 3 and a shooting head 4 through at least one shooting<br>
opening 7 arranged at a shooting plate 5 into a moulding or core tool 8, with at least between two shooting processes, the area of the shooting opening 7 is moistened and/or<br>
kept moist by a liquid, and the liquid 15 that is used for moistening is atomized by at least<br>
one ultrasound mister 16 into a suspendable aerosol and directly or indirectly fed to the<br>
shooting opening 7, for example via the line 18 and/or 23.<br><br>

METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PRODUCING MOULDS OR CORES, IN<br>
PARTICULAR FOR FOUNDRY PURPOSES<br>
A method and device for producing moulds or cores, particularly for foundry<br>
purposes, are disclosed. To produce moulds or cores for foundry purposes from a mixture<br>
(M) of moulding material or sand and a binder, the mixture (M) is shot using a shooting<br>
unit (2) or from a shooting tube (3) and a shooting head (4) through at least one discharge<br>
opening (7) arranged on a shooting plate (5) into a moulding or core tool (8). The region<br>
