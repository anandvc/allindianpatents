and their agriculturally useful salts.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes and intermediates for preparing compounds of the formula I, to compositions comprising them and to the use of these derivatives or of the compositions comprising them for controlling harmful plants.<br>
Pyrazol-4-ylbenzoyl derivatives have been disclosed in the literature, for example in WO 96/26206.<br>
However, the herbicidal properties of the prior-art compounds and their compatibility with crop plants are not entirely satisfactory. It is an object of the present invention to provide novel, in particular herbicidally active, compounds which have improved properties.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the<br>
3— (4,5-dihydroisoxazol—5—yl)benzoylpyrazoles of the formula I and<br>
by their herbicidal activity.<br>
We have furthermore found herbicidal compositions which comprise the compounds I and which have very good herbicidal activity. Moreover, we have found processes for preparing these compositions and methods for controlling undesirable vegetation using the compounds- I.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the compounds of the formula I can contain one or more chiral centers, in which case they can exist as enantiomer or diastereomer mixtures. The present invention relates both to the pure enantiomers or diastereomers and to the mixtures thereof.<br>
The compounds of the formula I may also exist in the form of their agriculturally useful salts, the type of salt generally being of no importance. In general, suitable salts are the salts of those cations or the acid addition salts of those acids whose cations, or anions, respectively, do not adversely affect the herbicidal activity of the compounds I.<br>
Suitable cations are, in particular, ions of the alkali metals, preferably lithium, sodium and potassium, of the alkaline earth metals, preferably calcium and magnesium, and of the transition<br><br>
metals, preferably manganese, copper, zinc and iron, and also ammonium, it being possible in this case, if desired, for one to four hydrogen atoms to be replaced by Cj-C(—alkyl or hydroxy-Ci-C^-alkyl and/or a phenyl or benzyl, preferably ammonium, diisopropylammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, trimethylbenzylammonium, furthermore phosphonium ions, sulfonium ions, preferably tri{Ci—C4—alkyljsulfonium, and sulfoxonium ions, preferably tri (C1-C4—alkyl) sulfoxonium.<br>
Anions of useful acid addition salts are primarily chloride, bromide, fluoride, hydrogen sulfate, sulfate, dihydrogen phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, nitrate, hydrogen carbonate, carbonate, hexafluorosilicate, hexafluorophosphate, benzoate and the anions of C1-C4—alkanoic acids, preferably formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate.<br>
The organic moieties mentioned for the substituents R1—R1^ or as radicals on phenyl rings are collective terms for individual enumerations of the individual group members. All hydrocarbon chains, i.e. all alkyl, haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkylthio, alkylsulfinyl, haloalkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, haloalkylsulfonyl, alkylcarbonyl, haloalkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, haloalkoxycarbonyl, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkoxyalkyl, dialkoxymethyl, dialkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoiminoalkyl, hydroxyiminoalkyl, alkoxyiminoalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl and alkoxyalkoxy moieties may be straight-chain or branched.

The 3—
Process As<br>
Reaction of pyrazoles of the formula II (where Z = H) with an activated benzoic aC1d Ilia or a benzoic aC1d Hip, which is preferably activated in situ, to give the acylation product, followed by rearrangement.<br><br><br><br>
L1 is a nucleophilically displaceable leaving group, such as halogen, for example bromine, chlorine, hetaryl, for example imidazolyl, pyridyl, carboxylate, for example acetate, trifluoroacetate, etc.<br>
The activated benzoic aC1d can be employed directly, as in the case of the benzoyl halides, or be generated in situ, for example using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,<br>
triphenylphosphane/azodicarboxylic aC1d esters, 2—pyridine disulfide/triphenylphosphane, carbonyldiimidazole, etc.<br>
If appropriate, it may be advantageous to carry out the acylation reaction in the presence of a base. The reactants and the auxiliary base are advantageously employed in equimolar amounts. A slight excess of auxiliary base, for example from 1.2 to 1*5 molar equivalents, based on II, may be advantageous in some cases.<br>
Suitable auxiliary bases are tertiary alkylamines, pyridine or alkali metal carbonates. Suitable solvents are, for example, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, 1,2—dichloroethane, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, ethers, such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or esters, such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
if the activated carboxylic aC1d component used is a benzoyl halide, it may be advantageous to cool the reaction mixture to 0 — 10°C when adding this reactant. The mixture is subsequently stirred at 20 - 100°C, preferably at 25 - 50°C, until the reaction has gone to completion. Work-up is carried out in a customary manner, for example by pouring the reaction mixture into water and extracting the product of value. Solvents which are particularly suitable for this purpose are methylene chloride, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The organic phase is dried and the solvent removed, and the crude ester can then be used for the rearrangement without further purification.<br>
The rearrangement of the esters to the compounds of the formula I is advantageously carried out at 20 - 40°C in a solvent and in the presence of a base and, if appropriate, using a cyano compound as catalyst.<br><br>
Suitable solvents are, for example, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, ethyl acetate, toluene or mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents ate acetonitrile, dioxane and dimethoxyethane.<br>
Suitable bases are tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, pyridine or alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, which are preferably employed in equimolar amounts or in excess of up to four times, based on the ester. Preference is given to using triethylamine or alkali metal carbonate, preferably in twice the equimolar ratio, based on the ester.<br>
Suitable cyano compounds are inorganic cyanides, such as sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, and organic cyano compounds, such as acetone cyanohydrin, trimethylsilyl cyanide. They are employed in an amount of from 1 to 50 mole percent, based on the ester. Preference is given to using acetone cyanohydrin or trimethylsilyl cyanide, for example in an amount of from 5 to 15, preferably 10, mole percent, based on the ester.<br>
work-up can be carried out in a manner known per se. The reaction mixture is, for example, aC1dified with dilute mineral aC1d, such as 5% strength hydrochloric aC1d or sulfuric aC1d, and extracted with an organic solvent, for example methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The organic extract can be extracted with 5-10% strength alkali metal carbonate solution, for example sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate solution. The aqueous phase is aC1dified and the resulting preC1pitate is filtered off with suction and/or extracted with methylene chloride or ethyl acetate, dried and concentrated. (Examples of the preparation of esters of hydroxypyrazoles and the rearrangement of the esters are given, for example, in EP-A 282 944 and US 4 643 757).<br>
However, it may also be advantageous to generate the crude ester in situ and to carry out the rearrangement without isolation or purification of the ester.<br>
Process B:<br>
Reaction of 3—{4,5-dihydroisoxazol-5—yljbenzoylpyrazoles of the formula I  (where R*2 = H) with a compound of the formula V:<br><br><br>
L2 is a nucleophilically replaceable leaving groups, such as halogen, for example bromine, chlorine, hetaryl, for example iraidazolyl, pyridyl, sulfonate.<br>
The compounds of the formula V can be employed directly, such as, for example, in the case of the sulfonyl halides, sulfonic anhydrides, or be generated in situ, for example activated sulfonic aC1ds (using sulfonic aC1d and dicyclohexylcarbonyldiimide, carbonyIdiimidazole, etc.).<br>
The starting materials are generally employed in equimolar amounts. However, it can also be advantageous to use an excess of one component or the other.<br>
If appropriate, it may be advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of a base. The reactants and the auxiliary base are then advantageously employed in equimolar amounts. An excess of auxiliary base, for example 1.5 to 3 molar equivalents, based on II, may be advantageous in certain cases.<br>
Suitable auxiliary bases are tertiary alkylamines, such as' triethylamine, pyridine, alkali metal carbonates, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and alkali metal hydrides, for example sodium hydride. Preference is given to using triethylamine and pyridine.<br><br>
Suitable solvents are, for example, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, 1,2—dichloroethane, aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, ethers, such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or esters, such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In general, the reaction temperature is in the range from 0°C to the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
Work-up can be carried out in a manner known per se to afford the product.<br>
The pyrazoles of the formula II (where R12 = B) used as starting materials are known or can be prepared by processes known per se (for example EP-A 240 001 and J. Prakt. Chem. 31S (1973), 383).<br>

The 3-(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-5-yl)benzoylpyrazoles of the formula I and their agriculturally useful salts are suitable as herbiC1des, both in the form of isomer mixtures and in the form of the pure isomers. The herbiC1dal compositions comprising compounds of the formula I effect very good control of vegetation on non-crop areas, espeC1ally at high rates of application. In crops such as wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and cotton they act against broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds without damaging the crop plants substantially. This effect is observed espeC1ally at low rates of application.<br>
Depending on the application method in question, the compounds of the formula I, or herbiC1dal compositions comprising them, can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are the following:<br>

Moreover, the compounds of the formula I can also be used in crops which tolerate the action of herbiC1des due to breeding including genetic engineering methods.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, or the herbiC1dal compositions comprising them, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or<br><br>
dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention.<br>
The herbiC1dal compositions comprise a herbiC1dally active amount of at least one compound of the formula I or of an agriculturally useful salt of I and auxiliaries conventionally used for the formulation of crop protection products.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries are essentially:<br>
mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, eg. paraffins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, for example amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the 3-(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-5-yl)benzoylpyrazoles, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants (adjuvants) are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic aC1ds, for example ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and<br>
dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic aC1d, and of fatty aC1ds, of alkyl-and alkylaryl sulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic aC1ds, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl, tributylphenyl polyglycol ether,<br><br>

Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bolus, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calC1um sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic material, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the compounds of the formula I in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of at least one active ingredient. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NKR spectrum).<br>
The formulation examples below illustrate the preparation of such products t<br>

The compounds of the formula I, or the herbiC1dal compositions comprising them, can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbiC1dal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little contact as possible, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
Depending on the intended aim of the control measures, the season, the target plants and the growth stage, the application rates of the compound of the formula I are from 0.001 to 3.0, preferably 0.01 to 1.0 kg/ha of active substance (a.s.).<br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to achieve synergistic effects, the 3-{4,5-dihydroisoxazol-5-yl)benzoylpyrazoles of the formula I can be mixed and applied jointly with a large number of representatives of other groups of herbiC1dally or growth-regulatory active ingredients. Suitable components in mixtures are, for example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric aC1d and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, aryloxy-/hetaryloxyalkanic aC1ds and their derivatives, benzoic aC1d and its derivatives, benzothiadiazinones, 2—(hetaroyl/aroyl)—1,3-cyclohexanediones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzylisoxazolidinones, meta-CFs-phenyl derivatives, carbamates, guinolinecarboxylic aC1d and its derivatives, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexenone oxime ether derivatives, diazines, dichloropropionic aC1d and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofuranes, dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic aC1ds and their derivatives, ureas, 3-phenyluraC1ls, imidazoles, imidazolinonea,<br>

Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the compounds of the formula I, alone or in combination with other herbiC1des, in the form of a mixture with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pestiC1des or agents for controlling pftytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the misC1bility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element defiC1enC1es. NOn-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added.<br>
use Examples<br>
The herbiC1dal action of the<br>
3-(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-5-yl)benzoylpyrazoles of the formula I was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments!<br>
The culture containers used were plastic flowerpots containing loamy sand with approximately 3.0% of humus as substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown separately for each speC1es.<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the active ingredients, suspended or emulsified in water, were applied directly after sowing by means of finely distributing nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and subsequently covered with transparent plastic hoods until the plants had rooted. This cover caused uniform germination of the test plants unless this wa's adversely affected by the active ingredients.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were grown to a plant height of from 3 to 15 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated with the active ingredients which had been suspended or emulsified in water. To this end, the test plants were either sown directly and grown in the same containers, or they were first grown separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to treatment. The rate of application for the post-emergence treatment was 125 or 62.5 g/ha a.s. (active substance).<br>
Depending on the speC1es, the plants were kept at from 10 to 25°C and 20 to 35°C, respectively. The test period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br><br>
Evaluation was carried out using a scale of from 0 to 100. 100 means no emergence of the plants, or complete destruction of at least the aerial parts, and 0 means no damage or normal course of growth.<br>
The plants used in the greenhouse experiments belonged to the following speC1es:<br><br>
At an application rate of 125 or 62.5 g/ha of a.s., the compound 2.7 showed very good activity against the abovementioned harmful plants and was compatible with spring wheat.<br>
In contrast, at the same application rates, the comparative compound A (compound 20 from Table 1) known from WO 97/41118 caused damage in the crop plant spring wheat, and had a weaker herbiC1dal activity against the harmful plants mentioned.<br><br><br><br>
