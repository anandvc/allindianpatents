				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Thia invention relates to a device useful for operating gas<br>
cylinders having leaky cylinder valves.<br>
The device of the present invention is particularly useful for<br>
being used with the pressure cylinders containing liquefied gases<br>
such as ammonia, chlorine, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide,<br>
freon, having leaky gas regulating valves.<br>
Pressure cylinders for storage of gases in liquefied form are<br>
provided with valve fittings generally made either of steel or<br>
special steel body and monel or steel seatings. The valve head of<br>
such cylinders have a provision to connect a gas regulating valve<br>
which are of diaphragm type.<br>
There are often cases of corrosion of cylinder valve seating and<br>
valve spindle which result in the following:<br>
1.	sticking of the valve due to corroded seatings, thus making<br>
it impossible to open or close the valve properly.<br>
2.	breaking of the valve spindle when an attempt is made to<br>
open or close the corroded valve with excessive force thus<br>
making it impossible to operate the valve.<br>
In both the above said situations the contents of the cylinders cannot be used either due to leakage around the cylinder valve or due to inability to operate the regulating valve. In certain cases where there is a leakage around the gas regulating valve fitted on the cylinder, then the following drawbacks are observed:<br>
a)	A gas regulating valve connected to such a cylinder will be<br>
of no use as when 'the cylinder valve is opened the gas will<br>
have a tendency to leak through the valve rather than<br>
through the  regulating valve due to higher resistance to<br>
flow by the latter than the former.<br>
b)	If the flow of gas is to be measured then such leaking<br>
cylinders do not give correct values.<br>
c)	If the gases contained in the cylinder are corrosive and<br>
toxic like chlorine,ammonia and sulphur dioxide then there<br>
will be environmental problem.<br>
To the best of our knowledge there is no such device available which allows operation of gas cylinders having leaky cylinder valves.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for operating gas cylinder valves.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device which will enable use of leaky cylinder and avoid damage/environmental hazards.<br>
In figures 1 and 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification schematic embodiments of the device of the present invention have been depicted.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful for operating gas cylinders having leaky cylinder valves, which comprises a main body (1) having a chamber (11), the top (2) of the said body being provided with an opening and a leak proof<br>
gland (6) in such a manner so as to allow a spindle (3) to pass through it, the opening being provided at its bottom with internal threading (5}, the top of the said spindle being provided with a handle {7) and at its bottom portion being provided with suitable external threading matching the internal threading (5) of the said opening of the body, the bottom of the said spindle (3) being provided with means (4) capable of opening a leaky gas cylinder valve, the said chamber (11) being provided at its bottom end with means (8, 10) so as to enable fitment of the device on to a cylinder top, the said chamber (11) being also provided with an outlet (9) so as to enable connection to a conventional gas regulator.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention fig. 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification shows a body (1) and having a top portion (2), having right handed threads capable of fitting on the cylinder head, handles (8) on both sides of the base of the device, a handle (7) to operate spindle (3) passing through a stuffing box (6) which is connected to steel jaw (4) through square screw threads (5) and a side outlet (9) to be connected to a conventional gas regulator. The metallic body (1) in the form of cup with a flanged top (2) with the stuffing box (6) may be of suitable metal depending on the gas handled which may be selected from cast iron, steel or stainless steel or brass. The central spindle (3) with square threads operating through a guide (5) which screwed in to (2) at the end of the spindle (3) connected to steel jaws (4) are attached so that they can be moved with the spindle. The central spindle (3) may be operated with<br>
handle (7) to operate the valve of the cylinder through steel jaws (4). the side opening (9) is provided on the body (1) to fix the regulator so that gas can be drawn.<br>
It is a feature of the present invention that the device is suitable for cylinders with valves such as shown in figures 2 and 3 of the drawings accompanying this specification. Conventionally if a gas cylinder has a leaky valve it is not possible to put it into use by using conventional regulators, as the gas will come out through the valve itself instead of the regulator because the regulator offers more resistance to flow of the gas, thus allowing the gas to leak through the valve itself. The use of the  device of the present invention is described below:<br>
When the device of the present invention is fixed onto a cylinder having leaky valve using threads (10), the gas leaked will accumulate in the chamber (11) instead of flowing to the atmosphere. Operating spindle (3) with the help of handle (7) the leaky valve of the gas cylinder is opened/removed. Thereafter any common regulator can be fixed onto the outlet (9), thus allowing usage of the gas cylinder having leaky valve.<br>
The main advantages of the device of the present invention are:<br>
1.  The contents of a gas cylinder with a leaky valve can be<br>
used without any hazard. 3.  Commonly used gas regulating valves can be connected to the<br>
appliance to control the flow of gas.<br>
3.	The device makes operations safe even with the corrosive and<br>
toxic gases.<br>
4.	The device can be economically and easily fabricated with<br>
suitable common material of construction such as cast iron,<br>
steel, stainless steel, metal-polymer composites depending<br>
upon the nature of the gas.<br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1.	A device useful for operating gas cylinders having leaky<br>
cylinder valves, which comprises a main body (1) having a<br>
chamber (11), the top (2) of the said body being provided<br>
with an opening and a leak proof gland (6) in such a manner<br>
so as to allow a spindle (3) to pass through it, the opening<br>
being provided at its bottom with internal threading (5),<br>
the top of the said spindle being provided with a handle (7)<br>
and at its bottom portion being provided with suitable<br>
external threading matching the internal threading (5) of<br>
the said opening of the body, the bottom of the said spindle<br>
(3) being provided with means (4) capable of opening a leaky<br>
gas cylinder valve, the said chamber (11) being provided at<br>
its bottom end with means (8, 10) so as to enable fitment of<br>
the device on to a cylinder top, the said chamber (11) being<br>
also provided with an outlet (9) so as to enable connection<br>
to a conventional gas regulator.<br>
2.	A device useful for operating gas cylinders having leaky<br>
cylinder valves substantially as herein described with<br>
reference to figures 1 and 4 of the drawings accompanying<br>
this specification.<br></td>
