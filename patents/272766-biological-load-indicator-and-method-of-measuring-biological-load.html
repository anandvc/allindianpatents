DESCRIPTION<br>
BIOLOGICAL LOAD INDICATOR AND METHOD OF MEASURING BIOLOGICAL LOAD<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to biological load indicators and methods for measuring biological loads. Specifically, the present invention relates to the technical field for objectively evaluating biological loads such as stress and fatigue by molecular-biological approaches.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Mental stress and/or physical stress affects host defense mechanisms including nervous, endocrine and immune systems (see non-patent references 1 and 2). Various cytokines (such as IL-ip, IL-6, and TNF-a) are upregulated by stress (see non¬patent references 1 and 3) . This suggests that cytokines are likely to be involved in interference with host defense (see non-patent reference 4). However, the molecular mechanism of the induction of host defense-reducing cytokines by stress is not fully understood. [0003]<br>
Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a cytokine that was discovered as an interferon-y (I FN-y)-inducing factor (see non-patent reference 5, patent reference 1).  IL-18 has various biological activities such as Fas ligand induction, elevation of the cytolytic activity of T cells (see non-patent reference 6), and production of IL-4 and IL-13 (see non-patent reference 7). IL-18 activates Toll-like receptor 2 (see non-patent reference 9) and myeloid differentiation protein (Myd)-88 (see non¬patent reference 10). These activations are necessary for IL-6 induction (see non-patent reference 11). Therefore, IL-18 is<br>
 <br>
involved in the production of both Thl and Th2 cytokines See<br>
non-patent reference 12).<br>
[0004]<br>
IL-18 is produced as a 24 kD precursor protein that is processed to a 18 kD mature active form by an IL-ip converting enzyme (ICE, also called caspase-1) (see non-patent reference 13) . Caspase-1 is induced as an inactive precursor protein procaspase-1 that is activated by caspase-11 (see non-patent reference 14).  It is reported that caspase-11 mRNA expression involves trans-activation of NF-KB (see non-patent reference 15), which is mediated by P38MAP kinase (see non-patent reference 16).  It is also reported that the induction of caspase-11 mRNA by LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and the following activation of caspase-1 are inhibited by SB203580, a P38MAP kinase inhibitor, in a glioma cell line C6 (see non-patent reference 17). [0005]<br>
Recent studies report that IL-18 mRNA is expressed in an adrenal gland in response to an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cold stress (see non-patent reference 18).  It is also reported that different promoters are used for IL-18 mRNA expression in an adrenal gland and an immune cell (see non¬patent reference 19). However, both studies described above are silent on the induction of mature IL-18.  On the other hand, it is reported that IL-18 in blood plasma increases in psychiatric patients (see non-patent reference 20). [0006]<br>
In society today, people work and live under various types of stress.  In general, there are differences in sensory perception of stress among individuals, and there is no specific indicator of the presence or absence of stress or the intensity of stress. As a result of investigations, the inventor has found that stress causes an increase in cytokines such as IL-18 and have revealed the flow of signal transduction with IL-18 at the top of the stress cascade, so<br>
 <br>
that stress can be objectively evaluated (see patent referents®-* 2, non-patent references 21 - 23). patent reference 1: JP-A-8-193098 patent reference 2: WO2006/003927<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
A living organism has a mechanism to keep its biological functions constant in response to loads and stimuli.  Such a mechanism is called homeostasis or host-defense mechanism.  It is known that mental, physiological, physical, or chemical stress and/or fatigue acts as a load on homeostasis or host-defense mechanism and that various diseases are caused by breakdown of homeostasis or host-defense mechanism.<br>
A load on homeostasis or host-defense mechanism, such as stress, fatigue and blues can further cause mental disorders, physical disorders, and even suicide, and is a serious challenge to health. However, evaluation of such conditions basically accompanied by subjective symptoms has been possible only by self-assessment.  It has also been very difficult to detect abnormalities by known biochemical or psychological tests, and therefore, it has been impossible to make objective evaluations, grasp severity or develop some remedies. Various biochemical or physiological indicators have been proposed.<br>
 <br>
However, hormones or amines are instable and difficult to be quantified, and therefore, they are not suitable as indications, although their level can change in conjunction with stress.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide techniques capable of objectively and specifically evaluating various loads on living organisms, of which evaluation was conventionally possible only by subjective symptom-dependent methods, such as fatigue.  Since living organisms feel discomfort when they recognize loads on biological homeostasis and host-defense mechanism, the object of the present invention necessarily encompasses to provide techniques capable of objectively and specifically evaluating a feeling of discomfort or comfort in living organisms.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0013]<br>
In the present invention, the characteristics to be evaluated may be classified into the state of loads in a living organism and the pathological condition of a living organism.  In the present invention, the evaluation or determination level is, in the case of a state, the state itself and the degree of manifestation of the state, and in the case of a pathological condition, the type and degree of the manifested pathological condition. Concerning pathological conditions which manifest themselves but for which no objective evaluation criterion has been conventionally found, the present invention also aims to provide criteria for evaluating such pathological conditions through the approach of monitoring potential conditions, specifically, variations in cytokines or chemokines in a living organism.

In the present invention, factors constituting the indicating agent, such as cytokines and chemokines, are preferably placed in different containers.  In the present invention the indicating agent may contain any other component, as long as it is mainly composed of the factors such as cytokines and chemokines. Examples of other components include, but are not limited to, a solvent such as a buffer and a saline, a stabilizing agent, a bacteriostatic agent, and a preservative. [0062]<br>
In the present invention, the indicating agent serves to indicate that the physiological state of an animal is accompanied by stress or fatigue, preferably fatigue caused by mental stress. In particular, the degree of fatigue can be readily and quantitatively determined using the above-described factors, for the indicator, in a biological sample from an animal, preferably in blood plasma, serum, saliva, or urine.  For example, in the case of a mouse, the content of IL-18 in serum is 100 pg/ml or less before the application of mental stress, and it becomes 120 to 200 pg/ml 5 hours after the application of 1 hour stress and exceeds 1000 pg/ml after the application of 6 hour stress. The content of IL-18 increases as the stress load increases.  Since the half-life of<br>
 <br>
IL-18 is about 10 hours, the IL-18-containing indicating agent is preferably used as a fatigue indicator.  In addition to IL-18 , an increase in the amount of various factors as describe above in a living organism can indicate fatigue.  Specifically at least two factors constituting the indicating agent of the present invention are preferably provided in amounts for indicating a normal level to a weak fatigue level or a strong fatigue level such that a comparison with samples can be made. [0063]<br>
The agent for testing stress or fatigue of the present invention characteristically contains at least two kinds of molecules selected from the group consisting of molecules specifically recognizing IL-lp, IL-lra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, Eotaxin, FGF basic, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-y, IFN-oc, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-lcc, MIP-lp, PDGF-BB, RANTES, TNF-a, VEGF, CSF-2, TGF-p, neurotrophin 5, MCP-3, p-2-microglobulin, angiotensin II, CSF-3, CXC chemokine ligand 1, CXC chemokine ligand 5 and HGF, respectively. [0064]<br>
Examples of the molecules include antibodies, peptides (other than antibodies), nucleic acids, and low-molecular-weight compounds. Antibodies are preferred, because they are relatively easy to obtain or produce. [0065]<br>
The "antibodies" include polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, single-stranded antibodies, and antigen-binding part of the above antibodies, such as F(ab')2 or Fab' fragments or fragments produced with i Fab expression libraries. [0066]<br>
The "peptides (other than antibodies)" include protein components capable of specifically binding to the factors (specific proteins), and examples include cytokine-binding ; proteins, cytokine receptors, cytokine soluble receptors, or<br>
 <br>
binding sites thereof. [0067]<br>
The "nucleic acids" include any nucleic acids having an specific base sequence capable of binding to the factors (specific proteins), and examples include DNAs, RNAs or nucleic acid analogues. [0068]<br>
The "low-molecular-weight compounds" include organic or inorganic low-molecular-weight compounds designed based on the three-dimensional structure and electrostatic properties of the peptide. [0069]<br>
The antibodies may be produced by conventional methods (Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, Chapter 11.12 -11.13(2000)).  Specifically, polyclonal antibodies may be produced by a process including the steps of immunizing non-human animals such as rabbits with any of the factors, which is expressed with E. coli or the like and purified by conventional techniques, or with a synthetic oligopeptide, having part of the amino acid sequence of any of the factors, by conventional techniques, and obtaining polyclonal antibodies from the serum of the immunized animals by conventional techniques. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies may be produced by a process including the steps of immunizing non-human animals such as mice with any of the factors, which is expressed with E. coli or the like and purified by conventional techniques, or with an oligopeptide having part of the amino acid sequence of any of the factors, preparing hybridoma cells by cell fusion between the resulting spleen cells and myeloma cells, and culturing the hybridoma cells (Current protocols in Molecular Biology edit. Ausubel et al. (1987) Publish. John Wiley and Sons. Section 11.4 - 11.11). Chimeric antibodies may also be produced based on, for example, the techniques described in Jikken Igaku (Experimental Medicine), Extra Edition, Vol. 6, No. 10, 1988 or Japanese<br>
 <br>
Patent Publication (JP-B) No. 03-73280.  F(ab')2 or Fab' may be produced by treating immunoglobulins with a proteolytic enzyme such as pepsin or papain. [0070]<br>
The test agent may contain the antibody in a free form, a labeled form or an immobilized form. The test agent of the present invention may also contain a carrier, which is generally contained in diagnostic agents. Examples of such a carrier include, but are not limited to, a preservative, a stabilizing agent, a buffer, a solvent such as water or a saline and the like. [0071]<br>
The present invention provides a method for measuring stress or fatigue, including the step of measuring the amounts of factors in a biological sample with the test agent. [0072]<br>
In the stress or fatigue measurement method, the amounts of the factors in a biological sample, preferably in blood plasma, serum, saliva, or urine, may be quantitatively measured with the molecules in the test agent, preferably with the antibodies in the test agent, by publicly known methods. Systems that allow simple and simultaneous measurement of a number of proteins preferably include liquid-phase protein array systems (such as Bio-Plex (trade name) Suspension Array System (manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories)) in which protein recognition sensor-carrying microbeads are used to perform a binding reaction in a liquid suspension of the microbeads. When such array systems are used, measurement is possible in a wide range of a few pg/ml to several tens ng/ml. [0073]<br>
The measured amount of each factor in the biological sample may be compared with the level of the stress or fatigue indicating agent so that the degree of stress or fatigue in the animal can be objectively and qualitatively or quantitatively evaluated.<br>
 <br>
[0074]<br>

In the present invention, the indicating agent of the intensity of mental conditions or disorders includes at least two kinds of factors that are selected from the group described above and are each weighted.  In order to make the indicating agent more specific to the intensity of each mental condition or disorder, 3 to 41 kinds of factors, preferably 3 to 28 kinds, more preferably 5 to 20 kinds, even more preferably 8 to 12 kinds should be selected. [0123]<br>
In the present invention, factors constituting the indicating agent of the intensity of mental conditions or disorders, such as cytokines and chemokines, are preferably placed in different containers. In the present invention, the indicating agent of mental conditions may contain any other component, as long as it is mainly composed of the factors such as cytokines and chemokines. Examples of other components include, but are not limited to, a solvent such as a buffer<br>
 <br>
and a saline, a stabilizing agent, a bacteriostatic agent, a preservative and the like. [0124]<br>
The indicating agent of the intensity of a mental condition or disorder according to the present invention may-serve as an objective indicator in the field of animal mental health.  In particular, factors in an animal biological sample, preferably in blood plasma, serum, saliva, or urine, may be each weighted to constitute the indicating agent so that various mental conditions can be readily and quantitatively determined. [0125]<br>
In the present invention, the indicating agent of fatigue or the indicating agent of the intensity of a mental condition or disorder may comprise a combination of numerical values of weighted factors,. namely a database. When the indicating agent is a database, various mental conditions can be readily and quantitatively determined for each item from the values measured with the test agent of the invention. [0126]<br>
The agent for testing intensity of mental conditions or mental disorders of the present invention characteristically contains at least two kinds of molecule selected from the group consisting of molecules specifically recognizing the aforementioned factors (IL-1{5, IL-lra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, Eotaxin, FGF basic, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-y, IFN-cc, IP-10, MCP-1, MlP-la, MIP-ip, PDGF-BB, RANTES, TNF-a, VEGF, CSF-2, TGF-p, neurotrophin 5, MCP-3, p-2-microglobulin, angiotensin II, CSF-3, CXC chemokine ligand 1, CXC chemokine ligand 5 and HGF, respectively). [0127]<br>
The molecules and other components contained in the agent for testing mental conditions or disorders of the present invention-may be the same as those contained in the agent for<br>
 <br>
testing stress or fatigue. [0128]<br>
The present invention also provides a method for measuring the intensity of a mental condition or disorder, including the steps of: measuring the amounts of factors in a biological sample with the agent for testing the intensity of a mental condition or disorder; and proportionally weighting each of the amounts obtained in the measuring step and comparing the weighted amounts with the indicating agent of the intensity of the mental condition or disorder. [0129]<br>
In the method for measuring the intensity of a mental condition or disorder, the concentrations of the factors in a biological sample, preferably in blood plasma, serum, saliva, or urine, may be measured with the molecules, preferably antibodies, in the agent for testing the intensity of the mental condition or disorder, by publicly known methods.  For example, the system that allows simple and simultaneous measurement of a number of proteins is preferably Bio-Plex Suspension Array System (manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories). [0130]<br>
The value obtained by multiplying the measured amount of each factor in the biological sample by a coefficient is compared with the indicating agent of the mental condition so that the mental condition of an animal can be objectively and quantitatively evaluated. [0131]<br>
The animal is preferably a vertebrate including human and particularly preferably a domestic or companion animal such as cattle, horse, pig, sheep, goat, chicken, dog, cat and the like. The method for measuring the intensity of a mental condition or disorder of the present invention may be applied to a domestic or companion animal.  In the field of livestock or pet business where artificial rearing tends to cause stress, therefore, the intensity of the mental condition or disorder<br>
 <br>
of an animal can be objectively monitored, which is advantageous for grasping the mental health of the animal. [0132]<br>
The kit for testing the intensity of a mental condition or disorder of the present invention includes the molecules, preferably at least two kinds of antibodies, placed in different compartments. The test kit may include any other reagent such as a buffer for dilution of the reagent or the biological sample, a fluorescent dye, a reaction vessel, a positive control, a negative control, test protocol instructions and the like. Mental conditions can be easily measured using the test kit of the present invention. [0133]<br>
According to the present invention, the levels of the factors in various mental conditions or disorders can be analyzed with high throughput.  Individual differences can also be easily found based on the findings obtained by the present invention. Therefore, the present invention may be applied to discover new genes based on individual differences in the response of cytokine level to stress or may be applied to screening for stress resistance. The present invention may also be used to determine the anti-stress effect of anti-stress drugs. The present invention can provide the following advantages:<br>
1.	A set uniquely developed for stress indication may be used for measurement;<br>
2.	All the factors can be measured using 50 (il of a blood plasma or serum sample;<br>
3.	The entire process can be completed in about 6 hours; and<br>
4.	All of the resulting data may be compiled into a database, which can be easily statistically processed.<br>
[0134]<br>
When the advantages are exploited for measurement of stress and so on, stress or other mental conditions can be grasped in a significantly inexpensive and speedy manner, as<br>
 <br>
compared with conventional methods in which data are collected through an interview by a physician or psychologist and with a questionnaire and then compiled over several days to be evaluated (so that the result can vary between the facilities).<br>
Examples<br>
[0135]<br>
The invention is more specifically described below with some examples, and so on which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.  In the examples described below, before volunteer subjects underwent different tests and blood collection, approval of the ethical committee of the facility and then an informed consent were obtained in advance. [0136] Example 1: Scales of Mental Condition and Fatigue Condition<br>
Psychological tests by questionnaire methods (SDS, MAS, GHQ, STAI, and CMI), a subjective symptom survey (prepared by Institute of Occupational Health), and surveys with a social phobia scale, an anthropophobia scale and a uniquely developed life situation questionnaire were performed on 402 volunteer subjects, so that it was confirmed that they were healthy. After the health check, 1 ml of blood was collected from each subject on a holiday morning and at the same time point after a night shift, respectively, and placed in an anticoagulant-containing blood collection spitz. Plasma was then separated from the blood under cooling at 4°C. The blood plasma was frozen and stored or stored on ice, and then the cytokines shown separately were simultaneously measured with a microbead protein array system (Bio-Plex Suspension Array System manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories and modified by ourselves). The cytokines were also measured by a conventional ELISA method, and the concentration of each cytokine in the blood was determined. [0137]<br>
An example of .the result is shown in Fig. la.  The result<br>
 <br>
was obtained by a process including determining the concentration of each cytokine in the blood, then calculating a correlation coefficient for each cytokine concentration in blood, and coloring high correlation values (with correlation coefficients of 0.50 to 0.6499 in light gray, 0.65 to 0.7999 in dark gray, 0.8 to 0.9999 in black; concerning the relative risk of correlation, p 
1 subjects who were healthy but frequently work night shifts were examined as to whether the cytokine correlation could reflect the presence or absence of a night shift and was useful to discriminate between before and after a night shift. It is apparent that the correlation with the concentration of each cytokine in blood has changed between Fig. lb (before a night shift) and Fig. lc (after a night shift).  It is recognized that the concentrations at the same time point after the night shift significantly deviated from normal values. Based on the cytokine correlation, a logistic<br>
1 regression analysis was performed on the data from 90 people randomly sampled from the subjects to determine whether discrimination between before and after a night shift was possible according to the present invention. The result is shown in Fig. Id. In this example, the accuracy was 88%. Each cytokine value was multiplied by a certain coefficient for each of the items of depression, anxiety, fear, and stress in the psychological test, so that scores were produced. The resulting scores agreed with the results of interview by a psychiatrist more clearly than the psychological test, and therefore, it was possible to detect a tendency to depression, anxiety, or stress.  This shows that different mental conditions (such as depression, excitement, tension, anxiety and the like) can be grasped and evaluated by the measurement method of the present invention. [0138]<br>
 <br>
Example 2: Scale of Mental Fatigue or Physical Fatigue and Scale of Stress ■<br>
Twenty-eight to 30 healthy volunteers underwent a Kraepelin test in which they continued simple calculation a.s z load on mental fatigue for 3 hours or a test in which an aerobic treadmill exercise to increase the 1-minute pulse rate to 180 was applied as a load on physical fatigue for 3 hours. Before and after each test, blood was collected and subjected to the measurement of cytokines in the same way as in Example 1.  The cytokines were also measured in the same way 24 hours after the start of the load (21 hours after the end of the load). The result was obtained by calculating a correlation coefficient for each cytokine concentration in blood and coloring high correlation values.<br>
The result showed that the correlation with the total cytokines changed before and after each test and during the recovery period. A  comparison between the calculation for the mental load and the calculation for the treadmill exercise as the physical load showed that a certain combination of cytokines made a difference in the strength of the correlation and that fatigue and stress conditions can be grasped and evaluated by the measurement method of the present invention.<br>
Based oh the cytokine correlation, a logistic regression analysis was performed on the data from all the subjects to determine whether it was possible to discriminate between the Kraepelin test as a mental load and the treadmill exercise as a physical load. The result is shown in the drawings. The result showed that: it was possible to distinguish between a long loading time and a short loading time with respect to both the Kraepelin test and the treadmill test (in the example, the accuracy was 100% for the Kraepelin test and 81% for the treadmill test) ; it was also possible to show a difference in the recovery time between the subjects (in the example, the accuracy was 81% for the Kraepelin test and 100% for the treadmill test) ; and it was also possible to determine which<br>
 <br>
load (Kraepelin load or treadmill load) was applied (in the example, the accuracy was 100%). This suggests that according to the present invention, not only the presence or absence of fatigue but also the type and level of fatigue can be classified, identified, or evaluated.  It is also suggested that the improvement effect or effect of factors such as drugs, food products and living habits on mental fatigue or physical fatigue can be clearly shown using the accuracies shown in the classification tables obtained according to the present invention and taking into account that the recovery degree under the standard conditions may depend on drugs, food products, living habits and so on. [0139]<br>
Example 3: Scales for Diagnosis and Evaluation of Mental Disorders<br>
Psychological tests by questionnaire methods (SDS, MAS, GHQ, STAI, SCID, and CMI), a subjective symptom survey (prepared by Institute of Occupational Health), and surveys with a social phobia scale, an anthropophobia scale and a uniquely developed life situation questionnaire were performed, as much as possible, on 160 volunteers diagnosed as having mental disorders according DSM-IV international diagnostic criteria.<br>
Concurrently with the surveys, 1 ml of blood was collected from each volunteer and placed in an anticoagulant-containing blood collection spitz.  Plasma was then separated from the blood under cooling at 4°C. The blood plasma was frozen and stored or stored on ice, and then the cytokines shown separately were simultaneously measured with a microbead protein array system (Bio-Plex Suspension Array System manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories and modified by ourselves). The cytokines were also measured by a conventional ELISA method, and the concentration of each cytokine in the blood was determined. On the other hand, all the volunteers each had a psychiatrically structured interview so that their<br>
60<br>
 <br>
psychological tendency and conditions were grasped.<br>
Each cytokine value was multiplied by a certain coefficient to produce scores. The resulting scores agreed with the results of interview by a psychiatrist more clearly than the psychological test, and therefore, it was possible to detect a tendency to mental conditions (depression, anxiety, stress, tension, and excitement). Although the psychological test scores are not disclosed for maintenance of the confidentiality of personal information of each patient, Fig. 3 shows cytokine correlation coefficients for patients with depression, and Fig. 4 shows cytokine correlation coefficients for patients with schizophrenia. The results were obtained by calculating a correlation coefficient for each cytokine concentration in blood and coloring high correlation values. It is apparent that the results each differ from the correlation coefficient table of the healthy subjects shown in Fig. 1. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether it was possible to correctly diagnose depression according to the present invention. As a result, the accuracy was 91%.<br>
A logistic regression analysis was also performed to determine whether it was possible to correctly diagnose schizophrenia according to the present invention. As a result, the accuracy was 96%.<br>
The results show that different mental disorders (such as depression, schizophrenia, excitement, tension, anxiety and the like) can be grasped and evaluated by the cytokine measurement method according to the present invention. The results also show that psychiatric diagnosis or therapy validation, which would conventionally significantly depend on empirical determination and tend to be ambiguous, can be definitely made using the cytokine measurement and that the cytokine measurement would be useful for evaluation of therapeutic regimen efficacy. Mental conditions are often not externalized even though they are in a pathological state, and<br>
 <br>
this adds to the problem in the current society. .It has been found, however, that based on the above correlation found according to the present invention, diagnosis or assessment of depression and schizophrenia, two major diseases in the field of psychiatry, can be satisfactorily performed according to the present invention. [0140]<br>
Predictions about dementia (senile dementia of Alzheimer type, Alzheimer disease and Pick disease) and central neurodegenerative diseases (OPCA, Parkinson disease, and diffuse Lewy body disease), if possible, should greatly contribute to the QOL of patients. According to the present invention, discrimination between depression, mild dementia and central neurodegenerative disease is possible at a stage where dementia or central neurodegenerative disease is not manifested. Therefore, it is expected that grouping of mild dementia or mild degenerative disease as proposed in the field of psychiatry can be achieved. [0141]<br>
According to the present invention, the use of the correlation found between mental condition, fatigue or stress level and levels of the factors in blood, urine or saliva allows simple, inexpensive and objective evaluation of the risk or degree of stress, fatigue or dysthymia (particularly blues). The allocation of the score to each of the selected cytokines may be modified so that stress, fatigue and dysthymia (particularly blues) can each be rated on an optimum scale in a single measurement procedure, and this is widely applicable.<br>
Therefore, stress, fatigue or dysthymia (blues) can be objectively evaluated and their degree can be grasped.  Since cytokines are causative agents or exacerbation factors in various diseases, care and preventive measures can be provided from the standpoint of the integration of mind and body.<br>
 <br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0142]<br>
According to the invention, the intensity of externa] loads or the effect of the loads can be evaluated or predicted, when temporary biological reactions occur.  Specifically, external load-induced fatigue and relief from the fatigue can be evaluated, so that the individual's tendency to become fatigued or the individual's resilience can be evaluated.  In addition, the degree of the effect of a certain factor on the individual's tendency to become fatigued or the individual's resilience can also be evaluated. Therefore, the application of the present invention to the field of occupational health may lead to prevention of occupational accidents.  In addition, the present invention can contribute to the development of stress-relieving pharmaceuticals, food products, daily necessities, designs, images, sounds, buildings, residential environments, and so on. [0143]<br>
According to the present invention, evaluation of disease states, recognition of potential pathological conditions, and detection of diseases before the manifestation of subjective symptoms are possible in a living organism with constant pathological conditions. Therefore, the present invention allows early detection and early treatment of pathological conditions, evaluation of treatment effects, determination of whether therapies are effective or ineffective, and unified detection and management of many pathological conditions (such as skin disorders caused by ultraviolet rays and so on, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, pemphigus, ichthyosis, optic hyperesthesia, burns including inflammatory skin changes as pathological conditions, radiation dermatosis, Alzheimer disease, senile dementia of Alzheimer type, diffuse Lewy body disease, Pick disease, Binswanger disease, Parkinson disease, Parkinson syndrome, cerebral ischemia, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, carbon monoxide poisoning,<br>
