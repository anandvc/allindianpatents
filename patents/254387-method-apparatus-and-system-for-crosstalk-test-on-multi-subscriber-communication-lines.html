COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Method, Apparatus and System for Crosstalk Test on Multi-subscriber Communication Lines<br>
2.	APPLICANT:<br>
Name: HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD.<br>
Nationality: P. R. China<br>
Address:   Huawei   Administration  Building,   Bantian,   Longgang  District   Shenzhen, Guangdong, P. R. China.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to network communication technologies, and in particular, to a technology for crosstalk test on multi-subscriber communication lines.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology has evolved over the years of development from the first generation ADSL, the second generation ADSL2 and ADSL2+, to the latest very high speed digital subscriber line2 (VDSL2). With the increase of frequency band, bandwidth also increases. ADSL and ADSL2, with the downlink spectrum lower than 1.1 MHz, provide downlink rates as high as 8 Mbps. ADSL2+ expands the downlink bandwidth to 2.2 MHz and provides a maximum downlink rate of 24 Mbps. VDSL2 uses a spectrum of up to 30 MHz on the downlink, and provides an uplink-downlink symmetrical rate of 100 Mbps.<br>
As the frequency band in xDSL technology increases, however, crosstalk becomes a nuisance, especially in a high frequency band. There are near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk (FEXT), as shown in Error! Reference source not found, and Error! Reference source not found.. NEXT does no significant harm to system performance while FEXT has a severe impact on line transmission.<br>
For example, when xDSL services are activated for multiple subscribers in a bundle of cables, some lines may suffer from low transmission rate and instability or even xDSL services fail to be activated because of FEXT, leading to a low activation rate of the digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM).<br>
Some operators have worked out their specifications on the management of spectrum applications to avoid crosstalk between devices in various locations. The technologies and methods currently used to address crosstalk issues include multi-subscriber detection technology, maximum likelihood multi-subscriber detection technology, and interference cancellation multi-subscriber detection technology.<br>
The current technologies, however, are complicated and require a large amount of calculation. In addition, the technologies only optimize the performance of DSL lines or<br><br><br>
the system based on some statistic characteristics of crosstalk instead of providing quantitative crosstalk tests on multiple lines. As a result, the transmission performance of DSL lines cannot be optimized significantly.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention discloses a method, apparatus, and system for crosstalk test on multi-subscriber communication lines so that crosstalk between multiple lines can be tested quantitatively to facilitate optimization of DSL line performance or system performance.<br>

The step of determining the quantitative value of crosstalk by a certain line on the line under test includes:<br>
despreading the crosstalk vector information of the tone or line by the corresponding orthogonal spread spectrum codes; and<br>
obtaining the quantitative value of the crosstalk from the certain line to the line under test or on the tone of the line under test according to the despreading result.<br><br>
The despreading result is    	, where L stands for the length of the<br>
orthogonal  spread  spectrum  codes,     '   for  the  orthogonal   spread  spectrum  code corresponding to line i and D(a+jb) for the crosstalk vector information.<br>
The step of obtaining the quantitative value of the crosstalk from the certain line to the line under test or to the tone of the line under test includes:<br>
performing a MOD operation on the despreading result to obtain a quantitative value, and determining whether the value exceeds the preset threshold; if determining that the value exceeds the preset threshold, taking the value as the quantitative value of crosstalk from the certain line to the line under test; otherwise, determining that there is no crosstalk impact by the certain line on the line under test.<br><br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, when crosstalk test is performed on multiple tones of the line, the step of obtaining the quantitative value of the crosstalk from the certain line to the line under test or on the tones of the line under test also includes:<br>
determining the despreading result on the next tone of the line under test, calculating and determining the quantitative value of the crosstalk from the certain line to the line under test until the despreading results of all tones of the line under test are obtained, and obtaining the crosstalk test results.<br>
The method also includes:<br>
obtaining the phase angle of the crosstalk signals on the line under test based on the despreading results and determining the phase characteristics based on the initial phase angle of the line under test.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The main objectives of the present invention are to detect a crosstalk source and quantify a crosstalk. If crosstalk can be tested in real time on DSL devices, the DSL devices may respond to crosstalk in real time and thus avoid crosstalk between multi-subscriber DSL lines and provide data on crosstalk for optimizing the performance of DSLAM devices.<br><br><br>
In practice, xDSL lines in the same bundle of cables may have crosstalk impacts on each other. The core idea of the present invention is to implement crosstalk test between multiple xDSL line pairs as well as crosstalk source identification and crosstalk quantification by code division.<br>
The method provided in an embodiment of the present invention is hereinafter described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In Error! Reference source not found., 0 i, j (n) indicates the crosstalk from line j<br><br>
to the n-th tone of line i. The total crosstalk energy on the nth tone of line i is   	<br>
where Æ i j (n) = 0 (i =j) and M is the number of lines.<br>
Usually, the total crosstalk energy may be measured roughly in the silence period during line initialization. The total crosstalk energy on each tone can be used for estimating the performance of the line but not adaptable for the overall line optimization, which requires to depend on the crosstalk between every two lines in the system. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the crosstalk between every two lines in the system, that is, the 0 j j (n) for each line in the system, where both i and j range from 1 to M.<br>
All other lines may have crosstalk impacts on a certain line at the same time. As shown in Error! Reference source not found., line 1 to line j have crosstalk impacts on line i. The problem is how to identify separately the crosstalk from different lines to line i at the same time and how to identify a specific line that has an impact of crosstalk on line i.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, labels are used for determining the crosstalk of every two lines in the system. In this way, the overall crosstalk signals can be derived from the sum of the crosstalk from each line and thus the crosstalk from each line to line i can be determined.<br>
Error! Reference source not found, shows the flow of realizing the method provided in an embodiment of the invention. The flow includes the following steps:<br><br><br>
Step 41: Label the interfaces of the lines according to a certain sequence or rule so that different lines can be identified.<br>
For example, label the lines from 1 to i and j. Other methods may also be adopted to label the lines. After the lines are labeled for identification, the crosstalk from each line can be calculated separately in subsequent steps.<br>
Step 42: Map labels to a group of orthogonal spread spectrum codes to establish one-to-one correspondence where length of orthogonal spread spectrum codes is L, and save the mapping to a mapping table., as shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 Mapping between labels and orthogonal spread spectrum codes<br><br>
Line Label	1	2	3	...	n<br>
Orthogonal Code	Orthogonal Code bl	Orthogonal Code b2	Orthogonal Code b3	...	Orthogonal Code bn<br>
Crosstalk test can then be performed by loading relevant orthogonal spread spectrum codes on different test channels (i.e. test lines identified by labels).<br>
Step 43: Error! Reference source not found, shows the loading of orthogonal spread spectrum codes on a certain tone of test channels shown in Error! Reference source not found.. Specifically , on the certain tone of one of the test channels, one bit of orthogonal spread spectrum code corresponding to the test channel is loaded into each symbol and L symbols is continuously loaded with bits of the orthogonal spread spectrum code, where L is the length of the orthogonal spread spectrum code.;<br>
Or on the certain tone of one of the test channels, k bits of orthogonal spread spectrum code corresponding t to the test channel are loaded into each symbol, and L/k symbols are continuously loaded with bits of the orthogonal spread spectrum code, where L/k indicates the number L divided by k. To ensure the realization of the method, L/k should be an integer.<br><br><br>
For example, to detect the crosstalk from line 1 in Error! Reference source not found., this step of loading orthogonal spread spectrum codes is implemented on line 1.<br>
The code loaded to line 1 is the orthogonal code bl corresponding to line 1 in Table 1.<br>
As shown in Error! Reference source not found., the bits of spread spectrum code word are loaded into a symbol on respective tones , and at receiving side the despreading is performed for a symbol. The despreading result can reflect whether there are impacts of crosstalk and the severity of the crosstalk on the line under test, but not reflect whether there are impacts of crosstalk on a certain tone and the severity of the crosstalk on the certain tone at the receiving side . This method is simple and saves time, thus playing an important role in qualitative analysis.<br>
Step 44: Obtain the received signal vector containing crosstalk information by FFT and determine the crosstalk vector in the customer premises equipment (CPE) connected to the channel under test.<br>
The transmit vector Y of the channel under test is stretched and rotated to X under the impact of the crosstalk and noises from other lines. The channel under test can be any one of line 2 to line i and line j.<br>
As shown in Error! Reference source not found., the crosstalk vector D(a+jb), which includes crosstalk from other lines to the line under test, is the difference between the signal vectors X and Y.<br>
Calculate the received signal vector, and determine the crosstalk vector according to the received signal vector and the expected received signal vector at the receiving side.<br>
Step 45: Despread the crosstalk vector D(a+jb) with the orthogonal codes corresponding to each line according to the mapping table in step 42.<br>
The despreading of a crosstalk vector is shown in Error! Reference source not found.. The formula is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
 	, where, L stands for the length of orthogonal spread spectrum codes<br>
and bi for orthogonal spread spectrum code in Table 1, i.e orthogonal code.<br>
Step 46: Perform a MOD operation on the despreading result (a complex number).<br>
Step 47: Judge whether the MOD operation result exceeds the preset threshold. If yes, execute step 48; otherwise, execute step 49.<br>
Step 48: Determine that a certain test channel has an impact of crosstalk on the channel under test, take the MOD operation result as the relative quantitative value of the crosstalk and execute step 49.<br>
That is, judge whether a certain test channel has an impact of crosstalk according to the despreading result, and determine the quantitative value of the crosstalk from the certain test channel to the channel under the test according to the MOD operation result and the line label corresponding to the orthogonal spread spectrum code in the calculation.<br>
For example, if the despreading result in step 45 is obtained based on the orthogonal code b2 of line 2 and the result exceeds the preset threshold, then line 2 has an impact of crosstalk on line under test where the crosstalk occurs on the tone loaded in step 43 and the MOD operation result calculated based on the despreading result may be taken as the relative quantitative value of the crosstalk.<br>
In the method provided in an embodiment of the invention, the despreading result in step 45 may also be used to calculate the phase characteristic of the crosstalk. For example, if the result in step 45 is a+jb, the phase angle of crosstalk signals on the line under test can be worked out using the formula Æ1 = arctag (b/a). The initial phase angle of the line under test (or the channel under test), Æ0, is known and therefore, the phase change of the crosstalk is Æ1- Æ0, that is, the phase characteristic.<br>
Step 49: Judge whether the crosstalk on all tones of the line is quantified. If not, execute step 43; otherwise, end this test with the quantitative value of the crosstalk and the phase characteristic.<br><br><br>
It must be noted that as shown in Error! Reference source not found., the crosstalk on all tones and their quantitative value may be obtained at one time by transmitting orthogonal spread spectrum codes on each tone at the same time in step 43.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, crosstalk test may be performed on any line in multiple communication lines. For example, three communication lines have crosstalk impacts on a certain line, and as shown in Error! Reference source not found., the three curves record the result of the crosstalk test on the three lines.<br>
An embodiment of the invention also provides a system for crosstalk test on multi-subscriber communication lines, as shown in Error! Reference source not found.. The system includes a transmitting apparatus and a receiving apparatus. The transmitting apparatus sends test signals, and the receiving apparatus receives test signals and calculates the quantitative value of the crosstalk.<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, a crosstalk source can be identified and crosstalk can be quantified. The realization of an embodiment does not impact the transmission performance of the lines, hence no interference with operating lines and devices. The test result shows how many lines have a significant impact on the line under test and reflects the severity of the impact, providing a powerful basis for dynamic spectrum management.<br>

Abstract <br>
Method, Apparatus and System for Crosstalk Test on Multi-subscriber Communication Lines<br>
A method, apparatus, and system for crosstalk test on multi-subscriber communication lines. The core of the invention is: loading a group of orthogonal spread spectrum codes to the transmitting side of each line, and testing the crosstalk of xSDL lines based on the received signal vector at the receiving side so that the source, amplitude, and phase of the crosstalk can be identified. With the invention, crosstalk test can be implemented in real time on xSDL lines without impacting the transmission performance of other lines. In addition, the test result shows how many lines have a significant impact on the line under test and reflects the severity of the impact, providing a powerful basis for dynamic spectrum management, and optimization of DSLAM system performance.<br><br></td>
