The present Invention relates to a system for transferring fluids, electricity, or an optical signal between two bodies between which there is relative movement More specifically. It relates to a system which makes it possible to transfer, between a vessel and petroleum wells or manifolds or pipelines located on the seabed or a second vessel, hydrocarbons and utilities whose origin or destination Is a vessel or a platform. PRIOR ART<br>
One form of system used to discharge offshore petroleum production does so via a vessel which Is anchored at a single point but has the obllity to turn around It This vessel, generalli a ship, receives the petroleum via submerged lines which run to It. Alter passing through the processing plant, the petroleum Is then stored In tanks on board the vessel until such time as It Is transferred to a collection point which may for example, be a petroleum carrier which will transport It to land. The discharge of the petroleum to the vessel is one of the critical points in this operation since. If the vessel can turn about a point. It Is necessary to have a mechanical device which prevents the submerged lines from twisting excessively.<br>
Two alternatives have teen used to adileve this transfer without twisting. One of them consists of a group of rotary Joints, split In two, whidi are stacked vertically one upon the other and permit a fluid, electricity, or an optical signal to pass through each of them In one direction or the other. The rotary joints for fluid have packing rings between the two parts whlch are able to rotate with respect to each other, for maintaining permanent contact This type of rotary joint Is known by specialists as a 'swivel'. This alternative has the major advantage of making It possible for the vessel to be able to turn freely about the anchoring point without affecting production. However, It does have the drawback of requiring the use of dynamic seals, which always present a risk of leakage.<br>
A further alternative consists of a system formed basically of a horizontal reel on which flexible lines are wound, these being connected at one end to the lines fixed to the vessel and at the other end to the lines whldi run via the central part of the reel and originate from the anchoring tower. The flexible lines on the reel are aligned vertically one upon the other Inside an articulated stivcture which is unwound or rewound as the vessel turns. In one direction or the other, about the anchoring point This system has the advantage of avoiding the use of dynamic seals, but It Imposes a serious restriction on the vessel's ability to turn, which Is,<br><br>
generally speaking, limited to ±270 °.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a novel solution to die problem of transferring products and utilities, and consists of a refinement of the reel altemotive. Incorporating Into it die advantage of unlimited turning abiiltf offered by die stacked swivel system, and also other features which make the invention highly attractive. The object of die present invention is to provide a system which can be used to transfer flulck and utilities between a vessel and the seabed or to anodier vessel or a platform.<br>
This object Is achieved by a transfer system for products and utilities, comprising a structure In the form of a multiple reel with a cylindrical central opening, and at least two groups of flexible lines supported by articulated structures and wound around the multiple reel, each said group occupying one of the reels; wherein each group of flexible lines is interconnected at one of its ends to a wall located In the central region of the multiple reel, where die terminals of the rigid lines and cables which are extensions of the production and utility lines are located; wherein at its other end, each group of flexible lines Is connected to a respective one of a set of circumferentially spaced connection blocks whidi are able to move along rails; and wherein the said groups of flexible lines provide different flow paths. In parallel, from the production and utility lines to the connection blocks.<br>
ft system of this type is formed basically by a multiple reel fixed horizontally on top of a cyllrH±lcal andiorlng tower Interconnected to the vessel and by groups of flexible lines wound on each of the reels. €ach group of flexible lines runs inside an articulated structure uAilch supports the lines Individually and reduces the forces whldi act on them as a result of movement of the lines on the multiple reel as the vessel turns about the axis of the cylindrical anchoring tower, coincident with the axis of the multiple reel.<br>
€adi group of lines Is held at one end on a connexion blodi which can move on rails arranged as a circular track at the periphery of the multiple reel. When a connection block Is coupled to a connection plate held on a connection tower. It Is forced to follow the circular movement of the plate which moves together with the vessel.<br>
The cylindrical anchoring tower has rotational freedom of movement with respect to the vessel. These groups of flexible lines are redundant and may be<br><br>
connected to connection plates, on at least one connection touier fixed to tiie vessel, via connection blocks mounted on rails, ujhldh gives the group total freedom of rotation.<br>
UJhen the blodf Is uncoupled from die plate It can then, through the action of a motor Installed In It, move together u/lth the group of flexible lines for ujhich It serves as the terminal, until these lines are repositioned In a more suitable configuration. The coupling between the block and the plate In front of It can then be made.<br>
UJhen this has been done, action mai be carried put on the valves which tranter production How and the flow of utilities to the group of recently connected lines, andtfien the other connection block can be uncoupled. The connection blocks, the plates, and the connection towers have valves and facilities whid) permit the operations of connecting, disconnecting and testing the seal of the connections. <br>
The Invention will now be desalbed in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which are given purely by way of illustration, and in whldi:<br>
Figure 1 Is a side elevational view of a floating vessel for the offshore production, storage and discharge of petroleum, ard which uses the transfer system of the present Invention;<br>
Figure 2 Is a more detailed side elevation of the same system, showing the cylindrical anchoring tower and, above it, the transfer system with a double reel and two connection towers;<br>
Figure 5 is a top plan view showing the transfer system with one of the groups of flexible lines with Its associated connection block in the Intermediate position on the track and the other group In the uncoupled and stationary state;<br>
Figure 4 shows the vessel, after a turn of almost 220° clockwise with respect to the position shown in Figure 3, where the group of lines shown disconnected In Figure 3 Is now shown connected, and the group of lines which Is connected In Figure 3 Is now shown disconnected. <br>
Figure 1 shows a vessel (1) with the system (2) in accordance with the present invention for transferring products and utilities. In this embodiment, the transfer system Is shown located at the bows of a ship, flithough this is a satisfactory location It should not be regarded as a limitation on the use of the system of the present Invention, since this may be used at any location on a vessel.<br>
Figure 1 also shows andioring lines (3) and the production and utility lines<br><br>
(4) uihich are interconnected to the transfer sistem (2). fluids, eiectriciti, and optical signals are able to pass through the production and utility/ lines (4). The interconnection between the flexible production and utility lines (4) and the transfer Si/stem (2) is achieved by means of rigid lines which, for the sake of simplification and also t&gt;ecause they do not form part of die present invention, are notshoiun in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 2 loujs the transfer system (2) in greater detail. It is possible to see the multiple reel (5), uich. In die present preferred embodiment. Is a double reel.<br>
The multiple reel (5) is fixed directly to and coaxially on die cylindrical anchoring totjuer (6). h Figure 2 this Imaginary axis Is represented by the line (T2). The multiple reel (5) has a cylindrical opening (7) In Its central part. Depending on die diameters of die transfer system (2) and of the anchoring tou/er (6) it is possible to carry out through this opening appropriate operations, involving underujat&amp;- equipment. The cylindrical anchoring tower (6) has total rotational freedom of movement with respect to die vessel.<br>
Groups of flexible lines run inside articulated structures (8, 9) which ore similar in nature to bicycle chains. In addition to supporting the groups of flexible lines, these structures reduce the loads acting on them as a result of the turning of the vessel. The two groups of flexible lines can be wound on or unwound from the multiple reel (5), depending on the relative rotational movements between the vessel and die cylindrical anchoring tower (6).<br>
The groups of flexible lines supported by the structures (8, 9) are each ccmected at one of its ends to the cylindrical wall (20) located In the central region of the multiple reel (5) where the ends of the rigid lines and the terminals which Interconnect to the flexible production and utility lines (4) are located.<br>
fit the other end, each group of flexible lines Is connected to the respective connection block (TO, 7 T) which runs on rails (T9). These rails are arranged In circles uhose axis of symmetry coincides with the vertical axis (T2), thus keeping the path of movement of eadi connection block (TO, 7 T) constantly circular and at the same distance flam the vertical axis (T2).<br>
The connection blocks (TO, 7 T) may be connected to connection plates on connection towers (T3, T4) fixed directly to the vessel and integral with it In die present embodiment, in order to extend the rotational path of the transfer system of the invention, there are two connection towers (T3, T4) cmynged in diametrically opposed positions, as shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4. It is, however, possible to use any other number of connection towers, depending on the peculiarities of each<br><br>
situation.<br>
fis the groups oF flexible lines sufpoited b the articulated structures (6, 9) are wound on the multiple reel (5) at different levels, the first being above the second, in this case with the first at the top and the second at the bottom, the connection tou/ers (13, 14) have connection plates located at different levels so as to make it possible to achieve perfect coupling of the connection towers (13, 14) to the connection blocks (10, 11).<br>
In this way, in the present embodiment, the connection block (10) can be ccHJplto the connection tower (13) by means oftiye connection plate (15), or to the connection tower (14) by means of the connection plate (17). Filso the connection block (11) may be coupled to the connection tower (13) by means of the connection plate (16), or to the connection tower (14) by means of the connection plate (16).<br>
fill the cofviectlon blocks and plates are designed so as to guarantee that, uhen the couplings are made, the flows In the flexible production and utility lines (4) are correctiy conveyed to the Intended points by the flexible lines supported by the articulatedstructires (8, 9), In other words. It must, for example, be guaranteed that the flow of oil originating from an underwater well or from an underwater manifold Is correctly conveyed to the primary processing plant<br>
The connections effected by the groups of flexible lines linked to the connection blocks (10, 11) are redundant It Is therefore possible, while the vessel Is making cmgular movements about the axis of the multiple reel (5), to reposition one group of flexible lines while the other group Is disconnected, without adversely affecting production or other essential functions.<br>
Figure 3 shows a top plan view of the transfer system (2) of the present Invention. The artlojlated structures (8, 9) whldi support the groups of flexible lines are In different positions. €ach connection block (10, 11) can be coupled to any one of the connection towers (13, 14), depending on what Is appropriate at the time the connection Is made.<br>
The connection plates (15, 16, 17, 18) of the towers (13, 14) may be actuated remotely, to move radially toward the multiple reel, so as to permit their connection to the ccvmectlon block (10, 11) with which they are associated. When clamping has been carried out, the seal at the connections of the lines where the oil and gas flow may be tested using procedures In general use In the petroleum Industry.<br>
fifter carrying out these tests, the production flow and utilities can 60<br><br>
switched over in order to pass througfi the recently made connections. It is then possible to proceed ujitii uncoupling the connection block which was hitherto connected, with the aim oF giving the transfer system a larger rotational path. However, before camming out this uncoupling, it is necessary/ to drain the fluids retained between the lut-off valves (notshou), thereby/preventing leakage into the environment ckring disconnection. These ckainage procedures are not described here because they will be familiar to specialists and also because they are not Included within the scope of the invention.<br>
The ability of the connection blocks (10, 11) to move on the rails (19) makes It possible to carry out the actions necessary for coupling the connection blocks (10, 11) to the connection plates (15, 16, 17, 16). In the present embodi¬ment, a motor Is Installed In the blocks to provide the necessary medianlcal power to move them over the rails (19); this may, for example, be a hydraulic or electric motor.<br>
The connection blocks (10, 11), the corviectlon plates (15, 16, 17, 18), and the connection towers (13, 14) have valves whldi permit the operations of connecting, disconnecting and testing the seal of the connections.<br>
The use of groups of flexible lines Interconnected to connection blocks and connectlon towers with multiple connection plates gives the transfer system of the present Invention great flexibility, since It ensures that, at any moment, there will always be at least one connection In operation, regardless of the position of the vessel.<br><br><br><br>
