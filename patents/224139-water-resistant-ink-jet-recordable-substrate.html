				<td>WATER RESISTANT INK JET RECORDABLE SUBSTRATE<br>
This patent applications claims priority to provisional patent application<br>
having Serial Number 60/373,957 filed on April 19, 2002.<br>
The present invention is directed to an ink jet recordable substrate. In<br>
particular, the present invention relates to a water-resistant coating composition<br>
for an ink jet recordable substrate, a method for preparing the coating<br>
composition and a method of applying said coating composition to produce a<br>
water-resistant ink jet recordable substrate.<br>
It is known in the art to employ various paper treatment methods to<br>
improve the quality of ink jet prints thereon. However, problems have been<br>
experienced when the imaged-sheet comes into contact with water; the image<br>
may migrate through the sheet to the other side. In some instances, the show-<br>
through of the image on the back side of the paper has more ink than the front<br>
side. Further, paper treatment methods which improve inter-color bleed<br>
problems in color ink jet images may heighten the severity of show-through of<br>
the image.<br>
It is also known in the art to size cellulosic-based paper with sizing<br>
components for the purpose of reducing the penetration of liquids into the<br>
substrate. "Internal sizing" may include the introduction of a material into the pulp<br>
during the paper making operation. "Surface sizing" may include the application<br>
of dispersions of film-forming substances such as converted starches, gums, and<br>
modified polymers to previously formed paper. When used to print with an ink jet<br>
printer containing predominantly water based inks, internal and surface sized<br>
papers often yield imaged papers which curl into tubes.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to develop an ink jet recordable substrate that<br>
does not exhibit the aforementioned problems.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,709,976 discloses a method for coating a paper<br>
substrate with a hydrophobic barrier layer and an image- receiving layer. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,140,412 discloses a method for coating paper with an aqueous<br>
cationic polyurethane resin solution.<br>
In addition to paper printing substrates, polyolefin based printing<br>
substrates in the form of a microporous material sheet were developed and are<br>
known in the art. For example, U.S. Patents 4,861,644 and 5,196,262 disclose<br>
microporous material sheets which include a matrix of linear ultrahigh molecular<br>
weight polyolefin, a large proportion of finely divided water-insoluble siliceous<br>
filler, and interconnecting pores. However, inks used for inkjet printing may<br>
coalesce on the surface of the polyolefin based printing substrates.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6025,068 discloses a method for coating a microporous<br>
polyolefin substrate with a composition including a binder dissolved or dispersed<br>
in a volatile aqueous liquid medium. The binder includes a film-forming organic<br>
polymer of a water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) and a water-soluble or water-<br>
dispersible crosslinkable urethane-acrylate hybrid polymer. However, ink jet<br>
recordings on these coated substrates lack the sharpness and vibrancy which is<br>
desired.<br>
Japanese Patent (JP) 2001-184881 discloses a coating composition that<br>
includes a nonionic or anionic polyurethane and the reaction product of a<br>
monomeric secondary amine and epichlorohydrin. However, when subsequently<br>
contacted with water, the monomeric amine adduct can solubilize, which may<br>
result in a blurred image.<br>
Further, United States Patent 6,020,058 discloses an acrylic composition<br>
and United States Patent 6,025,068 discloses a urethane-acrylic co-polymer.<br>
These patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Moreover, patent application having U.S. Serial No. 60/309,348 filed<br>
August 1, 2001, discloses a two-component water-resistant coating composition<br>
for use with a microporous substrate; and patent application having U.S. Serial<br>
No. 60/317,113 filed September 5, 2001, discloses a method of processing a<br>
coated microporous substrate. Both of these patent applications are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Thus, there is a need in the art for an ink jet recordable substrate that is<br>
durable, water resistant and able to record share images when an ink jet printing<br>
ink is applied thereto.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a water-resistant coating composition<br>
for ink jet recordable substrates. The water-resistant coating composition<br>
includes:<br>
(a) an aqueous polyurethane dispersion;<br>
(b) an aqueous solution of a cationic nitrogen-containing<br>
polymeric dye fixative compound; and<br>
(c) an acrylic polymer,<br>
wherein the coating composition has a pH of 7 or less.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method of coating an ink jet<br>
recordable substrate in which an ink jet recordable substrate is provided and the<br>
above-defined coating composition is applied to the substrate.<br>
The present invention is further directed to an ink jet recordable substrate<br>
which includes a substrate having at least one side, and to at least one side of<br>
the substrate is applied a coating layer of the above described coating<br>
composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to<br>
quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, etc. used herein are to be<br>
understood as modified in all instances by the term "about."<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to (meth)acrylic, (meth)acrylate<br>
and (meth)acrylamide monomers is meant to include both the methacrylic and<br>
acrylic species.<br>
Any polyurethane that may be dispersible in water is suitable for use in<br>
the present coating composition. Such polyurethanes include anionic, cationic<br>
and nonionic polyurethanes. The co-mixing of anionic polymers and cationic<br>
polymers often produces a polysalt which is typically insoluble in water and other<br>
solvents. In the present invention, it has been discovered that an anionic<br>
polyurethane dispersion may be combined with a cationic nitrogen-containing<br>
polymer to form a stable aqueous dispersion which can be useful as a coating<br>
composition for an ink jet recordable substrate.<br>
An aqueous dispersion of polyurethane resin comprising particles of a<br>
polyurethane polymer dispersed in an aqueous medium can be used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
The poiyurethane for use in the present invention can be prepared by a<br>
variety of methods known in the art. For example, a polyisocyanate can be<br>
reacted with a polyol to form a prepofymer, such as an isocyanate-terminated<br>
prepolymer. As used herein and the claims, the term "polyisocyanate" refers to a<br>
compound with more than one isocyanate group, such as a diisocyanate. Non-<br>
limiting examples of suitable diisocyanates for use in the present invention<br>
include toluene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone<br>
diisocyanate and dicyclohexyl methane diisocyanate. Non-limiting examples of<br>
suitable three or more functional isocyanates include the reaction products of<br>
diisocyanates with polyols such as trimethylol propane, glycerol and<br>
pentaerythritol. A suitable polyisocyanate for use in the present invention can<br>
include but is not limited to Desmodur which is commercially available from<br>
Bayer.<br>
As used herein and in the claims, the term "poiyol" refers to a compound<br>
with more than one hydroxyl group. Non-limiting examples of suitable polyols for<br>
use in the present invention include polyols such as those from which the<br>
polyisocyanate can be prepared, polyester polyols and polyether polyols.<br>
The reaction of the polyisocyanate and polyol can be carried out in the<br>
presence of an organic solvent. Suitable solvents can include but are not limited<br>
to n-methyl pyrrolidone, tetrahydrofuran or glycol ether.<br>
In an embodiment, the prepolymer can be reacted with a di-hydroxyt<br>
compound having an acid group, such as dimethylol propionic acid, to produce a<br>
polyurethane with at least one pendant acid group. The acid group can include a<br>
carboxylic acid group or a sulfonic acid group. The polyurethane having a<br>
pendant acid group can then be reacted with a base to produce an anionic<br>
polyurethane. The anionic poiyurethane dispersions of the present invention<br>
generally can be dispersed in a base which ionizes the acidic groups of the<br>
polymer and stabilizes the dispersion. The base can be selected from the group<br>
consisting of an inorganic base, ammonia, amine and mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable anionic polyurethanes for use in the<br>
present invention can include anionic polyurethanes based on aromatic<br>
polyether polyurethanes, aliphatic polyether polyurethanes, aromatic polyester<br>
polyurethanes, aliphatic polyester polyurethanes, aromatic polycaprolactam<br>
polyurethanes, and/or aliphatic polycaprolactam polyurethanes. Examples of<br>
suitable anionic polyurethane dispersions that can be used in the present<br>
invention can include but are not limited to those marketed under the trade name<br>
WitcoBond® which are commercially available from Crompton Corporation,<br>
Greenwich, Connecticut.<br>
A cationic polyurethane dispersion for use in the present invention can be<br>
prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. For example, United States<br>
Patent 3,470,310 discloses a method which includes the preparation of water<br>
dispersions of polyurethanes which contain salt-type groups bonded into the<br>
polyurethane. United States Patent 3,873,484 discloses aqueous dispersions of<br>
polyurethanes prepared from a quaternized polyurethane prepolymer. United<br>
States Patent 6,221,954 discloses a method for preparing a polyurethane<br>
prepolymer in which a N-monoalkanol tertiary amine is reacted with an alkylene<br>
oxide in the presence of a strong acid. The relevant portions of these patents<br>
are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In an embodiment, the prepolymer can be reacted with a di-hydroxyl<br>
compound having an amine group, such as a secondary or tertiary amine, to<br>
produce a polyurethane with at least one pendant amine group. Non-limiting<br>
examples of a di-hydroxyl compound having an amine group can include<br>
polyamines such as ethylene diamine, isophorone diamine and diethylene<br>
triamine. The polyurethane having a pendant amine group can then be reacted<br>
with an acid to produce a cationic polyurethane.<br>
Suitable cationic polyurethanes for use in the present invention can<br>
include but is not limited to those marketed under the trade name WitcoBond<br>
(i.e., W213, W215 and X051) which are available from Crompton Corporation,<br>
Greenwich, Connecticut.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the prepolymer can be<br>
reacted with a diol having a polyalkylene oxide chain, to produce a polyurethane<br>
backbone with a polyalkylene glycol pendant chain. The polyurethane having a<br>
polyalkylene glycol pendant chain can be reduced with water to produce a<br>
nonionic polyurethane.<br>
Suitable nonionic polyurethanes for use in the present invention can<br>
include but is not limited to those marketed under the trade name WitcoBond<br>
(i.e., W320) which are available from Crompton Corporation, Greenwich,<br>
Connecticut.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, a vinyl or ethylenic unsaturated isocyanate<br>
prepolymer or vinyl or ethylenic unsaturated polyurethane can be reacted with a<br>
vinyl or ethylenic unsaturated acid species, such as acrylic acid or methacrylic<br>
acid, in a free radical synthesis to form a carboxylic acid pendant polyurethane.<br>
The acid pendant polyurethane can be reacted with a base, such as those<br>
aforementioned, to form an anionic polyurethane.<br>
Further, the prepolymer can be dispersed in water in the presence of a<br>
base and then chain extended by adding a polyamine. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the prepolymer can be chain-extended in an organic solvent<br>
solution and the resulting polyurethane polymer can be dispersed in water in the<br>
presence of a base.<br>
In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the aqueous polyurethane<br>
dispersion can contain up to 70 wt.%, or up to 65 wt.%, or up to 60 wt.%, or up to<br>
50 wt.% of the polyurethane. The aqueous polyurethane dispersion can include<br>
at least 1 wt.%, or at least 5 wt.%, or at least 10 wt.%, or at least 20 wt.%<br>
polyurethane. The amount of polyurethane in the aqueous polyurethane<br>
dispersion can vary widely. However, the amount should not be so high as to<br>
cause the dispersion itself or the mixture with the nitrogen-containing polymer to<br>
be unstable; and the amount should not be so low that the coating composition<br>
does not provide sufficient water and rub resistance or that the dispersion itself<br>
becomes unstable. The polyurethane can be present in the aqueous<br>
polyurethane dispersion in any range of values inclusive of those stated above.<br>
In addition to an aqueous polyurethane dispersion, a coating composition<br>
of the present invention, includes an aqueous solution of a cationic nitrogen-<br>
containing polymeric dye fixative compound. In a non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
aqueous solution of a cationic nitrogen-containing polymer suitable for use in the<br>
present invention can have a pH of 7 or less, or a pH of 6 or less, or 5 or less, to<br>
ensure that at least a portion of the nitrogen atoms carry at least a portion of a<br>
cationic charge. In a further non-limiting embodiment, the coating composition of<br>
the present invention can also have a pH 7 or less, or 6 or less, or 5 or less.<br>
Any nitrogen-containing polymer in which at least a portion of the nitrogen<br>
atoms carry at least a portion of a cationic charge at a pH within the<br>
aforementioned range can be useful in the present invention. Non-limiting<br>
examples of suitable cationic nitrogen-containing polymers for use as a dye<br>
fixative include but are not limited to polymers that include one or more monomer<br>
residues derived from one or more of the following nitrogen-containing<br>
monomers:<br><br>
where R1 represents independently for each occurrence H or C1 to C3 aliphatic;<br>
R2 represents independently for each occurrence a divalent linking group<br>
selected from C2 to C2o aliphatic hydrocarbon, polyethylene glycol and<br>
polypropylene glycol; R3 represents independently for each occurrence H, C1 to<br>
C22 aliphatic hydrocarbon or a residue from the reaction of the nitrogen with<br>
epichlorohydrin; Z is selected from -O- or-NR4-, wherein R4 represents H or<br>
CH3; and X represents a halide or methylsulfate.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic nitrogen-containing monomers<br>
for use in the present invention can include but are not limited to dimethyl<br>
aminoethyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium halides,<br>
(meth)acryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate, dimethyl aminopropyl<br>
(meth)acrylamide, (meth)acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
halides,(meth)acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate, diallyl amine,<br>
methyl diallyl amine, and diallyl dimethyl ammonium halides.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the cationic nitrogen-containing polymers<br>
can contain one or more additional monomer residues. An additional monomer<br>
residue can be selected from any polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer that when copolymerized with a nitrogen-containing monomer, can<br>
result in a polymer that is at least partially soluble in water. As used herein and<br>
in the claims, "partially soluble" means at least 0.1 gram of the polymer can be<br>
dissolvable in water when 10 grams of the polymer is added to 1 liter of water<br>
and mixed for 24 hours.<br>
Non-limiting examples of monomers that can be copolymerized with the<br>
nitrogen-containing monomers include but are not limited to (meth)acrylamide, n-<br>
alkyl (meth)acrylamides, (meth)acrylic acid, alkyl esters of (meth)acrylate, glycol<br>
esters of (meth)acrylic acid, polyethylene glycol esters of (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
hdroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, itaconic acid, alkyl ethers of itaconic acid, maleic<br>
acid, mono- and di-alkyl esters of maleic acid, maleic anhydride, maleimide,<br>
aconitic acid, alkyl esters of aconitic acid, allyl alcohol and alkyl ethers of allyl<br>
alcohol.<br>
In a further non-limiting embodiment, a nitrogen-containing polymer for<br>
use in the present invention, can be a homopolymer of a nitrogen-containing<br>
monomer or it can be a copolymer of one or more nitrogen-containing<br>
monomers. A nitrogen-containing polymer can also be a copolymer of one or<br>
more polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers, or one or more<br>
nitrogen-containing monomers, or mixtures thereof. In alternate non-limiting<br>
embodiments, when a nitrogen-containing polymer includes one or more other<br>
polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated comonomers, the nitrogen-containing<br>
polymer can include not more than 70 mol%, or not more than 50 mol%, or not<br>
more than 25 mol%, or not more than 10 mol% of the nitrogen-containing<br>
monomer. The amount of nitrogen-containing monomer used can depend upon<br>
the polyurethane component used in the present coating composition. When the<br>
amount of the nitrogen-containing monomer in the nitrogen-containing polymer is<br>
too high, the resulting mixture of the nitrogen-containing polymer and<br>
polyurethane dispersion can be unstable. The application of an unstable mixture<br>
to an ink jet recordable substrate can be difficult.<br>
When the nitrogen-containing polymer includes one or more other<br>
polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated comonomers, the nitrogen-containing<br>
polymer can include at least 0.1 mol%, or at least 1.0 mol%, or at least 2.5<br>
mol%, or at least 5.0 mol% of the nitrogen-containing monomer. When the<br>
amount of nitrogen-containing monomer in the nitrogen-containing polymer is too<br>
low, the nitrogen-containing polymer may not provide adequate dye fixative<br>
properties and a recorded ink image on the coated substrate can lack the<br>
desired water and rub fastness properties.<br>
A nitrogen-containing monomer may be present in the nitrogen-containing<br>
polymer in any range of values inclusive of those stated above. The one or more<br>
other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers can be present in an<br>
amount sufficient to bring the total percentage to 100 mol%.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, a nitrogen-<br>
containing polymer can comprise an aqueous solution. In this embodiment, the<br>
aqueous solution can include at least 5 wt.%, or at least 10 wt.%, or at least 15<br>
wt.% of the nitrogen-containing polymer and not more than 50 wt.%, or not more<br>
than 45 wt.%, or not more than 40 wt.% of the nitrogen-containing polymer.<br>
When the concentration of the nitrogen-containing polymer is too low it may not<br>
be economical for use in commercial applications and can be too dilute to<br>
provide optimum ratios with the polyurethane component. When the<br>
concentration is too high, the viscosity of the solution can increase and result in<br>
handling difficulties in a commercial environment. In a non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the nitrogen-containing polymer can include a solution of polyamide amines<br>
reacted with epichlorohydrin, available under the trade name CinFix by<br>
Stockhausen GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Krefeld, Germany.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention includes an acrylic<br>
polymer. In a non-limiting embodiment, the acrylic polymer can be selected from<br>
anionic, cationic and nonionic acrylic polymers. In a non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the acrylic polymer can include a cationic acrylic polymer. Non-limiting examples<br>
of suitable cationic acrylic polymers can include polyacrylates,<br>
polymethacrylates, polyacrylonitriles and polymers having monomer types<br>
selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, acrylamide and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The cationic acrylic polymer can be prepared by a variety of methods<br>
known in the art. In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
cationic acrylic polymer can be synthesized via a free radical solution<br>
polymerization from monomer types butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and 2-<br>
(tert-butylamino)ethyl methoacrylate. The molar equivalent of butyl acrylate can<br>
be from 0.10 to 0.95, or from 0.15 to 0.75; the molar equivalent of methyl<br>
methacrylate can be from 0.10 to 0.85, or from 0.15 to 0.70; and the molar<br>
equivalent of 2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methyacrylate can be from 0.10 to 0.25, or<br>
from 0.12 to 0.20. The reaction mixture can be treated with acid such that the pH<br>
is within a range of from 4.0 to 7.0. The mixture then can be diluted with water<br>
and solvent stripped. Non-limiting examples of suitable acids for use in the<br>
treatment step can include any acid which can function as a solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agent to produce a stable dispersion of a cationic polymer. Non-<br>
limiting examples of suitable solvents for use in the stripping process can include<br>
isopropanol and methyisobutyl ketone (MIBK).<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the molar<br>
equivalent of the butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and 2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl<br>
methacrylate, can be 0.219 to 0.621 to 0.160, respectively.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, the cationic acrylic polymer for use in<br>
the present invention can have a number average molecular weight of from 1500<br>
to 8150, or from 2900 to 7125.<br>
The ink jet recordable substrate coating composition of the present<br>
invention includes a mixture of an aqueous solution of a nitrogen-containing<br>
polymer, an aqueous polyurethane dispersion, and an acrylic polymer. In a non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the mixture can include from 20 wt.% to 75 wt.%, or from<br>
25 wt.% to 70 wt.%, or from 30 wt.% to 60 wt.% of the aqueous polyurethane<br>
dispersion. The mixture can also include from 5 wt.% to 75 wt.%, or from 15<br>
wt.% to 70 wt.%, or from 30 wt.% to 65 wt.% of an aqueous solution of the<br>
nitrogen-containing polymer. The mixture can also include from 1 wt.% to 75<br>
wt.%, or from 20 wt.% to 60 wt.%, or from 25 wt.% to 50 wt.% of an acrylic<br>
polymer. The weight percentages are based on the total weight of the ink jet<br>
recordable substrate coating composition<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, water can be<br>
added to the mixture of nitrogen-containing polymer, polyurethane and acrylic<br>
polymer. When water is added to the mixture, the resulting ink recordable<br>
substrate coating composition can have a total resin solids of from 5 wt.% to 35<br>
wt.%, or from 5 wt.% to 20 wt.%, or from 5 wt.% to 15 wt.% based on the total<br>
weight of the ink recordable substrate coating composition. A total resin solids<br>
that is too high, can cause the viscosity of the coating composition to increase<br>
such that the resulting penetration of the coating composition to the substrate<br>
can be less than desired. A total resin solids that is too low, can cause the<br>
viscosity of the coating composition to decrease such that the resulting<br>
penetration of the coating to the substrate can be less than desired. In a non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the viscosity of the coating composition can be less than<br>
500 cps, or less than 400 cps and at least 10 cps, or at least 25 cps when<br>
measured using a Brookfield viscometer at 25°C.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the coating composition of the present<br>
invention can also include other additives typically known in the art. Non-limiting<br>
examples of suitable additives can include surfactants, such as nonionic,<br>
cationic, anionic, amphoteric and zwiterionic surfactants; rheology modifiers,<br>
such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, polyethylene oxides,<br>
polyacrylamides, natural and synthetic gums; biocides, such as a blend of 5-<br>
chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-oneand 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one<br>
available commercially by the trade name Kathon, from Rohm and Haas Co., 2-<br>
hydroxypropylmethane thiosulfonate, and dithiocarbamates; and coupling<br>
agents, such as titanium, silane-type, trisodium pyrophosphate.<br>
The pH of the coating composition of the present invention can be less<br>
than 7, or less than 6, or less than 5. It is believed that when the pH is outside of<br>
these ranges, the cationic polymeric dye fixative compound may not carry a<br>
sufficient cationic charge to perform its intended function. Further, it is believed<br>
that on certain substrates, the wetting action of the coating composition can be<br>
improved when the pH is within the aforementioned ranges. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, for commercial applications, the coating composition can have pH<br>
greater than 2.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method of preparing the ink jet<br>
recordable substrate coating composition of the present invention. In a non-<br>

(b) providing the coating composition described above; and<br>
(c) applying the coating composition to at least one side of the ink<br>
recordable substrate.<br>
Any ink jet recordable substrate known in the art can be used in the<br>
present invention. As a non-limiting example, the substrate can be any cellulosic-<br>

intrinsic viscosity of at least 5 deciliters/gram.<br>
Intrinsic viscosity can be measured using a variety of methods known to<br>
the skilled artisan. As used herein and in the claims, intrinsic viscosity can be<br>

impregnant-free, and pre-bonding basis, pores constitute at least 35 percent by<br>
volume of the microporous material, or at least 60 percent by volume of the<br>
microporous material, or from 35 percent to 80 percent by volume of the<br>
microporous material, or from 60 percent to 75 percent by volume.<br>

selected from a wide variety that are known in the art. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the particulate siliceous filler can be finely divided substantially<br>
water-insoluble siliceous particles. These particles can be in the form of ultimate<br>
particles, aggregates of ultimate particles, or a combination of both. In a non-<br>
limiting embodiment, at least 90 percent by weight of the siliceous particles used<br>
in preparing the microporous material can have gross particle sizes in the range<br>
of from about 5 to about 40 micrometers as determined by use of a Model TAII<br>
Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Inc.) but modified by stirring the filler for 10<br>
minutes in Isoton II electrolyte (Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.) using a four-<br>
blade, 4.445 centimeter diameter propeller stirrer. In a further non-limiting<br>
embodiment, at least 90 percent by weight of the siliceous particles can have<br>
gross particle sizes in the range of from about 10 to about 30 micrometers. It is<br>
expected that the sizes of filler agglomerates can be reduced during processing<br>
of the ingredients to prepare the microporous material.<br>

the present invention can include non-siliceous filler particles. In a further non-<br>
limiting embodiment, finely divided substantially water-insoluble non-siliceous<br>
filler particles can be used. Non-limiting examples of suitable non-siliceous filler<br>

A further description of suitable microporous materials for use in the<br>
present invention is U.S. Patent Nos. 4,861,644 to Young et al. and 5,196,262 to<br>
Schwarz et al., the relevant portions of both are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
A variety of suitable methods can be used to apply the coating<br>
composition to the ink recordable substrate. The coating compositions generally<br>
can be applied to the substrate using any conventional technique known in the<br>
art. Non-limiting examples of suitable methods include spraying, curtain coating,<br>
dipping, rod coating, blade coating, roller application, size press, printing,<br>
brushing, drawing, slot-die coating, and extrusion. In a non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the coating can be dried by exposing the coated substrate to forced air at a<br>
temperature in the range of from ambient to 177°C.<br>
The coating composition can be applied once or a multiplicity of<br>
times. In a non-limiting embodiment, when the coating composition is applied a<br>
multiplicity of times, the applied coating usually can be dried, either partially or<br>
totally, between coating applications. In a further non-limiting embodiment, once<br>
the coating composition has been applied to the substrate, the solvent can be<br>
substantially removed, usually by drying.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, an air knife coating technique wherein<br>
the coating composition is applied to the substrate and the excess is 'blown off'<br>
by a powerful jet from the air knife, can be used. In another embodiment, a<br>
reverse.<br>
roll coating can be used. In this procedure, the coating material can be<br>
measured onto an applicator roller by precision setting of the gap between an<br>
upper metering roller and the application roller below it. The coating can be<br>
'wiped' off the application roller by the substrate as it passes around the support<br>
roller at the bottom.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, gravure coating coating can<br>
be used to apply the coating composition. In the gravure coating method, an<br>
engraved roller can run in a coating bath, which fills the engraved dots or lines of<br>
the roller with the coating composition. Any excess coating on the roller can be<br>
wiped off by a doctor blade and the coating can be deposited onto the substrate<br>
as it passes between the engraved roller and a pressure roller, the coating<br>
composition can be also be used. In this alternate method, the coating<br>
composition can be metered by the engraving on a roller before being wiped off<br>
as in a conventional reverse roll coating process.<br>
In a further non-limiting embodiment, a metering rod can be used to apply the<br>
coating composition. When a metering rod is used, an excess of the coating can<br>
be deposited onto the substrate as it passes over a bath roller. The wirewound<br>
metering rod, known as a Meyer Bar, allows the desire quantity of the coating to<br>
remain on the substrate. The quantity can be determined by the diameter of the<br>
wire used on the rod.<br>
The thickness of the substantially dry coating can vary widely. In alternate non-<br>
limiting embodiments, the thickness of the coating can be in the range of from 1<br>
to 40 urn, or from 5 to 25 urn .<br>
The present invention is also directed to a coated microporous material<br>
substrate. In a non-living enbodiment, the coated microporous substrate can<br>
include the micriporous material substrat having at least one surface described<br>
above and which has a coating layer on at least one surface. The coating layer<br>
can be the dried coating composition of the present invention and can include an<br>
acrylic polymer, a polymeric nitrogen containing dye fixative compound and one<br>
or more polyurethanes as described above.<br>
The amount of the substantially dry coating applied to the substrate, or coat<br>
weight, can be measured as coating weight per coated area. As used<br>
herein and in the claims, "substantially dry" means that the coating layer feels<br>
dry to the touch. The amount of coating can vary widely. In alternate non-<br>
limiting embodiments, the amount of coating can be at least 0.001 gram per<br>
square meter, or at least 0.01 gram per square meter, or at least 0.1 gram per<br>
square meter. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the amount of the coating<br>
can be 50 gram per square meter or less, or 40 gram per square meter or less,<br>
or 35 gram per square meter or less. The amount of the substantially dry<br>
coating applied to the substrate can vary between any of the afore-specified<br>
amounts.<br>
The water-resistant ink jet recordable substrate of the present invention,<br>
can be polymer processed. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the substrate<br>
can be laminated and/or molded. Lamination can be performed using a variety<br>
of techniques known to one having ordinary skill in the art. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, lamination can include bonding the ink jet recording substrate to at<br>
least one layer of a substantially nonporous material. The water-resistant ink jet<br>
recordable substrate can be bonded together with the substantially nonporous<br>
material in the presence or the absence of an adhesive. As used herein,<br>
"substantially nonporous" materials means those materials which are generally<br>
impervious to the passage of liquids, gases, and bacteria.<br>
Substantially nonporous materials for use in the present invention can<br>

one non-limiting embodiment, the substantially nonporous material for use in the<br>
present invention can be in the form or a sheet, film or foil.<br>

In a non-limiting embodiment, a multilayer article comprising the present<br>
invention can be constructed using a wide variety of known methods for<br>
connecting at least one layer of an ink jet recordable substrate with at least one<br>
layer of a substantially nonporous material. In one non-limiting embodiment, at<br>
least one layer of a substantially water-resistant, at least partially coated ink jet<br>
recordable substrate can be fusion bonded to at least one layer of a substantially<br>
nonporous material. The ink jet recordable substrate generally comprises<br>
opposed major surfaces which are characteristic of sheets, films, foils, and<br>
plates. The resulting multilayer article can comprise one layer or more than one<br>
layer of the ink jet recordable substrate and one layer or more than one layer of<br>
the substantially nonporous material. In a non-limiting embodiment, at least one<br>
exterior layer can be the ink jet recordable substrate. In an alternate non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the ink jet recordable substrate can be a microporous substrate.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, the multilayer article of the present<br>
invention can be produced by fusion bonding in the absence of an adhesive.<br>
Fusion bonding can be accomplished using conventional techniques such as<br>
sealing through use of heated rollers, heated bars, heated plates, heated bands,<br>
heated wires, flame bonding, radio frequency (RF) sealing, and ultrasonic<br>
sealing. Solvent bonding can be used where the substantially nonporous<br>
substrate is at least partially soluble in the applied solvent to the extent that the<br>
substrate is at least partially soluble in the applied solvent to the extant that the<br>
surface becomes tacky. The ink jet recordable substrate can be contacted with<br>
the tacky surface, and the solvent then can be removed to form the fusion bond.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, foamable compositions can be foamed in contact<br>
with the ink jet recordable substrate to form a fusion bond between the foam<br>
and the substrate. Films or sheets to form a fusion bond between the foam and<br>
the substrate. The fusion bond can be permanent or peelable, depending upon<br>
the known bonding technique and/or the nature of the substantially nonporous<br>
substrate employed.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, heat sealing can be used to fusion bond an<br>
ink jet recordable substrate to a substantially nonporous material. In general,<br>
heat sealing includes inserting the ink jet recordable substrate into standard heat<br>
sealing equipment which is known in the art. In one non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the ink jet recordable substrate can be inserted in conjunction with the<br>
substantially nonporous material which can be a thermoplastic and/or thermoset<br>
polymer. Heat and/or pressure can be applied to the substrate/polymer<br>
construction for a period if time. The amount of heat and/or pressure and length<br>
of time can vary widely. In general, the temperature, pressure and time can be<br>
selected such that the substrate and polymer are at least partially connected<br>
together to form a multiplayer article. In a non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
temperature can be within the range of from 38°C-204°C. in another non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the pressure can be within the range of from 0.34-1.7 X105 pas. In<br>
a further non-limiting embodiment, the period of time can be in the range<br>
of from one (1) second to thirty (30) minutes. The multilayer article can then be<br>
cooled while under pressure for a typical period of time, such as thirty (30)<br>
minutes. Although the strength of the bond formed between the substrate and<br>
polymer can vary, in a non-limiting embodiment, the strength can be such that it<br>
generally exceeds the tensile properties of the substrate alone.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, the substantially nonporous substrate<br>
can be polyvinyl chloride.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, the ink jet recordable substrate<br>
employed in the present invention can be at least partially connected to a<br>
nonporous substrate such as polyethylene and polypropylene by heat sealing In<br>
the absence of an extrinsic adhesive. The resultant fusion bond can be<br>
sufficiently strong which is surprising inasmuch as the lamination of materials to<br>
polyolefins can be difficult unless adhesives are used.<br>
In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the ink jet recordable substrate can<br>
be substantially continuously at least partially connected to the substantially<br>
nonporous substrate, or it can be discontinuously at least partially connected to<br>
the substantially nonporous substrate. Non-limiting examples of discontinuous<br>
bonds can include bonding areas in the form of one or more spots, patches,<br>
strips, stripes, chevrons, undulating stripes, zigzag stripes, open-curved stripes,<br>
closed-curved stripes, irregular areas, and the like. In a further non-limiting<br>
embodiment, when patterns of bonds are involved, they can be random,<br>
repetitive, or a combination of both.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, an ink jet recordable substrate can<br>
be connected to a substantially nonporous material in the presence of an<br>
adhesive. The adhesive for use in the present invention can be selected from a<br>
wide variety of adhesives known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable<br>
adhesives include those having a sufficient molecular weight and viscosity such<br>
that the adhesive will not substantially migrate into or substantially penetrate the<br>
ink jet recordable substrate. Migration or penetration of the adhesive into the<br>
substrate can reduce the tack and bond strength of the adhesive. Non-limiting<br>
examples of suitable adhesives for use in the present invention can include but<br>
are not limited to polyvinyl acetate, starches, gums, polyvinyl alcohol, animal<br>
glues, acrylics, epoxies, polyethylene-containing adhesives, and rubber-<br>
containing adhesives. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the adhesive can<br>
be applied to the substrate, or to the substantially nonporous material, or to both<br>
the substrate and the substantially nonporous material. In a further non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the adhesive can be introduced via the use of a tie carrier coating.<br>
The process of bonding the substrate and substantially nonporous<br>
material in the presence of an adhesive generally includes inserting inserting the<br>
substrate/adhesive/material construction into standard processing equipment<br>
which is known in the art. Heat and/or pressure can be applied to the<br>
substrate/adhesive/material construction for a period of time. The amount of<br>
heat and/or pressure and length of time can vary widely. In general, the<br>
temperature, pressure and time are selected such that the substrate and<br>
substantially nonporous material are at least partially connected together to form<br>
a multi-layer article. A typical temperature can be within the range of from 38°C-<br>
204°C. A typical pressure can be within the range of from one (1) second to<br>
thirty (30) minutes. The multilayer article may then be cooled under pressure for<br>
a typical time period, such as thirty (30) minutes. Although the strength of the<br>
bond formed between the ink jet recordable substrate and the substantially<br>
nonporous material can vary, the bond generally can be such that it typically<br>
exceeds the tensile properties of the substrate alone.<br>

recordable substrate can be molded using a variety of conventional molding<br>
techniques known in the art, which can include but are not limited to<br>

laminating, thermoforming vacuum forming, extrusion coating, continuous belt<br>
laminating and extrusion laminating.<br>
In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the substrate can be molded in the<br>
presence or the absence of a substantially nonporous material, such as a<br>
thermoplastic and/or thermoset polymer. In general, the ink jet recordable<br>
substrate is inserted into standard molding equipment which is known in the art.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, a thermoplastic and/or thermoset polymer is<br>
introduced onto the substrate and then the substrate/polymer construction is<br>
inserted into the mold cavity. In another one non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
substrate is placed into the mold cavity and then the thermoplastic and/or<br>
thermoset polymer is introduced onto the substrate. Heat and/or pressure can be<br>
applied to the substrate/polymer construction for a period of time. The amount<br>
of heat and/or pressure and time length of time can vary widely. In general, the<br>
temperature, pressure and time are selected such that the substrate and polymer<br>
are at least partially connected together to form a multi-layer article. A typical<br>
temperature can be within the range of form a multi-layer article. A typical<br>
temperature can be within the range of from 38°C-204°C. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, wherein the polymer comprises a thermoplastic polymer, the<br>
substrate/polymer construction can be heated to a temperature that equals or<br>
exceeds the melt temperature of the thermoplastic polymer. In one non-limiting<br>
embodiment, where the thermoplastic polymer can be amorphous, the substrate<br>
polymer construction can be heated to a temperature that equals or exceeds the<br>
Vicat temperature. In an alternative non-limiting embodiment, wherein the<br>
polymer comprises a thermoset polymer, the temperature can be below the<br>
curing or crosslinking temperature of the polymer. A typical pressure can be<br>
within the range of from 0.34-1.7 X 105pas and a typical period of time can be in<br>
the range of from one (1) second to fifteen (15) minutes. The result of a typical<br>
molding process is a re-shaping is generally defined by the design of the mold<br>
cavity. Thus, in a standard molding process,, a two-dimensional flat sheet can be<br>
re-shaped into a three-dimensional article.<br>

partially interconnected or interlinked with the ink jet recordable substrate and/or<br>
the substantially nonporous material, such that the silicone can be essentially<br>
fixed to the surface of said substrate and/or said material. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the molecules of a thermoplastic resin component can be<br>
interconnected by fusion to the ink jet recordable substrate and/or the<br>
substantially nonporous material. In another non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
molecules of a thermoset resin component can be interlinked by crosslinking to<br>
the ink jet recordable substrate and/or the substantially nonporous material.<br>
In a further non-limiting embodiment, the friction-reducing coating<br>

can employ a wide variety of known techniques. In alternate non-limiting<br>
embodiments, the techniques described previously herein for applying the<br>
substantially water-resistant coating to the ink jet recordable substrate can be<br>
used for application of the friction-reducing coating composition to the ink jet<br>
recordable substrate and/or the substantially nonporous material.<br>
The amount of the substantially dry friction-reducing coating applied to<br>
the substrate/material, or "coat weight", is typically measured as coating weight<br>
per coated area. The coat weight can vary widely. In alternate non-limiting can<br>

imparting to the substantially nonporous material unique properties of the<br>
substrate surface. The ink jet recordable substrate can be decorated with a<br>
variety of methods including: offset/lithographic printing, flexographic printing,<br>
painting, gravure printing, inkjet printing, electrophotographic printing,<br>
sublimation printing, thermal transfer printing, and screen printing. Decorating<br>
can also include applying a single or multilayer coating to the ink jet recordable<br>
substrate via normal coating methods known in the art. In general, the unique<br>
properties that an ink jet recordable substrate can impart on a substantially<br>
nonporous material include, but are not limited to one or more of: improved<br>
surface energy, increased porosity, decreased porosity, increased bond strength<br>
of post coat layer, and modification of the polymer's surface texture or pattern.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
In preparing a coating composition of the present invention, a 31%<br>
polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride sold under the trade name CinFix RDF<br>
available from Stockhausen GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Krefeld, Germany was diluted to<br>
10% with deionized water in a stainless steel or polyethylene mix vessel under<br>
mild agitation. Mild agitation defined by a medium pitch three lobed mixing head,<br>
the system at a mix-head to mix vessel diameter ratio of 1 to 3 and the mix-head<br>
spinning at 600 -1000 rpm and appropriately positioned: In a separate mix<br>
container, a 29% aqueous cationic acrylic solution sold under the name WC-71-<br>
2143 available from PPG Industries, Inc. is diluted with deionized water to 10%<br>
and added to the main mix vessel containing pre diluted CinFix RDF. In a •<br>
separate mix container, a 30% aqueous cationic polyurethane dispersion sold<br>
under the trade name Witcobond W240 available from Crompton Corporation is<br>
diluted with deionized water to 10% and added to the main mix vessel containing<br>
the CinFix RDF and PPG WC-71-2143 mixture. The resultant coating<br>
composition is stirred for 15 minutes. The resultant pH was 5.5 +/- 0.5. The<br>
total solids of the composition was 10% and a viscosity of 56cps measured using<br>
a Brookfield viscometer, RVT, spindle no. 1, at 50 rpm and 25°C.<br>
For comparison with 8181-67-09, other coating compositions were<br>
produced using alternate CinFix additives and polyurethane dispersions with or<br>
without WC-71-2143.<br><br>
All values are in parts by weight (pbw).<br>

from PPG Industries of Pittsburgh, PA.<br>
PPG formulation no. WC-71-2143 is as an aqueous secondary amine and<br>
hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer prepared via solution polymerization. Also<br>
described as a cationic acrylic polymer aqueous dispersion. WC-71-2143 was<br>
prepared as follows.<br><br>
% 2'-Azobis(2-methyibutanenitrile) initiator commercially available from E.I. du<br>
Pont de Nemours and company, Wilmington, Delaware<br>
The initial charge was heated in a rector with agitation to reflux temperature<br>
(80°C). The Feed 1 was added in a continuous manner over a period of 3 hours.<br>
At the completion of feed 1 addition, the reaction mixture was held at reflux for<br>
3 hours. The resultant acrylic polymer solution had a total solids content of 61.7<br>
percent (determined by weight difference of a sample before and after heating at<br>
110°C. for one hour) and number average molecular weight of 4792 as<br>
determined by gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene as the<br>
standard. Thereafter, Feed 2 was added over five minutes at room temperature<br>
with agitation. After the completion of the addition of freed 2, Feed 3 was added<br>
over 30 minutes while the reaction mixture was heated for azeotropic distillation<br>
of isopropanol. When the distillation collected was 550.6 grams. The product,<br>
which was a cationic acrylic polymer aqueous solution, had a solids content of<br>
32.6 percent by weight (determined by weight difference of a sample before and<br>
after heating at 110°C. for one hour), and a pH of 5.25.<br>
Note: All % solids values are % by weight.<br>
Coatings were applied to bank 21.6 X 27.9 cm TS 1000 sheet. Coating weight is<br>
measured by difference using an electronic balance.<br>
• The blank sheet is weight.<br>
• Coating is applied to the front side using a #9 wire-wrapped rod.<br>
• The sheet is baked at 95° C in a textile oven (Model LTF from Werner Mathis<br>
AG, Zurich, Switzerland) for 2 minutes.<br>
• The sheet is removed from the oven and coating is applied to the backside<br>
using a #9 wire-wrapped rod.<br>
• The sheet is re-baked at 95° C in the textile oven for 2 minutes.<br>
• The sheet is removed, allowed to cool to the touch and reweighed.<br>
• Coating weight in milligrams/square-inch is determined by dividing weight<br>
difference in milligrams by coated area.<br>
The dynamic viscosity of the mixed coatings was measured using a #2 Zahn cup<br>
and the static viscosity was measured using a Brookfield Model DV-1+<br>
viscometer using a #2 spindle at 100 rpm.<br>
Test prints from the coated Teslin sheets were generated off of an HP960C<br>
printer, set to normal default print mode. Optical density values were measured<br>
using an X-Rite® densitometer, model type 418, normalized against a Macbeth®<br>
black/white plate.<br>
Test prints were also generated using uncoated Teslin TS1000 for comparison.<br>
Optical density values are listed in the following table.<br>
Coating 8181-67-09 is clearly the best overall in optical density performance of<br>
all the examples as is illustrated in the following graphic representation of the<br>
previous Table. The use of WC-71-2143 in the formula provides improved<br>
optical density over polyurethane dispersion-only formulas.<br>
Coating 8181-67-09 was applied to 8½" x 11" sheets of Teslin® TS1000 and<br>
SP 1000 and cured as described above. Test prints from the coated Teslin<br>
sheets were generated off of an HP960C printer, set to normal default print<br>
mode. Optical density values were measured using an X-Rite® densitometer,<br>
model type 418, normalized against a Macbeth® black/white standard plate.<br>
Optical density values are listed in the following table.<br>
Example 2<br>
Coating composition prepared as in example 1 and was applied to a 500ft<br>
roll of 10.5mil Teslin TS1000 microporous substrate by a flexographic or gravure<br>
coating method. In this coating method, a line consisting of two coating station,<br>
each with a forced air drying oven was used. Each coating station consists of a<br>
coating feed chamber, anilox roll and rubber application roll. The coating feed<br>
chambers were supplied from a coating holding tank and pump. Continuous roll<br>
stock was threaded through the equipment so that both side were coated during<br>
a single pass. The apparatus was fitted with a 7BCM (billion cubic microns) roll<br>
and a 5BCM anilox roll. Successive passes were arranged so that both sheet<br>
surfaces contacted the rubber roll wet by each anilox roll type at least once. The<br>
complete coating sequence is described as follows: Pass #1 (7bcm-face/5bcm-<br>
back) + Pass #2 (7bcm-face/5bcm-back) + Pass #3 (5bcm-face/7bcm-back).<br>
The line speed was 73m/um, oven temperature was 105°C (220°F) and 3 passes<br>
per roll were made, which translates into 3 passes per surface. The coating<br>
composition was applied with an approximate coat weight of 0.73g/m2 (total<br>
front and back). The resultant roll was converted into 8.5" X 11" sheets, grain<br>
long. Test prints were generated off an HP960C printer, set to normal default<br>
print mode. Both sides of the substrate were printed. Optical density values were<br>
measured using an X-Rite® densitometer, model type 418, normalized against a<br>
Macbeth® black/white standerd plate. Optical densities values are listed in the<br>
following table.<br><br>
In addition to optical density the prints had good overall aesthetics, distinctness<br>
of image and quality.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Two 6,600ft rolls 287µm TS1000 were sized with coating composition<br>
described in example 1 in the same manner as described in example 2. the<br>
resultant rolls was converted into 8.5" X ll"sheets, grain long. Test prints were<br>
generated off of an HP960C printer set to normal default print mode and best ink<br>
jet photo grade matte finish. Both sides of the substrate were printed. Optical<br>
density values were measured using an X-Rite® densitometer, model type 418,<br>
normalized against a Macbeth® black/white standard plate. Optical densities<br>
values are listed in the following table.<br>
In addition to the optical density values, the prints generated using best mode<br>
had better image quality compared to normal mode prints. These same images<br>
printed using best mode had very good pigmented ink adhesion as measured<br>
using a coin rub test. The printed surface was rubbed with a coin until the<br>
substrate began to fatigue and fail.<br>
The printed surface maintained an acceptable distinctness of image with very<br>
little ink rub off.<br>
Example 4<br>
A treated sheet (sample A) from the substrate prepared in the previous<br>
example was printed with a test print pattern; using printer type HP960c set on<br>
best mode, ink jet photo grade matte finish. The optical density of color bars<br>
representing the five primary color/ink types: composite black, cyan, magenta,<br>
yellow and pigment black were measured. The printed color bars were<br>
submerged in de-ionized water for 24 hours and the resultant optical densities<br>
measured. The procedure was then repeated after a total of 96 hours of<br>
continuous soaking. The test was repeated on two additional samples (B &amp; C)<br>
from the same lot of substrate and both printed in the same manner. The optical<br>
density values are given in the following tables.<br>
Optical Density Retention (Sample C)<br>
All color bars remained solid after 96hours of soaking time. Also only some slight<br>
bleed was off of the composite and pigment black color bars. Bold 10point font<br>
that was part of the test print samples remained legible.<br>
Example 5<br>
Several 6,600ft rolls of 287µm Teslin TSlOOOwere sized with coating<br>
composition described in example 1 in accordance the technique described in<br>
example 2. The resultant rolls was converted into 8.5" X 11" sheets, grain long.<br>
Test prints were generated off of an HP960C printer, set to best ink jet photo<br>
grade matte finish. Both sides of the substrate were printed. The optical density<br>
of color bars representing the five primary color/ink types: composite black,<br>
cyan, magenta, yellow and pigment black were measured. The printed color bars<br>
were submerged in tap water for 15minutes and the resultant optical densities<br>
measured. The procedure was then repeated after a total of 24hours of<br>
continuous soaking. The optical density values are given in the following tables.<br>
Optical Density Retention - Side A<br>
24hrs, Tap Water<br>
Optical Density Retention - Side B<br>
24hrs, Tap Water<br>
All color bars remained solid after 24hours of soaking time in tap water. No<br>
bleed was visible off of any of the colors. Bold 10point font that was part of the<br>
test print samples, printed in composite black maintained good optical clarity.<br>
Example 6<br>
Samples collected after two coating passes during the campaign<br>
described in the previous example were converted into 8.5" x 11" sheets, grain<br>
long and tested. Test prints were generated off of an HP960C printer, set to best<br>
ink jet photo grade matte finish. Both sides of the substrate were printed. The<br>
optical density of color bars representing the five primary color/ink types:<br>
composite black, cyan, magenta, yellow and pigment black were measured. The<br>
printed color bars were submerged in tap water for 15minutes and the resultant<br>
optical densities measured. The procedure was then repeated after a total of<br>
24hrs of continuous soaking. The optical density values are given in the<br>
following tables.<br>
In addition to the optical density retention results, a slight amount of bleed was<br>
visible off of both the composite and pigment black inks after 24 hours of water<br>
soak time. The 24 hour soaked samples had a very minor grainy pattern and the<br>
all printed text maintain good optical clarity.<br>
Example 7<br>
Substrate samples were produced in accordance with operational settings<br>
outlined in example 2, with the exception of coating sequence and with the<br>
coating adjusted from 10% to 7% active solids. Samples were collected after 2,<br>
3 and 4 passes. The coating sequence followed for the 2 pass samples is: Pass<br>
#1 (7bcm-face/5bcm-back) + Pass #2 (5bcm-face/7bcm-back). The coating<br>
sequence followed for the 3 pass samples is: Pass #1 (7bcm-face/5bcm-back) +<br>
Pass #2 (7bcm-face/5bcm-back) + Pass #3 (5bcm-face/7bcm-back). The<br>
coating sequence followed for the 4 pass samples is: Pass #1 (7bcm-<br>
face/5bcm-back) + Pass #2 (7bcm-face/5bcm-back) + Pass #3 (5bcm-<br>
faceA7bcm-back) + Pass #4 (5bcm-face/7bcm-back). The samples collected<br>
after two, three and four coating passes were converted into 8.5" x 11" sheets,<br>
grain long and tested. Test prints were generated off of an HP960C printer, set<br>
to best ink jet photo grade matte finish. Both sides of the substrate were printed.<br>
The optical density of color bars representing the five primary color/ink types:<br>
composite black, cyan, magenta, yellow and pigment black were measured. The<br>
printed color bars were submerged in tap water for 15minutes and the resultant<br>
optical densities measured. The procedure was then repeated after a total of<br>
24hrs of continuous soaking. The optical density values are given in the<br>
following tables.<br>
Optical Density Retention - Side A, 7% solids, 2 - pass<br>
24hrs, Tap Water<br>
In addition to optical density retention, differences were observed in the print<br>
quality following the 24hour tap water soak. The 2 and 3 pass samples became<br>
grainy following 24-hour water soak. The grainy appearance was more obvious<br>
for the 2-pass sample than for the 3 pass sample. Some bleed was visible off of<br>
the composite and pigmented black color bars. Bleed resistance improved as the<br>
number of coating passes increased. Bold lOpoint font that was part of the test<br>
print samples, printed in composite black maintained good optical clarity for all<br>
three sample types.<br>
Example 8<br>
Two 6,600ft rolls of 287µm Teslin TS1000 were sized with coating<br>
composition described in example 1, formulated at 12.5% active solids in<br>
accordance with operational settings described in example 2. The prints were<br>
generated off the substrate were printed. Optical density values were measured<br>
using an X-Rite® densitometer, model type 418, normalized against a Macbeth®<br>
black/white standard plate. Optical densities values are listed in the following<br>
table.<br>
In addition to optical density the prints had excellent overall aesthetics,<br>
distinctness of image and quality.<br>
Example 9<br>
A coating composition prepared as in example 1, with the exception that<br>
the resultant solids content was 12.5% instead of 10%. The coating composition<br>
was applied to a 2012m roll of 283µm Teslin SP1000 microporous substrate by a<br>
flexographic or gravure coating method as described in example 2. The resultant<br>
roll was converted into 8.5" X 11" sheets, grain long. Test prints were generated<br>
off of an HP960C printer, set to best ink jet photo grade matte finish. Both sides<br>
of the substrate were printed. Optical density values were measured using an X-<br>
Rite® densitometer, model type 418, normalized against a Macbeth® black/white<br>
standard plate. Optical densities values are listed in the following table.<br>
In addition to optical density the prints had good overall aesthetics, distinctness<br>
of image and quality.<br>
Composite Sheet and Card Fabrication<br>
Example 10 - Hydraulic Platen Lamination (One Composite Sheet)<br>
Sheet 66 X 97cm of treated Teslin TS1000 substrate 287µm thick, were<br>
cut from a master roll in the grain long direction. The Teslin had been coated<br>
with 3 passes on each side (3 X 3) using the same coating composition as<br>
described in example 1 and the same Flexographic coating technology described<br>
in example 2. One coated Teslin sheet was placed on top of one 26-inch X 38-<br>
inch sheet of 0.21-inch polyvinylchloride (PVC), supplied by Empire Plastic. The<br>
PVC sheet was cut in the grain long direction. A sheet (69 X 99cm) of (50.8µm)<br>
clear polyester was placed over the Teslin sheet to act as a release liner. (Note!<br>
This release liner is removed from the composits sheets.) This construction was<br>
placed between two 69 X 99cm X 762µm polished stainless steel metal plate.<br>
The resultant stack was then placed between two 69 X 99cm X 3.175mm unpolished <br>
non-corrosive metal plates. This entire construction was placed in a<br>
200- Ton Wabash laminating press, preheated to 104°C. The composite<br>
construction was compression laminated pressure of 13.8 X 105 pas for 8minutes<br>
at a temperature of 104°C. While under press, the platens were cooled to less<br>
than 38°C, which took approximately 22minutes. After being removed from the<br>
press, the resultant composite sheet had good integrity; any attempt to<br>
delaminate destroyed the Teslin layer, which demonstrated a good adhesive and<br>
seamless bond between the Teslin layer, which demonstrates a good adhesive<br>
and cut from the resultant 66 X 97cm X 795µm composite sheet. The finished<br>
cards had good integrity and good lat flat. Any attempt to delaminate destroyed<br>

over the Teslin sheet to act as a release liner. This construction was placed<br>
between two (69 X 99cm) X 762µm polished stainless steel metal plate. An<br>
identical polyester/treated Teslin sheet/PVC lay-up was placed on top of a<br>
stainless plate from the existing construction. A polished metal plate was placed<br>
over the exposed polyester release liner. The pattern was repeated twice more<br>
so that four pre-pressed multi-layer ply's existed in the stack. The resultant stack<br>
was then placed between two 69 X 99cm X 1.175µm un-polished non-corrosive<br>
metal plates. This entire construction, referred to as a book, was placed in a 200-<br>
Ton Wabash laminating press, preheated to 104°C. The composite construction<br>
was compression laminated at a pressure of 13.8 X 105 pas for 8 minutes at a<br>
temperature of 109°C. While under press, the platens were cooled to less than<br>
38°C, which took approximately 22minutes. After being removed from the press,<br>
all four finished composite sheets had good integrity; any attempt to delaminate<br>
destroyed the Teslin layer, which demonstrated a good adhesive and seamless<br>
bond between the Teslin and the PVC. ISO7910 ID-1 cards were die cut from the<br>
each of the 66 X 97cm X 775µm composite sheets. The finished cards from each<br>

This construction was placed between two 53 X 66cm X 762µm polished stainless<br>
steel metal plate. An identical polyester/treated Teslin sheet/PVC/PVC/magnetic<br>
stripe master sheet lay-up was placed on top of a stainless plate from the<br>
existing construction. A polished metal plate was placed over the exposed<br>
polyester release liner. The pattern was repeated ten more times so that twelve<br>
pre-pressed multi-layer plys existed in the stack. The resultant stack was placed<br>
between buffer pads. The resultant stack plus buffer pads was then placed<br>
between two slightly larger 3.175cm un-polished non-corrosive metal plates. This<br>
entire construction, referred to as a book, was placed in a TMP laminating at a<br>
pressure of 14 X 105pas for 18minutes at a temperature of 149°C. While under<br>
press, the platens were cooled to less than 38°C, which took approximately<br>
19minutes. After being<br>
removed from the press, all twelve composite sheets were removed from the<br>
book. All twelve finished composite sheets had good integrity; any attempt to<br>
delaminate destroyed the Teslin layer, which demonstrated a good adhesive and<br>
seamless bond between the Teslin and the PVC. ISO7910 ID-1 cards were die<br>
cut from the each of the 51 X 63.5cm X 775pm composite sheets. The finished<br>
cards from each composite sheet had good integrity and good lat flat. Any<br>
attempt to delaminate destroyed the Teslin layer, which demonstrated a good<br>
adhesive and seamless bond between the Teslin and the PVC.<br>
Example 25 -(12 Composite Sheets/Book, Magnetic Stripe Version - failed)<br>
Sheets 51 X 63.5cm of treated Teslin substrate, 287um thick, were cut<br>
from a master roll in the grain long direction. The Teslin had been coated with 3<br>
passes on each side (3 X 3) using the same coating composition as described in<br>
example 1 and the same Flexographic coating technology described in example<br>
2. One coated Teslin sheet was placed on top of one 51 X 63.5cm sheet of 0.10-<br>
inch polyvinylchloride (PVC), supplied by Empire Plastics. The PVC sheet was cut<br>
in the grain long direction. Below the PVC ply was a second ply of 51 X 63.5cm X<br>
50.8µm PVC Magnetic Stripe master sheet, fabricated with the magnetic stripe<br>
running parallel to the short (20") dimension of the sheet. The magnetic stripes<br>
were 3 level, 2750 coercivity type. A sheet 53 X 66cm X 50.8µm clear polyester<br>
was placed over the Teslin sheet to act as a release liner. This construction was<br>
placed between two 53 X 66cm X 762µm polished stainless steel metal plate. An<br>
identical polyester/treated Teslin sheet/PVC/PVC/magnetic stripe master sheet<br>
lay-up was placed on top of a stainless plate from the existing construction. A<br>
polished metal plate was placed over the exposed polyester release liner. The<br>
pattern was repeated ten more times so that twelve pre-pressed multi-layer plys<br>
existed in the stack. The resultant stack was placed between buffer pads. The<br>
resultant stack plus buffer pads was then placed between two slightly larger<br>
3.175pµ un-polished non-corrosive metal plates. This entire construction,<br>
referred to as a book, was placed in a TMP laminating press, preheated to 121°C.<br>
The<br>
composite construction was compression laminated at a pressure of 14 X 105pas<br>
for 18minutes at a temperature of 121°C. While under press, the platens were<br>
cooled to less than 38°C, which took approximately 17minutes. After being<br>
removed from the press, all twelve composite sheets were removed from the<br>
book. The PVC plys from all twelve finished composite sheets were pealed apart.<br>
None of the Teslin plys could be delaminated from the adjacent PVC sheet,<br>
indicating a good adhesive and seamless bond between the Teslin and the PVC.<br>
Since the PVC plys did not laminate, no attempt to fabricate ISO7910 ID-1 cards<br>
was made.<br>
Example 26 (Condition of cards/ Composite Sheets)<br>
Cards fabricated according to example 19, were individually soaked in<br>
deionized water for 15minutes then allowed air dry for 24 hours. Resultant<br>
conditioned cards demonstrated easier separation from a stack and slip<br>
characteristics compared to the unconditioned version.<br>
Example 27 (Conditioning of Cards/Composite Sheets)<br>
Cards fabricated according to example 19, were individually conditioned at<br>
75% RH and 25C for 16hours. Resultant conditioned cards demonstrated easier<br>
separation from a stack and slip characteristics compared to the unconditioned<br>
version.<br>
Example 28 (Conditioning of Cards/Composite Sheets)<br>
Cards fabricated according to example 19, were individually conditioned at<br>
75% RH and 25C for 16hours. Resultant conditioned cards demonstrated easier<br>
separation from a stack and slip characteristic compared to the unconditioned<br>
version.<br>
Example 29 (Condition of Cards/Composite Sheets)<br>
Composite sheets fabricated according to example 19, were individually<br>
soaked in deionized water for 15minutes then allowed air dry for 24 hours.<br>
ISO7910ID-1 cards were die cut from the each of the 51 X 63.5cm X<br>
775pm composite sheets. The finished cards from each composite sheet had<br>
good integrity and good lat flat. Any attempt to delaminate destroyed the Teslin<br>
layer, which demonstrated a good adhesive and seamless bond between the<br>
Teslin and the PVC. Resultant conditioned cards demonstrated easier separation<br>
from a stack and slip characteristics compared to the unconditioned version.<br>
