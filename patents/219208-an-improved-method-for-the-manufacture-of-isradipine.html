Field of the invention<br>
Tlie present invention relates to an improved method for the manufacture of Isradipine, 4-(4-Benzofura2anyl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid methyl 1-methylethyl ester. More particularly the present invention relates to the process for the manufacture of Isradipine of substantially high purity and relatively free from the symmetrical ester impurities.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Isradipine is 4-(4-Benzofiara2anyl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxyhc acid methyl 1-methylethyl ester having the chemical structure of formula (I).<br><br>
Isradipine is therapeutically indicated for treating cardiovascular diseases. The cardiovascular diseases include angina, pectoris, hypertension and congestive heart failure. It is also used to treat high blood pressure.<br>
Isradipine was disclosed in the German specification DE 2949491 and US patent Nos. 4466972 and 4567271. DE 2949491  describes die general procedure to<br><br>
prepare 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives. US 4466972, GbU21U3ZU3A, i.u 0088342A9, EP 0000150A1, EP 0000150B1, AU 0538515B2 and other related patents describe the general method for the preparation of Benzoxadiazoles and tiieir derivatives of general formula (II). These references in its entirety is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.<br><br>
Where in Ri is -CH3 and R2 is -CH(CH3)2 it refers to Isradipine of fomula (I). When Ri and R2 are not identical the general procedures described in these patent specifications produces a mixture of isomers of formula (II). These procedures for the preparation of Isradipine is characteristic of formation of the isomeric impurities, 1) 4-(4-Ben2ofura2anyl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarbox^'lic acid di-methyl ester of formula (III) and 2) 4-(4-Ben2ofurazanyl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimediyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid di-1-mcthylethyl ester of formula (IV) along with Isradipine.<br>
The US patent 4466972 describes the preparation of compounds of general formula (II) by refluxing 2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde, keto ester and concentrated ammonia or a p-amino ester in presence of elhanol, followed by evaporation and purification by chromatography.<br><br><br>
These symmetrical ester isomers (III) and (IV) are difficult to separate from the Isradipine and the separation is effected only by a chromatograpliic purifications. The drawback with the procedures described in these patents is that it is very difficult to produce the product in commercial quantities as it involves die purification of the product by chromatographic separations.<br>
A single step process for die preparation of Isradipine was described in CH 661270. This procedure involves first reacting 2,l,3-t)enzoxadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde with isopropyl acetoacetate in the presence of catalytic quantities of acetic acid and pipetidine in refluxing tokiene, and further reacting it with mediyl-B-aminocrotonate, The Isradipine formed in the reaction mixture was<br><br>
then separated by toluene distillation followed by cyclohexane treatment. The crude product obtained was then crystallised from ethanol to get Isradipine. When we have repeated this process in our laboratory we got the Isradipine with substantially higher amount of symmetrical ester isomers (III) and (IV) are present in the product. Removal of these symmetrical ester isomers is very difficult even after several repurifications from ethanol<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The object of die present invention is to provide an improved metliod for the manufacture of Isradipine, 4-(Ben2ofuran2ayl)-l, 4-dihydro - 2, 6 - dimethyl - 3, 5 - pyridine dicarboxylic acid methyl-1-methylethyl ester.<br>
It is a further object of the instant invention to obtain Isradipine of substantially liigh purity and relatively free from die symmetrical ester impurities, capable of being used to product commercial quantities of Isradipine pharmaceutical grade.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
To acliieve the afore-mentioned objects, the present invention provides for a process for die manufacture of the Isradipine wliich, involves two steps. In die first step 2,l,3-ben2oxadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde is reacted with methyl acetoacetate in the presence of acetic acid and piperidine in diisopropyl ether. The product 2-acetyl-3-ben2ofiara2an-4-yl-acr)^lic acid methyl ester is isolated and purified to get substantially high purit}^ product with less than 0.3% 2,1,3-ben20xadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde content present in die purified product. In die second step the purified intermediate 2-acet\4-3-ben2ofura2an-4-yl-acnlic acid methyl ester is reacted watli isopropyl-B-atninocrotonate in ethanol at 25 ro 35"C. The crude Isradipine is cn^stallised from ethanol to get pure Isradipine having substantially higher purit}^ and containing lower amount of the symmetncal ester isomers (III) and (IV).<br><br>
The instant invention specifically provides for an improved method for the manufacture of 4-(4-Benzofizrazanyl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid methyl 1-methylethyl ester comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) reacting 2,l,3-benzoxadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde with methyl acetoacetate in the presence of acetic acid and piperidine in diisopropyl ether to obtain 2-acetyl-3-benzofiirazan-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester;<br>
(ii) isolating and purifying 2-acetyl-3-benzofurazan-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester to obtain purified 2-acetyl-3-benzofurazan-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester and<br>
(iii) reacting 2-acetyl-3-benzofurazan-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester with isopropyl-B-aminocrotonate in ethanol to obtain 4-(4-Benzofurazanyl)-l,4-dihydro-,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic ^id methyl 1-methylethyl ester.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved method for the manufacture of Isradipine, 4-(4-Ben2ofura2anyl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid methyl 1-methylethyl ester. More particularly the present invention relates to the process for the manufacture of Isradipine of substantially high purity and relatively free from the symmetrical ester impurities.<br>
The present process for the manufacture of the Isradipine involves two steps. The following scheme 1 illustrates a reaction sequence of the present invention for die manufacture of the Isradipine.<br><br>
In die first step, 2,l,3-benzoxadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde is reacted with medayl acetoacetate in the presence of acetic acid and piperidine in diisopropyl ether. Tlie reaction is carried out in diisopropyl ether under reflux with simultaneous removal of water formed during the reaction. Removal of the water from the reaction mixture enables die reaction to proceed at a faster rate. The reacaon is<br><br>
r.<br>
completed at the end of theoretical amount of water removal from the reaction mixture. The completion of the reaction is determined by qualitative HPLC analysis. In this reaction methyl acetoacetate 0.9 to 1.1 mol is used for even^ 1.0 mol of 2,l,3-ben20xadia2ole-4-carboxaldehyde, preferably 0.95 to 1.0 mol mediyl acetoacetate is used for every 1.0 mol of 2,l,3-ben2oxadia2ole-4-carboxaldehyde. Acetic acid and piperidine are used in catalytic amount, preferably acetic acid 0.25 to 0.30 mol and piperidine 0.08 to 0.06 mol is used for every 1.0 mol of 2,1,3-ben2oxadia2ole-4-carboxaldehyde. This reaction goes to completion after 8 to 12 lir at reflux. The reaction tnixture is then washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, followed by dilute sodium bicarbonate solution and followed by water. The crude product 2-acetyl-3-ben2ofurazan-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester is then obtained by distillation of diisopropyl ether under vacuum.<br>
The crude product is then crystallised from diisopropyl edier to get die pure 2-acet)^l-3-ben2ofura2an-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester having purity more dian 99% (both cis and trans isomers), and it contained less than 0.3% 2,l,3-ben2oxadia2ole-4-carboxaldehyde by HPLC. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the crude product is crystalli2ed from ethanol to get substantially pure 2-acet\d-3-benzofura2an-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester as it allows for obtaining better vields.<br>
In the second step, 2-acetyl-3-ben2ofura2an-4-yl-acrylic acid methyl ester is reacted with isopropyl-B-aminocrotonate in ethanol at 25 to 40°C and preferably at 25 to 35°C. In this reaction isopropyl-B-aminocrotonate 0.9 to 1.05 mol is used for ever}^ 1.0 mol of 2-acetyl-3-ben2ofura2an-4-yl-acrylic acid mediyl ester, preferably 0.95 to 1.0 mol is used for every 1.0 mol of 2-acetyl-3-benzofura2an-4-yl-acr}^lic acid mediyl ester. This reaction goes to the completion in 6 to 8 lir at 30°C. Ethanol is removed from the reaction mixture at less than 50°C under vacuum to get the concentrate containing Isradipine. The concentrate is dissolved m ethyl acetate and washed with water to remove a iitde amount of the unknown water soluble impurities formed in this reaction. The water washed ethyl acetate I'AVCM is then concentrated at less than 50°C under reduced pressure. The concentrate is dien dissolved in ethanol at 65 to 80°C and cooled to get the<br><br>
4<br>
Isradipine crystallised from the solution. The product is optionally recrystallised from ethanol to get pure Isradipine having typical purity more than 99.4% and die impurity (III) less than 0.3% and impurity (IV) less than 0.2% and other unknown impurity total less than 0.1% by HPLC analysis.<br>
