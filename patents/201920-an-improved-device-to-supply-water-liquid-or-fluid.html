				<td>This invention is an improved device for to supply water from one place to the other end. This invention can supply water from the well or from the deep well or even from the borewell; without electric power or electric facilities (such as motor) and without any bucket pulleying. Water, liquid, fluid or anything those are in the viscous nature can supply from one place to the other end with this invention.<br>
The field to which this invention pertain is mainly supply of water from the well or from the borewell. Anything those have viscous nature can supply by the help of this invention. As it is working without the aid of electric power, both elctricity and money can be saved. Save electricity is same as to create electricity and more than that it will be very helpful to the farmers and as a result agricultural prosperity can be ensured by its use.<br>
In the known art, pulleying bucket; and motor pumping is the usual method. Pulleying the bucket with water is a tough work. Lot of pulleying is also needed. Pumping water by the use of motor is also not so dependable because electric failure or motor failure may create problems. It is expensive also.<br>
But this invention can solved all these problems. By a single use it supply water as much as that of the containers capacity (which is immerced in the water as in fig). Once fixed it can be used regularly for years and maintence will be very negligible in normal case. Another advantage is that clear and filtered water can be ensured from the well itself. Its object is to ensure clean water supply with less effort and with less expense and without electricity and can ensure prosperity in the agricultural field by helping farmers with its use.<br>
In short, this invention is simple, economic and efficient. It is much dependable as it is working without the aid of electric power. By a single use as much as water needed can ensure (depends on the quantity or capacity of the container).<br><br>
Briefly the invention can be described as follows Fig. 1 shows a normal view of the invention. Fig. 2 is for to show the inside view when at normal. Here 'a' represents outer container or case, 'b' inner portion T 'g' 'fo' and 'e' present on the outer case while in the inner main portion or in the pressing portion 'f' present. In normal condition water comes to inside of the container and when on work that water goes out and it is cleared in the fig. 2 and 3.<br>
Detailed description of the invention with the help of figures is as follows. Here 'a' represents outer container, 'b' inner presser or covering like main portion, 'c' Flexible pipe or tube 'd' spring portion, 'e' broken portion for exhausting or to release out remaining water and wastes, if any. 'fo' outside filter while T inner filter. Outside filters hole will small and inside filtered hole will be comparatively big. 'g' is a shade like arrangement for to release away the remainings or wastes, so that outer containers finishings will last longer. T is an arrangement for to accept water to inside, 'i' is the pulley while 'j' represents the string and 'k' the outer pulley. One end of the string is fixed at the outer pulley 'k' while the other end is fixed at T, an arrangement in the 'b' inner main portions pipe region. The 'm' represents the acceptor pipe and 'n' represents its fixing arrangement. Fig. lA is an arrangement for to reduce friction at the joints of pipe, if needed.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the outside view of the invention. In figure the dotted portion represents the water.<br>
In the normal case the inner main portion is in the inside of the top region of the outer case due to the action of the spring arranged and Fig 2 shows it.<br><br>
Fig. 3 explains mode of operation of the invention. When at working the inner main portion, pressing region, comes to down and due to its pressure water will rise to upward through the inside hole as shown in figure and released out through the other end, through the flexible pipe V. It can work either by pulleying the string or can be by rotating the pulley (k).<br>
Flexible pipe at the end is for to avoid the inconvenience due to its movement to downward. This inconvenience can be avoided by fixing the flexible tube into the acceptor hose or pipe (m) as in figure.<br>
Outer filter is enough to prevent the waste materials from entering into inside of the container and so only if needed inner filter needs to use. Otherwise the inner filter can avoid.<br>
In case if joints needs it is better to use the pipe as shown in fig lA, for to reduce<br>
friction.<br>
In short this invention can ensure clear filtered water from the well itself.<br><br><br><br>
I Claim: -<br>
1.	An improved device for to supply filtered clear water from the well on from<br>
the deep well or from the bore well or from anywhere, where water is<br>
available without electric power or electric facilities and this invention<br>
comprises a container, which is immersed in the water, with outer and inner<br>
filtered opening or hole and on the top of the outer container brokened<br>
portions are arranged for to release out unused water and wastes it any, will<br>
send away with the help of shades arranged and in inside of the outer<br>
container the inner presser or main portion present and through its top<br>
tapered hollow region water release out to the other end and the string is<br>
arranged for to press the inner main portion to downward when at work and<br>
spring is for to pull upwards for to stand in the normal condition and pulley is<br>
for to smoothening the work and flexible tube at the releasing and for to<br>
release out water and at the joints, frictionless joints helps to reduce friction.<br>
2.	An improved device for to supply water as claimed in claim one, can supply<br>
anything those have viscous nature (water, liquid or fluid) from one place to<br>
the other end.<br>
3.	An improved device for to supply water and other viscous natured substances<br>
from one place to the other end as here in described and illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
