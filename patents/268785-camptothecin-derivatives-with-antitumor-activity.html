				<td>CAMPTOTHECIN DERIVATIVES WITH ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY<br>
The present invention relates to novel camptothecin derivatives having<br>
antitumor activity, the processes for the preparation thereof, the use thereof<br>
as antitumor drugs and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Camptothecin is an alkaloid extracted from Camptotheca acuminata<br>
(Nyssaceae), first described by Wall and Wani in 1966 (J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>
1966, 88, 3888-3890). Camptothecin, albeit endowed with wide spectrum<br>
antitumor activity, especially against colon tumor and other solid tumors and<br>
leukemias, is not used in therapy due to its high toxicity, which is particularly<br>
manifested in the form of hemorrhagic cystitis, gastrointestinal toxicity and<br>
myelosuppression.<br>
A number of camptothecin analogues have been synthesized in order<br>
to obtain compounds having low toxicity and high solubility. At present, two<br>
drugs are used in clinical practice, namely CPT-11 and topotecan. Other<br>
derivatives, such as belotecan, rubitecan, exatecan, gimatecan,<br>
pegamotecan, lurtotecan, karenitecin, afeletecan, homocamptothecin,<br>
diflomotecan, and many others, are undergoing clinical experimentation.<br>
Compound CPT-11 is a highly soluble pro-drug for 10-hydroxy-7-<br>
ethylcamptothecin (commonly known as SN-38), approved for the treatment<br>
of many solid tumors and ascites (colorectal, skin, stomach, lung, cervice,<br>
ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma).<br>
Topotecan is a compound soluble in physiological solution, active<br>
against the tumors of the lung, stomach, liver, ovary, breast, prostate,<br>
esophagus, rectum, soft tissues sarcomas, head and neck, glioblastoma,<br>
chronic and acute myelocytic leukemias. Topotecan shows, however,<br>
important side effects such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.<br><br>
Lurtotecan is a more soluble derivative, having activity in tumors of the<br>
neck, ovary, breast, colo-rectal, and pulmonary microcytoma. However,<br>
Lurtotecan also has hematic toxicity.<br>
Rubitecan is a prodrug for the oral use effective against tumors of the<br>
pancreas, ovary and breast.<br>
Camptothecin and its analogues, as is the case with all topoisomerase<br>
I inhibitors, are effective against tumors resistant to conventional drugs,<br>
including topoisomerase II inhibitors; maintain high topoisomerase levels<br>
during the whole cell cycle; do not induce multi-drug resistance (Pgo or MRP)<br>
or detoxifying metabolism mediated by the enzyme.<br>
Research is now focused on novel inhibitors of the topoisomerase I<br>
having lower toxicity than the presently used drugs.<br>
Open-ring camptothecin derivatives show high protein binding (in<br>
particular with albumin) and low distribution in the tumor tissues. As a<br>
consequence, the product accumulates in the body and tumors are poorly<br>
affected.<br>
Conversely, the high lipophilicity of the lactone form promotes the<br>
adhesion of camptothecin derivatives to cell membranes, particularly<br>
erythrocytes, affecting the tissue/plasma distribution ratio. For this reason,<br>
research is being focused towards two alternative approaches: a) design of<br>
low protein binding products still having good solubility; b) design of highly<br>
potent products having therapeutical effect even at extremely low doses.<br>
Modifications at the 7-, 9-: 10- and 11- positions usually proved well<br>
tolerated while not affecting the stability of the DNA-Topoisomerase<br>
l-camptothecin ternary complex, the formation of which is responsible for the<br>
antitumor activity of the compounds.<br>
Products with 20R configuration proved either inactive or very less<br>
active than the products with 20S configuration - which coincides with the<br><br>
natural configuration.<br>
As a rule, modifications at the 5- position are considered unfavourable<br>
to the formation of the ternary complex, whereas modifications at the<br>
pyridone rings D and E have bee reported to be deleterious to the activity of<br>
the product.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the invention relates to camptothecin derivatives of<br>
general formula I:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
R is alkyl, aminoalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, nitrile, alkoxymino, aryloxymino,<br>
silylalkyl;<br>
R1 is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, aminoalkyl;<br>
R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, aminoalkyl, optionally protected<br>
hydroxy I;<br>
wherein the alkyl, alkoxy, aminoalkyl or alkoxymino groups can contain<br>
1 to 8, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in a straight or branched chain,<br>
whereas the aryloxymino group can contain 5 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
the pharmaceuticaily acceptable salts, isomers, enantiomers,<br>
diastereomers thereof and corresponding mixtures.<br>
The compounds of the invention show low protein binding and have<br>
good solubility and high potency even at very low doses.<br><br>
The preferred synthetic route for the preparation of the compounds of<br>
the invention is illustrated in the following scheme and substantially involves<br>
the following steps:<br>
a)	protection of the precursor hydroxy groups<br>
b)	derivatization at 5- with N,N-diprotected hydrazine<br>
c)	optional conversion of the pyridone ring to thiopyridone ring<br>
d)	removal of the protective groups with concomitant cyclization<br>
e)	optional aromatization of the pyrazole ring<br><br><br>
In the Scheme, R, R1 and R2 have the meanings described above,<br>
and PG is a hydroxy-protecting group.<br>
Hydroxyls are preferably protected by means of easily cleavable acyl<br>
groups, preferably trichloroacetate and Troc, or silyl groups, preferably<br>
triethylsilyl.<br>
Derivatization at 5- with protected hydrazine can be obtained by<br>
treating the precursor with a strong organic base, such as LiHMDS, and<br>
reacting the resulting carbanion with an aza dicarboxylate, such as di-t-<br>
butoxy aza dicarboxylate or dibenzyloxy aza dicarboxylate. Conversion of the<br>
pyridone ring to thiopyridone ring can be obtained by reaction with 2,4-bis(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-1,2,3,4-dithiaphosphethane-2,4-disulfide (commonly known<br>
as Lawesson's reagent) (Cava P.M. et al., Tetrahedron 1985, 41, 5061;<br>
Cherkasov RA et al Tetrahedron 1985 41, 2567; Ghattas AAG et al, Sulfur<br>
Lett. 1982, 1, 69; Yde B et al, Tetrahedron 1984, 40. 2047) or with an<br>
equivalent reagent. Lawesson's reagent is preferred.<br>
The purpose of the optional conversion to thiopyridone is to promote<br>
ring closure once hydrazine has been deprotected. It has however been<br>
observed that said closure reaction is spontaneous and immediate even<br>
without activation of the pyridine carbonyl for example as thiocarbonyl.<br>
When the hydroxy-protecting groups are silyls and those at the<br>
nitrogen are carbamates, they are usually removed with trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
In an alternative procedure, steps b) and c) can be reversed.<br>
The compounds of the invention were tested in a cytotoxicity assay on<br>
a wide spectrum of tumour cells. By way of example, the cytotoxicity data on<br>
the NCI-H460 cell line (NSCL cancer) concerning two compounds of formula<br>
(I) are reported, using camptothecin and the drugs Topotecan and SN-38 as<br>
references:<br><br><br>
The most active compounds were evaluated in a DNA cleavage assay<br>
measuring the active concentration and damage persistence (see the section<br>
'Examples'). The derivatives of formula (I) surprisingly show higher<br><br>
persistence in blocking DNA replication than the reference standards<br>
(particularly topotecan and camptothecin), while maintaining an effective<br>
cytotoxic activity.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing a compound of formula (I) together with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients. The pharmaceutical<br>
forms suitable to the oral or parenteral administration of the compounds (I)<br>
can be solid, preferably capsules, tablets and granules, or liquid, preferably<br>
injectable or infusion solutions.<br>
The suitably formulated compounds of the invention can be used for<br>
the treatment of solid tumors and leukemias, in particular tumors of the lung,<br>
ovary, breast, stomach, liver, prostate, soft tissue sarcomas, head and neck,<br>
esophagus, pancreas, colon, rectum, glioblastoma, chronic and acute<br>
myelocytic leukemias.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE I - 20-OTES-camptothecin<br>
Camptothecin (0.100 g, 0.287 mmol), is suspended in anhydrous<br>
dimethylformamide (3 mL), under inert atmosphere, and the resulting<br>
suspension is added with imidazole (0.980 g, 1.44 mmol). The mixture is<br>
stirred for 10' minutes, subsequently triethylsilyl chloride (TES-CI) (0.193 mL,<br>
1,15 mmol) is dropped therein, followed by addition of 4-dimethylamino<br>
pyridine (DMAP) (0.040 g 0.287 mmol). After 46 h, the reaction mixture is<br>
evaporated under vacuum, (TLC control of the complete disappearance of<br>
the reagent, eluent CH2Cl2/MeOH = 30/1). The solid is subsequently<br>
redissolved in CH2CI2 and washed with H2O and saturated NH4CI. The<br>
aqueous phase is extracted with CH2CI2 (2X10 mL). The organic phases are<br>
combined and dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under vacuum,<br>
thereby obtaining the desired product (0.133 g, 0.287 mmol) as a pale yellow<br><br>
solid.<br>

OTES-camptothecin<br>
Camptothecin 20-OTES (0.100 g, 0.216 mmol) is dissolved in<br>
anhydrous THF (6 mL) with stirring under inert atmosphere, then cooled to a<br>
temperature of-78°C and a 1.0 M LiHMDS solution in THF (0.281 mL, 0.281<br>
mmol) is dropped therein. After 20', di-tert-butylazo dicarboxyiate (DTBAC)<br>
(0.075 g, 0.324 mmol) in anhydrous THF (2 mL) is added. After 4 h at -78°C,<br>
the disappearance of the reagent is monitored by TLC (Hexane/AcOEt = 3/1).<br>
Formation of the two diastereomers is observed. The reaction is quenched by<br>
addition of saturated NH4CI. The aqueous phase is extracted with CH2CI2 (3<br>
x 15 mL) and the organic phases are combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered<br>
and concentrated under vacuum. The residue is purified by flash<br>
chromatography (Si02, Hexane/AcOEt = 3/1), thereby obtaining a mixture of<br>
the two isomers (0.145 g, 0.210 mmol, 97%). The two isomers are separated<br>
by further chromatography. In order of elution:<br>
