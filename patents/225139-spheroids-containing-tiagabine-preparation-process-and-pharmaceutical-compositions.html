				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel pharma¬ceutical form, in the form of spheroids, containing tiagabine as active principle.<br>
The invention also covers the process for the preparation of such spheroids and multiparticulate pharmaceutical preparations containing these spheroids. These pharmaceutical preparations are intended for the delivery of the spheroids they contain, and are charac¬terized in that they do not adversely affect the release profile of the tiagabine contained in the spheroids.<br>
The term spheroids is understood to refer to spherical units whose size can range from 0.25 mm to 3 mm, preferably from 0.5 mm to 1 mm.<br>
US patent 4,684,516 describes tablets for oral administration which disintegrate rapidly in aqueous medium, comprising coated granules capable of releasing an active principle at a controlled rate over several hours into the intestinal system and comprising 2 to 15% by weight of binders and lubricants.<br>
US patent 4,684,516 describes in particular granules obtained by application of a layer of active principle to unsimilar materials, these granules then being coated with a first film containing a mixture of stearic acid, carnauba wax and talc, and a second film consisting of disintegrating agents - such as starch, cellulose or alginic acid - which also serve to provide the tablet's cohesion.<br>
Patent application EP 468,436 describes prolonged-release tablets obtained by compression of an active principle and of a mixture of two powders, one being hydrophobic and the other water-soluble. The hydrophobic powder is obtained by melting and spraying a mixture of stearic acid, glycerol and hydrogenated castor oil. The water-soluble powder is a cellulose mixed with lactose.<br>
Patent application EP 548,356 describes multi-<br><br><br>
particulate tablets which are rapidly broken down, comprising an active substance in the form of mono-crystals or micro-granules.<br>
These tablets are obtained by pregranulation of a mixture of excipients consisting of one or more breakdown agents of the carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone type, one or more swelling agents of the starch type and a direct compression sugar such as dextrose. The microgranules or monocrystals are dry-mixed into the mixture of excipients before being tabletted.<br>
It has been shown that the excipients usually used to coat non-tabletted granules, such as cellulose derivatives, could not absorb the mechanical stresses to which the granules are subjected during compression (International Journal of Pharmaceutics, No. 143, 13-23, 1996).<br>
The compression of coated granules is a delicate operation since it changes the structure of the coating film by causing fissures to appear or by rupture, which leads to the partial or total loss of the properties of the film.<br>
Fissuration of the granules irreversibly changes the release profile of the active principle they contain.<br>
In order to conserve the characteristics of the film coating the granules, before and after compression, the granules of the prior art are diluted with auxiliary substances whose role is to absorb the physical stresses associated with compression (binders) and to allow disintegration of the tablet (disintegrating agents) in liquid medium, i.e. in aqueous solution or in the digestive juices.<br>
The tablet formulations of the prior art use auxiliary substances added •to the granules during compression in order to avoid surface fissuration of these granules.<br>
The subject of the present invention relates to spheroids containing tiagabine as active principle, which can be directly compressed without the addition of a substantial amount of an auxiliary substance, i.e. less<br><br>
than 5% by weight, preferably less than 1% by weight.<br>
The subject of the present invention is spheroids containing tiagabine as active principle and comprising: a core and/or a layer coating the said core, containing at least one thermoplastic excipient which is of pasty to semi-solid consistency at a temperature of about 20°C, and whose melting point is between about 25°C and about 100°C, coated with a flexible and deformable film, based on a polymer material, in particular a film whose glass transition temperature is less than about 30°C, which ensures either protection or masking of the taste, or modified and controlled release of the tiagabine. The core can be composed in particular of a mixture of sucrose and starch or microcrystalline cellulose .<br>
In the context of the present invention, thermoplastic excipients is understood to refer to compounds having a melting point of between 25 and 100°C and characterized by a pasty to semi-solid consistency at a temperature of the order of 20°C.<br>
The role of the thermoplastic excipient is, in particular, during a possible compression step, to allow the spheroids to deform plastically, and thus to absorb some of the stresses to which they are subjected, such that their surface is not fissured or torn.<br>
The thermoplastic excipient can advantageously be chosen from partially hydrogenated oils, beeswax, carnauba wax, paraffin waxes, silicone waxes, C12-C18 fatty alcohols and fatty acids, solid, semi-synthetic glycerides, glycerol monoesters, diesters or triesters, polyoxyethylene glycols, glycosylated polyoxyethylenated glycerides, and one of the mixtures thereof.<br>
The layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient is coated with a flexible and deformable film, comprising a polymer material, whose glass transition temperature is less than about 30°C, preferably less than about 20°C.<br>
The polymer film comprises a polymer material<br><br>
which is either a polymer or a mixture of at least one polymer and a plasticizer.<br>
The polymer film can serve, depending on the case, to protect the tiagabine from the environment (degradation by light, by ambient moisture), to mask the taste of the active principle or to modify its release (prolonged, delayed or programmed release).<br>
The polymer is preferably an acrylic, vinyl or cellulose polymer or copolymer.<br>
The term plasticizer is understood to refer to a product which lowers the glass transition temperature of the polymer.<br>
The plasticizer is preferably chosen from tri-ethyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triacetin, diethyl phthalate, polyethylene glycols, polysorbates, mono- and diacetyla-ted glycerides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The mechanical properties of the polymer film, in particular the percentage of elongation and the breaking strength, can serve as selection criteria for the polymer and/or the plasticizer. These mechanical properties can also be determined by the method described in standards DIN53 455 and ISO/RI 184.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a polymer or a polymer/plasticizer mixture having a percentage of elongation of greater than about 50% is preferably chosen, in order to coat spheroids intended to be compressed.<br>
For example, the polymer Eudragit NE30D® sold by the company Rohm, which is a neutral copolymer of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters in the form of an aqueous 30% dispersion, has a percentage of elongation of 600% and a breaking strength equal to 8 N/mm2, which makes it particularly flexible and deformable.<br>
According to a first variant of the invention, the tiagabine is dispersed in the bulk of the core.<br>
According to a second variant, the tiagabine is dispersed in the layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient.<br><br>
According to a third variant, the active principle is applied to the surface of the core and then coated with a layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient.<br>
Lastly, according to a fourth and final variant, the tiagabine is dispersed in the bulk of the core and in the layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient.<br>
The active principle can be protected, in one of the above four variants, by combining it with an anti-oxidant and/or by coating it with a protective film.<br>
The spheroids according to the invention can advantageously be coated with a water-dispersible outer layer.<br>
The outer layer provides the said spheroids with cohesion during a possible compression step, and ensures that the tablet obtained breaks down in aqueous medium.<br>
The water-dispersible outer layer preferably consists of an acrylic, vinyl or cellulose polymer.<br>
The subject of the present invention is also the process for the preparation of the spheroids described above.<br>
The cores can be manufactured by assembly in a turbomixer from calibrated sucrose crystals, or by extrusion-spheronization.<br>
When the cores are prepared by extrusion-spheronization, the tiagabine can be mixed into the extruded-spheronized bulk.<br>
According to the preparation process of the invention, the layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient, the film containing a polymer material, and optionally the outer protective layer, are successively deposited on the cores by spraying, in a granulating turbomixer, in a perforated turbomixer, in a fluidized-air bed, or by any other appropriate means.<br>
The process according to the invention comprises two or three steps depending on whether it is desired to prepare spheroids containing an outer layer which is water-dispersible, or otherwise.<br><br>
The spheroids containing a water-dispersible outer layer are particularly suitable for the preparation of tablets.<br>
The first step, known as the assembly step, consists in depositing the thermoplastic excipient(s) onto the cores. The assembly preparation can, depending on the case, be in the form of solid dispersions in aqueous or organic media, in the form of solutions, in the form of emulsions or in the molten state.<br>
When the tiagabine is dispersed in the bulk of the layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient, the active principle is incorporated into the assembly preparation.<br>
According to another variant of the process according to the invention, the active principle can be bound by dusting onto the neutral cores premoistened with the assembly preparation.<br>
According to other embodiments, the tiagabine can be dispersed in the bulk of the core or both in the bulk of the core and in that of the layer containing at least one thermoplastic excipient.<br>
The second step of the process according to the invention consists in depositing the polymer film which allows protection of the active principle, masking of the taste, or modified and controlled release of the active principle. The polymer coating preparation can be in the form of solutions or dispersions in aqueous or organic medium.<br>
The third optional step of the process according to the invention consists in depositing the protective outer layer by spraying the coating preparation, which can be in the form of a solution or dispersion in aqueous or organic medium.<br>
It is advantageously possible, as need be, to add an anti-adhesive agent such as talc, a plasticizer such as polyethylene glycol, and an antioxidant such as dl-a-tocopherol to the coating and assembly preparations.<br>
It is advantageously possible to add a disintegrating agent to the protective outer layer so as to<br><br>
accelerate the release  of  the  spheroids in aqueous medium, when these have been tabletted.<br>
The disintegrating agent is, for example, cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose, crosslinked polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or sodium carboxymethyl starch.<br>
The subject of the present invention is also multiparticulate pharmaceutical preparations containing the spheroids described above, which can be obtained by the process of the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention each preferably contain a unit dose of between 0.5 and 100 mg of tiagabine and are administered daily.<br>
The multiparticulate pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are preferably in the form of gelatin capsules filled with the said spheroids, or tablets of the said spheroids.<br>
The said tablets are advantageously prepared without the substantial addition of auxiliary substances. Before compression, up to 5% by weight of a lubricant such as talc can be added to the spheroids.<br>
The said tablets advantageously comprise spheroids protected by a water-dispersible layer consisting of an acrylic, vinyl or cellulose polymer or a water-dispersible thermoplastic excipient, or any other excipient which is soluble in aqueous medium.<br>
This layer has the role of ensuring cohesion between the spheroids, of thereby ensuring the hardness of the tablet, and of allowing the tablet to disintegrate when it is immersed in solution.<br>
The tablets according to the invention are dispersible in solution and yield independent spheroids, such that the release profile of the tablet and of the spheroids which constitute it are virtually equivalent.<br>
The reason for this is that the tablets according to the invention allow the delivery of spheroids without adversely affecting the release profile of the tiagabine they contain under the effect of the compression.<br>
The tablets according to the invention can be composed solely of spheroids according to the invention,<br><br>
or of a mixture of spheroids according to the invention and of placebo spheroids, that is to say spheroids in accordance with the present invention but lacking the active principle.<br>
The stresses exerted on the spheroids, during the compression step, can range from 5 kN to 50 kN, preferably between 5 kN and 15 kN.<br>
The hardness of the tablets is preferably between 10 N and 100 N, more preferably between 10 N and 50 N.<br>
The disintegration time of the tablets in aqueous medium at 37°C is less than 60 min.<br>
The tablets according to the invention preferably have a mass of between 0.1 g and 1 g.<br>
They may be round, oval or oblong in shape, they may have a flat or concave surface and may have cleaving grooves or bars.<br>
The tablets according to the invention can be subjected to a final protective or colouring coating operation.<br>
Lastly, the subject of the present invention is the use of a pharmaceutical preparation described above, for the manufacture of a medicinal product which is useful for treating epilepsy, the said medicinal product preferably being in the form of a tablet.<br>
The present invention will be described more particularly with the aid of the examples which follow and of the single figure, which should not be considered as limiting the invention.<br>
The single figure represents the percentage by mass of in-vitro dissolution of tiagabine for the non-compressed spheroids according to the invention (curve 1) and for a tablet of spheroids according to the invention (curve 2).<br><br>
