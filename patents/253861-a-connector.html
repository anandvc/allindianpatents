				<td>A Connector<br>
The present invention relates to a connector.<br>
A connector provided with a front retainer is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-166608. This connector is constructed such that a front retainer made of a synthetic resin is mounted from front into a housing made of a synthetic resin and adapted to accommodate terminal fittings. The front retainer is formed with a pair of locking arms projecting backward and temporarily held at a partial locking position by the engagement of the locking arms with the outer side surfaces of the housing. At the partial locking position, the terminal fittings can be inserted into and withdrawn from the housing. When the front retainer at the partial locking position is pushed toward the housing and moved to a full locking position, the terminal fittings in the housing are retained by the front retainer.<br>
The locking arms are engaged with the outer side surfaces of the housing as means for holding the front retainer at the partial locking position in the above connector. Generally, a molded article made of a synthetic resin is deformed due to a thermal shrinkage as the resin is cured. This, in the above connector, there is a possibility of reducing an area of engagement between the front retainer and the housing by the influence of the deformation resulting from the thermal shrinkage. In other words, if the locking arms are deformed outward to widen the spacing therebetween, they come to be separated from the outer side surfaces of the housing, wherefore the area of engagement is reduced.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation, and an object thereof is to reliably hold a front retainer locked.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claim. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector, comprising:<br>
a housing made of a resin and including at least one cavity for at least partly accommodating at least one terminal fitting, and<br>
a front retainer made of a resin and adapted to retain the terminal fitting upon being mounted in a substantially proper position onto or into the housing particularly from front or in or on a front part thereof,<br>
wherein:<br>
the front retainer includes a front wall, and at least one locking arm projecting substantially backward from the front wall and formed with an engaging portion, and<br>
the housing is formed with at least one insertion space into which the locking arm is at least partly insertable particularly from front, at least one lock portion for holding the front retainer mounted in or on the housing by being engaged with the engaging portion being formed on a wall surface of the insertion space to face the locking arm substantially in a direction of thermal deformation resulting from the molding of the locking arm.<br>
The locking arm is inserted in the insertion space formed in the housing when the front retainer is mounted in or at the substantially proper position in the housing. The front retainer is retained in or on the housing by the<br>
engagement of the engaging portion of the locking arm with the lock portion of the insertion space, The lock portion is arranged on the wall surface of the insertion space to face the locking arm substantially in a deforming direction when the locking arm is expected to be deformed due to a thermal shrinkage after the front retainer is molded. Thus, even if the locking arm is deformed during the molding, there is no likelihood of reducing an area of engagement between the lock portion and the engaging portion. Further, since engaged parts of the engaging portion and the lock portion are at least partly accommodated in the insertion space, there is no likelihood of unlocking the front retainer by the interference of an external matter from the outside.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the front retainer can be selectively held at a partial locking position and a full locking position in the housing, wherein the insertion and withdrawal of the terminal fitting into and from the housing are permitted when the front retainer is held at the partial locking position, and wherein the withdrawal of the terminal fitting at least partly inserted in the housing is prevented when the front retainer is held at the full locking position.<br>
Preferably, the front retainer includes a pair of locking arms, each locking arm having the engaging portion formed on an outer surface thereof,<br>
Further preferably, the housing is formed with a pair of insertion spaces into which the corresponding locking arms are at least partly insertable.<br>
Still further preferably, a partial lock portion for holding the front retainer at the partial locking position by being engaged with the corresponding engaging portion and a full lock portion for holding the front retainer at the full<br>
locking position by being engaged with the corresponding engaging portion are formed on an outer wall surface of preferably each insertion space.<br>
Most preferably, the front retainer can be selectively held at a partial locking position and a full locking position in the housing,<br>
the insertion and withdrawal of the terminal fitting into and from the housing are permitted when the front retainer is held at the partial locking position,<br>
the withdrawal of the terminal fitting inserted in the housing is prevented when the front retainer is held at the full locking position,<br>
the front retainer includes a pair of locking arms, each locking arm having the engaging portion formed on an outer surface thereof,<br>
the housing is formed with a pair of insertion spaces into which the corresponding locking arms are insertable, and<br>
a partial lock portion for holding the front retainer at the partial locking position by being engaged with the corresponding engaging portion and a full lock portion for holding the front retainer at the full locking position by being engaged with the corresponding engaging portion are formed on an outer wall surface of each insertion space.<br>
The engaging portions formed on the outer surfaces of the locking arms are engaged with the partial lock portions or the full lock portions with the front retainer held at the partial locking position or at the full locking position. Thus, even if the locking arms are deformed to widen the spacing therebetween due to the thermal shrinkage during the resin-molding, neither areas of engagement<br>
between the engaging portions and the partial lock portion nor those between the engaging portions and the full lock portions are reduced.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the front retainer is formed with at least one side wall substantially continuous with and at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles to both the front wall and the locking arm.<br>
Preferably, the side wall is formed with at least one retaining portion for retaining the at least one terminal fitting.<br>
Most preferably, the front retainer is formed with a side wall continuous with and substantially at right angles to both the front wall and the locking arm, and<br>
the side wall is formed with a retaining portion for retaining the terminal fitting.<br>
The locking arm is difficult to deform since the side wall is formed to be continuous with and substantially at right angles to both the front wall and the locking arm. Further, since the side wall also functions as means for retaining the terminal fitting, the shape of the front retainer can be simplified as compared to the case where exclusive means is formed to prevent the deformation of the locking arm.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one recess for at least partly accommodating the front wall when the front retainer is mounted in the substantially proper position into the housing is formed in the front surface of the housing.<br>
Preferably, error mounting preventing portions engageable with each other only when the front retainer is mounted in a substantially proper orientation into the housing are formed at or near the opening edge of the recess and/or the outer peripheral edge of the front wall.<br>
Most preferably, a recess for accommodating the front wall when the front retainer is mounted in the proper position into the housing is formed in the front surface of the housing, and<br>
error mounting preventing portions engageable with each other only when the front retainer is mounted in a proper orientation into the housing are formed at the opening edge of the recess and the outer peripheral edge of the front wall.<br>
Since the error mounting preventing portions are formed at the recess in the front surface of the housing and at the front wall, the front retainer can be prevented from being mounted in an improper orientation into the housing.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings. It should be understood that even though embodiments are separately described, single features thereof may be combined to additional embodiments.<br>

FIG. 4 is a front view of a housing,<br>
FIG. 5 is a front view of the front retainer,<br>
FIG. 6 is a side view of the front retainer, and<br>
FIG. 7 is a bottom view of the front retainer.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 7. A connector of this embodiment is provided with a housing 10 made e.g. of a synthetic resin, one or more terminal fittings 20 and a front retainer 30 made e.g. of a synthetic resin to be mounted on the housing 10 substantially from front or on or into a front portion thereof. A connecting side with an unillustrated mating connector is referred to as front side.<br>
The housing 10 preferably is substantially in the form of a vertically long block as a whole, one or more, preferably a plurality of cavities 11 penetrate the housing 10 while making respective openings in the front and rear surfaces of the housing 10, and the one or more female terminal fittings 20 are at least partly inserted into the respective cavities 11 from an insertion side, preferably substantially from behind (right side in FIGS, 1 to 3). A locking portion 12 extending substantially along an inner wall is formed in each cavity 11, and the terminal fitting 20 at least partly inserted into the cavity 11 is engaged with the locking portion 12 to be retained. The locking portion 12 is resiliency deformed at an intermediate stage of the insertion of the terminal fitting 20, and a deformation space 13 for permitting the resilient deformation of the locking portion 12 preferably makes an opening in the front surface of the housing 10.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (upper and/or lower) symmetric insertion spaces 14 are formed in the housing 10. The insertion space(s) 14 is/are formed at a position outside of or above the plurality of cavities 11 and/or at a position outside of or below the plurality of cavities 11, i.e. are formed to extend substantially along the lateral (upper and/or lower) wall(s) of the housing 10, and penetrate the housing 10 while making openings in the front and rear surfaces of the housing 10. A partial lock portion 15 projecting downward or inward from a position close to the front end of the insertion space 14 and a common lock portion 16 (corresponding to the partial lock portion 15 and a full lock portion) projecting inward or downward at a position behind the partial lock portion 15 are formed on the lateral or ceiling wall of the lateral or upper insertion space 14. On the other hand, a partial lock portion 15 projecting upward or inward from a position close to the front end of the insertion space 14 and a common lock portion 16 (corresponding to the partial lock portion 15 and a full lock portion) projecting upward or inward at a position behind the partial lock portion 15 are formed on the lateral or bottom wall of the upper insertion space 14.<br>
A recess 17 for at least partly accommodating a front wall 31 of the front retainer 30 to be described later is formed in or at the front surface of the housing 10. The recess 17 is formed to include a formation area of the locking portions 12, a formation area of the deformation spaces 13 and formation areas of the upper and lower insertion spaces 14, and preferably is vertically long as a whole. A lateral side of the opening edge of the recess 17 substantially opposite to the cavities 11 is cut off substantially over at least part of, preferably<br>
over the substantially entire length except the upper and bottom ends to form an error mounting preventing portion 18.<br>
The front retainer 30 is an integral or unitary assembly of the front wall 31 to be mounted and placed on the front surface of the housing 10, one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (upper and/or lower, preferably symmetric) locking arms 36 substantially in the form of cantilevers projecting backward from the lateral (upper and/or lower) edge(s) of the front wall 31 or from near thereto, and a side wall 34 bulging out backward from one lateral edge of the front wall 31. The front retainer 30 is selectively held at a partial locking position (as a preferred first position) and a full locking position (as a preferred second position) by being mounted into the housing 10 substantially from front or at the front.<br>
The front wall 31 is at least partly fitted into the recess 17 when the front retainer 30 is held at the full locking position (second position). Further, an error mounting preventing portion 32 preferably substantially in the form of a rib projecting sideways and engageable with the error mounting preventing portion 18 of the recess 17 of the housing 10 is formed at or near the lateral edge of the front wall 31 where the side wall 34 bulges out. On the other hand, the lateral edge of the front wall 31 substantially opposite to the side wall 34 is cut out or recessed at positions corresponding to the locking portions 12 and the openings of the deformation spaces 13, thereby forming escaping portions 33.<br>
The side wall 34 is substantially continuous with and at an angle different from 0' or 180°, preferably substantially at a right angle to the front wall 31, and is at least partly located in the deformation spaces 13 of the housing 10 when<br>
the front retainer 30 is at the full locking position (second position). One or more (preferably substantially rib-shaped) retaining portions 35 for preventing resilient deformations of the locking portions 12 toward the deformation spaces 13 (in a direction away from the terminal fittings 20) by coming substantially into contact with the locking portions 12 when the front retainer 30 is located at the full locking position (second position) are formed on the inner surface of the side wall 34. Since the retaining portions 35 do not interfere with the locking portions<br>
12	when the front retainer 30 is at the partial locking position (first position), the<br>
resilient deformations of the locking portions 12 toward the deformation spaces<br>
13	are permitted. Further, the upper and bottom end edges of the side wall 34<br>
are substantially continuous with and at an angle different from Oe or 180",<br>
preferably substantially at right angles to a lateral edge of the upper locking arm<br>
36 and that of the lower locking arm 36.<br>
The locking arms 36 preferably are substantially in the form of plates at an angle different from Oe or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles to the front wall 31 and the side wall 34 as a whole, and rear end parts of the locking arms 36 project further backward from the rear end of the side wall 34. These projecting parts of the locking arms 36 serve as resilient deforming portions 37 resiliency deformable upward and downward (along the thickness direction TD of the locking arms 36) with the front ends (parts continuous with the rear end of the side wall 34) as supporting points. The thickness of each locking arm 36 including the resilient deforming portion 37 preferably is substantially constant and/or smaller than the height of the insertion space 14. An engaging portion 38 projecting outward or upward is formed on the resilient deforming portion 37<br>
of the upper locking arm 36, whereas an engaging portion 38 projecting outward or downward is formed on the resilient deforming portion 37 of the lower locking arm 36, Further, one or more, preferably a pair of guide ribs 39 are formed on the upper surface of the upper locking arm 36 to project along the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral (left and/or right) edge(s) of this upper surface, and the upper surfaces of the guide ribs 39 and that of the corresponding engaging portion 38 preferably are substantially continuous and flush with each other. On the other hand, one or more, preferably a pair of guide ribs 39 are also formed on the lower surface of the tower locking arm 36 to project substantially along the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral (left and/or right) edge(s) of this upper surface, and the lower surfaces of the guide ribs 39 and that of the corresponding engaging portion 38 preferably are substantially continuous and flush with each other.<br>
The front retainer 30 thermally shrinks after being molded in this embodiment. The locking arms 36 tend to be deformed outward to widen the spacing therebetween as the front retainer 30 thermally shrinks.<br>
Upon mounting the front retainer 30 into the housing 10, the front retainer 30 is brought closer to the housing 10 from front and preferably both upper and lower locking arms 36 are at least partly inserted into the respective insertion spaces 14. At this time, the one or more guide ribs 39 come substantially into sliding contact with the surfaces of the insertion spaces 14 where the partial lock portions 15 and the common lock portions 16 are formed, whereby the front retainer 30 is guided so as not to vertically move relative to the housing 10. When the locking arms 36 are at least partly inserted, the<br>
engaging portions 38 interfere with the partial lock portions 15, wherefore the resilient deforming portion 37 of the upper locking arm 36 is resiliently deformed inward or downward and the resilient deforming portion 37 of the lower locking arm 36 is resiliently deformed inward or upward. In other words, the upper and lower resilient deforming portions 37 are resiliently deformed substantially toward each other, and the engaging portions 38 pass the partial lock portions 15 by the resilient deformations of the resilient deforming portions 37.<br>
When the engaging portions 38 completely pass the partial lock portions 15, the upper and lower resilient deforming portions 37 are resiliently restored to at least partly fit the engaging portions 38 between the partial lock portions 15 and the common lock portions 16, whereby the front retainer 30 is held or positioned at the partial locking position (first position) in the housing 10. At this time, since the side wall 34 is only lightly fitted into the deformation spaces 13, the resilient deformations of the locking portions 12 are permitted. Further, the front wall 31 is distanced forward from the front surface (recess 17) of the housing 10. In this partly locked state, the terminal fittings 20 are at least partly inserted into the cavities 11 from the inserting side, preferably substantially from behind.<br>
After the at least partial insertion of all the terminal fittings 20 is completed, the front wall 31 is pushed or operated to move the front retainer 30 from the partial locking position (first position) towards or to the full locking position (second position). During this movement, the engaging portions 38 interfere with the common lock portions 16 to resiliently deform the upper and<br>
lower resilient deforming portions 37, thereby enabling the engaging portions 38 to pass the common lock portions 16,<br>
When the engaging portions 38 completely pass the common lock portions 16, the upper and lower resilient deforming portions 37 are resiliency at least partly restored and the engaging portions 38 are engaged with the common lock portions 16 preferably from behind, whereby a returning movement of the front retainer 30 toward the partial locking position (first position) is prevented. Further, the front wall 31 is at least partly fitted into the recess 17 to come into contact with the front surface of the housing 10, thereby preventing any further backward movement of the front retainer 30. In this way, the front retainer 30 is held or positioned at the full locking position in the housing 10. in this state, the side wall 34 is deeply inserted in the deformation spaces 13 and the locking portions 12 are prevented from undergoing resilient deformations in the direction away from the terminal fittings 20 by the retaining portions 35, wherefore the terminal fittings 20 are reliably retained while being doubly locked.<br>
If the front retainer 30 is mounted in an improper orientation (i.e. in an upside-down orientation) into the housing 10, the locking arms 36 can be at least partly inserted into the insertion spaces 14 at an initial stage of the mounting operation. However, when the front retainer 30 is moved from the partial locking position towards or to the full locking position, the error mounting preventing portion 32 of the front retainer 30 comes substantially into contact with a part of the front surface of the housing 10 where the recess 17 is not formed immediately before the full locking position is reached, thereby<br>
preventing any further movement of the front retainer 30. In other words, the front retainer 30 cannot be mounted at or moved to the full locking position (second position) if being held in the improper posture. Contrary to this, if the front retainer 30 is mounted in a substantially proper posture, the error mounting preventing portion 32 of the front retainer 30 is engaged with the error mounting preventing portion 32 of the housing 10, wherefore the front retainer 30 can be moved to the full locking position.<br>
Upon withdrawing the terminal fitting 20, the front retainer 30 may be returned from the full locking position (second position) towards or to the partial locking position (first position), an unillustrated jig may be at least partly inserted into the housing 10 through the escaping portion 33 of the front retainer 30 in this state, and the terminal fitting 20 may be pulled backward with the locking portion 12 resiliently deformed toward the deformation space 13 using this jig.<br>
According to this embodiment, the engaging portions 38 formed on the outer surfaces of the locking arms 36 are engaged with the partial lock portions 15 or the common lock portions 16 when the front retainer 30 is held at the partial locking position or at the full locking position. Thus, even if the locking arms 36 are deformed to widen the spacing therebetween due to the thermal shrinkage when the front retainer 30 is resin-molded, neither areas of engagement between the engaging portions 38 and the partial lock portions 15 nor those between the engaging portions 38 and the common lock portions are reduced. Further, since the engaged parts of the engaging portions 38 and the partial lock portions 15 and those of the engaging portions 38 and the common<br>
lock portions 16 are at least partly accommodated in the insertion spaces 14, there is no likelihood of unlocking the front retainer 30 by the interference of an external matter from the outside.<br>
Since the side wall 34 is formed to be substantially continuous with and at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles to both the front wall 31 and the locking arms 36, the locking arms 36 are more difficult to deform. In other words, the side wall 34 functions as means for preventing the deformations of the locking arms 36. Further, since the side wall 34 is formed with the retaining portions 35 and also functions as means for retaining the terminal fittings 20, the shape of the front retainer 30 can be simplified as compared to the case where exclusive means is formed to prevent the deformations of the locking arms 36.<br>
The recess 17 for at least partly accommodating the front wall 31 when the front retainer 30 is at the full locking position (second position) is formed in the front surface of the housing 10 and the error mounting preventing portions 18, 32 engageable with each other only when the front retainer 30 is mounted in the proper orientation into the housing 10 are formed at the opening edge of the recess 17 and the outer peripheral edge of the front wall 31. This can prevent the front retainer 30 from being mounted in an improper orientation into the housing 10<br>
Accordingly, to enable a front retainer to be reliably held in a locked state, with a front retainer 30 held at first or second positions or a partial or full locking position, one or more engaging portions 38 formed on outer surfaces of locking arms 36 are engaged with one or more partial lock portions 15 or or<br>
more common lock portions 16 (partial lock portions, full lock portions). Thus, even if one or more resilient deforming portions 37 of the locking arms 36 are deformed particularly to widen the spacing therebetween due to a thermal shrinkage at the time of resin-molding, neither areas of engagement of the engaging portions 38 and the partial lock portions 15 nor those of the engaging portions 38 and the common lock portions 16 are reduced. Further, engaged parts of the engaging portions 38 and the partial lock portions 15 and those of the engaging portions 38 and the common lock portions 16 are accommodated in insertion spaces 14, there is no likelihood of unlocking the front retainer 30 by the interference of an external matter from the outside. <br><other embodiments><br>

We claim:<br>
1.	A connector, comprising:<br>
a housing (10) made of a resin and including at least one cavity (11) for<br>
accommodating at least one terminal fitting (20),<br>
a resiliently deformable lock projecting into the cavity and a deformation space<br>
being defined on a side of the lock opposite the cavity, the lock being deformable<br>
into the deformation space during insertion of the terminal fitting (20) into the<br>
cavity and resiliently returning towards the cavity (11) for engaging the terminal<br>
fitting (20) that has been inserted into the cavity; and<br>
a front retainer (30) made of a resin and having a side wall insertable into the<br>
deformation space to prevent deformation on the lock away from the terminal<br>
fitting (20) to retain the terminal fitting (20) upon being mounted to a proper<br>
position on the housing (10);<br>
characterized in that:<br>
the front retainer (30) includes a front wall, at least one locking arm projecting<br>
back from the front wall and formed with an engaging portion (38) and the<br>
housing (10); having at least one insertion space for receiving the locking arm<br>
(31), at least one lock being formed on a wall surface of the insertion space (14) to<br>
face the locking arm substantially in a direction of thermal deformation resulting<br>
from the molding of the locking arm (31), the lock being configured for engaging<br>
the engaging portion and holding the front retainer on the housing.<br>
2.	A connector as claimed in claim 1, wherein:<br>
the front retainer (30) can be selectively held at a partial locking position and a full locking position in the housing (10),<br>
the insertion and withdrawal of the terminal fitting (26) into and from the housing<br>
(10) are permitted when the front retainer (30) is held at the partial locking<br>
position,<br>
the withdrawal of the terminal fitting (20) at least partly inserted in the housing<br>
(10) is prevented when the front retainer (30) is held at the full locking position.<br>
3.	A connector as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, wherein the front retainer (30) includes a pair of locking arms (36), each locking arm (36) having the engaging portion (38) formed on an outer surface thereof.<br>
4.	A connector as claimed in claim 3, wherein the housing (10) is formed with a pair of insertion spaces (14) into which the corresponding locking arms (36) are at least partly insertable.<br>
5.	A connector as claimed in claim 4, wherein a partial lock portion (15) for holding the front retainer (30) at the partial locking position by being engaged with the corresponding engaging portion (38) and a full lock portion (16) for holding the front retainer (30) at the full locking position by being engaged with the corresponding engaging portion (38) are formed on an outer wall surface of preferably each insertion space (14).<br>
6.	A connector as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, wherein the front retainer (30) is formed with at least one side wall (34) substantially continuous with and at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles to both the front wall (31) and the locking arm (36).<br>
7.	A connector as claimed in claim 6, wherein the side wall (34) is formed with at least one retaining portion (35) for retaining the at least one terminal fitting (20).<br>
8.	A connector as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, wherein at least one recess (17) for at least partly accommodating the front wall (31) when the front retainer (30) is mounted in the substantially proper position into the housing (10) is formed in the front surface of the housing (10).<br>
9.	A connector as claimed in claim 8, wherein error mounting preventing portions (18) engageable with each other only when the front retainer (30) is mounted in a substantially proper orientation into the housing (10) are formed at or near the opening edge of the recess (17) and/or the outer peripheral edge of the front wall</other></td>
