				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates, in general, to the mobile communication devices. Particularly, the present invention relates to the security of mobile communication device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for tracking a mobile communication device using MMS.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Mobile communications is now a days becoming an establishing force for social and economic development. The security of the mobile communication devices is a significant factor in the present scenario.<br>
The existing art involves tracking of mobile phones by a method with which it detects possible misuse (when the phone is stolen and SIM / USIM replaced), and reports it by itself to the actual owner through SMS, MMS or email, without the network making queries. Referring to figure 1 it shows the identity check procedure used in ,the prior 91I. The SGSN or MSC sends Identity Request (Identity Type) to the MS and in response to that the MS sends the Identity Response (Mobile Identity). If the SGSN or MSC decides to check the IMEI against the EIR, it sends Check IMEI (IMEI) to EIR. The EIR responds with Check IMEI Ack (IMEI).<br><br>
Another patent application titled "A method of tracking stolen mobile device" discloses a method for tracking of electronic devices which use a removable user identity card comprising the steps of: providing a menu option for inputting a password, destination email-id/phone and a customized message contents for sending the alert SMS/email when the user activates the tracking control operation in the electronic device; inputting a password, destination email-id/phone and a customized message contents for sending the alert SMS/email; storing the user-authentication information for accessing the alert-SMS/email feature, the destination email/phone, and any predefined text to be sent in NVRAM; comparing the IMSI stored in the NVRAM with the new IMSI whenever a new user identity card is inserted once the tracking control feature is successfully activated; and sending an alert-SMS/email to the predefined destination if there is a mismatch between the IMSI stored in the NVRAM and the said new IMSI along with the current location information of the device if available. However the method does not provide means for sending MMS.<br>
In another Japanese patent titled, "Mobile phone", it describes a method of mobile tracking wherein the possessor of the mobile phone transmits electronic mail including a command character string set in advance to the mobile phone. Thus, the mobile phone shifts into a tracing mode, and automatically transmits positional information of a present registration base station and a photographed image by an attached camera under an ordinary waiting display to a preset electronic mail address. After that, the mobile phone periodically automatically transmits the information above and history information such as calls from the mobile phone by<br><br>
each time by the setting of a mobile phone built-in timer. Further, the mobile phone replaces personal information data in a telephone directory with fictional data and displays the fictional data. Moreover, the mobile phone interrupts its speech after a prescribed time.<br>
Another patent titled, "Mobile telephone with camera has anti-theft- and personal security system which takes and transmits pictures rapidly to telephone number stored in memory", describes a mobile telephone having a camera that is either integrated or stuck on the housing. It features a snapshot function and a high-speed transfer function for transferring the captured picture, the series of pictures or the video sequence to a node within a domain or network, e.g., a home PC or the Internet. The publication suggests the use of SIP for initiating, modifying and ending sessions between nodes and the use of Mobile IP when there is an increase in the mobility rate of the various nodes. However, the publication suggests the mobile telephone use for crime prevention, and not on the basis of IMSI number comparison of SIM card. For example, the mobile telephone can automatically activate the functionality when a person carrying the device is being dominated by a criminal via pressure sensitive keys/areas on the device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposed invention generally relates to the mobile technology and in particular to a method and system for tracking a lost or a stolen mobile phone device through MMS. The mobile phone device includes a functionality to store<br><br>
one or more contact numbers or email addresses. When the mobile phone device is lost / stolen, and the person changes the SIM card, the phone verifies if the SIM card is the same as that of the owner by matching the IMSI numbers of the two. If there is a mismatch, the phone triggers the tracking feature. The tracking feature stealthily captures still images or video snapshots and transfers those captured images/videos to the pre-stored contact numbers through Multi-media messaging Service (MMS) or sending the images/videos to the pre-stored email addresses.<br>
The object of the proposed invention is to invent a new method for tracking any mobile phone device using MMS without the network making queries, which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to track stolen mobile phones or laptops or any mobile communicatibn device "which supports network connectivity, by making it automatically send SMS/MMS/Email to preset destination, if the proposed Tracking feature in the device is turned on, whenever SIM / USIM card is changed or powered up with a SIM / USIM card different from that of the user who activated Tracking feature, or Laptop/device is connected to a network after power-up.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for tracking the communication device without any extra efforts from the user/operator to track it.<br><br>
It is yet another object of the proposed invention to provide a method which does not depend on the presence of EIR in the network, providing very efficient and fast way of tracking, compared to the network querying IMEI of all users which still does not guarantee any results.<br>
The invention proposes a method by which the mobile or the electronic device initiates the camera application (stealthily without showing Preview on Display) and clicks a few pictures or records a short Video clip (configurable, depending on available memory in the device). These pictures will be sent to the number stored in the Phone (by the Original user) using Multimedia Message Service (MMS) or Email. The assumption is that at least GPRS/3G services are available (in case of mobile phones) is subscribed to enable sending the pictures stealthily. MMS is used to supplement sending the thiefs pictures or surroundings, apart from sending basic information (of thief) through SMS.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for tracking electronic communication devices which use removable identity card comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing a menu option for inputting a password, destination email-<br>
id/phone and a customized message contents for sending the alert MMS<br>
when the user activates the tracking control operation;<br>
(b)	inputting a password, destination email-id / phone and a customized<br>
message contents for sending the alert MMS;<br>
(c)	storing the user-authentication information for accessing the alert MMS<br><br>
feature, the destination email/phone, and any predefined text to be sent in NVRAM, along with the identity and Tracking Control feature-activation status;<br>
(d)	comparing   the  identity  stored   in  the  NVRAM  with  the  new  identity<br>
whenever a new identity card is inserted once the tracking control feature<br>
is successfully activated;<br>
(e)	capturing still images or video if there is a mismatch between the identity<br>
stored in the NVRAM and the said new identity; and<br>
(f)	transferring the captured images/videos to the pre-stored contact numbers<br>
through    Multi-media    messaging    Service    (MMS)    or   sending    the<br>
images/videos to the pre-stored email addresses along with the current<br>
location information of the device if available.<br>
The device provides a menu option with password (Tracking Control Key) protection. The said Tracking Control Key is used to turn on / off the said tracking feature and for editing the destination email-id / phone. The said Tracking Control Key is used for editing the message content associated with the MMS. When the user tries to activate the tracking feature, the user is prompted for the Tracking Control Key. To access/change the alert-message destination and the customizable contents, the user has to input the Tracking Control Key.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for tracking electronic communication devices which use removable identity card comprising:<br>
(a) means for inputting a. password,  destination. email-id / phone and a<br><br>
customized message contents for sending the alert MMS when the user activates the tracking control operation;<br>
(b)	memory for storing the user-authentication information for accessing the<br>
alert MMS feature, the destination email/phone, and any predefined text to<br>
be sent, along with the identity and Tracking Control feature-activation<br>
status;<br>
(c)	means for comparing    the identity stored in the NVRAM with the new<br>
identity whenever a new identity card is inserted once the tracking control<br>
feature is successfully activated;<br>
(d)	means for capturing still images or video if there is a mismatch between<br>
the identity stored in the NVRAM and the said new identity; and<br>
(e)	means for transferring the captured  images/videos to the pre-stored<br>
contact  numbers  through   Multi-media   messaging   Service  (MMS)   or<br>
sending the images/videos to the pre-stored email addresses along with<br>
the current location information of the device if available.<br>
The system includes a tracking Control Key authentication module which handles activation / deactivation of Tracking Control and accessing the customized information to be sent in the message. It includes a customization module which maintains the message format and content information and an identification info access module which gets the required info from the identity card , and detects the change of identity card. There is a Location Info Access module which gets the information about the current location of the device, if the user has opted for it to be sent in alert message and a Call Barring Status Check module which,<br><br>
periodically checks it the status is changed, for sending alert message if outgoing call is barred.<br>
The system also includes an Info Display module, which displays the current settings. It also includes network-access check module which triggers the alert message for devices which don't use identity card, when the device is connected to a network and a camera module for taking the pictures or video when a new identity card is inserted, as part of the MMS message to be sent to pre-defined destination. Also it has an. instant Messaging module, which has instant Messaging application.<br>
Later if the user wishes to access/change password, destination Email-id/phone and a customized message contents for sending the alert SMS/MMS/Email, the configured password has to be input by the user. In the alert-SMS/MMS/email, the location information and MSISDN/IMSI of the current user is included, in addition to customized message contents. The user-authentication information stored in the NVRAM is the IMSI of the current SIM / USIM card for a mobile phone supporting SIM / USIM card. If there is no SIM / USIM card, the user is prompted to insert SIM / USIM card. If the initial attempt to send SMS/email fails, the device keeps trying periodically or with increased delay after each attempt until successful where the said periodicity is configured in the mobile. If the SIM / USIM card of the new user has 'Outgoing Calls Barred' option already set, when the said card is inserted the mobile device sends the alert SMS/MMS/email when call barring is removed.<br><br>
For activation / deactivation of tracking control and for accessing the customization of the information to be sent in the message a TCK authentication module is provided in the mobile device. For maintaining the message format and content information a customization module is provided in the mobile device. To get the required information from SIM / USIM, like IMSI, call barring status, and detecting the change of SIM 7 USIM card a SIM/USIM info access module is provided in the mobile device. For getting the information about the current location of the device, if the user has opted for it to be sent in alert message a location info access module is provided in the mobile device. For periodically checking the status change and sending alert message when outgoing call is barred Call Barring Status Check module is provided in the mobile device. For displaying the current settings an info display module is provided in the mobile device. For taking pictures/video snapshots stealthily, a Camera module is provided in the mobije device.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br><br>
The proposed invention provides a method to track the Mobile Equipment (ME) by making the ME detect possible misuse (when the phone is stolen and SIM / USIM replaced, or if the device is not a phone, when the device accesses a network), and report it by itself to the actual owner, without the network making queries.<br>
Figure 2 shows the mobile electronic device that is the subject matter of patent application, for use in connection with a telecommunication network. The main focus of the invention relates to the operation of the Tracking Control feature, of which is explained in Fig 3.<br>
Whenever SIM / USIM card is changed or powered up with a different SIM / USIM card, make the device automatically send an alert-SMS/MMS/email to preset destination. The Device also initiates the camera application (stealthily without showing Preview on Display) and clicks a few pictures or records a short Video clip (configurable, depending on available memory). These pictures or clip will be sent to preset destination stored in the Device (by the Original user) using MMS or Email<br>
The device will provide a menu option with password (Tracking Control Key, TCK) protection<br>
□	to turn on/off this feature<br>
□	for editing the destination email-id/phone number<br>
□	for editing the user-defined part of the message contents for sending<br><br>
the alert SMS/MMS/Email The Tracking Control operation (shown in Fig 4.) involves the following steps:<br>
■	When the uster tries to' activate the feature, the user is prompted for a<br>
password (TCK).<br>
■	Then the user is prompted for the alert-message destination and optionally<br>
the customizable contents of the alert message. Once this is over, the<br>
Tracking Control gets activated. (Later if the user wishes to access/change<br>
any of these, TCK has to be input by the user.)<br>
■	In the alert-SMS/MMS/email, the Location Information, MSISDN/IMSI etc of<br>
the current user can be included, in addition to any user-defined text.<br>
■	The device initiates the Camera application (without showing display<br>
preview), and takes a few pictures or records a short video clip. The idea<br>
behind hidden preview is to not let the thief be aware that his/her actions<br>
are being recorded. This recording is dependant on the memory available<br>
in the device. These pictures or clip will be sent to preset destination stored<br>
in the Device (by the Original user) using MMS (can be sent if the SIM is<br>
supporting GPRS or 3G service. Alternately the picture or clip can be sent<br>
by Email.<br><br>
■	The user-authentication info for accessing the alert-SMS/MMS/email, the<br>
destination email/phone#, and any predefined text to be sent will be stored<br>
in NVRAM.<br>
■	When the feature gets activated as given above, for a device supporting<br>
SIM / USIM card, the IMSI of the current SIM / USIM card is stored in the<br>
NVRAM, or if there is no SIM / USIM card, user is prompted to insert SIM /<br>
USIM card.<br>
■	Once   Tracking   Control   feature   is   successfully  activated   as  above,<br>
whenever new SIM card is inserted, the device will compare the IMSI<br>
stored in the NVRAM with the new IMSI and if there is a mismatch, will<br>
send an alert-SMS/MMS/email to the destination which was specified by<br>
the owner. The current Location Information of the device (based on the<br>
Location Identity) as obtained from the Radio access technology (like<br>
GSM/UMTS/CDMA), will also be included in the message.<br>
■	If the initial attempt to send SMS/MMS/Email fails, the device keeps trying<br>
periodically until successful. This period can be configured.<br>
■	If the SIM / USIM card of the new user has 'Outgoing Calls Barred' option<br>
already set, when it is inserted, the device can remember that the SIM card<br>
was changed and can send the alert SMS/MMS later when Call barring is<br>
removed.<br><br>
For these operation', the Tracking Control module has the following sub-modules, as in Fig 3, with roles as mentioned below:<br>
TCK authentication module: Handles of activation/deactivation of Tracking Control and for accessing the customization of the information to be sent in the message.<br>
Customization module: Maintains the message format and content information.<br>
(SIM/USIM) Info access module: Gets the required info from SIM / USIM, like IMSI and Call barring status etc, and detects the change of SIM / USIM card.<br>
Location Info Access module: Gets the information about the current location information of the device, if the user has opted for it to be sent in alert message.<br>
Call Barring Status Check module: If Outgoing call is barred, periodically checks it the status is changed, for sending alert message.<br>
Info Display module: Displays the current settings.<br>
Network-access check module: For devices which don't use SIM card, this<br><br>
module triggers the alert SMS/MMS when the device is connected to a network.<br>
Camera module: For taking pictures or Video Clip stealthily whenever a new SIM/USIM Card, as part' of the MMS or Email to be sent to pre-defined destination.<br>
Fig 5. gives detailed sequence of events between various blocks of proposed feature, when the feature is triggered. The various steps involved in the process are as given below:<br>
a.	When the device is powered on the SIM/USIM information access<br>
module is invoked and it gets the required information from<br>
SIM/USIM, like IMSI and call barring status etc, and detects the<br>
change of SIM/USIM card.<br>
b.	If the track feature is enabled, the current IMSI value is retrieved<br>
from the SIM and compared with the NVRAM information wherein<br>
the   user-authentication   information   for   accessing   the   alert-<br>
SMS/MMS/email feature, the destination email/phone, and any<br>
predefined text to be sent is stored.<br>
c.	If IMSI from SIM is same as that stored in the NVRAM, the<br>
SIM/USIM information access module takes no action. Otherwise<br>
IMSI mismatch flag is set.<br>
d.	As soon as the mismatch flag is set, the system checks whether<br>
the registration has been successful or not. If it is not successful it<br>
waits till the registration status changes.<br><br>
e.	If the registration is successful the system checks whether the<br>
outgoing calls are barred. If it is barred then it waits until the call<br>
barring status changes. On change of call barring status it should<br>
be checked whether the track feature is enabled and I MSI<br>
mismatch flag is set.<br>
f.	If the user wanted to include location information, the location<br>
information   access   module   is   invoked   to   obtain   location<br>
information. The Camera module is initiated (without showing<br>
preview) in the display, and takes a few pictures or a video<br>
snapshot. Then an alert SMS/MMS/E-mail is sent to configured<br>
destination from tracking control module with all the relevant data.<br>
g.	If the user has specified both phone number and e-mail id, then<br>
both SMS, MMS and e-mail are sent and that too for multiple<br>
times to increase the reliability. Then the system checks whether<br>
secret SMS/MMS/E-mail has been send successfully or not.<br>
h. If it was successful the procedure can either end here or keep sending SMS/MMS/E-mail, with increasing delay between each attempt to increase reliability, and to ensure that the owner gets the theft related details.<br>
i. If the message was not send successfully a staggered periodic timer is initialized. On each expiry of the timer it tries to send an alert SMS/MMS/E-mail to configured destination from tracking control module with all relevant data and again if it is not successful increase the timer duration and restarts the timer and<br><br>
the process is repeated.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
