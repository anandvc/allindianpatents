' The present invention relates to a novel process for transforming crude halogenated copper phthalocyanine pigments having a chlorine content of from 4 to 50.3% by weight into a useful pigmentary state.<br>
The halogenation of copper phthalocyanine customarily produces amorphous to microcrystalline products which, owing to their pronounced tendency to agglomerate, have no utility for pigment applications.<br>
Various methods are known to transform crude pigments into a useful pigmentary state, for example mechanical comminution or treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid or with organic solvents at elevated temperature.<br>
The solvents used for treating polyhalogenated copper phthalocyanines are mainly xylene (DE-A-20 13 818), trichlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene or nitrobenzene (DE-A-24 49 231), 2-nitrophenol (DB-A-12 42 180), naphthol (GB-A-1 088 736), benzoic acid and/or alkylbenzoic acids (EP-A-58 888) or aliphatic ketones (DE-A 36 36 428) in the presence or absence of water. jp-A 336 556/1994 describes a process wherein polyhalogenated copper phthalocyanines are heated in mixtures of water and aromatic solvents in the presence of copper phthalocyanine derivatives; acidic solvents are not used.<br>
These known processes frequently provide only unsatisfactory results and, what is more, are limited to copper phthalocyanines having a high degree of halogenation (chlorine content &gt; 38.5% by weight, ie. at least 10 chlorine atoms on the CuPc structure).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process whereby not just polyhalogenated, but especially also crude incipiently halogenated (chlorine content 
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for transforming crude halogenated copper phthalocyanine pigments having a chlorine content of from 4 to 50.3% by weight into a useful pigmentary state, which comprises treating the crude<br><br>
pigment at elevated temperature with a liquid acidic aromatic organic medium in the presence of a copper phthalocyanine derivative selected from the group consisting of the copper phthalocyanine-sulfonic and -carboxylic acids and their alkali metal, ammonium and alkylammonium salts, the amino-substituted and aminomethylated copper phthalocyanines and their reaction products with alkylating agents, sulfonic acids, sulfonyl chlorides and carbonyl chlorides, the imidomethylene- and amidomethylene-substituted copper phthalocyanines, the alkyl-, aryl- and cyano-substituted copper phthalocyanines and the hydroxyl- and alkoxy-substituted copper phthalocyanines, if desired in the presence of water.<br>
The organic medium used is preferably a compound of the general formula I<br><br>
where X is hydroxyl or carboxyl and the benzene ring D may additionally bear up to two identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of nltro, Ci-C4-alkyl, preferably Ci-C2-alkyl, C2-C4-alkenyl, preferably C2-C3-alkenyl, chlorine and bromine and may be benzofused.<br>
when X is carboxyl ("solvent" based on benzoic acid), the benzene ring D is preferably substituted by an additional Ci-C^-alkyl, especially Ci-C2-alkyl, group or particularly preferably unsubstituted.<br>
When X is hydroxyl (phenolic "solvent"), the benzene ring D preferably bears one of the aforementioned substituents in addition; if the benzene ring D is benzofused, it preferably bears no further substituents.<br>
The organic medium should have little, if any, solubility in water at room temperature and should be liquid at the process temperature. The melting point of said compounds 1 should therefore generally be 
Examples of suitable acidic aromatic organic media are: benzoic acid, 2-, 3- and 4-methylbenzoic acid, 2-, 3- and 4-ethylbenzoic acid, phenol, 2-, 3- and 4-nitrophenol, 2-, 3- and 4-methylphenol (-cresol), 2-, 3- and 4-ethylphenol, 2-allylphenol, 2-, 3- and 4-bromophenol, 2,4-dibromophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2-chloro-6-nitrophenol, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol,<br><br>
2,4-dinitrophenol, 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol, 1- and 2-naphthol and l-bromo-2-naphthol and mixtures thereof, of which 3- and 4-nitrophenol and 1- and 2-naphthol are preferred and 2-nitrophenol is particularly preferred,<br>
The amount of organic medium used per g of crude copper phthalocyanine pigment is generally within the range from 1 to 20 g, preferably within the range from 1 to 6 g.<br>
The pigment treatment of the present invention can be carried out both in the absence and in the presence of water. That is, the crude halogenated copper phthalocyanine pigment can be used in dried form or else advantageously directly in the form of the as-halogenated, water-moist (water content customarily within the range of from 50 to 90% by weight) filter press cake.<br>
The amount of water in the	pigment treatment of the present<br>
invention is not critical,	but excessively large quantities of<br>
water should be avoided so	as not to lower the space-time yields<br>
unnecessarily.<br>
The pigment treatment of the present invention is carried out in the presence of one of the aforementioned copper phthalocyanine derivatives, including, of course, mixtures of the derivatives.<br>
The copper phthalocyanine derivatives serve both to control crystal growth during recrystallization and to modify the surface of the resulting pigment. Their choice depends on the degree of chlorination of the crude pigment, the property profile desired for the recrystallized pigment and the later application medium.<br><br><br><br><br>

The copper phthalocyanine derivative II is used in the process of the present invention in an amount which is generally within the range from 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably within the range from 1 to 10% by weight, each percentage being based on the crude copper phthalocyanine pigment.<br>
Suitable process temperatures are generally within the range from 80 to 200°C, preferably within the range from 80 to 120°C, the temperature also having to be conformed in each case to the<br><br>
melting point of the acidic aromatic organic medium.<br>
In the presence of water, the pigment treatment of the present invention is carried out preferably at &gt; lOO^C in a sealed reactor under autogenous pressure.<br>
The pigment treatment customarily takes from 2 to 10 h, especially from 2 to 5 h. The higher the selected temperature, the faster the recrystallization.<br>
The process of the present invention is advantageously carried out at follows:<br>
A mixture of crude halogenated copper phthalocyanine pigment, which is preferably present as a water-moist filter cake, copper phthalocyanine derivative and acidic aromatic organic medium is heated to the desired temperature and stirred at that temperature for from 2 to 10 h. To isolate the pigment, aqueous base (eg. from 2 to 60% strength by weight alkali metal hydr'oxide solution) is added at from 50 to 100°C in at least the amount which is stoichiometrically required to convert the organic medium into its water-soluble alkali metal salt. The pigment is subsequently filtered off, washed with water and dried.<br>
The organic medium can be reprecipitated by acidification of the alkali metal salt solution using mineral acid and cooling at room temperature and reused for a pigment treatment.<br>
The process of the present invention provides an advantageous way to obtain brilliant, transparent and strong halogenated (both incipiently halogenated and polyhalogenated) copper phthalocyanine pigments having excellent rheological properties, suitable for use in both conventional and waterborne coating systems.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for transforming crude halogenated copper phthalocyanine pigments having a chlorine of from 4 to 50.3% by weight into a brilliant, transparent pigments having better rheological properties than the starting phthalocyanine pigment comprising the steps of treating the crude pigment at 80 to 200X with an acidic aromatic organic compound of the general formula I<br><br>
where X is hydroxyl or carboxyl and the benzene ring D may additionally bear up to two identical or different substituents selected fonn the group consisting of nitro, Cj-C^-alkyl, Cj-C^-alkenyl, chlorine and bromine and may be benzofused, in the presence of a copper phthalocyanine derivative selected from the group consisting of tiie copper phthalocyanine-sulfonic and -carboxylic acids and their alkali metal, ammonium and alkylammonium salts, the amino-substituted and aminomethvlated copper phthalocyanines, and their reaction products with alkylating agents, sulfonic acids, sulfonyl chlorides and carbonyl chlorides, the imidomethylene- and amidomethylene-substituted copper phthalocyanines, the alkyl-, aryl-and cyano-substiTuted copper phthalocyanines and the hydroxyl- and alkoxy substituted copper phthalocyanines, if desired in the presence of water and isolatmg the pigment through filtering off after converting the organic medium into its water soluble alkali metal salt by adding aqueous base.<br><br>
Examples<br>
A mixture of 50 g (reckoned 100%) of a crude halogenated copper phthalocyanine pigment having a chlorine content of xi% by weight (used in the form of an aqueous press cake having a water content of X2% by weight), 2,5 g of copper phthalocyanine derivative II'<br><br>
and 100 g of organic medium ill was heated to 100°C and stirred at that temperature for 5 h.<br>
