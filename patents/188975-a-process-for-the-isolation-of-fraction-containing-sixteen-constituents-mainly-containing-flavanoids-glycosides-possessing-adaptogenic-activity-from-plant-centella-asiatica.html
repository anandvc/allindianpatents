				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the isolation of fraction containing sixteen constituents mainly containing flavanoids &amp; glycosides possessing adaptogenic activity from plant Centella Asiatica. The fraction so obtained has been designated by us as 'Centelloglycotonide.<br>
Centelloglycotonide is comprised of complex mixture of sixteen components with ten constituents comprising mainly of flavonoids and their corresponding glycosides showing presence in the range of 0.8 to 25.4% as monitored by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Centella asiatica (Linn) urban (Syn. Hydrocotyle asiatica Linn Sans. Mandukaparni; Hindi, Brahma-manduki or Brahmi; N.O. Apiaceae) is cosmopolitan in its natural distribution. It is listed drug in the Ayurvedic, [ (1992) the wealth of India-Raw Materials, vo!3 (Revised) 428; Publication and Information Directorate<br>
(CSIR), New Delhi ], Chinese, [Tang, W.; Eisenbrand, G.<br>
(1992): Chinese Drugs of plant origin, Chemistry, Pharmacology and use in Traditional and Modern.Medicine, 273]and several pharmacopoeias [ (1993) The Martindale Extra Pharmacopoeia, JUL.U Saiv-ion, 756.3] of the world. C.asiatica a prostrate, faintly aromatic, stolcnif erous, perennial herb upto 2. m long is widely distributed in India. It is commonly found as weed in crop fields and occurs wild in marshy banks of rivers, streams, ponds and other waste places throughout India<br><br>
upto an atitude of 600 m. In the traditional system of medicine the plant is given internally as digestible, laxative, cooling, tonic, alterative, antipyretic and also for improving appetite, voice, memory, anaemia, diseases of blood, bronchitis and asthma. [Kiritikar, K.R. and Basu, B.D. (1988) Indian Medicinal plants vol. II (3rd Ed.) 1194 (International book Dept; Dehradaun]. Externally cold poultice of fresh plant is applied in rheumatism, elephantiasis and hydrocele [(1992) The wealth of India-Raw materials, vo!3 (Revised) 429 (Publication and Information Directorate, CSIR, New Delhi)]<br>
Though the plant has numerous other uses mentioned in the literature but the most important of all, is that in the classical Ayurvedic system of medicine it is used as 'RASAYANA'  (Rejuvenator) to improve the texture of the human skin, for enhancing learing and memory and increasing the life span [ Singh, R.H., Shukla, S.P., and Misra, B.K.,  (1981) J. Res. Ayurv. and Sidda 2(1), 1, kakar, K.K.,  (1990) Probe 29(3), 176]. Antianxiety and antistress activities of the drug have also been reported [Upadhyay, S.C., Khosa, R.L., Sharma, N.D., Kumar, M and Chansauria, J.P.N. (1991) Ind. Drug 28 (8) 388] .<br>
Previous studies on this plant have revealed the presence of several triterpenoid saponins and sapoge-nins derived from ursanoic acid have been isolated and<br><br>
characterised [ Polonsky, J. (1953) Bull. Soc. Chem. Fr. 173; Polonsky, J. Sach, E. Laderer, E. (1959) Bull. Soc. Fr. 880 and Luo, SQ and Chin, H.F.  (1980) Chin Trad. Herb. Drugs 11 ] Brahmic acid isolated from Indian plant was found structurally indentical to madecassic acid obtained from madagascar variety [Pinhas, H (1969) Bull. Soc. Chem. Fr. 173]. In addition to triterpenoid constituents, some mono and ses-quiterpenoids [ Asakawa, Y; Matsuda, R. and Takamoto, T. (1982) Phytochemistry 21, 2590 ] and some polyacety-lenic compounds [ Bohlmann F. and Zdero, C (1975) Chem. Ber. 108(2), 511 ] were reported. Recently three flavo-noid glycosides were obtained from leaves of the plant growing in Madagascar and have been identified as 3-glucosylquercetin, 3-glucosylkaempferol and 7-glucosyl-kaempferol Prum, N. ; Illel, B. ; Raynaud, J.  (1983) Pharmazie 38, 423.<br>
Keeping in view the high reputation enjoyed by C. asiatica in traditional system of medicine in India we have carried out research work on this plant with the main objective to provide a process for the preparation of a fraction containing constituents responsible for adaptogenic activity.<br>
Aqueous alcoholic extract of C.asiatica (fresh whole plant) on submitting to preliminary pharmacological screening showed significant antistress activity. The active extract was subjected to successive partitioning between water and different organic solvents<br><br>
with   increasing  polarity   resulting   into   a   number   of fractions    on   detailed   pharmacological    evaluation, maximum  activity  was   located   in   the   polar   fraction (butanol   fraction).    The   fraction   was   subjected   to medium pressure   liquid   chromatography   (MPLC)   using silica gel   (230-400  mesh)   and  eluting  the   fraction with mixture   of   organic   solvent    in   order   of    increasing polarity to yield  a  fraction which has been  code  marked as    'F'    showing   most   potent   antistress   activity.    The bioactive  fraction   (F)   so obtained was  designated by us as    'Centelloglycotonide1.    Pharmacological    testing   of Centelloglycotonide    elicited   dose-dependant    activity against   physical   and   chemical   stress   in   experimental animals   following   standard  procedures.   The   effect   was on   swimming   performance,    anti-fatigue,    survival   time against   swimming,    hypoxia,    protection   against   dose induced  liver  damage   and  antiinflammatory  activities. Doses  from  12.5   to  100  mg/kg given orally  for  two weeks to   different   groups   of   animals   showed   increase    in survival   swimming  time  upto   51%,   hypoxia  upto   53%  with 100%   animals   showing  antifatigue   effect.   There  was   no mortality  among   the   drug   treated  animals   in   three   hour continuous  swimming.   It  also  exhibited hepatoprotective and   antiinflammatory    activities.     Its    effects    when 'tested  were   comparable   to   some   presently   available drugs  in the market  like   'Plus  30',   Dabur's   'Ashwagand-ha'    and   Doosan's    "Ginseng   tea1.    Preparative   reversed<br><br>
phase HPLC of the fraction (F) designated as centello-glycotonide was carried out on U Bonda pack C-18 column using UV (light scattering)detector. Three solvent systems (I) MeOH-H20 (15:85), (II) (52:48) and (III) pure menthanol were used in sequence. As a result sixteen peaks were observed of which ten constituents were in the range of 0.8 to 25.4%. Which comprising of carbohydrates, phenols and flavonoids. It failed to respond to Lieberman-Burchard reaction.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the isolation of fraction containing sixteen constituents mainly containing flavanoids &amp; glycosides possessing adaptogonic activity from plant centella asiatica comprises :<br>
i)    Crushing   and   homogenising   of   fresh   whole   plant   of C.asiatica.<br>
ii)    Extracting   the   said   homogenised   plant   using      an aqueous  alcohol.<br>
iii) Concentrating the said aqueous alcoholic extract to minimum volume by conventional method and partitioning with different organic solvents of increasing polarity and drying the polar fraction completely, iv) Subjecting the said poler  fraction to conventional chromatographic method employing silica gel of mesh size 230-400 and eluting the fraction with required solvent mixture to yield the said fraction having adaptogenic activity.<br><br>
In the prefered embodiment of the present invention the choice of the drug as in the step (i), the solvent used in step (ii) for preparing the alcohol extract may be methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or their mixtures. In the step (iii) polar solvents of appropriate polarity is selected. In the chromatograph-ic method in step (iv) for the separation of Centello-glycotonide solvent can be selected from chlorinated solvents, ethylacetate, acetone, methanol and their mixtures in order of increasing polarity.<br>
The invention is described in detailed by .the set of examples given below which should not however be construed to limit the scope of present invention. Homogenity and reproducibility of the activity fraction is monitored by reversed phase HPLC. Example I<br>
The homogenised fresh whole plant (2 kg) was well stirred for 10-15 minutes in a percolator with 6 litres of methanol and allowed to stand the contents for 18 hours and extract was drawn. Two more extractions were taken by adding each time 5 litres of methanol for a period of twenty four hours. The combined 3 extracts were concentrated. The resultant concentrate (300-350 ml) was partitioned with hexane, chloroform, ethylac-tate &amp; butanol in order of increasing polarity. All these fractions were tested for their antistress activity. The polar fraction (butanol extract) yielded 12g<br><br>
dry mass which showed dose dependant antistress activity. The part of the active fraction (10 g) was subjected to medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) over silica gel 250 g (230-400 -mesh) and each fraction collected was of 250 ml.<br>
The column was eluted successively with (a) Chloroform 750 ml (b) Chloroform-methanol 2 litres (9:1) (c) Chloroform-methanol 2 li tres to (8:2) (d) Chloroform-methanol 2.25 litres (7:3) (e) Chloroform-methanol 500 ml (6:4) (f) Chloroform-methanol 2.5 litres (4:6) and Chloroform-methanol 500 ml (2:8) (g) pure MeOH 500 ml and (h) finally with methanol-water 250 ml (85:15). The eluants of fraction (f) were pooled and concentrated to yield centelloglycotonide (0.95) Preparative HPLC of fraction (f) revealed it to be a complex mixture of unidentified sixteen constituents with ten showing presence in range of 0.8 to 25.4%. The detailed HPLC (waters-991) data given as cloumn used U Bonda pack C-18 column'; solvent systems-(1) MeOH-H2O (15:85)  (2) (52:48) and (3) pure methanol with UV light scattering detector concentration 4 mg/ml injection; total peaks 16 numbers with ten coded peaks percentage given in the parenthesis. YgS,[3.75], Vgl2,  [11.45]; Vg 6 and I"?, [8.30]; Vgl3,  [5.50]; Vgl4,  [4.35], Vg 15,  [3.95]; Vg 8,  [25.40]; Vg 16, [3.95], Vg 10,  [0.8] &amp; Vg 9,  [6.80]. Cenlloglycotonide showed qualitatively the presence of carbohydrates, phenols and flavonoids. pH of its aqueous solution was recorded as 4.5. It failed to respond<br><br>
to   Lieberaman-Burchard   reaction   showing.absence   of   a steroid  or  a  triterpenoid. Example  2<br>
The   homogenised   fresh   whole   plant    (2   kg)    was charged   into   percolator   provided   with   stirrer   and extracted  with menthanol    (3x5   litres)    for  a  period  of 18-42   hours.   The   combined percolates  was   concentrated and  the   resultant   dark  green  Viscous   concentrate    (350-370   ml)   was  partitioned  with  hexane,    chloroform,    ethy-lacetate  and butanol   in  that  order.     A maximum activity was   located   in  the  polar  butanol   fraction   (12   g)   when tested biologically.   A portion  of  polar  fraction   (10  g) was  subjected  to  column  chromatography using  silica  gel (100-200   mesh)    and   eluting,    the   column   successively with   (a)    Chloroform  750   ml    (b)    Chloroform-methanol      2 litres    (9:1)     (c)    Chloroform-methanol   2    litres    (8:2) (d)   Chloroform-methanol   2.5   litres    (6; 4)       (e)    Chloro-form.-MeOH   1    litre    (4:6)     (f)    Chlorof orm-methanol    3 litres    (2:8)    (g)   pure   methanol   1   litre   and   finally   (h) methanol-water   1   litre    (85:15)    in   that   order.    Each eluate  of   250  ml   was   collected.   The   eluant   from  fraction   (f)   was  poled  and  concentrated   to  yield  brownish yellow  material    (0.89   g)    is   designated  as   Centellogly-cotonide  possessing  antistress   activity  and   identical chemical  behaviour as  cited in example  I. Example 3<br>
Fresh drug   (2   kg)   was  extracted with methanol    (3x5<br><br>
litres)    in   a   homogeniser   as   in   examples   1   and   2   and<br>
combined  percolate   was   concentrated  and   the   resultant<br>
dark  brown   concentrate    (400   ml)    was   extracted   with<br>
(4x320   ml)    a   mixture   of   ethylacetate   and   methanol<br>
(85:15).   The   combined   extract   distilled   and   dried   to<br>
yield  centelloglycotonide    (0.81   g)   with   similar   antis-<br>
tress   activity   and   chemical   behaviour   as   observed   in<br>
the  compound  isolated  in examples   1   &amp;  2   as  monitored by<br>
HPLC.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
