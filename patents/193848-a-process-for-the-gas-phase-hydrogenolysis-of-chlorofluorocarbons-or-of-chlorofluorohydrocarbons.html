The present invention relates to a process for the gas-phase hydrogenolysis chlorofluorocarbons or of chlorofluorohydrocarbons.<br>
It  appears  to  be  clearly  established  that  one factor  responsible  for  the  decrease  of   the  ozone  layer in  the  stratosphere  is  chlorofluorocarbons   The  reason for  this   is   that  liberated  CFCs   tend  to  percolate slowly  up  to   the  stratosphere,   where  they  decompose  by photodissociation  releasing  monoatomic  chlorine.   The chlorine  atom  destroys  O3   (ozone)   molecules  in  the course  of  catalytic  cycles  during  which  it  is regenerated,   thereby  being  able  to  affect  several molecules.   The  international  commxmity  has   thus  decided to  abandon  the  production  of  CFC  and  it  has consequently  become  necessary  to  find  and  produce acceptable  substitutes.<br>
CFCs  are  composed,   as   their  cone  suggests,   of chlorine,   fluorine  and  carbon  atoms,   but  lack  hydrogen. One  strategy  envisaged  by  producers   is   to  replace  them by  molecules  containing  the  same  elements  plus hydrogen,   which  are  thus  less  stable  and  are  capable  of degrading  rapidly  in  the  lower  atmosphere.   The  ultimate aim  is   to  use  compoxinds  lacking  chlorine, fluorohydrocarbons   (FHCs),   which  should  have  no  impact on  ozone.<br><br>
Hydrogenolysis  which  comprises  replacing  a chlorine  atom  by  a  hydrogen  atom  in  a  molecule  is  a reaction  which  is  particularly  well   suited  to  solving the  problem  posed.<br>
The  importance  of  this  reaction  is  shown  by the  nimbler  of  patents  which  relate  to  it.     Thus,   the hydrogenolysis  of  chlorodifluoromethane  to difluoromethane  is  described  in  EP-A-0,508,660,   and those  of  chlorotetrafluoroethane  and dichlorotetrafluoroethane  to  tetrafluoroethane  are mentioned  in  GB-A-1,578,933,   EP-A-0,349,115  and  US-A-4,873,3 81.   This   type  of  reaction  also  constitutes  a good  means  of  purifying  the  FHCs  of   the  CFCs  which  may be  present,   as  described  in  WO  94/02439  in  the  case  of pentafluoroethane.<br>
However,   the  main  drawback  of  hydrogenolysis processes  lies  in  the  stability  of  the  catalytic activity  over  time.   Indeed,   cinder  the  often  severe reaction  conditions  necessary  for  the  complete conversion  of  the  reactants,   the  catalyst  becomes deactivated  over  time.   It  is  thus  necessary  to  replace it  periodically  or  to  find  an  effective  means  of regenerating  the  spent  catalyst.<br>
In  this  respect,   several  techniques   for regenerating  hydrogenolysis  catalysts  are  described  in the  literature.     WO  93/24224  proposes  oxidation  of   the spent  catalyst  with  oxygen  or  an  oxidizing  agent. Treatments  with  chlorine   (US-A-5,057,470)   or  with  the<br><br>
CPC  which  may  be  the  reactant  to  convert (US-A-4,980,324)   also  proved  to  be  effective.   However, these  processes  only  reactivate  the  catalysts,   which still  have  the  same  drawbacks  after  the  treatment.<br>
It  has  now  been  fo\and  that  the  incorporation of  sulphur  into  a  palladium-based  catalyst  deposited  on a  support  imparts  to  this  catalyst  the  property  of being  much  more  stable  in  gas-phase  hydrogenolysis reactions,   both  in  reactions  for  the  synthesis  of  FHC from  CFC  or  from  CFHC,   and  in  processes  for  the purifying  of  CFC  impurities  contained  in  the  FHCs.<br>
The  sulphur  treatment  of  a hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis  catalyst  is  known  from FR-A-2,645,531,   which  describes  the  treatment  of  a  Pd/C catalyst  with  sulphur-containing  compounds  in  order  to increase  the  selectivity  for  the  liquid-phase hydrogenolysis  of  dichloroacetic  acid   (Click-COOH)   to monochloroacetic  acid   (HjClC-COOH) .  However,   it  was totally  tm expected  that  treatment  of  the  catalyst  with a  sulphur  compound  would  allow  its  activity  to  be stabilized  in  the  gas-phase  hydrogenolysis  of  CFC  or  of CFHC,   all  the  more  so  since  the  final  research  report from  J.D.   Park  and  J.R.   Lacier  published  in  1959,  which research  was  financed  by  the  Air  Force  Office  of Scientific  Research   (No.   TR5899)   and  the  Armed  Services Technical  In formations  Agency   (No.  AD  162198), describes  a  treatment  of  the  support  in  order  to  remove the  sulphur  before  impregnation  with  palladium.<br><br>
According  to  the  invention  there  is  provided a  process  for  the  gas-phase  hydrogenolysis  of chlorofluorocarbons  or  of  chlorofluorohydrocarbons  in the  presence  of  a  palladium-based  catalyst   on  a  support,  wherein sulphur  is  incorporated  into  the  catalyst.<br>
In  the  catalyst  used  in  the  invention,   the support  may  be  charcoal,   a  fluoroalumina  or  aluminixan fluoride,   and  the  palladium  is  advantageously  deposited onto  this  support  at  a  proportion  of  from  0.1  to  10%  by weight  relative  to  the  total  weight  of  the  catalyst   (Pd +  support).<br>
The  anoint  of  sulphur  to  be  incorporated  into the  catalyst  may  range  from  0.75   to  750  mg  of  sulphur per  gram  of  palladium.   It  is  preferably  between  2  and 100  mg  of  sulphur  per  gram  of     and  more particularly  between  7.5  and  75  mg  of  sulphur  per  gram of   <br>
The  sulphur  may  be  incorporated  into  the catalyst  before  and/or  during  its  use.   The incorporation  may  be  performed  in  various  ways depending  on  whether  the  sulphur-containing  precursor compound  is  normally  liquid   (for  example  SClj,   SjClj, CSj,   thiophene,   dimethyl  sulphide,   etc.)   or  gaseous   (for example  HjS,   methyl  mercaptan,   etc.).<br>
When  the  sulphur-containing  precursor compound  is  a  liquid,   the  process  may  be  performed  by impregnation  in  the  presence  of  a  solvent  whose  choice<br><br>
depends  on  the  nature  of  the  sulphur-containing precursor.   In  the  case  of  CS^,   ethanol   is  particularly suitable;   however,   any  solvent  for  CSj  may  be  used.  . After  the  impregnation,   the  catalyst  is  heat-treated under  an  atmosphere  of  a  gas  which  may  be  inert, although  hydrogen  is  preferably  used,   at  a  temperature of  between  150  and  400"C  to  decompose  the  sulphur-containing  composing.<br>
When  the  sulphur-containing  precursor  is normally  gaseous   (H2S,   H3C-SH)   or  is  a  liquid  which  has a  high  vapour  pressure   (for  example  CSj) ,   it  may  be introduced  onto  the  catalyst  via  the  gaseous  phase before  or  during  admission  of  the  hydrogen  and  the reactant  to  be  hydrogenolysed.   In  this  particularly advantageous  technique  for  the  "in  situ"   treatment  of the  catalyst  in  the  reactor,   the  cutout  of  sulphur introduced  onto  the  catalyst  may  be  adjusted  to  the levels  mentioned  previously  by  varying  the concentration  of  the  sulphur-containing  commoved  in  the gas,   the  flow  rate  of  the  gas  and  the  duration  of  the treatment.<br>
Irrespective  of  the  sulphur-containing compound  and  its  mode  of  incorporation,   the introduction  of  sulphur  followed  by  a  heat  treatment leads  to  the  formation  of  a  solid  phase  of  sulphur  and palliatives  of   formula  Pd4S.   However,   total  conversion  of the  available  palladium  is  not  necessary  to  obtain  a stable  catalyst.<br><br>
The  operating  conditions   for  the hydrogenolysis  reaction  may  vary  within  a  wide  range depending  on  the  nature  of  the  reactant  to  be hydrogenolysed   (CFC  or  CFHC):<br>
•	The  reaction  temperature  is  generally between  100  and  450°C,  but  it  is  preferred to  work  between  150  and  350°C.<br>
•	The  pressure  may  range  from  1  to  50  bar;   an increase  in  pressure  has  the  effect  of increasing  the  contact  time  and  thus  of making  it  possible  to  achieve  high conversions  for  a  given  temperature.<br>
•	The  hourly  flow  rate  of  reactant  fed continuously  into  the  reactor  may  range from  0.01  to  12  mol  per  litre  of  catalyst.<br>
•	The Hj/reactant molar ratio is generally between 0.5 and 10, preferably between 1 and  6.<br>
Examples  of  reactants  to  which  the  process according  to  the  invention  applies,   include chloropentafluoroethane   (F115),   1,1-dichloro-l,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane   {F114a),   chlorodifluoromethane   (F22), l-chloro-l,l-difluoroethane   (F142b)   and  1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane   (F124),   the  hydrogenolysis  of which  leads  respectively  to  pentafluoroethane   (F125), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane   (F134a),   difluoromethane (F32),   1,1-difluoroethane   (F152a)   and  1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane   {F134a).   Mention  may  also  be  made  of<br><br>
   chlorofluoro(hydro)carbons  such  as  1,2,2-trichloro-l, 1, 3, 3, 3-pentaf luoropropane   (F215aa)   or  1,2-dichloro-1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropane   (F225da)   the hydrogenolysis  of  which  leads  to  1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane   (F245fa).<br>

The solid  is  maintained  in  contact  with  the  solution  at 20°C  for  20  hours.   The  catalyst  is  then  recovered  by filtration,   followed  by  reduction  at  300°C  under  an atmospheric  pressure  of  hydrogen  for  4  hours.   The amount  of  sulphur  bound  is  0.2%  by  weight  and  X-ray diffraction  demonstrates  the  fozmation  of  a  Pd4S  phase.<br>

EXAMPLE   6<br>
a)   Treatment  of   the  catalyst<br>
75  ml  of  the  same  commercial  2%  Pd/C  catalyst as  in  Example  4  are  loaded  into  a  rotary  evaporator, followed  by  introduction  of  100  ml  of  an  ethanol solution  containing  0.007  mol/litre  of  CSj.   The  solid  is maintained  in  contact  with  the  solution  at  20°C  for 2 0  hours.   The  catalyst  is   then  recovered  by  filtration, followed  by  reduction  at  300**C  under  an  atmospheric<br><br>
pressure  of  hydrogen  for  4  hours.   The  amount  of   sulphur<br>
bound  is   0.15%  by  weight  and  X-ray  diffraction<br>
demonstrates   the  formation  of  a  Pd4S  phase.<br>
b)   Synthesis  of  the  F125<br>
75  ml  of  the  catalyst  prepared  above  are<br>
introduced  into  the  same  tubular  reactor  as  in<br>
Example  4,   followed  by  passage  of  a  mixture  of  hydrogen<br>
and  chloropentafluoroethane   (F115)   into  the  reactor<br>
iinder  the  following  operating  conditions:<br>
Temperature	:     250°C<br>
