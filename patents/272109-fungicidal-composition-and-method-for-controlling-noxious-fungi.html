				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
FUNGICIDAL COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING NOXIOUS FUNGI TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a fungicidal composition having effects for controlling various noxious fungi remarkably improved, and a method for controlling noxious fungi. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Patent Documents 1, 2 and 3 disclose that compounds included in the formula (I) given hereinafter are useful as fungicides, and it is disclosed that they may be used in combination or as mixed with other fungicides, as the case requires.  However, it is not known that the compound of the formula (I) presents a distinctly superior fungicidal effect when it is used in combination with another specific fungicide in a synergistically effective amount.  Further, Patent Documents 4 and 5 disclose that compounds included in the formula (I) given hereinafter are useful as pesticides such as nematicidal agents.<br>
Patent Document 1:  WO06/016708<br>
Patent Document 2:  WO07/069777<br>
Patent Document 3:  JP-A-2007-210924<br>
Patent Document 4:  EP1256569A<br>
Patent Document 5:  EP1428817A DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The carboxylic acid amide derivatives of the formula (I) given hereinafter sometimes show practically no adequate controlling effects against certain diseases, such that their controlling effects are not adequate against certain noxious fungi depending upon the concentration range or the application site, the residual effects are relatively short, or the resistance against rain is weak.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
The present inventors have conducted a research to solve the above problem and as a result, have found that particularly when a carboxylic acid amide derivative of the formula (I) given hereinafter and a certain specific fungicidally effective compound are used as mixed, it is possible to obtain unexpectedly excellent fungicidal activities as compared with a case where the respective compounds are used independently.  Thus, the present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this discovery. Namely, the present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising synergistically effective amounts of (a) a carboxylic acid amide derivative of the formula (I) or its salt:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein B is a heterocyclic group which may be substituted by Y; each of R1 and R2 which are independent of each other, is C1-12 alkyl; X is halogen, C1-12 alkyl or C1-12  alkoxy; Y is halogen, C1-12   alkyl or C1-12   haloalkyl; and n is an integer of from 0 to 5; and (b) at least one fungicidal compound selected from the group consisting of an azole compound, an anilinopyrimidine compound, a triazolopyrimidine compound, a strobilurin compound, an N-halogenothioalkyl compound, a pyridinamine compound, a bicarbonate, an inorganic sulfur compound, a dithiocarbamate compound, an organic chlorine compound, a dicarboxyimide compound, an amine compound, a phenylpyrrole compound, a benzophenone compound, a piperidine compound, a dinitrobenzene compound, a morpholine compound, a cyanoacetamide compound, a phosphorous acid compound, an organophosphorus compound, a carboxamide compound, a quinoline compound, a copper compound, a carbamate compound, an antibiotic, a guanidine compound, an oxime ether compound, a 4-quinolinol derivative compound, a cyanomethylene compound, a quinazolinone<br>
compound and a benzoylpyridine compound.  Further, the present invention<br>
provides a method for controlling noxious fungi, which comprises applying a fungicidally effective amount of such a fungicidal composition to noxious fungi or to a site where they grow.  Further, the present invention provides a method for controlling noxious fungi, which comprises applying a fungicidally effective amount of (a) the carboxylic acid amide derivative of the formula (I) or its salt, and a fungicidally effective amount of (b) the fungicidal compound, to noxious fungi or to a site where they grow. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The fungicidal composition comprising synergistically effective amounts of (a) the carboxylic acid amide derivative of the formula (I) or its salt, and (b) the fungicidal compound (hereinafter referred to simply as the composition of the present invention) is capable of controlling, particularly at low dose, various fungi such as Oomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes or Deuteromycetes, and capable of effectively controlling various plant diseases thereby caused.  Unexpectedly, their fungicidal activities exhibit an effect more than a mere additive effect of their respective individual fungicidal activities, i.e. a synergistic fungicidal activity.  Thus, the composition of the present invention containing synergistically effective amounts of (a) the carboxylic acid amide derivative of the formula (I) or its salt, and (b) the fungicidal compound, can be applied in a low dose as compared with a case where the respective agents are used independently, and accordingly, it is effective also to reduce the environmental load at the application site or its surroundings. Further, the fungicidal spectrum can be enlarged, and further, the fungicidal activities will last over a long period of time. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>

TEST EXAMPLE 7:  Test on Antifungal Activity Against Gray Mold Pathogen<br>
On a potato sucrose agar medium in a Petri dish, a suspension of spores of Botrytis cinerea (spore concentration: 2xl06 spores/ml) was spread in an amount of 300 µl per Petri dish and dried.  Thereon, filter paper immersed in a chemical solution (30 ppm) of Compound No. 2 and a filter paper immersed in a chemical solution (30 ppm) of fluazinam were placed to intersect each other (the respective filter papers were air-dried ones of 0.7 cm x 8 cm) .  The system was left to stand at 20°C for 4 days, and then, mycelial growth of Botrytis cinerea was observed (photograph in Fig. 1).  In Fig. 1, the transversely-placed filter paper is one immersed in Compound No. 2, and the longitudinally-placed filter paper is one immersed in fluazinam.  The white turbid portion is a portion where Botrytis cinerea proliferated.<br>
Both end portions of the transversely-placed filter paper are in contact with mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea, thus indicating that by the single use of Compound No. 2 (30 ppm), no adequate controlling effect can be obtained.  Whereas, both end portions of the longitudinally-placed filter paper, are not in contact with mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea, thus indicating that by the single use of fluazinam (30 ppm), a certain controlling effect is obtained.  Whereas, in the vicinity of the intersection of filter papers, the filter papers are not in contact with mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea over a wide range, thus indicating that when Compound No. 2 and fluazinam are used in combination, an excellent controlling effect can be obtained.<br>
This controlling effect was numerically represented.  Namely, the<br>
distance from both ends of the longitudinally-placed filter paper<br>
corresponding to a single use section of fluazinam to the mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea was measured at four portions (arrow portions in Fig. 2), and averaged to obtain 5 mm.  On the other hand, the distance from the portion where the filter papers intersect each other, corresponding to a mixed use section of Compound No. 2 and fluazinam to mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea was measured at four portions (arrow portions in Fig. 3) and averaged to obtain 17 mm. TEST EXAMPLE 8:  Test on Antifungal Activity Against Gray Mold Pathogen<br>
The test was carried out in the same manner as in Test Example 7 except that 30 ppm of fluazinam was changed to 30 ppm of oxpoconazole fumarate.  As a result, the distance (average value) from both ends of the longitudinally-placed filter paper corresponding to the single use section of oxpoconazole fumarate to mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea, was 7.5 mm.  Whereas, the distance (average value) from the portion where the filter papers intersect each other corresponding to a mixed use section of Compound No. 2 and oxpoconazole fumarate to mycelial growth area of Botrytis cinerea was 13.3 mm.<br>
