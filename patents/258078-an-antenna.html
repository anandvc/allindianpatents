This invention relates in general to antennas, and<br>
in particular to the antenna structure and the<br>
architecture of the processing of data from sensors of<br>
such antennas when they are used for reception.<br>
It is known in the field of radar to use surface<br>
antennas with beam-forming by calculation, intended to<br>
detect, locate and classify targets or sources. Such an<br>
antenna generally consists of an array including up to<br>
several thousand sensors arranged so as to form a<br>
rectangular planar surface. These sensors generally<br>
have an identical directivity pattern. This basic<br>
directivity pattern does not have a sufficient<br>
resolution for the performance required from the<br>
antenna in location. A beam-forming device produces a<br>
combination (for example, a linear combination) of<br>
signals generated by the sensors so as to form the<br>
required elevation angle and bearing directivities.<br>
Such an antenna has disadvantages. For a given<br>
precision of the location in terms of elevation angle<br>
and bearing, this antenna is very expensive and<br>
difficult to integrate on a stationary or mobile<br>
platform, such as a naval platform, an aircraft, a land<br>
vehicle or a spacecraft.<br>
Therefore, an antenna solving one or more of these<br>
disadvantages is needed. The invention therefore<br>
relates to an antenna including:<br>
- a first and a second linear sub-antenna:<br><br>
-	each having a plurality of sensors arranged<br>
so as to form first and second line portions,<br>
respectively, with each sensor generating a<br>
basic signal;<br>
-	wherein the angle between the respective<br>
directional vectors of the first and second<br>
tangents to the midpoint respectively of the<br>
first and second line portions is between 3 0°<br>
and 15 0°;<br>
-	an antenna processing device forming a plurality<br>
of combined signals for each line portion, which signal<br>
is a combination of basic signals of the sensors of<br>
this line portion;<br>
-	a signal processing device generating combined<br>
signals useful for filtering the noise of the combined<br>
signals coming from each line portion;<br>
a device for calculating the correlation<br>
coefficients between the useful combined signals of the<br>
first line portion and the useful combined signals of<br>
the second line portion;<br>
-	a device generating a detection signal when a<br>
correlation coefficient exceeds a predetermined<br>
threshold.<br>
According to an alternative, the antenna also<br>
includes a target detection device, comparing each<br>
calculated correlation coefficient with a predefined<br>
associated threshold, detecting and locating a target<br>
when a correlation coefficient exceeds the associated<br>
threshold.<br>
According to another alternative, the antenna<br>
includes a device for processing the detection signal<br><br>
and the correlation coefficients generating information<br>
concerning the target detected. According to another<br>
alternative, the information generated includes the<br>
distance, the elevation, the bearing and the speed of<br>
the target. The antenna can also include a device<br>
displaying the information generated.<br>
According to another alternative, each sensor<br>
includes a plurality of elementary sensors selected<br>
from the group consisting of radar, radioelectric and<br>
electromagnetic sensors, hydrophones, transducers,<br>
microphones, ultrasound sensors, accelerometers, and<br>
optical and infrared sensors.<br>
It is possible for the elementary sensors to be<br>
transmissive and for the data processing device to<br>
process the combined signals according to the signal<br>
transmitted by each sensor, which processing includes,<br>
for example, a pulse compression.<br>
According to an alternative, the antenna also<br>
includes a transmitter, and the data processing device<br>
processes the combined signals according to the signal<br>
transmitted by the transmitter, which processing<br>
includes, for example a pulse compression.<br>
According to yet another alternative, the first<br>
and second line portions are curves without an<br>
inflection point. It is possible for the first and<br>
second line portions to be straight and oriented<br>
respectively in elevation angle and in bearing. These<br>
straight line portions are preferably not parallel.<br>
Other special features and advantages of the<br>
invention will become clearer from the following<br><br>
description given by way of a non-limiting example,<br>
with regard to the figures. These figures show:<br>
-	figure 1, a diagrammatic representation of an<br>
example of antenna structure and architecture for<br>
processing data from sensors of such antennas according<br>
to the invention;<br>
-	figures 2 to 4, diagrams comparing the source<br>
location for different cases;<br>
figures 5 to 14, several diagrams showing<br>
examples of linear sub-antenna structures.<br>
The term sensor hereinafter refers to a device<br>
including one or more elementary sensors. A sensor<br>
having a plurality of elementary sensors generates a<br>
basic signal based on the elementary sensor signals in<br>
a manner known per se.<br>
To improve the performance of a sensor, it is<br>
commonplace to use a module combining a plurality of<br>
sensors. The term sensor used in this document also<br>
covers a module of sensors, because a sensor and a<br>
module of sensors are functionally identical for the<br>
antenna processing.<br>
The term antenna processing hereinafter refers to<br>
the processing of signal of sensors, which forms, by<br>
combining the sensor signals, signals called channels<br>
or beams, which favour a direction of travel in the<br>
space of the physical quantity. The signal combinations<br>
mentioned below will be, for example, linear<br>
combinations of these signals.<br>
The invention proposes an antenna including at<br>
least two linear sub-antennas, each equipped with<br>
sensors - forming a line portion. The two line portions<br><br>
are defined as follows: tangents to the midpoint of<br>
each line portion are formed. The angle between<br>
directional vectors of these tangents must then be<br>
between 30° and 150°. The orientations of the line<br>
portions are thus distinct enough for the antenna to<br>
recover sufficient information along two distinct axes<br>
considered to be orthogonal. Each of the linear sub-<br>
antennas has an antenna processing device that<br>
generates one or more combined signals. Each of the<br>
linear sub-antennas has a signal processing device<br>
applied to the combined signals, which provides one or<br>
more useful combined signals. These useful combined<br>
signals are the results of the processing of the<br>
combined signals, intended to extract the noise<br>
therefrom, and are generated before the correlation<br>
processing. The antenna also has a device for<br>
calculating the correlation coefficients between the<br>
useful combined signals of one linear sub-antenna with<br>
the useful combined signals of the other linear sub-<br>
antenna. The resolution information is obtained by-<br>
calculation rather than by increasing the number of<br>
sensors.<br>
A simplified example of an antenna will be<br>
described in reference to figure 1. The antenna of<br>
figure 1 includes two linear sub-antennas 2 and 3. The<br>
linear sub-antennas 2 and 3 each include a plurality of<br>
sensors, respectively 21 to 2M and 31 to 3N. Sensors 21<br>
to 2M are arranged so as to substantially form a first<br>
line portion. Sensors 31 to 3N are arranged so as to<br>
substantially form a second line portion.<br><br>
The first and second line portions of figure 1<br>
verify the orientation condition defined previously :<br>
these line portions are in this case straight segments<br>
placed in the same plane and are orthogonal. The angle<br>
between the directional vectors can be in an<br>
appropriate range selected by a person skilled in the<br>
art. It is also possible for this angle to be in the<br>
following ranges: [40°; 140°], [50°; 130°], [60°;<br>
120°] , [70°; 110°] , [80°; 100°] , [85°; 95°] , or [89°; 91°] .<br>
Sensors 21 to 2M are in this case used to determine the<br>
elevation angle of a source or a target, while sensors<br>
31 to 3N are used to determine the bearing thereof.<br>
These sensors include one or more elementary<br>
sensors not shown, of the appropriate type. A sensor<br>
having one or more elementary sensors generates a basic<br>
signal based on elementary sensor signals in a manner<br>
that is known per se. Each sensor therefore generates a<br>
basic signal that can undergo a particular signal<br>
processing operation before the antenna processing. The<br>
sensors of a line portion can have an identical<br>
directivity and be equally distributed on this line<br>
portion. Sensors 21 to 2M respectively generate basic<br>
signals SI to SM illustrated by Si' . Sensors 31 to 3N<br>
respectively generate basic signals Gl to GN<br>
illustrated by Gj' . The symbol i' will hereinafter be<br>
used to designate all of the signals or numbers<br>
associated with a sensor 2i' . Thus, signal S4 is<br>
associated with sensor 24. Similarly, the symbol j'<br>
will be used to designate all of the signals or numbers<br>
associated with a sensor 3j'. Thus, signal G2 is<br>
associated with sensor 32.<br><br>
An antenna processing device 4 forms a combined<br>
signal of the sensors of a line portion, in a manner<br>
that is known per se. The antenna processing device 4<br>
thus generates the combined signals VSi associated with<br>
the signals Si'. An antenna processing device 5 forms a<br>
combined signal of the sensors of the other line<br>
portion, in a manner that is known per se. The antenna<br>
processing device 5 thus generates the combined signals<br>
VGj associated with the signals Gj'. The combined<br>
signals are intended, inter alia, to form directivity<br>
lobes of the antenna used for reception.<br>
Each of the linear sub-antennas has a signal<br>
processing device processing signals coming from the<br>
antenna processing. This signal processing device<br>
provides one or more useful combined signals at the<br>
output of each linear sub-antenna.<br>
The signal processing devices 6 and 7 extract the<br>
useful signal from the noise, in a manner that is known<br>
per se. Devices 6 and 7 thus respectively process the<br>
combined signals VSi and VGj in order to generate<br>
useful combined signals TSi and TGj . Signal processing<br>
devices 6 and 7 can also be coupled to the transmission<br>
device of the antenna if it is of the<br>
transmitting/receiving type or of another antenna if<br>
the antenna is only of the receiving type, so as to<br>
perform a processing operation taking into account the<br>
signals transmitted in a manner that is known per se,<br>
such as pulse compression.<br>
The calculation device 8 calculates the time or<br>
frequency correlation coefficients (depending on<br>
whether the processing was performed in the time or the<br><br>
frequency domain) between the useful combined signals<br>
TSi of the first line portion and the useful combined<br>
signals TGj of the second line portion. Thus, the<br>
matrix [Cij] of correlation coefficients is thus formed.<br>
Details regarding the calculation of these coefficients<br>
will be provided below. The calculation device 8 also<br>
uses correlation coefficients [Cij] to detect a target<br>
and generate a detection signal. A possible operation<br>
is as follows: a detection device (included in the<br>
calculation device 8 in the example) compares each<br>
correlation coefficient with a respective predefined<br>
threshold. When a given correlation coefficient is<br>
below its predefined threshold, it is considered that<br>
there is no source or target located at the<br>
intersection of the two directivity lobes VSi and VGj,<br>
in the elevation angle i and the bearing j . When a<br>
correlation coefficient exceeds its predefined<br>
threshold, however, it is considered that a source or<br>
target is located at the intersection of the two<br>
directivity lobes VSi and VGj, in the elevation angle i<br>
and the bearing j . A detection signal associated with<br>
the result of the comparison can thus be generated in<br>
the form of a binary value. All of the signals can then<br>
be arranged in a matrix [Rij]. The threshold is defined<br>
according to the desired performance of the antenna and<br>
the associated data processing device (including the<br>
antenna processing, the signal processing and the<br>
information processing), in terms of probability of<br>
detection and false alarms.<br>
In the case of antenna processing operations known<br>
to a person skilled in the art, if the antenna of<br><br>
figure 1 is of the transmission/reception type, the<br>
directivity diagram at the transmission of the antenna<br>
is that of a lobe in the form of a cross, and, by<br>
reciprocity, the directivity diagram at the reception<br>
is the same as at the transmission. With the antenna<br>
structure presented, the association of the antenna and<br>
signal processing operations makes it possible to<br>
obtain the same information as that obtained by a<br>
surface antenna, for example, a planar antenna, of<br>
which the directivity lobe at the reception would be as<br>
thin as the centre of the cross formed by the<br>
directivity lobe. In addition, also in the case of<br>
antenna processing operations known to a person skilled<br>
in the art, if the antenna of figure 1 does not perform<br>
the correlation processing between the signals coming<br>
from the linear sub-antennas, the detection performance<br>
is equivalent to that of sub-antennas alone. This<br>
performance is clearly inferior to that obtained by the<br>
antenna of the invention.<br>
The processing device 9 can perform additional<br>
information processing steps, in order to improve, for<br>
example, the performance with regard to the probability<br>
of false alarms or in order to determine the speed, the<br>
distance of a target or any other useful information.<br>
The processing device 9 is thus intended to enable the<br>
information to be processed by an operator or a<br>
processing device. This device 9 receives, at the input,<br>
data such as the matrix [Cij], the matrix [Rij] or any<br>
similar data. All of the information determined can be<br>
provided to the users by an appropriate display device<br>
10, which is known per se.<br><br>
Figures 5 to 14 show various shapes of line<br>
portions of linear sub-antennas that can be used in the<br>
context of the invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sphere with sensors arranged on<br>
its surface. The line portions of the sensors of a<br>
linear sub-antenna are selectively formed by the arcs<br>
of these circles of sensors. The circles and circle<br>
arcs will be designated by points belonging to them.<br>
The sphere of figure 5 thus has the circles of sensors<br>
EAOB, ASBN and ESON. The processing operations detailed<br>
above can be performed on different pairs of line<br>
portions. The pairs of line portions of the cross<br>
antenna can be: EAO with NAS; OBE with SBN; SON with<br>
AOB; NES with BEA; ONE with BNA; ESO with ASB; or the<br>
same pairs with sub-portions of these line portions,<br>
such as, for example, EAO with NA, or a line portion<br>
formed by a point of the EA segment and a point of the<br>
AO segment with a line portion formed by a point of the<br>
NA segment and a point of the AS segment, and so on.<br>
The line portions formed by the sensors of the<br>
linear sub-antennas can thus be oriented along<br>
orthogonal geodesic lines of the surface. When a line<br>
portion has a closed curve form, it will be divided<br>
into sub-portions so as to define line portions having<br>
a directivity equivalent to that of a rectilinear line<br>
portion; the midpoint of the line portion will be<br>
determined as a point at the level of which the<br>
distance with respect to the line portion of the other<br>
linear sub-antenna is the shortest.<br><br>
Figure 6 shows a satellite having linear sub-<br>
antennas 62 and 63 arranged on solar panels oriented in<br>
two orthogonal directions.<br>
Figure 7 shows an airplane having line portions 7 3<br>
formed by the sensors of linear sub-antennas, arranged<br>
respectively transversely on or under the wings, and a<br>
line portion 72 formed by sensors arranged respectively<br>
axially on or under the body.<br>
Figure 8 shows a missile having line portions 8 2<br>
arranged axially on the body, and a circular line<br>
portion 83 surrounding a cross-section of the body.<br>
Figure 9 shows another missile in which multiple<br>
line portions are arranged in a cross-section of the<br>
missile.<br>
Figure 10 shows line portions of linear sub-<br>
antennas suitable for a submarine. Line portion 102<br>
extends axially at the surface of the shell. Line<br>
portion 103 extends transversely between the sail and<br>
the shell.<br>
Figure 11 shows a vehicle having a platform<br>
supporting two orthogonal line portions 112 and 113.<br>
Figure 12 shows an antenna rotating about its<br>
vertical axis. A rectilinear line portion 123 extends<br>
over the axis of the antenna mount. A rectilinear line<br>
portion 122 extends over the upper portion of the<br>
antenna.<br>
Figure 13 shows a stationary antenna. Rectilinear<br>
line portions 133 extend respectively over a plurality<br>
of surfaces of the mount. A circular line portion 13 2<br>
extends over the upper portion of the antenna.<br><br>
Figure 14 also shows a stationary antenna. The<br>
upper portion has a rectangular parallelepiped shape.<br>
Each side surface has a vertical rectilinear line<br>
portion 143 and a horizontal rectilinear line portion<br>
142.<br>
It is possible to use various limitations<br>
regarding the form of the line portions. In particular,<br>
it is possible for at least one line portion to have a<br>
curved form. It is possible for such a curve not to<br>
have an inflection point. It is also possible for the<br>
variation in curvature to be limited.<br>
It is thus possible to limit the curvature near<br>
the midpoint of the line portion. The length of the<br>
line portion L and the curvilinear distance d between a<br>
point and the midpoint of the line portion are defined.<br>
For any point such as d/L
angle between a directional vector of the tangent at<br>
this point and a directional vector of the tangent to<br>
the midpoint not to be included in the range [45°;<br>
135°] .<br>
It is possible for a line portion to be conformal,<br>
i.e. for it to have a form matching the non-rectilinear<br>
form of its support, and for a processing of the<br>
signals of the modules to make this line portion<br>
equivalent to a rectilinear line portion. It is in<br>
particular possible to apply such a processing<br>
operation to a line portion attached to the surface of<br>
the keelson, a wing or a tail unit of an airplane. The<br>
processing of conformal antennas is a technique known<br>
to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The two line portions can be separated by any<br>
distance on the condition that the target or the source<br>
is in the far field of the two sub-antennas, which is<br>
defined by a person skilled in the art for each sub-<br>
antenna as the ratio of the square of the rectilinear<br>
length of the antenna to the lowest wavelength used by<br>
the antenna.<br>
The two line portions can be arranged at a<br>
sufficient distance separating them so that a coupling<br>
between their sensors would be weak. However, the two<br>
line portions can be secants; there can be:<br>
-	one sensor common to the two line portions: this<br>
means that the correlation coefficient for this sensor<br>
is reduced to its autocorrelation coefficient;<br>
-	a hole in one of the two line portions: this<br>
case corresponds to gap antennas, which are known per<br>
se to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Although only these types of antennas have been<br>
shown in the various figures, it is also possible to<br>
apply an antenna having a sensor array, for example<br>
with a rectangular shape, to the invention. The array<br>
is then divided into portions of sub-antennas as<br>
defined above. It is possible in particular to define a<br>
plurality of lines and columns and to calculate the<br>
correlation coefficients for a plurality of line-column<br>
pairs. It is also possible to consider more than two<br>
sub-antenna portions having orientations as defined<br>
above and not forming an array, and to calculate<br>
correlation coefficients for a plurality of pairs of<br>
these sub-antenna portions. The calculations of the<br><br>
correlation coefficients for various pairs can be<br>
crossed to enhance the performance of the antenna.<br>
In a sonar application, a passive antenna, of<br>
which the sensors are hydrophones, or an active antenna,<br>
of which the sensors are transducers, can be used. The<br>
processing device forming the combined signal in<br>
particular performs a channel-forming function.<br>
In an application of the antenna to a radar, an<br>
antenna is used for reception and the sensors of the<br>
modules are suitable for detecting radar signals. The<br>
processing device forming the combined signal in<br>
particular performs a beam-forming function.<br>
To perform the calculation of the time correlation<br>
coefficient of complex video signals (for example, TSi<br>
and TGj in the example of figure 1) , particularly-<br>
suitable for a radar application, the coefficients of<br>
[Cij] can be calculated as follows:<br>
Let X(t) and Y(t) be complex, random, non-periodic,<br>
centred and stationary signals of the second order. The<br>
correlation function of the two signals is defined as<br>
the mathematical expectation of the product of X(t) by<br>
the conjugated complex of Y(t-x), x being the time<br>
shift between the two signals.<br><br>
In the case of ergodic signals, the correlation<br>
function verifies the following equation:<br><br><br>
In practice, the integral is calculated over a<br>
finite time interval that corresponds to the<br>
integration time.<br>
A person skilled in the art will know to adapt the<br>
formulas to the cases of periodic signals, uncentred or<br>
not verifying all of the statistical properties cited<br>
above.<br>
The normalised correlation function between<br>
the two signals is defined as follows:<br><br>
The use of normalised correlation coefficients<br>
makes it possible to detect a target without being<br>
concerned about the differences in levels between X and<br>
Y.<br>
Because the correlation function moves toward zero<br>
when x moves toward infinity, it is considered in<br>
practice that the time shift x is bounded. For example,<br>
if x is between the time interval [-x max, x max] , then<br>
there is a value x0 of x for which the normalised<br>
correlation function reaches its maximum CXY/ the<br>
maximum correlation function between the two linear<br>
sub-antennas.<br><br><br>
The time shift T0 is determined by the shape of<br>
the antenna. In the case of two identical linear sub-<br>
antennas that are secants at their centre, the maximum<br>
CXy is reached for x0 = 0.<br>
The maximum correlation coefficients Cij are<br>
obtained by replacing the random signals X(t) and Y(t)<br>
with the useful combined signals as defined above TSi<br>
and TGj . The correlation coefficients Cij therefore<br>
form a matrix [Cij] of which the values are between 0<br>
and 1.<br>
A maximum correlation coefficient value Cij above<br>
a predefined correlation threshold means that at least<br>
one source or one target is detected at the virtual<br>
intersection of the directivity lobes of the two linear<br>
sub-antennas 2i and 3j . In the case of figure 1, the<br>
presence of a source or target is determined at the<br>
intersection of the elevation angle i and the bearing j.<br>
Another calculation method, based on the use of<br>
real combined signals, makes it possible to simplify<br>
the calculation step. The correlation coefficients are<br>
then determined, by considering the correlation<br>
function in the following way:<br><br>
This method makes it possible to obtain<br>
correlation coefficients directly from the signal<br><br>
strengths by simply performing addition or subtraction<br>
operations.<br>
In addition, it is possible to consider excluding<br>
signals that are too weak from the detection. Thus, it<br>
is possible to first calculate the denominator of the<br>
normalised correlation function mentioned above, and to<br>
compare it with a minimum threshold. When the<br>
denominator of the normalised correlation function is<br>
smaller than the minimum threshold, the corresponding<br>
correlation coefficient is not taken into account for<br>
the detection, which amounts to giving it a zero value.<br>
It is also possible to significantly reduce the<br>
integration time necessary for similar performances.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to compare each<br>
threshold of the denominator to a respective threshold.<br>
To ensure an optimal result, it is desirable for<br>
the acquisition of the signals used for the correlation<br>
calculation to be synchronous.<br>
Although a correlation calculation solution has<br>
been described in the time domain, it is also possible<br>
to consider calculating correlation coefficients in the<br>
frequency domain, for example for an application in a<br>
sonar. The correlation coefficients in the frequency<br>
domain can be determined from the coherence function<br>
defined as follows.<br>
The Fourier transforms of the correlation<br>
functions of two signals X and Y defined above are<br>
inter-spectral densities (or interaction spectral<br>
densities).<br>
Fourier transform (correlationXY) (f) = SXY(f)<br><br>
Similarly, the Fourier transforms of the<br>
correlation functions of signals X and Y defined above<br>
are power spectral densities of signals X and Y.<br>
Fourier transform (correlation^) (f) = SXx(f)<br>
Fourier transform (correlation^) (f) = SyyCf)<br>
The coherence function between X and Y is defined<br>
by:<br><br>
The calculation of the coherence coefficients is<br>
generalised for all frequency bands of analysis Bf. In<br>
this case, the calculation of the coherence function<br>
becomes:<br><br>
It is possible for the antenna processing devices<br>
4 and 5 to weigh the basic signals of the sensors<br>
according to differences in directivity or sensitivity,<br>
before performing the combination (for example, linear)<br>
of these signals.<br>
The antenna processing devices can also include an<br>
adaptive processing, which is intended to eliminate a<br>
parasitic signal, such as that coming from a jammer or<br>
any other processing enabling the functionalities and<br><br>
performances of the antenna and the associated data<br>
processing to be improved.<br>
The signal processing devices 6 and 7 for the<br>
combined signals can perform: bandpass filtering,<br>
Doppler or MTI filtering, pulse compression processing<br>
operations or angle-error measurements or any other<br>
processing operation enabling the functionalities and<br>
performances of the antenna and the associated data<br>
processing to be improved.<br>
Although not shown, it is possible for the antenna<br>
to include suitable data processing stages, providing<br>
the appropriate information to the operators. In<br>
general, the calculation of the correlation<br>
coefficients will preferably be performed after an<br>
antenna processing step and a signal processing step,<br>
the calculation of the correlation coefficients will<br>
generally be followed by a thresholding and information<br>
processing step.<br>
The information processing stages, corresponding<br>
to the devices 8 to 10 in figure 1, are intended, for<br>
example, to detect, locate or display the presence of a<br>
source or target.<br>
In the case of discrete signals, the calculation<br>
of the correlation coefficients can be performed on a<br>
number N of useful combined signal samples. A person<br>
skilled in the art will determine the number of samples<br>
necessary according to the desired probabilities of<br>
detection and false alarms.<br>
For example, in the time domain, N time samples of<br>
complex signals X and Y are considered, and it is<br>
/ hypothesised that the maximum CXY is reached for x0 = 0.<br><br><br>
If the signals that are too weak are eliminated by<br>
performing a test on the denominator as described above,<br>
then the number of samples N can be significantly<br>
reduced for similar performances with regard to the<br>
probability of false alarms and detection.<br>
Comparative trials and studies have been performed.<br>
The antenna according to the invention has two<br>
perpendicular straight line portions each consisting of<br>
25 modules, i.e. a total of 50 modules. The reference<br>
antenna has an array of 100 modules distributed over a<br>
square surface. The antennas have been compared in<br>
studies according to three types of target known to a<br>
person skilled in the art: a nonfluctuating target, a<br>
slowly fluctuating target and a rapidly fluctuating<br>
target. For the trials, the transmitter used includes a<br>
synthesiser transmitting a signal at 9,345 GHz, cut<br>
into pulses by a switch. The antenna channels were<br>
transposed in frequency and numbered at a sampling<br>
frequency of 1 MHz. The detection capabilities of the<br>
antennas were tested according the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio by pointing the antennas in the direction of the<br>
transmitter. The capabilities of the antennas for<br>
rejecting targets outside of the detection lobe were<br>
also tested by mispointing the antenna in bearing. The<br>
influence of a jammer (significant background noise<br><br>
generator) near the transmitter was also tested. The<br>
jammer was simulated by a frequency modulation of the<br>
synthesiser.<br>
All other things being equal, the two antennas<br>
obtain the same probability of detection when the<br>
number of samples N of the antenna of the invention<br>
with the denominator test method is 4 times greater<br>
than that of the reference antenna, for a<br>
nonfluctuating or slowly fluctuating target; for a<br>
rapidly fluctuating target, the antenna of the<br>
invention with the denominator test method obtains a<br>
better probability of detection when the number of<br>
samples N is 4 times greater than that of the reference<br>
antenna. This improvement i the performance of the<br>
antenna of the invention with the denominator test<br>
method can be demonstrated with by the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio necessary for obtaining a detection probability<br>
of 0.9 when the false alarm probability is 1(T4, 6dB<br>
lower than that of the reference antenna.<br>
In addition, for a number of modules reduced by<br>
half, the antenna of the invention makes it possible to<br>
achieve the same performance with respect to the<br>
probability of detection and the probability of false<br>
alarms as for the reference antenna. It is also<br>
understood that this performance of the antenna of the<br>
invention would be substantially better than that of a<br>
reference antenna having the same number of modules, on<br>
the condition that the level of the secondary lobes is<br>
sufficiently reduced with respect to that of the main<br>
lobe.<br><br>
Theoretically, the calculation of correlation<br>
coefficients is comparable to a non-coherent<br>
integration, which is distinguished from the coherent<br>
integrations normally performed on antennas. The non-<br>
coherent detection can be extended over a longer time<br>
than the coherent integration. The secondary lobes<br>
associated with the antenna processing of the invention<br>
are thus randomly distributed over the perpendicular<br>
plane of the central lobe (in the example, the<br>
elevation angle-bearing plane) and not<br>
deterministically. It is therefore noted, as shown in<br>
figures 2 to 4, that the antenna does not lock on to a<br>
target on the secondary lobes.<br>
The antenna of the invention also has a resolution<br>
2.5 times superior to that of the reference antenna,<br>
due to the greater length of the line portions with<br>
respect to the sides of the square of the reference<br>
antenna.<br>
The method for testing the denominator of the<br>
correlation coefficient has made it possible in<br>
practice to reduce the necessary number of samples for<br>
a given performance level by 3.<br>
Figures 2 to 4 show the detection diagram Dl of a<br>
conventional antenna, compared with the diagrams D2 and<br>
D3 of a cross antenna, in different cases. Dl<br>
corresponds to the diagram generated by the reference<br>
antenna, D2 to the diagram generated by the antenna<br>
according to the invention, and D3 is the diagram<br>
obtained from D2 after thresholding.<br>
Figure 2 identifies the location performance in<br>
the presence of a single target. It is noted that<br><br>
diagrams D2 and D3 have a very clear trace around the<br>
target 91 detected. By contrast, the secondary lobes of<br>
the conventional antenna give an unclear contour of the<br>
target 91 in diagram Dl.<br>
Figure 3 identifies the location performance in<br>
the presence of a single target and a jammer in the<br>
vicinity. It is noted in diagrams D2 and D3 that the<br>
target 91 and the jammer 92 are properly located. It is<br>
also noted that the trace of the target and the j ammer<br>
are much clearer in D2 and D3 than in Dl.<br>
Figure 4 identifies the location performance in<br>
the presence of two targets 93 and 94. It is noted that<br>
D2 and D3 have a superior resolution to that of Dl. D2<br>
and D3 enable the two targets 93 and 94 to be<br>
distinguished, unlike in Dl.<br>
In order for the presence of a jammer in the same<br>
location as the target not to reduce the location<br>
performance of the antenna, the latter can perform the<br>
following steps, locate the jammer and point to it,<br>
measure the signal coming from the jammer, subtract<br>
this signal from signals subsequently measured by the<br>
modules. The tilt of the linear sub-antennas, for<br>
example by 45° with respect to their initial axis, also<br>
makes it possible to reduce the influence of a jammer<br>
on the measurements.<br>
Although the invention appears to be particularly<br>
advantageous for radar sensors, it can of course be<br>
applied to antennas of which the elementary sensors are<br>
hydrophones, microphones, transducers, radioelectric<br>
sensors, electromagnetic sensors, ultrasound sensors,<br>
accelerometers, or optical or infrared sensors.<br><br>

in the aeronautical field for detecting obstacles or<br>
objects, or for providing an image thereof.<br>

submarine field for detecting obstacles or submarine<br>

field of space for detecting, from the sky, or even<br>

or mobile objects.<br>

seismological field for detecting, or even providing an<br>
image of, solid, liquid or gaseous objects embedded in<br>
or under the earth's surface.<br>
It is also possible to use the invention in the<br>
medical field in order to detect, or even provide an<br>
image of, living beings or solid, liquid or gaseous<br>
objects located inside the human body.<br>

field of security, for example, on the ground, for<br>
detecting, or even providing an image of, intrusions in<br>
a protected space.<br>
It is also possible to use the invention in the<br>
maritime field for detecting, or even providing an<br>
image of, surface vessels.<br><br>

field of aeronautical security for detecting, or even<br>
providing an image of, aircraft navigating around a<br>
sensitive zone, such as, for example, airports, nuclear<br>
centres and protected buildings.<br>
The invention can be used, for example, in the<br>
field of ground navigation (for example, automobile),<br>
naval navigation (for example, boat), submarine<br>
navigation (for example submarine), or aeronautical<br>
navigation (for example, airliner) for detecting, or<br>
even providing an image of, non-visible obstacles, and<br>
thus improve their security.<br>
The invention can be used, for example, in the<br>
field of earth-space or submarine communications, in<br>
order to increase the number of communication channels<br>
and enhance the reception thereof.<br>
