				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF MOLECULAR SIEVE ADSORBENT<br>
FOR SELECTIVE ADSORPTION OF NITROGEN AND ARGON<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a molecular sieve<br>
adsorbent for selectively adsorbing nitrogen and argon from a gaseous mixture with<br>
oxygen.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
Adsorption processes for the separation of oxygen and nitrogen from air are being<br>
increasingly used for commercial purposes for the last three decades. Oxygen<br>
requirements in sewage treatment, fermentation, cutting and welding, fish breeding,<br>
electric furnaces, pulp bleaching, glass blowing, medical purposes and in the steel<br>
industries particularly when the required oxygen purity is 90 to 95% is being largely met<br>
by adsorption based pressure swing or vacuum swing processes. It is estimated that at<br>
present, 4-5% of the world's oxygen demand is met by adsorptive separation of air.<br>
However, the maximum attainable purity by adsorption processes is around 95% with<br>
separation of 0.934 mole percent argon present in the air being a limiting factor to<br>
achieve 100% oxygen purity. Furthermore, the adsorption-based production of oxygen<br>
from air is economically not competitive to cryogenic fractionation of air for production<br>
levels more than 100 tonne oxygen per day. Of the total cost of the oxygen production by<br>
adsorption processes, it is estimated that capital cost of equipment and power<br>
consumption are the two major factors influencing the overall cost with their share being<br>
50% and 40% respectively. Along with the factors like process and system design, the<br>
adsorbent is the key component, which can bring down the cost of oxygen production by<br>
adsorption. The adsorbent selectivity and capacity are important parameters for<br>
determining the size of the adsorption vessels, compressors or vacuum pumps. It is<br>
desirable to have an adsorbent, which shows a high adsorption capacity as well as<br>
selectivity for nitrogen compared to oxygen. The improvement in these properties of the<br>
adsorbent directly results in lowering the adsorbent inventory of a system and hence the<br>
size and power consumption of the air compressor or vacuum pump. Furthermore,<br>
adsorbent having a high nitrogen capacity and selectivity can also be used to produce<br>
reasonably pure nitrogen along with oxygen by evacuating nitrogen adsorbed on the<br>
1<br>
adsorbent. Furthermore, adsorbents having both nitrogen and argon selectivity over<br>
oxygen can be used for producing high purity (&gt;96%) oxygen from air.<br>
It is, therefore, highly desirable, for an adsorbent to have good adsorption capacity and<br>
adsorption selectivity for a particular component sought to be separated.<br>
Adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is defined as the amount in terms of volume or<br>
weight of the desired component adsorbed per unit volume or weight of the adsorbent.<br>
The higher the adsorbent's capacity for the desired components the better is the adsorbent<br>
as the increased adsorption capacity of a particular adsorbent helps to reduce the amount<br>
of adsorbent required to separate a specific amount of a component from a mixture of<br>
particular concentration. Such a reduction in adsorbent quantity in a specific' adsorption<br>
process brings down the cost of a separation process.<br>
The adsorption selectivity of a component results from steric factors such as the<br>
differences in the size and shape of the adsorbate molecules; equilibrium effect, i.e. when<br>
the adsorption isotherms of components of a gas mixture differ appreciably; kinetic<br>
effect, when the components have substantially different adsorption rates.<br>
It is generally observed that for a process to be commercially economical, the minimum<br>
acceptable adsorption selectivity for the desired component is about 3 and when the<br>
adsorption selectivity is less than 2, it is difficult to design an efficient adsorption<br>
process.<br>
In the prior art, adsorbent which are selective for nitrogen from its mixture with oxygen<br>
and argon have been reported wherein the zeolites of type A, X and mordenite have been<br>
used after ion exchanging alkali and /or alkaline earth metal ions. However, the<br>
adsorption selectivity reported for the commercially used zeolite A based adsorbents for<br>
this purpose varies from 3 to 5 and adsorption capacity from 12-15 cc/g at 765 mmHg<br>
and 30°C. The efforts to enhance the adsorption capacity and selectivity have been<br>
reported by increasing the number of exchangeable cations into the zeolite structure by<br>
modifying the chemical composition of the zeolite. The adsorption selectivity for<br>
nitrogen has also been substantially enhanced by exchanging the zeolite with cations like<br>
lithium and / or calcium in some zeolite types.<br>
Zeolite A having a specific amount of calcium has been commercially used for oxygen<br>
production from air by selectively adsorbing nitrogen. However, presently used adsorbent<br>
has the following limitations:<br>
• Low adsorption capacity compared to other commercially used adsorbents.<br>
• Low adsorption selectivity.<br>
• It gives oxygen with only 95% maximum purity.<br>
• Sensitivity to moisture.<br>
• It needs multiple exchange with calcium salt.<br>
• The activation of the adsorbent requires much care, in order to prevent the<br>
hydroxylation.<br>

separating multi component gas mixture in "Separation of gases by pressure swing<br>
adsorption"; Separation Science and Technology, 26(7), pp. 885-930, 1991, The<br>
application of a new generation of adsorbents were described in detail. In "Adsorption of<br>
a Nitrogen-Oxygen mixture in NaCaA zeolites by elution Chromatography", Ind. Eng.<br>
Chem. Res. 1993, 32, 548-552, N. V. Choudary et al. describes the influence of calcium<br>
content on adsorption of nitrogen and oxygen is studied on various NaCaA zeolite<br>
samples. N. V. Choudary et al. describes the adsorption and desorption of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and argon in mordenite type zeolite having different Si/Al ratios in 'Sorption of<br>
nitrogen, oxygen and argon in mordenite type zeolites', Indian Journal of Chemistry Vol.<br>
38A January 1999, pp.34-39. The heat of adsorption of nitrogen and argon in mordenite,<br>
NaA and NaX were compared to revels the sorbate interactions with extra-frame work<br>
sodium ions as well as lattice oxygen atoms.<br>

The invention is further explained in the form of the following embodiments:<br>
Zeolites, which are microporous crystalline alumna-silicates, are finding increased<br>
applications as adsorbents for separating mixtures of closely related compounds. Zeolites<br>
have a three dimensional network of basic structural units consisting SiO4 and A1O4<br>
tetrahedrons linked to each other by sharing apical oxygen atoms. Silicon and aluminum<br>
atoms lie in the center of the tetrahedral. The resulting alumino-silicate structure, which<br>
is generally highly porous, possesses three-dimensional pores the access to which is<br>
through molecular sized windows. In a hydrated form, the preferred zeolites are generally<br>
represented by the following formula,<br>
M2/nO.Al2O3.xSiO2.wH2O<br>
where M is a cation, which balances the electrovalence of the tetrahedral and is generally<br>
referred to as extra framework exchangeable cation, n represents the valancy of the cation<br>
and x and w represents the moles of SiO2 and water respectively. The cation may be any<br>
one of the numbers of cations, which will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
The attributes which makes the zeolites attractive for separation include, an unusually<br>
high thermal and hydrothermal stability, uniform pore structure, easy pore aperture<br>
modification and substantial adsorption capacity even at low adsorbate pressures.<br>
Furthermore, zeolites can be produced synthetically under relatively moderate<br>
hydrothermal conditions.<br>
X-ray powder diffraction data was collected using PHILIPS X'pert MPD system<br>
equipped with XRK 900 reaction chamber. Comparing the X-ray diffraction data with<br>
literature X-ray data checked the crystallinity of the adsorbent particles. The X-ray<br>
diffraction at "d" values 12.1925, 5.489, 4.086, 3.2818, 2.9773 and 2.7215 were used for<br>
comparison.<br>
The zeolite NaA powder [Nai2(AlO2)i2.(SiO2)i2-wH2O] was used as the starting material.<br>
X-ray diffraction data showed that the starting material was highly crystalline. The<br>
zeolite NaA was mixed with a specified concentration of aqueous silver salt solutions in<br>
the ratio 1:80 and treated at 30-90°C for 4-8 hours in the dark. The residue was filtered,<br>
washed with hot distilled water, until the washings were free from silver ions (tested with<br>
sodium chloride solution) and dried at room temperature to 80°C in air and also under<br>
vacuum conditions as specified in the examples. The silver exchange completes in a<br>
single step since the equilibrium of the cation exchange reaction favors the easy<br>
formation of the product. The extent of silver exchange was determined by Atomic<br>
Absorption Spectroscopy.<br>
Oxygen, nitrogen and argon adsorption at 15°C and 30°C was measured using a static<br>
volumetric system (Micromeritics ASAP 2010), after activating the sample at 350°C to<br>
450°C under vacuum for 4 hours as described in the Examples. Addition of the adsorbate<br>
gas was made at volumes required to achieve a targeted set of pressures ranging from 0.5<br>
to 850mmHg. A minimum equilibrium interval of 5 seconds with a relative target<br>
tolerance of 5.0% of the targeted pressure and an absolute target tolerance of 5.000<br>
mmHg were used to determine equilibrium for each measurement point. The adsorption<br>
and desorption are completely reversible, hence it is possible to remove the adsorbed<br>
gases by simple evacuation.<br>
The heat of adsorption was calculated using the following equation<br>
Heat of adsorption, AadH° = R {[d\np]/[d(l/T)]}6<br>
where R is the universal gas constant, 0 is the amount of gas adsorbed at a pressure/? and<br>
temperature T. A plot of \np against 1/T should be a straight line of slope AadH°/R.<br>
The selectivity of two gases A and B is given by the equation,<br>
aA/B=[VA/VB] P, T<br>
where VA and VB are the volumes of gas A and B adsorbed at any given pressure P and<br>
temperature T.<br>
The important inventive steps involved in the present invention are that the molecular<br>
sieve adsorbent obtained, (i) is prepared by a single stage ion exchange process using<br>
aqueous solution of any silver salt in a temperature range of room temperature to 90°C,<br>
(ii) is stable during the activation process, hydroxylation chance is very low and hence<br>
the activation process does not requre very slow heating, (iii) has a brick red / orange red<br>
colour afer the activation, which changes with decay of the adsorption capacity and<br>
selectivity due to the presence of moisture in the feed gas mixture, (iv) has adsorption<br>
capacity and selectivity for nitorgen is maximum reported for any zeolite A based<br>
adsorbent so far and (v) has argon selectivity over oxygen, which will be useful for the<br>
production of oxygen with purity higher than 96%.<br>

and refluxed at 80°C for 4 hours. The residue is filtered, washed with hot distilled water,<br>
until the washings are free from silver ions (tested with sodium chloride solution) and<br>
dried in vacuum oven at 60°C. Elemental analysis shows the chemical composition of the<br>
adsorbent is (Ag2O)5.4. (Na2O)o.6.(Al2O3)6.(SiO2)i2.wH2O. X-ray diffraction data shows<br>
that the material is highly crystalline. A known amount of the sample was activated at<br>
450°C under vacuum and adsorption measurements were carried out as described earlier.<br>
The colour of the sample became brownish black after activating at 450°C. The<br>
adsorption capacity for nitrogen is 22.1cc/g at 30°C and 765mmHg and selectivity for<br>
nitrogen over oxygen is 5.1 to 14.2 in the pressure range studied, values are given in<br>
table-1, which are very high compared to the commercially using zeolite A based<br>
adsorbent. The heat of adsorption values, given in table-2 and the shape of desorption<br>
curve shows that the adsorption is physisorption and completely reversible.<br>
ExampIe-18<br>
The zeolite NaA powder [Nai2(AlO2)i2-(SiO2)i2-wH2O] was used as the starting material.<br>
5.0g of the molecular sieve NaA powder was mixed thoroughly with 5.0g AgNOs and<br>
heated up to 575°C under helium in a programmable tabular furnace with a heating rate<br>
of l0C/min and the temperature was maintained at 575°C for 4 hours. The material is<br>
washed with hot distilled water, until the washings are free from silver ions (tested with<br>
sodium chloride solution) and dried in air at room temperature (28°C). Elemental analysis<br>
shows the chemical composition of the adsorbent is (Ag2O)s 5.(Na2O)<br>
o.5.(Al2O3)6.(SiO2)i2.wH2O. X-ray diffraction data shows that the material is highly<br>
crystalline. A known amount of the sample was activated at 350°C under vacuum and<br>
adsorption measurements were carried out as described earlier. The colour of the sample<br>
became brick red after activating at 350°C. The adsorption capacity for nitrogen is<br>
21.3cc/g at 30°C and 765mmHg and selectivity for nitrogen over oxygen is 5.0 to 12.8 in<br>
the pressure range studied, values are given in table-1, which are very high compared to<br>
the commercially using zeolite A based adsorbent. The heat of adsorption values, given<br>
in table-2 and the shape of desorption curve shows that the adsorption is physisorption<br>
and completely reversible.<br>
Example-19<br>
The zeolite NaA powder [Nai2(AlO2)i2.(SiO2)i2.wH2O] was used as the starting material.<br>
25.Og of the molecular sieve NaA powder was mixed with 0.05M AgNOs solutions in the<br>
ratio 1:80 and refluxed at 80°C for 4 hours. Decanted and the procedure was repeated<br>
once again to ensure the complete ion exchange. The residue is filtered, washed with hot<br>
distilled water, until the washings are free from silver ions (tested with sodium chloride<br>
solution) and dried in air at room temperature (28°C). Elemental analysis shows the<br>
chemical composition of the adsorbent is (Ag2O)5.6.(Na2O)o.4-(Al2O3) 6-(SiO2)i2.wH2O.<br>
X-ray diffraction data shows that the material is highly crystalline. A known amount of<br>
the sample was activated at 350°C under vacuum and adsorption measurements were<br>
carried out as described earlier. The colour of the sample became brick red after<br>
activating at 350°C. The adsorption capacity for nitrogen is 21.9cc/g at 30°C and<br>
765mmHg and selectivity for nitrogen over oxygen is 5.1 to 13.1 in the pressure range<br>
studied, values are given in table-1, which are very high compared to the commercially<br>
using zeolite A based adsorbent. The heat of adsorption values, given in table-2 and the<br>
shape of desorption curve shows that the adsorption is physisorption and completely<br>
reversible.<br>
The adsorption capacity and selectivity of all the 19 samples are enumerated in the Table-<br>
1 and the colour of the sample after activation and heat of adsorption for nitrogen, oxygen<br>
and argon are given in Table-2.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The adsorption capacity towards nitrogen is found to be 22.3cc/g at 30°C and 765 mmHg,<br>
which is the maximum reported for any zeolite A based adsorbent so far.<br>
The adsorption selectivity towards nitrogen is found to be 5.3 to!4.6 at 30°C in pressures<br>
range studied, which is the maximum reported for any zeolite A based adsorbent so far.<br>
The adsorbent shows argon selectivity (around 2 at 30°C) over oxygen, which is not<br>
generally observed in the case of zeolite-based adsorbents, and will be useful for the<br>
production of oxygen with purity higher than 96%.<br>
Selectivity of nitrogen as well as argon over oxygen, which is not generally observed in<br>
other commercial molecular sieve adsorbents.<br>
Brick red colour of the activated form of the adsorbent, which is sensitive to moisture, is<br>
helpful to find out easily whether the adsorbent is active.<br>
The preparation of the adsorbent is a very easy single step process compared to<br>
multistage cation exchange process commercially used.<br>
Since the chance for the hydroxylation is very low, the activation process of the<br>
adsorbent does not require much care compared to the commercially used ones.<br><br><br><br><br>
