FIELD OF THE<br>
The present invention generally relates to a process for producing a lo\v density detergent composition. More particuJarly, the invention is directed to a non-tower process during which 'low density detergent agglomerates are produced by hardening an aqueous surfactant paste by mixing said paste with a water absorbing material, and then mixing the hardened paste with other detergent ingredients so as to produce agglomerates. The process produces a free flowing, low density detergent composition which can be commercially sold as a conventional non-compact detergent composition or used as an admix in a low dosage, "compact" detergent product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, (here has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry-detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitale production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of 600 g/l or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers. However, the extent to which modern detergent products need to be "compact" in nature remains unsettled. Jn tact, many consumers, especially in developing countries, continue to prefer higher dosage levels in their respective laundering operations. One characteristic common to the existing process for producing modern detergent composition by agglomeration, namely, non-tower process, is that the apparent density of the granules by such process is typically not Jess than 600 g/l. Consequently, there is a need in the art of agglomeration (e.g., non-tower process) to produce modern detergent compositions for flexibility in the ultimate density of the final composition, especially for low density (for example, the range of the density is from about 300g/l to about 600 g/l).<br>
Generally, there are three primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules (e.g., tower process for low density detergent compositions), The second type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower as the first step, then, the resultant granules are<br>
agglomerated with a binder such as a noniom'c or anionic surfactant, and finally, various detergent components are dry mixed to produce detergent granules (e.g., tower process plus agglomeration process for high density detergent compositions). [n the third type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed after which they are agglomerated with a binder Such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant, to produce high density detergent compositions (e.g., agglomeration process for high density detergent compositions). In the above three processes, the important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the shape, porosity and particle size distribution of said granules, the density of the various starting materials, the shape of the various starting materials, and their respective chemical composition.<br>
There have been many attempts in the art for providing processes which increase the density of detergent granules or powders. Particular attention has been given to densificad'on of spray-dried granules by post tower treatment. For example, one attempt involves a batch process in which spray-dried or granulated detergent powders containing sodium tripolyphosphnte and sodium sulfate are densified and spheronized in a Marurncrizerd. This apparatus comprises a substantially horizontal, roughened, rotatable table positioned within and at the base of a substantially vertical, smooth walled cylinder. This process, however, is essentially a batch process and is therefore less suitable for the large scale production of detergent powders. More recently, other attempts have been made to provide continuous processes for increasing the density of "post-tower" or spray dried detergent granules. Typically, such processes require \\ first apparatus which pulverizes or grinds the granules and a second apparatus which increases the density of the pulverized granules by agglomeration. While these processes achieve the desired increase in density by treating or densifying "post tower" or spray dried granules, they are limited in their ability to go higher in surfactant active level without subsequent coating srep. In addition, treating or deusifying by "post tower" is not favourable in terms of economics (high capital cost) and complexity of operation. Moreover, all of the aforementioned processes are directed primarily for densifying or otherwise processing spray dried granules. Currently, the relative amounts and types of materials subjected to spray drying processes in the production of detergent granules has been limited. For example, it has been difficult to attain high levels of surfactant in the resulting detergent composition, a feature which facilitates production of detergents in a more efficient manner. Thus, it would be desirable to have a process by which detergent compositions can be produced vvithout having the limitations imposed by conventional spray drying techniques.<br>
To that end, the art is also replete-with disclosures of processes which entail agglomerating detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered silicates in a mixer to form free flowing<br>
agglomerates. While such attempts suggest that their process can be used to produce determent agglomerates, they do not provide a mechanism by which starting detergent materials in the form of pastes, liquids and dry materials can ho effectively agglomerated into crisp, free flowing detergent agglomerates having low densities.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art to have a non-tower process for producing a low density detergent composition directly from starting detergent ingredients. Also, there remains a need for .such a process which is more efficient, flexible and economical to facilitate large-scale production of detergents of low as well as high dosage levels.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in the art by providing a non-tower process which produces a low density granular detergent composition directly from an anionic surfactant paste and other conventional detergent ingredients. The process of the proposed invention has capability of adjusting the density of the granules of the composition bycontrolled hardening of the anionic surfactant paste to a specified degree of hardness, as measured by penetration values.

In addition, the process of the present invention is more efficient, economical and flexible with regard to the variety of detergent compositions which can be produced in the process. Moreover, the process is more amenable to environmental concerns in that it does not use spray drying towers which typically emit particulates and volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere.<br>
As used herein, the term "agglomerates" refers to particles formed by agglomerating raw materials with binder such as surfactants and or inorganic solutions / organic solvents and polymer solutions. All percentages used herein are expressed as "percent-by-weight" unless indicated otherwise.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a process for preparing a granular detergent composition having a low density (less than about 600 g/1), preferably from about 300 g/1 to 600 g/1, is provided. The process comprises the steps of: (a) mixing an anionic surfactant paste comprising from about 35% to about 85% anionic surfactant and from about 15% to about 65% water with a sufficient amount of a particulate water absorbing material to form a solid mass having a penetration value of from about 75 gf to about 4,000 gf, then (b) agglomerating the solid mass from the step (a) and an amount of one or more other detergent ingredients in a mixer so as to produce agglomerates having an anionic surfactant content of from about 12 % to about 60%.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention is directed to a process which produces free flowing granular detergent agglomerates having a low density of less than about 600 g/1, preferably from about 300 to about 600 g/1. The process produces low density detergent agglomerates from an anionic<br>
surfactant paste having a water content, of typically at least about 15%, generally from about 15 lo about 65 %, preferably ftom about 20 to about 60 %, more preferably from about 30 to about 50 %. The detergent agglomerates can be used as a detergent or as a detergent additive. It should be understood that the process described herein can be continuous depending upon the desired application.<br>
Process<br>
In the First Step of the process, an anionic surfactant paste (aqueous or non-aqueous), comprising from about 35% to about 85% anionic surfactant and from about 15 % to about 65% 'water is mixed with sufficient amount of a particular water absorbing material to form a solid mass having a penetration value of from about 75 gf to about 4,000 gf as measured according to a conventional penetrometer known to those skilled in the an (e.g., such as ASTM D 217-IP 50 or ISO 2137).<br>
Forming a solid mass, as used herein, means not only making a mass of the anionic surfactant paste having a property of plastic solids or highly viscous fluids, but also means (i) increasing the anionic surfactant paste's apparent viscosity, (ii) increasing the anionic surfactant paste's effective melting point, (iii) increasing the "hardness" of the anionic surfactant paste. In the present invention, the hardness of the anionic surfactant paste after the first step is expressed as penetration value.<br>
The mixing of the First Step can be accomplished in any type of equipment suitable for kneading plastic solids or highly viscous fluids. The penetration value which is given to the surfactant paste can be controlled by the equipment used for the mixing (e.g., the first step) and by the amount and the choice of water absorbing agent. A twin screw extruder such as that used as a plodder in the manufacture of soap bars is particularly suitable. Preferred examples of the twin screw extruder are: the CONTINUA-83, manufactured by Werner and Pfleiderer, and other twin screw extruders manufactured by such as Kurimoto Compounder or Reico Teledyne Compounder. The solid mass produced in the first step is sometimes referred to herein nr; "hardened paste".<br>
Fn the Second Step of the process, the solid mass (hardened paste) obtained by the first step and other detergent ingredients are fed into a mixer which can be used for an agglomeration and is known to those skilled in the art for agglomeration, then the contents in the mixer arc agglomerated so as to form detergent agglomerates having a density of less than about 600 g/1. As used herein, the phrase "other detergent ingredients" refers to ingredients selected from fine powders typically having an average diameter from 0.1 to 500 microns, preferably from about 1 to about 100 microns, or selected from the mixtures of the fine powders and optional ingredient;;<br><br>
selected from the group comprising such ay (i) other surfactants, (ii) adjunct detergent ingredients and (iii) the mixtures thereof.<br>
Generally speaking, to achieve the low density {less than about 600 g/1), preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 5 to about 30 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 5 m/s to about 22 m/s, the energy per unit mass in the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 12 kj/kg, more preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 5 to about 15 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 6 m/s to about 20 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 8 kj/kg, and most preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 5 to about 10 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 6 m/s to about 18 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 4.5 kj/kg.<br>
The examples of mixers for the second step can be any types of mixer known to the skilled in the art, as long as the mixer can maintain the above mentioned condition for the second step. An Example c;:n be Lodige CB Mixer manufactured by the Lodige company (Germany).<br>
The detergent agglomerates produced by the process preferably have an anionic surfactant level of from about 12% to about 60%, more preferably from about 25% to about 55%, i.e. they comprise up to about 88% other detergent ingredients (including the ingredient used for paste hardening). The agglomerates are irregular in shape and have a relatively high degree of intraparticle voids, both of which characteristics contribute to low density. The present process typically provides detergent agglomerates having a mean particle size of from about 200 microns to about 800 microns, and more preferably from about 300 microns to about 650 microns. As. used herein, the phrase "mean particle size" of agglomerates refers to average size of all particles that make up the agglomerate.<br>
The agglomerates having desired mean particle size can be obtained by screening the agglomeration from the second step, since the agglomerates from the second step may contain a relatively large amount of fines that have to be recycled, further agglomeration (i.e.. an additional mixing step) can be optionally used<br>
In this embodiment, after the solid mass and other detergent ingredients are fed into the first mixer and are agglomerated, the agglomerates and other liquid components (which are fully described in details hereinafter) can be added to the contents in one or more mixers (e.g., the second mixer, or the series of the second mixers) then the contents in this mixer are agglomerated so as to farm detergent agglomerates having a density of less than about 600 g/1. The examples of mixers for the second mix.er can be any types of mixer for agglomeration which are known to those skilled in the art. An example can be Lodige KM Mixer manufactured by the<br>
Lodige company (Germany) or Schugi Flexomic Mode! manufactured by the Schugi company (Netherlands).<br>
In the case that the process includes the second mixer, it surprisingly reduces the amount of excess recycle fines from the second step, compared to the amount of excess recycle fines due to common agglomeration processes known to the skilled in the art. The existence of excess fines leads to excessive recycle streams which disrupt the process and are therefore not economically favourable.<br>
Startng Deto'gent Materials<br>
The total amount of the surfactants for the present invention, which are included in the following detergent surfactants, other liquid compositions and adjunct detergent ingredients is generally from about 5 % to about 60 %, more preferably from about 12% to about 55 %, moro preferably, from about 15 % to about 45%, in total amount of the final product obtained by the process of the present invention. The surfactants which should be included in the above can be from any part of the process of the present invention., e.g., from either one of the first step or the second step, or both steps of the present invention.<br>

(Included in the term "alkyl" is the alky! portion of acyl groups.). Generally speaking, the water in the surfactant paste is as low as possible, while maintaining paste fluidity, since low moisture reads to a higher concentration of the surfactant in the finished agglomerates. In a preferred embodiment, the anionic surfactant paste comprises from about 35 % to about 85 % anionic surfactant, and from about 15 % to about 65 % water.<br>

If desired, the conventional nonionic and amphoteric surfactants such as the C12-C18 alkyl ethoxylates ("AE") including the so-called narrow peaked alkyl ethoxylaies and C6-C12 alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially cthoxylates and mixed eihoxy/propoxy), C10-C18 amine oxides, and the like, can also be included in the overall compositions. The C10-C18 N-alkyl polyhjdroxy fatty acid amides can also be used. Typical examples include the C12-C18 N-methylglucamides.

Optionall Process Steps<br>
One optional step in the process is drying, if it is desired to reduce level of moisture in the agglomerates from the second step. This can be accomplished by a variety of apparatus, well known to these skilled in the art. Fluid bed apparatus is preferred, and will be referred to as the dryer in the discussion which follows.<br>
In another optional step of the present process, the detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed dryer are further conditioned by additional cooling in cooling apparatus. The preferred apparatus for cooling is a fluid bed. Another optional process step involves adding a coating agent to improve floxvability and/or minimize over-agglomeration of the detergent composition in one or more of the following locations of the instant process: (1) the coating agent can be added directly after the fluid bed cooler or dryer; (2) the coating agent may be added between the<br>
fluid bed dryer and the fluid bed cooler; (3) the coating agent may ho added between the fluid bed dryer and a mixer for agglomeration (i.e., the first mixer or the second mi.xer in the second step) which is commonly known to those skilled in the art; and/or (4) the coating agent may be added directly to a mixer for agglomeration (i.e., the first mixer or the second mixer in the second step) which is commonly known to those skilled in the ait and the fluid bed dryer. Die coating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates. silicates, carbonates and mixcures thereof. The coating agent not only enhances the free flouability of the resulting detergent composition which is desirable by consumers in that it permits easy scooping for detergent during use, but also serves to control agglomeration by preventing or minimizing o'ver-agglomeration, especially when added directly to the mixer for agglomeration. As those skilled in the art are well aware, over-agglomeration can lead to very undesirable flow properties and aesthetics of the final detergent product.<br>
Optionally, the process can comprise the step of spraying an additional binder in the mixer(s) in the second step of the present invention or fluid bed dryers and/or fluid bed coolers. A binder is added for purposes of enhancing agglomeration by providing a "binding" or "sticking" agent for the detergent components. The binder is preferably selected from the group consisting of water, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, liquid silicates, pohethylcne glycoJ, polyvinyl pyrrolidone polyaerylates, citric acid and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binder materials including those listed herein are described in Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble Co.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other optional steps contemplated by the present process include screening the oversized detergent agglomerates in a screening apparatus which can take a variety of forms including but not limited to conventional screens chosen for the desired particle size of the finished detergent product. Other optional steps include conditioning of the detergent agglomerates by subjecting the agglomerates to additional drying by way of apparatus discussed previously.<br>
Another optional step of the instant process entails finishing the resulting detergent agglomerates by a variety of processes including spraying and/or admixing other conventional detergent ingredients. For example, the finishing step encompasses spraying perfumes, brighteners and enzymes onto the finished agglomerates to provide a more complete detergent composition. Such techniques and ingredients are well known in the art.<br>
The representative examples of the series of mixers to make granular detergent compositions according to the process of the present invention plus optional processes are as follows:<br>
