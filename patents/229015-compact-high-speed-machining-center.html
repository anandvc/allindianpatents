FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a compact, vertical, high-speed production center. This vertical machining center has an unique configuration of side mounted tool magazine and high productivity features.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Demand for compact vertical machining centre with better productivity features such as high spindle speeds, higher rapid traverse rates and faster tool change is increasing in manufacturing sectors for smaller components of auto sector. This is gaining importance to reduce the cost of floor space and for multiple machines operation by single operator.<br>
DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART<br>
U.S patent 5,927,463 discloses a vertical machining center with a vertical pallet capable of clamping a horizontal pallet. U.S. Patent 5,885,199 talks about a compact machining center for multifunction, having to do with a metal cutting machine tool. Both of these inventions do no have the re-arrangement of the ATC atop the machining center and other features to ensure compactness, that are a part of this invention.<br>
There have been a number of vertical machining certers described and claimed in various patents throughout the world. However, the need to devise a compact machining center, which has, not only better features but also reduces the need for large floor area required for installation and which will avoid multiple operations to save time and energy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop a compact vertical machining center with a special automatic tool changer (ATC), which occupies minimum space without sacrificing the faster tool change by use of twin arm ATC. The machine is designed optimally for minimum width keeping enough space for maintenance.<br><br>
In the proposed system, all the elements and sub systems are mounted on the machine to facilitate lifting of machine as single unit.<br>
Further the use of high speed ATC (Refer Fig 4 - Numeral 6) with 1.3 sec tool to tool change time along with faster clamping and de-clamping of tool by use of high-pressure hydraulic booster system, higher rapid traverse rates, to achieve faster chip-to-chip time.<br>
Advantages of this machine:<br>
The compact high speed-machining centre combined with high productivity features provides the required advantage for lean manufacturing solution wherein single operator can handle multiple machines. This is possible due to compact design and also feasibility of machines arrangement with minimum space between them. The gap to be maintained between the machines arranged in the concept can be minimized as the chip disposal system is also arranged on the rear side of the machine, thereby maintaining minimum line length.<br>

•	A # 40 taper Spindle with 3.7/5.5 kW power and speed of 6000 RPM, shown in Fig. 4, part 15.<br>
•	A table capable of moving in two directions, shown in Fig. 5, part 16.<br>
•	Tool magazine mounted on the side of column with twin arm ATC, shown in Fig. 4, part 17, with a 1.3 sec tool change time. The tool magazine is capable of holding  75/  125 mm diameter, 200 mm long and maximum of 4 kg tool weight at every tool location.<br>
•	A chip disposal system, shown in Fig. 6, part 18, is interfaced with the machine at the rear end.<br>
•	A machine guard, shown in Fig. 4, part 19.<br>
•	An operator control panel in front of machine, shown in Fig. 4, part 20.<br>
•	An electrical cabinet mounted on the rear of column, shown in Fig. 5, part 21.<br>
•	For tool change operations, the tools are tilted by 30 degrees, shown in Fig. 4, part 21, to make the tool axis parallel to spindle axis.<br>
Three axes servo system with traverses of 350/300/350 mm in X/Y/Z axes and rapid traverse rate of 48 m/min with IG acceleration. All axes are protected by telescopic covers. In order to maintain compactness, these subsystems are innovatively arrangement such that machine width is maintained within 1400 mm for this size of machine with telescopic cover protection for all axes. This is possible due to newly developed side mounted special twin arm 12 tools ATC that occupies minimum space, as shown in Fig. 4, part 6. The tools are arranged at an angle of 30 degree to vertical position, as shown in Fig. 4, part 11 instead of standard 90 degree as in case of standard machines. During tool change the tool is tilted by 30 degree to make the tool axis<br><br>
parallel to spindle axis. This unique arrangement provided advantage of compactness in machine width.<br>
