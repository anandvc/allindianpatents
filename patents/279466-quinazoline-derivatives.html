				<td>The invention concerns certain novel quinazoline derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-cancer activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the prevention or treatment of cancers in a warm-blooded animal such as man, including use in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease.<br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for the abnormal cell growth found in cell proliferation diseases such as psoriasis and cancer utilise compounds which inhibit DNA synthesis. Such compounds are toxic to cells generally but their toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to anti-cancer agents which act by mechanisms other than the inhibition of DNA synthesis have the potential to display enhanced selectivity of action.<br>
Eukaryotic cells are continually responding to many diverse extracellular signals that enable communication between cells within an organism. These signals regulate a wide variety of physical responses in the cell including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The extracellular signals take the form of a diverse variety of soluble factors including growth factors as well as paracrine, autocrine and endocrine factors. By binding to specific transmembrane receptors, growth factor ligands communicate extracellular signals to the intracellular signalling pathways, thereby causing the individual cell to respond to extracellular signals. Many of these signal transduction processes utilise the reversible process of the phosphorylation of proteins involving specific kinases and phosphatases.<br>
As phosphorylation is such an important regulatory mechanism in the signal tra.usduction process, it is not surprising that aberrations hi the process result in abnormal cell differentiation, transformation and growth. For example, it has been discovered that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene. Se \eral such oncogenes encode proteins which are receptors for growth factors, for example tyrcsine kinase enzymes. Tyrosine kinases may also be mutated to constitutively active forms that result in the transformation of a variety of human cells. Alternatively, the over-expression of normal tyrosine kinase enzymes may also result in abnormal cell proliferation.<br>
 <br>
Tyrosine kinase enzymes may be divided into two groups :- the receptor tyrosine kinases and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases. About 90 tyrosine kinase have been identified in the human genome, of which about 60 are of the receptor type and about 30 are of the non-receptor type. These can be categorised into 20 receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families<br>
 according to the families of growth factors that they bind and into 10 non-receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families (Robinson et al, Oncogene. 2000,19,5548-5557). The classification includes the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF, TGFcc, Neu and erbB receptors, the insulin family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin and IGF1 receptors and insulin-related receptor QRR) and the Class in family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as<br>
the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinases, for example the PDGFcc and PDGF0 receptors, the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase (SCF RTK (commonly known as c-Kit), the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) receptor tyrosine kinase and the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) tyrosine kinase.<br>
It has been discovered that such mutated and over-expressed forms of tyrosine kinases<br>
 are present in a large proportion of common human cancers such as the leukaemias, breast cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancer of the lung, gastrointestinal cancer including colon, rectal and stomach cancer, bladder cancer, oesophageal cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. As further human tumour tissues are tested, it is expected that the widespread prevalence and relevance of tyrosine kinases will be further established. For example, it has been shown that EGFR tyrosine kinase is mutated and/or over-expressed in several human cancers including in tumours of (he lung, head and neck, gastrointestinal tract, breast, oesophagus, ovary, uterus, bladder and thyroid.<br>
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major mitogen for connective tissue cells and other cell types. The PDGF receptors comprising PDGFcc and PDGFp receptor isozymes display enhanced activity in blood vessel disease (for example atherosclerosis and restenosis, for example in the process of restenosis subsequent to balloon angioplasty and heart arterial by -pass surgery). Such enhanced PDGF receptor kinase activity is also observed in other cell protiferati ve disorders such as fibrotic diseases (for example kidney fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, lung fibrosis and multicystic renal dysplasia), glomerulonephritis, inflammatory diseases (for example rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis,<br>
 <br>
hypersensitivity reactions of the skin, allergic asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes, diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy.<br>
The PDGF receptors can also contribute to cell transformation in cancers and leukaemias by autocrine stimulation of cell growth. It has been shown that PDGF receptor 5 kinases are mutated and/or over-expressed in several human cancers including in tumours of the lung (non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer), gastrointestine (such as colon, rectal and stomach tumours), prostate, breast, kidney, liver, brain (such as glioblastoma), oesophagus, ovary, pancreas and skin (such as dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans) and in leukaemias and lymphomas such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), chronic ) myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), acute lymphocyte leukaemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma. Enhanced cell signalling by way of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases can contribute to a variety of cellular effects including cell proliferation, cellular mobility and inv asiveness, cell permeability and cellular apoptosis.<br>
Accordingly, antagonism of the activity of PDGF receptor kinases is expected to be i beneficial in the treatment of a number of cell proliferative disorders such as cancer, especially in inhibiting tumour growth and metastasis and in inhibiting the progression of leukaemia.<br>
In addition, PDGF is involved in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, mat is critical for continuing tumour growth. Normally, angiogenesis plays an important role in processes such as embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. However, undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with a number of disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma. Angiogenesis is stimulated via the promotion of the growth of endothelial cells. Several pol ypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of aFGF and bFGF, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recunl evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeability. This cytokine induces a vascular sprouting phenotype by inducing endothelial cell proliferation, protease expression and migration which subsequently leads to the formation of capillary tubes that promote the formation of the hyperpermeable, immature vascular network which is characteristic of pathological angiogenesis. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) sub-family that binds VEGF<br>
 <br>
comprises the kinase insert domain-containing receptor KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), the fins-tike tyrosine kinase receptor Flt-1 and the fins-like tyrosine kinase receptor Flt-4. Two of these related RTKs, namely Flt-1 and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity.<br>
Accordingly, antagonism of the activity of VEGF is expected to be beneficial in the 5 treatment of a number of disease states that are associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, especially in inhibiting the development of tumours.<br>
It is known that several compounds with PDGF receptor kinase inhibitory activity are progressing toward clinical development. The 2-anilinopyrimidine derivative known as imatinib (STI571; Nature Reviews. 2002,1,493-502; Cancer Research, 1996,56_, 100-104) has i been shown to inhibit PDGF receptor kinase activity although its current clinical use is for the treatment of CML based on its additional activity as an inhibitor of BCR-ABL kinase. STI571 inhibits the growth of glioblastoma tumours arising from injection into the brains of nude mice of the human glioblastoma lines U343 and U87 (Cancer Research. 2000,60,5143-5150). The compound also inhibits the in vivo growth of dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans cell cultures (Cancer Research. 2001,61,5778-5783). Based on the PDGF receptor kinase inhibitory activity of the compound, clinical trials are being carried out in glioblastoma and in prostate cancer. Several other PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors are being investigated including quinoline, quinazoline and quinoxaline derivatives fffitokfae ft Growth Factor Reviews. 2004,15,229-235).<br>
It is known from International Patent Application WO 92/20642 that certain aryl and heteroaryl compounds inhibit EOF and/or PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. There is the disclosure of certain quinazoline derivatives therein but no specific mention is made therein of 2-phenylacetamide derivatives; in particular, there is no specific mention made therein of qui nazoline-substituted 2-phenylacetamide derivatives.<br>
It is disclosed in many published patent applications that 4-anilinoquinazolines and 4-aayloxyquinazolines possess tyrosine kinase enzyme inhibitory activity. For example, International Patent Applications WO 96/09294, WO 96/15118 and WO 97/03069 are concerned with such compounds that are stated to possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory acti vity such as EOF (erbBl) and/or erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. For sxajnple, International Patent Applications WO 00/21955 and WO 00/47212 are concerned with such, compounds that possess antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing activity based on antagonism of the activity of VEGF. However, there is no specific mention therein of<br>
 <br>
2-phenylacetamide derivatives; in particular, there is no specific mention made therein of quinazoline-substituted 2-phenylacetamide derivatives.<br>
As stated above, although STI571 is the only compound with PDGF receptor kinase inhibitory activity that appears to have yet reached the market, that compound possesses approximately equipotent activity against various other kinase enzymes. There is still a need for further compounds with PDGF receptor kinase inhibitory activity that may be useful for the treatment of cell proliferation disorders such as cancer.<br>
We have now found that surprisingly certain novel quinazoline-substituted 2-phenylacetamide derivatives possess potent activity against cell proliferative disorders. It is believed that the compounds provide a useful treatment of cell proliferative disorders, for example to provide an anti-tumour effect, by way of a contribution from inhibition of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases.<br>
A further characteristic of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer is damage to the cellular pathways that control progress through the cell cycle which, hi normal eukaryotic cells, involves an ordered cascade of protein phosphorylation. As for signal transduction mechanisms, several families of protein kinases appear to play critical roles in the cell cycle cascade. The most widely studied of these cell cycle regulators is the cyclin dependent kinase family (the CDKs). Activity of specific CDKs at specific times is essential both to initiate and coordinate progress through the cell cycle. For example, the CDK4 protein appears to control entry into the cell cycle (the GO-G1-S transition) by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma gene product pRb which stimulates the release of the transcription factor E2F from pRb which, in turn, acts to increase the transcription of genes necessary for entry into S phase. The catalytic activity of CDK4 is stimulated by binding to a partner protein, Cyclin D. Outs of (he first demonstrations of a direct link between cancer and the cell cycle was made with the observation that the Cyclin Dl gene was amplified and Cyclin D protein levels increased in many human tumours.<br>
More recently, protein kinases that are structurally distinct from the CDK family have teen identified which play critical roles in regulating the cell cycle and which also appear to be im jortanl in oncogenesis. They include the human homologues of the Drosophila aurora and Ic-trevisiae Ipll proteins. The three human homologues of these genes Aurora-A, Aurora-B md Aurora-C encode cell cycle regulated serine-threonine protein kinases that show a peak of wqrxession and kinase activity through G2 and mitosis. Several observations implicate the nvolvement of human aurora proteins in cancer, especially Aurora-A and Aurora-B.<br>
 <br>
Abrogation of Aurora-A expression and function by antisense oligonucleotide treatment of human tumour cell lines leads to cell cycle arrest and exerts an anti-proliferative effect. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors of Aurora-A and Aurora-B have been demonstrated to have an anti-proliferative effect in human tumour cells.<br>
	It is disclosed in International Patent Applications WO 01/21594 and WO 01/21596<br>
that certain quinazoline derivatives that carry an anilino or phenoxy group linked to the<br>
4-position of the quinazoline ring possess Aurora kinase inhibitory activity. There is no<br>
mention therein of 2-phenylacetamide derivatives; in particular, there is no specific mention<br>
made therein of quinazoline-substituted 2-phenylacetamide derivatives.<br>
	It is disclosed in International Patent Applications WO 01/55116, WO 02/00649,<br>
WO 03/055491 and WO 04/058781 that certain quinazoline derivatives that cany a heteroaryl group linked to the 4-position of the quinazoline ring by, for example, a NH or O group possess Aurora kinase inhibitory activity. There is no mention therein of 2-phenylacetamide derivatives; in particular, there is no specific mention made therein of quinazoline-substituted i 2-phenylacetamide derivatives.<br>
As stated above, we have found that surprisingly certain novel quinazoline-substituted 2-phenylacetamide derivatives possess potent activity against cell proliferative dis orders. Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on one or two biological processes, it i s believed that the compounds provide a useful treatment of cell proliferative disorders, for example to provide an anti-tumour effect, by way of a contribution from inhibition of PDGF rec eptor tyrosine kinases. In particular, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention provide a useful treatment of cell proliferative disorders by way of a contribution fro m inhibition of the PDGFce and/or PDGF(5 receptor tyrosine kinases.<br>
Generally the compounds of the present invention possess potent inhibitory activity against the PDGF receptor family of tyrosine kinases, for example the PDGFcc and/or PDGF(3 rec eptor tyrosine kinases, and against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, for example KDR and Flt-l, whilst possessing less potent inhibitory activity against other tyrosine kinase enzymes such as the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, certain compounds of the present invention possess substantially better potency against the PDGF receptor family of tyrosine kin ases, particularly against the PDGFJ3 receptor tyrosine kinase, and against VE0F receptor<br>
| •<br>
tyrosine kinases, particularly again st KDR, than against EGF receptor tyrosine kiilase. Such<br>
 <br>
compounds possess sufficient potency that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit the PDGF receptor family of tyrosine kinases, particularly PDGFfi receptor tyrosine kinase, and to inhibit YEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly KDR, whilst demonstrating little activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>

example OC(R20)2O, that spans adjacent ring positions on Ring A. When Ring A is, for example, a phenyl group, a suitable group so formed is a 2,3-methylenedioxyphenyl or a 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl group. When a further optional R6 group is present, for example a halogeno group, a suitable group so formed is, for example, a 6-fluoro-23-methylenedioxyphenyl group.

The ability of test compounds to inhibit the phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing<br>
polypeptide substrate by the tyrosine kinase enzymes PDOFRoc, PDGFRJ3 and JKDR was<br>
assessed using conventional ELISA assays.	DNA encoding the PDOFRoc, PDGFRp or KDR receptor cytoplasmic tfomains may be<br>
obtained by total gene synthesis (International Biotechnology Lab.. 1987,5(3), 19-25) or by cloning. The DNA fragments may be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. For example, PDGFRcc, PDGFRJ3 and KDR receptor cytoplasmic domains, obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, can be shown to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor KDR<br>
 (Genbank Accession No. L04947), a DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 806 and including the termination codon may be cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector [for example pAcYMl (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L.A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)]. This recombinant construct<br>
may be co-transfected into insect cells [for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(Sf21) or Spodoptera frugiperda 9(Sf9)] with viral DNA (for example Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant<br>

Basis for another aspect of the invention arises from the disclosure in International Patent Application WO 01/74360 that VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, provided that they possess suitable pharmacokinetic properties which provide reasonable bioavailability, lead to a sustained increase in blood pressure when administered to warm-blooded animals, particularly when administered chronically. In general, the compounds of the present invention possess inhibitory activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases such as KIJR tyrosine kinase. Accordingly, it is expected that, in general, compounds of the present invention will cause a sustained increase in blood pressure when administered to a warm-blooded animal such as man. In order to attenuate such a hypertensive effect, the anti-cancer treatment defined hereinbefore may involve the administration, in addition to the quinazoline derivative of the invention, of a conventional anti-hypertensive agent. Such an anti-hypertensive agent may include one or more of the following categories of anti-hypertensive agents :-(i)       calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem and felodipine; (ii)      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Inhibitors) such as captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and qumapril;<br>

According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical product for use in the treatment of cancer which comprises a quinazoline derivative of the formula I as defined hereinbefore and an anti-hypertensive agent as defined hereinbefore.<br>
Although the compounds of the Formula I are primarily of value as therapeutic agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including man), they are also useful whenever it is required to inhibit the effects of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents.<br>

The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated to give an oil (25 g) which was shown by NMR analysis to be a mixture of 3-methyl-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (76%), unreacted starting material (~ 19%) and 3-bromomethyl-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (~ 15%). This mixture was used in the next step.<br>
A portion (15 g) of the oil so obtained was dissolved in methylene chloride (15 ml) and added slowly to a stirred mixture of cyciopropylamine (15.3 ml) and ethanol (15 ml) at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained below 40°C. The resultant reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 6 hours. The mixture was evaporated and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica using increasingly polar mixtures of methylene chloride and diethyl ether as eluent. There was thus obtained<br>

Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.78 g) was added portionwise to a stirred mixture of N-cyclopropyl-JV-(3-methyl-5-nitrobenzyl)amine (1.44 g), formaldehyde (37% aqueous solution, 0.81 ml), acetic acid (0.48 ml), methylene chloride (20 ml) and methanol (10 ml) and the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 2 hours. The mixture was evaporated and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica using increasingly polar mixtures of methylene chloride and diethyl ether as eluent. There was thus obtained ^K;yclopropyl-JV-methyl-Ar-(3-methyl-5-nitrobenzyl)amine (1.32 g); *H NMR: (QMSCd*) 0.35 (m, 2H), 0.46 (m, 2H), 1.77 (m, 1H), 2.17 (s, 3H), 2.42 (s, 3H), 3.7 (s, 2H), 7.54 (s, 1H), 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.95 (s, 1H); Mass Spectrum: M+IT" 221.<br>
A mixture of the material so obtained, platinum oxide (0.1 g), methanol (5 ml) and ethyl acetate (20 ml) was stirred under 1.8 atmospheres pressure of hydrogen for 2.5 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica using a solvent gradient from 5:5:0 to 5:5:1 of methylene chloride, ethyl acetate and 3M methanolic ammonia as eluent. There was thus obtained 3-(^-<yclopropyl-jv-methylaminomethyl g></yclopropyl-jv-methylaminomethyl>

The 2-{4-[7-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-6-methoxyquinazolin-4-yloxy]phenyl}acelic acid used as a starting material was prepared as follows :-<br>
Di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (16.42 g) was added portionwise to a stirred mixture of 4-chloro-7-hydroxy-6-memoxyquinazoline (10 g), 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)tetrahydropyran (7.72 ml), triphenylphosphine (18.71 g) and methylene chloride (500 ml) that was cooled to about 5°C. The resultant mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 2.5 hours. The mixture was evaporated and the residue was triturated under diethyl ether. The precipitated triphenylphosphine oxide was separated by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica using increasingly polar mixtures of petroleum ether (h.p. 40-60°C) and ethyl acetate as eluent. There was thus obtained 4-chloro-6-memoxy-7-(2-tetrahydropyran-2-yloxyethoxy)quinazoline (10 g).<br>
Using an analogous procedure to that described in the portion of Note [1] above that is concerned with the preparation of starting materials, 4-chloro-6-methoxy-7-(2-tetrahydropyran-2-yloxyethoxy)quinazoline was reacted with 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid to give<br>

M+H+ 455.<br>
A mixture of the material so obtained (9 g), glacial acetic acid (86 ml), water (50 ml) and THF (14 ml) was stirred and heated to 45°C for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water (850 ml) and the mixture was basified to pH3.5 by the addition of 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The resultant solid was isolated, washed with dieihyl ether and dried at 40°C under vacuum. There was thus obtained 2-{4-[7-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-6-methoxyquinazolin-4-yloxy]phenyl}acetic acid (5.8 g) which was used without further purification; Mass Spectrum: M+H* 371.<br>
