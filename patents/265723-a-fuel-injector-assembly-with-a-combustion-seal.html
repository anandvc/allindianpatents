COMBUSTION SEAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a combustion seal for a direct injection<br>
internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF TFIE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Recent advances in fuel delivery and combustion research have allowed<br>
direct injection, or DI, fuel delivery systems to increase in popularity. The DI fuel<br>
delivery system provides a fuel injector within the cylinder head of the internal<br>
combustion engine. The fuel injector operates to inject a predetermined amount of fuel<br>
directly into the combustion chamber at a predetermined time. The DI fuel delivery<br>
system enables higher power levels, improved fuel economy, and lower emissions.<br>
These beneficial aspects of the DI fuel delivery system are a result of the precise<br>
metering of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber as well as improved intake<br>
airflow into the combustion chamber.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A fuel injector assembly mountable within an injector bore defined by a<br>
cylinder head of an internal combustion engine is provided. The fuel injector includes a<br>
fuel injector body having an injector tip portion configured to be at least partially<br>
received within the injector bore. An annular groove is defined by the injector tip and<br>
is configured to receive a generally annular combustion seal subject to combustion gas<br>
pressures. The annular groove includes a generally tapering portion. The generally<br>
annular combustion seal is biased against the generally tapering portion of the annular<br>
groove when the generally annular combustion seal is subject to combustion gas<br>
pressures. The generally annular combustion seal is biased radially outward to<br>
sealingly engage the injector bore when the generally annular combustion seal is biased<br><br>
2<br>
against the generally tapering portion of the annular groove. A cylinder head assembly<br>
incorporating the fuel injector assembly is also disclosed.<br>
[0004]	In another embodiment, a cylinder head assembly for an internal<br>
combustion engine is provided. The cylinder head assembly includes a cylinder head at<br>
least partially defining a combustion chamber. An injector piloting sleeve is mounted<br>
within the cylinder head and defines an injector bore. A fuel injector assembly having<br>
an injector body and an injector tip portion is also provided. The injector tip portion is<br>
at least partially disposed within the injector bore and is in communication with the<br>
combustion chamber. An annular groove, having a generally tapering portion, is<br>
defined by the injector piloting sleeve and is configured to receive a generally annular<br>
combustion seal subject to combustion gas pressures within the combustion chamber.<br>
The generally annular combustion seal is biased against the generally tapering portion<br>
of the annular groove when the generally annular combustion seal is subject to<br>
combustion gas pressures. Furthermore, the generally annular combustion seal is<br>
biased radially inward to sealingly engage the injector tip portion when the generally<br>
annular combustion seal is biased against the generally tapering portion of the annular<br>
groove.<br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

[0011]	Figure 5 is a magnified view of a portion of the cylinder head assembly of<br>
Figure 4.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
portion of a cylinder head assembly 10 for a direct injection internal combustion engine,<br>
not shown. The cylinder head assembly 10 includes a cylinder head 12 formed from a<br>
cast metal such as aluminum, iron, magnesium, etc. having a fuel injector assembly 14<br>
mounted thereto. The cylinder head 12 defines an injector bore 16 and partially defines a<br>
combustion chamber 18. The injector bore 16 is in communication with the combustion<br>
chamber 18. The fuel injector assembly 14 includes an injector body 20 having an<br>
injector tip portion 22 extending therefrom. The injector bore 16 is configured to receive<br>
the injector tip portion 22 such that the injector tip portion 22 is in communication with<br>
the combustion chamber 18.<br>
[0013]	A fuel rail 24 is mounted with respect to the fuel injector assembly 14 and<br>
is operable to provide a source of pressurized fuel 26 to the fuel injector assembly 14.<br>
The fuel injector assembly 14 is operable to communicate metered and timed amounts of<br>
pressurized fuel 26 from the fuel rail 24 directly into the combustion chamber 18 for<br>
subsequent combustion therein. As such, the fuel injector assembly 14 may be<br>
characterized as a direct injection fuel injector. An isolator member 28 is disposed<br>
between the cylinder head 12 and the fuel injector assembly 14 and is operable to provide<br>
a measure of compliance such that hard contact or grounding between the fuel injector<br>
assembly 14 and the cylinder head 12 is prevented. In so doing, the transmission of noise<br><br>
4<br>
producing vibrations between the fuel injector assembly 14 and the cylinder head 12 is<br>
reduced. A secondary seal 29 is operable to seal the injector body 20 with respect to the<br>
cylinder head 12.<br>
[0014]	The injector bore includes first and second generally cylindrical portions<br>
30 and 32, respectively, having a generally tapering bore portion 34 therebetween. The<br>
generally tapering bore portion 34 is operable to guide or pilot the injector tip portion 22<br>
into the second generally cylindrical portion 32 during insertion of the fuel injector<br>
assembly 14. Since the fuel injector assembly 14 is in direct communication with the<br>
combustion chamber 18, the fuel injector assembly 14 is subject to high pressure loads<br>
and temperatures of the combustion process. Therefore, the fuel injector assembly 14<br>
must be sealed with respect to the cylinder head 12. The injector tip portion 22 defines<br>
an annular groove 36 configured to receive a portion of a combustion seal 38. The<br>
annular groove 36 includes a generally tapering portion 37 operable to radially expand<br>
the combustion seal 38 as the combustion seal 38 is biased thereon by combustion gases,<br>
indicated by arrows 39, within the combustion chamber 18. The combustion seal 38 is<br>
generally annular and sleeve-like in shape and is operable to sealingly engage the second<br>
generally cylindrical portion 32 of the injector bore 16 thereby preventing combustion<br>
gases 39 from traversing the injector bore 16 during operation of the internal combustion<br>
engine. The combustion seal 38 is preferably formed from glass or carbon filled<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene; however, other materials may be employed possessing the<br>
requisite temperature and chemical resistance while remaining within the scope of that<br>
which is claimed.<br>
[0015]	Referring to Figure 2 and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is<br>
shown a portion of the cylinder head assembly 10 enlarged to illustrate further aspects<br>
of the present embodiment. In operation, the combustion seal 38 is subject to pressure<br>
forces exerted thereon by the combustion gases 39. As a result, the combustion seal 38<br>
is biased upward, as viewed in Figure 2, against the generally tapering portion 37 of<br>
the annular groove 36. As the combustion seal 38 is biased against the generally<br>
tapering portion 37, the generally tapering portion 37 expands the combustion seal 38<br>
radially outward to sealingly engage the second generally cylindrical portion 32 of the<br><br>
5<br>
injector bore 16. As such, the combustion seal 38 may be characterized as an<br>
"energized" combustion seal. That is, the combustion seal 38 is energized by the<br>
pressure forces of the combustion gases 39 to effect sealing of the injector tip portion<br>
22 with respect to the injector bore 16. Therefore, the sealing effectiveness of the<br>
combustion seal 38 is proportional to the pressure forces acting on the combustion seal<br>
by the combustion gases 39. The generally tapering portion 37 of the annular groove<br>
36 has a taper angle 0, shown in Figure 2. In the preferred embodiment the taper angle<br>
0 is approximately 12 to approximately 20 degrees. This range of taper angles will<br>
enable ease of insertion of the injector tip portion 22 within the injector bore 16 during<br>
assembly, while maintaining adequate scaling effectiveness of the combustion seal over a<br>
range of friction coefficients for the injector bore 16, injector tip portion 22, and the<br>
combustion seal 38.<br>
[0016]	In operation, the fuel injector assembly 14 will exhibit small axial<br>
movements, as illustrated by arrow 44, as a result of variations in pressure within the<br>
combustion chamber 18 and the pressurized fuel 26 within the fuel rail. The isolation<br>
member 28 may tend to increase the magnitude of this movement. Since the<br>
combustion seal 38 is energized by pressure forces exerted by the combustion gases 39,<br>
the combustion seal 38 is operable to maintain a seal between the injector tip portion 22<br>
and the second generally cylindrical portion 32 of the injector bore 16 during axial<br>
movement of the fuel injector assembly 14.<br>
[0017]	Referring to Figure 3a and with continued reference to Figures 1 and 2,<br>
there is shown the combustion seal 38 in an un-deformed state, i.e. prior to installation<br>
within the generally annular groove 36. As shown, the combustion seal 38 has a bore<br>
40 that extends the length of the combustion seal 38. The bore 40 is shown in Figure<br>
3a as generally cylindrical; however, the bore 40 may have a generally tapering shape<br>
to complement the taper angle 0 of the generally tapering portion 37. Referring to figure<br>
3b and with continued reference to Figures 1 and 2, an alternate embodiment of the<br>
combustion seal 38 is indicated at 38A. The combustion seal 38A defines a bore 42 that<br>
extends the length of the combustion seal 38A. The bore 42 includes first and second<br><br>
6<br>
tapering portions 45 and 46, respectively, extending from the midline or center of the<br>
combustion seal 38A and tapering outward. The first and second tapering portions 45<br>
and 46 have a taper configured to generally complement the taper angle 0 of the<br>
generally tapering portion 37. The first and second tapering portions 45 and 46 provide a<br>
measure of error-proofing for assembly purposes since the orientation of the combustion<br>
seal 38A as the combustion seal 38A is inserted into the generally annular groove 36 is<br>
irrelevant.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown an alternate embodiment of the<br>
cylinder head assembly 10 of Figure 1, generally indicated at 10A. The cylinder head<br>
assembly 10A includes a fuel injector assembly 14A. The fuel injector assembly 14A<br>
includes the injector body 20 having an injector tip portion 22A extending therefrom.<br>
The annular groove 36 defined by injector tip portion 22 of Figure 1 is lacking in the<br>
injector tip portion 22A of Figure 4. An injector piloting sleeve 48 is mounted with<br>
respect to the cylinder head 12 and defines the generally tapering bore portion 34 and<br>
the generally cylindrical bore portion 32 of the injector bore 16. The injector piloting<br>
sleeve 48 may be retained within the cylinder head 12 by interference fit, threaded<br>
engagement, or other fastening means. The injector piloting sleeve 48 defines an<br>
annular groove 50 configured to receive a portion of the combustion seal 38. The<br>
annular groove 50 may be formed by a machining operation. The injector piloting<br>
sleeve 48 may be formed by a powdered metal process.<br>
[0019]	The combustion seal 38 sealingly engages the injector tip portion 22A of<br>
the fuel injector assembly 14A. The annular groove 50 is preferably formed in the<br>
second generally cylindrical bore portion 32. The annular groove 50 includes a<br>
generally tapering portion 52 operable to radially compress the combustion seal 38 as the<br>
combustion seal 38 is biased thereon by combustion gases 39 within the combustion<br>
chamber 18. The combustion seal 38 is operable to sealingly engage the second injector<br>
tip portion 22A of the fuel injector assembly 14A thereby preventing combustion gases<br>
39 from traversing the injector bore 16 during operation of the engine.<br><br>
7<br>
[0020]	Referring to Figure 5 and with continued reference to Figure 4, there is<br>
shown a portion of the cylinder head assembly 10A enlarged to illustrate further aspects<br>
of the present embodiment. In operation, the combustion seal 38 is subject to pressure<br>
forces exerted thereon by the combustion gases 39. As a result, the combustion seal 38<br>
is biased upward, as viewed in Figure 5, against the generally tapering portion 52 of<br>
the annular groove 50. As the combustion seal 38 is biased against the generally<br>
tapering portion 52, the generally tapering portion 52 biases or urges the combustion<br>
seal 38 radially inward to sealingly engage the injector tip portion 22A of the fuel<br>
injector assembly 14A. The combustion seal 38 is energized by the pressure forces of<br>
the combustion gases 39 to effect sealing of the injector tip portion 22A with respect to<br>
the injector bore 16. Therefore the sealing effectiveness of the combustion seal 38 is<br>
proportional to the pressure forces acting on the combustion seal by the combustion<br>
gases 39. The generally tapering portion 52 of the annular groove 50 has a taper angle<br>
0, shown in Figure 5. In the preferred embodiment the taper angle O is approximately<br>
10 to approximately 20 degrees. This range of taper angles will enable ease of insertion<br>
and removal of the injector tip portion 22A within the injector bore 16, while maintaining<br>
adequate sealing effectiveness of the combustion seal 38 over a range of friction<br>
coefficients for the injector bore 16, injector tip portion 22A, and the combustion seal 38.<br>
[0021]	As described hereinabove, the fuel injector assembly 14A will exhibit<br>
small axial movements, as illustrated by arrow 44, as a result of variations in pressure<br>
within the combustion chamber 18 and the pressurized fuel 26 within the fuel rail. The<br>
isolation member 28 may tend to increase the magnitude of this movement. Since the<br>
combustion seal 38 is energized by pressure forces exerted by the combustion gases 39,<br>
the combustion seal 38 is operable to maintain a seal between the injector tip portion<br>
22A and the injector bore 16 during the axial movement of the fuel injector assembly<br>
14A.<br>
[0022]	Additionally, the injector piloting sleeve 48 may be formed from a<br>
material having a similar coefficient of thermal expansion as that of the injector tip<br>
portion 22A. In this case, close tolerances may be maintained between the second<br><br>
8<br>
generally cylindrical bore portion 32 and the injector tip portion 22A over a wide range<br>
of temperatures. Furthermore, the injector piloting sleeve 48 may be formed without<br>
the annular groove 50 for use with the fuel injector assembly 14 of Figure 1.<br>
[0023]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
