Method for producing pharmaceuticals or food supplements comprising pigmented polymer coatings<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing pharmaceuticals or food supplements comprising pigmented polymer coatings.<br>
Prior art<br>
Abletshauser C.B., describes in "Film coating of pellets with insoluble polymers obtained in situ crossiinking in fluidized bed" in Journal of Controlled Release 27 (1993), pp. 149-156, a method in which a film-forming polymer, sodium alginate, in aqueous solution and a crosslinker, e.g. a CaCl2 solution or a (meth)acrylate copolymer with tertiary amino group radicals (EUDRAGIT® E), are sprayed simultaneously from two separate spray nozzles onto active ingredient-containing pellets. The film application can take place for example in a fluidized bed apparatus with two spray nozzles installed therein. The method has an approximately equivalent result to sequential application of the two components, but has the advantage of saving time.<br>
WO 00/05307 describes a method for producing a coating agent and binder for oral or dermal pharmaceuticals consisting of (a) 35 - 98% by weight of a copolymer consisting of free-radical polymerized CI to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary ammonium groups, and (b) 1 - 50% by weight of a plasticizer, and 1 - 15% by weight of an emulsif ier with an HLB of at least 14, where components (a) , (b) and (c) are mixed together with or without addition of water and, v/here appropriate, with addition of an active   pharmaceutical    ingredient   and   further<br><br>
binder is produced by melting, casting, spreading or spraying, where the copolymer (a) is introduced in powder form with an average  particle size of 1 - 40 fim.<br>
Additives which can be incorporated are pigments. Ordinarily, aluminum or iron oxide pigments are dispersed. The usual amounts of pigments employed are between 23 and 60% by weight based on the polymer mixture. However, because of the high pigment-binding capacity, amounts of up to 100% by weight can also be processed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the addition of pigments takes . place in concentrated form as final layer. Application takes place by spraying as powder or from aqueous suspension with a solids content of 5 - 30%. The amount required is lower than on incorporation into the polymer layer and is 0.1 - 2% based on the weight of the pharmaceutical.<br>
Problem and solution<br>
WO 00/053C7 describes a method for producing a coating agent and binder for oral or dermal pharmaceuticals. Further conventional additives can be added, and the coating agent and binder can be produced by melting, casting, spreading or spraying.<br>
Additives which can are mentioned are inter alia pigments. These can usually be incorporated well using known methodologies. However, it has emerged that in practice problems may arise in spray application on incorporation of pigments which are incompatible with the coating agent. In particular, only a short time after the addition of pigment there may be partial coagulation of the dispersion. As a consequence, the spray nozzles are blocked and the application method<br><br>
Since pigments are frequently employed in coating agents, the object was regarded as being to develop the method described in WO 00/05307 further so that spray application is possible reliably and efficiently even with use of pigments as additives.<br>
The object is achieved by a<br>
method  for  producing  pharmaceuticals  or  parts  of<br>
pharmaceuticals or food supplements or parts thereof,<br>
by coating substrates with a film-forming coating agent comprising a pigment,<br>
where the film-forming coating agent is a (meth)aerylate copolymer having cationic or anionic groups,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the film-forming coating agent and the pigment are initially present separate from one another as   liquid, sprayable, incompatible individual portions in the form of a solution, suspension or dispersion, and<br>
are sprayed simultaneously by spray application by means of one or more spray devices which are capable of separate spraying of liquids, singly or together, and their spray beams overlap,<br>
in such a way that the incompatible individual portions are mixed during the spraying process, impinge on the substrate and form thereon, after evaporation of the liquid, a uniformly pigmented film coating, resulting in the pharmaceutical or the food supplement or the part thereof.<br><br>
The invention relates to a<br>
method for producing pharmaceuticals or parts of pharmaceuticals or food supplements or parts thereof,<br>
by coating substrates with a film-forming coating agen* comprising a pigment,<br>
where the film-forming coating agent is a (meth)acrylate copolymer having cationic or anionic groups,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the film-forming coating agent and the pigment are initially present separate from one another as liquid, sprayable, incompatible individual portions in the form of a solution, suspension or dispersion, and<br>
are sprayed simultaneously by spray application by means of one or more spray devices which are capable of separate spraying of liquids, singly or together, and their spray beams overlap,<br>
in such a way that the incompatible individual portions are mixed during the spraying process, impinge on the substrate and form thereon, after evaporation of the liquid, a uniformly pigmented film coating, resulting in the pharmaceutical or the food supplement or the part thereof.<br>
The film-forming coating agent<br>
The film-forming coating agent is a (meth)acrylate copolymer having cationic or anionic groups.<br>
The film-forming coating agent is i;.i~.„^-.ly ;::•-■;■-.■ r.  <br>
separate from the pigment, as liquid, sprayable, incompatible individual portions, preferably in the form of a solution or dispersion.<br>
The film-forming coating agent is a dispersion, e.g. with a solids content of from 10 to 60, preferably 15 to 40, % by weight, comprising a (meth) acrylate copolymer. The dispersion represents a sprayable individual portion which preferably comprises no pigment. Besides the (meth)acrylate copolymer it is possible for" pharmaceutically usual excipients such as, for example, plasticizers to be present.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled worker that the dispersion may comprise a small proportion of the total amount of pigment to be processed, without an adverse effect on the method of the invention necessarily being associated therewith. This applies in particular when the amount is so small that no incompatibilities occur. Addition of a small, e.g. also soluble, amount of pigment, e.g. less than 0.1-10% by weight based on the polymer, may be worthwhile in individual cases for color identification of the dispersion.<br>
The (meth)acrylate copolymer preferably present in the dispersion is composed of 30 to 80% by weight of free-radical polymerized Cx- to C^-alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and 70 to 20% by weight of (meth)acrylate monomers having a tertiary amino group in the alkyl radical.<br>
Suitable monomers with functional tertiary amine groups are listed in US 4 705 695, column 3, line 64 to column 4, line 13. Particular mention should be made of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, 2-dimethylaminopropyl acrylate, dimethylaminopropyl methacrylate, dimethylaminobenzyl acrylate, dimethylaminobenzyl methacrylate,      (3-dimethylamino-2, 2-dimethyi) pro;".-:<br><br>
acrylate,	dimethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl<br>
methacrylate, (3-diethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl acrylate     and     diethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl<br>
methacrylate. Dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
The content of monomers with tertiary ammonium groups in whe copolymer can advantageously be between 20 and 70% by weight, preferably between 40 and 60% by weight. The proportion of Ci- to C4-alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid is 70-30% by weight. Mention should be made of methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate and butyl acrvlate.<br>
A suitable (meth)acrylate copolymer with tertiary amino groups may be composed for example of 20-30% by weight of methyl methacrylate, 20-30% by weight of butyl methacrylate and 60-40% by weight of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate.<br>
A specifically suitable commercially available (meth)acrylate copolymer with tertiary amino groups is composed for example of 2 5% by weight of methyl methacrylate, 25% by weight of butyl methacrylate and 50% by weight of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (EUDRAGIT® E100, EUDRAGIT® E PO).<br>
The copolymers can . be obtained in a manner known per se by free-radical bulk, solution, bead or emulsion polymerization. They may before processing be brought to a suitable particle size range by suitable grinding, drying or spraying processes.<br>
Suitable apparatuses for producing powders are familiar to the skilled worker, e.g. air jet mills, pinned disk mills, compartment mills. It is possible where appropriate to incl1.. ' ■.-.     ~z. .. . . r ..'. . '.-   . ....'     . . -__ ..<br><br>
suitable mill for industrial large quantities is, for example, an opposed jet mill (Multi No. 4200) which is operated with a gage pressure of about 6 bar.<br>
The average particle size of the powders can be determined as follows:<br>
By air jet sieving to divide up the ground produce easily into a few fractions. This method is somewhat less exact than the alternatives in this range of measurement.<br>
A further very suitable measurement method is laser diffraction .to determine the particle size distribution. Commercially available apparatuses permit measurement in air (Malvern S3.01 particle sizer) or preferably in liquid media (LOT, Galai CIS 1) . A precondition for measurement in liquids is that the polymer does not dissolve therein or the particles change in another way during the measurement. A suitable medium "is, for example, a highly dilute (approx. 0.02% strength) aqueous polysorbate 8 0 solution.<br>
At least 70, preferably 90, % of the particles based on the mass (mass distribution) can preferably be in the 1 - 40 jam size range.<br>
The average particle diameter must be in the range between 1 and 40, preferably between 5 and 35, in particular between 10 and 20 |im.<br>
The  problem  of  incompatibility  also  exisrs  with (meth)acrylate  copolymers   having  anionicm   'groups, especially those with comparatively high contents of methacrylic acid residues.<br><br>
The ■(meth)acrylate copolymer may consist for example also of 40 to 60% by weight methacrylic acid and 60 to 40% by weight methyl methacrylate or 60 to 40% by weight ethyl acrylate and preferably be in the form of a dispersion (EUDRAGIT© L30D-55 type).<br>
Substrates<br>
The substrates for pharmaceutical applications may be for example active ingredient crystals, active ingredient-containing cores, granules, tablets, pellets or capsules. These may be of regular or irregular shape.<br>
The size of granules, pellets or crystals is between<br>
0.01 and 2.5 mm, that of tablets is between 2.5 and 30.0 mm. Capsules consist for example of gelatin, starch or cellulose derivatives.<br>
The substrates may comprise a biologically active substance (active ingredient) up to 95% and further pharmaceutical excipients up to 99.9% by weight.<br>
Usual production processes are direct compression, compression of dry, moist or sintered granules, extrusion and subsequent rounding off, wet or dry granulation or direct pelleting (e.g. on plates) or by binding of powders (powder layering) onto active ingredient-free beads (nonpareilles) or active ingredient-containing particles.<br>
Besides the active ingredient, further pharmaceutical excipients may be present, such as, for example, binders ^such as cellulose and derivatives thereof, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), humectants, disintegration promoters, lubricants, disintegrants, (meth)aerylates, starch and derivatives thereof, sugar solubilizers or others.<br><br>
The substrates usually comprise active pharmaceutical ingredients or food supplements such as, for example, ascorbic acid.<br>

The active ingredients can if desired also be used in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives, and in the case cf chiral active ingredients it is possible to employ both optically active isomers and racemates or mixtures of diastereoisomers. If desired, the compositions of the invention may also comprise owe or more active pharmaceutical ingredients.<br>
Pigments<br>
Pigments incompatible with the coaring agent are in particular those pigments which, if added directly to the (meth)acrylate copolymer; . dispersion, e.g. by stirring in, in the amounts normally used of, for example, 20 to 400% by weight based on the dry weight of the (meth)acrylate copolymer, lead to destabilization of the dispersion, coagulation, to signs of inhomogeneity or similarly unwanted effeces. The pigments to be used are additionally of course nontoxic and suitable for pharmaceutical purposes and/or for use in food supplements.<br>
Pigments incompatible with the coating agent may be for example alumina pigments. Incompatible pigments are in particular orange yellow S (El10, C.I. 15 98 5, FD&amp;C Yellow 6), indigo carmine (E132, C.I. 73015, FD*C Blue 2), tartrazine (E 102, C.I. 19140, FD*C Yellow 5), Ponceau 4R (E 125, C.I. 16255, FD&amp;C Cochineal Red A), quinoline yellow (E 104, C.I. 47005, FD&amp;C Yellow 10) , erythrosine (E127, C.I. 4 54 30, FD&amp;C Red 3) , azcrubine (E 122, C.I. 14720, FD&amp;C Carmoisine) , amaranth (E 123, C.I. 16185, FD&amp;C Red 2), acid brilliant green (E 142, C.I. 44090, FD&amp;C Green S) .<br>
The pigment is in the form of a sprayable individual portion, in particular separate from (meth)acrylate copolymer.  It  is  preferred  for  no  (meth)acrylate<br><br>
copolymer to be present. The pigment is preferably suspended alone or together with the release agent in water, e.g. in a concentration of from 5 to 4 0% by weight, preferably 10 to 30% by weight, based on the total amount. The pigment suspension may additionally comprise pharmaceutical^ usual excipients such as, for example, plasticizers or dispersion aids, e.g. Mg stearate, talc or precipitated silica (Syloid). It is also possible in principle for the pigment to be dispersed in an organic solvent, e.g. ethanol, acetone or isopropanol. Further excipients may also be present in this case.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled worker that the sprayable individual portion comprising the pigment may comprise a small proportion, e.g. 0.1-10% by weight, of the total (meth)acrylate copolymer to be used, without an adverse effect on the method of the invention necessarily being associated therewith.<br>
Spray"'device<br>
It is possible to employ or use as spray device those having two or more two-fluid nozzles or one or more three-fluid nozzles.<br>
In a two-fluid nozzle or a three-fluid nozzle, in each case one of the nozzle orifices is supplied with compressed air to atomize the liquid which is sprayed at the same time. The other or the two other spray nozzles serve to eject the respective film-forming coating agent. To carry out the method, therefore, either at least two two-fluid nozzles are required, where one in each case sprays the first film-forming coating agent and the liquid with the further substance, or a three-fluid nozzle, which sprays both simultaneously, is required.<br><br>
The delivery rates of the sprayed liquids can be influenced independently of one another by the setting of parameters such as, for example, the pump outputs or the spraying pressure and/or the air delivery rates. It is possible in principle for the settings of the spray devices to be carried out manually during the spraying process. In order to obtain reproducible results, it is preferred to control the parameters which influence the delivery rates of the sprayed liquids by means of fixed programs, e.g. by electronic means.<br>
Examples of commercially available spray devices are, for example, the Pilot SIL XII spray gun (double two-fluid nozzle; manufactured by Walther, Wuppertal, Germany), the "Concentric Dual-Feed Nozzle" model (three-fluid nozzle, manufactured by ShinEtsu, Japan) or model 946-S15 (three-fluid nozzle, manufactured by Dusen Schlick GmbH, D-96253 Untersiemau, Germany) .<br>
Spray application<br>
Spray application takes place by means of one or more spray devices which have, singly or together, at least two separate nozzles for liquids and whose spray beams overlap.<br>
The film-forming coating agent and the pigment are initially present separate from one another as sprayable individual portions and are sprayed simultaneously in such as way that the incompatible individual portions are mixed during the spraying, impinge on the substrate and form thereon, after evaporation of the contained liquid, a uniformly "pigmented film coating.<br>
The air pressure generating the spray mist is between 0.5 and 3 bar, preferably between 1 and 2 bar. Only in the rare cases where the viscosity of one or bo~h spray<br><br>
liquids is distinctly higher than water may it be necessary to increase the spraying pressure further.<br>
The spraying rate of the two individual components may vary and depends greatly on the batch size, the individual formula and the drying capacity, determined by the air throughput, of the equipment used. Ordinarily, the total of the spraying rates of the two liquids is from 1 to 15 g/kg of cores x min, preferably from 5 to 10 g/kg of cores x min).<br>
The product temperature to be maintained during the spraying depends on the formula of the individual components used and th.e properties, determined thereby, of the film former. Guideline values are from 15 to 50°C, preferably 20 to 40°C&gt; particularly preferably 25 to 35°C.<br>
Details of the methods, equipment etc. can be found in familiar textbooks, e.g. :<br>
Voigt, R. (1984): Lehrbuch der pharmazeutischen Technologie; Verlag Chemie Weinheim - Beerfield Beach/Florida - Basel.<br>
-	Sucker, H., Fuchs, P. , Speiser, P. : Pharmazeutische Technologie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart (1991), in particular chapters 15 and 16, pp. 626-642.<br>
-	Gennaro, A. , R. (editor), Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton Pennsylvania (1985), chapter 88, pp. 1567-1573.<br>
-	List, P.H. (1982): Arzneiformenlehre, Wissenschaft-liche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Stuttgart.<br>
The film formation takes place through drying preferably during the spray application. The necessary energy input for evaporation of the water can take<br><br>
place through the heated process air, microwaves or other radiation, where appropriate also in vacuo.<br>
The spray application can take place for example in a drum coater, a coating pan, a fluidized bed apparatus or a spray sifter.<br>
The spray application can take place using r.anually guided spray devices. However, better and more reproducible results are usually obtained with spray devices which are fixed installations, so tha~ these are preferred.<br>
Equipment<br>
The method is particularly preferably carried cut with drum coaters, coating pans, fluidized bed apparatuses or spray sifters comprising as spray device one or more three-fluid nozzles, in particular as fixed installation.<br>
Pigmented pharmaceutical or food supplement cr parts thereof<br>
Pigmented pharmaceuticals or food supplements cr parts thereof can be produced or obtained by means of the method of the invention.<br>
In this connection, during the spray application the pigments are entrapped in fractions of seconds in the polymer matrix which results directly through the virtually simultaneous proceeding evaporation of the water. The sprayed individual portions are mixed together in fractions of seconds during the spray application and form, through the virtually simultaneous proceeding evaporation of the water or solvent,  a polymer matrix  on  zhe  surface  of  the<br><br>
substrates. The resulting molecular matrix structure is therefore novel.<br>
Excipients customary in pharmacy<br>
Plasticizers: Substances suitable as plasticizers ordinarily have a molecular weight between 100 and 20 000 and contain one or more hydrophilic groups in the molecule, e.g. hydroxyl, ester or amino groups. Citrates, phthalates, sebacates, castor oil are suitable. Examples of suitable plasticizers are alkyl citrates, propylene glycol, glycerol esters, alkyl phthalates, alkyl sebacates, sucrose esters, sorbitan esters, diethyl sebacate, dibutyl sebacate, fatty acids and esters thereof and polyethylene glycols 4000 to 20 000. Preferred plasticizers are tributyl citrate, triethyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, dibutyl sebacate and diethyl sebacate. The amounts used are between 1 and 35, preferably 2 to 10, % by weight based on the (meth)acrylate copolymer.<br>
Dryers (non-stick agents): Dryers have the fallowing properties: they have large specific surface areas, are chemically inert, are free-flowing and comprise fine particles. Because of these properties, they can advantageously be dispersed homogeneously in melts and reduce the tack of polymers containing highly polar comonomers as functional groups.<br>
Examples of dryers are:<br>
Alumina,   magnesium  oxide,   kaolin,   talc,   silica (Aerosils), barium sulfate, carbon black and cellulose.<br>
Release agents (mold release agents)<br>
Examples of release agents are:<br>
esters of fatty acids or fatty amides, aliphatic, long-chain  carboxylic  acids,  fatty  alcohols  and  esters<br><br>
thereof, montan waxes or paraffin waxes and metal soaps; particular mention should be made of glycerol monostearate, stearyl alcohol, glycerol behenic acid ester, cetyl alcohol, palmitic acid, stearic acid, canauba wax, beeswax etc.<br>
Further excipients: Mention should be made here of, for example, stabilizers, colorants, antioxidants, wetting agents, pigments, gloss agents etc. They are used in particular as processing aids and are intended can be to ensure a reliable and reproducible production process and good long-term storage stability. Further excipients customary in pharmacy may be present in amounts of, from 0.001% by weight to 30% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the copolymer.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EUDRAGIT® E PO is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate in the ratio 25:25:50 with an average particle size of 15 pm.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A mixture of a spray suspension of a EUDRAGIT® E dispersion formed from 57.0 g of EUDRAGIT® E PO, 4.0 g of sodium lauryl sulfate, 8.55 g of dibutyl sebacate and 278.5 g of water coagulates shortly after stirring in a pigment suspension consisting of 57.0 g of talc, 17.0 g of aluminum pigment orange yellow, 34.0 g of titanium dioxide and 432.0 g of water. Spray application of the mixture is impossible because the spray nozzle becomes blocked.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A film-forming dispersion is produced from 57.0 g of EUDRAGIT® E PO, 4.0 g of sodium lauryl sulfate, 8.55 g of dibutyl sebacate and 278.5 g of water by stirring at room temperature. (Polymer dispersion).<br>
A fine-particle suspension is produced from 57.0 g of talc, 17.0 g of aluminum pigment orange yellow, 34.0 g of titanium dioxide and 432.0 g of water at room temperature using a homogenizer (Ultra Turrax) (pigment suspension) .<br>
The two liquids are fed by tubing pumps to the nozzle heads of a dual multi-fluid nozzle, e.g. Walt her Pilot SIL XII, and atomized so that the mists of the EUDRAGIT® E dispersion and of the pigment suspension are mixed immediately after the nozzle outlet. The coating process is carried out on 3 kg of placebo tablets (diameter' 10 mm) in a conventional coaring pan<br><br>
(35 cm diameter) while feeding in hot air. The tablet bed temperature is kept at about 30 °C. The spraying pressure of both heads was adjusted to about 1 bar. The spraying process lasted about 60 min.<br>
Subsequent drying for 15 minutes results in smooth, glossy pigmented films.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A mixture of a spray suspension of a EUDRAGIT® E dispersion formed from 114.0 g of EUDRAGIT® E PO, 8.0 g of sodium lauryl sulfate, 17.1 g of dibutyl sebacate and 556.9 g of water coagulates shortly after stirring in a pigment suspension consisting of 34.2 g of magnesium stearate, 17.1 g of cochineal red lake, 28.5 g of titanium dioxide and 319.2 g of water. Spray application of the mixture is impossible because the spray nozzle becomes blocked..<br>

A film-forming dispersion is produced from 114.0 g of<br>
EUDRAGIT® E PO, 8.0 g of sodium lauryl sulfate, 17/l g<br>
of dibutyl sebacate and 556.9 g of water by stirring at<br>
room temperature. (Polymer dispersion).<br>
A fine-particle suspension is produced from 24.2 g of<br>
magnesium  stearate,  17.1 g  of  cochineal  red  lake,<br>
28.5 g of titanium dioxide and 319.2 g of water at room<br>
temperature using a homogenizer (Ultra Turrax) (pigment<br>
suspension).<br>
The two liquids are fed by tubing pumps to the nozzle heads of a dual multi -fluid nozzle, e.g. Walt her Pilot SIL XII, and atomized so that the mists of the EUDRAGIT® E dispersion and of the pigment suspension are mixed individually after the nozzle outlet. The coating process is carried out on 3 kg of placebo tablets (diameter 10 mm) in a conventional coating pan (35 cm diameter) while feeding in hot air. The tablet bed tempera .ure is kept at about 30 °C. The sprayir.:_<br><br>
.pressure of both heads was adjusted to about 1 bar. The spraying process lasted about 74 min.<br>
Subsequent drying for 15 minutes results in smooth, glossy pigmented films.<br><br><br><br><br>
