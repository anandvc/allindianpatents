				<td>"IMPROVEMENT OF ROTARY TYPE WAGON TIPPLER FOR W O.ADING BULK MATERIAL FROM OPEN TYPE BOX WAGONS"<br>
Use: Rotary Wagon Tippler is used for mechanized unloading of bulk material from open type box-wagons, at a specific point.<br>
Wagon Tipplers are of two types such as,<br>
1.	Rotary type; where, wagon enters in to a cylindrical cage, which is rotated to about 150 degrees, to discharge material in the hopper.<br>
2.	Rota-side type; where the wagon with the platform is mechanically raised to a ceitain height and Ihen it is tilted to discharge material in the hopper.<br>
For tippling, both the types depend on Motor power of about 100 kW for an 8-wheeler Box wagon.<br>
Description of a Rotary Wagon Tippler.<br>
A Rotary Wagon Tippler (Isometric views: Figure-4 &amp; 5 and End views: Fig. ! &amp; 3) consists of,<br>
1.	A fabncated cylindrical cage Fig-4, 5,comprising two circular discs "a" connected<br>
with fabricated frame 'm" alor^ with a slide able Platform "b" and rails "c" (fig. 1,3)<br>
on which the wagon    "W" rests. The top of the fabncated frame "m" is free from<br>
structural, to facilitate free flow of materials from the wagon while tippling,<br>
ii	4 nos. Roller Bearing Blocks "d" on which the two circular plates of the cylindrical<br>
cage is supported. The cage rotates on the Roller blocks during operation; asis of<br>
rotation is the center of the discs "a", iii.        Hydraulic locking arrangement "e" (Fig-1, 3) is provided from top on the WagOn, so<br>
that the wagon is locked and can't move, and also si4&gt;ports the wagon during tippling<br>
operation,<br>
iv.	A sliding arrangement "f (Fig-l, 3) of the rails together with platform unit "b", is<br>
provided to enable the wagon to slide to rest on one side, against a wooden buffet wall<br>
"g" (Fig-1, 3), when the tippler rotates,<br>
v.	A motor drives system "h" (Fig-1, 3, 4, 5) using Motoi- gear and elecfromagnetic<br>
brake, vi.        Hopper "i" lot receiving disciiarged material.<br>
The wagon to be unloaded is pushed in the Cylindrical Steel Cage (Fig-l, 4). The Wagon is locked by, energizir^ multiple Hydraulic-locks at top, "e". When the dnve motor "h" is energized, the cylindrical cage along widi the wagon starts rotating on the 4 numbers roller blocks "d" in the direction of arrow as shown in Fig-1, 3. While rotating, the Platfoim-slidmg arrangement "T (Fig-1, 3) along with wagon 'W' slides about 50 mm, to rest the wagon on the wooden buffer wall "g" (Fig-1,3). Thus during the Tippler's rotation, the platform with the wagon is locked between rails, wooden buffer wall as well as by hydraulic plungers from the top.<br>
As this process of rotation cc?itinues, the material starts flowing out from the wagon, when the Tippler has turned beyond 45 degrees. The tippling is completed from this portion to 170 degrees rotation, when the Tippler stops. In automatic operation, the tippler starts to return to its initial position after a pame of 5 seconds.<br>
After the Tippler's coming back to the position of 14 degree with honzonlal, the hydraulic plunger on the top of the wagon disengages, and the p1;itform with the wagon comes back to initial position with the assistance of the spring pull.<br><br>
When the Tippler has come back to the original position, the einptj' wagon is pushed out by the incoming loaded wagon for next tippling. In the existing tipplers, the weight below the rotating axis is high, hence a high-power motor of over] 0(1 kW is required to overcome the load resistance of the loaded wagon and to rotate the cylindrical cage of the tippler.<br>
Every existing Tippler need about 100 kW motor power for tippling, because,<br>
i.   With Rotary Tipplers, the load is below the rotating axis. Therefore effort<br>
13 required to overcome the load resistance, ii.   While with Rota-side Tipplers, the entire load including the wagon has to be physically lifted and rotated. This needs motor power.<br>
Present Invention.<br>
In this invention, ii is so arranged that the load is above the rotating axis of the tippler, as such, the load in the wagon applies effort on the cylindrical cage to rotate. As a result the loaded wagon now acts as prime mover to the motor to act as a generator. During return cycle of the cylindrical cage, the motor again acts as motor. Hence in this presentation, the term "motor/generator" has been used<br>
For simplicity, consider a rod (Fig-2), whose CG is at 'x'. With rotating axis at "x' the system is balanced, i.e. practically no force is required to rotate the system.<br>
If a weight is added above the point 'x' say, at 'y', the top becomes heavy and makes the system unstable to tum/tipple, requirii^ no force at all, rather generates force proportional to effort. Such "force" can be used to our advantage.<br>
Instead of adding weight at 'y', if the weight is placed below the axis point "x", say at 'z\ the bottom becomes heavy. Effort will he required to rotate the system in this position.<br>
In this unbalanced position if weight is gradually added say at "y". a fiTne will come when, no effort will be required, signifying that the system is balanced. Further addition of weight at "y" will again unbalance the arrangement to tipple.<br>
In this invention, the Wagon Tippler consists of the following components,<br>
A Rotary Wagon Tippler (Isometric views: Figure- 5 and End views: Fig. 3) consists of,<br>
i, Fabncated cylmdncal cage Fig-5, comprising two cucular discs "a" connected with fabricated frame "m" along with a shdeable Platform "b" and rails "c" (fig, 3 &amp; 5) on which the wagon "W" rests. The top of the fabricated frame "m" is free from structural, to facilitate free flow of materials from the wagon while tippling. Counterweights "k" (Fig, 3 &amp;5) have been added (by usii^ steel plates or any other material of size), on the upper potion of the two circular discs, both inside and out side, as shown in shaded portion of the discs (fig-3, 5). Hxtra counterweights, if required, the upper structural members of steel cage "m" (Fig- 3 &amp; 5) may be made heavier. The counterweights shall be added to make the system almost balanced, with an empty wagon inside the cylindrical cage.<br>
ii, 4 nos. Roller Beanr^ Blocks "d" on which the two circular plates of the cylindrical cage is supported. The cage rotates on the Roller blocks dunng operation; axis of rotation is the center of the discs "a",<br>
iii. Electrically operated hydraulic plunger locking arrangement "e" (Fig-3) is provided from top on the wagon so that the wagon is locked from the top and can't move. This also supports the wagon during tippling operation<br><br>
iv. A sliding arrangement "f (Fig-1, 3) of the rails together wiih platform imil "b", is provided to enable the wagon to shde to rest on one side, against a wooden buffer wall "g" (Fig-1, 3), when the tij^ler rotates.<br>
Alternatively<br>
The sliding arrangement of the platform "f and wooden buffer support "g" (Fig-3) "lay be replaced by electrically operated hydraulic plunger arrangement identical to locking arrangement "g" (Fig-3). By this arrangement the electncally operated hydraulic plunger locks the wagon on the side. Thus the wagon will be locked from the top and side by electrically operated hydraulic plungers and at the bottom by rails and wheels. This alternative arrangement will reduce theweightofthe Rotary cage equivalent to the extentof the weight of sliding arrangement.<br>
v,   A motor/generator "h" (Fig-3, &amp; 5) coupled to a gearbox and Electro-magnetic brake.<br>
vi-   Hopper "j" (Fig-3): for receiving discharged material.<br>
With an empty wagon, the system is balanced. Only a small force to overcome fnctional force is requu-ed for rotatmg the cylindrical cage. This force can be supplied even manually or by a small motor.<br>
When a loaded wagon replaces the empty wagon, top becomes heavy; the system becomes unbalanced to tih. While tilting, the unbalanced load in the tippler generates substantial force proportional to the load in the wagon. These unbalanced forces force the cylindrical cage of tippler to rotate abruptly. If no control is provided accident may happen. To prevent such uncontrolled motion of the rotating cage using has provided a braking arrangement of either,<br>
(a)	an electromagnetic brake or<br>
(b)	a geared-motor/generator of adequate capacity<br>
(c)	or both, so that the rotary movement of the cylindrical cage is controlled<br>
If case of using only an electromagnetic brake, the generated energy goes waste, while with a motor/generator the energy generated can be utilized. For safety, both brake and motor generator has been used. In case of motor failure, the brake will take over control. Speed of rotation of the cylmdncal cage can be controlled by the gear ratio of the gearbox.<br>
The force generated by the unbalanced rotating cage forces the motor to rotate. The rotatu^ cage now works as prime mover to the motor. In this position the motor instead of motoring starts generating. The generated power has to be absorbed either,<br>
(a)	by an electrical load (e.g. a Resistor), or<br>
(b)	the generated power has to be supplied back to the supply bus.<br>
Quantum of regenerated power will be proportional to the material load in the wagon.. Theoreticallyforevery 787.562 ft-pounds of work, 1 kW-h of electricity is generated. Capacity of Motor/generator shall be such that it should be more than the power generated.<br>
Dunng the tippling operation, regenerative braking by the motor/generator together with electromagnetic brakes will regulate the angular movement if the tippling speed tends to increase. In the event of motor/generator failure, the brake takes over, to avoid accident. Such dual braking will make tippling operation absolutely smooth and tree from risks.<br><br>
-■\fter tippling, the cylmdrical cage along with the empty wagon becomes balffliced again. The motor/generator now acts as a motor to bring back the cylindncal cage with the erapt\' wagon, to the nontiai position. The empty wagon is shunted out and is ready lor the next tippling.<br>
Noveltj-:<br>
a.	The tippler generaies electric power while tippling. Electncity generated is a by¬<br>
product and is fed back to the supply bus.<br>
While in the other system, the Tippler only consumes enormous power.<br>
b.	In case of system failure, the Tippler can be operated manually using brake.<br>
While in the other svstem Tipplers function stops.<br>
c.	Except for unbalanced load, the system is balanced, as such pressure on the gear teeth<br>
is only due to the unbalanced load. This reduces wear and tear of Gear Teeth<br>
increasing life even at^r prolonged use.<br>
While in the other system the gear-teeth have to absorb entire pressure due to the weight of Rotary cage, wagon and material load of wagon, to damage the tooth faster.<br>
d.	This Tippler can be set to tipple up to 175 degree, almost upside down, ensuring cent<br>
per cent discharge of material of the wagon.<br>
In the other designs, it tipples up to 160 degree. Invariably 100 Kg. or more materials have either to be manually retrieved or returned along with the wagons at a loss to the consignee.<br>
e.	This concept of Wagon tippling makes the whole requirement of foundation simple, as<br>
the tippler has to handle onJy the static load of the Tippler plus the d&gt;7)amic<br>
unbalanced vibrating load of material m the wagon.<br>
Whereas for the conventional tipplers, an elaborate foundation has to be made to take Ciffe of the entire load, which is dynamic/vibrating,<br>
f Conventional Tipplers a rake load of materials take a minimum of 75 seconds per Wagon, while tins new TIPPLER, can do the same job in lesser time, simply by changing the geai" drive ratio and /or controlling the brakes, at no additional cost.<br>
Whereas for the conventional tipplers faster speed of tippling require larger motor.<br>
g.    Size for size, cost of this tippler, installation and mamtenance is cheaper.<br>
h.    This Tippler can be manufactured, even at site, thus reducing transportation cost<br><br><br>
