				<td>SELECTIVE ENZYMATIC ESTERIFICATION AND SOLVOLYSIS OF EPIMERIC VITAMIN D ANALOG AND SEPARATION OF THE EPIMERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of selectively enzymatically esterifying and selectively enzymatically solvolyzing epimers at C-24 of analogs of vitamin D and esters thereof. The present invention further relates to methods of separating mixed epimers of analogs of vitamin D including a selective enzymatic esterification step or a selective enzymatic solvolysis step.<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims the benefit of the filing date of United States Provisional Patent Applications 60/348,082, filed January 10,2002, and 60/349,977, filed January 18,2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the discovery of la, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), the hormonally active metabolite form of vitamin D3, many analogs have been prepared in order to obtain active compounds with low calcemic affect. Much effort has been expended on modification of the vitamin D side chain. While the la hydroxyl group is essential for the hormonal activity, the C-25 hydroxyl group can be replaced with the C-24 hydroxyl group: see, for example, MC 903, (Structure I) or 1,24 -(OH)2 D3 (Structure II).<br>
In the preparation of Vitamin D analogs, a specific stereochemistry for the hydroxyl group at C-24 is necessary for full expression of the biological activity. Under current methodology, the required stereochemistry is introduced by one of three methods: (i) separation of diastereomeric mixture of C-24 hydroxyl epimers via chromatography (see, for example, Calverley, Tetrahedron 4609-4619,1987); (ii) stereoselective reduction of the corresponding C-24 ketone, (see, for example, US patent 6262283), or (iii) attachment of an enantiopure hydroxyl-carrying side-chain to the Vitamin D skeleton (see, for example, Calverley, Synlett 157-159,1990).<br>
The stereoselective synthesis is still an unfavorable process for scale up due to its multi-step nature and cost. The chromatographic separation of the epimeric mixture is<br>
most widely practiced. The difficulty in chromatographic separation stems from the fact<br>
that the two C-24 hydroxyl epimers do not differ greatly in their affinity for the adsorbent,<br>
and thus their retention times are too close to allow efficient separation in one chromatographic step. The present invention provides a means to greatly improve the efficacy of chromatographic separation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, a vitamin D analog means any compound having the basic cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol structure and modifications thereof, including those in which an exocychc double bond of the A ring is at different positions and / or in which the structure of the side-chain attached to the D ring at carbon 17 is varied, particularly those modifications (analogs) in which the side chain has a cyclopropyl or isopropyl group at C-24.<br>
Because vitamin D is a steroid, we retain, to the extent possible, the ring designation and numbering system from the parent compound, cholesterol.<br>
resentative vitamin D derivatives that are objects of present invention are illustrated below (structures I and II).<br>
Structures I and II<br>
(Structure Removed) <br><br>
Epimers are known as diastereomers that have opposite configuration (JR. or S) at only one of multiple tetrahedral stereogenic centers in molecules, like the vitamin D analogs to which the present invention is directed, having multiple stereogenic centers. Epimers of vitamin D analogs useful in the practice of the present invention are diasteromers with respect to the configuration at C-24.<br>
Designation of, for example, C-24 as the epimeric center of a pair of enantiomers therefore implies that the configuration at the other stereogenic centers of the pair are the same.<br>
Unless otherwise required by the context, as used herein in connection with epimers and mixtures of epimers of vitamin D analogs having a hydroxyl group at the C-24 position, selective enzymatic esterification and selectively enzymatically esterified mean that the hydroxyl group at the 24 position of one epimer is esterified with an esterification agent with the aid of an enzyme to the substantial exclusion of esterification of the hydroxyl group at the 24 position of the other epimer. Substantial exclusion implies that, of all molecules esterified, at least about 80 mole-% of one epimer and not more than about 20% of the other epimer is esterified (diastereomer ratio 80:20). Preferably the diastereomer ratio is at least 90:10; most preferably it is at least 95:5. The<br>
Called artisan will know to optimize the process variables hereinbelow discussed to achieve the desired diasteromer ratio.<br>
Unless otherwise required by the context, as used herein in connection with epimers and mixtures of epimers of vitamin D analogs having an ester group (e.g. acetate) at the 24 position, selective enzymatic solvolysis and selectively enzymatically solvolyzed mean that the ester group at the 24 position of one epimer is solvolyzed to the substantial exclusion of solvolysis of the ester group at the 24 position of the other epimer. Substantial exclusion implies that, of all molecules solvolyzed, at least about 80 mole-% of one epimer and not more than about 20% of the other epimer are solvolyzed (diastereomer ratio 80:20). Preferably the ratio is at least 90:10; most preferably it is at least 95:5. The skilled artisan will know to optimize the process variables hereinbelow discussed to achieve the desired diasteromer ratio.<br>
As used herein, lower alky means a linear or branched alkyl group, which may be cyclic or acyclic, having one to ten carbon atoms. The isopropyl group and the cyclopropyl group are examples of lower alkyl groups.<br>
As used herein, aryl is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group having six to twelve carbon atoms. The phenyl group is an example of an aryl group.<br>
In the present invention, solvolysis is carried out with a solvolysis agent, preferably a polar protic solvent. Preferred polar protic solvents are water and lower aliphatic alcohols.<br>
Enzymatic and enzymatically mean that the respective process is effected with an enzyme. Preferred enzymes are lipases. Alcalagenes sp. lipase and Pseudomonas sp. lipase are preferred lipases for use in the practice of the present invention. The enzyme can be fixed (immobilized) or free. Procedures for immobilizing enzymes are well known in the art.<br>
As used herein, esterification of a hydroxyl group is synonymous with acylation and means any of the reactions known in the art that replace the hydrogen of an alcoholic hydroxyl group with an acyl group (e.g. RC(O)—).<br>
The separation methods of the present invention employ either a selective enzymatic esterification step or a selective enzymatic solvolysis step and, in preferred embodiments, a chromatograpbic step. The selective enzymatic esterification step is<br>
referred when compounds having an isopropyl group (IT) or a cyclopropyl group (I) at C-24 are the object of the process.<br>
We have now found that a mixture of C-24 epimers of vitamin D analogs having a hydroxyl group at an epimeric center at C-24 can be selectively esterified at the 24 position in the presence of an enzyme, preferably a lipase, producing a mixture of the C-24 ester of one epimer and the original C-24 alcohol of the non-esterified epimer. This is illustrated below in scheme I. It is not important to the present invention which epimer is selectively esterified.<br>
We have also found that an epimeric mixture of C-24 esters of vitamin D analogs can be selectively solvolyzed, in the presence of an enzyme, preferably a lipase, to yield a mixture of the C-24 ester of one epimer and the C-24 alcohol epimer of the other. This is illustrated below in scheme II. Scheme II is illustrated with aceryl chloride, but other esterification agents are equally useful. It is not important to the practice of the present invention which epimer is selectively solvolyzed. We discovered that an ester can be formed at the C-24 position of vitamin D analogs, without simultaneous esterification of hydroxyl groups on the A ring of the vitamin D analog. Thus, the present method can be practiced without having to protect OH groups on, for example, the A ring of the vitamin D derivative.<br>
Scheme I<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme II<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Although it is not necessary in the practice of the invention, it may be convenient to protect the hydroxyl groups on the A-ring of the vitamin D analogs. Any of the methods for protecting the hydroxyl groups as are known in the art can be used, if desired. The tert-butyldimethylsilyl group is but one example of hydroxyl protecting group that can be used in the practice of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides for selective enzymatic esterification of a vitarninn D analog. In selective enzymatic esterification, the vitamin D analogue (e.g., general structure - III or IX), consisting of a mixture of C-24 OH epimers, and an esterification (acylating) agent (A), are dissolved in an organic solvent (SI) to provide a solution that is then contacted with an enzyme (E), preferably a lipase. Suitable solvents (SI) include linear and branched aJkanes having up to about 12 carbon, for example hexane, and dialkyl ethers,, for example diisopropyl ether. Alkyl and alkeny<br>
esters are examples of suitable esterification agents. Vinyl acetate is a preferred esterification agent. The solution is contacted (e.g. stirred) with enzyme (E) at a specified temperature (T) for a period of time (t). Any temperature that does not destroy the activity of the enzyme can be used. Temperatures between about 20°C and about 40°C are preferred. The skilled artisan will know to adjust the reaction time according to the progress of the reaction. The progress of the esterification reaction can be followed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A Merck-Hitachi Model 6200 A using 0.5% amyl alcohol in hexane as the mobile phase is suitable for use. The skilled artisan   • will also know to adapt a suitable analytical method from the preparative chromatographic method described below. The same analytical method can be used in all embodiments of the present invention. The esterification is stopped when enough of the undesired epimer has been esterified to ensure a diastereomeric excess of the C-24 alcohol of at least about 80%, preferably at least about 95%.<br>
At this point, the enzyme is separated (removed) by suitable means as will be known to the skilled artisan, for example filtration or centrifugation to mention just two, and the filtrate is concentrated.<br>
In another embodiment, the present method provides for selective enzymatic solvolysis of an esterified vitamin D analog. Selective enzymatic solvolysis can be illustrated with selective enzymatic alcoholysis, in which case the step can also be called selective enzymatic transesterification. The vitamin D analogue (e.g., general structure -III), consisting of a mixture of C-24 OH epimers, is esterified to a mixture of C-24 epimeric esters via standard methods well known to the skilled artisan, such as using an acyl halide, acid anhydride, or an active ester such as a vinyl alkanoate. This mixture of epimeric esters is then dissolved in an organic solvent (SI), especially a lower alkane or dialkyl ether as above, containing a solvolysis agent, especially a lower alkyl alcohol (R-OH) or water, to provide a solution that is contacted with an enzyme (E), prefereably a lipase. The contacting (e.g. mixing) is at a specified temperature (T) for a period of time (t) and the progress of the solvolysis reaction is followed by HPLC. The solvents, solvolysis agents, temperatures, and times useful for selective enzymatic esterification are also useful in the present embodiment. The reaction is stopped when enough of the C-24 alcohol epimer has been selectively formed in the required diastereomeric excess of at least about 80%, preferably above 95%. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the C-24 OH epimer formed by transesterification not be the desired (sought) epimer.<br>
At this point, the enzyme is removed by filtration (or other suitable means such as centrifugation) and the filtrate is concentrated.<br>
In yet another embodiment, selective enzymatic solvolysis is carred out with water. In this case the step can be referred to as selective enzymatic hydrolysis. The vitamin D analogue (e.g., general structure - HI), consisting of a mixture of C-24 OH epimers, is esterified to a mixture of C-24 epimeric esters via standard methods (such as using an acyl halide^ acid anhydride or an active ester such as a vinyl alkanoate etc). This mixture of epimeric esters is then dissolved in an organic solvent (SI) containing water and an enzyme (E) such as a lipase. The mixture is stirred at a specified temperature (T) for a period of time (t) and the progress of the hydrolysis reaction is followed by HPLC. The reaction is stopped when enough of the C-24 alcohol epimer has been selectively formed in the desired diastereomeric excess of at least about 80%, preferably at least about 95%. In this embodiement, it is preferred that the C-24 alcohol formed is the C-24 alcohol of the undesired epimer and the nonhydrolyzed ester is the ester of the desired C-24 OH epimer.<br>
At this point, the enzyme is removed by appropriate means as will be apparent to the skilled srtisan, for example filtration or centrifugation to mention just two. The filtrate is concentrated.<br>
Because of the now much larger difference in polarity between the C-24 alcohol and the C-24 ester, the selectively esterified or selectively solvolyzed epimers now have well-resolved elution tunes, thereby allowing the complete separation of the mixtures, however prepared, in a single-pass by, for example, column chromatography as described below. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of separating C-24 epimers of vitamin D analogs having a hydroxyl group at the C-24 stereogenic center that includes a step selected fromselective enzymatic esterification and selective enzymatic solvolysis<br>
To obtain separate epimers, the concentrate from selective enzymatic esterification or selective enzymatic solvolysis is then loaded onto a chromatographic column, described below, and eluted by a suitable solvent or solvent mixture (S2) so as to separate the C-24 alcohol (V) from the C-24 ester (TV) and, similarly, to separate XI from X, as described in Scheme I. In Scheme I, the ester formed at C-24 is an acetate, but other esters, for example the butyrate, are equally useful. In another embodiment the C-<br>
24 alcohol is separated from the C-24 ester, preferably the ester of of the desired epitner (Scheme II). In Scheme EL, the esterifying agent is an acyl chloride, but other esterification agents, for example acid anhydrides, are equally useful.<br>
Separated ester can be converted to the desired alcohol by methods well known in the art, whereby one obtains esentially stereochemically pure C-24 hydroxy epimers from a mixture of epimers. Thus, is does not matter which of the epimers is desired, because the methods described herein can produce either of them.<br>
Examples of values that can be selected for several reaction parameters in the practice of the several embodiments of the present invention are collected below.<br>

Scheme III<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
For the chromatography step, any combination of stationary phase (packing) and eluent that is capable of resolving the mixture of C-24 alcohol and C-24 ester can be used. Such combinations can be readily determined by the skilled artisan by routine experimentation. An example of a preferred stationary phase is treated silica.<br>
Column chromatography, useful for the separation of selectively esterified or selectively solvolyzed vitamin D analogs of the present invention is well known to those in the art of pharmaceutical chemistry. The technique employs a column packed with a stationary phase, for example treated silica, onto which a sample to be separated is loaded. The sample is then eluted with a suitable eluent. Elution can be isocratic or so-called solvent programmed, wherein the composition of the eluent is varied regularly (e.g. linearly) or irregularly (e.g. stepwise) over time. Pre-treated silica gel, well known in the chromatographic arts, is a suitable stationary phase. Elution with 5% (v/v) ethyl acetate in hexane followed by neat ethyl acetate is but one example of an elution program that produces the desired separation. Others suitable eluents will be deduced by the skilled artisan through routine methods development.<br>
