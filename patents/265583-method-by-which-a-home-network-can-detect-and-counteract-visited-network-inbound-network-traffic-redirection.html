Both of those patent applications are in their entirety incorporated herein by this reference.<br>
BACKGROUND Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to counteracting steering of inbound roaming by a visited public mobile network.<br>
Background of the Technology<br>
[0002]United States Patent Application Number 20040087305 (publication number 10/635,804) entitled "Method and System for Cellular Network Traffic Redirection" discloses a method within a mobile telecommunications network such as a GSM network environment, for redirecting a home network (HPMN) operator's outbound reamers' traffic to preferred visited networks or according to distribution control of the home operator's determination. An embodiment of that type of outbound Traffic Redirection (TR) solution is based on MAP signaling and is deployed on the network side that is SIM independent and deals with handset idiosyncrasies. Since the filing of that United States patent application, dozens of (HPMN) operators have deployed or are about to deploy that type of MAP signaling-based network TR solution in their networks. Furthermore, the GSM Association has also published its guideline IR 73 regarding this type of traffic redirection service termed as Steering of Roaming (SoR).<br><br><br>
[0003]A provisional United States Provisional Patent Application (publication number 60/670,914), entitled "Method and Apparatus for Redirection of Inbound Roamer Traffic" teaches a method by which a visited mobile telecommunications network (VPMN) can provide a form of inbound traffic redirection (ITR) such that it can retain inbound roamers, or improve its chances of preventing those inbound roamers from unwittingly leaving that visited network and latching on to a different visited network. [0004]Successful TR or SoR, necessarily results in certain VPMN operators losing lucrative inbound roaming traffic. Accordingly, those visited network operators will become interested in technological measures to combat TR. Provisional United States Patent Application (publication number 60/662,030) entitled "Method and Apparatus for Defense Against Network Traffic Redirection" and a non-Provisional United States Patent Application based thereon filed March 14, 2006 entitled "Anti-Traffic Redirection System" teaches such a method of automatically combating traffic redirection at the visited network. The invention disclosed there serves to make an inbound roamer's registration with the VPMN successful by defeating both HPMN's attempt to engage in outbound TR and a competitor VPMN's attempt to retain the roamer by technological measures such as ITR. Anticipating the need for VPMNs to use technological measures to counter these attempts to oppose outbound or inbound TR, provisional United States Patent Application (publication number 60/662,031) entitled, "Method and Apparatus for Defense Against Defense Against Network Traffic Redirection," and a non-Provisional United States Patent Application based thereon filed March 14, 2006 entitled, "Method, System and Computer Program Product for Countering Anti-Traffic Redirection" teach such approaches for an HPMN to counter possible anti-TR measures attempted by an VPMN. [0005]Yet there is a need in the art for a means by which a first VPMN can neutralize or defeat the technological measures by which competing VPMNs attempt to steer away, or retain inbound roaming traffic in the face of that first VPMN's attempted inbound traffic redirection.<br>
Summary<br>
[0006]To further protect the HPMN operators' investment in TR, the present invention provides a set of technological measures by which a can counter anti-TR attempts by undesired VPMNs in the coverage area of the HPMN's desired VPMN.   This<br><br><br>
solution detects and defends against a VPMN operator's possible tactics to delay an inbound roamer's attempt to leave the VPMN so to register other networks within the same country as the VPMN. It makes the following claims within the GSM network environment<br>
1.	The general framework of using MAP signaling to detect about the VPMN's ITR and so to produce corresponding actions and reports<br>
2.	The general framework of using MAP signaling to defend against the VPMN's inbound TR<br>
[0007]Although GSM is the underlying technology and focus, it is also expected similar ideas can be easily transferred to other technologies including without limitation CDMA, WiFi, WiMax VoIP, GPRS or others.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]According to the present invention, a solution for counteracting visited network (VPMN) based inbound network traffic redirection (hereinafter "anti-ITR") can be deployed in the HPMN network within the signaling path, or in other embodiments by<br><br><br>
means of a monitoring approach. It can be implemented or deployed as an add-on module of the in signaling-path based HPMN TR solution.<br>
[0016]Figure 1 illustrates an architecture for anti-ITR in an in-signaling path embodiment. In this architecture, roaming SCCP messages including Location Update Messages can be redirected thru the anti-ITR 100 by the HPMN Roaming STP 101 (Signal Transfer Point) before messages reach HPMN HLR 102. To avoid looping, any number of deployment options may be suitable including without limitation: redundancy with primary and secondary routing are possible improvements on these options.<br>
[0017]Figure 2 depicts another possible routing option under an embodiment of the present invention that does not use Translation Type (TT). In this embodiment, all SCCP messages with CdPA Numbering Plan E214 and CgPA (calling party address) from non-HPMN are sent to DPC (Destination Point Code) of an anti-ITR 200 module, without changing Routing Indicator (Rl) (which could normally be Global Title (GT)-based.) When anti-ITR 200 sends an SCCP message thru a roaming STP 201 to a real HPMN HLR 202, it can use the MTP level routing to route the SCCP message to HPMN HLR 202 without changing Rl.<br>
[0018]Figure 3 depicts yet another routing option under an embodiment using translation type. In this embodiment, all SCCP messages with CdPA (Called-Party-Address) Numbering Plan E214 and CgPA (Calling Party Address) from a non-HPMN are sent to DPC (Destination Point Code) of an anti-ITR module 300 with a new destination translation type (e.g. 32) but without changing Rl. When the anti-ITR 300 relays the message back through a Roaming STP 301, the new transaction type 32 can be applied. In the new translation type 32, all SCCP messages with CdPA Numbering Plan E214 and CgPA from a non-HPMN can be sent to DPC (Destination Point Code) of an HPMN HLR 301 with a destination translation type 0/unknown but without changing Rl.<br>
[0019]Similar approaches can be used to route all SCCP messages with CgPA from an HPMN and CdPA from a non-HPMN and NP being E614 by means of an anti-ITR solution under the present invention. Figure 4 depicts yet another such approach without using translation type, and Figure 5 depicts a possible embodiment that does use translation type. <br>
[0020]Note that the SCCP re-routing options do not necessarily require the rerouting<br>
of SCCP messages of E164 CdPA from HPMN to non-HPMN thru an anti-ITR<br><br><br>
module if the SCCP messages from HPMN to VPMN at the roaming links are monitored. Therefore, use of a monitoring option is depicted in the anti-ITR network architecture.<br>
[0021]But whichever of the foregoing or other possible deployment options are applied, an anti-ITR solution under the present invention normally would receive an outbound roamer's Location Update transactions (including acknowledgement and cancel location from HPMN HLR to VPMN VLR) between VPMN and HPMN. [0022]To the extent a roamer still succeeds in registering on ITR applying VPMN network after an HPMN anti-ITR solution, then the other HPMN can deduce the failure of its HPMN anti-ITR solution and the success of the VPMN ITR solution. If the roamer failed to register on the VPMN network after the anti-ITR solution, then HPMN can deduce the success of the HPMN anti-ITR solution and the failure of the VPMN ITR solution.<br>
[0023]Based on these types of deductions and subsequent success or failure of HPMN anti-ITR, HPMN can produce all kinds of reports including without limitation signaling load overhead, anti-ITR success/failure, percentage of redirected outbound roaming traffic and many other reports of concern to an HPMN or others interested in monitoring or thwarting inbound traffic redirection.<br>
[0024] lf is conceivable that agreements among internationally diverse operators, or initiatives by industry groups such as the GSM Association, or even local laws or regulations could be taken to oppose or even outlaw inbound traffic redirection. The anti-ITR solutions of the present invention can be applied to enforce those initiatives by defeating inbound traffic redirection. As the above example indicates, even to the extent that these solutions fail to defeat inbound traffic redirection, they still may be applied to monitor the occurrence of inbound traffic redirection and send reports to the regulatory bodies, industry associations, or international operators concerned with such violations or use of inbound traffic redirection.<br>
[0025]One key aim of the proposed anti-ITR solutions under the present invention is to hold the MAP Location Update message (when routed thru an anti-ITR solution) regarding an HPMN outbound roamer from a new VPMN (say, VPMN 2) when that roamer is already in the middle of a new location update in another VPMN (say, VPMN 1) and the new VPMN (VPMN 2) has just been canceled with respect to the same roamer. Only if the earlier location update is observed (via rerouting or monitoring) to be aborted or ended with error (System failure, unexpected data<br><br>
value, missing parameter etc) or timed-out without completing the transaction, then the currently-held location update of that roamer on the new VPMN can be allowed to proceed through its normal routing to the HLR. Otherwise the held MAP location update could either be aborted or timed-out or rejected with error (System failure, unexpected data value etc) against the new VPMN (VPMN 2). <br>
[0026]Note that if the earlier location update with the other VPMN (VPMN 1) is successful, then the held location update message would not normally be relayed to the HPMN HLR. Note also that anti-ITR under the present invention need not hold a location update message regarding an HPMN roamer from a VPMN if an earlier location message is already completed (for instance, whether there is an abort or a location update response irrespective of error or not). Neither would anti-ITR under the present invention necessarily hold a location update message regarding an HPMN roamer from a VPMN that has not been previously cancelled on the same roamer.<br>
[0027] Figure 6 depicts an exemplary anti-ITR signal flow under the present invention to defend against the ITR attack by VPMN 2.<br>
1.	Here, an outbound roamer registered with VPMN 2 is registering with a VPMN 1 VLR 600.<br>
2.	VPMN 1 VLR 600 sends LUP to a HPMN HLR 603 (redirected thru the HPMN anti-ITR 602). An HPMN Anti-ITR 602 noted that this LUP transaction is not completed yet<br>
3.	HPMN HLR 603 sends cancel location to the VPMN 2 VLR/ITR 601 (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 602). The HPMN anti-ITR 602 noted the VPMN 2 to where the cancel-location is sent.<br>
4.	VPMN 2 ITR 601 solution fakes a location update as if the roamer were back in VPMN 2. HPMN anti-ITR 602 holds the LUP message from VPMN 2 because HPMN is still in the middle of the LUP transaction with VPMN 1 regarding the same roamer and the LUP comes from the VPMN that a cancel-location has just been sent to on the same roamer<br>
5.	HPMN HLR 603 sends ISD to the VPMN 1 VLR 600 (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 602)<br>
6.	VPMN 1 VLR 600 sends ISD ack back to the HPMN HLR 603<br><br><br><br>
7.	HPMN HLR 603 sends LUP ACK to the VPMN 1 VLR 600 (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 602). HPMN Anti-ITR 602 notes that the VPMN 1 LUP transaction is completed<br>
8.	HPMN anti-ITR 602 sends LUP error on the held VPMN 2 LUP to VPMN 2 VLR/ITR 601<br>
[0028]Figure 7 depicts an exemplary signal flow of a genuine concurrent registration under the present invention.<br>
1.	Here, an inbound roamer registered with VPMN 2 is registering with VPMN 1.<br>
2.	VPMN 1 VLR 700 sends LUP to HPMN HLR 703 (redirected thru a HPMN anti-ITR 702). HPMN Anti-ITR 702 noted this transaction is not completed yet<br>
3.	HPMN HLR 703 sends cancel location to VPMN 2 VLR/ITR 701 (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 702). HPMN anti-ITR 702 notes the VPMN 2 to which the cancel-location is sent.<br>
4.	VPMN 2 VLR 701 sends a genuine a location update because the roamer is immediately back in VPMN 2. HPMN anti-ITR 702 holds the LUP message from VPMN 2 because HPMN is still in the middle of the LUP transaction with VPMN 1 on the same roamer and the LUP comes from the VPMN that a cancel-location has just been sent to on the same roamer<br>
5.	HPMN HLR 703 sends LUP reject error to VPMN 1 VLR 700 (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 702). HPMN Anti-ITR 702 notes that the VPMN 1 LUP transaction is completed with error. HPMN anti-ITR 702 then relays the held VPMN 2 LUP to HPMN HLR 703<br>
6.	HPMN HLR 703 sends ISD (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 702) to VPMN 2 VLR 701<br>
7.	VPMN 2 VLR 701 sends ISD ack to HPMN HLR 703<br>
8.	HPMN HLR 703 sends LUP ack (redirected thru or monitored by the HPMN anti-ITR 702) to VPMN 2 VLR 701<br>
Other Variations<br>
[0029]Provided above for the edification of those of ordinary skill in the art, and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention, are detailed illustrations of a scheme for generating and provisioning the CSI of the outbound roamer in a wireless communication network, who has moved onto a VPMN and is detected as being<br><br>
registering with the VPMN. Numerous variations and modifications within the spirit of the present invention will of course occur to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments that have now been disclosed. For example, while in the described embodiments, the present invention is implemented primarily from the point of view of GSM mobile networks, the present invention may also be effectively implemented on CDMA, 3G, WCDMA, GPRS, etc., or any other network of common carrier telecommunications in which end users are normally configured to operate within a "home" network to which they normally subscribe, but have the capability of also operating on other neighboring or remote visited networks. [0030]The examples under the present invention, detailed in the illustrative examples contained here, are described using terms and constructs drawn largely from GSM mobile telephony infrastructure. However, use of these examples should not be interpreted to limiting the invention to those media. The capabilities of the visited or non-accustomed network can be of use and provided through any type of telecommunications medium, including without limitation: (i) any mobile telephony network including, without limitation, GSM, 3GSM, 3G, CDMA, WCDMA or GPRS, satellite phones or other mobile telephone networks or systems; (ii) any so-called WiFi apparatus normally used in a home or subscribed network, but also configured for use on a visited or non-home or non-accustomed network, including apparatus not dedicated to telecommunications such as personal computers, Palm-type or Windows Mobile devices; (iii) an entertainment console platform such as Sony Playstation, PSP or other apparatus that are capable of sending and receiving telecommunications over home or non-home networks, or even (iv) fixed-line devices made for receiving communications, but capable of deployment in numerous locations while preserving a persistent subscriber id such as the eye2eye devices from Dlink; or telecommunications equipment meant for voice over IP communications such as those provided by Vonage or Packet8.<br><br>
