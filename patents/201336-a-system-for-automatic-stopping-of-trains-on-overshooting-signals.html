				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Whenever the signal on signal post (81) is displaying RED signal (4B5, 4B6), the additional transformer (47) gets energized and rectified output (48) is fed in to additional rails that are on either side (50A) of the track through a cable (49) to charge them. Now if a train overshoots it, the curved arm of the pick up shoe (61) suspended from the Locomotive comes into physical contact (82) with additional rail pieces (50). Then, charged state is passed to Switching circuit (90) through pick up shoe (61) and cable (63) to activating it. The switching circuit (90) energizes a relay (9K) and through its TI set&#x27; pickup contact, power is supplied through cable (9D) to the spool valve (70) at one end (78) operating (72) &amp; making the air pressure in the train brake pipe (223) to fall down suddenly. Fall of pressure in (223) causes the train brakes to be applied (33) to the running train. Simultaneously, the locomotive is brought to idle condition through the operation of appropriate relays (26). To normalize the system, the Locomotive driver needs to get down from locomotive and press l^t reset switch (9E) provided under the walkway of Locomotive. This normalizes the Electronic system. However, the Train brake system does not normalize until the driver gets back in to his seat and operates the 2^^^ reset switch provided in his cabin (9G). The reset voltage is now applied through cable (9F) to the resetting coil at one end (79) of the Solenoid (73) of spool valve (70) and normalcy is restored in the Train brake pipeline. When the pressure in the train brake (223) pipe attains 5 kg/cm^, the train can be moved normally.</td>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10-; rule 13)<br><br>
44<br><br>
A system for automatic stopping of trains on overshooting signals "<br><br>
II       National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd; Ramagundam National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd; JYOTHINAGAR RAMAGUNDAM Dist: Karimnagar<br>
ANDHRA PRADESH; Pin : 505215 INDIA<br>
An Indian National Govt, of India Undertaking Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it performs.<br><br>
A system for automatic stopping of trains on over shooting signals Background<br>
The present invention relates to a system that automatically brakes and brings to halt a running train (goods or passenger trains) in a situation where the driver of the train fails to brake and stop the train on approaching the stop or danger signal. This system is particularly useful where electric signaling systems are used on the rail network and where the locomotives and the attached wagons/coaches of the trains are provided with pneumatic braking systems. This system can also be used in Semaphore Signaling system using Position Switches and exclusive power supply.<br>
In most of the rail network in India and in the rail network used by NTPC at Ramagundam, India, the onus of braking the train and bringing it to halt at signal sites is entirely on the driver of the locomotive and is hence prone to human errors. If by oversight the driver fails to read the signal correctly or ignores the signal there are many possibilities of the running train ramming into or colliding with another train that is either rurming or stationary on the same track resulting in fatal accidents. At present there are no back-up systems on the rail network that can take over the job of braking the train and bringing it to halt under such situations.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
To overcome the above drawback of the present system, a novel system- a system for automatic stopping of trains on over shooting signals - has been constructed with the incorporation of following inventive steps:<br>
•	Means for generating a signal that is representative of signaling condition (Aspect of the Signal) and which is linked to the normal signal switching circuit operated from the control room<br>
•	Means for picking up the generated signal<br>
•	Means for processing the signal<br>
•	Means for converting the processed signal into mechanical action of application of brakes and halting of the locomotive and the associated coaches/wagons.<br>
•	Means for normalizing the system after the braking contingency is removed.<br><br>
The various means are exemplified here under. However it must be construed that the exemplified means are no way binding as many of the equivalent means are possible with in the realm of the known art and the scope of the invention and the claims covers these equivalences too.<br>
• The means for generating the signal can be either the Pentograph or Using a set of additional rails with an additional step down transformer incorporated in the normal signal switching circuitry.<br>
The means for picking up the signal can be either the Electromagnetic system. Optical system. Wireless system or a Pick up shoe in combination with a set of rails placed on either side of the track.<br>
The means for processing the generated signal includes IC 555 in Bi-stable multi vibrator mode, IC 7812 as voltage regulator or any other similar Switching circuit with different ICs (Integrated Circuits) or discreet components, relays. Voltage source, which is tapped from Locomotive battery or through a DC-DC converter or an exclusive additional battery arrangement, the associated cabling and electronics.<br>
•	The means involved in the conversion of processed signal into mechanical<br>
action includes the braking solenoid, spool valve, air balancing tank and<br>
Nozzle apart from the normal braking subsystems present in the<br>
locomotive.<br>
However in the Preferred embodiment,<br>
•	Means for generating a signal that is representative of signaling condition is an additional transformer incorporated in the normal signaling circuit<br>
•	Means for picking up the generated signal is the pick up shoe in combination with set of rails placed on either side of the rail track.<br>
One such system has been successfully commissioned and operationalised at NTPC Ramagundam rail network and is known as Merry Go Round (MGR)<br>
System.<br><br>

Description of the Preferred embodiment. The preferred embodiment has the following features:<br>
•	Incorporation of a set of additional rail pieces (50) which are electrically conducting, which are approximately equal (2.0 mts) in length, which are welded with GI sheets (56) to prevent corrosion, which are tapered (54) at the edges for smooth engagement and disengagement of curved arm of Pickup shoe (61), which are located on the permanent way, which are mounted in such a way using known means (55), which are electrically insulted (53) from the sleepers, which lie on the exteriors of either side of the track (50 A) such that these rails can be used in the UP and DOWN directions without any hindrance to normal movement, which are in parallel alignment to the track (50 A), which are at a suitable location at the Signal post, depending on the maximum speed allowed in that section as well as the gradient of that section so that the train can be brought to a stop safely in case of overshooting the signal post when the aspect is RED and is charged with the signal from the additional transformer &amp; Rectifier (47 &amp; 48) through a cable (49).<br>
•	Incorporation of an additional step down transformer (47) and rectifier (48) in the signal switching circuit that can apply a DC voltage across the set of additional rail pieces (50) such that the applied voltage is a representative of the voltage existing across the signal bulb (4B5). This is achieved by tapping into the llOV AC line feeding (4B1) the red aspect of the signal. This AC voltage is stepped down by a transformer (47), rectified into 12V DC (48) and fed to set of additional rails (50) through cable (49) in such a way that the negative of this supply is connected to the main track.<br>
•	Incorporation of a Pick up shoe (60), which is made of rail quality steel, that transmits the voltage, applied to the set of additional rail pieces (50) through a cable (63) as input voltage (9C) to Switching circuit (90). The arm of Pickup shoe (61) is in sectoral shape, which is firmly suspended from the mid-ladder portion of the Locomotive using known mechanical means such that the curved arm of pickup shoe (61) glides over the set of additional rail pieces (50) making an electrical contact and with out any hindrance to the normal traction of the locomotive.<br><br>
Incorporation of a spring (62) for loading the pickup shoe such that the spring exerts sufficient force on the curved arm of pickup shoe (61) to maintain the physical contact with the set of additional rail pieces (50) during its travel over it.<br>
Incorporation of an air balancing tank (222) and nozzle (75) in the airline of the braking system between MU2B valve (22) and A9 valve (23).<br>
Incorporation of switching relay (9K) through whose normal 'set Y contacts and its cable (9H), supplies the voltage from Pickup shoe (60) to Switching circuit IC (9J), making the relay (9K) to energize so that 24 V is available at 'set 11' pickup contact (9D)<br>
Incorporation of solenoid braking coil (72) which is energized when its other end (78) is connected to the cable (9D) from switching circuit (90) and operates the spool valve (70) in the pneumatic braking system so that the Train braking system of the prime mover is activated. Locomotive brought to idle condition (26) and the brakes (31) are applied (33) on the wheels (32) of the wagons.<br>
Incorporation of a set of reset switches (2 in number), first reset switch (9E) which resets the switching circuit (90) and makes the reset voltage available at (9G) the second reset switch and through this second reset switch, 24 V reset voltage is made available at cable (9F) which in turn energizes solenoid reset coil (73) of Solenoid (70) provided for restoring the normal operating conditions.<br><br>
Working of the System<br>
Usually there, are two pneumatic braking systems on the locomotives used in the rail network in India. The first brake system is used to brake the locomotive alone when it is not attached to any other wagon or coach. The second system is used to brake the train when the locomotive is attached to wagons or coaches or both. In the first system the driver of the locomotive operates valve SA9 (25). In the second   system the driver operates the valve A9 (23).<br>
As a skilled person in the art is aware, the pneumatic braking system makes use of the pressure differential existing inside the braking cylinders and the outside atmosphere. The pressure is exerted on the piston head by the compressed air. Each wagon/coach is equipped with such brake piston, cylinders and a distributor valve to sense the pressure in the train pipeline. Usually the pressure is regulated by the use of A9 valve (23). This A9 valve has four Opening/braking positions (Viz. 25% opening; 50% opening; 75% opening and 100 % opening). The forth position of 100% represents Emergency Braking. The driver operates the valve depending on the situation he faces. In to this pipe line, a spool valve (70) is fixed. The spool valve (70) is a three-way passage valve. One passage (76) cormects to the Train air-braking pipeline, the second passage connects to the air-balancing tank (222) and the third passage cormects to a nozzle (75), which is open to the atmosphere. Usually a pressure of 5Kgf/cm2 is maintained through out the brake system and train brake pipeline. Even a drop of 0.2 Kg/cm2 is enough to activate the braking shoes (31) on to the wheels (32). Pressure differential is obtained in the Train brake distribution valve, VAIB (21) by opening the air in the Train brake pipeline (76) to atmosphere through nozzle (75). The braking effort obtained is in proportion to the nozzle diameter of the spool valve. Here in this case, the nozzle diameter is such that the resultant<br><br>
pressure on the brake shoes (31) is equal to the pressure obtained when A9 valve (23) is opened 100% or opened to emergency position and hence results in maximum braking effort. This sudden drop in pressure in brake pipe also activates C 2 relay valve and PCS (26) which brings the Locomotive to Idle or Neutral condition.<br>
As the over shooting of the signals occur, the curved arm of pick up shoe (61) contacts the set of additional rail pieces (50) making the electrical contact. The sensed DC voltage (12V) on the set of rails is passed through the pick up shoe curved arm (61) and is made available at pin No. 8 of the IC 555 through cable (63) and 'set V normal contact of the relay (9K). This circuit gets energized and pin No. 3 of the IC 555 goes high from OV to 12 V .The relay (9K) picks up. The picked up position is sustained as pin No. 8 of IC 555 continues to get supply through 'set-1 pick up contact. Meanwhile the 'set-IF relay contacts also operate simultaneously sending 24 V DC to braking solenoid coil (72) of the spool valve through cable 9D. The spool valve operates and brakes are applied to the railway wagons. After the train comes to a halt the driver of the locomotive needs to operate the reset button that is located below the walkway of the Locomotive (9E). Thus pin no 4 of IC 555 circuit is taken to a high position, driving pin No. 3 to low position or 0 Volts. The relay 9K drops as a result and a reset voltage is made available through 'set-II' normal contact to another push button (9G) situated in the driver's cabin. The driver should get into the cabin and operate this switch. Once this switch is also operated, the reset solenoid coil (73) of the spool valve gets 24 volts through cable (9F) at its other end (79). Then the spool valve operates resetting the train's pneumatic braking system. Eventually the train brake system attains 5kg/cm2 pressure releasing the wagon brakes and the train can be moved.<br><br><br><br>
