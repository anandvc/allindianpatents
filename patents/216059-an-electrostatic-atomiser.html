				<td>AN ELECTROSTATIC ATOMISER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to electrostatic atomisers applied in any practical system<br>
where the atomisation of fluid is required. It may be for example employed in<br>
a system for the supply of combustion fuel, liquid solutions in say the delivery<br>
of drugs, cosmetic fluids and other synthesized solutions in say household<br>
sprays. The invention as set out in this application is not limited to any of<br>
these particular applications and is intended to be applicable to any atomiser<br>
which falls within the scope of the claims which are included at the end of this<br>
application.<br>
Prior Art known to the Applicant(s)<br>
The present inventive concept is generally concerned with improving<br>
atomisation in electrostatic atomisers by proposing radical departures from the<br>
prior art known to the applicant and detailed herein.<br>
Typically, prior art atomisers comprise a central electrode, an outer electrode<br>
located around said central electrode, and sufficiently spaced from one another<br>
to form a channel in which fluid particles are charged prior to exiting through<br>
orifices. In this configuration, a high potential is customarily applied to the<br>
central electrode whilst the outer electrode is grounded. Reversing these<br>
potentials - i.e. applying the high potential to the outer electrode â€” is not<br>
practical as in its environment there would be either the risk of electrocution<br>
should an operator inadvertently touch the outer electrode or the superfluous<br>
requirement of incorporating an additional insulating layer such as a ceramic<br>
sheath which would add unnecessary complexity. Consequently, prior art<br>
systems exclusively apply the high potential to the central electrode not to the<br>
outer electrode.<br>
Figure 1 shows some of the constraints under which prior art atomisers<br>
operate. Atomisation is a balance between maximum voltage potential,<br>
percentage of potential charge retained in the discharged fluid and the<br>
electrode gap (distance separating the electrodes). In prior art systems as the<br>
electrode gap is increased the maximum voltage potential may be increased<br>
but the critical percentage of potential charge retained in the discharged fluid<br>
is reduced, thus resulting in relatively poor atomisation beyond a given<br>
electrode gap for a given atomiser.<br>
One of the objectives of the present invention is to offer a radically different<br>
approach to atomisation which would to a large extent remove the strict<br>
barriers of design to which prior art systems are generally constrained.<br>
Within the present inventive concept, other more specific prior art systems are<br>
deemed to be relevant and are detailed as follows.<br>
One type of known prior art teaches the use of a single central electrode in an<br>
atomisation system terminating in a sharp point at its fluid interface so as to<br>
generate a relatively high electrical field about that point. One example of<br>
such a system is disclosed in US patent number 6,206,307 (Arnold J Kelly)<br>
where an electrode protrudes into a passing fluid in the form of a generally<br>
conical tip. This, patent discloses in its section which provides a detailed<br>
description of the figures that the tip is formed from a fibrous material having<br>
electrically conductive fibres extending generally in the axial direction of the<br>
electrode and of the body, each such fibre having a microscopic point, these<br>
points co-operatively constituting the surface of the tip. The surfaces defining<br>
the orifice are deprived of any such fibres and are even preferably required to<br>
be smooth. This particular atomiser generally terminates in a point which for<br>
adequate performance requires to be precisely aligned with its orifice 22.<br>
Consequently, strict concentricity tolerances are required to be applied during<br>
its manufacturing. Furthermore, if for any reason, the alignment of the tip<br>
with its orifice is altered during the lifecycle of the atomiser efficiency will<br>
unavoidably suffer.<br>
Another fibrous tip is disclosed in a separate US patent number 4,627,903<br>
(Alan T Chapman) which discloses the use of composite fragments in the<br>
sharp point electrode tip containing sub-micron metallic fibres uniformly<br>
arrayed in a non-conducting (insulating) matrix.<br>
Another type of prior art system discloses electrode tips terminating in a bell<br>
shape (with an annular sharp edge). This configuration is usually utilised in<br>
atomisers incorporating circumferentially arrayed orifices. One example of<br>
such a configuration can be seen in Figure 2 in a paper presented by A. J.<br>
Kelly circa July 1998 at DOE (Diesel Engine Emissions Workshop). Another<br>
example of such an electrode configuration is disclosed in US patent number<br>
5,725,151 (Robert Hetrick).<br>
Each of these bell shaped electrodes has similar stringent concentricity<br>
tolerances requirements to the above presented conical electrodes.<br>
Every prior art configuration referenced above requires strict tolerances to be<br>
achieved and precise electrode tip geometry to be selected for given orifice<br>
arrangements.<br>
One of the objectives of the present invention is to provide an atomiser whose<br>
electrode"s geometry may be applied to a wide variety of orifice<br>
configurations. The present invention therefore aims to provide an altogether<br>
more flexible system with less stringent requirements for tolerances and of tip<br>
geometry.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to provide an atomiser whose design<br>
and manufacture is carried out with improved freedom and which will also be<br>
particularly well suited to high volume production.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to provide an atomiser with improved<br>
atomisation properties both for single orifice atomisers and multi-orifice<br>
atomisers.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In its first broad independent aspect, the invention presents an electrostatic<br>
atomiser, comprising a channel through which, in use, a fluid passes; one or<br>
more orifices to allow the fluid to exit the atomiser; and at least two electrodes<br>
in contact with the fluid, when the atomiser is in use, so that when an<br>
appropriate potential is applied to said electrodes, fluid particles are charged;<br>
characterised by the fact that at least one of the said electrode presents a fluid<br>
contacting region which comprises a closely contiguous array of non-fibrous<br>
conducting elements generally protruding from the electrode so as to form an<br>
array of individual electrode points where the field generated by the atomiser<br>
is concentrated.<br>
This configuration is advantageous because it removes the complex<br>
requirements of having to precisely align the electrode tip with a particular<br>
orifice. Furthermore, a multi-orifice atomiser may in this configuration be<br>
produced with a relatively high radius tip instead of the prior art system where<br>
the electrode tip terminates in a sharp point or a sharp perimeter edge in the<br>
case of the bell shaped tip. This configuration will also achieve an<br>
advantageously even atomised spray from its orifices. Its manufacturing will<br>
also be simplified as compared to the previously discussed prior art systems.<br>
In a second broad independent aspect, the invention covers an electrostatic<br>
atomiser, comprising a channel through which, in use, a fluid passes; one or<br>
more orifices to allow the fluid to exit the atomiser; and at least two electrodes<br>
in contact with the fluid, when the atomiser is in use, so that when an<br>
appropriate potential is applied to said electrodes, fluid particles are charged;<br>
characterised by the fact that at least one of said electrodes presents a fluid<br>
contacting region which comprises one or more faceted conducting elements.<br>
Similar advantages to those listed with regard to the first broad independent<br>
aspect apply to the second broad independent aspect above. These advantages<br>
are also present even when the atomiser only comprises a single faceted<br>
conducting element Faceted conducting elements have the additional benefits<br>
of being generally particularly hard wearing and therefore particularly<br>
advantageous in atomising high frequency injected fluids and also particularly<br>
when applied in systems where the atomisation is followed by an explosion of<br>
the atomised fluid.<br>
In a third broad independent aspect, an electrostatic atomiser, comprises a<br>
channel through which, in use, a fluid passes; one or more orifices to allow the<br>
fluid to exit the atomiser; and at least two electrodes in contact with the fluid,<br>
for charging fluid particles when the atomiser is in use, wherein the or each<br>
orifice is part of an electrode to which a high potential is applied in use and<br>
said electrode presents a fluid contacting region which comprises a closely<br>
contiguous array of conducting elements generally protruding from the<br>
electrode so as to form an array of individual electrode points where the field<br>
generated by the atomiser is concentrated.<br>
This configuration marks a radical departure from the prior art thinking that<br>
the electrode surface at the orifice is to be preferably smooth. This aspect<br>
teaches literally the opposite. It also considers applying the high potential to<br>
the orifice electrode. By so doing, many of the prior art constraints are lifted.<br>
Particular advantages of this configuration are presented in Figure 2, where<br>
strict compliance to a given range of electrode gap as was the requirement of<br>
systems according to figure 1, is no longer a requirement. The percentage of<br>
potential charge retained in the discharge fluid is high almost irrespective of<br>
the electrode gap. Atomisation is therefore improved and achievable over a<br>
larger range of geometries as compared to the prior art systems.<br>
Furthermore, the advantages disclosed with reference to the first and second<br>
broad independent aspect are also present in this configuration.<br>
In a fourth broad independent aspect, an electrostatic atomiser, comprising a<br>
channel through which, in use, a fluid passes; one or more orifices to allow the<br>
fluid to exit the atomiser; and at least two electrodes in contact with the fluid<br>
for charging fluid particles when the atomiser is in use, wherein the or each<br>
orifice is part cf an electrode to which a high potential is applied in use and<br>
said electrode presents a fluid contacting region which comprises one or more<br>
faceted conducting elements.<br>
Similar advantages are present in this configuration as those presented in the<br>
context of the previous broad independent aspects. The specific advantages of<br>
the third broad independent aspect are also present when a single faceted<br>
conducting element is located in the fluid contacting region of an orifice.<br>
In a subsidiary aspect in accordance with any of the preceding broad<br>
independent aspects, the elements are diamond compounds or are carbon<br>
based compounds having similar properties to diamond. Utilising diamonds<br>
or the like compounds is particularly advantageous because of the combination<br>
of properties of diamond compounds - particularly when considering their<br>
toughness, electrical conductivity and ability of being retained by the electrode<br>
itself.<br>
In a further subsidiary aspect, the elements form part of a diamond coating. A<br>
diamond coating is particularly advantageous as it may readily be applied to a<br>
wide variety of electrode geometries and is particularly well suited to high<br>
volume production.<br>
In a further subsidiary aspect, the elements are fullerene molecules. These<br>
often have an icosahedral or a so-called "soccer ball" configuration constituted<br>
of an even-numbered clusters of Cin species with m&gt;40. This configuration<br>
has a surprisingly advantageous effect on atomisation despite its relative<br>
smoothness when compared to diamond crystals.<br>
In a further subsidiary aspect, the elements are carbon 64 compounds. This<br>
additional feature is particularly advantageous as its application achieves<br>
improved atomisation and renders the system flexible and suitable for high<br>
volume production."<br>
In a further subsidiary aspect, the size of one or more elements is under 500<br>
microns. Below this size, the atomiser configuration becomes advantageously<br>
flexible doing away with the prior art stringent tolerance requirements and<br>
restrictions as to the electrode"s geometry.<br>
Advantageously, the size of one or more elements may be comprised within<br>
the range of 10 to 150 microns. At these levels, flexibility is even further<br>
improved while maintaining advantageous atomisation properties. The cost of<br>
manufacturing atomisers within this range is also particularly beneficial.<br>
In a further subsidiary aspect, a first electrode incorporates an array of said<br>
orifices and a second electrode is spaced from said first electrode to permit the<br>
passage of fluid between them, the fluid contacting surface of said second<br>
electrode incorporating an array of said elements located essentially over said<br>
array of orifices. One of the advantages of this particular configuration is that<br>
atomisation is further improved by being particularly well balanced between<br>
the atomiser"s various orifices.<br>
Advantageously, the second electrode"s surface provided over the or each<br>
section located between orifices may be deprived of said elements. Adapting<br>
the atomiser in this manner reduces the amount of elements necessary to<br>
achieve improved atomisation and is equally susceptible of being produced in<br>
high volumes.<br>
In a further subsidiary aspect, a first electrode incorporates an array of said<br>
orifices and a second electrode is spaced from said first electrode to permit the<br>
passage of fluid between them, the first electrode incorporating in addition an<br>
array of elements.<br>
In this configuration, a higher concentration of electrical fields at the orifices may be<br>
achieved which would result in an improvement of the atomization properties.<br>
Advantageously, the or each orifice may be adapted to achieve an essential radial flow and<br>
the array of elements may take the form of a ring spaced from the or each orifice to permit<br>
the passage of fluid through the or each orifice and located essential over the or each orifice.<br>
The configuration is advantageous because as it may be able to wrap around an object while<br>
still improving the atomization of a fluid whilst doing away with the constraints of the prior<br>
art, particularly as to concentricity tolerances evident when using bell shaped electrode tips.<br>

Detailed Description of the Figures<br>
Figure 1 and figure 2 are discussed in detail in the context of the previous<br>
sections.<br>
Figure 3 shows an electrostatic atomiser generally referenced 1. The atomiser<br>
operates in conjunction with a fluid supply system 2 which conducts fluid into<br>
the atomiser first through a fluid passage 3 annular and essentially concentric<br>
with the longitudinal axis of the atomiser. Fluid passage 3 is formed between<br>
wall 4 and insulator 5. The insulator wraps about the outer surface of a central<br>
electrode 6 so as to electrically isolate the fluid in passage 3 from the central<br>
electrode 6.<br>
After the fluid passage 3, the fluid enters an atomisation chamber 7.<br>
In the lower region of wall 4, there is provided an array of orifices such as that<br>
referenced 8.<br>
A high voltage power source 9 is connected to both central electrode 6 and<br>
wall 4. Power source 9 is not intended in any way to be limited to any<br>
particular configuration and may for example be a direct current (DC) or even<br>
an alternative current (AC) power source. The person skilled in the art will<br>
naturally select an appropriate potential to be applied and any beneficial time<br>
dependencies, if necessary, from known alternatives. It is also envisaged<br>
within the scope of the invention that the electrodes with which the power<br>
source is to operate may be either positive or negative electrodes. Any such<br>
modification will undoubtedly be self-evident to the skilled addressee of this<br>
application and are therefore not detailed any further for the purposes of this<br>
description.<br>
The central electrode 6 has the characteristic of terminating in a high radius<br>
curve covered by a diamond coating 10 covering the entire fluid contacting<br>
surface of the electrode.<br>
The diamond costing 10 is constituted of diamond elements of say 10 microns<br>
such as that referenced 11 which protrudes from the electrode so as to form an<br>
electrode point 12. At this element size, the manufacturing process involved<br>
in coating may be a mechanical adhesion process whereby a fixer shown as<br>
layer 13 in the figure is first applied onto the surface of the electrode followed<br>
by the deposition of the array of elements 11. The person skilled in the art<br>
may also coat the electrode by other known processes such as plasma or gas<br>
deposition. The plasma deposition process will be particularly envisaged for<br>
element depositions in the nano-scale.<br>
Alternatively, elements 11 may be replace by carbon 64 compounds such as<br>
that referenced 14 in the figure. Element 14 may be of general spherical shape<br>
and protrudes from the electrode so as to form individual electrode points<br>
which achieve the advantageous field concentration required for improved<br>
atomisation.<br>
The invention also envisages the use of a so-called "diamond like" coating.<br>
This may be a carbon based compound having similar properties (for example<br>
hardness) to diamond.<br>
The invention also envisages that the elements of the same material as the<br>
electrode itself by for example etching away specific sections of the<br>
electrode"s surface so that elements are formed which protrude from the<br>
electrode and are part of an array of individual electrode points to concentrate<br>
the field generated by the atomiser.<br>
Figure 4 represents an electrostatic atomiser where identical components to<br>
those used in Figure 2 are given the same numerical reference followed by a<br>
prime sign. A distinctive feature of this embodiment is the incorporation of a<br>
diamond coating 15 on the inner surface of wall 4". In addition, a high<br>
potential is intended to be applied to wall electrode 4" by power source 9"<br>
whilst the central electrode may be grounded. While a diamond coating 15 is a<br>
preferred configuration of atomiser 1", it may be in fact also constituted of<br>
fibrous conductive material selected by the person skilled in the art to generate<br>
a concentration of potential charge which would be transmitted to fluid<br>
particles as they exit the atomiser. In the context of this application fluid<br>
particles naturally extend to any parts or elements of a fluid including the<br>
actual molecules or atoms of said fluid.<br>
In this configuration atomisation occurs particularly evenly through each<br>
orifice. One of the results of this configuration is shown as previously<br>
discussed in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further embodiment of an atomiser generally referenced 16<br>
with a central electrode 17, an insulator 18 and a wall 19. Central electrode 17<br>
has the particularity of terminating in a conical tip 20 incorporating an array of<br>
elements disposed in a coating of diamond 21.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further atomiser generally referenced 22 with a power source<br>
23 applying a difference in potential between a central electrode 24 and a wall<br>
electrode 25 in order to charge fluid particles travelling between them. Three<br>
orifices such as that referenced 26 are represented in the figure. A region of<br>
elements in for example a diamond coating are located directly over orifice 26<br>
and is referenced 27. A second region 28 is located directly over orifice 29<br>
whilst a third region 30 is located directly over orifice 31. The portions<br>
located directly over the sections located between the orifices such as that<br>
referenced 32 are deprived of elements. This configuration achieves enhanced<br>
atomisation while at the same "time reducing the amount of elements required<br>
to achieve this kind of multi-orifice atomisation.<br>
Figure 7 represents an atomiser 33 with a central electrode 34 and a wall<br>
electrode 35 provided with orifice 36 capable of achieving essentially radial<br>
flow. Around the lower region of central electrode 34, there is provided a ring<br>
37 of elements which allows the field generated by the atomiser to be evenly<br>
concentrated in any radial direction.<br>
Figure 8 shows a further atomiser 38 with a fluid supply system 39 and a<br>
power source 40. Power source 40 applies a relatively high voltage on outer<br>
electrode 41 whilst a low potential is applied to central electrode 42. The<br>
outer electrode 41 incorporates a number of orifices respectively referenced<br>
43, 44 and 45. On the inner surface of outer electrode 41, there are provided<br>
portions of elements 46, 47 and 48. Each of these portions of elements forms<br>
a ring around the inlet of the various orifices. The inner surface of outer<br>
electrode 41 between these portions is deprived of any such elements.<br>
Figure 9 represents an atomiser 49 which incorporates three electrodes 50, 51<br>
and 52. An electrical insulator 53 may be provided between electrodes 50 and<br>
51. Such a configuration may be electrically connected in a variety of modes.<br>
One of the modes of electrical connection would be to ground electrode 52<br>
whilst a very high potential (eg. 30 to 40 kV) is applied to electrode 50 and a<br>
high potential (eg. 6 to 10 kV) is applied to electrode 51. Another mode of<br>
connection would be to supply a very high potential of for example 30 to 40<br>
kV to the outer electrode 52, whilst a high potential of 6 to 10 kV is applied to<br>
electrode 51 and electrode 50 is grounded. A further mode of operation would<br>
be to apply a high potential to electrode 52 whilst electrodes 50 and 51 are<br>
grounded. In this embodiment, element portion 54 is located adjacent to<br>
orifice 55. It is envisaged within the scope if the invention mat element<br>
portions such as that referenced 54 may be used at any appropriate location in<br>
the atomiser"s exit path.<br>
