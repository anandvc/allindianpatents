				<td>A Time-Temperature Integrating (TTI)<br>
Indicator And Method Of Manufacture Thereof<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a a time-temperature integrating (TTI) indicator and<br>
a method of manufacture thereof. The invention relates to time-temperature<br>
integrating indicators, also known as TTI indicators, which are easily printable on<br>
substrates, such as packaging materials, and to a method for the manufacture of<br>
packaging materials comprising printed TTI indicators. The printed TTI indicator is<br>
selectively activated at the time of packaging of a perishable product or alternatively<br>
at the time of opening of the package of a perishable product.<br>
State of the art<br>
Colour-changing or colour-forming temperature sensitive indicators for monitoring<br>
of handling of perishable goods are well known in the art. Such perishable goods are<br>
for example foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, biological materials, chemical substances,<br>
coating compositions, adhesives, cosmetics, food additives, photographic supplies<br>
and vaccines. There is a growing interest for indicator systems and devices for<br>
monitoring a temperature and a time as an accumulated value of articles, which are<br>
stored at a constant temperature for a certain period of time. Particularly such<br>
indicator systems are used for signalling when the articles have reached the point of<br>
quality loss or unsafe condition due to excessive temperature exposures.<br>
Several time-temperature integrating indicator systems and devices have been<br>
proposed. Usually they are either attached as adhesive labels to the surface of<br>
consumer packages of perishable goods or incorporated onto the packages at the<br>
time of production of the goods to show when a package has been temperature<br>
abused or has reached the end of its useful shelf life. Most of the TTIs available are<br>
colourimetic labels, which respond to cumulative exposure to time and temperature.<br><br>
TTIs typically provide a visual indicator that gradually changes with time faster at<br>
elevated temperatures and slower at colder temperatures. Commercially available<br>
are products, which employ enzymatic colour indicators to show the amount of<br>
higher temperature exposure of a stored or shipped temperature-sensitive com-<br>
modity. The enzyme indicator is activated at the beginning of a monitoring period<br>
by applying pressure on a plastic bubble strip thus releasing the enzyme, substrate<br>
and indicator to react with each other. Another indicator system is based on a po-<br>
lymerisation reaction and the system must be stored frozen prior to usage. Also a<br>
product based on a dyed wax that diffuses along a strip of paper is known.<br>
An improved indicator system utilising the concept of two different indicator<br>
technologies is disclosed in F.P 0 484 578. This indicator device comnrises a svs-<br>
tem of printable multi-layer compatible composition with an independently acting<br>
integrating indicator and another threshold indicator. In a preferable embodiment,<br>
diacetylenic monomers are printed on a transparent film as the primary indicia of<br>
long-term storage. As a function of time and temperature, the material gradually<br>
and irreversibly develops colour. The secondary indicator is set to trigger at a pre-<br>
determined temperature very rapidly. The combined indicator device yields a sin-<br>
gle output.<br>
US 5,756,356 discloses an indicator material and a method of indicating a time or<br>
a temperature time accumulated value as a colour change which comprises provid-<br>
ing an oxidation-polymerizable dyestuff (agent A) and oxidising agent (agent B)<br>
in a non-contact state and the agent A and/or the agent B being held in a carrier<br>
which may be a resin or liquid media. When activation takes place, A and B are<br>
brought into contact with each other. In said indicator material, between a first .<br>
layer containing agent A in a carrier and a second layer containing agent B in a<br>
carrier, there is a third layer so-called spacing layer which may include woven<br>
fabric, non-woven fabric, powder and micro-capsules. The indicator material may<br>
be obtained by a printing method using as a carrier a source marking ink, such as<br>
gravure ink, offset ink, screen ink, a lithographic ink or flexographic ink, or by a<br><br>
printing method using an on-demand ink, such as stamp ink, carbon-free paper<br>
ink, inkjet ink, wire dot ink, typewriter ink or thermal ink. A layer containing the<br>
agent B may be directly formed on the surface of a tape-shaped layer containing<br>
the agent A by printing method just before initiation of the measurement of the<br>
temperature time accumulated value. A layer containing the agent A may be<br>
formed on a transparent substrate by a printing method and the resultant laminate<br>
may be attached to a surface over tape-shaped layer containing the agent A just<br>
before the initiation and a measurement of a temperature-time accumulated value.<br>
A layer containing the agent A and a layer containing the agent B may be formed<br>
on a transparent film by any one of a silk screen printing method, a gravure print-<br>
ing method and an offset printing method. However, control of the reaction rate of<br>
an oxidation reaction may cause difficulties and the colour change may not be<br>
sufficiently fast.<br>
A recording material is provided in EP 1048477, which material is suitable for use<br>
in a direct thermal imaging apparatus and which contains at least one indicator<br>
compound that is convertible from an inactive state to an active state by the appli-<br>
cation of heat with a direct thermal imaging apparatus. The recording material<br>
refers to any substrate that is suitable for use in a thermal imaging apparatus and it<br>
may take the form of an article or product packaging such as a cardboard con-<br>
tainer or a label. Substrates may include all types of paper, both thermal paper and<br>
non-thermal paper or adhesive labels. Preferred indicator compounds are kinetic<br>
indicator compounds, which provide a change in colour from a chemical reaction<br>
in response to the exposure element of interest such as integrated time and tem-<br>
perature. It may be convenient to apply the indicator composition in the form of a<br>
printed message on the recording material or alternatively, the layer of the indica-<br>
tor compound on the recording material can be activated in the form of a printed<br>
message. This method requires always the use of a thermal imaging apparatus.<br>
WO 01/64430 discloses an indicator system, winch is attached to a unit of ther-<br>
mally sensitive perishable product and is activated at a time of introduction of the<br><br>
unit into commerce to initiate the monitoring of the unit's cumulative exposure to<br>
harmful temperatures. Said indicator system comprises use of a direct self-<br>
adhesive thermal label paper comprising a colour-forming high-temperature print-<br>
ing composition, and a second activating element component in the form of a self-<br>
adhesive tab or label comprising a substrate, an adhesive composition and an acti-<br>
vating component that, when applied to the direct thermal coating, combines with<br>
the primary composition to enable its colour-forming reaction. The application of<br>
the second element may also be performed directly in fluid form using clear ink<br>
comprising an activating component.<br>
An indicator device for use in steam sterilization is disclosed in US 4,410,493.<br>
Said device consists of a permeable wick material which is treated with a suitable<br>
indicator chemical such as sebacic acid, to provide an indication like colour<br>
change when exposed to certain constituents in an environment. The wick is<br>
sealed between two layers of an impermeable material and the device may contain<br>
a backing material of polymeric material or metal foil.<br>
Several activatable time-temperature indicator systems have been proposed. Most<br>
of the systems involve a complicated indicator system or a label which is to be<br>
affixed to a perishable product and often co-reactant components are in close<br>
proximity but yet maintaining reactive isolation by means of additional interven-<br>
ing layers, encapsulating films and the like. Such TTI systems and devices are<br>
often costly to manufacture, complicated to activate and they are prone to inadver-<br>
tent premature activation. Additionally, adhesive labels tend to be released from<br>
the articles. Based on the above it can be realised that there exists a need for a low<br>
cost and reliable time-temperature indicator, which is directly printable on the<br>
packaging material, which can be cost effectively manufactured and easily acti-<br>
vated and no affixing of labels or use of any additional equipment is required.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention is a TTI indicator, which can be directly printed<br>
on a substrate material and which can be activated at a desired moment by print-<br>
ing, or alternatively a TTI indicator, which can be printed between layers of a sub-<br>
strate material, and which can be activated at a desired moment by opening of a<br>
package containing the indicator. Said TTI indicator provides a rapid and clear<br>
indication of expiration.<br>
A further object of the invention is a method for the manufacture of TTI indicator,<br>
which can be directly printed on a substrate material and which can be activated at<br>
a desired moment by printing, or alternatively a TTI indicator, which can be<br>
printed between layers of a substrate material, and which can be activated at a<br>
desired moment by opening of a package containing the indicator, and which in-<br>
dicator provides a rapid and clear indication of expiration.<br>
A further object of the invention is a method for the monitoring a temperature and<br>
a time as an accumulated value of a perishable product with the TTI indicator ac-<br>
cording to the invention, either from the time of packaging of the perishable prod-<br>
uct or in the alternative embodiment, from the time of opening of the package of<br>
the perishable product.<br>
The characteristic features of the printed TTI indicator, of the method for the<br>
manufacture of a printed TTI indicator and of the method for the monitoring a<br>
temperature and a time as an accumulated value of a perishable product with the<br>
TTI indicator according to the invention are provided in the claims.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has now been realised that a TTI indicator can be easily manufactured directly<br>
on a substrate in connection with printing of the substrate, and suitably at the time<br><br>
of packaging of the final product, which is to be monitored. Thus the time of<br>
printing is the time of activation.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the TO may be printed between layers of a substrate<br>
material. At the time of packaging of the final product or at the time of the manu-<br>
facture of the packaging material/substrate the TTI indicator may be printed on<br>
the inner side of the packaging material and it is then sealed between packaging<br>
material/substrate layers. The TTI is activated at a desired moment by opening of<br>
a package, containing the indicator, of the perishable product.<br>
The TTI indicator according to the invention comprises a substrate, an optional<br>
protective layer on the substrate, a diffusion layer, agent A and agent B on the<br>
substrate or on the protective layer or on the diffusion layer, and an optional outer<br>
protective layer. In the first embodiment agent A and agent B are adjacent to each<br>
other but not in direct contact with each other. In the alternative embodiment<br>
agent A and agent B are in direct contact with each other and either adjacent to<br>
each other, on the top of each other or blended together.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has been noted that many of the problems and disadvantages related to the solu-<br>
tions according to the prior art can be avoided or at least substantially decreased<br>
by the TTI according to the invention. A TTI indicator can be easily manufactured<br>
directly on a substrate in connection with printing of the substrate, and suitably at<br>
the time of packaging of the final product, which is to be monitored. The time of<br>
printing of the TTI indicator is the time of activation of the TTI indicator.<br>
In the alternative embodiment the TTI may be printed between layers of a sub-<br>
sttate material. At the time of packaging of the final product or at the lime of the<br>
manufacture of the packaging material/substrate the TTI indicator may suitably be<br>
printed on the inner side of the packaging material and it is then sealed between<br><br>
packaging material/substrate layers. The TTI is activated at a desired moment by<br>
opening of a package, containing the indicator, of the perishable product.<br>
The TTI indicator according to the first embodiment of the invention comprises a<br>
substrate, an optional protective layer on the substrate, a diffusion layer, at least one<br>
stripe or dot or a geometrical figure comprising agent A and at least one stripe or dot<br>
or a geometrical figure comprising agent B, adjacent to each other but not in direct<br>
contact with each other, on the substrate or on the protective layer or on the diffusion<br>
layer, and an optional outer protective layer.<br>
The TTI indicator according to the alternative embodiment of the invention<br>
comprises a substrate, an optional protective layer on the substrate, a diffusion layer,<br>
at least one stripe or dot or a geometrical figure comprising agent A and at least one<br>
stripe or dot or a geometrical figure comprising agent B, in direct contact with each<br>
other and either adjacent to each other, on the top of each other or blended together,<br>
on the substrate or on the protective layer or on the diffusion layer, and an optional<br>
outer protective layer and an outer substrate layer.<br>
The invention is illustrated in more detail with enclosed figures 1 - 3 of the<br>
accompanyign drawings:<br>

In figure 1 a TTI indicator according to the invention is presented. Agents A and<br>
B are printed on a substrate D (which is optionally coated with a protective layer)<br>
as stripes, dots or geometrical figures, adjacent to each other but not in direct con-<br>
tact with each other. On the agents A and B a diffusion layer C is printed, which<br>
may optionally be coated with a protective layer.<br>
In figure 2 a TTI indicator according to the alternative embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion is presented. Agents A and B are printed on a inner substrate layer D1 (which<br>
is optionally coated with a protective layer) as stripes, dots or geometrical figures,<br>
on top of each and in direct contact with each other. On the agents A and B a dif-<br>
fusion layer C is printed, which may optionally be coated with a protective layer.<br>
The indicator is covered the outer substrate layer D2 (which is optionally coated<br>
with a protective layer), which may comprise same or different material as the<br>
inner substrate layer D1.<br>
In figure 3 another TTI indicator according to the alternative embodiment of the<br>
invention is presented. A blend of agents A and B is printed on a inner substrate<br>
layer D1 (which is optionally coated with a protective layer) as stripes, dots or<br>
geometrical figures. On the blended agents A and B a diffusion layer C is printed,<br>
which may optionally be coated with a protective layer. The indicator is covered<br>
the outer substrate layer D2 (which is optionally coated with a protective layer),<br>
which may comprise same or different material as the inner substrate layer D1.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, on the substrate or optionally on<br>
the protective layer, which is situated on the substrate, a diffusion layer is applied,<br>
suitably by offset, inkjet, flexo, silkscreen, gravure, folio or spray printing and a<br>
particularly suitable printing method is a digitally controlled printing inkjet<br>
method. The substrate containing the diffusion layer and optional protective layer<br>
may then be stored in a warehouse etc until the final product is packed in it. In the<br>
first embodiment, in connection with the manufacture of the final package con-<br>
taining the product the agents A and B and the optional outer protective layer are<br><br>
applied by printing on the diffusion layer and the activation of the indicator takes<br>
place.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the agents A and B, the diffu-<br>
sion layer and optionally the protective layer(s) are all applied by printing on the<br>
substrate or on the protective layer in connection with the manufacture of the final<br>
package containing the product and the activation of the indicator takes place. A<br>
suitable printing method is offset, inkjet, flexo, silkscreen, gravure, folio or spray<br>
printing, preferably inkjet, and particularly preferably a digitally controlled inkjet<br>
printing method is used.<br>
In the first embodiment the activation of the TTI indicator is performed by print-<br>
ing agent A and agent B in connection with packaging of goods to be monitored.<br>
Agents A and B may be printed in the form stripes or dots or geometrical figures,<br>
and the like. All conventional graphics, including barcodes, required for the indi-<br>
cator may be printed simultaneously.<br>
In the alternative embodiment the TTI indicator is printed between the packaging<br>
material/substrate layers and it is activated by opening the package, particularly<br>
by tearing the packaging material containing the TTI indicator between the pack-<br>
aging material and thus revealing the indicator and exposing it to the surrounding<br>
atmosphere. The agent B is preferable an easily evaporating organic acid in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
In another embodiment a combination of TTI indicator and an additional tempera-<br>
ture indicator is printed on the substrate/packaging.<br>
The substrate is selected from packaging material, which may comprise paper,<br>
cardboard, plastic foil, metal or glass, preferably paper, cardboard or plastic foil.<br><br>
The substrate may optionally comprise a protective layer, which is any transparent<br>
material with good water vapour barrier properties. Suitable ones are polyolefins<br>
as well as aqueous and solvent containing laquers. Preferably polyethylene, poly-<br>
propylene and acrylic based lacquers are used. The protective layer is applied onto<br>
the substrate by a suitable coating or printing method known to a man skilled in<br>
the art, such as spray coating, laminating or offset, inkjet, fiexo, silkscreen, gra-<br>
vure, folio or spray printing, a preferable printing method is a digitally controlled<br>
inkjet printing method. The protective layer may also be applied on the TTI as an<br>
outer protective layer to prevent agents A and B from drying.<br>
The diffusion layer is a membrane comprising film-forming substances selected<br>
from cellulose derivatives such as carboxy methyl cellulose, micro-crystalline<br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, starches, com protein<br>
(Zein protein), soy protein, casein, glutein, cyclodextrins, cithosan, lecithin and<br>
phospholipide, hydro-gels and sol-gels, gum arabic, agarose and resins, dissolved<br>
in a solvent or mixture of solvents. Suitable solvents are water, alcohols such as<br>
ethanol and glycols, such as polyethylene glycol.<br>
Also additives selected from lauric acid, cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol, beeswax<br>
and acetylated monoglyseride may be used for adjusting the diffusion rate in the<br>
diffusion layer.<br>
The thickness and density of the diffusion layer can be varied depending of the<br>
desired diffusion rate, which corresponds to the maximum time factor.<br>
The indicator comprises agent A and agent B which, when brought into contact<br>
with each other react and yield a by visual light and/or UV-light detectable change<br>
of colour. In the alternative embodiment the agent A and agent B are in direct<br>
contact with each other at the time of activation and the original colour of agent A<br>
returns when agent B is evaporated from the layer or mixture. This change of col-<br>
our is equally detectable by visual light and/or UV-light.<br><br><br>
Agent A is a pH-indicator also called a pH-dyc. The pH-indicator is preferably<br>
selected from the group consisting of methyl red, cresol red, bromthymol blue,<br>
neutral red, phenol phthalein, bromocresol red, bromocresol green, bromocresol<br>
blue, xylenol blue, thymol blue, methyl orange, lithmus and thymol phthalein,<br>
particularly preferably bromocresol blue. Agent A may also contain a solvent,<br>
suitably water or alcohol, such as ethanol or a mixture thereof, and /or a humec-<br>
tant, suitably a glycol, such as polyethylene glycol, to prevent drying of the com-<br>
position on the print head during printing operation.<br>
Agent B is a material with adjusted pH, preferably an organic acid selected from<br>
citnc acid tartaric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid or formic acid, preferably citric<br>
acid. A, sent B may also contain a solvent, suitably water or alcohol, such as etha-<br>
nol or a mixture thereof, and /or a humectant, suitably a glycol, such as polyethyl-<br>
ene glycol, to prevent drying of the composition on the print head during printing<br>
operation.<br><br>
Thus the TTI indicator according to the first embodiment is activated at the time<br>
of packaging of the articles in the substrate material having optionally the printed<br>
diffusion layer on its' surface or on the protective layer, by applying by printing<br>
the agents A and B. A suitable printing method is inkjet, offset, flexo, silkscreen,<br>
gravure, folio or spray printing, preferably inkjet.<br>
Agent A and agent B are preferably incorporated in a carrier, suitably in a printing<br>
ink composition. A printing ink composition comprises:<br>
10 - 20 wt-% of agent A or of agent B, or a blend thereof in the al-<br>
ternative embodiment;<br>
50 - 70 wt-% of a water-miscible or water soluble solvent, such as<br>
an alcohol like ethanol, toluene, xylene, or mixtures thereof;<br>
binder selected from oils, resins, nitrocellulose, polyamides and<br>
acrylates; and<br>
additive or combination of additives selected from plasticizers,<br>
waxes, anti-foam substances, antioxidants, humectants and fillers.<br>
The printing ink composition has low viscosity, it dries rapidly and it is non-<br>
tixotropic.<br>
According to the first embodiment of the invention one or more stripes or dots or<br>
geometrical figures comprising agents A and B may be printed on the substrate<br>
and the distance between the A and B stripes or dots or figures can adjusted io<br>
achieve the reaction at a desired point of time. Agent A and agent B migrate in the<br>
diffusion layer towards each other. The reaction between agent A and agent B<br>
takes place at a predetermined moment of time and it provides a rapid and clear<br>
indication of expiration. The diffusion can also be influenced by the selection of a<br>
suitable pH-indicator (ph-dye) and material with adjusted pH, such as an organic<br>
acid. Suitable printing methods are inkjet, offset, flexo, silkscreen, gravure, folio<br>
or spray printing, preferably digitally controllable inkjet printing methods.<br><br>
The properties of the TO indicator may be adjusted by a choice of the reactive<br>
components A and B and also by the amount of the compounds used. The<br>
amounts may easily be adjusted by changing the gravure figures in printing, the<br>
cell size, and the viscosity or dry/solid content of the printing ink.<br>
Because the printing may be carried out just before or at the time of packaging of<br>
the product, this makes it possible to rapidly and specificly for each product to<br>
change the time-temperature sensitivity.<br>
The present invention comprises a TTI indicator which is printed on a substrate<br>
such as cardboard or paper, useful as packaging material for perishable goods and<br>
activated by printing the indicator at the time of packaging and releasing of the<br>
goods on the market. Said printed indicator is useful for monitoring the exposure<br>
of a perishable foodstuff or a commodity product to a critical condition of such<br>
time and temperature which will result in spoilage or unacceptable degradation of<br>
the quality of the perishable product.<br>
In the alternative embodiment the TTI indicator is printed between the packaging<br>
material/substrate layers and it is activated by opening the package, particularly<br>
by tearing the packaging material containing the TTI indicator between the pack-<br>
aging material and thus revealing the indicator and exposing it to the surrounding<br>
atmosphere. This embodiment is particularly suitable for monitoring of the time<br>
and temperature, which will result in spoilage or unacceptable degradation of the<br>
quality of a perishable product after opening of the package. The easily evaporat-<br>
ing agent B is released from the TTI indicator, resulting in a change of colour.<br>
Perishable products include foodstuffs such as meat, fish, poultry, plants and the<br>
like, food additives, biological materials, drugs, cosmetics, photographic supplies,<br>
coating compositions, adhesives, vaccines, implantation related organs and<br>
chemical substances.<br><br>
Visible light or humidity in the surroundings has no effect on the reaction between<br>
agents A and B.<br>
The parameters and the sensitivity of the reaction can be easily adjusted, even<br>
during the manufacturing process. The content of the printed information can be<br>
changed in-line during the printing process. The process according to the inven-<br>
tion allows the production of TTI indicators, which perform in a controlled and<br>
reliable manner and which provide a rapid and clear indication of expiration.<br>
The present invention provides a cost effective printed TTI indicator on a sub-<br>
strate or between the substrate, it is easy to use, environmentally acceptable as the<br>
indicator is printed directly on substrate, it is not much labour consuming as no<br>
affixing of labels is needed. Further, as different products have different tempera-<br>
ture/time limits and expiration times and earlier several different types of indica-<br>
tor labels were needed, the present invention provides a method which yields in-<br>
dicators for different products by adjusting in-line the amounts of each compo-<br>
nent, the distances of stripes or dots or figures of agents A and B, by using a digi-<br>
tally controllable printing method for the printing of the ingredients of the indica-<br>
tor. The components are also suitable for the use in food products.<br><br>
