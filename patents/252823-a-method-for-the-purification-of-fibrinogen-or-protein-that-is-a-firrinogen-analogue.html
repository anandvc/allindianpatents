				<td>AFFINITY ADSORBENTS FOR FIBRINOGEN Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to compounds and their use as affinity ligands. Background to the Invention<br>
Fibrinogen is a dimeric protein, each half of which is composed of disulfide-bonded polypeptide chains designated Aa, B(3 and Y- In the liver, the genes for the Aa- and Bp-chains encode single products of 610 and 461 amino acid residues, respectively. In contrast, alternative splicing of transcripts of the Y-chain gene yield Y-chain variants of slightly different lengths (411 and 427 residues), the shorter of which constitutes -90% of the final product. The predominant form of fibrinogen is secreted into the circulation with a molecular mass of -340 kDa. Following its secretion from the liver, the protein exists not only in plasma, but also in lymph and interstitial fluid. In healthy individual the concentration of fibrinogen in plasma is between 4 and 10 uM. Importantly, that concentration can increase by as much as much as 400% during times of physiological stress.<br>
Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin, a trypsin-Hke serine proteinase. Thrombin hydrolyzes at least two specific Arg-Gly bonds within fibrinogen. This process leads initially to the formation of fibrin protofibrils which can associate laterally, forming thicker fibres that, in turn, can associate to form even thicker and branched fibrin bundles. Such bundles are further stabilised by cross-links formed between Lys and Gin residues located within the a-chains of neighboring fibrin molecules, to form a 3-D meshwork capable of preventing or limiting blood flow. This process of cross-linking is catalysed by the enzyme Factor XII la.<br>
Two types of congenital abnormalities of fibrinogen exist, afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia. Afibrinogenemia is a quantitative deficiency that results in bleeding diatheses. The term hypofibrinogenemia refers to a less severe fibrinogen deficiency. Dysfibrinogenemia is marked by functional abnormalities of fibrinogen that may result in either bleeding or thrombosis. Patients may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. Fibrinogen is also commonly used during surgery as an adjunct to hemostasis in the form of fibrin sealants. These are typically two-component systems comprising fibrinogen (e.g. in the form of fibrinogen concentrate) and thrombin in appropriate pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
A concern in the administration of these partially purified forms of fibrinogen is the presence of contaminating proteins. An affinity-based purification method for the isolation of fibrinogen would therefore be useful. Such a purification method would be especially useful if it were able to isolate fibrinogen from non-depleted plasma, in<br><br>
a  specific  fashion,   leaving   all   other  protein   components   intact  for  further manipulation.<br>

The following Examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1 - Synthesis of 4-(4-morpholino)anilinyl dichlorotriazine<br>
Cyanuric chloride (16.1 g) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (130 mL) and cooled to 0°C in an ice/salt bath. 4-(4-Morpholino)aniline (29.61 g) in THF (400 mL) was added to the solution of cyanuric chloride at such a rate that the temperature did not exceed 0°C. After addition was complete, the mixture was stirred at 0°C for a further 30 minutes, before the solution was added to a mixture of ice (700 g) and water (1.5 L). The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with water (1 L), before being dried in a vacuum oven at 45°C to constant weight (28.54 g). Example 2 - Synthesis of Adsorbent III<br>
6% cross-linked Purabead agarose gel (1000 g settled in Reverse Osmosis (RO) water) was slurried with RO water (667 mL), 10 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (90 mL), and epichlorohydriri (127 mL). The slurry was stirred over 2 hours. After a sample was taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered, then washed with RO water (12 x 1 L). Analysis for epoxy groups showed that the gel was derivatised with 19.2 Mmol epoxy groups per g of settled gel.<br>
The gel was drained before RO water (400 mL) and 0.88 specific gravity aqueous ammonia solution (100 mL) were added. The mixture was stirred and heated to 40°C, then stirred at this temperature over 16 hours. After a sample was taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered, then washed with RO water (12 x 500 mL). TNBS analysis for amine groups showed that the gel was derivatised with 28.0 Mmol amine groups per g of settled gel.<br>
The settled, aminated gel (500 g) was suspended in 1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0 (500 mL), then allowed to drain. To this gel were then added 1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0 (125 mL) and RO water (125 mL). The slurry was stirred vigorously while acetone (250 mL) was added. After cooling in an ice/salt bath over 30 minutes, cyanuric chloride (12.5 g) in cold acetone (125 mL) was added in one portion. The mixture was stirred at 0°C over 1 hour, before being washed with 50% aqueous acetone (5 x 500 mL), RO water (5 x 500 mL), 50% aqueous acetone (5 x 500 mL), and RO water (10 x 500 mL). The gel was allowed to settle under gravity, before a sample was taken for analysis. Analysis for chloride release indicated that the gel was derivatised with 26.1 µmol substituted dichlorotriazine per g of settled gel.<br>
Settled gel from the previous stage (238 g) was slurried with RO water (138 mL) under ice/salt cooling, before 2-(4-morpholino)ethylamine (4.39 g) in cold

To 238 g (settled) of the gel was added agmatine sulfate (15.42 g) dissolved in RO water (200 mL - pH adjusted to pH 10, then made up to a final volume of 238 mL with RO water). The mixture was stirred at 60°C overnight, while maintaining the pH at 10. After a sample of the supernatant was taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered, then washed with RO water (l5x250mL). Analysis for chloride release indicated that the gel had been derivatised with 17.0 umol agmatine per g of settled gel.<br>
The gel was incubated in a final concentration of 0.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol overnight at 40°C, then washed with 0.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol (5 x 250 mL). After the final wash was allowed to drain under gravity, 0.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol (250 mL) was added and the mixture incubated at 40°C overnight.

The mixture was stirred at 60°C overnight, while maintaining the pH at 10. The slurry was filtered, then washed with RO water (15 x 150 mL). The gel was washed with RO water (10 x 150 mL), before storage in the cold room at 4°C in 20% v/v aqueous ethanol. Example 6 - Synthesis of Adsorbent VII<br>
6% cross-linked Purabead agarose gel (650 g settled in RO water) was slurried with RO water (438 mL), 10 M sodium hydroxide <naoh ml and epichlorohydrin the slurry was stirred over hours. after a sample></naoh>
taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered then washed with RO water (12 x 1 L). Analysis for epoxy groups showed that the gel was derivatised with 16.5 umol epoxy groups per g of settled gel.<br>
The gel was drained before RO water (520 mL) and 0.88 specific gravity ammonia solution (130 mL) were added. The mixture was stirred and heated to 40°C, then stirred at this temperature over 16 hours. After a sample was taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered then washed with RO water (12 x 1 L). TNBS analysis for amine groups showed that the gel was derivatised with 22.9 umol amine groups per g of settled gel.<br>
A 150 g portion of the settled, aminated gel was slurried with DMF (150 mL) then allowed to drain. This gel was then slurried with DMF (75 mL), and DIPEA (1.38 mL) added with stirring. The mixture was stirred over 10 minutes, then 4-(4-morpholino)anilinyl dichlorotriazine (2.58 g) in DMF (75 mL) added in one portion. The mixture was stirred at room temperature over 3 hours. After a sample was taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered then washed with 70% v/v aqueous DMF (4 x 150 mL), 50% v/v aqueous DMF (2 x 150 mL), and RO water (12 x 150 mL). Analysis for chloride release indicated that the gel was derivatised with 21.4 umol substituted monochlorotriazine per g of settled gel. Residual amine analysis indicated that 0.8 pmol amine groups per g of settled gel remained after derivatisation.<br>
A 132 g (settled) portion of the gel was slurried in 1 M sodium borate buffer (132 mL) and the pH adjusted to 10 with 10 M sodium hydroxide. Agmatine sulfate (3.73 g) was added in one portion. The mixture was stirred at 60°C overnight, while maintaining the pH at 10. After a sample of the supernatant was taken for analysis, the slurry was filtered, then washed with RO water (15 x 150 mL). Analysis for chloride release indicated that the gel had been derivatised with 19.9 µmol agmatine per g of settled gel.<br>
The gel was incubated in a final concentration of 0.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol overnight at 40°C, then washed with 0.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol (5 x 150 mL). After the final wash was allowed to drain under gravity, Q.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol (150 mL) was added and the mixture incubated at 40°C overnight. The gel was then washed with 0.5 M NaOH/25% v/v aqueous ethanol (5 x 150 mL), then RO water (10 x 150 mL). The gel was then incubated in a final concentration of 0.5 M NaOH overnight at 40°C, then washed with 0.5 M NaOH (5 x 150 mL). After the final wash was allowed to drain under gravity, 0.5 M NaOH (150 mL) was added and the mixture incubated at 40°C overnight. The gel was then washed with 0.5 M NaOH (5 x 150 mL), then RO water (10 x 150 mL). After washing<br>
with 0.1 M PBS pH 7.0 (3 x 150 mL), the gel was washed a further time with RO<br>
water (10 x 150 mL), before storage in the cold room at 4°C in 20% v/v aqueous<br>
ethanol.<br>
Example 7 - Chromatography on human plasma<br>
Chromatography experiments were performed with each of Adsorbents III, IV, V, VI, and VII, using a 1 cm diameter, 10 mL column volume omnifit column using a Biologic LP Chromatography system. The column was equilibrated with 5 column volumes of 13 mM sodium citrate, 140 mM sodium chloride pH 7.0 at 100 cm/hr. Human plasma (0.45 µm filtered, 100 mL) was then loaded at 50 cm/hr. Post-load wash was with 13 mM sodium citrate, 140 mM sodium chloride pH 7.0, to baseline absorbance. The column was then eluted with 0.3 M glycine, 0.5 M sodium chloride and 1% w/v sodium cholate pH 9.0, and sanitised with 2 M guanidine hydrochloride pH 7.0. The elution fraction was neutralised immediately with 0.4 M HCl prior to analysis. Load, non-bound, and elution fractions were analysed by nepheJometry to determine binding and elution capacities. SDS PAGE was carried out to determine purity.<br>
The purity of fibrinogen in each eluate was greater than 85%. Binding and elution capacities are presented in Table 1.<br>
