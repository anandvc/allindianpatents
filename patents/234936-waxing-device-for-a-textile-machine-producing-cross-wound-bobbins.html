3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Description:<br>
Waxing device for a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins<br>
The invention relates to a waxing device according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Waxing devices for textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins have been known for a long time and are described in numerous publications in the patent literature. Waxing devices of this type are used in winding machines, for example, in order to reduce the coefficient of friction of a yarn. In other words, while rewinding small-volume spinning cops to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins, such as takes place, for example, on automatic cross-winding machines, paraffin wax particles are applied to the yarn and improve the running and sliding properties of the yarn, which is of considerable importance, in particular in subsequent processing operations, for example when knitting.<br>
In order to achieve as uniform as possible wear of the paraffin wax body, the paraffin wax body is rotated slowly about its centre longitudinal axis in the known waxing devices, such as described, for example, in DE 32 28 642 Al or DE 195 39 099 Al, in which the running thread simultaneously lightly loads the end face of the paraffin wax body. In these known waxing devices, the paraffin wax body is mounted so as to be rotationally engaged, but axially displaceable on a drivable bearing shaft and is pressed by a spring element against adjustable path limitation means which specify the working position of the paraffin wax body. The adjustment of a certain working position of the paraffin wax body can thus fix the quantity of paraffin wax application on the yarn.<br>
A horizontally arranged stop rail can be used as an axial path limitation means, for example, as described in DE 32 28 642 Al, on which stop rail the paraffin wax body rests with parts of its end face and which can be pivoted upwardly for the insertion of a new paraffin wax body. The stop rail is displaceably mounted, in this case, in a<br>
2<br><br>
guide, parallel to the axis of rotation of the paraffin wax body, so various working positions can be adjusted.<br>
In the waxing device according to DE 195 39 099 Al, rollers are used as path limitation means, which, rolling laterally on the end face of the paraffin wax body, specify the respective working position of the paraffin wax body. The rollers are mounted, in this case, with their rotary pins mounted, in each case, in a holding sleeve, which is in turn supported eccentrically in a hole of a bearing housing. By adjusting the angular position of the holding sleeve in the hole of the bearing housing, the position of the path limitation rollers, and therefore the axial working position of the paraffin wax body, can be adjusted.<br>
Furthermore, waxing devices are known from EP 0 071 582 A, which in each case have a hook-like path limitation means adjustably mounted in an axial guide. The path limitation means of these waxing devices can be fixed in various working positions and in a position in which the paraffin wax body has no further contact with the thread.<br>
The known waxing devices, however, have the drawback that the paraffin wax body is relatively freely arranged in the installation position and therefore tends to soiling owing to fibre fly. Moreover, the known waxing devices, in particular when the path limitation device can also be fixed in a working position in which the paraffin wax body has no contact with the running thread, are also designed in a constructionally relatively expensive manner.<br>
Proceeding from the prior work cited above, the invention is based on the object of providing a waxing device, which has a paraffin wax body which is arranged in a protected manner and is simple and robust with respect to its design structure. The path limitation means are to be configured in this case such that the paraffin wax body can be fixed in various working positions and also, without having to remove<br>
3<br><br>
it in advance, in a position in which the paraffin wax body is out of contact with the yarn.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a waxing device as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The waxing device according to the invention has a pivoting flap, which covers the paraffin body during the winding process and which can be transferred from an operating position into a loading position to equip the waxing device with a new paraffin wax body.<br>
A plurality of path limitation means which can be adjusted in a defined manner in each case on a pivot pin with respect to their working position, and on which the paraffin wax body rests with its end face, are mounted on the pivoting flap, in this case. The path limitation means in turn have a plurality of respective stops of different heights defining a certain working position of the paraffin wax body, the highest of the stops positioning the paraffin wax body in a position in which the paraffin wax body is without contact with the running thread.<br>
As indicated above, the pivoting flap with the path limitation means is arranged in such a way in this case that it can be pivoted without problems from the operating position into a loading position to equip the waxing device with a new paraffin wax body. The pivoting flap is fixed in an operating position in such a way that it is ensured that the path limitation means reproducibly position the paraffin wax body in various, predeterminable working positions.<br>
With a configuration of this type of the waxing device, the paraffin wax body is not only mounted in a protected manner and, if necessary so as to be very easily exchangeable, but also the quantity of the paraffin wax application onto the thread<br>
4<br><br>
can be precisely metered, easily and in a reproducible manner at any time, by corresponding rotation of the path limitation means. With an embodiment of this type, the possibility also exists of positioning the paraffin wax body in a position in which the application of paraffin wax onto the running thread is prevented.<br>
No time-consuming fitting or adjustment work occurs during adjustment of the various working positions.<br>
According to claims 2 and 3, it is also provided in an advantageous embodiment that the pivoting flap can be locked in its operating position by means of a permanent magnet arrangement. In other words, the pivoting flap is preferably manufactured from a ferromagnetic material, for example steel, while permanent magnet elements are let into the housing surrounding the paraffin wax body and which consists of a plastics material, for example.<br>
A permanent magnet arrangement of this type is not only economical but also very reliable in terms of function. A permanent magnet arrangement of this type also works virtually without maintenance.<br>
As indicated in claim 4, the path limitation means are preferably manufactured from a relatively wear-resistant plastics material, and, as described in claim 5, distinguished for the operating staff in such a way that their respective adjustment, in other words their angular position can immediately be recognized without any doubt. In other words, the path limitation means are produced economically, for example, by an injection moulding method and the height of the various stops of the path limitation means are distinguished by colour. During the winding operation, the operator can easily establish, with the aid of the adjusted colour of the path limitation means, the angular position thereof and therefore the working position of the paraffin wax body and optionally correct it.<br>
5<br><br>
Because of the distinguishing of the stops by colour, it is also easy to check in this case, whether, in the case of the path limitation means, respective stops with the same height are resting on the paraffin wax body. The same colours should preferably constantly oppose one another.<br>
As described in claims 6 to 8, the waxing device has a cover with an upper thread guide means which is arranged downstream from the paraffin wax body in the thread running direction and which, in conjunction with a lower thread guide means arranged upstream from the paraffin wax body in the thread running direction, defines the plane of the thread running path in the region of the waxing device. The two stationary thread guide means are configured and positioned, in this case, such that the running thread is supported in the region of the waxing device and can form a traversing triangle, which covers broad parts of the end face of the paraffin wax body. The lower thread guide means, in this case, defines the starting point of a traversing triangle, while the upper thread guide means, preferably a horizontally running thread guide strip, ensures that the thread traverses in a predetermined plane such that uniform and gentle abrasion of the paraffin wax body takes place with optimum waxing of the running thread.<br>
This means that the advantageous arrangement of the thread guide means ensures not only a uniform paraffin wax application, but owing to the shape of the upper thread guide means, which is configured as an elongate, horizontally running thread guide strip, it is also ensured that most substantially constant conditions are provided during the traversing of the thread.<br>
According to claim 8, the thread guide strip is preferably manufactured from an engineering, abrasion-resistant ceramic material. Components, which are manufactured from a material of this type are distinguished by a relatively long service life. In other words, despite high stress owing to the- running thread, the thread guide strip is very durable.<br>
6<br><br>
The paraffin wax body is advantageously rotated during the winding operation by means of an electric motor single drive (claim 9). A wax beaker, which surrounds the paraffin wax body, is arranged in a rotationally engaged manner via a corresponding bearing lug on the motor shaft of the electric motor drive. In other words, the paraffin wax body is mounted so as to be rotationally engaged but axially displaceable on the bearing lug of the wax beaker. A configuration of this type has the advantage, in particular, that if necessary the speed of rotation of the individual paraffin wax bodies can be easily adjusted individually.<br>
The single drive is preferably configured, in this case, as shown in claim 10, as a stepping motor. A stepping motor of this type represents an economical and virtually maintenance-free drive means.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows, in a side view, the workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment, an automatic cross-winding machine, with a waxing device configured according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the waxing device according to Fig. 1, in a front view, to an enlarged scale,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the waxing device configured according to the invention, in a side view, partially in section,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a bottom view onto a path limitation means of the waxing device.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows, in a side view, a workstation 2 of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the present case, a so-called automatic cross-winding machine 1. Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type have a large<br>
7<br><br>
number of similar workstations 2 arranged next to one another in a row, on which, as known and therefore not described in more detail, spinning cops 3, which have relatively small yarn volumes, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 5. The thread 16 running from the spinning cop 3 is monitored during rewinding for possible yarn defects, which are optionally cleared out. Moreover, the thread 16 is improved during the rewinding process with regard to its running and sliding properties; in other words, the running thread 16 is preferably waxed.<br>
The running thread 16 is guided, for this purpose, via a waxing device 19, which ensures that paraffin wax particles are applied to the thread 16 and the friction resistance of the thread 16 is thus significantly reduced. The waxing device 19 will be described in more detail below with the aid of Fig. 2 to 4.<br>
After their completion, the cross-wound bobbins 5 are transferred by means of an automatically working service unit (not shown) to a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 7 along the length of the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 1, automatic cross-winding devices 1 of this type are often equipped with a bobbin and tube transporting system 6, in which the spinning cops 3 or the empty tubes circulate on transporting plates 11. Only the cop supply section 24, the reciprocally drivable storage section 25, one of the transverse transporting sections 26 leading to the winding stations 2 and the sleeve return section 27 are shown of the winding and tube transporting system 6 in Fig. 1.<br>
The individual workstations 2, furthermore, have various devices, which ensure proper operation of workstations of this type. These devices are known per se and therefore only indicated in Fig. 1.<br>
One of these known devices is, for example, the winding mechanism 4, which has a creel 8 that is movably mounted about a pivot pin 12. According to the present<br>
8<br><br>
embodiment, the cross-wound bobbin 5 rests with its surface on a drive drum 9 during the winding process and is entrained via frictional engagement by this drive drum 9 that is acted upon by a single motor. The associated drive 33 is connected, in this case, to a workstation computer via a control line 35.<br>
To traverse the threads 16 during the winding process, a thread traversing device 10 is provided. A thread traversing device 10, indicated only schematically in Fig. 1 has a thread guide 13, for example, with a finger-like thread transfer lever. The thread transfer lever that is acted upon by an electromechanical drive 14 traverses the thread 16 between the two end faces of the cross-wound bobbin 5. The drive 14 of the thread guide 13 is also connected to the workstation computer 28 via a control line 15.<br>
The workstations 2 of automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type furthermore have, as already indicated above, a waxing device 19, which is arranged, for example, in the thread running path directly upstream from the thread traversing device 10.<br>
In this case, Fig. 2 shows a front view of the waxing device 19, while Fig. 3 shows the waxing device 19 according to the invention in section.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3, the waxing device 19 has a stationary housing 23 which is fixed on the winding station housing 60 via a corresponding holder. Fastened to this housing 23 is an electric motor drive, preferably a stepping motor 34, which is also connected to the winding station computer 28 via a control line 57. The motor shaft of the stepping motor 34 is configured as a bearing shaft 58, on which a wax beaker, which receives a paraffin wax body 18, is arranged so as to be exchangeable, via a bearing lug 36.<br>
The paraffin wax body 18 is connected, so as to be rotationally engaged, but axially displaceable, to the bearing lug 36 of the wax beaker 41 via an entraining disc 37,<br>
9<br><br>
which has pins 38 or the like. The paraffin wax body 18 is axially displaced on the bearing lug 36 via a spring element 39 which is supported on a pressure plate 40 and loads the entraining disc 37 and therefore the paraffin wax body 18 in the direction R. In other words, the paraffin wax body 18 is displaced in the direction R, until it rests with its front side 41 on one of the stops I, II, III or IV of the path limitations means 17, which are fastened on a pivoting plate 21 so as to be rotatable in each case about a pivot pin 50.<br>
The pivoting flap 21 is articulated, in this case, on the front side to the housing 23 and can be pivoted between an operating position and a loading position. In the operating position, the pivoting plate 21 is locked, in this case, by a permanent magnet arrangement 22. The permanent magnet arrangement 22 preferably consists of permanent magnet elements 29 let into the housing 23 and the pivoting flap 21 manufactured from ferromagnetic material.<br>
As indicated above, path limitation means 17 configured according to the invention are arranged on the pivoting flap 21 and are rotatably mounted about a pivot pin 50 and equipped with stops I, II, III, IV of different heights. The various working positions of the paraffin wax body 18 which is mounted so as to be axially displaceable on the bearing lug 36 of the wax beaker 41 but mounted so as to be rotationally engaged, can be adjusted via the angular position of the path limitation means 17 or the associated stops I, II, III, IV.<br>
As shown, in particular, in Fig.4, the path limitation means 17 have stops I, II, III, IV of different heights on their rear, which can be used depending on the angular position of the path limitation means 17. In other words, when the paraffin body 18 rests on the stop I, according to the angular position of the path limitation means 17, a maximum paraffin wax application takes place. If the paraffin wax body 18 rests on the stop II, the paraffin wax application is somewhat lower. The stop III defines a minimal paraffin wax application. If the path limitation means 17 are adjusted such<br>
10<br><br>
that the paraffin wax body 18 rests on the stop IV, no paraffin wax application takes place.<br>
In this working position of the paraffin wax body 18, the running thread 16 traverses at a spacing from the front side 41 of the paraffin wax body 18.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 2, the thread 16 drawn off from the spinning cop 3, on its way to the cross-wound bobbin 5 directly before it is traversed by the thread traversing device 10, arrives at a thread tensile force sensor 20 and the waxing device 19 configured according to the invention. In other words, the thread 16 running in the arrow direction F runs in the region of the waxing device 19, initially through a lower thread guide means 31, which is formed, for example, by a thread guide slot in a thread tensile force sensor 20 arranged below the waxing device 19. The thread 16 then arrives through a traversing opening 44 in the cover 43 of the waxing device 19 in the region of the rotating front side 41 of the paraffin wax body 18 and at an upper thread guide means 30 arranged in the cover 43 of the waxing device 19.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the lower thread guide means 31 arranged in the thread running path upstream from the paraffin wax body 18 forms the starting point for a traversing triangle of the thread 16, while the upper thread guide means 30 which is arranged in the thread running path downstream from the waxing body 18 and which is configured as a substantially horizontally extending thread guide strip 32 supports the thread 16 uniformly during the traversing. The thread guide means 30 and 31 therefore define the plane of the thread running path-in the region of the waxing device 19.<br>
