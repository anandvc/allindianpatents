				<td>Electrical plug connector<br>
The invention relates to an electrical plug connector for connection of an<br>
electrical cable to an apparatus, in particular to a sensor or an actuator, or for<br>
detachable connection of two electrical cables to one another, having a<br>
housing, having a contact mount which holds a variety of contacts, and<br>
having an electronics circuit which is arranged in the housing with the<br>
electronics circuit having at least one light-emitting element, in particular an<br>
LED and be electrically connected to the contacts.<br>
Essentially, electrical plug connections are composed of two parts, the<br>
electrical plug connector and the mating plug connector. It can either be<br>
used to connect an electrical cable to an electrical or electronic appliance, or<br>
to connect two cables to one another. In the first case, the mating plug<br>
connector is connected to the electrical housing, and in the second case it is<br>
connected to the cable. Both the plug connector and the mating plug<br>
connector each have a contact mount with corresponding contacts, which are<br>
either contact pins or the corresponding sockets. Dependent on whether the<br>
contact pins or sockets are arranged in the respective contact mount, the<br>
associated connecting part is referred to as a plug or a socket.<br>
In the case of plug connections such as these, it is known for the plug<br>
connector and the mating plug connector to be mechanically connected to<br>
one another by, for example, arranging a union nut on the plug connector,<br>
which is screwed to the thread that is formed on the outer sleeve of the<br>
mating plug connector. In this case, the union nut then has an internal thread<br>
which corresponds with the thread on the mating plug connector. However,<br>
as an alternative to this, it is also possible for a union screw to be arranged<br>
on the plug connector and to have an external thread, so that the plug<br>
connector with the union screw can be screwed into an outer sleeve, which<br>
has a corresponding internal thread, on the mating plug connector.<br>
Electrical plug connections or plug connectors such as these are used in<br>
automation as a component of electronic equipment, sensors, actuators and<br>
controllers. In this case, in particular, M12 and M8 types are in widespread<br>
use, with three, four, five or eight contacts, in which case the electrical plug<br>
connectors and mating plug connectors are known both in a straight form<br>
and in a form angled through 90°. In the case of the latter, the housing of the<br>
electrical plug connector is angled through 90°, so that there is an angle of<br>
 <br>
90° between the longitudinal direction of the connecting cable being held<br>
and the longitudinal direction of the contacts. Corresponding plug<br>
connections are known, for example, from the 2005 Catalogue<br>
"Positionssensorik" [Position sensor system], pages 430-444 from ifm<br>
electronic gmbh.<br>
Electrical plug connectors such as these can either be connected as required<br>
or can be ready-wired, in which case the contact mount and the cable are<br>
extrusion-coated by the housing, which is then also referred to as a grip.<br>
Finally, electrical plug connectors may also be in the form of adapters, with<br>
the plug connector then having two contact mounts, which can each be<br>
connected to a corresponding mating contact mount. In this case, as a rule, a<br>
cable which has already been connected to a corresponding mating contact<br>
mount is connected at least to one contact mount, while the other contact<br>
mount is then generally connected to the mating contact mount of a device<br>
or apparatus.<br>
Electrical plug connectors of the type described initially and which are used<br>
in particular for connection of an electrical connection to an appliance, in<br>
particular a sensor, also have, in addition to the contact mount, an<br>
electronics circuit having at least one light-emitting element, generally an<br>
LED. The LEDs, of which there are up to three in practice, are in this case<br>
used to visually signal the serviceability and in particular the switching state<br>
of the connected sensor.<br>
For this purpose, either an appropriate window is formed in the housing,<br>
which is generally closed by a separate, transparent cover, or the housing is<br>
entirely composed of a transparent material. In this way, the light beams<br>
which are emitted from the LEDs can pass either through the transparent<br>
cover or through the transparent material of the housing, so that the status of<br>
the LED can be seen.<br>
The first variant has the disadvantage that, first of all, the production is<br>
relatively complex and costly since the various parts - housing and cover -<br>
must be produced and connected to one another, for example by adhesive<br>
bonding or ultrasound welding. Furthermore, the two-part configuration<br>
means that sealing problems can also occur, so that, for applications in<br>
which the sealing of the housing is significant, the complexity and thus also<br>
 <br>
the costs for production of a corresponding electrical plug connector rise<br>
further.<br>
For this reason, a transparent plastic is being increasingly used to produce<br>
the housing in practice for electrical plug connectors which have at least one<br>
LED. For applications in which the electrical plug connector is subject to<br>
strong external incident light, there is a problem, however, in that it is often<br>
no longer reliably possible to tell whether or not an LED is illuminated.<br>
Because of the transparent material that is used, it is also possible in<br>
particular in this case for reflections to occur of the light striking the plug<br>
connector from the outside onto components arranged in the housing, which<br>
it is then virtually impossible to distinguish from the light from an LED.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of providing an<br>
electrical plug connector as described in the introduction, which avoids the<br>
disadvantages mentioned above and furthermore can be produced as easily<br>
as possible, and thus at low cost.<br>
In the case of the electrical plug connector described in the introduction, this<br>
object is achieved and the housing is composed of a thermoplastic material,<br>
at least in the area of the light-emitting element, with the thermoplastic<br>
material having an additive which influences the transparency and colour,<br>
and which reduces the transparency of the thermoplastic material. Contrary<br>
to the procedure which has been practised until now in the prior art, of using<br>
a highly transparent material at least in the area of the light-emitting<br>
element, the invention now proposes that the transparency of the material be<br>
deliberately reduced. In this case this is done in a simple manner by adding<br>
an additive to the thermoplastic material for production of the housing, thus<br>
reducing the colour and hence the transparency of the housing.<br>
In this case, a colour concentrate with organic and/or inorganic dyes is<br>
preferably used as the additive, and is added to the thermoplastic material in<br>
the form of powder or granulate. In this case, the dyes preferably have a<br>
grey or black colour, so that the complete housing also overall has a grey to<br>
black colour. The proportion by weight of the additive is in this case less<br>
than 5%, preferably between 1% and 3%, and in particular about 2%, thus<br>
making it possible to reduce the transparency by about 60% to 80%,<br>
preferably by about 70%.<br>
 <br>
As before, the colouring of the housing according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to tell whether an LED is illuminated from the outside through the<br>
housing, furthermore resulting in a considerable increase in contrast, so that<br>
the status of an LED can be seen well even when the plug connector is<br>
subject to strong external incident light. In this case, the thermoplastic<br>
materials which are already known from practical use, in particular<br>
polyurethane, thermoplastic elastomer or polyvinyl chloride, can still be<br>
used as the basic material for the housing, so that the production process for<br>
the electrical plug connector can remain virtually unchanged.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the housing of the<br>
electrical plug connector is composed entirely of the thermoplastic material<br>
which is provided with the additive. The housing can thus still be produced<br>
in a single injection-moulding process. No sealing problems can occur at<br>
junctions between different housing parts. Furthermore, the use of a housing<br>
that is coloured overall has the advantage that the electronics circuit which is<br>
arranged within the housing and/or is extrusion-coated by the thermoplastic<br>
material can no longer be seen as clearly from the outside as would be the<br>
case with a "completely" transparent housing. In consequence, a user's<br>
attention is no longer distracted, so that he can concentrate on telling<br>
whether the LED is or is not illuminated. Preferably the colouring of the<br>
housing is such that the housing is completely nontransparent and only the<br>
specific wavelength of the LED - if illuminated - can be seen from outside<br>
the housing.<br>
In principle, the colour of the housing of the electrical plug connector is<br>
independent on what configuration the electrical plug connector would<br>
otherwise have. In particular, the electrical plug connector may already be<br>
ready-wired and connected to an electrical cable, in which case one end of<br>
the cable is then sealed on the side of the housing facing away from the<br>
contact mount. Since the housing is generally produced using an injection-<br>
moulding process that end of the cable which is electrically connected to the<br>
electronics circuit is thus also directly extrusion-coated during the<br>
production of the electrical plug connector.<br>
Alternatively, however, the electrical plug connector can also be designed<br>
such that it can be wired up as required, so that the electrical plug connector<br>
has appropriate connecting elements for connection of the individual<br>
 <br>
conductors of a separate electrical cable. Finally, the electrical plug<br>
connector may also have two contact mounts, wherein the contacts of the<br>
second contact mount are likewise electrically connected to the electronics<br>
circuit, so that a cable which is connected to a corresponding mating contact<br>
mount can then be connected to the second contact mount.<br>
According to a final particular embodiment of the invention, which will also<br>
be explained briefly here, the electrical plug connector has at least two<br>
LEDs which are arranged under a transparent cover which is arranged<br>
within the housing, in which case two symbols which are associated with the<br>
two LEDs are formed in the housing above the cover. The two symbols have<br>
preferably the shape of two arrows which point in opposite directions and<br>
through which the light from the LEDs can pass.<br>
An embodiment of the electrical plug connector such as this is particularly<br>
advantageous when the electrical plug connector is intended to be connected<br>
to so-called "intelligent" sensors, which have an integrated microcontroller.<br>
In an electrical plug connector such as this, the electronics circuit of the plug<br>
connector likewise has a microcontroller, so that the sensor is not only<br>
supplied with electrical power via the plug connector, but data can also be<br>
transmitted to and from the sensor via the electrical plug connector. The<br>
symbols which are formed in the housing, in particular by being embossed,<br>
can then indicate the direction of the actual data transfer, by the illumination<br>
of the LED associated with the corresponding symbol. Reference should be<br>
made to the subsequently published DE 10 2005 049 483 A1 for the specific<br>
configuration of an "intelligent" electrical plug connector such as this.<br>
The transparent cover, which is arranged above the LEDs, may in this case<br>
be used in particular for focusing and guidance of the light emitted from the<br>
LEDs, to the symbols formed in the housing. The cover is in this case<br>
preferably in the form of a shutter such that only the light coming from the<br>
associated LED in each case passes through the two symbols. This ensures<br>
that, despite the physical proximity of the two LEDs within the housing,<br>
light passes only through the symbol associated with one LED when that<br>
LED is illuminated.<br>
The LEDs are preferably mounted using SMD technology on a printed<br>
circuit board associated with the electronics circuit or on a flexible<br>
 <br>
conductor film, so that a plurality of LEDs can be used even in a small<br>
housing, as is the case with M8 plugs.<br>
In detail, there are now a large number of possible ways to refine and<br>
develop the electrical plug connector according to the invention. For this<br>
purpose, reference is made on the one hand to the dependent claims, and on<br>
the other hand to the following description of the preferred exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention described with reference to the attached<br>
drawing. In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows an electrical plug connector according to the prior art,<br>
Figure 2 shows an electrical plug connector according to the invention,<br>
from the rear, with illuminated and non-illuminated LEDs,<br>
Figure 3 shows one embodiment of the electrical plug connector as<br>
shown in Figure 2, from the side and from the front, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a second exemplary embodiment of an electrical plug<br>
connector according to the invention, from the side and from<br>
the rear.<br>
The figures show various exemplary embodiments of an electrical plug<br>
connector 1, with Figure 1 showing an electrical plug connector 1 according<br>
to the prior art and Figures 2 to 4 showing two variants of an electrical plug<br>
connector 1 according to the invention. The electrical plug connectors 1<br>
illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 are used for connection of an electrical cable 2 to<br>
an electronic apparartus, in particular a sensor, for example a proximity<br>
switch, a temperature sensor or a flow sensor.<br>
The electrical plug connector 1 - both according to the prior art and<br>
according to the invention - has a housing 3, a contact mount 5 which holds<br>
a plurality of contacts 4 and an electronics circuit 6 arranged in the housing<br>
3. In this case, the electronics circuit 6 generally has a printed circuit board<br>
on which, in addition to a number of electrical and electronic components, a<br>
plurality of LEDs 7, generally up to three LEDs 7, are arranged. The LEDs 7<br>
are in this case used as a status indication for the connected sensor. The<br>
electrical plug connector 1 is also referred to as a cable plug or a cable<br>
 <br>
socket, dependent on the nature of the contacts arranged in the contact<br>
mount 5 - plugs or sockets.<br>
In order that it is possible to tell from outside the housing 3 in the case of the<br>
known electrical plug connector 1 illustrated in Figure 1 whether the LEDs 7<br>
arranged in the housing 3 are or are not illuminated, the housing 3 is<br>
composed of a completely transparent plastic. As indicated in Figure 1, the<br>
electronics circuit 6 with the electrical and electronic components arranged<br>
on it, in particular the LEDs 7, can thus be seen through the housing 3, as<br>
well. If the known electrical plug connector 1 is now subjected to strong<br>
external incident light, then it is very often no longer possible to reliably tell,<br>
especially when looked at it quickly, whether one or more of the LEDs 7 is<br>
or is not illuminated.<br>
In contrast, in the case of the electrical plug connector 1 according to the<br>
invention and illustrated in Figures 2 to 4, the housing 3 is no longer<br>
composed of "completely" transparent material, but of a thermoplastic<br>
material to which an additive 8 which influences the transparency and<br>
colour has been added. Thus, overall, the housing 3 has a grey or black<br>
colour depending on the proportion by weight of the additive 8. An<br>
illuminated LED 7 can thus, as before, be seen from outside the housing 3,<br>
while an LED 7 which is not illuminated and the electronics circuit 6 cannot<br>
be seen, or can be seen only poorly. This is illustrated in Figure 2 by the fact<br>
that, in Figure 2a (LEDs off), the LEDs 7 which are arranged in the interior<br>
of the housing 3 are illustrated just by dashed lines while, in Figure 2b<br>
(LEDs on), the LEDs 7 are illustrated by solid lines.<br>
Polyurethane (PUR) or polyether polyurethane is preferably used as the<br>
thermoplastic material for the housing 3, since these plastics have a very<br>
good resistance to oils, and are considerably better than thermoplastic<br>
elastomer (TPE). In this case, the proportion by weight of the additive 8 is<br>
chosen, preferably in the range from 1% to 3%, such that the transparency of<br>
the thermoplastic material of the housing 3 is decreased by 20 to 40%,<br>
preferably by about 30%. In this case, the resultant increase in contrast<br>
improves the capability to see an illuminated LED 7, particularly in the<br>
presence of incident light, considerably.<br>
 <br>
The electrical plug connectors 1 according to the invention and illustrated in<br>
Figures 2 to 4 have a union nut 9 for mechanical connection to a<br>
corresponding mating plug connector, which is arranged such that it can<br>
rotate and can be moved axially to a limited extent on the contact mount 5.<br>
The union nut 9, which has an internal thread, can thus be screwed onto a<br>
sleeve, which has a corresponding external thread, on a mating plug<br>
connector. In order to make is easier to screw the union nut 9 on, it has a<br>
knurl 10 on its outer circumference. The electrical plug connector 1 also has<br>
vibration protection, which prevents the union nut 9 from inadvertently<br>
becoming loose from the sleeve of the mating connector. The vibration<br>
protection is in this case provided by an appropriate embodiment of the<br>
contact mount 5 and of the union nut 9. In order to allow a union nut 9<br>
which has been tightened firmly to be released relatively easily again, the<br>
union nut 9 also has a flat 11 for a spanner.<br>
While, in the case of the electrical plug connector 1 illustrated in Figures 2<br>
and 3, the conductors 12 in the electrical cable 2 have already been firmly<br>
connected to the electronic circuit 6 and the electrical cable 2 has been<br>
surrounded by the housing 3 on the side facing away from the contact mount<br>
5, the electrical plug connector 1 shown in Figure 4 has a second contact<br>
mount 13, which is provided for connection of a cable 2 with a<br>
corresponding plug. An electrical plug connector 1 such as this can also be<br>
referred to as an adaptor. In addition to this difference with respect to the<br>
connection of the electrical cable 2, the electrical plug connector illustrated<br>
in Figure 4 also has further differences from the plug connectors 1 illustrated<br>
in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Specifically, the electrical plug connector 1 illustrated in Figure 4 is an<br>
"intelligent" plug connector 1, which is intended for connection to an<br>
"intelligent" sensor which has a microcontroller. The sensor can then not<br>
only be supplied with electrical power via the electrical plug connector 1,<br>
which likewise has a microcontroller, but data can also be transmitted from<br>
the sensor and to the sensor. Reference is made to the subsequently<br>
published DE 10 2005 049 483 A1 with regard to the further configuration<br>
of the "intelligent" plug connector 1 illustrated in Figure 4, in particular with<br>
regard to the configuration and function of the microcontroller associated<br>
with the electronics circuit 6.<br>
 <br>
As can be seen from Figure 4a, in the case of the electrical plug connector 1<br>
illustrated there, a transparent cover 14 is arranged between the electronics<br>
circuit 6, which has two LEDs 7, and the upper face of the housing 3,<br>
through which light emitted from the LEDs 7 is passed to the upper face 15<br>
of the housing 3. Two arrows 16, 17 which point in opposite directions are<br>
formed, in particular embossed, on the upper face 15 of the housing 3<br>
associated with the LEDs 7, through which light from a respectively<br>
associated LED 7 can shine. In fact, the two LEDs 7 illustrated in Figure 4a<br>
are arranged one behind the other in the plane of the drawing - and not<br>
alongside one another, as illustrated. The cover 14 is in this case used not<br>
only for guidance of the light emitted from the LEDs 7 but furthermore, also<br>
as a shutter, which is designed such that the light shines only through one of<br>
the arrows 16, 17 in each case from the associated LED 7. The operator can<br>
thus tell immediately, depending on which arrow 16, 17 is or is not<br>
illuminated, the direction, for example, in which data is being transferred<br>
through the "intelligent" electrical plug connector 1.<br>
In addition to the embodiments of the electrical plug connector 1 illustrated<br>
in the figures, which each relate to an embodiment angled through 90°, in<br>
which the longitudinal direction of a connected electrical cable 2 and the<br>
longitudinal direction of the contacts 4 of the contact mount 5 therefore form<br>
an angle of about 90°, the electrical plug connector 1 may, of course, also be<br>
in the form of a "straight" plug connector. Furthermore, the electrical plug<br>
connector 1 shown in Figure 4 also has an inclined area in which the<br>
symbols, which are in the form of arrows 16, 17, are embossed in the<br>
housing 3 or in the upper face 15 of the housing 3.<br>

the LEDs (7) are surface mounted devices (SMDs).<br>
12.	Electrical plug connector according to one of claims 1 to 11, having<br>
two LEDs (7), characterized in that the LEDs (7) are arranged under a<br>
transparent cover (14) which is arranged within the housing (3), and in that<br>
two symbols which are associated with the two LEDs (7) in particular two<br>
arrows (16, 17) which point in opposite directions and through which the<br>
light from the LEDs (7) can pass, are formed in the housing (3) above the<br>
cover (14).<br>
13.	Electrical plug connector according to claim 12, characterized in that<br>
the cover (14) is in the form of a aperture such that only the light coming<br>
from the associated LED (7) in each case passes through the two symbols.<br>
 <br>
14. Electrical plug connector according to one of claims 1 to 13,<br>
characterized in that the plug connector (1) has a cross section which is<br>
angled through about 90°, such that there is an angle of about 90° between<br>
the longitudinal direction of a connected electrical cable (2) and the<br>
longitudinal direction of the contacts (4).<br>
 <br>
An electrical plug connector is illustrated and described, for connection of an electrical cable (2) to an apparatus, in particular to a sensor or an actuator, having a housing (3), having a contact mount (5) which holds a variety of<br>
contacts (4), and having an electronics circuit (6) which is arranged in the housing (3) with the electronics circuit (6) having at least one light-emitting element, in particular an LED (7) and being electrically connected to the<br>
contacts (4). In the plug connector (1), the status of the LED (7) - LED (7) illuminated or<br>
LED (7) not illuminated - can be identified particularly well, even in the presence of strong external incident light, in that the housing (3) is composed of a thermoplastic material, at least in the area of the LEDs (7),<br>
with the thermoplastic material having an additive (8) which influences the<br>
transparency and colour, and which reduces the transparency of the thermoplastic material.</td>
