				<td>This invention relates to a green air conditioner.<br>
The use of air conditioners and air coolers is well established in the art and the construction is also known to the public.  However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the conventional air air conditioner.<br>
One of the main disadvantage associated with the conventional air conditioner is that CFC refrigerant is used in the conventional air conditioner and which is injurious to the environment as it causes ozone depletion.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the conventional air conditioner causes chilling injury in, the absence of effective temperature control system.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the running cost of the conventional air conditioner is very high.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the initial cost and subsequent maintenance of the air conditioner is very high.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to propose a green air conditioner which obeviates above disadvantages.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an air conditioner which is environmental friendly and<br>
does not causes any injury to the environment.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is is to propose an air conditioner whose initial cost is very low and maintenance cost is also very low.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an air conditioner which saves lot of electric energy and also the running cost of the air conditioner is very low.<br>
According to this invention there is provided<br>
a green air  conditioner comprising a rotatable dehumidifier disposed into a housing towards the rear end thereof for dehumidifying the atmospheric air and passing the same to the precooling means provided in the middle portion of the housing, a water cooling tower being provided in the said housing towards front side thereof, for cooling and rehumidifying the air, an air inlet fan and an air exhaust fan being provided at the rear side of said housing for supplying atmospheric air to said de-humidifier and discharging the humidified air therefrom respectively, a cool air fan being provided at the front/grill side of said housing for supplying cool air to the room, a make-up water tank being provided in the front portion of said housing for supplying water to said water cooling tower.<br>
In accordance with this invention the air conditioner has a main housing.  A dehumidifier wheel is disposed into<br>
said housing in the rear side of the housing which is exposed to the atmosphere outside the room and such that to receive the atmospheric air by the  lower half portion thereof and supplied by means of  an inlet air fan provided near the bottom side of said housing.  A pre-cooling wheel/heat exchanger is disposed into said housing in middle portion thereof  such that the dehumidifier air is passed through the lower half portion of the cooling wheel provided for air-to-air cooling of the air. A water cooling tower is provided in the front portion of the housing for cooling the air passed there through after dehumidification and pre-cooling.  An exhaust  fan is provided at the rear side of said housing for facilitating the exit of the hot and humid air from said housing.  A cool air fan is provided at the front/grill side of the air conditioner for supplying the cool air to the room.  A water tank is provided in the  bottom portion of the cooling tower for supplying water to the cooling tower. An opening is provided in the bottom/lower side of the housing to supply ambient/atmospheric air in the portion of the housing after the dehumidifier.<br>
According to an option a cooling booster is provided at the front side of said housing for further cooling of the air by recirculating the room air there through, with the reinforced boosting with help of ice in this compartment.<br>
A green air conditioner according to a preferred embodiment of this invention herein described add illustrated in the accompanying drawings  wherein Fig-1   shows isometric view of the air conditioner.'<br>
Referring to the drawings the green air conditioner has a housing-1 for accomodating therein a dehumidifier-2 having a honey comb structure, in the rear portion thereof.  An electric motor-3 having a shaft-4 is provided in the rear portion of the housing-1 for rotating the dehumidifier-2.   The dehumidifier wheel-2 is provided for dehumidifying the atmospheric air being supplied by a fan-5 into the rear portion of the housing-1 which is adapted to be exposed to the atmosphere outside the building/ room.  Air cooling means-6 having honey-comb structure is mounted on the shaft-4 provided in the middle portion of the housing-1 rotatabily such that to cool the dehumidified air received from the dehumidifier-2.  A water cooling tower-7 is provided in the front portion of the housing-1 for cooling as well as rehumidifing the dehumidified pre cooled air supplied by the air cooling wheel-6.  A cool air fan-8 is  provided at the front/grill side in the upper portion thereof for supplying cool air to the room.  An opening-9 is provided in the upper portion of the cooling tower for facilitating supply of cool air towards the air cooling wheel-6 for cooling the upper half portion of the cooling wheel-6 during rotation.  An opening-10 is provided in the upper surface of the housing-1 for exit of the hot air.<br>
Another opening-11 is provided in the bottom side of the housing-1 for the entry of ambient/atmospheric air to the upper portion of the housing-1 and after the dehumidifier wheel-2.  A heater-12 is provided near the dehumidification wheel-2 for heating the air present therein such that to heat the upper half portion of the dehumidifier wheel for removing water from the dehumidifying agent provided in the dehumidifier.  An exhaust fan-13 is provided at the top of the rear portion of the housing for the exit of the exhaust air produced by the dehumidifier during its regeneration.  A water tank-14 is provided at the bottom portion of the cooling tower-7 for     supplying water to the water cooling tower.  Antibacterial and/or antifaulant chemical are provided in the water tank to help the tank clean.<br>
According to an option a cooling booster-15 having a fan at the upper end thereof is provided at the front/grill side for  further cooling of the room air by the circulation of the air through the cooling booster. The  cooling booster comprises cooling fins and/or ice Jacket for heat exc hange.<br>
According to another option hydraulic rotating means comprising a plurality of arms-16 provided with cup at the ends thereof are secured to the shaft-4 for rotating the shaft by means of hydraulic pressure received from the water pump of the water cooling tower-7.<br>
During the working of the air conditioner the ambient/atmospheric air is passed through lower half<br>
portion of the dehumidifier wheel and wherein the air is dehumidified.  The dehumidified air is then passed<br>
through the air cooling wheel wherein the air is pre-cooled.<br>
Thus it is seen that the air conditioner of the present invention works on the principal of dehumidification of the air so as to provide user friendly cooling environment in the room.  Further the compressor/refrigerant gases are not used the air conditioner of the present invention does not causes any damage/polution to the environment. The precooled air is then supplied to a water cooling tower wherein the precooled dehumidified air is further cooled with the help of watey  spray.  This cool air and humidifier air is supplied to the room provided at the upper end of the cooling tower towards the front/grill side of the air conditioner.  The upper half portion of the dehumidifier wheel is heated indirectly by passing the hot air there through.  Similarly the upper half portion<br>
of the air cooling wheel is cooled by passing the cool air received from the water cooling tower so as to cool the<br>
dehumidified air supplied by the dehumidifier.  These wheels are rotated slowly and continously for dehumidi-fication and precooling of the air during the working of the air conditioner, by the lower half  segments of each and for the purpose of regeneration during the<br>
time when these segements are in the upper half area that is, below or above the shaft plate which divides the main housing into upper half and lower half.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
