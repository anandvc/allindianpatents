Surface-rich clays used for the production of bleaching earth,<br>
and method for the activation of said clavs<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing an adsorbing<br>
agent, to an adsorbing agent obtained by the method, and to its<br>
use, and to a clay product.<br>
In the industrial production of oils and fats, bleaching earths<br>
are used to remove clouding, discolorations or else for<br>
removing oxidation accelerators. Adsorptive purification can<br>
significantly improve taste, color and storage stability of the<br>
oils and fats. Various classes of bleaching earths are used for<br>
the purification. A first group is the class of high<br>
performance bleaching earths (HPBE), based mostly on<br>
montmorillonite. This group includes, in particular, acid-<br>
activated montmorillonites, the acid activation being carried<br>
out in a complex method by dealuminization of the raw clays<br>
with concentrated acids at high temperatures. In this method, a<br>
bleaching earth product with very large specific surface and<br>
large pore volume is obtained. Even the use of small amounts of<br>
this high performance bleaching earth leads to noticeable<br>
purification of the crude oils. Low use amounts in the<br>
bleaching process are desirable because the spent bleaching<br>
earth binds to the residual amounts of oil, as a result of<br>
which the yield is reduced, and, secondly, the spent bleaching<br>
earth has to be disposed of in accordance with current<br>
procedures.<br>
The disadvantage of these high performance bleaching earths is<br>
the fact that the dealuminization with acid during the<br>
production produces large amounts of acidic salt-rich waste<br>
waters which can only be processed in complex processes or be<br>
disposed of. The high costs for the disposal of the waste<br>
waters as well as the complex production method account for the<br><br>
2<br>
comparatively high prices of such high performance bleaching<br>
earths.<br>
A further group is the class of naturally active clays. These<br>
naturally occurring bleaching earths have been used for<br>
centuries for the purification of fats and oils. These<br>
naturally active systems (so-called fuller's earth) can be made<br>
available very cost-effectively. However, they only have a low<br>
bleaching power, meaning that they are in most cases not<br>
suitable for the purification of oils and fats which are<br>
difficult to bleach. In addition, compared with high<br>
performance bleaching earths, significantly larger amounts of<br>
the adsorbing agent have to be used in order to achieve the<br>
desired bleaching results. As a result, however, higher losses<br>
of oil or fat have to be accepted since the bleaching earths<br>
cannot be separated off in pure form and certain amounts of oil<br>
or fat remain in the bleaching earth.<br>
A compromise between low production costs and acceptable<br>
activity is provided by the third class of bleaching earth, the<br>
so-called surface modified systems (SMBE = surface modified<br>
bleaching earth). Here, a naturally active raw clay is supplied<br>
with small amounts of acid and thus an "in situ activation" is<br>
achieved. For this method, raw clays containing attapulgite and<br>
hormite in particular have proven useful. These have a really<br>
high specific surface for natural raw clays of about 100 to<br>
180 m2/g and a pore volume of about 0.2 to 0.35 ml/g. However,<br>
since salts formed during the acid activation or unreacted acid<br>
fractions are not washed out, these remain on the product and<br>
are at least sometimes also deposited in the pores. As a<br>
result, these acid-activated bleaching earths generally do not<br>
achieve the same efficiency as is achieved by high performance<br>
bleaching earths (HPBE) which are produced by dealuminization<br>
with acid. The simple production method, however, permits a<br>
comparatively cost-effective production since no acidic waste<br>
waters are produced.<br>
US-A-5,008,226 discloses a method for producing acid-activated<br>
bleaching earth using a naturally occurring acidic attapulgite<br><br>
3<br>
clay in accordance with the acid activation described above.<br>
This clay has a pore volume in the range from 0.25 to 0.50 ml/g<br>
and a specific surface in the range form 100 to 150 m2/g.<br>
Particular preference is given to using a naturally occurring<br>
mixture of attapulgite and bentonite. The main components of<br>
this mineral consist of 71 to 75% by weight of SiCfe and of 11 to<br>
16% by weight of A1203. The attapulgite/bentonite mineral is<br>
supplied with acid, corresponding to an acid amount of 1 to 10%<br>
by weight, at a temperature of about 25 to 100°C. The acid-<br>
activated intermediate is not washed, but used directly as<br>
bleaching earth after drying and grinding.<br>
US-A-3,029,783 describes a method of treating an attapulgite<br>
clay with acid. The attapulgite comprises about 15% by weight<br>
of A1203. The acid-activated clay is suitable for use as cat<br>
litter.<br>
US-A-5,869,415 describes a method for activating sheet<br>
silicates with an ion exchange capacity of at least<br>
25 meq/100 g by activation with 1 to 10% by weight of acid and<br>
subsequent calcination at temperatures of 200°C to 400°C. The<br>
sheet silicates have specific surfaces in the range from 132 to<br>
167 m2/g, and a pore volume in the range from 0.27 to 0.35 ml/g<br>
and an ion exchange capacity of 38 to 68 meq/100 g.<br>
WO 99/02256 describes a method for producing a bleaching earth<br>
with an increased acid content. The activation takes place here<br>
in an environmentally friendly, i.e. nonaqueous, process.<br>
Preferably, 2.5 to 5% by weight of acid in aqueous solution are<br>
added to predried and ground raw clay. Examples of suitable<br>
acids that are described are hydrochloric acid and phosphoric<br>
acid and also citric acid, which are applied to a raw clay from<br>
the palygorskite smektite class.<br>
The above-described production of acid-activated bleaching<br>
earths i.e, sheet silicates, in particular smektites and<br>
palygorskites or mixtures of these silicates are thus usually<br>
used. The raw clays used as starting materials have specific<br>
surfaces in the range from 100 to 180 m2/g, a pore volume in-the<br>
range from 0.25 to 0.50 ml/g and an ion exchange capacity in<br><br>
4<br>
the range from 38 to 68 meq/100 g. These sheet silicates have<br>
an A1203 content of &gt; 11% by weight.<br>
As already explained above, surface-modified bleaching earths<br>
(SMBE) have the advantage of a cost-effective production.<br>
However, they do not achieve the bleaching effect as is<br>
achieved by high performance bleaching earths (HPBE).<br>
Therefore, compared with the high performance bleaching earths,<br>
larger amounts of surface-modified bleaching earth are required<br>
in order to achieve a desired bleaching result. This in turn<br>
means that during bleaching by adsorption of oils and fats in<br>
the bleaching earth, higher oil losses have to be accepted, and<br>
on the other hand relatively large amounts of spent bleaching<br>
earth have to be processed and/or disposed of.<br>
An object of the invention is therefore to provide a method for<br>
producing an adsorbing agent which avoids the disadvantages of<br>
the prior art and leads to a product with a high adsorption<br>
capacity, in particular with regard to the bleaching effect of<br>
oils and fats.<br>
This object is achieved with a method having the features of<br>
patent claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the method are the<br>
subject of the dependent claims.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that when using the raw clays<br>
defined in claim 1, through a comparatively simple activation,<br>
adsorption agents and/or bleaching earths are obtainable whose<br>
activity is comparable and sometimes superior to that of high<br>
performance bleaching earths obtained by intensive<br>
dealuminization with strong acids.<br>
Here, it is essential to the invention that the raw clay used<br>
has a specific surface (BET area) of more than 200 m2/g, an ion<br>
exchange capacity of more than 40 meq/100 g, and a pore volume<br>
of more than 0.5 ml/g, where at least 40% of the pore volume<br>
are provided by pores which have a pore diameter of at least<br>
14 nm, and at most 25% of the pore volume are provided by pores<br>
which have a diameter of less than 7.5 nm.<br><br>
5<br>
Suitable analytical methods for determining the specific<br>
surface area, the pore volume and the ion exchange capacity are<br>
given below in the examples.<br>
Preferably, at most 20%, in particular at most 15%, of the pore<br>
volume of the raw clay are provided by pores which have a pore<br>
diameter of less than 7.5 nm. Preferably, the pore volume<br>
fraction of the total pore volume which is provided by pores<br>
with a pore diameter in the range from 7.5 to 14 nm is at most<br>
25%, preferably at most 15%, especially preferably at most 10%.<br>
Preferably, the pore volume fraction of the total pore volume<br>
which is provided by pores with a pore diameter in the range<br>
from 14 to 25 nm is at most 25%, preferably at most 20%, in<br>
particular at most 15%. Preferably, the pore volume fraction of<br>
the total pore volume which is provided by pores with a pore<br>
diameter in the range from 25 to 80 nm is at least 25%,<br>
preferably at least 30%, particularly preferably at least 40%.<br>
Preferably, the pore volume fraction of the total pore volume<br>
which is provided by pores with a pore diameter of at least<br>
25 nm is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, particularly<br>
preferably at least 50%, and very particularly preferably at<br>
least 60%. Preferably, the pore volume fraction of the total<br>
pore volume which is provided by pores with a pore diameter of<br>
more than 80 nm is at most 30%, preferably at most 25%,<br>
particularly preferably at most 25%. The raw clay used in the<br>
method according to the invention has a high fraction of<br>
medium-sized or large pores. This differentiates it, for<br>
example, from high performance bleaching earths which are<br>
produced by acid leaching. These high performance bleaching<br>
earths have a higher fraction of smaller pores.<br>
Particular preference is given to using raw clays whose ion<br>
exchange capacity is above 50 meq/100 g, preferably in the<br>
range from 55 to 75 meq/100 g. Preferably, the raw clay has a<br>
specific surface (BET) in the range from 200 to 280 m2/g,<br>
particularly preferably in the range from 200 to 260 m2/g. The<br>
(total) pore volume (specific pore volume) of the raw clay used<br><br>
6<br>
is preferably in the range from 0.7 to 1.0 ml/100 g, in<br>
particular in the range from 0.80 to 1.0 ml/100 g.<br>
Preferably, the raw clay used in the method according to the<br>
invention has a fraction of heavy metals As, Pb, Cd, Hg that<br>
can be leached out by tartaric acid of less than 25 ppm,<br>
preferably less than 15 ppm, particularly preferably less than<br>
10 ppm. The fraction of arsenic that can be leached out by<br>
tartaric acid is preferably less than 1.5 ppm, preferably less<br>
than 1 ppm. The fraction of lead that can be leached out by<br>
tartaric acid is preferably less than 5 ppm, preferably less<br>
than 4 ppm. The fraction of cadmium that can be leached out by<br>
tartaric acid is preferably less than 0.5 ppm, preferably less<br>
than 0.3 ppm and the fraction of mercury that can be leached<br>
out by tartaric acid is preferably less than 0.2 ppm,<br>
preferably less than 0.1 ppm.<br>
A method for determining the fraction of heavy metals that can<br>
be leached out by tartaric acid is given in the examples.<br>
Preferably, the sediment volume of the raw clay in water is<br>
less than 10 ml/2 g, i.e. the raw clay virtually does not swell<br>
in the presence of water. As a result, the bleaching earth<br>
product can be distributed very evenly within the crude oil<br>
and, after the bleaching process, can also be very readily<br>
separated off again by filtration.<br>
In order to obtain an adsorbing agent or a bleaching earth with<br>
the desired properties, the raw clay is subjected to an<br>
activation, in particular an acid activation.<br>
An activation is understood as meaning the treatment of the raw<br>
clay as is customary in the production of SMBE. Such methods<br>
are known per se to the person skilled in the art. They can<br>
consist in a thermal treatment or, in particular, in a<br>
treatment with acid. During the activation, the mineral<br>
structure of the raw clay preferably remains essentially<br>
intact. Experience has shown that the specific surface and the<br>
pore volume of the raw clay can decrease by up to about 20%<br>
depending on the type of acid activation.<br><br>
7<br>
In the method according to the invention, a dried raw clay is<br>
firstly provided. For the purposes of the present invention,<br>
raw clay is understood as meaning a naturally active or non-<br>
naturally active clay material, the intention being that clay<br>
materials further processed by conventional, mechanical or<br>
chemical work-up steps, but, in delimitation to the bleaching<br>
earths, not activated in a (separate) activation step, are to<br>
be included. Activation of the raw clay is to be understood<br>
here as meaning a treatment which leads to an improvement in<br>
the bleaching effect, especially in the case of the bleaching<br>
of oils and fats, as is determined using the color numbers in<br>
oils (Lovibond color numbers) according to AOCS Cc 13b-45<br>
and/or the chlorophyll A determination in accordance with AOCS<br>
Cc 13d-55.<br>
Correspondingly, for the purposes of the present invention,<br>
bleaching earths are understood as meaning a clay material that<br>
has been activated (in an activation step), in particular that<br>
has been activated by thermal and/or acid treatment. The term<br>
bleaching earth is known to the person skilled in the art and<br>
covers activated clay materials which, on account of their<br>
adsorption activity and/or bleaching activity, can be used for<br>
the purification in particular of food oils and fats.<br>
In particular, raw clays are presently understood as meaning<br>
naturally occurring naturally active or non-naturally active<br>
clay materials which have not yet been subjected to a chemical<br>
modification, e.g. have not yet been coated with strong acids<br>
or dealuminized. Before the activation, the raw clays can, if<br>
appropriate, be dried and ground.<br>
Particular preference is given to using raw clays whose content<br>
of aluminum, based on the anhydrous raw clay and calculated as<br>
A1203, is less than 11% by weight.<br>
Particular preference is given to using raw clays which only<br>
have low crystallinity, i.e. are per se not assigned to the<br>
class of sheet silicates. The low crystallinity can be<br>
established, for example, by X-ray defractometry. The<br>
particularly preferred raw clays here are largely X-ray-<br><br>
8<br>
amorphous, they therefore do not belong to the class of<br>
attapulgites or smektites.<br>
Compared with conventional high performance bleaching earths,<br>
the raw clay used in the method according to the invention has<br>
a different pore distribution. In high performance bleaching<br>
earths, the pore volume is essentially formed by pores with a<br>
small diameter. The pores essentially have a diameter in the<br>
range from 2 to 14 nm. In contrast to this, in the raw clay<br>
used in the method according to the invention, the significant<br>
fraction of the pore volume is formed by pores which have an<br>
essentially larger diameter.<br>
It is a characteristic of the raw clays used according to the<br>
invention that at least 40% of the total pore volume<br>
(determined in accordance with the BJH method, cf. below) are<br>
formed by pores which have a pore diameter of more than 14 nm.<br>
Preferably, more than 50%, and particularly preferably more<br>
than 60% of the total pore, volume are formed by pores wfrxch<br>
have a diameter &amp;£ more than 14 nm. The total pore volume of<br>
these raw clays is, as already explained, more than 0.5 ml/g.<br>
The pore radius distribution or the total pore volume is<br>
determined by nitrogen porosimetry (DIN 66131) and evaluation<br>
of the adsorption isotherms in accordance with the BJH method<br>
(cf. below).<br>
It has been found that raw clays with the properties described<br>
above can be converted even through activation with small<br>
amounts of acid, as, for example, in the case of the<br>
abovementioned "in situ activation", into bleaching earth<br>
products which have surprisingly good bleaching properties. The<br>
bleaching effect of these bleaching earth products achieves the<br>
results of high performance bleaching earths or even surpasses<br>
them. "In situ activation" is understood as meaning an<br>
activation treatment of the raw clay as is customary in the<br>
case of the above described acid-activated bleaching earths<br>
(SMBE).<br>
In general, the activation according to the invention of the<br>
raw clays can be carried out by a treatment with acid. For this<br><br>
9<br>
purpose, the raw clays are brought into contact with an<br>
inorganic or organic acid. In principle, any method for the<br>
acid activation of clays known to the person skilled in the art<br>
can be used here, including the methods described in<br>
WO 99/02256, US-5,008,226 and US-5,869,415, which are in this<br>
regard expressly incorporated into the description by<br>
reference.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment according to the invention,<br>
it is not necessary for the excess acid and the salts which<br>
form during the activation to be washed out. Rather, after<br>
charging the acid, as is customary during acid activation, no<br>
washing step is carried out, but the treated raw clay is dried<br>
and then ground to the desired particle size. During grinding,<br>
a typical bleaching earth fineness is established in most<br>
cases. Here, the dry sieve residue on a sieve with a mesh width<br>
of 63 um is in the range from 20 to 40% by weight. The dry<br>
sieve residue on a sieve with a mesh width of 25 um is in the<br>
range from 50 to 65% by weight.<br>
In one embodiment of the method according to the invention, the<br>
activation of the raw clay is carried out in an aqueous phase.<br>
To this end, the acid is brought into contact in the form of an<br>
aqueous solution with the raw clay. The procedure here may be<br>
such that firstly the raw clay, which is preferably provided in<br>
the form of a powder, is slurried in water. Then, the acid is<br>
added in concentrated form. However, the raw clay can also be<br>
slurried directly in an aqueous solution of the acid, or the<br>
aqueous solution of the acid can be added to the raw clay.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the aqueous acid<br>
solution can, for example, be sprayed on to a preferably broken<br>
or pulverulent raw clay, in which case the amount of water is<br>
preferably chosen to be as small as possible and, for example,<br>
a concentrated acid or acid solution is used. The amount of<br>
acid can be chosen preferably between 1 and 10% by weight,<br>
particularly preferably between 2 and 6% by weight, of a strong<br>
acid, in particular of a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid,<br>
based on the anhydrous raw clay (bone dry). If necessary,<br><br>
10<br>
excess water can be evaporated off and the activated raw clay<br>
can then be ground to the desired fineness. As already<br>
explained above, no washing step is required in this embodiment<br>
of the method according to the invention either. After addition<br>
of the aqueous solution of the acid only drying is carried out,<br>
if necessary, until the desired moisture content is reached. In<br>
most cases, the water content of the resulting bleaching earth<br>
product is adjusted to a fraction of less than 20% by weight,<br>
preferably less than 10% by weight.<br>
For the above-described activation with an aqueous solution of<br>
an acid or of a concentrated acid, the acid can be selected<br>
arbitrarily. It is possible to use either mineral acids, or<br>
organic acids or mixtures of the above acids. Customary mineral<br>
acids can be used, such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid<br>
or sulfuric acid, with sulfuric acid being preferred.<br>
Concentrated or dilute acids or acid solutions can be used.<br>
Organic acids which can be used are solutions of, for example,<br>
citric acid or oxalic acid. Preference is given to citric acid.<br>
The particle size or the average particle size of the adsorbing<br>
agent according to the invention should preferably be selected<br>
so that, when the activated raw clay or the bleaching earth is<br>
used later on, it is possible to completely and simply remove<br>
the clay from the refined product. Preferably, the average<br>
particle size of the pulverulent raw clay is chosen in a range<br>
from 10 to 63 um. Typically, the fineness is chosen such that<br>
on a sieve with a mesh width of 63 um, about 20 to 40% by<br>
weight of the mixture remain (sieve residue) and on a sieve<br>
with a mesh width of 25 um, about 50 to 65% by weight of the<br>
mixture remain. This can be referred to as typical bleaching<br>
earth fineness.<br>
As already explained, the method according to the invention can<br>
be used, in a simple and cost-effective manner, to provide<br>
adsorbing agents and bleaching earth products whose adsorption<br>
activity or bleaching activity is surprisingly high and in some<br>
respects exceeds the activity of conventional high performance<br>
bleaching earths.<br><br>
11<br>
The invention therefore also provides an adsorbing agent, in<br>
particular a bleaching earth product, which is obtainable using<br>
the method described above. The adsorbing agents according to<br>
the invention can be produced in a cost-effective manner since,<br>
for example, no waste products are formed which have to be<br>
disposed of in a complex manner. As a result of their high<br>
bleaching activity, the adsorbing agents according to the<br>
invention allow the amounts which are required for the refining<br>
of, for example, oils and fats to be significantly reduced. As<br>
a consequence of this, the losses of starting material such as<br>
oils and fats which, upon separating off the adsorbing agent,<br>
remain therein, can also be significantly reduced.<br>
The invention therefore also provides the use of the adsorbing<br>
agent described above as a bleaching earth. In this connection,<br>
particular preference is given to using the adsorbing agent<br>
described above for the refining of oils and fats, in<br>
particular for the refining of vegetable oils. Furthermore, the<br>
adsorbing agent according to the invention can also be used as<br>
drying agent or for the adsorption of gases.<br>
The raw clay used for the production of the adsorbing agent<br>
according to the invention has even by itself advantageous<br>
properties, such as its easy and high activatibility with acid.<br>
The invention therefore also provides a clay product comprising<br>
a raw clay with<br>
a specific surface of more than 200 m2/g;<br>
an ion exchange capacity of more than 40 meq/lOOg; and<br>
a specific pore volume of more than 0.5 ml/g, where at<br>
least 40% of the pore volume are provided by pores which<br>
have a pore diameter of at least 14 nm,. and at most 25% of<br>
the pore volume are provided by pores which have a diameter<br>
of less than 7.5 nm.<br>
The specific surface (BET area) and the specific pore volume<br>
are determined using nitrogen porosimetry in accordance with<br>
DIN 66131. The specific surface is preferably in the range from<br>
200 to 270 m2/g, particularly preferably in the range from 200<br>
to 260 m2/g. The specific pore volume is preferably 0.5 to<br><br>
12<br>
1.0 ml/g, particularly preferably 0.7 to 1.0 ml/g. The ion<br>
exchange capacity is determined using the method described<br>
below in the examples. It is preferably more than 50 meg/100 g<br>
and is particularly preferably in the range from 55 to<br>
75 meq/100 g. A slurry of 10% by weight of the raw clay in<br>
water preferably has a pH in the range from 5.5 to 8.5,<br>
preferably 5.9 to 8.2. The pH is determined using a pH<br>
electrode.<br>
As already explained, the raw clay has a characteristic<br>
distribution of the pore radii. At least 40% of the pore volume<br>
is furnished by pores with a diameter of more than 14 ran.<br>
Preferably at least 50% of the pore volume, particularly<br>
preferably at least 60% of the pore volume, are furnished by<br>
pores with a diameter of at least 14 nm. The pore size and the<br>
pore size distribution can be determined by nitrogen<br>
porosimetry in accordance with DIN 66131 and evaluation by<br>
means of the BJH method. The total pore volume refers to pores<br>
with a diameter from 2 to 130 nm. The clay product consists<br>
preferably to at least 98%, particularly preferably to 100%, of<br>
raw clay. Particularly preferred values of the raw clay or of<br>
the clay product as regards the porosimetry, the sediment<br>
volume and the content of metals that can be leached out with<br>
tartaric acid have already been given above.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for the refining<br>
of fats and/or oils, where<br>
a crude oil is provided which is obtained from a<br>
vegetable or animal material;<br>
the crude oil is subjected to a bleaching by treating<br>
it with a bleaching earth product which comprises a raw<br>
clay which has<br>
a specific area of more than 200 m2/g;<br>
an ion exchange capacity of more than 40 meq/100 g;<br>
and<br>
a pore volume of more than 0.5 ml/g, where at least<br>
40% of the pore volume are provided by pores which<br><br>
13<br>
have a pore diameter of at least 14 nm, and at most<br>
25% of the pore volume are provided by pores which<br>
have a diameter of less than 7.5 nm, and<br>
the bleached oil is separated off from the bleaching<br>
earth product.<br>
Using the bleaching earth product used in the method according<br>
to the invention it is possible to achieve a considerable<br>
reduction in the Lovibond color number and simultaneously a<br>
significant reduction in the content of phosphorus and iron.<br>
The method according to the invention therefore permits a rapid<br>
and simple refining of oils and fats.<br>
Usually, during the refining of oils, the crude oils are<br>
firstly subjected to a degumming in order to remove gums from<br>
the oil. To this end, the oil is treated at temperatures in the<br>
range from 70 to 80°C with water, during which stirring is<br>
carried out for about 10 to 20 minutes at atmospheric pressure.<br>
After separating off the gums, for example by means of a<br>
centrifuge, an acid degumming follows, during which the<br>
predegummed oil is treated with acid, in particular phosphoric<br>
acid or citric acid, at temperatures in the range from 70 to<br>
100°C at atmospheric pressure. Removal of the gums takes place<br>
together with the aqueous phase, for example by centrifugation.<br>
In the case of the acid degumming, at the end of the treatment<br>
time, water, mostly in amounts of 1-2% by weight, based on the<br>
crude oil, can be added in order to improve the degree of<br>
effectiveness of the degumming.<br>
For the bleaching, the procedure may involve firstly carrying<br>
out a wet bleaching, in which the degummed oil is admixed with<br>
the bleaching earth and water and then the mixture is stirred<br>
at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of between about 80<br>
and 100°C. After the wet bleaching, the pressure is reduced,<br>
the bleaching is continued at a pressure in the region of about<br>
100 mbar and the temperature is, if appropriate, increased to<br>
the desired value, for example a temperature in the range from<br>
90 to 120°C.<br><br>
14<br>
In the method according to the invention, under certain<br>
prerequisites, it is possible to dispense with the acid<br>
degumming and a wet bleaching and, after adding the bleaching<br>
earth product, to start directly with the vacuum bleaching.<br>
This rationalized refining is suitable particularly for oils<br>
which have a phosphorus content, in particular phosphorus lipid<br>
content, of less than 100 ppm, preferably less than 50 ppm. The<br>
phosphorus content can be determined, for example, by elemental<br>
analysis.<br>
In particular, the method according to the invention is<br>
suitable for the refining of palm oil.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail by reference to<br>
examples and by reference to an attached figure. What is shown<br>
is:<br>
Fig. 1: a schematic process diagram for the physical refining<br>
of oils, in particular palm oil.<br>
Crude food oil, for example palm oil, is usually refined<br>
according to the principle of physical refining by a method as<br>
shown schematically in fig. 1. The crude oil, which has been<br>
obtained, for example, by pressing corresponding plant seeds in<br>
an oil mill, is, in the case of palm oil, firstly subjected to<br>
a drying and degassing in order to remove, for example,<br>
dissolved oxygen from the oil. The crude oil is passed to a<br>
degumming stage in which the gums, in particular phospholipids,<br>
are separated off. The degumming can involve a predegumming and<br>
an acid degumming. In the predegumming, water is added to the<br>
crude oil and the mixture is stirred at about 70 to 80°C at<br>
atmospheric pressure. The aqueous lecithin phase is then<br>
separated off. After the predegumming, the crude oil has a<br>
phosphorus content in the range from about 100-200 ppm. During<br>
the acid degumming, the predegummed oil is admixed with an acid<br>
and stirred at about 70 to 100°C at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Suitable acids are, for example, phosphoric acid and citric<br>
acid. Example conditions are an acid amount of 0.06% by weight<br>
of a 50% strength phosphoric acid, a treatment temperature of<br><br>
15<br>
about 95°C and a treatment time of about 15 minutes. At the end<br>
of the acid degumming, water may also be added, the amount of<br>
water chosen being about 0.2% by weight, in order to facilitate<br>
removal of the gums. The aqueous phase is then separated off,<br>
for example by a centrifugation. After the acid degumming, the<br>
oil has a phosphorus content in the range from about 10 to<br>
20 ppm. The degumming is required in order, in combination with<br>
the subsequent bleaching, to reduce the fraction of<br>
phospholipids (gums) and also metals present in the oil. If the<br>
degumming is omitted, then the contents of phosphorus and iron<br>
are too high even at sufficiently low Lovibond color numbers<br>
red/yellow in the refined oil. After the degumming, the oil<br>
can, if necessary, be dried and degassed. For low-phosphorus<br>
crude oils, such as, for example, palm oil, it is possible,<br>
where appropriate, to dispense with the acid degumming and to<br>
carry out the bleaching directly.<br>
The degumming is followed by a bleaching of the oil, where<br>
firstly a wet bleaching is carried out and then a vacuum<br>
bleaching. During the wet bleaching, the oil is admixed with<br>
water and bleaching earth, where amounts in the range from<br>
about 0.1 to 0.5% by weight for water and 0.3 to 2.0% by weight<br>
for bleaching earth are chosen. The oil is heated at<br>
atmospheric pressure to about 80 to 100°C and stirred for about<br>
20 minutes. A vacuum (for example 100 mbar) is then applied and<br>
the oil is stirred for a further 30 minutes at about 90 to 120°<br>
C. The oil is then filtered, for example over a suction filter<br>
covered with a paper filter. The filtration is carried out at a<br>
temperature of about 80°C.<br>
After the bleaching, the oil is deodorized. To this end,<br>
superheated steam, which has an exit temperature of about 240<br>
to 260°C, is passed through the oil in order to remove free<br>
fatty acids and unpleasant flavors and odors. The deodorization<br>
is carried out in vacuum at a pressure in the region of less<br>
than 5 mbar, preferably 1 to 3 mbar.<br>
After the refining, the oil has a phosphorus content of less<br>
than 3 ppm and an iron content of less than 0.1 ppm.<br><br>
16<br>
In the case of the method according to the invention, the<br>
refining of the crude oil is carried out in the manner<br>
described above, but using a specific clay product as adsorbing<br>
agent or bleaching agent, particularly during the bleaching.<br>
For oils which have a phosphorus content of less than about<br>
80 ppm, preferably less than 50 ppm, it is possible to dispense<br>
with the degumming step and, if appropriate, after drying and<br>
degassing the crude oil, to undertake a bleaching of the oil<br>
directly.<br>
Examples:<br>
The invention is further illustrated below by reference to<br>
examples.<br>
The following analytical methods were used:<br>
Surface/pore volume:<br>
The specific surface was carried out on a fully automated<br>
nitrogen porosimeter from Micromeritics, model ASAP 2010, in<br>
accordance with DIN 66131. The pore volume was determined using<br>
the BJH method (E.P. Barrett, L.G. Joyner, P.P. Haienda, J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 73 (1951) 373). Pore volumes of certain pore size<br>
ranges are determined by summing incremental pore volumes which<br>
are obtained from the evaluation of the adsorption isotherms<br>
according to the BJH method. The total pore volume in<br>
accordance with the BJH method refers to pores with a diameter<br>
of from 2 to 130 rati.<br>
Oil analysis:<br>
The color numbers in oils (Lovibond color numbers) were<br>
determined in accordance with AOCS Cc 13b-45. The chlorophyll A<br>
determination was carried out in accordance with AOCS Cc 13d-<br>
55.<br>
Water content:<br>
The water content of the products at 105°C was determined using<br>
the method DIN/ISO-787/2.<br>
Silicate analysis:<br><br>
17<br>
This analysis is based on the total digestion of the raw clay<br>
or the corresponding product. Following the dissolution of the<br>
solids, the individual components are analyzed and quantified<br>
using conventional specific analytical methods, such as, for<br>
example, ICP.<br>
Ion exchange capacity:<br>
To determine the ion exchange capacity (IUF), the raw clay to<br>
be investigated was dried over a period of two hours at 105°C.<br>
The dried material was then reacted under reflux with an excess<br>
of an aqueous 2N NH4C1 solution for one hour. After a standing<br>
time of 16 hours at room temperature, the mixture was filtered,<br>
and then the filter cake was washed, dried and ground and the<br>
NH4 content in the raw clay was ascertained by nitrogen<br>
determination (CHN analyzer from Leco) in accordance with the<br>
manufacturers instructions. The fraction and the nature of the<br>
exchanged metal ions was determined in the filtrate by ICP<br>
spectroscopy.<br>
X-rav diffractometry:<br>
The X-ray recordings are created on the high-resolution powder<br>
diffractometer from Phillips (X'-Pert-MPD(PW 3040)), which was<br>
equipped with a Cu anode.<br>
Determination of the sediment volume<br>
A graduated 100 ml measuring cylinder is filled with 100 ml of<br>
distilled water or an aqueous solution of 1% soda and 2%<br>
trisodium polyphosphate. 2 g of the substance to be measured<br>
are added slowly and in portions, in each case about 0.1 to<br>
0.2 g, using a spatula on to the surface of the water. After<br>
one added portion has sunk, the next portion is added. After<br>
the 2 g of substance have been added and have sunk to the<br>
bottom of the measuring cylinder, the cylinder is left to stand<br>
for one hour at room temperature. The height of the sediment<br>
volume is then read off in ml/2 g on the graduation of the<br>
measuring cylinder.<br><br>
18<br>
Determination of the volume increase of the sediment volume<br>
(swellability)<br>
The sample mixture used as described above for determining the<br>
sediment volume is sealed with Parafilm® and left to stand for<br>
three days at room temperature without vibration. The sediment<br>
volume is then read off on the graduation of the measuring<br>
cylinder. The increase in the sediment volume is the difference<br>
between the sediment volume at the start of the measurement and<br>
after a standing time of three days.<br>
Determination of the dry sieve residue<br>
About 50 g of the air-dry mineral to be investigated are<br>
weighed on to a sieve of mesh width 45 urn. The sieve is<br>
attached to a vacuum cleaner which, via a suction slit<br>
revolving below the base of the sieve, sucks out all of the<br>
fractions which are smaller than the sieve through the sieve.<br>
The sieve is covered with a plastic lid and the vacuum cleaner<br>
is switched on. After 5 minutes, the vacuum cleaner is switched<br>
off and the amount of relatively coarse fractions remaining on<br>
the sieve is determined by differential weighing.<br>
Loss on ignition:<br>
In an annealed weighed porcelain crucible with lid, about 1 g<br>
of dried sample is weighed in exactly to 0.1 mg and strongly<br>
heated for 2 h at 1000°C in a muffle furnace. The crucible is<br>
then cooled in the desiccator and weighed.<br>

Metal leaching-out in tartaric acid<br>
2.5 g of the clay material characterized in table I (air-dried)<br>
are weighed into a 250 ml measuring flask and this is topped up<br>
to the calibration mark with 1% strength tartaric acid<br>
solution. The measuring flask is left to stand for 24 hours at<br>
room temperature and then the flask contents are filtered<br>
through a fluted filter. In the filtrate, the values given in<br>
table II are determined by means of AAS. For comparison, the<br>
limiting values according to the German wine law are also<br>
included.<br>

The data show a very low metal leaching-out of the clay<br>
material. In particular, the clay material contains only very<br>
small amounts of heavy metals that can be leached out.<br>

Example 2<br>
Activation of the raw clay with sulfuric acid<br>
The raw clay characterized in example 1 was mixed with water<br>
and then activated with 3% by weight of H2S04. For this purpose,<br>
100 g of powder dried to 9.3% of H20 were intimately combined<br>
with 208 g of water and 2.83 g of H2SO„ (96% strength) in a<br><br>
21<br>
beaker. The resulting mixture was dried at 110°C to a water<br>
content of 9.4% and then ground to a typical bleaching earth<br>
fineness (dry sieve residue on 63 um sieve: 20 to 40% by weight;<br>
dry sieve residue on 25 um sieve: 50 to 65% by weight).<br>
Comparative example 1<br>

producing a bleaching earth according to US-A-5,008,22 6<br>
A naturally occurring acidic mixture of attapulgite and<br>
bentonite from Georgia was predried to 15 to 20% by weight of<br>
H20, ground by means of a rotor beating mill and then dried to a<br>
water content of 8% by weight. 100 g of the resulting powder<br>
were intimately combined with 309 g of water and 2.88 g of H2S04<br>
(96% strength) in a beaker. The resulting mixture was dried at<br>
110°C to a water content of 9% by weight and then ground to a<br>
typical bleaching earth fineness. (Dry sieve residue on 63 um<br>
sieve: 20 to 40% by weight; dry sieve residue on 25 um sieve:<br>

Reference bleaching earths according to the prior art<br>
As reference for the highest performance bleaching earths<br>
(HPBE) accessed by dealuminization with acid, the commercially<br>
available bleaching earths Tonsil Optimum 210 FF and Tonsil<br>
Supreme 110 FF (Siid-Chemie AG) were chosen. Both products are<br>
produced by dealuminization of montmorillonite clays with<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>

Example 3<br>
Bleaching of rapeseed oil and soybean oil<br>
A degummed and deacidified rapeseed oil or soybean oil was<br>
bleached with 0.30 or 0.73% by weight, respectively, of<br>
bleaching earth at 110°C or 100°C, respectively, for 30 minutes<br>
under a pressure of 30 mbar. The bleaching earth was then<br><br>
22<br>
filtered off and the color numbers of the oil were determined<br>
using the Lovibond method in a 5 V. Some of this oil was<br>
additionally deodorized by steam treatment (30 minutes, 240°C,<br>
of the Lovibond method. Tables IV and V give the results of the<br>
bleachings.<br>

As tables IV and V clearly show, an extraordinarily good<br>
decoloring of the oil (color number red and chlorophyll A) is<br>
achieved using the bleaching earth according to the invention<br>
in accordance with example 2. The values after the<br>
deodorization are of particular relevance here since in<br>
practice virtually all oils are deodorized after bleaching. The<br><br>
23<br>
cleaning performance of the bleaching earths according to the<br>
invention is in the region of or better than the highest<br>
performance bleaching earths and significantly above the<br>
results of the surface-modified bleaching earths according to<br>
the prior art.<br>

oils were used, the properties of which are summarized in<br>

The crude palm oils were refined in the following ways:<br>
a) Refining of palm oil A, with degumming:<br>
For the refining of palm oil A, the dried and degassed crude<br>
palm oil was firstly admixed with 0.06% by weight of H3PO4 (50%)<br>
and the mixture was stirred at 95°C for 15 minutes under<br>
atmospheric pressure. 0.2% of H20 were then added and the<br>
mixture was stirred for a further 10 min under atmospheric<br>
pressure. After the degumming, the oil was admixed with 2% by<br>
weight of each of the bleaching earths given in table V. The<br>
mixture was firstly stirred at atmospheric pressure for 20<br>
minutes at 95°C, then the pressure was lowered to 100 mbar and<br>
the mixture was stirred for a further 30 minutes at 95°C. After<br>
the bleaching, the oil was filtered at 80°C through a suction<br>
filter which was lined with a filter paper.<br>
The bleached oil was deodorized by passing, at a pressure of<br><br>
24<br>
temperature: 270°C) and then for a further 60 minutes,<br>
superheated steam (exit temperature: 240°C) through the oil.<br>
The refined oil was then characterized. The values are likewise<br>
given in table VII.<br>
b)	Refining of palm oil A, without degumming<br>
For the refining, the dried and degassed crude palm oil was<br>
admixed directly with 2.0% by weight of the bleaching earths<br>
given in table VII and the mixture was stirred at a pressure of<br>
100 mbar and a temperature of 95°C for 30 minutes. The mixture<br>
was then filtered and deodorized as stated in a). The values<br>
found for the refined palm oil are likewise given in table VII.<br>
c)	Refining of palm oil B, with degumming:<br>
Palm oil B was firstly degummed as stated in a) and then, for<br>
bleaching, admixed with 1.35% by weight of each of the<br>
bleaching earths given in table VII. The mixture was firstly<br>
stirred at 95°C for 20 minutes under atmospheric pressure. The<br>
temperature was then increased to 115°C and the mixture was<br>
stirred at a pressure of 100 mbar for a,further 25 minutes. The<br>
mixture was filtered at 80°C through a suction filter which was<br>
lined with a filter paper. The deodorization of the bleached<br>
oil was carried out by firstly passing steam, which had an exit<br>
temperature of 270°C, through the oil for 30 minutes, and then<br>
treating the oil for a further 60 minutes at a pressure of 
1 mbar with superheated steam which had an exit temperature of<br>
240°C. The refined oil was then characterized. The values are<br>
likewise given in table VII.<br>
d)	Refining of palm oil B, without degumming<br>
The dried and degassed palm oil B was admixed directly with<br>
1.35% by weight of bleaching earth and the mixture was stirred<br>
at 115CC for 25 minutes at 100 mbar. Following completion of<br>
the treatment, the oil was filtered at 80°C through a .suction<br>
filter which was lined with a filter paper. For the<br>
deodorization, superheated steam, which had an exit temperature<br>
of 270°C, was initially passed through the oil for 30 minutes.<br>
The deodorization was then continued by passing through<br><br>
25<br>
superheated steam, which had an exit temperature of 240°C, for<br>
a further 60 minutes at a pressure of 
refined perfume oils are given in table VII.<br><br><br><br>
27<br>
If the degumming is omitted, then even lower Lovibond color<br>
numbers are surprisingly obtained after deodorization than with<br>
degumming for all bleaching earths. With the exception of the<br>
examples in which the bleaching earth from example 2 was used,<br>
however, excessively high values for the content of phosphorus<br>
and iron in the oil are found. In the case of the oils bleached<br>
with the bleaching earth from example 2, both with and without<br>
degumming/wet bleaching, values for iron and phosphorus are<br>
found which are below the detection limit of 0.8 or 0.1 ppm. In<br>
the case of palm oil "B" it could be shown that a good refining<br>
result can also be achieved with a reduced dosing of 1.0% by<br>
weight.<br><br>
