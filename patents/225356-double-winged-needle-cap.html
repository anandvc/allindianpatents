				<td>Double Winged Needle Cap<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to needle cap more particularly double winged needle cap for the needle of Collapsible blood bags.<br>
Back ground of the invention and prior art<br>
Blood is collected from the donors in to sterile, flexible plastic bags containers, which is part of blood bag system. The donor bag generally contains an anticoagulant, which mixes with blood. The needle attached to the bag is needle for making vein puncture in the donor's arm. It is mandatory to maintain the sterile integrity of the needle used for the vein puncture. If the needle is contaminated it could be dangerous to the donor. And the contamination could be washed into the collected blood. The needle should operate with minimal discomfort to the donor.<br>
Needle caps are used widely during infusion, transfusion, extra corporeal blood circulation and the like. But the persons skilled in the<br>
art do not know the double winged cap explained in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The Blood bag and other blood transfusion devices as available<br>
presently are provided with a hub, a cannula and needle cover. During<br>
assembly of these components, the sharp edges of the cannula bevel<br>
touches needle cover and in that process gets damaged and resulting<br>
into the excessive pain to the donor or to the patient during blood<br>
collection   or  transfusion   as   the   case   may   be.   Some   of the<br>
manufactures offer needle cover that is open from the bevel end. If<br>
that   end   is   not   thoroughly   sealed,   it   may   lead  to   bacterial<br>
contamination.<br>
The main object of the present invention is that the chance of<br>
contamination of the needle and the blood is negligible.<br>
The other object of the double winged needle cap is that cap is easily removable by holding and twisting the wings. It is breakable at the rear end mounted on the hub portion.<br>
The present invention double winged needle cap provided for the needle of the collapsible bags is closed from the bevel end and it prevents the blunting of the needle tip and the contamination during usage.<br>
In the new invention, this double winged needle cap, has a configuration where the needle is attached to the front end of the hub, which is covered with a double wing shaped needle cap, and a blood collection tube is attached to the rear end of the hub. During infusion, the double winged shaped needle cap is removed by twisting and the needle is fastened on to the donor's or patients' arm or the like.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved needle cap which has cured all these draw backs. Further more needle assembly of the present invention provides maximum sterility of the needle surface. Thus the danger of contamination of the donor or the collected blood is minimized.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US Patent No 4435177: There is disclosed a needle assembly comprising a needle, a needle-retaining portion, a removable needle protector portion, and a resilient member for removing liquid from the surface of the needle which is disposed around the needle rearward of its point. The liquid removing member has a needle-accommodating opening with a diameter approximately that of the outside diameter of the needle. The member is contained within the needle protector portion and removable from the needle with the removal of the needle protector portion from the assembly. Also disclosed are blood bag<br>
systems comprising a donor bag and the afore mentioned needle assembly.<br>
US Patent No: 4091811: A needle cover for a blood collection needle or the like comprises a first sleeve positioned about a pointed hypodermic needle. The first sleeve is removably carried by a hub, which also carries the needle. In accordance with this invention an inner sleeve is provided, positioned within the first sleeve and about the point of the needle. The inner sleeve is free of mechanical attachment to the first sleeve so that, upon rotation of the outer sleeve for its removal from the hub, the inner sleeve does not rotate with the first sleeve. Accordingly, the danger of the pointed needle scouring out and retaining bits of plastic from the sleeve is eliminated.<br>
But our invention is a double wing shaped needle protection cap with stoppers, which is to protect the needle of the collapsible blood bag and prevent accidental locking. The needle is having a double wing shaped cover, which protects the needle inside from the damages and also from blunting the tip. It is made of medical grade material.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In the present invention, double wing shaped needle cap is sufficiently<br>
close to the needle which is as shown in the figure 1.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to maintain sterility to the needle and it is easy to take out the needle by twisting the double wing shaped needle cap. It has a pair of wings positioned at the two sides of the tube, which prevents the accidental locking. The front end of the hub is inserted into the inner bore of the tube of the double winged needle cap. It has a short neck where we can twist and break the double winged needle cap and take out the needle easily and safely. The needle is mounted on the front end of the hub in which the needle is attached with adhesives. This front end of the hub is inserted into the inner bore of the tube of the needle cap. The tip of the needle can be stored in the inner bore of the winged cap. The rear end of the hub is attached to the blood collection tube. The double winged cap is made of medically approved material and have flexibility. Additionally, two safety stoppers have been provided at the tip end of wings to prevent accidental locking.<br>
The inner diameter of the double winged needle cap is 1.9 to 2.1mm in the front portion and 2.8 to 3.1mm in the neck portion and 4.2 to 4.6 mm in the rear end of the cap. This will have a " double wing" shape at the outside and will be closed at front end.<br>
Description with figures<br>
Figure 1 denotes double winged needle cap (1) that is fixed to the<br>
front end of the hub. To the rear end of the hub (3), a blood collection<br>
tube (4) is connected. The needle (1) is covered with a novel double wing shaped needle cap (2) with stoppers (5), which is mounted on the front end of the hub. The hub is inserted into the rear end of the winged needle cap and the needle cap is having two wings in the left and right side. The wings are running in the 3/4th length of the cap leaving l/4th length at tip end. Two wings are symmetrical with each other.<br>
Figure 2 shows the view of the device before the needle is using. The neck portion at the rear end of the cap is twisted to remove the cap.<br>
Figure 3 shows the cross sectional view of the double winged needle cap.<br>
The soft needle cap is then slid over the needle taking care that the cannula bevel does not penetrate into the wall of the cap. The needle cap is then sealed air tight on to the hub with the help of adhesives taking the needle assembly ready for further use.<br><br><br><br>
I claim<br>
1.	A double wing shaped needle cap with stoppers provided on the<br>
wings to prevent it from accidental locking wherein the wings are<br>
symmetrical with each other; a tube for the collection of blood is<br>
attached to the rear end of the hub; to the front end of the hub, needle<br>
is  mounted;  the   double  winged  needle  cap   covers  the  needle<br>
thoroughly; which has dimensions conforming to the dimension of the<br>
needle and the hub to enable it to twist and remove easily and to<br>
