				<td>The present invention relates to a motorcycle in which a headlamp is mounted to a synthetic resin made handle cover for covering a handlebar with an optical axis of the headlamp adjustable and a pair of direction director lamps disposed on left and right sides of the headlamp are also mounted to the handle cover, and particularly to an improved headlamp supporting structure<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Japanese Patent No. 2767240 has disclosed a structure in which a handle cover includes a synthetic resin made lower cover for covering, from below, a handlebar, and a synthetic resin made upper cover for covering  from above, the handlebar, and a headlamp is mounted to the handle cover with its optical axis adjustable and a pair of left and right direction director lamps are also mounted to the handle cover.  In this structure, bearing portions for supporting, from below, supporting shafts provided on left and right sides<br><br>
of the headlamp are formed, into an approximately U-shape opened upwardly, on an upper end of a plate-like supporting portion integrally provided on the lower cover, and a projection provided on a lower portion of the headlamp is fastened to the lower cover in such a manner that a longitudinal position of the projection is adjustable.<br>
By the way, there has been also known a handle cover of a type including a synthetic resin made front cover for covering a handlebar from a front, and a synthetic resin made rear cover for covering, from rear, the handlebar, wherein a headlamp is mounted to the front cover with its optical axis adjustable and a pair of left and right direction director lamps are also mounted to the front cover.  In the case of adopting the above-described related art headlamp supporting structure for such a head cover, there may occur the following inconvenience: namely, the direction along a mold parting line of the front and rear covers molded from a synthetic resin is perpendicular to the movement direction of molds for forming the bearing portions for supporting, from below, the supporting shafts provided on left and right sides of the headlamp. As a result, slide molds must be used for forming the bearing portions at the time of<br><br>
moulding the handle cover; however, in this case, the production cost for the handle cover is raised.  For this reason, it has been expected to realize a headlamp supporting structure for a handle cover including a front cover and a rear cover without use of slide molds while preventing a shape of the handle cover from being complicated.<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide a headlamp supporting structure for a motorcycle in which a handle cover includes a front cover and a rear cover, which is improved so as to avoid the use of slide moulds ^t the time of mÂ©llldlnj the front cover and the rear cover, to simplify a shape of each of the front cover and the rear cover, and to swingably support a headlamp.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
To achieve the above object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided a headlamp supporting structure for a motorcycle.  In this motorcycle, a handle cover for covering a handlebar includes a synthetic resin made front cover for covering the handlebar from a front and a synthetic resin made rear cover for covering, from rear, the handlebar, and a<br><br>
headlamp is mounted on the front cover with its optical axis adjustable and a pair of direction director lamps disposed on left and right sides of the headlamp are also mounted to the front cover. The headlamp supporting structure is characterized in that a pair of first bearing half portions are provided on one of the front and rear covers, and a pair of second bearing half portions are provided on the direction director lamps; a pair of supporting shafts coaxially project from both sides of the headlamp; and each of the pair of supporting shafts is swingably supported by one of the pair of first bearing half portions and the corresponding one of the pair of second bearing half portions while being held in the longitudinal direction therebetween.<br>
With this configuration, each of the supporting shafts coaxially provided on the left and right sides of the headlamp is swingably supported by one of the pair of first bearing half portions and one of the second bearing half portions while being held in the longitudinal direction therebetween. Accordingly, the first bearing half portions provided on one of the front cover and the rear cover can be molded in the same direction as that of the mold parting line at the time of molding the one of the front cover and the rear cover. As a result, it is<br><br>
possible to eliminate the need of the use of slid molds for forming the first bearing half portions, and hence to reduce the production cost of the handle cover.  Further, since the first bearing half portions may be formed into simple shapes facing to the direction along the mold parting line, it is possible to simplify shapes of the front cover and the rear cover.<br>
According to a second feature of the present invention, in addition to the configuration of the first feature, a mounting portion for mounting each of the direction director lamps to the front cover and the second bearing half portion adjacent to the mounting portion project from an upper portion of the direction director lamp in such a manner as to be put in a row. With this configuration, since the direction director lamp is mounted to the front cover at a position near the second bearing half portion for supporting the rear half portion of the supporting shaft of the headlamp, it is possible to enhance a rigidity, for supporting the supporting shaft, of the second bearing half portion.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a headlamp supporting structure for a motorcycle in which a handle cover for covering a handlebar includes a synthetic resin made front cover for covering said handlebar from a front and a synthetic resin made rear cover for covering, from rear, said handlebar, and a headlamp is mounted on said front cover with its optical axis adjustable and a pair of direction director lamps disposed on left and right sides of said headlamp are also mounted to said front cover, said headlamp supporting structure being characterized in that a pair of first bearing half portions are provided on one of said front and rear covers, and a pair of second bearing half portions are ; provided on said direction director lamps; a pair of supporting shafts coaxially project from both sides of said headlamp; and each of said pair of supporting shafts is swingably supported by one of said pair of first bearing half portions and the corresponding one of said pair of second bearing half portions while being held in the longitudinal direction therebetween.<br>

A function of this embodiment will be described below. The pair of supporting shafts 51 coaxially provided on both the sides of the headlamp 46 are swingably supported by the pair of first bearing half<br><br>
portions 59 and the pair of second bearing half portions 60. The pair of first bearing half portions 59 are integrally provided on the front cover 39 in such a manner as to support the front half portions of the supporting shafts 51. The pair of second bearing half portions 60 are integrally provided on the lamp bodies 52 of the direction indicator lamps 47 mounted to the front cover 39 in such a manner as to support the rear half portions of the supporting shafts 51.<br>
Each of the supporting shafts 51 is swingably supported by one of the pair of first bearing half portions 59 and one of the second bearing half portions 60 while being held in the longitudinal direction therebetween.  Accordingly, the first bearing half portions 59 provided on the front cover 39 can be molded in the same direction as that of the mold parting line at the time of molding the front cover 39. As a result, it is possible to eliminate the need of the use of slid molds for forming the first bearing half portions 59, and hence to reduce the production cost of the handle cover 38. Further, since the first bearing half portions 59 may be formed into simple shapes facing to the direction of the mold parting line, it is possible to simplify shapes of the front and rear covers 39 and 40.<br><br>
since the mounting portion 55 for mounting the direction director lamp 47 to the front cover 39 and the second bearing half portion 60 adjacent to the mounting portion 55 project from the upper portion of each of the direction indicator lamps 47 in such a manner as to be put in a row, the direction director lamp 47 is mounted to the front cover 39 at a position near the second bearing half portion 60 for supporting the rear half portion of the supporting shaft 51 of the headlamp 46, it is possible to enhance a rigidity, for supporting the supporting shaft 51, of the second bearing half portion 60.<br>
