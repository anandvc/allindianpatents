				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to processes for the preparation of a processing aid for vinyl polymers, to processing aids prepared in accordance with the process of the invention and to polymer compositions comprising such processing aids.<br>
Soft PVC was relatively early in achieving a high stage of maturity in terms of stabilization and thermoplastic processing and has been regarded as a readily processible plastics material since the 1940s. This has been made possible by the use of plasticizers as an additive in the processing of soft PVC.<br>
The processing of high molecular weight hard PVC, which is commonly used in the production of plastics pipes, claddings, containers or profiles, has been associated with technical problems, however, especially on account of its thermal instability and its rheological behaviour. Those problems have to some extent been solved, however, by the addition of aids. For that reason, a ready-to-process hard PVC generally consists of a mixture of different components.<br>
Examples of aids added during the processing of hard PVC include stabilizers, lubricants and processing aids.<br>
The stabilizers, for example, serve to counteract the damage caused to metal parts of the processing apparatus through corrosion and rust resulting from the halogen content of the PVC polymers as well as to counteract the discoloration and decomposition of moulded PVC articles caused by heat or UV radiation.<br>
The main purpose of lubricants, however, is often to improve the flow behaviour of highly viscous PVC melts during shaping and plasticization in the various processing apparatuses, a distinction being drawn between "internal" lubricants and "external" lubricants. "External" lubricants provide a lubricating film between the plastics melt and the metal surfaces of the processing apparatus. Such a<br><br>
lubricating film reduces the adhesion of the individual polymer particles to the metal surfaces. In this way, it is possible to counteract degradation of the PVC caused by the rise in polymer temperatures resulting from friction between the polymer particles and the metal surfaces. "Internal" lubricants reduce the friction between polymer particles within the polymer melt and thus bring about a reduction in the effective viscosity of the polymer melt. In addition, the use of such "internal" lubricants can reduce frictional heat caused by friction between the polymer particles, which likewise has an adverse effect on the properties of the PVC.<br>
As lubricants there are customarily used fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid amides, fats, ester waxes, acid waxes, paraffin oils, paraffin waxes or oxidised or non-oxidised polyethylene waxes.<br>
The main purpose of processing aids, in addition to reducing the duration of the softening operation, is primarily to improve the rheological properties in the thermoplastic state and in the thermoelastic state. The processing aids, which are generally of high molecular weight, are also known as flow aids.<br>
As processing aids there are customarily used copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) with other methacrylic and acrylic acid derivatives, especially esters, or polymers based on acrylonitrile, styrene, a-methylstyrene or vinyltoluene.<br>
For example, DE 42 20 453 A1 describes a thermoplastic composition which comprises as processing aid a copolymer based on a monomer the homopolymer of which has a glass transition temperature of &gt; 65Â°C, and on a comonomer having a Cg-C22alkyl component.<br>
DE 199 14 605 Al describes a copolymer used as a flow aid in the production of a plastisol, the copolymer consisting of from 0 to 90 % by weight alkyl acrylates having at least 2 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and/or styrene, from 10 to 99 % by weight methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or ethyl acrylate, from 1 to 20 %<br><br>
by weight of a hydrophilic compound in the form of an acrylic acid derivative, and from 0.01 to 1 % by weight of a crosslinking agent.<br>
DE 40 35 491 describes a processing aid in the form of an alkyl methacrylate copolymer having an average (weight average) molecular weight in the range of from 2,000 to 
The polymeric processing aids described in the prior art mentioned above are usually obtained by solution polymerisation, suspension polymerisation or emulsion polymerisation. Before they are added as processing aids to the thermoplastic vinyl polymers, however, the polymers have to undergo a time-consuming and expensive drying step, which in the case of emulsion polymerisation, for example, is carried out by spray-drying.<br>
DE 21 23 384 describes a process for producing non-adhesive vinyl chloride homopolymers or copolymers in which a mixture of a polymeric acrylic ester with C^Csalcohols, a lubricant or a lubricant mixture and/or a proportion of acrylo-nitrile is added as additive to a vinyl chloride monomer mixture or to a vinyl chloride homopolymer or copolymer. The polymeric acrylic ester is obtained by polymerisation in the molten lubricant or by polymerisation in an aqueous emulsion. The polymeric acrylic esters described in DE 21 23 384 are added in molten or dissolved form to a PVC suspension. A disadvantage of the poly-acrylates described in that document is, however, that the alcohols having a chain length &gt; C4 are partly incompatible with thermoplastic hard PVC. Furthermore, the described polymer/lubricant mixtures bring about a reduction in friction between the polymer molecules or between polymer molecules and processing apparatus, which is not desirable in the context of the present invention, however.<br>
When halogenated polymers are being processed, however, for the purpose of better intermixing and plasticization of the polymer mass being processed it is often necessary or desirable, even in the presence of an internal lubricant, to bring<br><br>
about friction between the polymer molecules themselves or between the polymer mass and the walls or moving parts of the processing apparatus.<br>
DE 20 27 124 Al likewise relates to a process for producing non-adhesive vinyl chloride homopolymers or copolymers and moulded articles or mouldings produced therefrom. As additives there are used in this case too mixtures of a polymeric acrylic ester with C^Cgalcohols in the alcohol radical, lubricants or a lubricant mixture and a proportion of acrylonitrile.<br>
The aim of the present invention was therefore to overcome the disadvantages arising from the prior art.<br>
The present invention was based especially on the problem of providing a process for processing thermoplastic compositions based on vinyl polymers in which processing aids can be used in the form of polyacrylates, which have satisfactory compatibility especially with PVC, without prior drying steps for the thermoplastic composition.<br>
The invention was also based on the problem of providing a processing aid which, in addition to comprising a meltable additive, for example a lubricant or a plasticizer, comprises a processing aid which can be added to the vinyl polymers in a simple way, for example in the form of particles.<br>
The problems underlying the invention are solved by processing aids for vinyl polymers, processes for the preparation thereof and polymer compositions, as described in the context of the following text.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of a processing aid for vinyl polymers, in which,a reaction mixture, Â«at4easfc comprising a (meth)acrylate monomer having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical or'a monomer mixture, at least ^omprising)a (meth)acrylate monomer having from I to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical, and a meltable additive or a mixture of two or more meltable additives for vinyl polymers, the meltable additive or the<br><br>
mixture of two or more meltable additives being present in a softened state, preferably in a liquid state, under polymerization conditions, but especially having a softening temperature of more than 35Â°C, is free-radical-polymerized to form a reaction product at a temperature above the softening temperature of the plasticizer or the mixture of two or more plasticizers.<br>
The term "(meth)acrylate" is used in the context of this text as a synonym for esters both of methacrylic acid and of acrylic acid, unless expressly indicated to the contrary.<br>
The processing aids for vinyl polymers described in the context of this text are in principle processing aids that are suitable for use for substantially all kinds of vinyl polymers, "vinyl polymers" being understood as meaning polymers that are obtainable by polymerization of compounds having at least one olefinically unsaturated double bond.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "vinyl polymers" is preferably to be understood as meaning polymers that have been obtained with the participation of at least one monomer that has at least one halogen atom.<br>
"Vinyl polymers" in the context of the present invention are, for example, polymers selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl chloride, polymers of vinyl acetate, vinyl acetate/vinyl chloride copolymers, polymers of vinylidene halides, such as, for example, vinylidene chloride, vinyl pyridine, vinyl carbazole, styrene, vinyl benzene, polymers of acrylic acid esters, such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, or methyl methacrylate, or polymers of acrylonitrile. Especially preferred vinyl polymers are homopolymers of vinyl chloride and copolymers and terpolymers of vinyl chloride with further comonomers, such as, for example, vinyl acetate, vinyl formate, alkyl vinyl ethers, ethylene, propylene, butylene, vinylidene chloride, alkyl acrylates, alkyl methacrylates, maleic acid alkyl esters and fumaric acid alkyl esters. It is also preferred for at least 50 % by weight, especially at least 75 % by weight and furthermore preferably more than 90 % by<br><br>
weight, especially substantially 100 % by weight, of a vinyl polymer to be based on vinyl chloride monomers, in each case based on the weight of the vinyl polymer. The term "vinyl polymers" includes in the context of the present invention also physical mixtures of two or more different vinyl polymers, so-called blends.<br>
For the preparation of a processing aid for vinyl polymers according to the invention, a reaction mixture, at least comprising a (meth)acrylate monomer * having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical or a monomer mixture, at least comprising a (meth)acrylate monomer having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical, and a meltable additive or a mixture of two or more meltable additives for vinyl polymers is polymerized to form a reaction product, the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives being in a softened state, preferably in a liquid state, under polymerization conditions.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives has a softening temperature of more than 35Â°C. The polymerization is effected preferably at a temperature above the softening temperature of the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives, for example at a temperature of at least 80Â°C.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a "meltable additive" is to be understood as being in principle any additive that in admixture with vinyl polymers brings about a change in the properties of those vinyl polymers. For example, such "meltable additives" are plasticizers or lubricants. Further suitable "meltable additives" in the context of this text are mentioned, for example, in the list of suitable additional ingredients. Such meltable additives are especially compounds that have a positive effect on the processibility or the stability of vinyl polymers so treated.<br><br>
A reaction mixture according to the invention comprises at least two components having different functionality. A first component, which may consist of one or more different constituents, comprises compounds having at least one olefinically unsaturated, free-radical-polymerizable double bond. Such a component is also termed the "monomer component" in the context of this text.<br>
As at least one further component, a reaction mixture used in a process according to the invention also comprises at least one meltable additive or a mixture of two or more meltable additives, which in molten form serves as solvent in the polymerization of the monomer component.<br>
For the preparation of a processing aid according to the invention there are suitable in principle those reaction mixtures which comprise as constituent of the monomer component at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate and propyl methacrylate. Also suitable according to the invention, however, are those reaction mixtures which comprise a mixture of two or more of the above-mentioned monomers.<br>
The proportion of compounds from the group of (meth)acrylate esters having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical in the monomer component is, in the context of the present invention, from about 0.1 to about 100 % by weight, for example from about 1 to about 99 % by weight or from about 5 to about 98 % by weight. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the proportion of compounds from the group of (meth)acrylate esters having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical in the monomer component is more than about 30 % by weight, especially more than about 40 % by weight or more than about 60 % by weight.<br>
In addition to comprising a compound or a mixture of two or more compounds from the group of (meth)acrylate esters having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical, in the context of the process according to the invention a<br><br>
monomer component may also comprise a further monomer or a mixture of two or more further monomers.<br>
Suitable further monomers likewise have, in principle, a free-radical-polymeriz-able, olefinically unsaturated double bond and can be co-polymerized alternately, randomly or blockwise preferably with compounds from the group of (meth)-acrylate esters having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical in the monomer component.<br>
In principle, as further monomers there are suitable, for example, the esters of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, a-chloroacrylic acid, a-cyano-acrylic acid, p-methylacrylic acid (crotonic acid), a-phenylacrylic acid, p-acryloxypropionic acid, sorbic acid, a-chlorosorbic acid, 2,-methylisocrotonic acid, cinnamic acid, p-chlorocinnamic acid, p-stearylic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, aconitic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tricarboxylethylene and maleic anhydride, the alcohol radical of the ester having from 1 to 24 carbon atoms. Of course, the compounds from the group of (meth)acrylate esters having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alcohol radical that are already necessarily present in the monomer component are excepted. Also suitable as further monomers are, for example, styrene and styrene derivatives, vinyl acetate and the like.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the monomer component used in the context of the process according to the invention comprises esters of acrylic acid or esters of methacrylic acid having 4 or more carbon atoms, for example from 4 to about 12 carbon atoms, in the alcohol radical. According to the invention it is especially preferred for the monomer component to have a content of butyl acrylate or butyl methacrylate or pentyl acrylate or pentyl methacrylate or hexyl acrylate or hexyl methacrylate or heptyl acrylate or heptyl methacrylate or octyl acrylate or octyl methacrylate or a mixture of two or more of the mentioned compounds. The alkyl radicals in the alcohol radical can be in the form of linear or branched radicals.<br><br>
Within the scope of a further embodiment of the present invention, the monomer component comprises an amount of methyl methacrylate such that the resulting polymer is based on at least 50 % by weight, preferably at least 75 % by weight, especially at least 90 % by weight and furthermore preferably 100 % by weight, methyl (meth)acrylate, based on the weight of the resulting polymer. In a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, there is used as monomer component a mixture of methyl methacrylate and n-butyl (meth)acrylate in a ratio by weight of methyl methacrylate : n-butyl (meth)acrylate in a range of from 10 : 1 to 1 : 5, for example in a range of from 5 :1 to 2 : 1.<br>
Preferably, therefore, a monomer mixture as used in the context of the present invention contains at least 50 % by weight methyl (meth)acrylate.<br>
In addition to the monomer component, a reaction mixture used in the context of a process according to the invention also comprises a further component, namely a meltable additive or a mixture of two or more meltable additives that in the molten state serves as solvent for the polymerization. Such a component, also referred to as the "solvent component" in the context of this text, is present under the polymerization conditions that prevail in the context of the present invention in a state of aggregation that facilitates polymerization of the free-radical-polymerizable monomers. The solvent component is therefore present under the conditions prevailing in the polymerization at least in a softened state, but preferably in a liquid state. A solvent mixture in accordance with the present invention can therefore be a meltable additive or a mixture of two or more meltable additives that are present in a softened or liquid state at room temperature (23Â°C).<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, however, the solvent component has a melting point of from at least about 25Â°C, but preferably at least about 30Â°C, to about 150Â°C, for example from about 40 to about 110Â°C. When the solvent component used in the context of the process<br><br>
according to the invention does not have a clearly defined melting point, the above-mentioned temperatures apply to a corresponding softening point.<br>
It is possible for the solvent component to contain only one compound but it is also possible within the scope of the present invention for the solvent component to comprise two or more compounds as constituents. When the solvent component comprises two or more compounds, it is unnecessary for all the compounds contained in the solvent component to have a melting point within the above-mentioned range. It is sufficient for the solvent component as a whole to have a melting point or a softening point within the above-mentioned range.<br>
In principle, in the context of the present invention there is suitable as solvent component or as a constituent of the solvent component any compound that results in the solvent component having a suitable melting range and that, furthermore, is substantially inert towards the conditions prevailing during free-radical polymerization, that is to say that does not completely suppress the course of polymerization or has no effect or no appreciable effect thereon.<br>
It has been found in the context of the present invention that there are suitable as solvent component or at least as a constituent of the solvent component especially any compounds customarily used as "lubricant" or "plasticizer" in the processing of halogenated polymers.<br>
Suitable lubricants are, for example, paraffin waxes, polyethylene waxes, polypropylene waxes, montan waxes, ester lubricants, such as fatty acid esters, purified or hydrogenated natural or synthetic triglycerides or partial esters, amide waxes, chloroparaffins, glycerol esters or alkaline earth soaps.

The term "lubricant" also includes those compounds which, with a view to the properties of a composition comprising vinyl polymers, exhibit in addition to the property of improving anti-friction properties also a further or two or more further property-modifying functions.<br>

The polyethylenes preferably have a density in accordance with ASTM D-1505 of from 0.85 to 1.05, especially from 0.98 to 1.05. The polyethylenes preferably have a Brookfield viscosity at a temperature of 150Â°C in a range of from 100 to 100,000 centipoise, especially in a range of from 1,000 to 85,000 centipoise.<br>
In the context of the process according to the invention, the addition of the monomer or the monomer mixture of two or more monomers is preferably effected successively in a ratio by volume of from 1:500 to 1:50, based on the volume of the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives, per minute during the reaction period.<br>
In the context of the volumetric addition of monomer or monomer mixture "per minute during the reaction period", based on the volume of the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives, there should be added per<br><br>
0.2 % by volume (based on the volume of the additive) of monomer or monomer mixture.<br>
For example, in the case of 100 ml of a meltable additive, preferably a maximum of 2 ml per minute and at least 0.2 ml per minute of monomer or monomer mixture (based on the volume of additive) should therefore be added.<br>
Preferably the reaction mixture used in the context of the process according to the invention has a ratio by weight of monomer component: solvent component in a range of from about 1 : 10 to about 10:1, especially in a range of from about 1 : 5 to about 5 : 1 and furthermore preferably in a range of from about 1 : 2 to about 2 : 1, for example from about 1.5 : 1 to about 1 : 1.5.<br>
Within the scope of a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, the solvent component comprises at least two, but preferably three or more constituents. It is especially preferred for the solvent component to comprise at least one triglyceride, preferably at least one saturated triglyceride. Within the scope of a further preferred embodiment, a solvent component used in a process of the invention comprises at least one oxidised polyethylene wax or at least one polyethylene wax, but preferably both.<br>
Within the scope of a further embodiment of the present invention, a solvent component used according to the invention contains from about 30 to about 70 % by weight of a triglyceride and from about 30 to about 70 % by weight of a polyethylene wax or a mixture of two or more polyethylene waxes.<br>
Within the scope of a further embodiment of the present invention there is used as solvent component, for example, a mixture of a triglyceride, especially beef tallow, a non-oxidised polyethylene wax and an oxidised polyethylene wax.<br>
For the preparation of a processing aid in accordance with a process of the invention, a reaction mixture which comprises at least the above-described solvent<br><br>
component and the above-described monomer component is subjected to polymerization, the monomer component being polymerized so as to yield as reaction product a mixture of solvent component and one or more polymers, as are obtainable by polymerization of the monomer component.<br>
The process according to the invention can in principle be carried out in any desired way, provided that there is obtained as reaction product the desired mixture of one or more polymers and a solvent component, as described in the context of this text.<br>
For example, in the context of the process of the invention, a stabilizer for vinyl polymers can be added to the reaction mixture before or during polymerization or to the reaction product.<br>
Preferably the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives is in a liquid state under polymerization conditions.<br>
One possible method of carrying out the process according to the invention comprises, for example, in a first step melting the solvent component at a temperature above the melting point or the softerning point of the solvent component, preferably under an inert gas atmosphere, especially under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, in a second step, the monomer component and one or more polymerization initiators are added to the molten solvent component, with the result that the polymerization of the monomer component takes place.<br>
Preferably, the meltable additive or the mixture of two or more meltable additives has a melting point of at least 30Â°C.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention it is possible first to mix together solvent component and monomer component and then to add the polymerization initiator or the mixture of two or more polymerization initiators. It is equally possible,  however,   first  to  mix  together  the  solvent  component   and  the<br><br>
polymerization initiator or the mixture of two or more polymerization initiators and then to add the monomer component.<br>
Within the scope of the process according to the invention the addition of the monomer component can in principle be effected in any desired way. For example, all of the monomer component can be added to the reaction mixture within a short period of time. It is preferred, however, within the scope of the present invention for the monomer component to be added to the reaction mixture over a longer period of time, for example over a period of from about 1 min to about 5 hours, especially over a period of from about 2 min to about 60 min, batchwise or preferably continuously, for example with addition of a static amount or with addition of an amount that varies in accordance with a gradient.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, first a melt of the solvent component is prepared and then the monomer component together with the polymerization initiator is continuously added dropwise over a relatively long period of time, for example over a period of from about 5 to about 30 minutes, it having proved advantageous to dissolve or disperse the polymerization initiator in the monomer component. It is thus ensured that the reaction mixture is supplied with an unvarying concentration of monomer component and polymerization initiator.<br>
As initiators for initiating the polymerization there may be used any initiators that form free radicals under the polymerization conditions. Initiation of polymerization by the action of electron beams on the polymerizable mixture is also possible. The polymerization can, however, also be initiated in the absence of initiators of the above-mentioned kind by the action of high-energy radiation in the presence of photoinitiators. As initiators there come into consideration all compounds known to the person skilled in the art that decompose to form free radicals. They include especially peroxides, hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, persulfates, azo compounds and also so-called redox catalysts. In some cases it is advantageous to use mixtures of different polymerization initiators. Of such<br><br>
mixtures, preference is given to those of hydrogen peroxide and sodium or potassium peroxodisulfate, which can be used in any feasible quantity ratio. Suitable organic peroxides are especially acetylacetone peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide,  cumene hydroperoxide,  tert-amyl perpivalate,    tert-butyl    perpivalate,    tert-butyl    perneohexonate,    tert-butyl isobutyrate, tert-butyl per-2-ethyl hexenoate, tert-butyl perisononanoate, tert-butyl permaleate, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-amyl perpivalate, tert-butyl perpivalate, tert-butyl perneohexonate, tert-butyl isobutyrate, tert-butyl per-2-ethyl hexenoate, tert-butyl perisononanoate, tert-butyl permaleate, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl-3,5,5-trimethylhexanoate and amyl perneodecanoate and amyl perneo-decanoate. Also preferred as polymerization initiators: azo compounds, such as 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride, azo-bis-amidinopropane-dihydro-chloride,    2,2'-azobis(N,N-dimethylene)isobutyramidine    dihydrochloride,    2-(carbamoylazo)isobutyronitrile and 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid).  The said compounds are used in customary amounts, preferably in a range of from 0.01 to 5 mol %, especially from 0.1 to 2 mol %, in each case based on the amount of monomer being polymerized.<br>
The redox catalysts comprise as oxidic component at least one of the above-mentioned per compounds and as reducing component preferably ascorbic acid, glucose, sorbose, mannose, ammonium or alkali metal hydrogen sulfite, sulfate, thiosulfate, hyposulfite or sulfide, metal salts, such as iron(II) ions or silver ions or sodium hydroxymethylsulfoxylate. As the reducing component of the redox catalyst there is preferably used ascorbic acid or sodium pyrosulfite. Based on the amount of monomer used in the polymerization, there is used from lxlO"5 to 1 mol % of the reducing component of the redox catalyst and from lxlO"5 to 5 mol % of the oxidising component of the redox catalyst. Instead of the oxidising component of the redox catalyst, or in addition thereto, it is possible to use one or more azo compounds.<br>
When the polymerization is initiated by the action of high-energy radiation, there are usually used as initiators so-called photoinitiators. These may be, for example,<br><br>
so-called a-cleaving agents, H-abstracting systems or azides. Examples of such initiators are benzophenone derivatives, such as Michler's ketone, phenanthrene derivatives, fluorene derivatives, anthraquinone derivatives, thioxanthone derivatives, coumarin derivatives, benzoin ethers and derivatives thereof, azo compounds such as the above-mentioned free-radical-formers, substituted hexaaryl-bisimidazoles or acylphosphine oxides. Examples of azides are: 2-(N,N-dimethyl-amino)-ethyl-4-azidocinnamate, 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-ethyl-4-azidonaphthyl ketone, 2-(N?N-dimethylamino)-ethyl-4-azidobenzoate, 5-azido-1 -naphthyl-21-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethylsulfone, N-(4-sulfonylazidophenyl)maleinimide, N-acetyl-4-sulfonylazidoaniline, 4-sulfonylazidoaniline, 4-azidoaniline, 4-azidophenacyl bromide, p-azidobenzoic acid, 2,6-bis(p-azidobenzylidene)-cyclohexanone and 2,6-bis(p-azidobenzylidene)-4-methylcyclohexanone. The photoinitiators, if used, are usually employed in amounts of from 0.01 to 5 % by weight, based on the monomers being polymerized.<br>
According to the invention there are preferably used as initiators dibenzoyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, tert-butyl peroxyacetate, 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, di-(3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl) peroxide and tert-butyl-(3,5,5-trimethyl-hexanoyl) peroxide.<br>
The degree of polymerization and thus the molecular weight of the processing aid can be set by known methods, such as, for example, by the ratio of initiators to monomers or by the addition of regulators in the form of chain transfer agents. Preferred chain transfer agents are chlorinated hydrocarbons and aliphatic mercaptans, such as, for example, mercaptoethanol, mercaptopropanol, n-butylmercaptan, n-dodecylmercaptan, tert-dodecylmercaptan and thioglycolic acid 2-ethylhexyl ester.<br>
After the polymerization, any monomers still present in the reaction mixture can be driven out of the reaction mixture by a stream of gas, preferably by a stream of nitrogen.<br><br>
The polymers obtained by polymerization of tne above-described monomer component in the molten solvent component preferably have at least one, especially all, of the following properties:<br>
a)	a weight average of the molecular weight (Mw) in a range of from 1 x 102 to 5xl06 g/mol (measured with GPC against a polystyrene standard);<br>
b)	a particle size in a range of from 100 to 1,000 nm (measured with a Malvern Particle Sizer).<br>
A polymer produced in accordance with the invention can be so adjusted, for example, that it has a broad or narrow molecular weight distribution in a molecular weight range Mw of from about 1.2 to about 3.8 x 105 g/mol (viscosity number (VN) from about 50 to about 130 cm3/g) or a broad or narrow molecular weight distribution in a molecular weight range Mw of from about 3.8 x 105 to about 1.3 x 106 g/mol (VN from about 150 to about 330cm3/g) or a broad or narrow molecular weight distribution in a molecular weight range Mw of from about 1.3 x 106 to about 5.0 x 106 g/mol (VN from about 330 to about 1200 cm3/g).<br>
A polymer produced in accordance with the invention can furthermore have a monomodal, bimodal or trimodal or higher modal molecular weight distribution. Such bimodal, trimodal or higher modal molecular weight distributions can be obtained, for example, by modifying the polymerization reaction itself or by mixing together polymers of different molecular weight or different molecular weight distribution.<br>
In a further process step, the processing aid so obtained can be cooled, for example, to room temperature. Should a solid composition be formed under those conditions, which is usually the case when the melting point of the solvent component is above room temperature, the solid composition can be converted into a particulate form, for example by comminution, for example by grinding, the nrocessine aid beins so comminuted, for examnle. that its narticle size, deter-<br><br>
mined by screen analysis, is in a range of from 1 to 2,000 fim, for example in a range of from 5 to 1,000 (xm. The processing aids obtained in accordance with a process of the invention can also be processed, for example, from the molten form to give granules, prills or pastilles.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, the processing aids prepared in accordance with the process of the invention can consist, for example, solely of the polymer obtained from the monomer component and the solvent component. It is also possible, however, within the scope of the present invention to use the process of the invention to prepare processing aids that comprise further additional ingredients customarily used for the stabilization of polymer compositions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention there are therefore prepared processing aids that comprise further additional ingredients, especially stabilizers, such as metal-containing stabilizers, organophosphites, acid absorbers, such as hydrotalcite, antioxidants, UV- or IR-absorbers or mixtures of at least two thereof.

Likewise suitable for treatment with the processing aids according to the invention are mixtures of halogenated and non-halogenated polymers, for example mixtures of the above-mentioned non-halogenated polymers with PVC, especially mixtures of polyurethanes and PVC.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is also possible for recyclates of chlorine-containing polymers to be treated with the processing aids according to the invention, in principle any recyclates of the above-mentioned halogenated polymers being suitable for this purpose. PVC recyclate, for example, is suitable in the context of the present invention.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer composition according to the invention comprises the processing aid according to the invention in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 phr, especially from about 0.5 to about 15 phr or from about 1 to about 12 phr. The unit phr represents "per hundred resin" and thus relates to parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer.<br>
As already mentioned above, the processing aids according to the invention are also suitable for the stabilization of polymer compositions, especially for the stabilization of polymer compositions comprising halogen-containing polymers, depending upon the nature and the amount of the additional ingredients contained therein.<br>
The present invention therefore relates also to a process for stabilizing halogen-containing polymers in which a halogen-containing polymer or a mixture of two or more halogen-containing polymers or a mixture of one or more halogen-containing polymers and one or more halogen-free polymers is mixed with a processing aid according to the invention.<br>
The mixing together of polymer or polymers and the processing aid according to the invention can in principle be effected at any time before or during the production or processing of the polymer. For example, the processing aid can be mixed into the pulverulent polymer prior to processing. It is equally possible, however, to add the processing aid to the polymer or polymers in the softened or molten state. Furthermore, the processing aid can be added as early as during the polymerization of the vinyl polymer or immediately after the polymerization of<br><br>
the vinyl polymer, for example during the polymerization of PVC or immediately after the polymerization of PVC, e.g. to give a hot S-PVC slurry.<br>
In the context of a process according to the invention for the production of a polymer composition according to the invention, for example, a polymer composition is mixed with a processing aid according to the invention.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, a polymer composition according to the invention can comprise a vinyl polymer or a mixture of two or more vinyl polymers, preferably halogenated vinyl polymers, a mixture of polymers and solvent component prepared in accordance with a process of the invention, and also further additional ingredients, for example additional ingredients as already described in the context of this test. Within the scope of the present invention, the additional ingredients may have been introduced into the polymer composition by means of the processing aid according to the invention or the additional ingredients may have been mixed with the polymer composition and the processing aid in one or more separate steps. It is also possible, for example, for some of the desired additional ingredients to be introduced into the polymer composition by means of the processing aid and for a further portion of the additional ingredients to be mixed with the polymer composition and the processing aid in one or more separate steps.<br>
In the context of a process according to the invention, one or more additional ingredients can be added to the polymer composition in addition to the processing aid.<br>
The processing aid is preferably added to the polymer composition in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 % by weight, based on the polymer contained in the polymer composition.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, special preference is given to a process in which at least 50 % by weight of the vinyl polymer is vinyl-chloride-based.<br><br>
A polymer composition according to the invention can be brought into a desired form in known manner. Suitable processes are, for example, calendering, extrusion, injection-moulding, sintering, extrusion blowing or the plastisol process. A polymer composition according to the invention can also be used, for example, in the production of foamed materials. In principle, the polymer compositions according to the invention are suitable for the production of hard or soft PVC, especially for the production of PVC-U.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention can be processed to form moulded articles. The present invention therefore relates also to moulded articles, at least comprising a processing aid according to the invention or a polymer composition according to the invention.<br>
The term "moulded article" in the context of the present invention in principle includes any three-dimensional structures that can be produced from a polymer composition according to the invention. In the context of the present invention the term "moulded article" includes, for example, wire sheathings, automobile components, for example automobile components such as are used in the interior of the automobile, in the engine space or on the outer surfaces, cable insulations, decorative films, agricultural films, hoses, shaped sealing elements, office films, hollow bodies (bottles), packaging films, (deep-draw films), blown films, tubes, foamed materials, heavy duty profiles (window frames), light wall profiles, structural profiles, sidings, fittings, plates, foamed panels, co-extrudates having a recycled core, or housings for electrical apparatus or machinery, for example computers or household appliances.<br>
Further examples of moulded articles that can be produced from a polymer composition according to the invention are synthetic leather, floor coverings, textile coatings, wallcoverings, coil coatings and underseals for motor vehicles.<br><br>
The present invention relates also to the use of a processing aid according to the invention as an additive in the processing of a thermoplastic composition based on vinyl polymers.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with reference to test methods and non-limiting Examples.<br>
TEST METHODS<br>
DETERMINATION OF THE SOFTENING TIME<br>
The determination is carried out on a Brabender measuring kneader at a temperature of 170Â°C. 34 g of the thermoplastic moulding material were used for determining the softening time.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
PREPARATION OF THE ADDITIVES<br>
Example 1:<br>
150 g of beef tallow, 60 g of polyethylene wax, 45 g of oxidised polyethylene wax (in total a mixture of Baerolub GTS, Baerolub PA and Baerolub PA25) are weighed into a 1.4 litre steel reactor equipped with an oil bath thermostat, an anchor stirrer and a reflux condenser. The mixture is then melted under nitrogen at 100Â°C and mixed with the anchor stirrer at 100 rev/min. To the resulting solution there is added dropwise by means of a metering pump a mixture of 300 g of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 1.3 g of dibenzoyl peroxide. The throughflow rate of the pump is adjusted to 2.5 ml per minute. When the addition of MMA is complete, stirring is carried out for a further one hour at 100Â°C. Any residual monomer still present is driven out of the mixture by a stream of nitrogen.<br>
Examples 2 to 5:<br>
The procedure is analogous to Example 1, the reaction temperatures being varied<br>
between 110Â°C and 150Â°C.<br><br>
Example 6:<br>
The procedure is analogous to Example 1, the throughflow rate of the pump being<br>
set to 0.5 ml per minute.<br>
Example 7:<br>
The procedure is analogous to Example 1, a mixture of 80 parts by weight methyl<br>
methacrylate and 20 parts by weight n-butyl acrylate being used as monomer.<br>
Example 8:<br>
The procedure is analogous to Example 1, a mixture of 80 parts by weight methyl<br>
methacrylate and 20 parts by weight n-butyl methacrylate being used as monomer.<br>
Example 9:<br>
150 g of beef tallow, 60 g of polyethylene wax and 45 g of oxidised polyethylene wax (see above) are weighed into a 1.4 litre steel reactor equipped with an oil bath thermostat, an anchor stirrer and a reflux condenser. The mixture is then melted under nitrogen at 130Â°C and mixed with the anchor stirrer at 100 rev/min. To the resulting solution there are added dropwise by means of a metering pump a first mixture of 198 g of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 1.3 g of dibenzoyl peroxide and then a second mixture of 42 g of MMA, 60 g of n-butyl acrylate and 0.5 g of dibenzoyl peroxide. The throughflow rate of the pump is adjusted to 2.5 ml per minute. When the addition of MMA is complete, stirring is carried out for a further one hour at 130Â°C. Any residual monomer still present is driven out of the mixture by a stream of nitrogen.<br>
PREPARATION OF A STABILIZER COMPOSITION<br>
Example 11:<br>
The following further stabilizers were added to the product of Example 6 while<br>
still in the molten state in the reaction vessel:<br>
p-diketone (calcium acetylacetonate)	60 g<br>
BSASM1041	60 g<br><br>
antioxidant2	42 g<br>
hydrotalcite as inorg. acid absorber	150 g<br>
zinc stearate	300 g<br>
organophosphite	30 g<br>
1	= trihydroxyethyl isocyanurate<br>
2	= Irganoxl076(Ciba)<br>
3	= Rhodiastab 55 P (Rhodia)<br>
For cooling, the resulting molten stabilizer composition was then discharged in a thin layer and, after cooling, broken into flakes.<br>
Comparison Example 1:<br>
As comparison test, the following products were added to a melt of 150 g of beef<br>
tallow, 60 g of polyethylene wax and 45 g of oxidised polyethylene wax:<br>
p-diketone (calcium acetylacetonate)	60 g<br>
BSASM1041	60 g<br>
antioxidant2	42 g<br>
hydrotalcite as inorg. acid absorber	150 g<br>
zinc stearate	300 g<br>
organophosphite	30 g<br>
It was then attempted to incorporate a conventional flow aid (Baerorapid 10 F, Baerlocher) into the resulting melt. A rubber-like mass was obtained which was not capable of further processing. The comparison test shows that the combination of lubricants, processing aids and stabilizers in a single composition is possible only because the processing agents are produced by polymerization in the molten lubricant.<br>
This can be explained, for example, by the fact that the processing aids produced by emulsion polymerization known from the prior art have a globular geometry with a hydrophilic surface (emulsifier). Incorporation into a stabilizer mixture, inter alia comprising a lubricant, is thus rendered more difficult. High shear<br><br>
forces are therefore required for their incorporation. This is not the case with the processing aid according to the invention.<br>
