"MULTIPARTICULATE TABLET"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
16 JAN 2007<br><br>
The    present    invention    relates    to.   multiparticulate    tablet,    which disintegrates in the mouth.<br>
Field of the invention.<br>
The present invention is related to new oral pharmaceutical preparations especially for use in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The present prepara.tions comprise a combination of a proton pump inhibitor and an antacid agent in a tablet dosage form that disintegrates in the mouth.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention refers to processes for the preparation of such a tablet and its use in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art.<br>
Various methods and agents have been used to treat and/or eradicate gastrointestinal disorders. These include special diets, refraining from ingestion of certain foods, exercise, meditation, and administration of various pharmaceutical agents such as antacids, H2 antagonists, and antimicrobials. One of the main treatments of today includes the class of pharmaceutical agents, referred to as proton pump inhibitors, that has been developed for treating gastrointestinal disorders. Proton pump inhibitors are agents which<br>
suppress gastric acid secretion by irreversible inhibition of the H /K -ATPase enzyme<br>
system in the parietal cell.<br>
However, given the prevalence and incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, the difficulty in treating many patients suffering from such disorders, and the potential for resistance with antibiotic-containing regimens, a continuing need exists for safe and effective treatments, which are convenient, have good patient compliance and which provide individuals relief from their discomfort.<br>
The administering of a proton pump inhibitor and an antacid rafting agent performed simultaneously but separately has been described in patent application WO 98/23272. The antacid rafting agent is a combination of an antacid agent with one alginate compound. The administering of 40 mg of omeprazole daily for about 28 days and the administering of one tablet of GavisconÂ® four times a day for about 28 days, which delivers a total of 12S0 mg of aluminium hydroxide and 320 milligrams of magnesium<br><br>
The    present    invention    relates    to.   multiparticulate    tablet,    which disintegrates in the mouth.<br>
Field of the invention.<br>
The present invention is related to new oral phannaceutical preparations especially for use in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The present preparations comprise a combination of a proton pump inhibitor and an antacid agent in a tablet dosage form that disintegrates in the mouth.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention refers to processes for the preparation of such a tablet and its use in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art.<br>
Various methods and agents have been used to treat and/or eradicate gastrointestinal disorders. These include special diets, refraining from ingestion of certain foods, exercise, meditation, and administration of various pharmaceutical agents such as antacids, H2 antagonists, and antimicrobials. One of the main treatments of today includes the class of pharmaceutical agents, referred to as proton pump inhibitors, that has been developed for treating gastrointestinal disorders. Proton pump inhibitors are agents which<br>
suppress gastric acid secretion by irreversible inhibition of the H /K -ATPase enzyme<br>
system in the parietal cell.<br>
However, given the prevalence and incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, the difficulty in treating many patients suffering from such disorders, and the potential for resistance with antibiotic-containing regimens, a continuing need exists for safe and effective treatments, which are convenient, have good patient compliance and v/hich provide individuals relief from their discomfort.<br>
The administering of a proton pump inhibitor and an antacid rafting agent performed simultaneously but separately has been described in patent application WO 98/23272. The antacid rafting agent is a combination of an antacid agent with one alginate compound. The administering of 40 mg of omeprazole daily for about 28 days and the administering of one tablet of Gaviscon   four times a day for about 28 days, which delivers a total of 1280 mg of aluminium hydroxide and 320 milligrams of magnesium<br><br>
silicate per day, has been more precisely described. This treatment provides a therapy that shows a bad patient compliance due to the high number of daily doses. Moreover, further compliance problems arrive when proton pump inhibitor and antacid rafting agent are administered for different time periods and consist of different galenic formulations. Administration of two or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results.<br>
WO 97/25066 discloses an oral, multiple unit tableted dosage form comprising an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor and one or more antacid agents or an alginate in a fixed combination formulation, wherein the proton pump inhibitor is in the form of individually enteric coating layered units. The units may also comprise an optional separating layer in between the proton pump inhibitor and the enteric coating. The antacid agent is for instance a mixture of magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate or a mixture of aluminium hydroxide and calcium carbonate.<br>
The enteric coating layer covering the individual units of the said susceptible proton pump inhibitor has properties such that the cornpression of the units into a tablet does not significantly affect the acid resistance of the individually enteric coating layered units.<br>
A tableted multiple unit effervescent dosage form has also been described in WO 97/25030. Enteric coating layered.units containing the active substance is mixed with effervescent tablet'constituents. The compression does not significantly affect the acid resistance of the enteric coating layered pellets, that may further be covered with one or more overcoating layers. Said overcoating enhances compressibility during tableting.<br>
Oral disintegrable multiparticulate tablets have been already described in EP548356, EP1003484, WOOO/27357 and WOOO/51568, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The active ingredient is in the form of coated microcrystals or coated microgranules.<br>
Omeprazole and more generally proton pump inhibitors of the benzamidazole type must be protected with a gastro resistant polymer (enteric coating layer). Enteric films do not show high flexibility so that compression stress can yield rupturing of the film. It is therefore necessary to use a tableting technique that endorses the compression strain and maintains the acid resistance of the formulation after compression of the pellets. Such a formulation technology is described in WO 96/01623 hereby incorporated by reference. In the case of oral disintegradable multiparticulate tablets it has been found that it is also<br><br>
necessary to prevent degradation of the enteric coating film from penetration of saliva into the film. This provokes high stability problems. It has also been found that after disintegration of the tablet in the mouth and swallowing, the antacid agents make pH of the gastric contents rise to a pH value sufficient to provoke solubilisation of the enteric film coating. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present invention provides a barrier layer to cover the enteric coating film.<br>
Outline of the invention<br>
A first object of the invention is to provide a multiparticulate tablet, containing a proton pump inhibitor and an antacid agent, that disintegrates in the mouth and provides a good mouth feeling.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to ensure the stability of the enteric coating film within the oral disintegradable tablet containing the antacid agent together with enteric coated proton pump inhibitor microgranules during storage.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to ensure integrity of the enteric film coating the proton pump inhibitor microgranules during use. The local pH in the antacid part of the tablet is around 9. A barrier coating is applied to protect the enteric coating from dissolution and/or disintegration in the mouth and/or stomach before the microgranules are transported into the small intestine. The tablet according to the present invention must also show satisfactory enteric properties of enteric microgranules, and provide a quick dissolution of the proton pump inhibitor in the small intestine.<br>
The present invention particularly deals with a multiparticulate tablet, which disintegrates in the mouth containing:<br>
i) a proton pump inhibiting ageiit, in particular of the benzimidazole type, in the form of enteric coating layered microgranules and which are overcoated with at least one barrier coating protecting the enteric coating from dissolution and/or disintegrating during the transport of the microgranules into the small intestine; ii) at least one antacid in the form of granules, and;<br>
iii) a mixture of excipients comprising at least one disintegrating agent, one diluent agent and, a lubricant. Optionally, the multiparticulate tablet comprises a swelling agent, a permeabilising agent, sweeteners, flavourings, cooling agents and colours.<br><br><br>
The term "proton pump inhibitor", as used herein refers to any agent within the class of antisecretory compounds, which suppress gastric acid secretion by irreversible inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the parietal cell.<br>
These agents block the final step of acid production with regard to both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Proton pump inhibitors of the benzimidazole type are described in greater detail in Remington : The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Vol. 11, Nineteenth Edition, 892-3 (1995), incorporated herein by reference. Proton pump inhibitors are susceptible to degradation and/or transformation in acid reacting and neutral media and must therefore be protected from contact with acid gastric juice by an enteric coating layer.<br>
Omeprazole; lansoprazole; pantoprazole; rabeprazole; leminoprazole; and mixtures thereof, are proton pump inhibitors, which are preferred for use in the present invention. The proton pump inhibitor may be used in the form of its racemate or a single enatiomer, in the non-salt form or in the form of an alkaline salt of the racemate or one of its single enantioraers. Omeprazole, in particular the magnesium salt thereof or the (S)-isomer of omeprazole in the form of a magnesium salt, are most preferred.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the proton pump inhibiting agent is prepared in the form of enteric coating layered microgranules consisting of a core comprising the said agent optionally in mixture with an alkaline reacting compound. The core is covered by a separating layer and an enteric coating layer, and the enteric coated microgranules being overcoated with the barrier coating, such as for instance a methacrylic copolymer-based film. -<br>
The particle size distribution of the enteric coating layered microgranules is between 100 to 800 Î¼m, preferably between 200 and 500 Î¼m, most preferably around 500 um. Moreover, the barrier coating is preferably a methacrylic copolymer-based film. This barrier film is preferably obtained from a coating liquid of particles of the copolymers of which at least 90% of the particles have a particle size of less than 315 Î¼m. The prepared :oating liquid is either water-based or prepared with organic solvents, preferably a water-ased dispersion due to environmental concerns. This coating liquid should also be able to  sprayed with conventional spray layering equipment.<br><br><br>
The methacrylic copolymer-based barrier coating preferably comprises a butyl methacrylate/ (2-dimethylaminoe.thyl) methacrylate/methyl methacrylate( 1:2:1) copolymer.<br>
Eudragit" E-PO which is a pH-dependant polymer, is preferred for use as barrier coating. A barrier coating comprising EudragitÂ® E-PO can be made mechanically flexible and, when applied in increasing amounts to enteric coating layered proton pump inhibitor microgranules, provide a corresponding increase in the delayed release (dissolution) of the barrier coating. Different times for the delayed dissolution of the barrier coating in a medium of alkaline pH can thus be obtained while maintaining the properties of the enteric coating of the omeprazole microgranules, i.e. good acid resistance and rapid dissolution in the buffer stage testing at pH 6.S of the USP monograph. EudragitÂ® E-PO is a methacrylate copolymer obtained from EudragitÂ® E 100 by milling, yielding a fine powder presentation. The barrier coating can also comprise a combination of methacrylic copolymers, as for example EudragitÂ® L 30 with EudragitÂ® FS 30 D.<br>
Insoluble acrylic polymers, such as for example Eudragit" NE 30 D, Eudragit RL30D, EudragitÂ® RS30D may also be used alone, in combination or in mixture with pH-dependant polymers to form an efficient barrier coating.<br>
The amount of barrier coating is preferably between 5% and 60% of the weight of the enteric coating layered proton pump inhibitor microgranules.<br>
The preferred qualitative formula based on Eudragit   E-PO contains enteric coated pellets equivalent to 20 mg omeprazole/tablet, EudragitÂ® E-PO as barrier coating polymer, dibutylsebacate as plasticiser of the barrier coating, sodium laurylsulfate as an additive for dispersion of E-PO in aqueous solvent and magnesium stearate as a lubricant and a mineral charge of coating film.<br>
The unit amount of such compound is calculated in order to obtain the different relative amount of EudragitÂ®E-PO in the barrier- and enteric-coated omeprazole pellets:<br>
-	10 % as the lowest quantity to provide a rninimum delayed release time of approximately 10 minutes,<br>
-	30 % to provide an intermediate delayed release time of approximately 30 minutes,<br>
- 60 % as maximum value for a 60 minutes delayed release time.<br><br>
Optionally, the barrier coating further comprises an opacifying agent, preferably titanium dioxide.<br>
An optional final polymeric coating, soluble in acidic condition, such as a hypromellose based film, is applied over the methacrylic copolymer-based barrier coating.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the methacrylic copolymer-based barrier coating is obtained from a composition containing the following constituents: Eudragit   E PO (methacrylic copolymer), Dibutyl sebacate, Sodium lauryl sulphate, Magnesium stearate,     ,     '. Titanium dioxide Purified water.<br>
The present invention comprises at least one antacid in the form of granules.<br>
The term "antacid agent", or "antacid(s)" as used herein, refers to any compound, which reacts with hydrochloric acid to form salt and water. Antacid agents are fully described in the following publications which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties: G.B. 925,001, to Fielding et al., published May 1, 1963; and Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Vol. 11, Nineteenth Edition, 886-890 (1995).<br>
Antacid agents useful herein include but are not limited to: aluminium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxy-carbonate, dihydroxy aluminium sodium carbonate, aluminium magnesium glycinate, dihydroxy aluminium amino acetate, dihydroxy aluminiurn aminoacetic acid, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate,, aluminium magnesium hydrated sulfates, magnesium aluminate, magnesium alumino silicates, magnesium carbonate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium trisilicate, sucrafalte, sodium bicarbonate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The classical powder grades of antacid agents show bad tableting properties, and bad organoleptic properties especially regarding mouth feeling and taste. Therefore, the antacid agent is preferably used in the form of granules. Advantageously, the antacid is obtained by dry granulation of CaCO3 and/or Mg(0H)2 and/or A1(0H)3 with mannitol.<br><br><br>
followed by wet granulation using a solution of xylitol and/or sorbitol. Antacid granules may optionally include a disintegrating agent and/or a permeabilisation agent.<br>
Advantageously, the antacid granules according to the invention present particle size distribution between 150 |im and 710 Î¼m, preferably between 355 Î¼m and 710 Î¼m, such that at least 50%, preferably at least 70% of the granules have a particle size ranging between 150 and 710pm and less than 20% of the granules have a particle size less than 150 Î¼m. The particle sizes are measured according to conventional methods, preferably by sieving.<br>
The tablet of the invention also comprises a mixture of excipients. The diluent agent may be selected from water-soluble and/or water-insoluble tabletting filler. The water-soluble diluent agent is constituted from a polyol of less than 13 carbon atoms, in the form of directly compressible materia! (the mean particle size being between 100 and 500 microns), in the form of a powder (the mean particle size being less than 100 microns) or a mixture thereof. The polyol is preferably chosen from the group comprising of mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol and maltitol. The water-insoluble diluent agent is a cellulosic derivative preferably microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
The disintegrating agent is chosen from the group consisting of crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose, crospovidone and their mixtures. A part of the disintegrating agent is advantagenously used for the preparation of antacid granules.<br>
The lubricant agent is chosen from the group consisting of magnesium stearate, sodium stearylfumarate, stearic acid, Macrogol 6000 and their mixtures. A part of the lubricant is used as an internal solid lubricant, another part is advantageously sprayed over the outer surface of the tablet.<br>
The swelling agent is chosen from the group consisting of starch, modified starch or microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
The permeabilising agent is chosen from the group consisting of silica having a high affinity with aqueous solvents, such as SyloidÂ®, maltodextrines, beta-cyclodextrines and their mixtures. The permeabilising agent enables creation of a hydrophilic network that enhances the penetration of the saliva and the disintegration of the tablet. A part of permeabilising agent is advantageously used for the preparation of antacid granules.<br><br>
The sweetener can be chosen in the group consisting of aspartame, potassium acesulfame, sodium saccharinate, dihydrochalcone neohesperidine and their mixtures.<br>
.The flavouring is advantageously chosen to give a combination of fast onset and long-lasting sweet taste and get a "round feeling" in the mouth with, different texturers or additives.<br>
A combination of potassium acesulfame with aspartame is particularly preferred as a sweetener agent.<br>
Cooling agents can also be added in order to improve the mouth feeling and provide a synergy with flavours and sweetness.<br>

The tablet according to the present invention preferably shows an acid binding capacity higher than 10 mEq/tablet and after administration to patients a rapid initial rise in gastric pH. Preferably the acid binding capacity is between 10 and 25 mEq/tablet. The enteric coating of the proton pump inhibitor microgranules complies with the requirements of the USP for enteric coated articles. The release of the proton pump inhibitor in the buffer stage testing (pH 6.8) shows not less than 80% released in 30 minutes. Furthermore, the tablet is preferable round with a diameter of less than 20 mm. Alternatively, the tablet may be oval-shaped.<br>
The tablet according to the invention, has a hardness of not less than 15 N, preferably between 20 to 70 N, when measured with the test method of the European Pharmacopeia (2.9.8).<br>
The present invention also refers to the use of a tablet as described above for the nanufac'ture of a medicament for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
The term "gastrointestinal disorder", as used herein, encompasses any infection, iisease or other disorder(s) of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Such disorders include, for ;xample, heartburn; sour stomach; acid ingestion; upset stomach and/or pain associated<br><br>
with heartburn, sour stomach and acid ingestion; bloating; fullness; dyspepsia; hiatus ' hernia; esophagitis; nocturnal heartburn; erosive esophagitis; disorders not manifested by the presence of ulcerations in the gastric mucosa, including chronic active or atrophic gastritis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; non-ulcer dyspepsia, esophageal reflux disease and gastric motility disorders; peptic ulcer disease, i.e., pre-pyloric, marginal, and/or gastric, duodenal ulcers ; and combinations thereof. Preferred for treatment by the present invention includes heartburn with and without stomach pain, dyspepsia, esophagitis, chronic active or atrophic gastritis and esophageal reflux disease.<br>
The tablet is administered one to several times a day, preferably once or twice daily. The typical daily dose of the active substances varies and will depend on various factors such as the individual requirements of the patients and disease. In general, each tablet will comprise 10-80 mg of the proton pump inhibitor and 200-1500 mg of the antacid agent. Preferably, each tablet will comprise 10-40 mg of the proton pump inhibitor and 300-1000 mg of the antacid agents.<br>
The invention is illustrated more in detail in the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Tests of formulations with and without a barrier coating layer<br>
Stability tests have been performed on the following samples:<br>
- Multiple unit tablets containing enteric coated pellets of omeprazole magnesium<br>
without any barrier coating,<br>
Multiple unit tablets containing enteric coated pellets of omeprazole magnesium protected with a barrier coating of EudragitÂ® E-PO (methacrylic copolymer), -    Multiple unit tablets containing enteric coated pellets of omeprazole magnesium . barrier coated with EudragitÂ® L30 D and FS 30D. These stability tests have been performed in aluminium / aluminium cold formed<br>
blisters in classical I.C.H. conditions (25Â°C / 60 % RH - 30 Â°C / 60 % RH - 40Â°C / 75 %<br>
RH).<br><br>
Results<br>
Enteric coated omeprazole pellets without any barrier coating show an unsatisfactory enteric resistance,.justifying the necessity of a barrier coating. The stability of omeprazole in these preliminary tablets is satisfactory.<br>
Example'2<br>
To promote an acid binding capacity &gt; 10 mEq/tablet and to allow for good physical properties of the tablet (tableting behaviour, organoleptic properties and short disintegrating time), different formulations of the antacid agent have been explored. Granulation of the antacid compounds is preferred. Simple granulation, or granulation followed by a light coating phase can be performed in order to obtain a better taste and physical behaviour of the granules.<br>
Furthermore, introduction of a filler allows for good taste and physical behaviour in the dry mix of antacids. Wetting and granulating with different aqueous binder solutions may further strengthen these characteristics. The best results were obtained by combining 12 % mannitol in dry mix followed by granulation with xylitol or sorbitol solution.<br>
The most preferred antacid formulation or a multiple thereof is the following:<br><br>
