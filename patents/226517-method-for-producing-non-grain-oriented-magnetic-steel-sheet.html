				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCING NON-GRAIN-ORIENTED MAGNETIC STEEL<br>
SHEET<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing non-<br>
grain-oriented magnetic steel sheet. In this document,<br>
"non-grain-oriented magnetic steel sheet" refers to<br>
magnetic steel sheet as defined in DIN EN 10106<br>
("finally-annealed magnetic steel sheet") and DIN EN<br>
10165 ("magnetic sheet which has not been finally-<br>
annealed"). Furthermore, this also includes more strongly<br>
anisotropic types, provided they are not deemed to be<br>
grain-oriented magnetic steel sheet.<br>
Non-grain-oriented magnetic steel sheets with a thickness<br>
ranging from 0.65 to 1 mm are for example used in the<br>
production of motors which are only switched on for a<br>
short time of operation. Typically, such motors are used<br>
in the field of domestic appliances or equipment, or as<br>
auxiliary drives in motor vehicles. Such motors are<br>
intended to produce high performance, while energy<br>
consumption only plays a subordinate role.<br>
A first method for producing non-grain-oriented hot-<br>
rolled magnetic steel sheet is known from DE 198 07<br>
122.Al In the known method, a raw material comprising (in<br>
mass per cent) 0.001 to 0.1 % C, 0.05 to 3.0 % Si, up to<br>
0.85 % Al, wherein % Si +2A1 
with the remainder being iron and the usual impurities,<br>
is hot rolled, either directly from the casting heat or<br>
after reheating, to a temperature of at least 900 °C.<br>
During hot-rolling, two or more forming passes are<br>
carried out in a targeted way in the two-phase region<br>
austenite/ferrite. In this way, if necessary a cold-<br>
rolled and finally-treated magnetic steel sheet can be<br>
produced in a manner which saves time and energy, said<br><br>
magnetic steel sheet having improved magnetic<br>
characteristics when compared to conventional sheet of<br>
this type.<br>
In the conventional production of non-grain-oriented<br>
magnetic steel sheet, as is for example described in EP 0<br>
897 993 Al, usually a slab or thin slab cast from a steel<br>
of a particular composition, is rough rolled to form a<br>
roughed strip. This roughed strip is subsequently hot-<br>
rolled in several passes. If required,, the hot-rolled<br>
strip is annealed and subsequently coiled. After coiling,<br>
as a rule, pickling and further annealing of the hot<br>
strip take place, said hot strip being finally cold-<br>
rolled to final thickness in one step, or in several<br>
steps with intermediate annealing. If required,<br>
supplementary skin-pass rolling is carried out. If<br>
required by the end user, the cold-rolled strip is also<br>
subjected to final annealing.<br>
Instead of rough rolling a roughed strip from a cast<br>
slab, it is also possible to use thin slabs or to use<br>
cast roughed strip directly to produce magnetic sheets.<br>
When using cast roughed strip, there is also the option<br>
of casting extremely thin strip with dimensions which<br>
approximate the dimensions of the hot strip to be<br>
produced. Technological advantages and cost advantages<br>
can be achieved by integrating casting of such a roughed<br>
strip and hot-rolling of such a strip in a continuous<br>
process.<br>
Each of the individual processing steps during the<br>
production has an influence on the magnetic<br>
characteristics of the end product. For this reason for<br>
example, the pass sequence and the state of the<br>
microstructure in the hot strip during each roll pass are<br><br>
set during hot-rolling, depending on the transformation<br>
behaviour of the steel which is governed by the<br>
composition of the steel by way of the temperature at the<br>
beginning of rolling and the cooling carried out between<br>
the individual roll passes, such that the desired<br>
magnetic characteristics of the end product are achieved.<br>
Likewise, the characteristics of the end product are<br>
determined by the annealing temperatures, the coiling<br>
temperature and the deformation during cold rolling.<br>
Due to the large number of production steps, the<br>
production of magnetic steel sheet is technically<br>
demanding and expensive. This is a disadvantage in<br>
particular in the case of sheet of increased thickness.<br>
It is thus the object of the invention to provide a<br>
method which makes it possible in particular to<br>
economically produce thicker magnetic steel sheet which<br>
is not grain-oriented and which has good magnetic<br>
properties.<br>
This object is met by a method for producing non-grain-<br>
oriented hot-rolled magnetic steel sheet in which from a<br>
raw material such as cast slabs, strip, roughed strip or<br>
thin slabs, said raw material comprising a steel with (in<br>
weight per cent)<br>
C: 0.0001 - 0.05 %;<br>
SI: ≤ 1.5 %;<br>
Al: ≤ 0.5 %; wherein [%Si] + 2[%A1] ≤ 1.8;<br>
Mn: 0.1 - 1.2 %;<br>
with the remainder being iron as well as the usual<br>
impurities;<br><br>
is produced; in a finishing roll line at temperatures<br>
which are above the Ar1-temperature, a hot strip of a<br>
thickness ≤ 1.5 mm is rolled, wherein at least the last<br>
forming pass of hot rolling is carried out in the mixed<br>
region austenite / ferrite, and wherein the total<br>
deformation sH achieved during rolling in the mixed region<br>
austenite / ferrite is 
according to the invention can comprise up to a total of<br>
1.5 % of alloying additions, such as P, Sn, Sb, Zr, V,<br>
Ti, N, Ni, Co, Nb and / or B.<br>
According to the invention, a strip, cast from austenite-<br>
forming steel and used directly from the casting heat, is<br>
rolled to form a hot strip. The rolling conditions during<br>
hot-rolling are such that complete ferrite transformation<br>
has not been finished at the time when rolling is<br>
complete. Instead, at least the last pass takes place in<br>
the mixed region austenite / ferrite, while all other<br>
passes are rolled in the austenite.<br>
By carrying out production of the raw material and hot<br>
rolling of the magnetic steel sheet in a process<br>
according to the invention, non-grain-oriented magnetic<br>
steel strip can be produced which is thin enough for<br>
shipment to the end user without the need for renewed<br>
cold-rolling for thickness reduction. Particularly good<br>
results can be achieved with the method according to the<br>
invention if the raw material is produced as a cast thin<br>
slab or cast, strip, and if hot rolling is carried out as<br>
a continuous process following the production of the raw<br>
material. Thus, hot strips which have been produced<br>
according to the invention from a raw material produced<br>
on a cast-rolling plant and subjected to continuous<br>
further processing, have excellent characteristics.<br><br>
It has been shown that when observing the operating<br>
conditions as provided according to the invention, hot-<br>
rolled non-grain-oriented magnetic steel sheet can be<br>
produced whose characteristics are at least equivalent to<br>
magnetic steel sheet which has been cold-rolled in the<br>
conventional way, following hot-strip production. The<br>
method according to the invention further makes it<br>
possible to economically produce high-grade magnetic<br>
steel sheet with good magnetic characteristics, while<br>
saving costly and time-consuming process steps, which in<br>
the state of the art have always been assumed to be<br>
necessary.<br>
Normally, after completion of hot-rolling, the hot strip,<br>
which has been cooled if necessary, is coiled. The<br>
coiling temperature is preferably at least 700 °C.<br>
Experience has shown that if this coiling temperature is<br>
maintained, hot-strip annealing can be done without<br>
entirely or at least to a significant degree. This is<br>
because the hot strip is already being softened in the<br>
coil, wherein the parameters which determine the<br>
characteristics of said hot strip, parameters such as<br>
grain size, texture and precipitation, are positively<br>
influenced. In this context it is particularly<br>
advantageous if the strip is subjected to passive<br>
annealing, using the coil heat. Such annealing, carried<br>
out in-line from the coil heat, of the hot strip which<br>
has been coiled at high temperature and which has not<br>
undergone significant cooling in the coil, may completely<br>
replace hot-strip hood-type annealing which might<br>
otherwise have been necessary. In this way, annealed hot<br>
strip with particularly good magnetic and technological<br>
characteristics can be produced. The required effort in<br>
time and energy is considerably reduced when compared to<br>
the time and energy required during conventional hot-<br><br>
strip annealing which is carried out to improve the<br>
properties of magnetic steel sheet.<br>
As an alternative or as a supplement to "passive"<br>
annealing in the coil, the strip can be subjected to<br>
annealing following coiling, provided the properties to<br>
be achieved require this. Irrespective of the form in<br>
which hot-strip annealing is carried out, it may be<br>
advantageous if annealing is carried out in the<br>
conventional way in an oxygen-reduced atmosphere.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, which<br>
is particularly suitable for processing a steel with an<br>
Si content of at least 0.7 % by weight, after rolling in<br>
the finishing roll line, the hot strip is coiled at a<br>
coiling temperature of less than 600 °C, in particular<br>
less than 550 °C. In the alloys concerned, coiling at<br>
these temperatures leads to a strengthened hot-strip<br>
state. Further improvements in the characteristics of<br>
magnetic steel sheet coiled and alloyed in this way can<br>
be achieved in that the coiled hot strip is cooled at an<br>
accelerated rate, in the coil, immediately following<br>
coiling.<br>
Practical tests have shown that magnetic steel sheet hot<br>
strip with particularly good characteristics can be<br>
produced if most of the deformation duiring hot rolling<br>
clearly takes place in the austenite region. Thus, a<br>
further embodiment of the invention, which embodiment<br>
takes account of this result, is characterised in that<br>
deformation εH achieved during rollings in the mixed region<br>
austenite / ferrite, is limited to 10 % - 15 %.<br>
Irrespective of the degree of deformation of the hot<br>
strip in the mixed region γ/α, optimal temperature<br><br>
management in terms of a prevention of cooling of the<br>
roll stock can be achieved by a suitable selection of the<br>
ratio of the degree of forming to the speed of forming,<br>
i.e. by using the heat produced during deformation, and<br>
thus complete transformation to ferrite can be prevented.<br>
In this context, the term "total deformation εH" refers to<br>
the ratio of the thickness reduction during rolling in<br>
the respective phase region to the thickness of the strip<br>
when it enters the respective phase region. According to<br>
this definition, the thickness of a hot strip which has<br>
been produced according to the invention, for example<br>
after rolling in the austenitic region, is h0. During<br>
subsequent rolling in the two-phase mixed region, the<br>
thickness of the hot strip is reduced to h1. According to<br>
the definition, during mixed rolling, this results in a<br>
total deformation εH to (h0 - h1) / h0, where h0 = thickness<br>
at the time of entry into the first roll stand passed in<br>
the mixed state austenite / ferrite, and h1 = thickness<br>
when leaving the last roll stand passed in the mixed<br>
state.<br>
In order to improve the quality of the strip surface and<br>
further processability, it is advantageous if the hot<br>
strip is pickled after coiling.<br>
If the end user demands a finally annealed magnetic steel<br>
sheet, it is advantageous to anneal the hot strip after<br>
pickling at an annealing temperature of at least 740 °C<br>
to obtain a finally-annealed magnetic steel strip. If by<br>
contrast, final annealing after pickling is carried out<br>
at a lower annealing temperature of at least 650 °C, then<br>
a magnetic steel strip is obtained which has not been<br>
finally annealed, which if required, can be subjected to<br>
final annealing at the end-user's premises. Depending on<br><br>
the characteristics of the respective alloy, the desired<br>
characteristics of the magnetic steel sheet and the plant<br>
and equipment available, either of the annealing<br>
treatments can be carried out either in a hood-type<br>
furnace or in a continuous furnace.<br>
A further improvement in the processability of the hot<br>
magnetic steel strip produced and shipped according to<br>
the invention, can be achieved in that the pickled hot<br>
strip is smooth-rolled at a degree of forming of up to<br>
3 %. During such rolling, uneven areas in the surface of<br>
the strip are smoothed out without there being any<br>
considerable effect on the microstructure generated as<br>
part of hot rolling.<br>
As an alternative or as a supplement to a pure smoothing<br>
pass of the type mentioned above, dimensional accuracy<br>
and surface quality of the hot-rolled strip produced<br>
according to the invention can further be improved in<br>
that the pickled hot strip is skin pass rolled at a<br>
degree of forming exceeding 3 % to 15 %. Again, this re-<br>
rolling does not lead to any microstructural changes<br>
which would be comparable to the changes which are<br>
usually brought about in a targeted way during cold<br>
rolling, because of the high degree of forming achieved<br>
during cold rolling.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the invention is<br>
characterised in that hot rolling in the mixed region is<br>
accompanied by lubrication. Hot-rolling with lubrication<br>
results in less shearing deformation, so that the rolled<br>
strip has a more homogenous structure along its cross<br>
section. Furthermore, lubrication results in reduced<br>
rolling forces so that increased thickness reduction is<br>
possible in the respective roll pass.<br><br>
Preferably, the final thickness of the hot strip is<br>
0.65 mm to 1 mm. There is considerable demand, in the<br>
market, for economically produced and thus economically<br>
priced strip of this thickness.<br>
The method according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for processing steels with an Si content of max.<br>
1 weight %. Such steels have a pronounced austenite phase<br>
so that the transition from the austenite to the mixed<br>
phase austenite / ferrite can be controlled particularly<br>
accurately.<br>
If the carbon content of the steel exceeds 0.005 weight<br>
%, it is advantageous if the hot strip is annealed in a<br>
decarburising medium prior to finishing and shipment.<br>
Below, the invention is explained in more detail with<br>
reference to/exemplary embodiments:<br>
Hereinafter, "J2500", "J5000" and "J10000" respectively,<br>
designate the magnetic polarisation at magnetic field<br>
strengths of 2 50 0 A/m, 5000 A/m and 1000 0 A/m<br>
respectively.<br>
"P 1.0" and "P 1.5" refer to the hysteresis loss at a<br>
polarisation of 1.0 T and 1.5 T respectively, and a<br>
frequency of 50 Hz.<br>
The magnetic properties stated in the following tables<br>
have been measured on individual strips along the<br>
direction of rolling.<br>
Table 1 shows the content, in weight %, of the alloying<br>
constituents essential to the properties, of steels used<br><br>
for the production of magnetic steel sheet according to<br>
the invention.<br><br>
Melts formed according to the compositions shown in Table<br>
1 were continuously cast in a cast-rolling plant to<br>
produce a roughed strip which again was continuously fed<br>
to a separate hot-roll line comprising several roll<br>
stands.<br>
Tables 2a - 2c show the magnetic properties J2500/ J5000/<br>
J10000, P1.0 and P1-5 for three magnetic steel sheets Al - A3<br>
and Bl - B3, made from the steels A and B respectively.<br>
During hot-rolling of these magnetic steel sheets Al - A3<br>
and B 1 - B3, the emphasis of deformation was placed in<br>
the region in which the respective strip was in the<br>
austenitic state. By contrast, only one roll pass was<br>
carried out in the mixed region austenite / ferrite. The<br>
total deformation εH achieved during this process was less<br>
than 35 %, in particular 30 %.<br>
Subsequent to rolling, the hot strip were coiled at a<br>
coiling temperature of 750 °C„<br><br><br><br>
In the case of examples Al, Bl (Table 2a), after cooling,<br>
the hot strips were finished directly to form the usual<br>
commercial magnetic steel sheets and subsequently before<br>
being shipped to the end user. In the case of examples<br>
A2, B2 (Table 2b), the hot strips were pickled and<br>
additionally subjected to a smoothing pass prior to<br>
shipment to the end user. During this smoothing pass, a<br>
deformation εH of max. 3 % was achieved. Prior to<br>
shipment, the strips A3, B3 (Table 2c) were pickled and<br>
then skin pass rolled.<br>
Comparison tests carried out on magnetic steel sheet 1 mm<br>
in thickness, produced according to the method according<br>
to the invention, said sheet having been hot rolled and<br>
cold rolled in the conventional way, show that the<br>
achievable values of magnetic polarisation and the<br>
achievable values of the specific hysteresis loss of<br>
magnetic steel sheet produced according to the invention,<br>
agree within close ranges, with the values which were<br>
determined for the respective characteristics, in<br>
conventionally produced magnetic steel sheet.<br>
Diagram 1 shows the logarithmic curve of the magnetic<br>
polarisation of three magnetic steel sheets a, b, c,<br>
produced according to the invention, and of one sheet d,<br>
produced in a conventional way, in relation to the<br>
magnetic field strength. Sheet a was used directly, sheet<br><br>
b was subjected to a smoothing pass, and sheet c was<br>
subjected to skin pass rolling.<br>
Diagram 2 shows the logarithmic curve of the specific<br>
hysteresis loss of three magnetic steel sheets a, b, c,<br>
produced according to the invention, and of one sheet d,<br>
produced in a conventional way, in relation to the<br>
magnetic polarisation.<br>
The diagrams clearly show that the characteristics of the<br>
sheets a, b, c, produced according to the invention, only<br>
slightly differ from the characteristics of<br>
conventionally produced magnetic steel sheet. This shows<br>
that with optimisation of the rolling strategy applied<br>
during hot rolling, undertaken according to the<br>
invention, and with the removal of costly cold rolling,<br>
high-quality marketable magnetic steel sheet can be<br>
produced.<br><br>
