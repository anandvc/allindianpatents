The invention relates to a method and a device to enable and to perform a check of a permission status of a mobile equipment.<br>
Description of prior art<br>
According to the state of the art mobile networks such as GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks, GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) networks or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) networks comprise a database for storing identifications of mobile equipment according to a permission status of the mobile equipment. An example of an identification of mobile equipment according to the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) is the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) as described in the TS (technical specification) 22.106 of the 3GPP. A database for storing identifications of mobile equipment according to a permission status is the EIR (Equipment Identity Register) as specified for GSM, GPRS and UMTS networks.<br>
A known method for classifying the permission status of a mobile equipment is the assignment of the identification of a mobile equipment to a white list or to a black list. Mobile equipment assigned to the white list is deemed to be permitted for use. Mobile equipment assigned to the black list is deemed not permitted for use and should be barred. An additional register that may be used by an operator of a mobile network is a gray list comprising equipment that is deemed permitted for use but should be monitored.<br>
According to the state of the art a check of the permission status of a mobile equipment may be performed by the core network node where the subscriber, who is using the mobile equipment is currently registered, i.e. the MSC (Mobile Services Switching Centre) respectively the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) currently serving the subscriber who is using the mobile equipment. A network architecture to perform that check of the permission status is specified in the TS 23.002 of the 3GPP. A check of the permission status may be performed via a so-called F-interface between the MSC and the EIR respectively via a so-called Gf- interface between the<br>
2<br><br>
SGSN and the EIR. To perform the permission status check signaling messages compliant to the MAP (mobile application part) protocol may be used.<br>
If a mobile equipment is assigned to the black list, i.e. the mobile equipment is 'blacklisted' or if the mobile equipment is not assigned to the white list i.e. the mobile equipment is 'unknown', the outcome of a check of the permission status of a mobile equipment may be a termination of the transaction performed using the mobile equipment. I.e. the network may terminate an access attempt or ongoing call.<br>
According to the state of the art the permission status of a mobile equipment may be checked at any access attempt of the mobile equipment. In addition to that a permission status of a mobile equipment may be checked at regular intervals or at particular events such as a location update of the mobile equipment.<br>
To avoid misuse of mobile equipment as much as possible a large number of checks of the permission status has to be performed, thus creating a high processing load in the core network node administrating the subscribers utilizing the mobile equipment and a high signaling load on the interface between the core network node and the equipment database.<br>
Therefore it is object of the invention to provide a method for checking the security status of a mobile equipment that reduces the processing and signaling load for the status checking.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This object is achieved by the method of claim 1, the method of claim 4, the mobile equipment database of claim 5 and the core network node of claim 8. Advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the present invention a method is provided for enabling a check of a permission status associated with a registered mobile equipment. The invented method comprises the following steps:<br>
-	receiving an indication of a current change of a permission status associated with the<br>
registered mobile equipment,<br>
-	determining an address of a core network node currently administrating the<br>
3<br><br>
subscriber utilizing the registered mobile equipment, and<br>
-	sending a trigger message indicating the change of the permission status of the<br>
registered mobile equipment towards the core network node and triggering a check of<br>
the permission status associated with the registered mobile equipment, the trigger<br>
message comprising an identification of the registered mobile equipment.<br>
The trigger message may also comprise the currently changed permission status associated with the mobile equipment.<br>
The method is advantageous in that it allows reducing the required number of checks of the security status significantly, i.e. in principle a security check only need to be performed when the security status associated with the mobile equipment has changed. This provides a significant reduction on processing power and signalling related to permission status checks.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the method determining the address of the core network node comprises the steps of:<br>
-	receiving a message from the core network node, said message comprising an<br>
address of the core network node and an identification of the registered mobile<br>

registered mobile equipment.<br>
This method to determine the address of the core network node is advantageous in that it may utilize existing interfaces between a core network node and a mobile equipment database that implements the invention.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invented method determining the address of the core network node comprises the steps of:<br>
retrieving an identification of a subscriber currently utilizing the registered mobile equipment from a database storing identifications of subscribers in relation to respective identifications of mobile equipment utilized by the subscribers, and<br>
-	retrieving the core network node currently administrating the subscriber utilizing the<br>
4<br><br>
registered mobile equipment from a database storing an identification of a visited core network node in relation to an identification of a visiting subscriber.<br>
By this existing databases may be used and modifications in the implementation of a mobile equipment database can be minimized.<br>
The invention is further embodied in a method for performing a check of a permission status associated with a mobile equipment. This method comprises the steps of:<br>

-	receiving an indication of a transaction performed using the mobile equipment, the<br>
indication of the transaction comprising the identification of the mobile equipment,<br>
and<br>
-	according to the determined permission status terminating the performed transaction<br>
or not.<br>
The permission status may be transmitted with the trigger message, and stored in the core network node in a way that it is retrievable using the identification of the mobile equipment or, alternatively, the permission status may be retrieved from a mobile equipment data base upon the indication that a transaction is performed using the mobile equipment and therefore the permission status of the mobile equipment needs to be checked.<br>
The invention is further embodied in a mobile equipment database for registering mobile equipment according to a permission status. The database enables a check of a permission status associated with a registered mobile equipment and the database comprises:<br>

Detailed description of embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a method to enable and to perform a check of a security status of a mobile equipment ME in telecommunication network. For reasons of simplicity only entities of the telecommunication network that are involved in the check of the security status are shown. The telecommunication network may be a e.g. a GSM network, a GPRS network or a UMTS network. The telecommunication network comprises a core network Nl node administrating the subscriber that is currently using the mobile equipment ME or in other words the core network node that is currently serving the subscriber utilizing the mobile equipment ME. In case of a GSM network the core network node Nl may be a MSC (Mobile Services Switching Center) and in case of a GPRS or UMTS network the core network node Nl may be an SGSN (Serving GPRS support Node).<br>
The telecommunication network further comprises an equipment database N2 storing identifications of mobile equipment associated to a permission status for the mobile equipment. The equipment database may be e.g. an EIR (Equipment Identity Register) and the permission status may be e.g. 'white listed' indicating that the respective mobile equipment is deemed to be permitted for use, 'black listed' indicating that the respective mobile equipment is deemed not permitted for use and should be barred, or 'gray listed' indicating that the respective equipment is deemed permitted for use but should be monitored. To indicate the different permission statuses, the equipment database N2 may comprise a different register for each permission status. The mobile equipment ME is registered with the equipment database N2.<br>
To provide addressing the core network node Nl administrating the subscriber currently using the mobile equipment ME, the equipment database N2 may perform some initiating steps. Upon reception of a message SI from the core network node<br>
8<br><br>
Nl, said message comprising an address of the core network node CN and an identification of the mobile equipment ME, the equipment database may in a step S2 store the address of the core network node Nl in a way that it is retrievable using the identification of the mobile equipment ME. The message SI maybe a new MAP (mobile application part) message that comprises an address of the core network node Nl, e.g. an ISDN (integrated services digital network) number assigned to the core network node Nl.<br>
In an indicating step S3 a current change of a permission status associated with the registered mobile equipment is indicated to the equipment database N2, e.g. the operator may have been indicated that the mobile equipment ME has been stolen and should be 'black-listed' accordingly.<br>
The change of the permission status of the mobile equipment ME is indicated towards the core network node CN in a trigger message S4 together with an identification of the mobile equipment ME to trigger a check of the permission status associated with the registered mobile equipment ME. The trigger S4 message may be a new MAP message.<br>
In addition to indicating the change of the transmission status, the trigger message S4 may also comprise the new permission status. In this case, the currently changed permission status maybe stored in the core network node CN in a step S5 to be retrievable using the identification of the mobile equipment ME that has been sent with the message S4.<br>
To provide addressing the core network node CN the previously stored address of the core network node CN may be retrieved using the identification of the mobile equipment ME.<br>
Alternatively to the above-described method for determining the address of the core network node administrating the subscriber who is using the mobile equipment, the address of the core network node (Nl) may be retrieved from the identification of the mobile equipment by subsequent database queries. Using a first database query comprising the identification of the mobile equipment an identification of the subscriber currently utilizing the registered mobile equipment may be retrieved from a<br>
9<br><br>
database storing identifications of subscribers in relation to respective identifications of mobile equipment utilized by the subscribers. Such a database maybe a stand-alone database or maybe comprised a subscriber database serving further purposes such an HLR (Home Location Register) or an HSS (Home Subscriber Server). Using a second database query comprising the obtained identification of the subscriber, the identification of the core network node Nl currently administrating the subscriber utilizing the mobile equipment ME may be retrieved the from a database storing an identification of a visited core network node in relation to an identification of a visiting subscriber. Such a database maybe e.g. an HLR (Home Location Register) or an HSS (Home Subscriber Server).<br>
When the subscriber utilizing the mobile equipment performs a next transaction, the core network node Nl may receive an indication of the transaction in a message S6 from the subscriber, the message comprising the identification of the mobile equipment ME. The transaction may be e.g. a location update or an attach of the subscriber utilizing the mobile equipment.<br>
According to the indication of the transaction the core network nodes performs a check of the permission status of the mobile equipment. If the current permission status of the mobile equipment has not been transmitted previously, the core network node may retrieve the current permission status of the mobile equipment ME from the equipment data base N2 using the identification of the mobile equipment ME.<br>
Alternatively, if the current permission status has been previously transmitted and stored in the core network node Nl, the core network node Nl may use the identification of the mobile equipment and retrieve the previously stored permission status associated with the mobile equipment ME.<br>
According to the determined permission status the core network node Nl may a step S7 terminate the transaction of the mobile equipment or not. I.e. if the permission status of the mobile equipment is 'white-listed' the transaction may not be terminated and may continue. If the determined permission status is 'black-listed' the transaction may in be terminated and the subscriber may be notified accordingly.<br>
