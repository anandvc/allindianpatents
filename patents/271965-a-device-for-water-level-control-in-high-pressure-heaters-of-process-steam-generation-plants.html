FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a device for continuous control and display of the level<br>
of water in a process steam generation plant where pressurized water and steam<br>
co-exists at high temperature.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Presently the level of water in a process steam generation plant is measured<br>
using differential pressure, time taken for sound or electromagnetic wave to<br>
reflect from the junction of steam and water.<br>
One of the methods to measure the water level is to measure the height of water<br>
column using differential pressure sensors. However, the differential pressure<br>
created by the change in the height of water level is very small. When this<br>
happens in a highly pressurized vessel, the ability of the pressure transducer to<br>
resolve this differential pressure is significantly reduced.<br>
Another method for measuring the level of water is by the time taken by a sound<br>
wave to travel from the source to the junction of steam and water. The sound<br>
can travel in steam or metal wire. In this device there are difficulties of isolating<br>
the sensors from the heat. If the medium is steam then the velocity of sound<br>
significantly changes due to temperature and pressure. Thus there are always<br>
significant errors as most of the available instruments cannot compensate for the<br>
 <br>
3<br>
temperature and pressure changes. Where, a wire is used for transmission of<br>
sound, a magnetic float is used to identify the steam and water junction. In this<br>
type of devices, the magnet loses its magnetism when operating at high<br>
temperature.<br>
The radar type devices for measuring the level of water uses the time taken for<br>
the electromagnetic waves to reflect from the surface of the water and steam<br>
junction. This again has the difficulty of isolating the transmitter from heat.<br>
Moreover, for most of the prior art devices, the response time is 0.7 to 1 second,<br>
which is substantially slow for the control of water level in the thermal power<br>
plant, in particular in a process steam generation plant.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a device for water level<br>
control in high pressure heaters in process steam generation plants, in particular<br>
thermal power plant.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a device for water level control in<br>
high pressure heaters in process steam generation plants, in particular thermal<br>
power plant, which is capable of operating at subcritical temperatures and<br>
pressures of water.<br>
 <br>
4<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a device for water level control in<br>
high pressure heaters in process steam generation plants, in particular thermal<br>
power plant, which does not have any moving component enabling to sustain<br>
longer operational life.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a device for water level control<br>
in high pressure heaters in process steam generation plants, in particular thermal<br>
power plant, which is simple and cost-effective.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, the device is designed to measure the level of water<br>
and steam in a high temperature and pressure environment prevailing in a<br>
thermal power plant. This level of water and steam is then compared with the<br>
set values and an electrical output signal is generated for the control of the<br>
valves necessary to maintain the water level in a pressurised vessel. A visual<br>
display is provided in respect of the level of water and steam at the place of<br>
operation. A scheme connectivity of various plant control systems with different<br>
technologies, is proposed. Using the connectivity scheme the display may be<br>
provided to the plant control systems located remotely.<br>
The invention thus enables water level control in the high pressure heaters of a<br>
thermal power plant. The device is designed to operate at sub critical<br>
temperatures and pressures of water. The water has very high dielectric constant<br>
when compared to steam. But as the density of water and steam changes, the<br>
 <br>
5<br>
dielectric constant changes. The ratio of dielectric constant of water and steam<br>
approaches unity as the steam reaches critical point.<br>
The device uses no moving part and all parts have the capability to sustain the<br>
temperature and pressure encountered in a steam power plant continuously.<br>
The sensed level is compared with the three set points and a preferred<br>
proportionate signal is generated for the feed water bypass system. The device is<br>
capable of being set from a computer and also generates signal for the different<br>
types of communication and hard ware for the plant control system.<br>
The device displays the level of the water locally using Vh digit 7 segment LED<br>
display. For communication to other systems and computers, the communication<br>
is achieved by Ethernet, RS232, RS 485, Modbus protocols. This communication<br>
is used for setting and calibration of the device and for the remote display.<br>
The rate of change of water level is analysed and correspondingly the output<br>
signal is generated for the control valves, to maintain the water level at set<br>
points. Three set points are used for the control of there separate control valves.<br>
Three outputs are available as 4 - 20mA signals. These outputs are also<br>
available on the digital communication channels. A high level signal is generated<br>
for the feed water bypass system.<br>
The device can be calibrated and set to different water levels for operation, by<br>
the use of the computer.<br>
 <br>
6<br>
The device is capable of sensing the change of level in 0.015 seconds and<br>
generate new results for the output control signals in less than 0.075 seconds.<br>
This speed is required as many of the processes in a thermal power plant are<br>
very fast.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 - shows a schematic of the device according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 - shows the schematic for the electronics incorporated in the device of the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In configuration of the device, the invention adapts the known scientific principle<br>
for example, when two electrodes are separated by dielectric medium, a<br>
capacitor is formed. If the dielectric medium is liquid and its level between the<br>
plates vary, the capacitance also varies proportionately. On calibration of the<br>
capacitance to the level of the fluid, the device becomes a level measurement<br>
device.<br>
As shown in figure - 1, the device is built around a sintered Alumina tube (2).<br>
This tube (2) is placed inside a stainless steel tube (3). The stainless steel tube<br>
(3) is sealed with the Alumina tube (2) using special type of copper ferrule (8).<br>
This makes a closed chamber with the inside wall having a ceramic<br>
 <br>
7<br>
insulator and on the outside, a steel tube. Due the thermal cycling there are<br>
possibilities that the ferrule (8) will start leaking. This possibility has been taken<br>
care by providing a plurality of springs (9) which constantly apply a heavy force<br>
on the ferrule (8), keeping it tight over the Alumina tube (2).<br>
There is a difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion of the alumina tube<br>
(2) and the stainless steel tube (3). This has been compensated by using at least<br>
one bellows (6), so that a very little axial force is transmitted on the ferrule (8)<br>
due to differential thermal expansion.<br>
Inside the Alumina tube (2), another ceramic tube is placed, over which SS foil is<br>
wrapped. This serves as a second electrode (4), the first being the stainless steel<br>
tube (3), ground to the earth of the electronics. As the pressure and temperature<br>
vary during the operation, the dielectric properties of water and steam<br>
consequently vary. Hence, for the measurement of capacitance, two reference<br>
electrodes (1,7) of ten mm length are created. The ratio of capacitance of these<br>
reference electrode (1,7) are connected by wires to the electronic circuits placed<br>
in a separate box.<br>
The steam and water inlet are connected to the stainless steel tube (3) by a half<br>
circle tube (5). This half circle tube (5) absorbs all the stresses caused by<br>
differential thermal expansion of the casing, fittings and the main Stainless steel<br>
tube (3).<br>
 <br>
8<br>
As shown in figure - 2, the capacitance is measured by the time taken for<br>
charging and discharging the capacitor between two fixed voltages. Similarly the<br>
time is measured for charging and discharging of the capacitance formed by the<br>
reference electrodes (1,7). These three timings are analysed in a microcontroller<br>
to generate signals for controlling the three control valves (not shown).<br>
Depending upon the rate of rise or fall of water level, the corresponding digital<br>
signal is derived for modulating the control valve. The digital signal is further<br>
converted to 4 - 20mA signal for controlling the valves. A microcontroller<br>
generates output for local LED display of the level. To make the device<br>
compatible with the different standards of plant control system, outputs for RS<br>
232, RS 484, Ethernet and modbus communication protocols are generated.<br>
These signals make the remote display possible. The device is capable of being<br>
calibrated and set with laptop or computer.<br>
If the reference electrode meant for steam (7) is covered with the water then<br>
the ratio of dielectric constant is one and value of capacitance of individual<br>
electrodes (1,7) is high. Similarly if the reference electrode for the water (1), is<br>
in steam then also the ratio of dielectric constant is one and value of capacitance<br>
of individual electrodes is low. By these values the microcontroller can determine<br>
the high and low level of the water level, ie when the water and steam are<br>
beyond the range of the device.<br>
