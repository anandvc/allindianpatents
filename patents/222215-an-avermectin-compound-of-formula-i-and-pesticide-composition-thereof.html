Hereinbefore and hereinafter, the bond marked by the symbol /*~- in formulae (I), (II) and (IV) indicates that at the e-position the S- as well as the R-isomer is meant.<br>
Certain macrolide compounds are proposed for pest control in the literature. The biological properties of those known compounds are not entirely satisfactory, however, for which reason there is a need to provide further compounds having pesticidal properties, especially for the control of insects and members of the order Acarina. That problem is solved according to the invention by the provision of the present compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds claimed according to the invention are derivatives of avermectin. Avermectins are known to the person skilled in the art. They are a group of structurally closely related pesticidally active compounds which are obtained by fermentation of a strain of the microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis. Derivatives of avermectins can be obtained via conventional chemical syntheses.<br>
The avermectins obtainable from Streptomyces avermitilis are designated A1a, A1b, A2a, A2b, B1 a, B1b, B2a and B2b. Compounds with the designation "A" have a methoxy radical in the 5-position; those compounds designated "B" have an OH group. The "a" series comprises compounds wherein the substituent R! (in position 25) is a sec-butyl radical; in the "b" series there is an isopropyl radical in the 25-position. The number 1 in the name of a compound indicates that atoms 22 and 23 are bonded by a double bond; the number 2 indicates that they are bonded by a single bond and carbon atom 23 carries an OH group. The above designations are retained in the description of the present invention in order in the case of the non-natural avermectin derivatives according to the invention to indicate the specific structural type corresponding to natural avermectin. There are claimed according to the invention derivatives of compounds of the B1 and B2 series, more especially mixtures of derivatives of avermectin B1 a, B1 b, B2a and B2b or the corresponding monosaccharides having, at the 4'- or 4"-position (e-position), either the S- or the R-configuration.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may be in the form of tautomers. Accordingly, any reference to the compounds of formula (I) hereinbefore and hereinafter is to be understood, where applicable, as including also corresponding tautomers, even if the latter are not specifically mentioned in every case.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and, where applicable, their tautomers can form salts,<br>
for example acid addition salts. These acid addition salts are formed, for example, with strong inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, a phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic acid; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, CrC4alkanecarboxylic acids, for example acetic acid, un-saturated or saturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid or phthalic acid, hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid or citric acid, or benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, C1-C4alkane- or aryl-sulfonic acids, for example methane- or p-to!uene-sulfonic acid. Compounds of formula (I) that have at least one acidic group can furthermore form salts with bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts; or salts with ammonia or with an organic amine, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine or dimethylpropylamine, or a mono-, di- or trihydroxy-lower alkylamine, for example mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine. Corresponding internal salts may also be formed where appropriate. The free form is preferred. Among the salts of the compounds of formula (I), the agrochemically advantageous salts are preferred. Hereinbefore and hereinafter, any reference to the free compounds of formula (I) or their salts is to be understood as including, where appropriate, also the corresponding salts or the free compounds of formula (I), respectively. The same applies to tautomers of compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may be in the form of one of the possible isomers or in the form of a mixture thereof, in the form of pure isomers or in the form of an isomeric mixture, i.e. in the form of a diastereomeric mixture; the invention relates both to the pure isomers and to the diastereomeric mixtures and is to be interpreted accordingly hereinabove and hereinbelow, even if stereochemical details are not mentioned specifically in every case.<br>
The diastereomeric mixtures can be resolved into the pure isomers by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from a solvent, by chromatography, for example high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetylcellulose, with the aid of suitable microorganisms, by cleavage with specific, immobilised enzymes, or via the formation of inclusion compounds, for example using crown ethers, only one isomer being complexed.<br>
Apart from by separation of corresponding mixtures of isomers, pure diastereoisomers can be obtained according to the invention also by generally known methods of stereose-lective synthesis, for example by carrying out the process according to the invention using starting materials having correspondingly suitable stereochemistry.<br>
In each case it is advantageous to isolate or synthesise the biologically more active isomer, where the individual components have different biological activity.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained in the form of their hydrates and/or may include other solvents, for example solvents which may have been used for the crystallisation of compounds in solid form.<br>
The invention relates to all those embodiments of the process according to which a compound obtainable as starting material or intermediate at any stage of the process is used as starting material and all or some of the remaining steps are carried out, or in which a starting material is used in the form of a derivative and/or a salt and/or its diastereomers, or, especially, is formed under the reaction conditions. For instance compounds of formula (I) bearing a functional group in its free or protected form can be used as starting materials for the preparation of further compounds of formula (I). For such manipulations methods known to the person skilled in the art can be applied.<br>
In the processes of the present invention it is preferable to use those starting materials and intermediates which result in the compounds of formula (I) that are especially preferred.<br>
The invention relates especially to the preparation processes described in the Examples.<br>

In the area of pest control, the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention are active ingredients exhibiting valuable preventive and/or curative activity with a very advantageous biocidal spectrum and a very broad spectrum, even at low rates of concentration, while being well tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish and plants. They are, surprisingly, equally suitable for controlling both plant pests and ecto- and endo-parasites in humans and more especially in productive livestock, domestic animals and pets. They are effective against all or individual development stages of normally sensitive animal pests, but also of resistant animal pests, such as insects and representatives of the order Acarina, nematodes,<br>
cestodes and trematodes, while at the same time protecting useful organisms. The insecti-cidal or acaricidal activity of the active ingredients according to the invention may manifest itself directly, i.e. in the mortality of the pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during moulting, or indirectly, for example in reduced oviposition and/or hatching rate, good activity corresponding to a mortality of at least 50 to 60 %.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can be used to control, i.e. to inhibit or destroy, pests of the mentioned type occurring on plants, especially on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture, in horticulture and in forestry, or on parts of such plants, such as the fruits, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers or roots, while in some cases plant parts that grow later are still protected against those pests.<br>
Target crops include especially cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize and sorghum; beet, such as sugar beet and fodder beet; fruit, e.g. pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries and berries, e.g. strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils, peas and soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil, cocoa and groundnuts; cucurbitaceae, such as marrows, cucumbers and melons; fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp and jute; citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit<br>
and mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and paprika; lauraceae, such as avocado, cinnamon and camphor; and tobacco, nuts, coffee, aubergines, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas, natural rubber plants and ornamentals.<br>
Further areas of use of the compounds according to the invention are the protection of stored goods and storerooms and the protection of raw materials, and also in the hygiene sector, especially the protection of domestic animals and productive livestock against pests of the mentioned type, more especially the protection of domestic animals, especially cats and dogs, from infestation by fleas, ticks and nematodes.<br>
The invention therefore relates also to pesticidal compositions, such as emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, sp readable pastes, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dispersible powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules and encapsulations of polymer substances, that comprise at least one of the compounds according to the invention, the choice of formulation being made in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The active ingredient is used in those compositions in pure form, a solid active ingredient, for example, in a specific particle size, or preferably together with at least one of the adjuvants customary in formulation technology, such as extenders, e.g. solvents or solid carriers, or surface-active compounds (surfactants). In the area of parasite control in humans, domestic animals, productive livestock and pets it will be self-evident that only physiologically tolerable additives are used.<br>
Solvents are, for example: non-hydrogenated or partly hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably fractions C8 to C12 of alkylbenzenes, such as xylene mixtures, alkylated naphthalenes or tetrahydronaphthalene, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as paraffins or cyclohexane, alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and ethers and esters thereof, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol or ethylene glycol monomethyl or -ethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolid-2-one, dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide, water, non-epoxidized or epoxidized plant oils, such as non-epoxidized or epoxidized rapeseed, castor, coconut or soya oil, and silicone oils.<br>
The solid carriers used, for example for dusts and dispersible powders, are as a rule natural rock powders, such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. Highly disperse silicic acids or highly disperse absorbent polymers can also be added to improve<br>
the physical properties. Granular adsorptive granule carriers are porous types, such as pumice, crushed brick, sepiolite or bentonite, and non-sorbent carrier materials are calcite or sand. A large number of granular materials of inorganic or organic nature can furthermore be used, in particular dolomite or comminuted plant residues.<br>
Surface-active compounds are, depending on the nature of the active compound to be formulated, nonionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants or surfactant mixtures with good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The surfactants listed below are to be regarded only as examples; many other surfactants which are customary in formulation technology and are suitable according to the invention are described in the relevant literature.<br>
Nonionic surfactants are, in particular, polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cyclo-aliphatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, which can contain 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 9 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon radical and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical of the alkylphenols. Substances which are furthermore suitable are water-soluble polyethylene oxide adducts, containing 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups, on propylene glycol, ethylene diaminopolypropylene glycol and alkyl polypropylene glycol having 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. The compounds mentioned usually contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Examples are nonylphenol-polyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene-polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypoly-ethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Other substances are fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate.<br>
The cationic surfactants are, in particular, quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as substituents, at least one alkyl radical having 8 to 22 C atoms and, as further substituents, lower, non-halogenated or halogenated alkyl, benzyl or lower hydroxyalkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methyl-sulfates or ethyl-sulfates. Examples are stearyl-trimethyl-ammonium chloride and benzyl-di-(2-chloroethyl)-ethyI-ammonium bromide.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants can be both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds. Suitable soaps are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (Cio-Caz), such as the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of naturally occurring fatty acid mixtures, which can be obtained, for example, from coconut oil or tall oil; and furthermore<br>
also the fatty acid methyl-taurine salts. However, synthetic surfactants are more frequently used, in particular fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylarylsulfonates. The fatty sulfonates and sulfates are as a rule in the form of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts and in general have an alkyl radical of 8 to 22 C atoms, alkyl also including the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals; examples are the sodium or calcium salt of ligninsulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfuric acid ester or of a fatty alcohol sulfate mixture prepared from naturally occurring fatty acids. These also include the salts of sulfuric acid esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol-ethylene oxide adducts. The suifonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 sulfonic acid groups and a fatty acid radical having about 8 to 22 C atoms. Alkylarylsulfonates are, for example, the sodium, calcium or triethanolammonium salts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, of dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid-formaldehyde condensation product. Corresponding phosphates, such as salts of the phosphoric acid ester of a p-nonylphenol-(4-14)-ethylene oxide adduct or phospholipids, can further also be used.<br>
The compositions as a rule comprise 0.1 to 99 %, in particular 0.1 to 95 %, of active compound and 1 to 99.9 %, in particular 5 to 99.9 %, of - at least - one solid or liquid auxiliary, it being possible as a rule for 0 to 25 %, in particular 0.1 to 20 %, of the composition to be surfactants (% is in each case per cent by weight). While concentrated compositions are more preferred as commercial goods, the end user as a rule uses dilute compositions which comprise considerably lower concentrations of active compound. Preferred compositions comprise ingredients within the following ranges (% = per cent by weight):<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates:<br>
active ingredient:	1 to 90%, preferably 5 to 20%<br>
surfactant:	1 to 30%, preferably 10 to 20%<br>
solvent:	5 to 98%, preferably 70 to 85%<br>
Dusts:<br>
active ingredient:	0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 1%<br>
solid carrier:	99.9 to 90%, preferably 99.9 to 99%<br>
Suspension concentrates:<br>
active ingredient:	.	5 to 75%, preferably 10 to 50%<br>
water:	94 to 24%, preferably 88 to 30%<br>
surfactant:	1 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%<br>
Wettable powders:<br>
active ingredient:	0.5 to 90%, preferably 1 to 80%<br>
surfactant:	0.5 to 20%, preferably 1 to 15%<br>
solid carrier:	5 to 99%, preferably 15 to 98%<br>
Granules:<br>
active ingredient:	0.5 to 30%, preferably 3 to 15%<br>
solid carrier:	99.5 to 70%, preferably 97 to 85%<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also comprise further solid or liquid adjuvants, such as stabilisers, e.g. vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (e.g. epoxi-dised coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soybean oil), antifoams, e.g. silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and/or tackifiers as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients for obtaining special effects, e.g. acaricides, bactericides, fungicides, nematicides, mollus-cicides or selective herbicides.<br>
The crop protection products according to the invention are prepared in known manner, in the absence of adjuvants, e.g. by grinding, sieving and/or compressing a solid active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients, for example to a certain particle size, and in the presence of at least one adjuvant, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients with the adjuvant(s). The invention relates likewise to those processes for the preparation of the compositions according to the invention and to the use of the compounds of formula (I) in the preparation of those compositions.<br>
The invention relates also to the methods of application of the crop protection products, i.e. the methods of controlling pests of the mentioned type, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, coating, dressing, scattering or pouring, which are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances, and to the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the mentioned type. Typical rates of concentration are from 0.1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 0.1 to 500 ppm, of active ingredient. The rates of application per hectare are generally from 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, especially from 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 20 to 600 g/ha; more especially 20 to 100 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the area of crop protection is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application being dependent upon the risk of infestation by the pest in question. However, the active ingredient can also penetrate the plants through the roots (systemic action) when the locus of the plants is impregnated with a liquid formulation or when the active ingredient is incorporated in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example into the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application). In the case of paddy rice crops, such granules may be applied in metered amounts to the flooded rice field.<br>
The crop protection products according to the invention are also suitable for protecting plant propagation material, e.g. seed, such as fruits, tubers or grains, or plant cuttings, against animal pests. The propagation material can be treated with the composition before planting: seed, for example, can be dressed before being sown. The active ingredients according to the invention can also be applied to grains (coating), either by impregnating the seeds in a liquid formulation or by coating them with a solid formulation. The composition can also be applied to the planting site when the propagation material is being planted, for example to the seed furrow during sowing. The invention relates also to such methods of treating plant propagation material and to the plant propagation material so treated.<br>

In the data relating to NMR spectra, DMSO denotes dimethyl sulfoxide, s denotes singlet, t denotes triplet, d denotes doublet, q denotes quartet and m denotes multiplet.<br>
Preparation Examples<br>
In the following Examples, the preparation of avermectin B1 derivatives (mixtures of avermectin B1a and B1b derivative) is described. The B1b derivative generally represents about only from 5 to 10 % by weight of the mixtures and, for that reason, usually only the bands of the B1a derivative can be detected in the NMR spectrum.<br>
Since the compounds are in most cases in the form of mixtures of the avermectin B1 a and B1 b derivative, characterisation by means of the customary physical data such as melting point or refractive index is of little use. For that reason, the compounds are characterised by means of NMR spectroscopy following purification by chromatography, or by reference to the retention times determined in analysis by means of HPLC (high-resolution liquid chromatography). The term "B1a" in the physical data on the Preparation Examples refers to the main component, wherein R! is sec-butyl. "B1 b" represents the secondary<br>
component, wherein R^ is isopropyl. In the case of the compounds for which a retention time is given only for the B1a derivative, it is not possible to determine the retention time for the B1b component owing to the small proportion of B1b derivative. Allocation of the correct structures of the B1 a and B1 b components is carried out by mass spectrometry.<br>
The following method is used for the HPLC analysis:<br>
