THIOAMIDE DERIVATIVES<br>
Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin<br>
(Ig) supergene family, is expressed on activated, but not resting, endothelium. The integrin VLA-4 (a4b1), which is expressed on many cell types including<br>
circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, but not neutrophils, is the principal receptor for VCAM-1. Antibodies to VCAM-1 or VLA-4 can block the adhesion of these mononuclear leukocytes, as well as melanoma cells, to activated endothelium in vitro. Antibodies to either protein have been effective at inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and preventing tissue damage in several animal models of inflammation. Anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to block T-cell emigration in adjuvant-induced arthritis, prevent eosinophil accumulation and bronchoconstriction in models of asthma, and reduce paralysis and inhibit monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to prolong the survival time of cardiac allografts. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-VLA-4 mAbs can prevent insulitis and diabetesin non-obese diabetic mice, and significantly attenuate inflammation in the cotton-top tamarin model of colitis.<br>
Thus, compounds which inhibit the interaction between α4-containing integrins and VCAM-1 will be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammation resulting from chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br>

The compounds of the invention inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and rnonocytes ("VLA-4-expressing cells"). The binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on such cells is known to be implicated in certain disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and particularly in the binding of eosinophils to pulmonary endothelium which contributes to the cause of the pulmonary inflammation which occurs in asthma. Thus, the compounds of the present invention would be useful a medicaments, especially for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, especially, asthma.<br>
On the basis of their capability of inhibiting binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, the compounds of the invention can be used as medicament for the treatment of disorders which are known to be associated with such binding. Examples of such disorders are rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. The compounds of the invention are preferably used in the treatment of diseases which involve pulmonary inflammation, such as asthma. The pulmonary inflammation, which occurs in asthma, is related to eosinophil infiltration into the lungs wherein the eosinophils bind to endothelium which has been activated by some asthma-triggering event or substance.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the invention also inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and MadCAM to the cellular receptor alpha4-beta7, also known as LPAM, which is expressed on lymphocytes, eosinophils and T-cells. While the precise role of alpha4-beta7 interaction with various ligands in inflammatory conditions such as asthma is not completely understood, compounds of the<br><br>
invention which inhibit both alpha4-betal and alpha4-beta7 receptor binding are particularly effective in animal models of asthma. Furthermore work with monoclonal antibodies to alpha4-beta7 indicate that compounds which inhibit alpha4-beta7 binding to MadCAM or VCAM are useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They would also be useful in the treatment of other diseases in which such binding is implicated as a cause of disease damage or symptoms.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered orally, rectally, or parentally, e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally or transdermally; or sublingually, or as opthalmalogical preparations, or as an aerosol in the case of pulmonary inflammation. Capsules, tablets, suspensions or solutions for oral administration, suppositories, injection solutions, eye drops, salves or spray solutions are examples of administration forms.<br>
Intravenous, intramuscular, oral or inhalation administration is a preferred form of use. The dosages in which the compounds of the invention are administered in effective amounts depending on the nature of the specific active ingredient, the age and the requirements of the patient and the mode of administration. Dosages may be determined by any conventional means, e.g., by dose-limiting clinical trials. Thus, the invention further comprises a method of treating a host suffering from a disease in which VCAM-1 of fibronectin binding to VLA-4-expressing cells is a causative factor in the disease symptoms or damage by administering an amount of a compound of the invention sufficient to inhibit VCAM-1 or fibronectin binding to VLA-4-expressing cells so that said symptoms or said damage is reduced. In general, dosages of about 0.1-100 mg/kg body weight per day are preferred, with dosages of 1-25 mg/kg per day being particularly preferred, and dosages of 1-10 mg/kg body weight per day being especially preferred.<br>
The invention further comprises in another embodiment pharmaceutical compositions which contain a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, including salts and esters thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be formulated by any conventional means. In this regard the present invention relates in a further embodiment to a process for the production of a pharmaceutical preparation, especially a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment or prophylaxis of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma comprising<br><br>
bringing one or more compounds according to the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with a compatible pharmaceutical carrier material. Tablets or granulates can contain a series of binders, fillers, carriers or diluents. Liquid compositions can be, for example, in the form of a sterile water-miscible solution. Capsules can contain a filler or thickener in addition to the active ingredient. Furthermore, flavor-improving additives as well as substances usually used as preserving, stabilizing, moisture-retaining and emulsifying agents as well as salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers and other additives can also be present.<br>
The previously mentioned carrier materials and diluents can comprise any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic substances, e.g., water, gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arable, polyalkylene glycols and the like.<br>
Oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, preferably contain from 25 mg to 1000 mg of a compound of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any<br>
conventional means. In reaction Scheme 1, a 4-nitro-L-phenylalanine derivative of formula 1 in which R1 is lower alkyl, which is a known compound or readily<br>
prepared by conventional means, is acylated with a benzoic acid derivative of<br>
formula 2 in which R2 hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, cycloalkyl, aryl,<br>
arylalkyl, nitro, cyano, lower alkylthio, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkyl sulfonyl,<br>
lower alkanoyl, halogen, or perfluorolower alkyl, R3 is hydrogen, halogen or lower alkyl and R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, aryl, nitro, cyano,<br>
lower alkyl sulfonyl, or halogen, using conventional means for amide bond formation. For example, a compound of formula 2 may be converted to the corresponding acid chloride and condensed with a compound of formula 1 in the presence of a proton acceptor such as a tertiary alkylamine. Alternatively compound 1 can be coupled with a carboxylic acid of formula 2 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 °C and room temperature to give a compound of formula 3.<br>
Conversion of the compound of formula 3 to the corresponding thioamide of formula 4 can be carried out by treatment with Lawesson's reagent which is (2,4-<br><br>
bis(4-methoxyhenyl)-13-ciithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide]. The procedure is standard and has been described in detail. See for example, Scheibey, S., Pedersen, B. S., Lawesson, S.-O. Bull Soc. Chim. Belg. 1978 57,222 and Cava, M. P„ Levinson, M. I., Tetrahedron 1985, 41 5061. The nitro group of the compound of formula 4 maybe reduced to the corresponding amine by any of the conventional means which are compatible with thioamides. One convenient procedure employs zinc dust as the reducing agent in the presence of methanol, ammonium chloride and water at a temperature of from 35 to 60 'C to give a compound of formula 5. Acylation of this compound with an aryl- or heteroaryl carboxylic acid of formula 6 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 °C and room temperature gives a compound of formula 7. In certain cases, for example with hindered carboxylic acids 6, it may be advantageous to form the corresponding acid halide and react it with the amine of formula 5, typically in the presence of a slight excess of a base such as a tertiary amine or 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine. The carboxylic acid of formula 6 may be substituted by halogen, nitro, lower alkyl sulfonyl, cyano, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, lower alkyl aminosulfonyl, perfluorolower alkyl, lower alkylthio, hydroxy lower alkyl, alkoxy lower alkyl, alkylthio lower alkyl, alkylsulfmyl lower alkyl, alkylsufonyl lower alkyl, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkanoyl, aroyl, aryl, aryloxy. Where appropriate, it may also incorporate suitably protected reactive functionalities which must be removed to permit final conversion into compounds of the invention. The choice and use of such groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Guidance for the selection and use of protecting groups is provided in standard reference works, for example: "T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd edition, Wiley Interscience, New York, 1991. The ester moiety of compound 7 can generally be cleaved to the corresponding carboxylic acid by treatment with an alkali metal hdyroxide, for example, lithium hydroxide in aqueous methanol at a temperature of from room temperature to 50 'C. Depending on the nature of R1, alternative procedures may be preferred. The choice of conditions for ester cleavage in the presence of functionalities such as thioamides is well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br><br>
Ortho-substituted benzoic acid derivatives which are not commercially available can be prepared by conventional means. For example ortho-substituted aryl iodides or triflates may be carbonylated in the presence of carbon monoxide and a suitable palladium catalyst. The preparation of such iodide or triflate intermediates is dependent on the particular substitution pattern desired and they may be obtained by direct iodination or diazotization of an aniline followed by treatment with a source of iodide for example, potassium iodide. Triflates may be derived from the corresponding phenols by conventional means such as treatment with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in an inert solvent. Other means of obtaining ortho-substituted benzoic acids involves treatment of an 2-methoxyphenyloxazoline derivative such as 9 with an alkyl Grignard reagent<br><br>
followed by hydrolysis of the oxazoline ring following the general procedure described by Meyers, A. L, Gabel, R., Mihelick, E. D, I. Org. Chem. 1978,43, 1372-1379., to give an acid of formula 10, 2- or 2,6-Disubstituted benzonitriles also serve as convenient precursors to the corresponsing benzoic acids. In the case of highly hindered nitriles, for example 2-chloro-6-methylbenzonitrile, conventional hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions is difficult and better results are obtained by DIBAL reduction to the corresponding benzaldehyde followed by oxidation using a sodium chlorite/hydroperoxide oxidizing reagent.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
For the synthesis of analogues a branched chain or cycloalkyl moiety, a similar procedure to that described in scheme 1 can be employed starting with the appropriate branched chain or cycloalkyl carboxylic acid of formula 12. In this case, R6 represents is lower alkyl, unsubstituted or fluorine substituted lower alkenyl, or a substituted lower alkyl group wherein the substituents may be chosen from aryl, heteroaryl, azido, cyano, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkylthio, lower alkyl sulfonyl, perfluoro lower alkanoyl, nitro, or a protected amino group. The amine protecting group must be chosen to be compatible with the reagents needed to convert carboxamides to<br><br>
thioamides. Carbamates, for example, the tert-butoxycarbonyl moiety are suitable. As appropriate, these protecting groups may be removed by conventional means later in the synthesis and the resulting free amine can be further functionalized utilizing standard methods. For example, the amine can be acylated by treatment with the appropriate anhydride, isocyanate or acid halide.<br><br>
The synthesis of imidazolidinones of formula 21 is described in reaction scheme 3. An aminophenylalanine derivative of structure 13 in which R6 is aryl,<br>
heteroaryl, branched chain alkyl or derived from a compound of formula 12, and R7 is lower alkyl, is coupled with a N-protected Q-amino acid of formula 14, in<br>
which R8 can be a natural or unnatural, D- or L-α-amino acid side chain and R9<br>
is a nitrogen protecting group of the type conventionally used in peptide<br>
chemistry, for example, a Fmoc group, using standard peptide coupling<br>
conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic<br>
solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 °C and room temperature to<br>
give a compound of formula 15. Depending on the nature of protecting group R9, an appropriate deprotection method is employed to give compound of<br>
formula 16. In the case of the protecting group R9 is Fmoc group, it may be<br>
removed from 15 using standard base treatment well known to those practicing<br>
peptide chemistry, for example with piperidine in DMF, to afford an amine of formula 16. The compound 16 can then react with an aldehyde 17, in which R10<br>
is lower alkyl, aryl, or aryl lower alkyl, in the presence of a water scavenger such<br>
as 4A molecular sieves in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane or<br>
THF at 25-60 °C to give an imine of formula 18. The imine 18 may then be<br>
treated with an acylating agent such as the acyl chloride of formula 19 in which Rl 1 can be an alkyl or aryl group in the presence of a base such DIPEA or DBU <br>
in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane or THF at 25-60 °C to give an acyl imidazolidinone of formula 20. Alternatively, other reactive acylating groups such as acid anhydrides or mixed anhydrides may be employed in this reaction. Compound 20 may be converted to a compound of the invention by an appropriate hydrolysis procedure, for example by hydrolysis by treatment with<br><br>
an alkali metal hydroxide, for example sodium hydroxide in aqueous alcohol to give, after acidification, a carboxylic acid of formula 21.<br>

1.      VLA-4 / VCAM-1 Screening Assay<br>
VLA-4 antagonist activity, defined as ability to compete for binding to immobilized VCAM-1, was quantitated using a solid-phase, dual antibody ELISA. VLA-4 (a4pi integrin) bound to VCAM-1 is detected by a complex of anti-integrin Pl antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG: chromogenic substrate (K-Blue). Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with recombinant human VCAM-1 (0.4 jig in 100 \x\ PBS), sealing each plate and then allowing the plates to stand at 4°C for ' 18 hr. The VCAM-coated plates were subsequently blocked with 250 µl of 1% BSA/0.02% NaN3 to reduce nonspecific binding. On the day of assay, all plates are washed twice with VCAM Assay Buffe (200µl/well of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCb,<br>
0.05% Tween 20; pH 7.4). Test compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted 1:20 in VCAM Assay Buffer supplemented with Img/mL BSA (i.e., final DMSO = 5%), A series of 1:4 dilutions are performed to achieve a concentration range of 0,005 nM - 1.563 µM for each test compound. 100 µl per well of each dilution is added to the VCAM-coated plates, followed by 10 µl of Ramos cell-derived VLA-4. These plates are sequentially mixed on a platform shaker for 1 min, incubated for 2 hr at 37 °C, and then washed four times with 200 µl/well VCAM Assay Buffer. 100µlof mouse anti-human integrin Pl antibody is added to each well (0.6µg/mL in VCAM Assay Buffer + Img/mL BSA) and allowed to incubate for 1 hr at 37X. At the conclusion of this incubation period, all plates are washed four times with VCAM Assay Buffer (200 fil/well). A corresponding second antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (100 |il per well @ 1:800 dilution in VCAM Assay Buffer + Img/mL BSA), is then added to each well, followed by a 1 hr incubation at room temperature and concluded by three washes (200µl/well) with VCAM Assay Buffer. Color development is initiated by addition of 100µ K-Blue per well (15 min incubation, room temp) and terminated by addition of 100 µl Red Stop Buffer per well. All plates are then read in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 650 nM. Results are calculated as % inhibition of total binding (i.e., VLA-4 -h VCAM-1 in the absence of test compound).

maintained in a solution containing 0.1 M Tris-glycine (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.02% 0.02% NaNs and 10 pg/mL leupeptin. Calcein-<br>
AM was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc.<br>
Methods:<br>
VLA-4 (a4Pl integrin) antagonist activity, defined as ability to compete with cell-surface VLA-4 for binding to immobilized VCAM-1, was quantitated using a Ramos-VCAM'l cell adhesion assay. Ramos cells bearing cell-surface VLA-4, were labeled with a fluorescent dye (Calcein-AM) and allowed to bind VCAM-1 in the presence or absence of test compounds. A reduction in fluorescence intensity associated with adherent cells (% inhibition) reflected competitive inhibition of VLA-4 mediated cell adhesion by the test compound.<br>
Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with recombinant human VCAM-1 (100 ng in 100 \x\ PBS), sealing each plate and allowing the plates to stand at 4°C for "18 hr. The VCAM-coated plates were subsequently washed twice with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, and then blocked for Ihr (room temperature) with 200 µl of Blocking Buffer (1% BSA/0.02% thimerosal) to reduce non-specific binding. Following the incubation with Blocking Buffer, plates were inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer aspirated. Each plate was then washed with 300 |al PBS, inverted and the remaining PBS aspirated.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted 1:25 in VCAM Cell Adhesion Assay Buffer (4 mM CaCb, 4 mM MgCb in 50 mM TRIS-HCl,<br>
pH 7.5) (final DMSO = 4%). A series of eight 1:4 dilutions were performed for each compound (general concentration range of 1 nM - 12,500 nM). 100 µl/well of each dilution was added to the VCAM-coated plates, followed by 100 µl of Ramos cells (200,000 cells/well in 1% BSA/PBS). Plates containing test compounds and Ramos cells were allowed to incubate for 45 min at room temperature, after which 165 (al/well PBS was added. Plates were inverted to remove non-adherent cells, blotted and 300 µl/well PBS added. Plates were again inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer gently aspirated. 100 µl Lysis Buffer<br><br>
(0.1% SDS in 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.5) was added to each well and agitated for 2 min on a rotary shaking platform. The plates were then read for fluorescence intensity on a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore) fluorescence measurement system (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 530 nm).<br>
3.      MadCAM RPMI 8866 cell Based Assay<br>
MadCAM binding activity was quantified using an RPMI 8866 cell-based assay. RPMI 8866 cells bearing cell surface MadCAM were labelled with fluorescent dye (calcein AM) and and allowed to bind MadCAM in the presence or absence of test compounds. A reduction in fluoresence intensity associated with adherent cells (96 inhibition) reflects competitive inhibition of MadCAM mediated cell adhesion by the test compound.<br>
Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc F96 Maxisorp) with 25 ng/well of MadCAM (100 µl/well in coating buffer: lOmM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, 0,8 g/L sodium carbonate, 1.55 g/L sodium bicarbonate, adjusted to pH 9.6 with IN HCL), sealing and wrapping each plate and refrigerating the plates for at least 24 hrs. The MadCAM-coated plates were subsequently washed twice with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, and then blocked for at least Ihr. at room temperature with of blocking buffer (1% nonfat dry milk in PBS) to reduce non-specific binding. Following the incubation with blocking buffer, plates were washed with PBS, hand blotted, and the remaining liquid aspirated.<br>
RPMI 8866 cells (2x106 cells/ml x 10 ml. per plate x number of plates) were transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube filled with PBS and spun at 200 x g for 8 minutes, after which the PBS is poured off and the pellet resuspended to 10 x 10 cells/ml in PBS. Calcein (diluted with 200 µl DMSO from a 5 mg/ml frozen stock) was added to the cells at 5µl/ml PBS. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 30 min. in the dark, the cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 2 x 106 cells/ml in cell buffer (RPMI 1640 medium (no additives)).<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted 1:25 in binding buffer (1.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2 in 50 mM TRIS-HCI, adjusted to pH 7.5<br>
with NaOH). Remaining dilutions were into dilution buffer (4% DMSO in binding buffer — 2% DMSO final when diluted 1:2 in wells). A series of dilutions were performed for each compound tested. 129 µl of binding buffer was placed in the first row of wells in the MadCAM-coated plates. 100 |il/well of dilution buffer was added to the remaining wells, followed by 5.4 µl of each test compound in the<br><br>
appropriate dilution (in triplicate). 100 µl of cells (200,000 cells/well) were added. Control wells contained 100µl dilution buffer + 100µl cell buffer, and 100µ dilution buffer T 100 µl cell buffer. Plates were allowed to incubate for 45 min at room temperature, after which 150 µl/well PBS was added. Plates were inverted to remove non-adherent cells, blotted and 200µl/well PBS added. Plates were again inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer gently aspirated. 100 µl PBS was added to each well The plates were then read for fluorescence intensity on a fluorescence measurement system (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 530 nm, sensitivity = 2).

Airway inflammation in the monkey was determined using a modification of the protocol described by Turner et al. (Turner et al., 1994). Adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, Hazelton Labs, Denver, PA) weighing between 3.6 - 5.8 kg were used in these studies. All animals exhibited positive skin and airway responses to Ascaris suum antigen and had at least a 3-fold increase in the sensitivity to methacholine (MCh) when subjected to an aerosol of ascaris extract.<br>
On the day of each experiment the animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride, 12 mg/kg, and xylazine, 0.5 mg/kg, intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube (3 mm, Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, MO), then seated in an upright position in a specially designed Plexiglass chair (Plas-Labs, Lansing, MI). The endotracheal tube was connected to a heated Fleisch pneumotachograph. Airflow was measured via a Validyn differential pressure transducer (DP 45-24) that was attached to the pneumotachograph. Transpulmonary pressure was measured via a second Validyne transducer (DP 45-24) connected between a sidearm of the tracheal cannula and a 18-gauge intrapleural needle inserted in the intercostal space located below the left nipple. Recordings of pressure and flow and the calculation of RL were made using the Modular Instruments data acquisition system as described above. Baseline RL was measured for all animals on the day of each experiment and had an average value of about 0.04 cmH20/ml/sec.<br>
Protocol<br>
Airway inflammation was induced by exposing the animal to an aerosol of A. Suum extract for 60 sec. The aerosol was delivered via a nebulizer (De Vilbiss Model 5000, Healt Care Inc., Somerset, PA) that was attached to the endotracheal tube. The concentration of extract was predetermined for each animal (500 to 50,000 PNU) and caused at least a doubling in the airway resistance. At 24 hour    -after the antigen challenge, the animals were anesthetized as described previously and placed on a stainless steel table. Airway inflammation was assessed by inserting a pediatric bronchoscope into the airway lumen down to about the 4 or 5th generation bronchi and gently lavaging with 3 X 2 ml aliquots of sterile Hanks Balanced Salt Solution. The recovered lavage fluid then was analyzed for the total cell and differential cell counts using standard hematological techniques.<br><br>
Drug Treatment<br>
The animals received drug or a vehicle, p.o., administered 2 hours prior to antigen challenge. The compound of example 1 caused a significant decrease in the number and percent of inflammatory cells present in the lavage fluid relative to vehicle treated control animals.<br><br><br><br>
