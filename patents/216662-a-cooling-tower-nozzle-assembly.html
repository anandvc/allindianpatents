				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a cooling tower nozzle assembly which may be fixed to the outlet of any known cooling tower structure.<br>
Cooling towers are used to cool water that circulates through condensors. Conventionally, water flowing out from condensing chambers is allowed to trickle down through wooden stats in order to expose a large sur&amp;ce of hot water flowing out therefrom to atmospheric cooling.<br>
This invention is aimed at increasing the cooling rate by affording a wider spread area at a given cooling tower head. The cooling tower nozzle according to this invention is designed to increase the flow rate of water per given head. The use of wooden slats for cooling enhances algae forming and is not cost effective considering the high price of wood. Conventional cooling systems have metal fasteners such as bolts and nuts which tend to loosen due to constant water pressure. The cooling tower nozzle developed by us is preferably made of with plastic, moulded components which reduce wear and tear and are easily replaceable.<br>
The cooling tower nozzle consists of four parts (1) the adapter which consists of a hollow cylindrical body having a curved opening at one end. The adapter is provided with internal threading at the other end. (2) A connector is a hollow cylindrical body which is threadedly connectble to<br><br>
the adapter. It has internal threading at one end and external threading at the other end. The external threading aligns with the internal threading of the adapter. (3) The nozzle consists of hollow cylindrical body with a tapered opening at one end which is externally threaded to correspond with the internal threading of the connector. A flat plate has support members on which the hollow cylindrical body of the adapter is fixedly mounted. The base plate has a tubular downwardly projecting part with external threading thereon. (4) A splash plate which is the fourth component of the nozzle assembly consists of a circular plate having a centrally located opening which extends downwardly to form a short stem. This stem is internally threaded to correspond with the downwardly projected portion of the nozzle assembly. The circular plate extends upwardly and outwardly from the central opening to produce a caved - in effect.<br>
The cooling tower nozzle assembly according to this invention comprises an adapter connected to a nozzle and splash plate through a connector, said nozzle has a tapered opening at one end and a base member at the other end said splash plate is slantingly disposed towards a central opening which is provided with a downwardly extending projection to accommodate said base member of the nozzle.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to Figure I and Figure II of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure I shows the different components of the assembly separately where as Figure II shows the assembled unit.<br>
The adapter is represented by A which is hollow cylindrical body with an opening capable of aligning with the pipe to which it is to be fitted. This opening may be slightly curved to suit the curvative of the opening of the pipe. The lower part of the adapter is internally threaded to align with the external threading of the connector C. The connector C is internally threaded at its lower end which aligns with the external threading of nozzle represented by reference letter N. The nozzle N has a tapered opening and is supported on a base plate B with support means shown by S. Support means may be a plurality of rods or ribs extending from the base member B. The base plate has a downward projection which is threaded externally and is represented by P. This projection aligns with the downward projection P1 of the central opening (O) of the splash plate SP. This downward projection is internally threaded to correspond with the external threading of the projection P from the base plate.<br><br>
This nozzle of this invention is connected to a pipe which disperses hot water from condensors. Water coming from the top of the tower flows down towards the bottom and hits the base plate and is guided by the splash plate to distribute the same in a circular pattern around the nozzle. The wider spread area offers better and more efficient cooling of the water flow.<br>
The components of the assembly may be made out of thermostable plastic materials. However metals and alloys conventionally used for nozzle making may also be effectively used in making the nozzle assembly.<br>
Though this invention has been described and illustrated with reference to a specific embodiments, obvious alterations and modifications are within its scope and that of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A cooling tower nozzle assembly comprising an adapter (A) connected to a nozzle (N) and a splash plate (SP) through a connector (C), said nozzle has a tapered opening at one end and a base member (B) at the other, said splash plate is slantingly disposed towards a central opening (O) which is provided with a downwardly extending projection (P1) to accommodate said base member of the nozzle.<br>
2.	The nozzle assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the adapter has a hollow cylindrical body with a mouth at one end connectable to the outlet of cooling tower, said adapter being provided with internal threading at the other end.<br>
3.	The nozzle assembly as claimed in claims I and 2, herein said connector is a hollow tubular body provided with external threading for aligning with the internal dreading of said adaptor and internal threading for aligning with the external threading at the mouth of the nozzle.<br>
4.	The nozzle assembly as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein said nozzle is a hollow tubular body with a tapered opening at one end, and is externally threaded for aligning with the internal threading of the<br><br>
said adapter, support members (s) connecting the base member to the nozzle body, said base member having an externally threaded downward projection to align with the internal threadings provided within the downwardly extending projectioa of said splash plate.<br>
5.	The nozzle assembly as claimed in claims 1  to 4, wherein the<br>
components are made of thermo stable plastic.<br>
6.	A coooling tower nozzle assembly substantially as herein described<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.</td>
