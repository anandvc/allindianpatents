				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
VIA FILLED INTERCONNECT FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of power generation and in<br>
particular to an improved interconnect for a solid oxide fuel cell.<br>
2. Background of the Invention<br>
Global demand for power generation in the next twenty years is expected to increase<br>
by about 2 million MW, of which 490,000 M\V are projected to be powered by natural gas.<br>
Utility deregulation in the United States, concerns over health issues and capital costs<br>
associated with the transmission and distribution of electrical power make it likely that at<br>
least 30% of this natural gas fired capacity will he provided by modular power plants located<br>
in close proximity to the end users.<br>
Solid oxide fuel cells are an attractive solution for meeting those needs for distributed<br>
power in a manner which is both energy efficient and environmentally sound. Solid oxide<br>
fuel cells offer modularity as well as higher fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and less noise<br>
and vibration than gas turbines or diesel generators. Data from test modules show that Nox<br>
production is greatly reduced and almost non-existent in fuel cells. At the same time, fuel<br>
cell test modules have been tested to operate at greater than 50% efficiency.<br>
In order to be widely accepted by delivering energy efficiently and in an<br>
environmentally sound manner, solid oxide fuel cells must be able to cost-effectively produce<br>
electricity and heat. The capital and operating costs of solid oxide fuel cells must compare<br>
favorably with alternative sources for distributed power, such as internal combustion engines<br>
and gas turbines.<br>
Interconnect functionality and cost are two of the biggest barriers to producing market<br>
competitive solid oxide fuel cell generators. The interconnect must provide reactant gas<br>
separation and containment, mechanical support to the cells and a low resistance path for<br>
current connecting the cells electrically in series and/or in parallel. Meetinc these functional<br>
requirements remains a challenge. Monolithic interconnects made of lanthanum chromite<br>
and high chromium alloys have been used with some success. However, both types are quite<br>
expensive and compromise aspects of the interconnect function.<br>
Lanthanum chromite and high chromium alloys are currently cost prohibitive for use<br>
in commercial products with a conventional monolithic interconnect design. Projected costs,<br>
assuming high production volumes using net shape ceramic processing or a metal forming<br>
process, are potentially low enough to enable marginally cost competitive solid oxide fuel cell<br>
power generation. However, the gap between required startup cost and initial market size is a<br>
decisive barrier to solid oxide fuel cell commercialization.<br>
Gas separation requires a dense impermeable material which does not have significant<br>
ionic conductivity. Alloy interconnects that have been developed readily satisfy this<br>
requirement. Ceramic processing has developed the capability to produce interconnects of<br>
sufficiently high density, however, many compositions have unacceptably high ionic<br>
conductivity. The known compositions of such ceramics possessing low ionic conductivity<br>
also have less than acceptable electronic conductivity or are not well matched to the<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the cell.<br>
Matching cell and interconnect coefficients of thermal expansion allows sealing of<br>
cells to interconnects for gas containment. Alloy interconnects generally have a higher CTE<br>
than the CTE of the cell. While the CTE of ceramic interconnects are more nearly matched<br>
than alloy interconnects, they are still lower than that of the cell. As a result, regions of the<br>
cell may be adversely displaced wherein it becomes difficult to effectively confine reactant<br>
gases to their intended flow paths, which in turn adversely affects the stack efficiency. While<br>
changes between room and operating temperatures produce the largest thermal displacements,<br>
temperature changes in a stack as reactant and current flows are varied can also create<br>
undesirable detrimental displacements.<br>
Dissimilar thermal expansion characteristics also cause the relative motion imparted<br>
by thermal expansion to disrupt the electrical current path between the electrodes and<br>
interconnects. The contact resistance generated in this way significantly reduces stack<br>
performance and efficiency. Tn the case of alloy interconnects, the motion can dislodge a<br>
protective oxide scale and expose underlying unprotected material. Oxidation of the<br>
unprotected material increases the overall scale thickness, and as scale conductivity is<br>
comparatively poor, scale growth contributes directly to performance degradation.<br>
The issues presented by oxide scale conductivity and growth are some of the most<br>
challenging of all those confronting developers of metal interconnects. Scale resistance is a<br>
function of oxide conductivity, thickness and continuity. Porous or laminar scales have the<br>
effect of increasing the current path length while reducing the effective current carrying cross<br>
sectional area. The mechanism for scale conductivity and growth are related such that scale<br>
growth rate increases with scale conductivity. Higher growth rates generally produce less<br>
dense, less adherent scales. Any alloy (other than noble or semi-noble metals) will have to<br>
compromise scale conductivity in order to control degradation due to scale growth. Coating<br>
the interconnect with a conductive oxide layer provides more control of the scale composition<br>
and microstructure but does not change the basic nature of the problem.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an interconnect for a solid<br>
oxide fuel cell which permits substantial matching of cell and interconnect coefficients of<br>
thermal expansion.<br>
Tt is a further object of the invention to provide an interconnect region manufactured<br>
using vias to fill the interconnect space between the cell anode and cathode to match the<br>
material coefficients of thermal expansion.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to separate the interconnect functions of gas<br>
separation and containment, from the current carrying function of the interconnect, thereby<br>
enabling selection of materials best suited to each function and atmosphere.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises an interconnect for a solid oxide fuel cell comprising<br>
a gas separator plate and at least one fill material. The gas separator plate includes at least<br>
one via extending therethrough. The at least one fill material is positioned within the at least<br>
one via and is operatively associated with at least one of a cathode or an anode.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the interconnect includes at least an anode contact<br>

portions of the fill material, and that the respective coefficients of thermal expansion are the<br>
same or substantially similar<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is<br>
shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail, one specific embodiment, with<br>
the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the<br>
principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiment<br>
illustrated.<br>
A portion of solid oxide fuel cell stack 10 is shown in Fig. 1 as comprising a<br>
monolithic structure that includes a plurality of trilayer cells, such as trilayer cell 15 and a<br>
via-filled interconnect such as via-filled interconnect 17 positioned between any two trilayer<br>
cells. While the embodiment of Fig. 1 is shown as comprising a stack having three trilayer<br>
cells and two interconnects, it is likewise contemplated that, depending on the requirements<br>
for the particular application, a particular cell may comprise any number of trilayer cells (and<br>
corresponding interconnects) having any one of a number of varying shapes and sizes.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, each trilayer cell, such as trilayer cell ! 5, includes anode 40,<br>
electrolyte 41 and cathode 42. As will be understood, the anode, the electrolyte and the<br>
cathode may comprise a variety of combinations of materials which are well known in the art.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, each via-filled interconnect, such as via-filled interconnect<br>
17 (Fig. 2) comprises gas separator plate 22, fill material 24, cathode contact 26, anode<br>
contact 28 and seals 30, 32 (Fig. 1). Gas separator plate 22, as shown in Figs 1-3, comprises<br>
a ceramic material which includes a plurality of vias, such as via 60. Gas separator plate may<br>
comprise a single or multi-layer ceramic substrate. Moreover, many different ceramic<br>
compositions may be utilized for the gas separator plate, so long as they are gas impermeable,<br>
have minimal ionic conductivity and can withstand the operating temperatures of the fuel<br>
cell, as will be understood by one of skill in the art. For example, and while not limited<br>
thereto, the interconnect may comprise a yttria stabilized zirconia, such as 3 mole percent<br>
Y2O3(3YSO).<br>
Vias, such as via 60, are shown in Figs. 2-4 as comprising openings that extend<br>
through the one or more layers that comprise the gas separator plate 22. Various dimensions<br>
and shapes of the via are contemplated, as well as both uniform and non-uniform cross-<br>
sectional configurations.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, fill material 24 includes cathode via fill 36 and anode via fill 38,<br>
both of which are positioned within each of vias 60. The cathode via fill and the anode via<br>
fill 38 connect at interface 65, to, in turn, provide an electrical connection through the<br>
interconnect.<br>
While other configurations are contemplated, the anode fill material has a coefficient<br>
of thermal expansion closely matched with the anode contact. Similarly, the cathode fill<br>
material has a coefficient of thermal expansion closely matched with the cathode contact.<br>
Thus, as the cell operates and thermally expands/contracts, the cell will be free from<br>
undesirable distortion. The particular materials utilized for the cathode and the anode fill<br>
material will vary and will generally depend on the cathode/anode material that is utilized.<br>
For example, cathode via fill 36 may comprise lanthanum strontium manganite, a mixture of<br>
PLANSEE and LSMC or a mixture of LSMC and LSCo. Anode via fill 38 may comprise<br>
nickel, silver-palladium alloy or a mixture of PLANSHE and LSMC or a mixture of<br>
PLANSEE and LSMC. In addition, in certain situations, it is contemplated that both the<br>
cathode fill material and the anode fill material may comprise an identical composition, in<br>
which case the vias are filled with a single material composition, such as doped chromite,<br>
silver-palladium or PLANSEE.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1-3, cathode via fill 36 is electrically connected with cathode contact<br>
26. In particular, as shown in Fig. 1, the cathode contact, through a cathode bond layer 47, is,<br>
in turn, bonded to cathode -12" of trilayer cell 15". Similarly, anode via fill 38 is electrically<br>
connected with the anode contact 28. The anode contact, through anode bond layer 45, is, in<br>
turn bonded to anode 40' of another one of the trilayer cells, such as trilayer cell 15'. While<br>
various materials for each of the cathode contact and the anode contact are contemplated,.the<br>
anode contact may comprise nickel, PLANSEE, silver-palladium or LSMC and the cathode<br>
contact may comprise silver palladium, lanthanum strontium manganite, LSM or LSCo.<br>
As also shown in Fig. 1, the relative positioning of the anode contacts between the<br>
anode and the gas separator plate defines passageway 52 which facilitates the passage of fuel<br>
therethrough. Similarly, the relative positioning of the cathode contacts between the cathode<br>
and the gas separator plate defines passageway 50 which facilitates the passage of air<br>
therethrough. Seal 30 and seal 32 prevent the air and the fuel, respectively, from undesirably<br>
exiting from the respective air and fuel passages. While other materials are contemplated, the<br>
seals may comprise a material substantially similar to that of gas separator plate 22.<br>
The manufacture of the cell comprises the assembly of the desired quantity of trilayer<br>
cells with the required interconnects. As shown schematically in Fig. 5, the interconnects are<br>
manufactured by first selecting the contemplated material for gas separator plate 22. Once<br>
separator plate 22 is formed, vias 60 are formed therethrough. One particular pattern for the<br>
vias 60 is shown in Fig. 4. Of course, various other patterns for the positioning and<br>
orientation of vias that extend through separator plate 22 are likewise contemplated.<br>
Once the vias are formed through separator plate 22, cathode via fill 36 and anode via<br>
fill material 38 are each selected. As explained above, the materials are selected based upon<br>
their relative coefficients of thermal expansion and the coefficient of thermal expansion of the<br>
respective anode or cathode material (or anode contact and cathode contact material). Once<br>
selected, the anode via fill and the cathode via fill are introduced into each via. While other<br>
processes are contemplated, one manner in which to introduce the fill into each via comprises<br>
the filling of the via with a desired cathode metal ink 80 and a desired anode metal ink 82 and<br>
subsequently sintering the material to density. Where the anode via fill and the cathode via<br>
fill comprise identical materials, a single material is introduced in1o the entire via. Once the<br>
vias have been filled with the appropriate fill material, anode contact 28 and cathode contact<br>
26, respectively, are connected to complete the assembly of the interconnect. Lastly, the<br>
interconnects, the seals and the trilayer cells are assembled in a monolithic construction so as<br>
to render completed stacked cell 10, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In operation, as the cell thermally expands or contracts through temperature changes<br>
due to the operation of the cell and due to external influences on the cell, the via fill material<br>
likewise expands or contracts at a rate which is substantially identical to the respective anode<br>
or cathode (or anode contact or cathode contact). Thus, throughout the expansion or<br>
contraction the fill material and the anode/cathode/contacts can expand or contract at a<br>
similar rate. This serves to maintain the integrity of the cell, and prevents distortion which<br>
lessens the efficiency of the cell. In addition, the use of both the desired via fill material and<br>
the desired gas separator plate material allows the cell to advantageously utilize the benefits<br>
of each of the materials.<br>
The foregoing description and drawings merely explain and illustrate the invention<br>
and the invention is not limited thereto except insofar as the appended claims are so limited,<br>
as those skilled in the art who have the disclosure before them will be able to make<br>
