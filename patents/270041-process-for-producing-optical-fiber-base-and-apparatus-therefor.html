				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OPTICAL FIBER BASE AND APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing an optical fiber base material being capable of constantly manufacturing an optical fiber base material of high quality by so-called VAD, and an apparatus of the same. The present patent application claims priority based on a Japanese Patent Application No.2006-175712 filed on June 26, 2006 and a Japanese Patent Application No.2007-164422 filed on June 21, 2007 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]   VAD is well-known as a method of manufacturing base materials for optical fibers.<br>
This method employs the following apparatus, for example.<br>
[0003]   In this apparatus, glass particles produced with a core deposition burner and a<br>
cladding deposition burner disposed in a reaction chamber; and the glass particles are<br>
deposited onto a tip of a starter mounted on a shaft which rotatably lifts up, so that a porous<br>
glass base material for optical fiber composed of a core layer and a cladding layer is<br>
manufactured.   The core layer may be SiO2 with which GeO2 is doped, and the cladding<br>
layer may be substantially pure SiO2.<br>
[0004]   The porous glass base material 1 manufactured as described above is dehydrated<br>
and sintered in a heating furnace. The heating furnace has a furnace tube 2 which can be<br>
sealed, an electric furnace 3 which heats a part of or the whole of the furnace tube 2, a gas<br>
introducing port 4 which introduces any gas into the furnace tube and a gas discharging port<br>
5 which discharges the exhaust gas as shown in Fig.l, for example.    Fig.lA to 1C<br>
progressively show vitrifying the porous glass base material.   Here, reference numeral 6<br>
indicates a shaft which supports the porous glass base material 1.<br>
[0005]   Dehydrating is performed by heating the base material at approximately 1,100<br>
degrees Celsius in dehydrating gas composed of such as chlorine, oxygen and helium.<br>
Meanwhile, vitrifying is performed by heating the base material at approximately 1,500<br>
degrees Celsius in an atmosphere containing such as helium.<br>
[0006]   For the furnace tube forming a part of the heating furnace, conventionally a silica<br>
tube made of natural quartz has been employed as described in Patent document 1.   For<br>
example, the silica tube may be a glass tube such as HERALUX-E (trade name), available<br>
from Shin-Etsu Quartz Products Co., Ltd., which is made by pulverizing natural quartz and<br>
melting by an electric furnace (herein after referred to as a furnace tube of natural quartz).<br>
[0007]   The optical fiber base material manufactured as above may be formed as a<br>
complete optical fiber base material by adding a cladding to the periphery thereof.<br>
[0008]   An  optical   fiber  is   obtained  by  drawing  the  optical   fiber  base  material<br>
manufactured as above, and is provided for optical signal transmission.   For example, light<br>
having a wavelength of 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm is modulated and transmitted through a<br>
single-mode fiber.<br>
Patent document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No.2004-002109<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] Usually, the transmission loss of the optical fiber at the wavelength of 1,310 nm is about 0.32 to 0.34 dB/km, however, it could infrequently become higher than usual, such as about 0.34 to 0.36 dB/km. In most cases, the transmission loss of the optical fiber at the wavelength of 1,550 nm is not very higher than a normal value. Moreover, when transmission losses for a wide wavelength range, such as 900 nm to 1,600 nm are examined, the shorter the wavelength is, the larger the transmission loss is. Conventionally, such transmission loss has been acceptable, however, the market strictly requests for an optical characteristic in recent years, therefore, such transmission loss has come under a problem. [0010] An object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing an optical fiber base material being capable of reducing an occurrence of the situation described above that the transmission loss for a short wavelength region, particularly equal to or less than 1,310 nm, is larger, and an apparatus of the same. This object can be achieved by combinations of features recited in dependent claims. In addition, independent claims define further advantageous specific examples.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0011]   The present invention is provided to solve the above described problem.   That is,<br>
the method of manufacturing an optical fiber base material includes: forming a porous glass<br>
base material by depositing glass particles; providing a synthetic quartz glass vessel that is<br>
formed by melting a soot deposit, the soot deposit being formed by depositing glass<br>
particles which are produced by hydrolyzing silicide with oxyhydrogen flame; introducing<br>
dehydration reaction gas and inert gas into the vessel; heating the vessel that contains the<br>
dehydration reaction gas and the inert gas; and inserting the porous glass base material into<br>
the heated vessel to dehydrate and sinter the porous glass base material.<br>
[0012] Here, the silicide is any of SiCl4, (CH3)SiCl3, (CH3)2, or a mixed compound thereof.<br>
In the heating, at least a portion larger than an area heated by a heat source is made of the<br>
synthetic quartz glass, and heated.<br>
[0013]   In addition, in the dehydrating and sintering, it is preferable that the total amount of<br>
time over which the synthetic quartz glass vessel is subjected to a temperature exceeding<br>
1400 degrees Celsius is within a time over which a glass layer is entirely crystallized in the<br>
depthwise direction in at least a part of synthetic quartz glass tube of the vessel.<br>
Alternatively, it is preferable that the total amount of time is within a time period obtained<br>
by multiplying the thickness (nm) of the synthetic quartz glass by 1,500 hours.<br>
[0014]   An apparatus for manufacturing an optical fiber base material according to the<br>
present invention dehydrates and sinters a porous glass base material for an optical fiber.<br>
A furnace tube forming a part of the apparatus is a synthetic quartz glass vessel which is<br>
formed by melting a soot deposit, the soot deposit is formed by depositing glass particles, the glass particles are produced by hydrolyzing silicide with oxyhydrogen flame. Here, it is preferable that at least a portion larger than a region which is heated by a heat source is made of synthetic quartz glass.<br>
[0015] The summary clause does not necessarily describe all necessary features of the embodiments of the present invention. The present invention may also be a sub-combination of the features described above.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] According to the present invention, since a synthetic quartz glass vessel is used as a furnace tube, impurities from a furnace tube material are not discharged into the furnace tube, so that an optical fiber base material having an excellent optical characteristic can be constantly manufactured. Moreover, by drawing the optical fiber base material, an optical fiber having a low transmission loss can be obtained.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0017]   Fig.lA to 1C are schematic views progressively explaining a step of vitrifying a<br>
porous glass base material.<br>
Fig.2 shows a distribution of transmission losses for optical fibers at a wavelength of 1,310 nm, which are obtained by using a furnace tube of synthetic quartz and a furnace tube of natural quartz.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] Some aspects of the invention will now be described based on the embodiments, which do not intend to limit the scope of the present invention, but exemplify the invention. All of the features and the combinations thereof described in the embodiment are not necessarily essential to the invention.<br>
[0019] As the result of repeated reviews in order to solve the above described problem, it has been considered that increase of the transmission loss is caused by contaminating the optical fiber base material with impurities such a very small amount of Fe which are contained in the conventional natural quartz forming a furnace tube. In addition, it has been considered that increase of the transmission loss is caused by contaminating the optical fiber base material in the furnace tube with a metal forming a furnace or a metal contained in carbon which diffuses and transmits through the tube wall due to corrosion. [0020] More specifically, it is considered that increase of the transmission loss is caused by the following mechanism. That is, the natural quartz furnace tube is progressively crystallized (into cristobalite) while it is used at a high temperature such as approximately 1,400 degrees Celsius. The crystallization starts with impurities and crystallite as a core, which are contained in the natural quartz. After several hundred hours, most of the heated region is crystallized. It is considered that a small amount of impurities such as Fe contained in the natural quartz separate out and diffuse in a crystal grain boundary during<br>
the crystallization.   The diffusion rate of the impurities in the crystal grain boundary is<br>
very faster than a rate at which the impurities diffuse in amorphous glass.<br>
[0021]   Therefore, in comparison with a state before crystallization, impurities such as Fe<br>
are easily discharged from the crystallized natural quartz furnace tube into the interior<br>
thereof.   A part of the impurities which were discharged into the furnace tube is taken into<br>
the optical fiber base material and causes fluctuation of the density of glass, so that<br>
Rayleigh scattering increases.   It is known that optical loss due to Rayleigh scattering is in<br>
proportion to 1/, where  indicates a wavelength of light.   Thus, the phenomenon that the<br>
shorter the wavelength is, the larger the loss is, can be explained by the above described<br>
mechanism.<br>
[0022]   Therefore, a furnace tube is produced by using vitrified synthetic quartz, which is<br>
obtained by hydrolyzing silicide such as SiCl4, (CH3)SiCl3, (CH3)2SiCl2 with oxyhydrogen<br>
flame to form a soot deposit, and melting the soot deposit in a heating furnace.<br>
[0023]   When Fe is taken as an example, the concentration of the impurities contained in<br>
the synthetic quartz tube which is produced by using such high-purity material is equal to or<br>
less than 0.01 ppm.    Meanwhile, it is difficult for the conventional natural quartz to<br>
completely eliminate impurities in the material, and the natural quartz contains Fe of<br>
approximately O.lppm as impurities.     An example of analysis of metal impurities<br>
contained in the raw material is shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Tablel:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0024] The synthetic quartz made of a high-purity silicide as the raw material contains little impurity and crystallite. Accordingly, even if the synthetic quart is used under a high temperature, the crystallization very slowly progresses in comparison with the natural quartz. Accordingly, the synthetic quartz contains little impurity, and a path through which impurities diffuse is not formed therein over the long term. Therefore, when the synthetic quartz having such feature is used as a furnace tube, it is considered that discharge of impurities into the furnace tube scarcely occur. Therefore, an optical fiber base material which is manufactured by using the furnace tube of synthetic quartz according to the mechanism described above can significantly reduce a risk of increasing the transmission loss in comparison with the conventional one.<br>
[0025] Under a use environment intended for the present invention, crystallization of the synthetic quartz progresses by about 1 mm for 1,500 hours. Therefore, in a period obtained by multiplying the thickness of the synthetic quartz by 1,500 hours, a state in which the glass layer remains is maintained even if the synthetic quartz are used at a temperature equal to or more than 1,400 degrees Celsius, so that a risk of contaminating the<br>
optical fiber base material can be reduced.<br>
[0026] Here, at least a part of the furnace tube must be made of the synthetic quartz. Specifically, the part which is heated at a high temperature by a heat source such as an electric furnace must be made of the synthetic quartz. Even if the other part is made of the natural quartz, the effect of the invention is not hurt.<br>
[0027] In addition, it is not directly related to the object of the present invention, however, the synthetic quartz used in the embodiment contains little hydroxy group equal to or less than 1 ppm. Therefore, in view of the description of Patent document 1 that moisture contained in the furnace tube adversely affects the loss characteristic of the optical fiber around the wavelength of 1,380 nm, the synthetic quartz of the embodiment can be used for manufacturing the optical fiber containing little hydroxy group of which demand has rapidly grown in recent years without any problem although the furnace tube is manufactured by a method different from that of Patent document 1. The step of eliminating adsorption moisture described as Patent document 1 is applicable to the synthetic quartz furnace tube which is used in the present invention as well.<br>
[0028] Embodiment 1 For the sake of comparison, the porous glass base material which is deposited by VAD is separated into a first furnace tube of synthetic quartz and a second furnace tube of natural quartz, each of which thickness of the wall is 4mm. Then, each furnace tube is dehydrated and sintered. Further, a cladding is added to each dehydrated and sintered base material, and the base material with the cladding is vitrified, so that an optical fiber base material is obtained. The obtained optical fiber base materials are drawn respectively to measure the transmission loss at the wavelength of 1,310 nm, and then, a distribution of losses are compared. The measured optical fibers are obtained by drawing the optical fiber base materials which are manufactured around the same time, of which 177 fibers are manufactured with the furnace tube of synthetic quartz and of which 1,059 fibers are manufactured with the furnace tube of natural quartz.<br>
[0029] As shown in Fig.2, among the optical fibers made by the furnace tube of natural quartz, 4% of those have the transmission loss more than 0.34 dB/k. Meanwhile, no optical fiber made by the furnace tube of synthetic quartz have the transmission loss more than 0.34 dB/k.<br>
[0030] Here, the furnace tube of synthetic quartz is taken out upon exceeding 6,000 hours over which the furnace tube of synthetic quartz is subjected to a high temperature more than 1,400 degrees Celsius, and the heated portion is examined. The result is that the glass layer is totally eliminated and entirely crystallized in a large part.<br>
[0031] The manufacturing method and the manufacturing apparatus according to the present invention may be provided in another embodiment. That is, in a manufacturing method and a manufacturing apparatus for an optical fiber base material, a vessel which accommodates a porous glass base material is made of synthetic quartz glass, which contains metal impurities less than those in the natural quartz glass. It is preferable that the content of the metal impurities of the synthetic quartz glass is equal to or less than one-tenth of those of the natural quartz glass.<br>
[0032] While the embodiments of the present invention have been described, the technical scope of the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments. It is apparent to persons skilled in the art that various alternations and improvements can be added to the above-described embodiments. It is also apparent from the scope of the claims that the embodiments added with such alternations or improvements can be included in the technical scope of the invention.<br>
