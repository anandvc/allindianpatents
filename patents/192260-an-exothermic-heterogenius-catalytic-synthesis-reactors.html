Title: "Catalyst-seal support device, in particular for exothermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactors"<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst-seal support device, in particular for exothermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactors of the type comprising:<br>
-	a substantially cylindrical external shell,<br>
-	at least one catalytic bed arranged in said shell and<br>
comprising a bottom plate for containment of the catalyst,<br>
-	at least one supporting shoulder for said bottom plate<br>
extending from said shell.<br>
As iS known, when exothermic heterogeneous catalytic reactions are carried out within a synthesis reactor, the external shell and bottom plate of the catalytic beds arranged in the shell being subjected to a temperature increase undergo dimensional changes due to the thermal expansion of the materials which make them up. These dimensional changes can cause undesired phenomena at the connection zone between the shell and the bottom plate, such as for example outlet of the catalyst contained in the bed or damage to the bottom plate structure.<br>
In  the  field  of  exothermic  heterogeneous  catalytic<br>
synthesis reactors there is an ever growing requirement<br>
for providing a device capable of ensuring between the<br>
external shell and the bottom plate of the catalytic beds<br>
an effective catalyst seal, constant and long lasting so       ;<br>
as to avoid the drawbacks mentioned above.  -	i<br><br>
Prior Art<br>
In order to meet the above mentioned requirement, connection devices are provided between the external shell and the bottom plate of the catalytic beds, which comprise a compressible material, e.g. ceramic cords or braids, appropriately arranged in a space defined between the bottom plate and the shell, have become ever more widely used.<br>
If in a reactor for heterogeneous synthesis of ammonia or methanol, the expansion coefficient of the material of the external shell, e.g. of law alloy steel, is different from that of the material of the bottom plate, e.g. of stainless steel, the high operating temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the reaction cause a dimensional variation of the shell on true order of 5 mm to 25 mm, which is much less than that of the bottom plate which is generally from 10 mm to 40 mr..<br>
Consequently, the space between the bottom plate and the shell will be calculated as the time of installation sufficiently ample to allow for the different expansion rates of the materials.<br>
The use of compressible material in the air space permits making a seal between the bottom plate and the shell capable of at least partially absorbing the thermal expansion of the materials.<br>
In the terminology of the field this type of seal is generally termed stuffing box or packing box seal.<br>
Although substantially meeting the purpose the above mentioned device exhibits a series of drawbacks as set forth below.<br>
A first shortcoming is the fact that the device in<br><br>
accordance with the prior art is capable or aosoxwiny only partially the dimensional variations caused by heat expansion of the materials. The compressible material arranged between the bottom plate and the external shell possesses indeed limited compressibility characteristics which make the stuffing or packing box seal effective only in situations of low differential expansion of the mciterials, such as for example if the different heat expansion between the bottom plate and the shell does not exceed 1 mm to 2 mm.<br>
Consequently, in an ammonia or methanol synthesis reactor where, as seen above, there is a differential expansion of the materials of even 15 mm, the use of the above described device is unsatisfactory because during the various cooling/heating cycles which characterize the life of a reactor of this type, the compressible material is crushed irreversibly and thus does not ensure any longer the necessary compensation for the different heat expansions of these materials, with the risk of a leak of the catalyst contained in the bed.<br>
A second drawback is connected with the first and lies in the fact that the compressible material tends to deteriorate rapidly in time because of the unavoidable passage of the gas through it which erodes it.<br>
Consequently, even after a brief period of operation of the synthesis reactor it is no longer possible to ensure optimal and reliable catalyst seal by the connection device.<br>
A third drawback of the connection device in accordance with the prior art is that if the space created between the shell and the bottom plate of the catalytic bed is less than the difference in expansion of the materials there is the possibility of damage to the bottom plate<br><br>
which is pressed against the shell wall.<br>
Lastly, the installation of the device according to the prior art in existing synthesis reactors is problematic from the constructional and the assembly viewpoint, making practical implementation difficult and especially of not negligible cost.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The technical problem underlying the present invention is to make available a catalyst-seal support device, in particular for exothermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactors, which would allow achievement of a reliable and durable catalyst seal between the shell wall and the bottom plate of the catalytic bed, and which at the same time would be simple to manufacture and easy to install in existing synthesis reactors.<br>
The technical problem is solved according to the present invention by a device of the type set forth above characterized in that it comprises an annular element placed tetween said shoulder and said bottom plate, with said annular element associated in a removable manner with said bottom plate and having a thermal expansion coefficient substantially equal to the thermal expansion coefficient of the shell.<br>
According to the present invention it was found that thanks to the presence of an annular element with a thermal expansion coefficient substantially equal to that of the external shell and placed between the shoulder and the bottom plate, it is possible to ensure an optimal and durcJble catalyst seal between the shell wall and the bottom plate of the catalytic bed.<br>
In  fact,  upon  each  increase  or  decrease  of  the<br><br>
temperature inside the synthesis reactor the annular element is deformed analogously to the external shell, while pulling during deformation the overlying bottom plate associated therewith.<br>
In this manner, the distance between the bottom plate and the shell can be held constant to ensure optimal and long-lasting catalyst seal at the same time.<br>
The device according to the present invention can then be effectively employed either when the expansion coefficients of the shell emd the bottom plate are equal or when the expansion coefficient of the shell is less or more than that of the bottom plate, avoiding possible structural damage to the bottom plate and respectively preventing leakage of catalyst from the catalytic beds through the space which would be created between the bottom plate and the shell.<br>
The annular element comprises advantageously a plurality of structurally independent arched portions.<br>
The bottom plate is in turn advantageously made up of a plurality of plate-shaped elements, such as e.g. in the shape of side-by-side circular sectors having a degree of freedom, i.e. with at least one floating end, free of constraint.<br>
Each element of the bottom plate comprises generally a net for retention of the catalyst supported by a grid associated in a removable manner with the annular element.<br>
If the diameter of the external shell of the synthesis reactor is greater than approximately 1000 mm it is preferable to support the grid with appropriate supporting beams.<br><br>
Thanks to the particular thermal expansion coefficient of the annular element the device can be advantageously used to compensate for even large dimensional variations in equipment such as e.g. methanol synthesis reactors operating at high temperatures and subject to differentials expansions notoriously on the order of 5 mm to 15 mm.<br>
In addition, the device in accordance with the present invention does not exhibit the problems of deterioration mentioned above with reference to the prior art and can thus be employed in any type of operational situation while ensuring long service life.<br>
Another advantage of the device which is the subject matter of the present invention lies in its simplicity of implementation which permits installation thereof in existing synthesis reactors.<br>
Indeed, an annular element provided by a plurality of structurally independent arched portions, has the dual advantage of being easy to install in the reactor and adapting readily and well to the internal wall of the shell which in a synthesis reactor is usually irregular.<br>
In this last case, the presence of the annular element permits advantageously keeping the bottom plate constantly near the irregular wall of the shell to ensure the best catalyst seal.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an exotnermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactor comprising; a substantiali&gt;' cyhndrical external shell at least one catalytic bed arranged in said shell and comprising a bottom plate for catalyst containment; at least one supporting shoulder for said bottom plate extending from said shell characterized in that it comprises a catalyst-seal support device comprising an annular element placed between said shoulder and said bottom plate with said annular element associated in a removable manner with said bottom plate and having a thennal expansion coefficient substantially equal to that of the shell .<br>

Detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
In figure 1, reference number 1 indicates as a whole a exothermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactor, in particular for methanol  synthesis.<br>
The reactor 1 comprises a tiibular external shell 2 having at the top an opening 3 for input of reagent gasses, and at the bottom an opening 4 for output of the reaction products.<br>
Reference numbers 5a-5d indicated respectively.catalytic beds   arranged   in mutually  spaced  relationship  inside  the<br><br>
shell 2. Between these, the beds 5a-5c are limited relow by respective gas-permeable bottom plates 6a-6c adjrcent to the shell 2.<br>
The bottom plates 6a-6c are supported by means of the annular shoulders 7a-7c extending from the shell 2 ir co¬operation with the annular shoulders 8a-8c formed :n a tubular beam 9 extending coaxially with the reactor :.<br>
Between the bottom plate 6a-6c and the shoulders *i-7c and 8a-8c are provided opposed supporting elements i: 11 of variable height, which support at predetemmed distances the bottom plates 6a-6c. Preferably eac: of these supporting elements 10, 11 comprises a tui-lar skirt or alternatively a plurality of substant. illy rod-shaped struts.<br>
Between two adjacent catalytic beds 5a-5d is ilso provided a gaseous flow mixing unit of conventional "Tpe and comprising a baffle 12 and an annular opening II =nd a perforated distributor 14 for a cooling gas streair ■<br>
The catalytic bed 5d has a gas-permeeible side wal. 15 permitting the reaction products emerging from the b^.: 5d to reach the opening 4.<br>
With reference to figures 1 to 3 reference number 16 indicates as a whole a catalyst-seal support devicr in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The catalyst-seal support device 16 comprises an ar-riilar element 17 placed between the annular shoulder 7a-7c and the bottom plate 6a-6c with which it is associated „-: a removable manner.<br>
Specifically, the annular element 17 is rested or. the supporting element 10 and is associated in ffremor^ble manner with the gas-permeable bottom plate, for exanple<br><br>
the wall 6a of the bed 5a, by means of suitable pins 18 inserted in respective rings 19 fixed to the annular element 17.<br>
As an alternative to the rings 19 there can be provided S  housing seats (not shown) made in the surface of the annular element in contact with the bottom plate and designed to house respective pins 18.<br>
Advantageously, the annular element 17 possesses a thermal expansion coefficient substantially equal to the thermal expansion coefficient of the shell 2 so as to be able to change size in a manner similar to that of the shell when the reactor is subjected to sudden changes of temperature.<br>
The bottom plate 6a-6c is freely floating on one side on the support 11 and on the opposite side is associated in a removable manner with the annular element 17 and thus follows the dimensional changes of the latter while remaining constantly near or in contact with the shell 2 to provide therewith a reliable and long-lasting catalyst seal.<br>
In this manner it is possible to avoid occurrence, during operation of the synthesis reactor 1, of undesired phenomena such as for example leaking of the catalyst from the catalytic beds 5a-5d or the risk of structural damage to the bottom plate 6a-6c, typical of devices in accordance with the prior art with stuffing box seal.<br>
Preferably, the annular element consists of the same material as the shell 2 which in the case of an exothermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactor such as that for methanol can be a low-alloy steel, e.g. 1.25 Cr - 0.5 Mo.<br><br>
The bottom plate 6a and the bottom plates 6b and 6c, comprise advantageously a net 20 for retention of the catalyst and a supporting grid 21 beneath the net 20.<br>
The supporting elements 10 and 11 rest on the respective annular shoulders 7a-7c and 8a-8c and have the purpose of spacing the catalytic beds 5a-5c in the desired manner so as to better utilize the useful volume of the synthesis reactor. Their use is thus quite optional.<br>
As an alternative, the supporting element 10 can be replaced by the annular element 17 which in this case will have the dual function of providing a catalyst seal between bottom plate and shell wall, and spacing the catalytic beds 5a-5c. According to this particular embodiment which is shown in figure 6, the bottom plate 6a-6c is fixed in a removable manner to the annular element 17 by means of a plurality of pins extending from the bottom plate and housed in a space defined between the annular element 17 and the shell 2.<br>
In figure 3 it is possible to observe how the annular element 17 is preferably made up of a plurality of arched , portions 22 which are four in this specific case and structurally independent and fixed together e.g. by means of conventional bolts not shown.<br>
The bottom plate 6a just as the bottom plates 6b and 6c are in turn made up of a plurality of circular sectors 23 arranged side-by-side. For the sake of clarity fig\ire 3 shows only two circular sectors 23.<br>
The end of the circular sectors 23 opposite the annular element 17 is rested in an overhanging manner on the support element 11. In this manner the circular sectors 23 aje free to follow the dimensiorial changes of the annular element 17 with which they are associated in a<br><br>
removable manner.<br>
In an alternative embodiment not shown there is also provided a plurality of radial supporting beams placed between the annular element 17 and the respective circular sectors 23.<br>
Figure 4 shows as a whole an exothermic heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactor, in particular for methanol synthesis, incorporating a catalyst-seal support device in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In this figure the details of the reactor 1 structurally and functionally equivalent to those shown in figures 1-3 are indicated by the same reference signs and not further described.<br>
The catalytic bed 5d has a gas-permeable bottom plate 24 permitting the reaction products emerging from the ted 5d to reach the opening 4.<br>
With reference to figures 4 to 6 the catalyst-seal support device provided in accordance with the present invention and indicated as a whole by 16, comprises an annular element 25 placed between the annular shoulder 7a-7c and the bottom plate 6a-6c with which it is associated in a removable manner.<br>
The bottom plates 6a-6c are supported in a mutually spaced relationship in the shell 2 by means of respective annular elements 25 rested on the annular shoulders 7a-7c, in co-operation with a plurality of supporting T beams 26.<br>
In this particular embodiment of the present invention, the annular element 25 fulfils, in addition to the function of catalyst seal between the TSottom plate and the shell wall, the function of spacing the catalytic<br><br>
beds 5a-5c since it is made in the form of a tubular skirt. As an alternative, there can be provided supporting elements 10 of the conventional type placed between the annular element, appropriately modified, and the shoulders, as illustrated in figure 1.<br>
Figure 5 shows how the bottom plate 6a, similarly to the bottom plates 6b-6c, comprises a plurality of central plate-shaped elements 27 and peripheral plate-shaped elements 28. The supporting beams 26 are distinguished in turn between the main primary beams 29 and the secondary beams 30.<br>
The central plate-shaped elements 27 are supported longitudinally by the primary beams 29 and transversely by the secondary beams 30.<br>
The secondary plate-shaped elements 28 are supported, in addition to the beams 29 and 30, also by the annular element 25 with which they are associated in a removable manner as shown in figure 6.<br>
Between the annular element 25	and the shell 2  is<br>
advantageously defined a space 31	in which are housed a<br>
plurality of pins 32 extending	from the peripheral<br>
plate-shaped elements 28.<br>
The end of the plate-shaped peripheral sectors 28 opposite the annular element 25 is rested in an overhanging manner on the wings 33, 34 of the main beams 29 and secondary beams 30, respectively. In this manner the plate-shaped sectors 23 are free to follow the dimensional changes of the annular element 25 with which they are associated in a removeible manner to thus ensure a reliable and long-lasting catalyst seal.<br>
The annular element 25 can be provided enbloc or can<br><br>
comprise a plurality of structurally independent arched portions as shown in the example of figure 3.<br>

The above discussion clarifies the numerous advantages achieved by the catalyst-seal support device according to the present invention. In particular there is achieved between the external shell and the bottom plate of the catalytic beds an effective constant and long-lasting catalyst seal which ensures the synthesis reactor a reliability not previously achievable with the connecting devices in accordance with the prior art.<br><br>
