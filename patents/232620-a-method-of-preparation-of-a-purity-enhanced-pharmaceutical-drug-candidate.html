Background of The Invention<br>
The compound, 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid, disodium salt, is a compound known<br>
in the literature since the 1930's {e.g., see G.C.H.Stone, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 58, 488<br>
(1936)). The synthesis of 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid disodium salt was based on the<br>
reaction of 1,3-dibromopropane with sodium sulfite in aqueous media, as indicated in<br>
the following scheme:<br>
2Na2S03<br>
Br^^^^^Br   	^   NaOsS^^-^^SOaNa + 2NaBi<br>
However, a number of significant problems exist with the known synthetic strategy that make this method of preparation of 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid disodium salt non-optimal, e.g., non-efficient, for large scale preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. For example, the original synthesis (by Stone) involved a work-up procedure using salts of lead, barium, and silver to remove inorganic materials followed by repeated precipitation, resulting in a very low yield.<br>
hi particular, the potential for the production of by-products that would be considered toxic to animals, e.g., humans, such as alkylating agents, exists. In addition to the starting materials and the reaction product, there are several related possible organic by-products, as well as other inorganic compounds (sulfate and sulfite). The following scheme outlines all the possible compounds in the reaction mixture.<br><br><br>
An additional problem with the existing methodology involves the large amount of ethanol required for purification of the product.   The reaction produces two-mole-equivalent of NaBr for one mole of 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid disodiuni salt, creating an unfavorable product mass balance, /. e., creating significant waste. In order to remove the large amount of sodium bromide, ethanol is employed to precipitate the product, leaving the sodium bromide in the supernatant.<br>
There are two direct effects of using a large volume of ethanol. The first is the cost of the solvent, and the second is the throughput reduction (limited by the reaction vessel capacity) that in turn increases the cost of the entire process. Furthermore, due to tlie large volume of ethanol used in the purification, the batch size is relatively small. As a result the throughput of production is reduced, and consequently the actual cost of the fmal product increases.<br>
Additionally, the known synthesis of 3-amino-l-propanesuIfonic acid is based on the reaction of 3-chloro-l-propyiamine{3-CPA) hydrochloride with sodium sulfite in aqueous solution.<br><br>
This reaction produces two-mole-equivalents of NaCI for one mole of the product, creating an unfavorable product mass balance, i.e., creating significant waste. Moreover, in the manufacturing process, concentrated HCl is required to precipitate the sodium chloride, followed by ethanol precipitation of the product from aqueous solution.<br><br>
Again, the potential for the production of by-products that would be considered toxic to animals, e.g., humans, such as alkylating agents, exists. For example, the starting material, 3-CPA, may persist in the target product; even at a low level, this could cause concern in the administration of the compound in a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Application to Amyloidosis<br>
Compounds such as S-amino-l-propanesulfonic acid and 1,3-pcopanedisuIfonic acid disodium salt have recently been discovered to be usefiil for the treatment of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis refers to a pathological condition characterized by the presence of amyloid fibrils. Amyloid is a generic term referring to a group of diverse but specific protein deposits (intracellular or extracellular) which are seen in a number of different diseases. Though diverse in their occmrence, all amyloid deposits have common morphologic properties, stain with specific dyes (e.g., Congo red), and have a characteristic red-green birefringent appearance in polarized light after staining. They also share common ultrastructural features and common X-ray diffraction and infrared spectra.<br>
Amyloid-related diseases can either be restricted to one organ or spread to several organs. The first instance is referred to as "localized amyloidosis" while the second is referred to as "systemic amyloidosis."<br>
Some amyloid diseases can be idiopathic, but most of these diseases appear as a complication of a previously existing disorder. For example, primary amyloidosis (AL amyloid) can appear without any other pathology or can follow plasma cell dyscrasia or multiple myeloma.<br>
Secondary amyloidosis is usually seen associated with chronic infection (such as tuberculosis) or chronic inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis). A familial form of secondary amyloidosis is also seen in other types of familial amyloidosis, e.g.. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). This familial type of ainyloidosis is genetically inherited and is found in specific population groups. In both primary and secondary amyloidosis, deposits ai"e found in several organs and are thus considered systemic amyloid diseases.<br>
"Localized amyloidoses" are those that tend to involve a single organ system. Different amyloids are also characterized by the type of protein present in the deposit. For example, neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the like are characterized by the appearance and accumulation of a protease-resistant form of a prion protein (referred to as AScr or PrP-27) in the central nervous system. Similarly, Alzheimer's disease, another neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary<br><br>
tangles, hi this case, the amyloid plaques found in the parenchyma and the blood vessel is formed by the deposition of fibrillar Ap amyloid protein. Other diseases such as adult-onset diabetes (type H diabetes) are characterized by the localized accumulation of amyloid fibrils in the pancreas.<br>
Once these amyloids have fonned, there is no known, widely accepted ther^y or treatment which significantly dissolves amyloid deposits in situ, prevents fiirther amyloid deposition or prevents the initiation of amyloid deposition.<br>
Each amyloidogenic protein has the ability to undergo a conformational change and to organize into p-sheets and form insoluble fibrils which may be deposited extracellularly or intracellularly. Each amyloidogenic protein, although different in amino acidsequence, has the same property of forming fibrils and binding to other elements such as proteoglycan, amyloid P and complement component. Moreover, each amyloidogenic protein has amino acid sequences which, although different, show similarities such as regions with the ability to bind to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) portion of proteoglycan (referred to as the GAG binding site) as well as other regions which promote p-sheet fomiation. Proteoglycans are raacromolecules of various sizes and structures that are districuted almost everywhere in the body. They can be found in the jntracellulai" compartment, on the surface of cells, and as part of the extracellular matrix. The basic structure of all proteoglycans is comprised of a core protein and at least one, but fiequently more, polysaccharide chains (GAGs) attached to the core protein. Many different GAGs have been discovered including chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin, and hyaluronan.<br>
In specific cases, amyloid fibrils, once deposited, can become toxic to the surrounding cells. For example, the Ap fibrils organized as senile plaques have been shown to be associated with dead nem-onal cells, dystrophic neurites, astrocytosis, and micioghosis in patients with Aizheimer's disease. When tested m vitro, oligomeric (soluble) as well as fibrillar Ap peptide was shown to be capable of triggering an activation process of microgha (brain macrophages), which would explain the presence af microgljosis and brain inflammation found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Both oligomeric and fibrillar AP peptide can also induce neuronal cell death in ^itro. See, e.g., MP Lambert, et a!., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 6448-53 (1998).<br>
In another type of amyloidosis seen in patients with type H diabetes, the imyloidogenic protein lAPP, when organized in oligomeric forms or in fibrils, has been ;hown to induce p-islet cell toxicity in vitro. Hence, appearance of lAPP fibrils in the tancreas of type II diabetic patients contributes to the loss of tlie P islet cells Langerhans) and organ dysfunction which can lead to insulinemia.<br><br>
Another type of amyloidosis is related to p2 microglobulin and is found in long-term hemodialysis patients. Patients undergoing long term hemodialysis will develop Pi-microglobulin fibrils in the carpal tunnel and in the collagen rich tissues in several joints. This causes severe pains, joint stifSiess and swelling.<br>
Amyloidosis is also characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease of the brain that results in progressive memory loss leading to dementia, physical disability, and death over a relatively long period of time. With the aging populations in developed countries, the number of Alzheimer's patients is reaching epidemic proportions.<br>
People suffering fi:om Alzheimer's disease develop a progressive dementia in adulthood, accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffiise loss of neurons in multiple parts of the brain; accumulation of intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles; and accumulation of extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by misshapen nerve terminals (dystrophic neurites) and activated microglia (microgliosis and astrocytosis). A main constituent of these amyloid plaques is the amyloid-p peptide (Ap), a 39-43 amino-acid protein that is produced through cleavage of the p-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Extensive research has been conducted on the relevance of Ap deposits in Alzheimer's disease, see. e.g., Selkoe, Trends in CellBiolog)' 8, 447-453 (1998). Ap naturally arises fi-om the metabolic processing of the amyloid precursor protein ("APP") in the endoplasmic reticulum ("ER"), the Golgi apparatus, or the endosomaMysosomal pathway, and most is normally secreted as a 40 ("Api-40") or 42 ("Apl-42") amino acid peptide (Selkoe, Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 10, 373-403 (1994)). A role for Ap as a primary cause for Alzheimer's disease is supported by the presence of extracellular Ap deposits in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, the increased production of Ap in cells harboring mutant Alzheimer's disease associated genes, e.g., amyloid precursor protein, presenilin I and presenilin H; and the toxicity of extracellular soluble (oligomeric) or fibrillar Ap to cells in culture. See, e.g., Gervais, Eur. Biopharm. Review, 40-42 (Autumn 2001); May, DDT^, 459-62 (2001). Although symptomatic treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease, this disease cannot be prevented or cured at this time.<br>
Alzlieimer's disease is characterized by diffuse and neuritic plaques, cerebral angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaque and blood vessel amyloid is believed to be formed by the deposition of insoluble Ap amyloid protein, which may be described as diffiise or fibrillary. Both soluble oligomeric AP and fibrillar Ap are also believed to be neurotoxic and inflammatory.<br>
Another type of amyloidosis is cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is the specific deposition of amyloid p fibrils in the walls of leptomingeal and cortical arteries.<br><br>
arterioles and veins. It is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, Dovm's syndrome and normal aging, as well as with a variety of familial conditions related to<br>
strokeordementia(5eeFrangioneeia/., Amyloid: J. Protein Folding Disord. 8, Suppl. 1, 36-42(2001)).<br>
Presently available therapies for treatment of P-amyloid diseases are almost entirely symptomatic, providing only temporary or partial clinical benefit. Although some pharmaceutical agents have been described that offer partial symptomatic relief, no comprehensive pharmacological therapy is currently available for the prevention or treatment of, for example, Alzheimer's disease.<br>

Detailed Description of The InvcnUop<br>
This invention pertains to methods of preparation of sulfonate derivatized compounds, e.g., 3-amino-l-propanesulfonic acid and 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid disodium salt with increased purity, with reduced potential for toxic by-products, and that are pharmaceutically useful, e.g., for the treatment of amyloidosis.<br>
It is envisioned that the methods of preparation of the present invention, i.e., synthetic strategies, are applicable to the preparation of a large number of commercially valuable compounds.<br>
/	Methods of the Invention<br>
Accordingly in one embodiment, the invention is directed to a method of large scale preparation of a sulfonate derivatized compound comprising opening a sultone ring with a nucleophile, such that a sulfonate derivatized compound is produced in large scale.<br><br>
wherein n = I to 5, e.g., 1 or 2; Nu is the nucleophile; M is a hydrogen or a salt-forming jroup; R', R^ K\ R"*, R^ and R^ are independently selected from any substituent that loes not significantly interefere with the ability of the reaction to proceed, e.g., ;ubstituents noted herein, e.g., hydrogen, or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group. 'or example, in certain embodiments, substituents that would not be contemplated by he present application would be those substituents that would be more reactive than the ■olfiir of the sultone ring or those substituents, e.g., certain amines, which would result<br><br>
in polymerization of the starting material. In organic synthesis, sulfonate is often used as a leaving group.<br>
In SN2 reactions, a nucleophile can attack the carbon atom where a sulfonate group is covalently connected through the single-bounded oxygen atom. This reaction results in the displacement of the sulfonate group by the nucleophile. In the case of OL,CB-alkane sultone, where the sulfonate has a cyclic structure having sulfur bounded to Ca and oxygen boimded to Cm, this reaction leads to the formation of a o-substituted-a-alkanesulfonic acid derivative. Typical, commercially available sultones are 1,3-propane sultone and 1,4-butane sultone.<br><br>
wherein n = 1 or 2; Nu is the nucleophile; M is a hydrogen or a salt-forming group, e.g., sodiym.<br>
i	The language "sulfonate derivatized compound" includes any compound that<br>
contains a sulfonate group as a functional moiety that can be prepared by the methods of the present invention.<br>
A "sulfonate group" as nsed herein is an -SO3H or -SO3X group bonded to a carbon atom, where X is a cationic group or an ester forming group. Similarly, a "sulfonic acid" compound has a -SO3H group bonded to a carbon atom. A "sulfate" as used herein is a -OSO3H or -OSO3X group bonded to a carbon atom, where X is a cationic group or an ester group; and a "sulfiiric acid" compound has a -OSO3H group bonded to a carbon atom. According to the invention, a suitable cationic group may be a hydrogen atom or a salt-forming metal ion. In certain cases, the cationic group may actually be another group on the sulfonate derivatized compound that is positively charged at physiological pH, for example an amino gioup. Such compounds containing such 3 cationic group covalently bonded to the sulfonate derivatized compound itself may be referred to as an "inner saU" or a "zwitterion."<br>
In a specific embodiment, when Nu is a sulfite anion, n is equal to 1, R , R , R , R', R^, and R^ are hydrogen, and M is sodium, the above reaction becomes the following;<br><br><br>
and 3-amino-l-propanesi\Ifonic acid is the product.<br>

In specific embodiments, the nucleophile is a sulfite anion.   In another embodiment, phosphorus acid or its equivalent such as its esters may be used as a nucleophile (to produce phosphonoalkanesulfonic acid).<br><br>

The reactions/methodologies are advantageous or beneficial as compared with the existing methodology in several ways.<br>
L	Analysis of Beneficial Reaction Properties<br>
In one embodiment, the methods of preparation of the invention are advantageous over the methods that are currently in use. In certain embodiments, a method of the invention possesses a beneficial reaction property (BRP).<br>
The language "beneficial reaction property or BRP" includes a property of one reaction that is beneficial over an existing maimer of performing the same reaction. The property may be any property suitable to comparison to the existing metliodology, such that the property is equal to or better in nature than the property of the existing methodology. Examples of such properties include, without lunitation, starting material safety, reaction time, energy cost, reaction safety, product mass balance (reduction of waste), reaction cleanliness, waste, throughput, sulfate levels/workup (i.e., with respect to workup of the reaction), overall process time, and the overall cost of the target product. Several particular examples of beneficial reaction properties as applied to the preparation of 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid disodium salt are discussed below.<br><br>
Safety of the Starting Materials<br>
hi the methodology that is currently used to prepare 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid disodium salt, the starting material is 1,3-dibromopropane, which is a toxic iaciymor liquid. As such, storage and use of the starting material in the reactions is made difficult. In contrast, while 1,3-propane sultone is toxic, the advantage of 1,3-propane sultone is that it is a crystalline solid at room temperature. Therefore, storage in a dry environment of this starting material has obvious advantages, e.g., in the situation in which there is a damaged container. Moreover, containment of such a spill is made easier by the ability to rapidly hydrolyze 1,3-propane sultone to the less harmfiil 3-hydroxy-l-propanesulfonic acid.<br>
Energy Cost and Reaction Safety<br>
The 1,3-dibromopropane reaction requires high temperature (90 to 100°C), while in certain embodiments, the 1,3-propane sultone reaction is performed under cooling conditions (10 to 15°C), at least at the beginning, to minimize the hydrolysis of the starting material (side reaction) and to absorb the exotherm. The exothemi is contained by a controlled addition rate of the 1,3-propane sultone, as a solution, to the cold aqueous solution of sodium sulfite. A steady temperature is reached during the course of the addition. Then, the temperature of the mixture is reduced, for example, to the temperature of a circulating cooling system.<br>
hi one embodiment, it is possible to allow the reaction to cool to room temperature after the end of the addition without the assistance of a cooling apparatus, thus reducing the energy costs.<br>
Waste<br>
Theoretically, for the 1,3-dibromopropane route, 45 % of the mass on the product side is waste; as compared to 0% for the 1,3-propane sultone route. Moreover, in the 1,3-dibromopropane route the mass of solid waste is in solution in the filtrate of the precipitations. The filtrate is halogenated waste, and therefore disposal costs are higher.<br>
In regard to the total amount of waste, the 1,3-propane sultone route can reduce waste by about 50 % over the 1,3- dibromopropaneroute, if only two precipitations are used in the 1,3-dibromopropane route. Ifmore precipitations are required for the 1,3-dibromopropane route, the advantage of the 1,3-propane sultone route will be even greater.<br><br>
Product mass balance<br>
The mass balance of product is only 55 % for the 1,3-dibromopropane route; as compared to 100 percent for the 1,3-propane sultone route.<br>
Jinpurities/Cleanliness<br>
The 1,3-propane sultone synthetic route has only one side reaction: the hydrolysis of 1,3-propane sultone by water which produces only one by-product firtm the reaction (3-hydroxy-l-propariesulfomc acid sodium salt, see below).<br>
HO.    ^\    ,S03Na<br>
As this side product is ionic, it is easily detected by ion liquid chromatography. In addition, in the methods of the present application, there is no apparent further oxidation of sulfite into sulfate (which is present as an impurity in the sodium sulfite, regardless of the grade).<br>
In an additional advantage, there is no NaBr or other inorganic salt produced by the reaction. As a result, the cleanup of tlie reaction mixture becomes much easier. In fact, even if ethanol precipitation is utilized for final product purification, the amount of ethanol utilized would be reduced dramatically as compared to that used to remove inorganic salts in the 1,3- dibromopropane route. Decreasing the volume of ethanol will increase the throughput of the production by increasing batch size, and will also reduce production cost. Ehminating the step of removal of NaBr in the purification also reduces the time required for the process.<br>
In contrast, several by-products are theoretically possible and are commonly obtained in the 1,3-dibromopropane route, as described above. Some of these by¬products, like 1,3-propanediol, are non-ionic, resulting in the need for the use of additional analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography. Moreover, in the 1,3-dibromopropane route, there is some oxidation of the sulfite into sulfate during the course of the reaction.<br>
Furthermore, the level of sulfates reached for the 1,3-dibromopropane route may sometimes require additional treatments to lower sulfate below acceptable limits for pharmaceutical compositions. The known methodology for the reduction/removal of sulfates has been the use of barium, (,e., precipitating the sulfate as an insoluble barium salt (in aqueous solutions). There are two concerns about the barium treatment for the removal of sulfate and sulfite: (I) the presence of a residual heavy metal (barium) in the final drug candidate that may cause concern when administered to animal subjects, e.g., humans, and (2) the increase in the labor/steps in the process of preparation.<br><br>
Tlv'oughput<br>
The throughput for the 1,3-dibromopropane route ranges within 33 to 3 S kg per batch for a 2,000-L reactor. The expected throughput for the 1,3-propane sultone route is about 260 kilograms per batch for a 2,000-L reactor {i.e., a 5.8 to 6.8-fold increase as compared with the current 1,3-dibromopropane route).<br>
In certain embodiments the throughput may be defined by the "load capacity," which, in turn, may be calculated by using the following equation:<br><br>
For example, the load capacity of the 260 kilogram sultone batch (described above) in a 2,000-L reactor is 13% as compared with about 1.8% load capacity for the 1,3-dibromopropane route.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is a method of enhanced throughput production of a sulfonate derivatized compound comprising opening a sultone ring with a nucleophile, such that enhanced throughput of a sulfonate derivatized compound occurs.<br>
The language "enhanced throughput production," is a characteristic of a process (independent of scale), e.g., achemicalsynthelicprocessof the invention, which demonstrates improved throughput. Moreover, enhanced throughput is a measurable quantity, which may be measiued both qualitatively, i.e., showing qualitative improvement in throughput, or quantitatively, i.e., showing quantitative or quantifiable improvement in the throughput, and maybe measured/determined, for example, by comparing the load capacity of the processes. In certain embodiments of the invention, the load capacity is greater than the load capacity of the existing methodology. In particular embodiments, the load capacity of the sultone route is greater than or equal to 2%, e.g., greater than or equal to 3%, e.g., greater than or equal to 4%, e.g., greater than or equal to 5%, e.g., greater than or equal to 6%, e.g., greater than or equal to 7%, e.g., greater than or equal to 8%, e.g., greater than or equal to 9%, e.g., greater than or equal to 10%, e.g., greater than or equal to 11%, eg., greater than or equal to 12%, e.g., greater tlian or equal to 13%, and e.g., greater than or equal to 15%<br><br><br>
optimization: the solvent and co-solvent in which to perfonn the reaction; the reaction profile as appHcable to starting material consumption and side product fonnation; temperature profile as applicable to starting material consumption and side product fonnation; the work-up and purification of the reaction mixture; and the water content of the product. The scheme (Scheme 1) listed below, with examples of conditions such as starting material, solvent and temperature, are only intended to be instructive, and are not intended to be limiting.<br><br>
Solvent<br>
In one embodiment, the main solvent useful in the methods of the invention is selected such that the solvent has the ability to solubilize, at least in part, the starting material, e.g., the nucleophile (i.e., when sodium sulfite is the starting material nucleophile, water may be selected as the main solvent). In an alternative embodiment, the main solvent useful in the methods of the invention is selected such that the solvent does not affect, e.g., increase or insignificantly decrease, the nucleophilic character of the desired nucleophile (i.e., the desired atom within complex molecules). For example, in certain embodiments of the invention, when the desired nucleopliile is the sulfur of a sulfite anion, the solvent is selected to be H2O, which increases the nucleophilicity of the sulflu" in the sulfite anion.<br>
The co-solvent may include any solvent that is: at least partially miscible with the main solvent (such that the reaction may proceed); at least partially miscible with the starting material, e.g., the sultone ring; and does not substantially affect the sultone ring opening reaction. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited to methanol, toluene, tefrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone, and 1,4-dioxane. In particular embodiments, the co-solvent is acetone. Acetone is relatively inexpensive, not too toxic, and easy to recover. In embodiments in which acetone is selected as the co-solvent, relatively little degradation, e.g., no degradation, of 1,3-propane sultone by acetone occurs.<br><br>
There are many reasons for the use of a co-solvent to dissolve the sultone, e.g., 1,3-propane sultone: (1) The sultone may be a solid at room temperature. (2) The melted sultone may be viscous and a co-solvent would therefore help to lower the viscosity and facilitates transfer. (3) The sultone may have a limited solubility in water (e.g., fox 1,3-propaiie sultone, the limited solubility was observed, not measured). However, the partition coefficient of 1,3-propane sultone for water/toluene is 1.4. Therefore, even if only a small amount of toluene is used to keep the 1,3-propane sultone liquid, 1,3-propane sultone prefers to associate with the aqueous phase. (4) Dilution of the sultone helps control the exothennic reaction, even if a bath with a thermostat is used (i.e., heat exchangers have limits).<br>
Furthermore, the amount of co-solvent used should be adequate to allow the ring opening reaction to proceed. In one particular embodiment, the amount of co-solvent used is 1 mLof acetone per gram of 1,3-propane sultone. In certain embodiments, the solvents, i.e., the main solvent and the cosolvent, are selected based on the characteristic of substantial non-toxicity.<br>
Moreover, suitable solvents are Hquids at ambient room temperature and pressure or remain in the liquid state under the temperature and pressure conditions used in the reaction. Useful solvents are not particularly restricted provided that they do not interfere with the reaction itself (that is, they preferably are inert solvents), and they dissolve a certain amount of the reactants. Depending on the circumstances, solvents may be distilled or degassed. Solvents may be, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., hexanes, heptanes, Hgroin, petroleum ether, cyclohexane, or methylcyclobexane) and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., methylenechloride, chloroform, carbontetrachloride, dichloroethiine, chlorobenzene, or dichlorobenzene); aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, tehahydronaphthalene, ethylbenzene, or xylene); ethers (e.g., diglyme, methyl-/er/-butyl ether, methyl-/e;V-amyl ether, ethyl-/ert-butyl ether, diethylethcr, diisopropylether, tetrahydrolliran or methyltetrahydrofiirans, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, or diethyleneglycol dimethylether); nitriles {e.g., acetonitrile); ketones (e.g., acetone); esters (e.g., methyl acetate or ethyl acetate); and mixtures thereof<br>
Reaction Profile<br>
In certain embodiments, the reaction is fast upon addition of the first aliquot of nucleophile to the sultone, i.e., as observed by NMR the first half-equivalent is completely consumed as it is added. At the end of the addition with 10% excess, about 5 % of the starting material (seen in the aqueous layer, by NMR) remains unreacted a few<br><br>
minutes after the end of the addition. After this point, the disappearance of the sultone, e.g., 1,3-propane suhone, slows down as the acidity increases.<br>
In one embodiment, the excess sultone, e.g., 1,3-propane sultone, is removed in the reaction work-up. In an alternative embodiment, the excess suhone, e.g., 1,3-propane sultone, is removed by hydrolysis. Furthermore, HPLC analysis can be used to determine how much of an excess of the sultone is required to consume the nucleophile, e.g., sodium sulfite, in order to limit unnecessary purification steps.<br>
Temperature Profile<br>
hi one embodiment, the sulfite anion solution is equilibrated at the temperature of the circulating cooling system, e.g., a water bath equipped with a copper coil. It was observed that the temperature of reaction mixture increases rapidly to a plateau where a steady state is obtained, i.e., the exothenn of the reaction is in equilibrium with the heat removal capacity of the cooling system. In certain embodiments (as shown below), the change in temperature increase was less than 5°C for a 300-g scale reaction.<br>
In certain embodiments, the changes in relative concentration of the starting material at about 1 hour after the addition, occur relatively slowly. HPLC (in real time) can be used to monitor the reaction.   However, a metliod to quench the remaining sulfite (e.g., peroxide) and to destroy the excess sultone, e.g., 1,3-propane sultone, may be necessary because the sultone, e.g., \ ,3-propane sultone, may not degrade in a regular fashion in the mobile phase of the HPLC column depending on the time it is sitting in the HPLC auto-sampler area.<br>
In one example, in which the starting material is 1,3-propane sultone, it has been determined that the lower the temperature, the slower is the hydrolysis of the starting material. In one embodiment, the temperatui-e is increased at the end of the reaction, e.g., to increase the speed of the desired reaction and/or increase the hydrolysis of the excess starting material. In another embodiment, in parallel to the temperature increase, the pH is maintained in a range of 4-6.<br>

V. Pharmaceuiical Compositions<br>
The formulations of the invention may further include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "phaimaceutically acceptable carrier" includes a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or carrier, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or<br><br>
transporting a compound(s) of the present invention within or to the subject such that it can perform its intended function. Typically, such compounds are carried or transported from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceuUcally acceptable carriers include; sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as com starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl ceUulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aliuninum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. As used herein "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" also includes any and all coatings, antibacterial and antifimgal agents, and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are compatible with the activity of the compound, and are physiologically acceptable to the subject.

magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisnlfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal chelating agents, such as citric 3cid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments, active compounds of the invention are administered at a herapeutically effective dosage sufficient to inhibit amyloid deposition or treat or irevent amyloidosis in a subject. A "therapeutically effective dosage" preferably nhibits amyloid deposition by at least about 20%, e.g., by at least about 40%, e,g., by at east about 60%, e.g., or by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects. The ability )f a compound to inhibit amyloid deposition can be evaluated in an animal model system<br><br>
that may be predictive of efficacy in inhibiting amyloid deposition in human diseases. Alternatively, the ability of a compound to inhibit amyloid dqiosition can be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound to inhibit an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a basement membrane constituent, e.g., using a binding assay such as that described hereinbefore.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efScacy of such agents can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell caltures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Agents which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
The term "subject" includes living organisms in which amyloidosis can occur, or which are susceptible to amyloid diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, CAA, dialysis-related (P2M) amyloidosis, secondary (AA) amyloidosis, primary (AL) amyloidosis, hereditary amyloidosis, diabetes, etc. Examples of subjects include humans, monkeys, cows, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats. The language "subject" includes animals {e.g., mammals, e.g., cats, dogs, horses, pigs, cows, goats, sheep, rodents, e.g., mice or rats, rabbits, squirrels, bears, primates (e.g., chimpanzees, monkeys, gorillas, and humans)), as well as chickens, ducks, peking ducks, geese, and transgenic species thereof<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the subject is in need of treatment by the methods of the invention, and is selected for treatment based on this need. A subject in need of treatment is art-recognized, and includes subjects that have been identified as having a disease or disorder related to amyloid-deposition or amyloidosis, having a symptom of such a disease or disorder, or at risk of such a disease or disorder, and would be expected, based on diagnosis, e.g., medical diagnosis, to benefit fi-om treatment (e.g., curing, healing, preventing, alleviatmg, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or disorder, the symptom of the disease or disorder, or the risk ofthe disease or disorder).<br>
Administration ofthe compositions ofthe present invention to a subject to be treated can be carried out using known procedures, at dosages and for periods of time effective to inhibit amyloid deposition in the subject. An effective amount ofthe sulfonate derivatized compound necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect may vary according to factors such as the amount of amyloid already deposited at the clinical site<br><br>
\n. liie subject, the age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the sulfonate derivatized compound to inhibit amyloid deposition in the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by tlie exigencies of the therapeutic situation. A non-limiting example of an effective dose range for a sulfonate derivatized compound of the invention {e.g., 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid) is between 1 and 500 mg/kg of body weight/per day. Oneof ordinary skill in the art would be able to study the relevant factors and make the detemiination regarding the effective amount of the sulfonate derivatized compound without undue experimentation.<br>
Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of tliis invention may be varied soastoobtainanamount of the active ingredient that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.<br>
The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.<br>
A medical doctor, e.g.., physician or veterinarian, having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amoimt of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition af levels lower than that required in order to aclueve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually   , increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
The regimen of administration can affect what constitutes an effective amount. The formulations can be administered to the subject either prior to or after the onset of amyloidosis. Further, several divided dosages, as well as staggered dosages, can be administered daily or sequentially, or the dose can be continuously infiised, or can be a bolus injection. Further, the dosages of the formulations can be proportionally increased or decreased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic or prophylactic situation.<br>
In particular embodiments, it is especially advantageous to formulate compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and unifomiity of dosage. Dosage unit fomi as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary<br><br>
dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of sulfonate derivatized compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the sulfonate derivatized compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding/formulating such a sulfonate derivatized compound for the treatment of amyloid deposition in subjects.<br>
The formulations described hereinbefore, can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition in an amornit effective to inhibit amyloidosis in a phamiaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds according to any of the formulae recited herein, and/or any of the specifically recited compounds, e.g., compounds included in Tables 2, 3 and 4, for the hreatment of an amyloid-related disease, as well as methods of manufacturing such pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The sulfonate derivatized compound may also be administered parenterally, intraperitoneally, intvaspinally, or intracerebrally. Dispersions can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
To administer the sulfonate derivatized compound by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the sulfonate derivatized compound may be administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Phannaceutically acceptable diluents include, for example, saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Strejan et al., (1984) J. Neuroimmunol. 7:27).<br>
hi one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous pr^aration of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.<br><br>
iuc i;imjcr can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as matmitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of die injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the sulfonate derivatized compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the sulfonate derivatized compound info a sterile carrier, which contains, for example, a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying, which yield a powder of the active ingredient (i.e., the sulfonate derivatized compound) plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
The sulfonate derivatized compound can be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The sulfonate derivatized compound and other ingredients may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the sulfonate derivatized compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The percentage of the sulfonate derivatized compound in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied. The amount of the sulfonate derivatized compound in such therapeutically usefiil compositions is such that a suitable dosage is obtained.<br>
The formulations suitable for oral administration may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well knovra in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound that produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will<br><br>
range from about 1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.<br>
The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other poljoner matrices, hposomes or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gasfrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.<br>
Methods of preparing these fomiulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, tlie formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the fonn of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, or any of the following: fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose.<br><br>
glucose, mannitol, or silicic acid; binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium sfearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weiglit polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropyimethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-hnked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
The sulfonate derivatized compounds of the invention are effective when administered orally. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a preferred route of administration is oral administration. To administer the sulfonate derivatized compound it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the therapeutically active compound may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and otlier natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated to ensure proper distribution ill vivo. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Stcejan et al., (1984) J Neuroimmunot. 7:27). For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds; and to ensure that the sulfonate derivatized compounds of the invention cross the BBB, they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs ("targeting moieties"), thus providing targeted dmg delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (19S9) J. CUn. Pharmacol. 29:685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S.<br><br>
5,416,016 to Low et ai); mamiosides (Umezawa et al, (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comraun. 153:1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al.,(\99S) FEES Lett. 357:140; M. Owais et al,(\99S) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:180); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et a/.,(1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233:134); gpl20 (Schreier ef a/.,(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:9090); see also K. Keinanen; M. L. Laukkanen (1994) FEBS Lett. 346:123; 5. J. Killion; L J. Fidler (1994) Immunomethods 4:273.<br>
In specific embodiments of the invention, the sulfonate derivatized compound is<br>

the release of the sulfonate derivatized compound, e.g., hydroxypropylmethylcellulose<br>
(HPMC), a glidant/diluent, e.g., silicated mycrocrystalline, a filler, e.g., dibasic calcium<br>
phosphate, abinder/desintegrant, e.g.. Starch 1500, a lubricant, e.g., stearic acid powder<br>

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents conmionly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubiUzing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, gemi, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfiuning and preservative agents.<br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof<br>
Powders can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of tliese substances.<br><br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absoiption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption such as aluminum raonostearate and gelatin.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of sulfonate derivatized compoimd calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the sulfonate derivatized compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inlierent in the art of compounding such a sulfonate derivatized compound for the treatment of amyloid deposition in subjects.<br>
The present invention therefore includes pharmaceutical formulations comprising the compounds of the Formulae described herein, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for aerosol, oral and parenteral administration. Also, the present invention includes such compounds, or salts thereof, which have been lyophilized and which may be reconstituted to form pharmaceutically acceptable formulations for administration, as by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Administration may also be intradermal or transdermal.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a compound of the Formulae described herein, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be administered orally or through inhalation as a solid, or may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously as a solution, suspension or emulsion. Altematively, the compounds or salts may also be administered by inhalation, intravenously or intramuscularly as a liposomal suspension.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations are also provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol, by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of the desired compound of any Formula herein, or a salt thereof, or a pluraUty of solid particles of the compound or salt. The desired formulation may be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization may be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the compoimds or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles<br><br>
should have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid compound of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, iu any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. Most preferably, the size of the solid particles or droplets will be from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose.<br>
Preferably, when the pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol is in the form of a liquid, the fomiulation will comprise a water-soluble compound of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in a carrier that comprises water. A surfactant may be present that lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization.<br>
Peroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions, and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol, and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, tragacanth, and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the subject compound is released in the gastrointestinal tract in the vicinity of the desired topical application, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phUialate, polyvinylacetate phflialate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, waxes, and shellac.<br>
Other compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject compounds include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms. Such compositions typically comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and maiuiitol; and binders such as acacia, raicrocrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Glidants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed above may also be included.<br>
The compositions of this invention can also be administered topically to a subject, e.g., by the direct laying on or spreading of the composition on the epidermal or<br><br>
epifljelial tissue of the subject, or transdermally via a "patch". Such compositions include, for example, lotions, creams, solutions, gels and solids. These topical compositions preferably comprise an effective amount, usually at least about 0.1%, and preferably from about 1% to about 5%, of a compound of the invention. Suitable carriers for topical administration preferably remain in place on the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the therapeutic compound. The carrier may include pharmaceutically accq)table emoUents, emulsifiers, thickening agents, solvents and the like.<br>
Blood-Brain Barrier<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the more hydrophilic sulfonate derivatized compounds of the invention cross the BBB, they can be formulated, for example, in Hposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes inay comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs ("targeting moieties"), thus providing targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (1989) J. Clin. Phannacol. 29:685).<br>
Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,416,016 to Low et al.)\ mannosides (Umezawa et al. (19S8) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comraun. 153:1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al. (1995) FEES Lett. 357:140; M. Owais et al (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:180); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al (1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233:134); gpl20 (Schreier et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:9090); see also K. Keinanen; M. L. Laukkanen (1994) FEES Lett. 346:123; J. J. Killion; L J. Fidler (1994) Innnmiomethods 4:273. hi a preferred embodiment, the sulfonate derivatized compounds of the invention are formulated in liposomes; in a more prefenred embodiment, the liposomes include a targeting moiety.<br>
To ensure that compounds of the invention cross the BBB, they may be coupled to a BBB transport vector (for review of BBB transport vectors and mechanisms, see Bickel, et al.,Adv. DrugDeliveiy Reviews, vol. 46, pp. 247-279, 2001). Exemplary transport vectors include cationized albumin or the 0X26 monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor; these proteins undergo absorptive-mediated and receptor-mediated<br><br>
Examples of other BBB transport vectors that target receptor-mediated transport systems into the brain include factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I, IGF-H), angiotensin II, atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP), interleukin I (IL-1) and transferrin. Monoclonal antibodies to the receptors which bind these factors may also be used as BBB transport vectors. BBB transport vectors targeting mechanisms for absorptive-mediated transcytosis include cationic moieties such as cationized LDL, albumin or horseradish peroxidase coupled with polyl&gt;^ine, cationized albumin or cationized immunoglobuUns. Small basic oligopeptides such as the dynoiphin analogue E-2078 and the ACTH analogue ebifatide can also cross the brain via absorptive-mediated transcytosis and are potential transport vectors.<br>
Other BBB transport vectors target systems for transporting nutrients into the brain. Examples of such BBB transport vectors include hexose moieties, e.g. glucose, monocarboxylic acids, e.g. lactic acid, neutral amino acids, e.g. phenylalanine, amines, e.g. choline, basic amino acids, e.g. arginine, nucleosides, e.g. adenosine, purine bases, e.g. adenine, and thyroid hormone, e.g. triiodothyridine. Antibodies to the extracellular domain of nutrient transporters can also be used as transport vectors. Other possible vectors include angiotensin n and ANP, which may be involved in regulating BBB permeability.<br>
In some cases, the bond linlcing the sulfonate derivatized compound to the transport vector may be cleaved following transport into the brain in order to liberate the biologically active compound. Exemplary linkers include disulfide bonds, ester-based linkages, thioether linkages, amide bonds, acid-labile linkages, and Schiff base linkages. Avidin/biotin linkers, in which avidin is covalently coupled to the BBB drug transport vector, may also be used. Avidin itself may also be a drug transport vector.<br>
In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention are useful for treating amyloidosis associated with any disease in which amyloid deposition occurs. CUnically, amyloidosis can be primary, secondary, familial or isolated. Moreover, amyloids have been categorized by the type of amyloidogenic protein contained within the amyloid.<br>
VI.       Amyloid-Related Diseases<br>
In one embodiment, the sulfonate derivatized compounds prepared by the methods of the present invention have use in pharmaceutical compositions use&amp;l in the treatment of amyloid-related diseases. Many amyloid-related diseases are known, and others doubtless exist.<br><br>
AA (Reactive) Amyloidosis<br>
Generally, AA amyloidosis is a manifestation of a number of diseases that provoke a sustained acute phase response. Such diseases include chronic inflammatory disorders, chronic local or systemic microbial infections, and malignant neoplasms. The most common form of reactive or secondary (AA) amyloidosis is seen as the result of long-standing inflammatory conditions. For example, patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Familial Mediterranean Fever (wliich is a genetic disease) can develop AA amyloidosis. The terms "AA amyloidosis" and "secondary (AA) amyloidosis" are used interchangeably.<br>
AA fibrils are generally composed of 8,000 Dalton fragments (AA peptide or protein) formed by proteolytic cleavage of serum amyloid A protein (ApoS AA), a circulating apolipoprotein which is mainly synthesized in hepatocytes in response to such cytokines as 11.^1, IL-6 and TNF. Once secreted, ApoSAA is complexed with HDL. Deposition of AA fibrils can be widespread in the body, with a preference for parenchymal organs. The kidneys are usually a deposition site, and the liver and the spleen may also be affected. Deposition is also seen in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and the skin.<br>
Underlying diseases which can lead to the development of AA amyloidosis include, but are not limited to inflanimatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy, Reiter's syndrome. Adult SfiD's disease, Behcet's syndrome, and Crohn's disease. AA deposits are also produced as a result of chronic microbial infections, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, decubitus ulcers, chronic pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, and Whipple's disease. Certain malignant neoplasms can also result in AA fibril amyloid deposits. These include such conditions as Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal carcinoma, carcinomas of gut, lung and urogenital tract, basal cell carcinoma, and hairy cell leukemia. Other imderlying conditions that may be associated with AA amyloidosis are Castteman's disease and Schnitzler's syndrome.<br>
AL Amyloidoses (Primmy Amyloidosis)<br>
AL amyloid deposition is generally associated with almost any dyscrasia of the B lymphocyte lineage, ranging from malignancy of plasma cells (multiple myeloma) to benign monoclonal gammopathy. At times, the presence of amyloid deposits may be a primary indicator of the underlying dyscrasia. AL amyloidosis is also described in detail in Current Drug Targets, 2004, 5 159-171.<br>
Fibrils of AL amyloid deposits are composed of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains or fragments thereof More specifically, the fragments are derived from the<br><br>
N-terminal region of the light chain (kappa or lambda) and contain all or part of the variable (VL) domain thereof. Deposits generally occur in the mesenchymal tissues, causing peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, carpal t^iimel syndrome, m^roglossia, restrictive cardiomyopathy, artliropathy of large joints, immune dyscrasias, myelomas, as well as occult dyscrasias. However, it should be noted that almost any tissue, particularly visceral organs such as the kidney, liver, spleen and heart, may be involved.<br>
Hereditaiy Systemic Amyloidoses<br>
There are many foims of hereditary systemic amyloidoses. Although they are relatively rare conditions, adult onset of symptoms and their inheritance patterns (usually autosomal dominant) lead to persistence of such disorders in the general population. Generally, the syndromes are attributable to point mutations in the precursor protein leading to production of variant amyloidogenic peptides or proteins. Table 1 summarizes the fibril composition of exemplary forms of these disorders.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
methionine for leucine at position 111 resulted in a severe cardiopathy in Danish patients.<br>
Amyloid deposits isolated from hbart tissue of patients with systemic amyloidosis have revealed that the deposits are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of TTR and fragments thereof, collectively referred to as ATTR, the full length sequences of which have beeai characterized. ATTR fibril components can be extracted from such plaques and their structiu-e and sequence determined according to the methods known in the art ie.g., Gustavsson, A., et ai. Laboratory Invest. 73: 703-708,1995; Kametani, F., et at, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 125: 622-62S, 19S4; Pras, M., et ai, PNAS 80: 539-42, 1983).<br>
Persons having point mutations in the molecule apolipoprotein AI (e.g., Gly-&gt;Arg26; Trp-&gt;^Arg50; Leu-&gt;Arg60) exhibit a form of amyloidosis ("Ostertag type") characterized by deposits of the protein apolipoprotein AI or fragments thereof (AApoAI). These patients have low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and present with a peripheral neuropathy or renal failure.<br>
A mutation in the alpha chain of the enzyme lysozyme (e.g., ne-&gt;TIir56 or Asp-&gt;His57) is the basis of another form of Ostertag-type non-neuropathic hereditary amyloid reported in English families. Here, fibrils of the mutant lysozyme protein (Alys) are deposited, and patients generally exhibit impaired renal iimction. This protein, unlike most of the fibril-forming proteins described herein, is usually present in whole (unfragmented) foi-m (Benson, M.D„e;fl/.CIBAFdn.Symp. 199: 104-131,1996).<br>
Immimoglobulin light chains tend to form aggregates in various morphologies, including fibrillar (e.g., AL amyloidosis and AH amyloidosis), granular (e.g., light chain deposition disease (LCDD), heavy chain deposition disease (HCDD), and light-heavy chain deposition disease (LHCDD)), crystalline (e.g.. Acquired Farconi's Syndome), and microtubular (e.g.. Cryoglobulinemia). AL and AH amyloidosis is indicated by the formation of insoluble fibrils of immunoglobulin light chains and heavy chain, respectively, and/or their fragments.   In AL fibrils, lambda (X) chains such as &gt;. VI chains (X6 chains), are found in greater concentrations than kappa (K) chains. XIII chains are also shghtly elevated. Merlini et ai, CLIN CHEM LABMED 39(ll):1065-75 (2001). Heavy chain amyloidosis (AH) is generally characterized by aggregates of gamma chain amyloid proteins of the IgGl subclass. Eulitzera/.,PROCNATLACADSciUSA 87:6542-46(1990).<br>
Comparison of amyloidogenic to non-amyloidogenic light chains has revealed that the former can include replacements or substitutions that appear to destabilize the folding of the protein and promote aggregation. AL and LCDD have been distinguished from other amyloid diseases due to their relatively small population monoclonal light<br><br>
chains, or fragments thereof, which are manufactured by necq&gt;lastic expansion of an antibody-producing B cell. AL aggregates typically are well-ordered fibrils of lambda chains. LCDD aggregates are relatively amorphous aggregations of both kappa and lambda chains, with a majority being kappa, in some cases KIV. Bellotti et al., JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY 13:280-89 (2000). Comparison of amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic heavy chains in patients having AH amyloidosis has revealed missing and/or altered components. Eulitz et al., PROCNATL ACAD SaUSA 87:6542-46 (1990) (pathogenic heavy chain characterized by significantly lower molecular mass than non-amyloidogenic heavy chains); and Solomon e/a/. AM J HEMAT 45(2) 171-6(1994) (amyloidogenic heavy chain characterized as consisting solely of the VH-D portion of the non-amyloidogenic heavy chain).<br>
Accordingly, potential methods of detecting and monitoring treatment of subjects having or at risk of having AL, LCDD, AH, and the like, include but are not limited to immunoassaying plasma or urine for the presence or depressed deposition of amyloidogenic light or heavy chains, e.g., amyloid X, amyloid K, amyloid KIV, amyloid y, or amyloid yl.<br>
Brain Amyloidosis<br>
The most frequent type of amyloid in the brain is composed primarily of Ap peptide fibrils, resulting in dementia associated with sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease. In fact, the incidence of sporadic Alzheimer's disease greatly exceeds forms shown to be hereditary. Nevertheless, fibril peptides forming plaques are very similar in both types. Brain amyloidosis includes those diseases, conditions, pathologies, and otlier abnormalities of the shTicture or fiinction of the brain, including components thereof, in which the causative agent is amyloid. The area of the brain affected in an amyloid-related disease may be the stroma including the vasculature or the parenchyma including fijnctional or anatomical regions, or neurons themselves. A subject need not have received a definitive diagnosis of a specifically recognized amyloid-related disease. The teim "amyloid-related disease" includes brain amyloidosis.<br>
Amyloid-p peptide ("Ap") is a 39-43 amino acid peptide derived by proteolysis from a large protein known as Beta Amyloid Precursor Protein ("PAPP"). Mutations in pAPP result in familial fomas of Alzlieimer's disease, Down's syndrome, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and senile dementia, characterized by cerebral deposition of plaques composed of Ap fibrils and other components, which are described in further detail below. Known mutations in APP associated with Alzheimer's disease occur proximate to the cleavage sites of P or y-secretase, or within Ap. For example, position 717 is proximate to the site of gamma-secretase cleavage of APP in its processing to Ap, and<br><br>
positions 670/671 are proximate to the site of P-secretase cleavage. Mutations at any of these residues may result in Alzheimer's disease, presumably by causing an increase in the amount of the 42/43 amino acid form of A|3 generated from APP. The familial form of Alzheimer's disease represents only 10% of the subject population. Most occurrences of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic cases where APP and Ap do not possess any mutation. The structure and sequence of Ap peptides of various lengths are well known in the art. Such peptides can be made according to methods known in the art, or extracted from the brain according to known methods (e.g., Glenner and Wong, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 129, S85-90 (1984); Glenner and Wong, 5ioc/iem. Biopbys. Res. Comm. 122,1131-35 (1984)). In addition, various forms of the peptides are commercially available. APP is expressed and constitutively catabolized in most cells. The dominant catabolic pathway appears to be cleavage of APP within the AP sequence by an enzyme provisionally termed a-secretase, leading to release of a soluble ectodomain fragment known as APPsa. This cleavage precludes the formation of Ap peptide. In contrast to this non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP can also be cleaved by enzymes known as p- and y-secretase at the N- and C-termini of the Ap , respectively, followed by release of Ap into the extracellular space. To date, BACE has been identified as P-secretase (Vasser, et ciL, Science 286:735-741, 1999) and presenilins have been implicated in y-secretase activity (De Strooper, et al. Nature 391, 387-90 (1998)). The 39-43 amino acid Ap peptide is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid prcciu-sor protein (APP) by tlie p and y secretases enzyme. Although Ap40 is the predominant fomi produced, 5-7% of total Ap exists as Ap42 (Cappai et al. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 31. BB,S-^9 {1999)).<br>
The length of the AP peptide appears to dramatically alter its biochemical/biophysical properties. Specifically, the additional two amino acids at the C-terminus of Ap42 are very hydrophobic, presumably increasing the propensity of Ap42 to aggregate. For example, Jarrett, et al. demonstrated that AP42 aggregates very rapidly in vitro compared to Ap40, suggesting that the longer forms of Ap may be the important pathological proteins tliat are involved in the initial seeding of the neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (Jarrett, et al, Biochemistty 32,4693-97 (1993); Jarrett, et aI.,Aiin. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 695, 144-48 (1993)). This hypothesis has been further substantiated by the recent analysis of the contributions of specific forms of AP in cases of genetic familial forms of Alzheimer's disease ("FAD"). For example, the "London" mutant form of APP (APPV717I) linked to FAD selectively increases the production of Ap 42/43 forms versus Ap 40 (Suzuki, et al. Science 264,1336-40 (1994)) while the "Swedish" mutant form of APP (APPK670N/M671L) increases levels of both Ap40 and Ap42/43 (Citron, et al. Nature 360, 672-674 (1992); Cai, et al. Science 259, 514-16, (1993)). Also, it has been observed that FAD-linked mutations in the Preseni!in-1<br><br>
("PSl") or PreseniIin-2 ("PS2") genes will lead to a selective increase in Ap42/43 production but not Ap40 (Borchelt, el al. Neuron 17, 1005-13 (1996)). This finding was corroborated in transgenic mouse models expressing PS mutants that demonstrate a selective increase in brain AP42 (Borchelt, op cit.; Duff, et al., Neurodegeneration 5(4), 293-98 (1996)). Thus the leading hypothesis xegaidmg the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is that an increase in Ap42 brain concentration due to an increased production and release of Ap42 or a decrease in clearance (degradation or brain clearance) is a causative event in the disease pathology.<br>
Multiple mutation sites in either Ap or the APP gene have been identified and are clinically associated with either dementia or cerebral hemorrhage. Exemplary CAA disorders include, but are not limited to, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Icelandic type (HCHWA-I); the Dutch variant of HCHWA (HCHWA-D; a mutation in Ap); the Flemish mutation of Ap; the Arctic mutation of Ap; the Italian mutation of Ap; the Iowa mutation of Ap; familial British dementia; and familial Danish dementia. CAA may also be sporadic.<br>
As used herein, the terms "p amyloid," "amyloid-p," and the like refer to amyloid p proteins or peptides, amyloid p precursor proteins or peptides, intermediates, and modifications and fragments thereof, unless otherwise specifically indicated. In particular, "Ap" refers to any peptide produced by proteolytic processing of the APP gene product, especially peptides which are associated with amyloid pathologies, incIiidingApl-39,Api-40,Apl-4],ApI-42, and ApJ-43. For convenience of nomenclature, "Apl-42" maybe referred to herein as "Ap(l-42)" or simply as "Ap42" or "Apdj" (and likewise for any other amyloid peptides discussed herein). As used herein, the tenns "p amyloid," "amyloid-p," and "Ap" are synonymous.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the terra "amyloid" refers to amyloidogenic proteins, peptides, or firagments thereof which can be soluble (e.g., monomeric or oligomeric) or insoluble (e.g., having fibrillary structure or in amyloid plaque). See, e.g., MP Lambert, el al.,Proc. Nat'lAcad. Set. USA 95,644S~53 (1998). "Amyloidosis" or "amyloid disease" or "amyloid-related disease" refers to a pathological condition characterized by the presence of amyloid fibers. "Amyloid" is a generic term referring to a group of diverse but specific protein deposits (intracellular or extracellular) which are seen in a number of different diseases. Though diverse in their occurrence, all amyloid deposits have conmion morphologic properties, stain with specific dyes (e.g., Congo red), and have a characteristic red-green bire&amp;ingent appearance in polarized light after staining. They also share comnion ultrastmcturaJ features and common X-ray diffraction and inirared spectra.<br><br>
Gelsolin is a calcium binding protein that binds to fragments and actin filaments. Mutations at position 187 (e.g., Asp-&gt;Asn; Asp^^Tyr) ofthe protein result in a form of hereditary systemic amyloidosis, usually found in patients from Finland, as well as persons of Dutch or Japanese origin. In afflicted individuals, fibrils foimed from gelsolin fragments (Agel), usually consist of amino acids 173-243 (68 kDa carboxytemiinal fragment) and are deposited in blood vessels and basement membranes, resulting in corneal dystrophy and cranial neuropathy which progresses to peripheral neuropathy, dystrophic skin changes and deposition in other organs. (Kangas, H., et al. Human Mol. Genet. 5(9): 1237-1243,1996).<br>
Other mutated proteins, such as mutant alpha chain of fibrinogen (AfibA) and mutant cystatin C (Acys) also form fibrils and produce characteristic hereditary disorders. AfibA fibrils form deposits characteristic of a nonneuropathic hereditary amyloid with renal disease; Acys deposits are characteristic of a hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy reported in Iceland (Isselbacher, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, McGraw-Hill, San Francisco, 1995; Benson, et al.). In at least some cases, patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) have been shown to have amyloid fibrils containing a non-mutant form of cystatin C in conjunction with amyloid beta protein (Nagai, A., et al. Molec. Chem. Neuropathol. 33: 63-78, 1998).<br>
Certain fonns of prion disease are now considered to be heritable, accounting for up to 15% of cases, winch were previously thought to be predominantly infectious in nature. (Baldwin, et al., in Research Advances in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1995). In hereditary and sporadic prion disorders, patients develop plaques composed of abnormal isoforms ofthe normal prion protein (PrP^').<br>
A predominant mutant isoform, PrP^'^, also referred to as AScr, differs from the normal cellular protein in its resistance to protease degradation, insolubility after detergent extraction, deposition in secondary lysosomes, post-translational synthesis, and high p-pleated sheet content. Genetic linkage has been established for at least five mutations resulting in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), Gerstniann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal famihal insomnia (FFI). (Baldwin, supra) Methods for extracting fibril peptides from scrapie fibrils, determining sequences and making such peptides are known in the art (e.g., Beekes, M., et al. J. Gen. Virol. 76:2567-76, 1995).<br>
For example, one form of GSS has been linked to a PrP mutation at codon 102, while telencephalic GSS segregates with a mutation at codon 117. Mutations at codons 198 and217result inaformof GSS m which neuritic plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease contain PrP instead of Ap peptide. Certain forms of familial CJD<br><br>
have been associated with mutations at codons 200 and 210; mutations at codons 129 and 178 have been found in both familial CJD and FFI. (Baldwin, supra).<br>
Cerebral Amyloidosis<br>
Local deposition of amyloid is common in the brain, particularly in elderly individuals. The most frequent type of amyloid in the brain is composed primarily of Ap peptide fibrils, resulting in dementia or sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease. The most common occurrences of cerebral amyloidosis are sporadic and not famihal. For example, the incidence of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and sporadic CAA greatly exceeds the incidence of familial AD and CAA, Moreover, sporadic and familial forms of the disease camiot be distinguished from each other (they differ only in the presence or absence of an inherited genetic mutation); for example, the clinical symptoms and the amyloid plaques formed in both sporadic and familial AD are very similar, if not identical.<br>
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) refers to the specific deposition of amyloid fibrils in tlie walls of leptomingeal and cortical arteries, arterioles and veins. It is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and normal aging, as well as with a variety of familial conditions related to stroke or dementia (see Frangione el al., Amyloid; J. Protein Folding Disord. S, Suppl. !, 36-42 (2001)). CAA can occur sporadically or be hereditary.<br>
Senile Systemic Amyloidosis<br>
Amyloid deposition, either systemic or focal, increases with age. For example, fibrils of wild type transthyretin (TTR) are commonly found in the heart tissue of elderly individuals. These may be asj/mptomatic, clinically silent, or may result in heart failure. Asympiomatic fibrillar focal deposits ma&gt;' also occur in the brain (AP), corpora amylacea of the prostate (P2 microglobulin), joints and seminal vesicles.<br>
Dialysis-related Amyloidosis (DRA)<br>
Plaques composed of jBi microglobulin (P2M) fibrils commonly develop in patients receiving long term hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, fc microglobulin is a 11 .S kiloDalton polypeptide and is the liglit chain of Class 1MHC antigens, which are present on all nucleated cells. Under nomia] circumstances, pjM is usually distributed in the extracellular space unless there is an impaired renal function, in which case PiM is iransDorted into tissues where it polymerizes to form amyloid fibrils. Failure of<br><br>
clearance such as in the case of impaired renal function, leads to deposition in the carpal tunnel and other sites (primarily in coUagen-rich tissues of the joints). Unlike other fibril proteins, P2M molecules are not produced by cleavage of a longer precursor protein and are generally present in unfragmented fonn in the fibrils. (Benson, supra). Retention and accumulation of this amyloid precursor has been shown to be the main pathogenic process imderlying DRA. DRA is characterized by peripheral joint osteoarthropathy (e.g., joint stiffiiess, pain, swelling, etc.). Isofonns of P2M, glycated P2M, or polymers of P2M in tissue are the most amyloidogenic form (as opposed to native P2M). Unlike other types of amyloidosis, P2M is confined largely to osteoarticular sites. Visceral depositions are rare. Occasionally, these deposits may involve blood vessels and other important anatomic sites.<br>
Despite improved dialysis methods for removal of P2M, the majority of patients have plasmatic P2M concentrations that remain dramatically higher than normal. These elevated piM concentrations generally lead to Diabetes-Related Amyloidosis (DRA) and cormorbidities that contribute to mortality.<br>
Islet Amyloid Polypeptide and Diabetes<br>
Islet hyalinosis (amyloid deposition) was first described over a century ago as the presence of fibrous protein aggregates in the pancreas of patients with severe hyperglycemia (Opie, EL., J Exp. Med. 5: 397-428,1901). Today, islet amyloid, composed pi-edominantly of islet amyloid polypeptide (lAPP), or amylin, is a characteristic histopathological marker in over 90% of all cases of Type 11 diabetes (also known as Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes; or NIDDM). These fibrillar accumulations result from the aggregation of the islet amyloid polypeptide (lAPP) or amylin, which is a 37 amino acid peptide, derived from a larger precursor peptide, called pro-IAPI*.<br>
lAPP is co-secreted with insulin in response to p-cell secretagogues. This pathological feature is not associated with insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes and is a unifying characteristic for the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes diagnosed as NiDDM (Type U diabetes).<br>
Longitudinal studies in cats and immunocytochemical investigations in monkeys have shown that a progressive increase in islet amyloid is associated with a dramatic decrease in the population of insulin-secreting p-cells and increased severity of the disease. More recently, transgenic studies have strengthened the relationship between lAPP plaque fomiation and p-cell apoptosis and dysfunction, indicating that amyloid deposition is a principal factor in increasing severity of Type H diabetes.<br><br>
lAPP has also been shown to induce p-islet ceil toxicity in vitro, indicating that appearance of lAPP fibrils in the pancreas of Type H or Type I diabetic patients (post-islet transplantation) could contribute to the loss of the p-ceJl islets (Langerhans) and organ dysfunction.   In patients with Type H diabetes, the accumulation of pancreatic lAPP leads to formation of oligomeric lAPP, leading to a buildup of lAPP-amyloid as insoluble fibrous deposits which eventually destroys the insuUn-producing p cells of the islet, resulting in p cell depletion and failure (Westermark, P., Grimelius, L., Ada Path. Microbiol. Scand., sect. A. 81: 291-300,1973; de Koning, EJP., et ai, Diabetologia 36: 378-384, 1993; mdLorenzo, A., e/al.,Nali/re 368: 756-760, 1994). Accumulation of lAPP as fibrous deposits can also have an impact on the ratio of pro-IAPP to lAPP normally found in plasma by increasing this ratio due to the trapping of lAPP in deposits. Reduction of p cell mass can be manifested by h&gt;^erglyceniia and insulinemia. This 0-cell mass loss can lead to a need for insulin therapy.<br>
Diseases caused by the death or malfunctioning of a particular type or types of cells can be (realed by transplanting into the patient healthy cells of the relevant type of cell. This approach has been used for Type I diabetes patients. Often pancreatic islet cells from a donor are cultured;« vitro prior to transplantation, to allow them to recover after the isolation procedure or to reduce their imnmnogenicity. However, in many instances islet cell transplantation is unsuccessfiil, due to death of the transplanted cells. One reason for this poor success rate is lAPP, which organizes into toxic oligomers. Toxic effects may result fi'om intracellular and extracellular accumulation of fibril oligomers. The LAPP oligomers can form fibrils and become toxic to the cells in vitro. In addition, LAPP fibrils are likely to continue to grow after the cells are transplanted and cause death or dysfunction of the cells. This-may occur even when the cells are from a healthy donor and the patient receiving the transplant does not have a disease that is characterized by the presence of fibrils. For example, compounds of the present invention may also be used in preparing tissues or cells for transplantation according to the methods described in International Patent Application (PCT) number WO 01/003680.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also stabilize the ratio of the concentrations of Pro-IAPP/IAPP, pro-Insulin/Insulin and C-peptide levels. In addition, as biological markers of efficacy, the results of the different tests, such as the arginine-insulin secretion test, the glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance and sensitivity tests, could all be used as markers of reduced p-cell mass and/or accumulation of amyloid deposits. Such class of drugs could be used together with other drugs targeting insulin resistance, hepatic glucose production, and insulin secretion. Such compounds might prevent<br><br>
insulin therapy by preserving P-cell function and be applicable to preserving islet transplants.<br>
Honnone-derived Amyloidoses<br>
Endocrine organs may harbor amyloid deposits, particularly in aged individuals. Honnone-secreting tumors may also contain hormone-derived amyloid plaques, the fibrils of which are made up of polypeptide hormones such as calcitonin (medullary carcinoma of the thyroid), and atrial natriuretic peptide (isolated atrial amyloidosis). Sequences and structures of these proteins are well known in the art.<br>
Miscellaneous Amyloidoses<br>
There are a variety of other forms of amyloid disease that are normally manifest as localized deposits of amyloid. In general, these diseases are probably the result of the localized production or lack of catabolism of specific fibril precursors or a predisposition of a particular tissue (such as the joint) for fibril deposition. Examples of such idiopathic deposition include nodular AL amyloid, cutaneous amyloid, endocrine amyloid, and tumor-related amyloid. Other amyloid-related diseases include those described in Table 1, such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), senile systemic amyloidosis, Tcnosynovium, familial amyloidosis, Ostertag-type, non-neuropathic amyloidosis, cranial neuropathy, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, familial dementia, chronic dialysis, familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, hereditary spongifomi encephalopathies, prion diseases, familial Mediterranean fever, Muckle-Well's syndrome, nephropathy, deafiiess, urticaria, limb pain, cai'diomyopathy, cutaneous deposits, multiple myeloma, benign monoclonal gammopathy, maccoglobulinaemia, myeloma associated amyloidosis, medullary cai'cinomas of the thyroid, isolated atrial amyloid, and diabetes.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated witli amyloid fibril formation, aggregation or deposition, regardless of the clinical setting. The compounds of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-related disease using any of the following mechanisms, such as, for example but not limited to: slowing the rate of amyloid fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid fibril formation; inhibiting amyloid induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid from, for example, the brain; or protecting cells from amyloid induced (oligomers or fibrillar) toxicity.<br>
In an embodiment, the compounds of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid-p fibril formation, aggregation or deposition. The compounds of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-P related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of amyloid-p fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid-P deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid-p fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid-p; inhibiting amyloid-p induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid-P from the brain; or favoring greater catabolism of Ap.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be effective in controlling amyloid-p deposition either following their entry into the brain (following penetration of the blood brain barrier) or from the periphery. When acting from the periphery, a compound may alter the equilibrium of Ap between the brain and the plasma so as to favor the exit of Ap from the brain. An increase in the exit of Ap from the brain would result in a decrease in Ap brain concentration and therefore favor a decrease in Ap deposition. In addition, compounds that penetrate the brain may control deposition by acting directly on brain Ap, e.g., by maintaining it In a non-fibrillar form or favoring its clearance from the brain. The compounds may slow down APP processing; may increase degradation of Ap fibrils by macrophages or by neuronal cells; or may decrease Ap production by activated microglia. These compounds could also prevent Ap in the brain from interacting with the cell surface and therefore prevent neui'otoxicity, neurodegeneration, or inflammation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, tlie metiiod is ijsed to freat Alzheimer's disease {e.g., sporadic or familial AD). The method can also be used prophylactically or therapeutically to treat other clinical occurrences of amyloid-p deposition, such as in Down's syndrome individuals and in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA"), hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, or early Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In another embodiment, the method is used to treat mild cognitive impairment. Mild Cognitive Impairment ("MCI") is a condition characterized by a state of mild but measurable impairment in thinking skills, which is not necessarily associated with the presence of dementia. MCI frequently, but not necessarily, precedes Alzheimer's<br>
disease.<br>
Additionally, abnormal accumulation of APP and of amyloid-p protein in muscle fibers has been implicated in the pathology of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) (Askanas, V., et al. (1996) Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA 93: 1314-1319; Askanas, V. et al. (1995) Current Opinion in Rheumatology 7:486-496). Accordingly, the compounds of<br><br>
the invention can be used prophyiactically or therapeutically in the treatment of disorders in which amyloid-beta protein is abnormally deposited at non-neurological locations, such as treatment of IBM by delivery of the compounds to muscle fibers.<br>
Additionally, it has been shovm that Ap is associated with abnormal extracellular deposits, known as drusen, that accumulate along the basal surface of the retinal pigmented epithelium in individuals vwth age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). ARMD is a cause of irreversible vision loss in older individuals. It is believed that Ap deposition could be an important component of the local inflammatory events that contribute to atrophy of the retinal pigmented epitheliimi, drusen biogenesis, and the pathogenesis of ARMD (Johnson, ei al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99(18), 11830-5 (2002)).<br>
In another embodiment, the invention also relates to a method of treating or preventing an amyloid-related disease in a subject (preferably a human) comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic amount of a compound according to the following Formulae or otherwise described herein, such that amyloid fibril formation or deposition, neurodegeneration, or cellular toxicity is reduced or inhibited. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating or preventing an amyloid-related disease in a subject (preferably a human) comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic amount of a compound according to the following Formulae or otherwise described herein, such that cognitive function is improved or stabilized or further deterioration in cognitive function is prevented, slowed, or stopped in patients with brain amyloidosis, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These compounds can also improve quality of daily living in these subjects.<br>
The therapeutic compounds of the invention may treat amyloidosis related to type n diabetes by, for example, stabilizing glycemia, preventing or reducing the loss of p cell mass, reducing or preventing hyperglycemia due to loss of p cell mass, and modulating (e.g., increasing or stabilizing) insulin production. The compounds of the invention may also stabilize the ratio of the concentrations of pro-IAPP/IAPP.<br>
The therapeutic compounds of the invention may treat AA (secondary) amyloidosis and/or AL (primary) amyloidosis, by stabilizing renal fimction, decreasing proteinuria, increasing creatinine clearance (e.g., by at least 50% or greater or by at least lOOVoorgreater), or by leading to remission of chronic diarrhea, or weight gain (e.g.,<br>
10% or greater).<br>
The language "inhibition of amyloid deposition" includes reducing, preventing or stopping of amyloid formation, e.g., fibrillogenesis, inhibiting or slowing down of further amyloid deposition in a subject with amyloidosis, e.g., already having amyloid<br><br>
deposits, and reducing or reversing amyloid fibrillogenesis or deposits in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis. For example, the extent of the inhibition of amyloid deposition is conteinpl3.ted by the instant application as a range, which can include, for example, substantially complete elimination of amyloid deposition or reduction of amyloid deposition, hihibition of amyloid deposition is determined relative to an untreated subject,orrelativeto the treated subject prior to treatment, or, e.g., determined by clinically measurable improvement in pancreatic function in a diabetic patient, or in the caseof a patient with brain amyloidosis, e.g., an Alzheimer's or cerebral amyloid angiopathy patient, stabilization of cognitive function or prevention of a further decrease in cognitive function {i.e., preventing, slowing, or stopping disease progression), or improvement of parameters such as the concentration of Ap or tau in the CSF. In certain embodiments, amyloid deposition may be inhibited by, for example, inhibiting an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a constituent of basement membrane, enhancing clearance of amyloid p from the brain, or inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid (e.g., by soluble or insoluble amyloid, e.g., fibrils, by amyloid deposition and/or by amyloid-p, as described herein), or protecting brain cells &amp;om the detrimental effect of Ap.<br>
As used herein, "treatment" of a subject includes the application or administration of a composition of the invention to a subject, or application or administration of a composition ofthe invention to a cell or tissue from a subject, who lias an amyloid-related disease or condition, has a symptom of such a disease or condition, or is at risk of (or susceptible to) such a disease or condition, with the purpose of curing, healing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or condition, the symptom ofthe disease or condition, or the risk of (or susceptibility to) the disease or condition.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, in some aspects the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain a compoimd that prevents or inhibits amyloid fibril formation, either in the brain or other organ of interest (acting locally) or throughout the entire body (acting systemically). Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be effective in controlling amyloid deposition either following their entry into the brain (following penetration of the blood brain barrier) or from the periphery. When acting from the periphery, a compound of a pharmaceutical composition may alter the equilibrium of amyloidogenic peptide between the brain and the plasma to favor the exit of amyloidogenic peptide from the brain. It may also favor clearance (or catabolism) of the amyloid protein (soluble), and then prevent amyloid fibril formation and deposition due to a reduction of the amyloid protein pool in a specific organ, e.g., liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, joints, brain, etc. An increase in the exit of amyloidogenic peptide from the brain would result in a decrease in amyloidogenic peptide brain concentration, and therefore, favor a decrease in amyloidogenic peptide deposition. In particular, an agent may lower the levels of amyloid P peptides, e.g., both Ap40 and AP42 in the CSF and the plasma, or the agent may lower the levels of amyloid P peptides, e.g., Ap40 and Ap42 in the CSF and increase it in the plasma. Alternatively, compounds that penetrate the brain could control deposition by acting directly on brain amyloidogenic peptide e.g., by maintaining it in a non-fibrillar form or favoring its clearance fi-om the brain, by increasing its degradation in the-brain, or protecting brain cells from the detrimental effect of amyloidogenic peptide. An agent can also cause a decrease of the concentration of the amyloid protein (i.e., in a specific organ so that the critical concentration needed to trigger amyloid fibril formation or deposition is not reached). Furthemiore, die compounds described herein may inhibit or reduce an interaction between amyloid and a cell surface constituent, for example, a glycosaminoglycan or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane. The compounds may also prevent an amyloid peptide from binding or adhering to a cell surface, a process that is known to cause cell damage or toxicity. Similarly, the compounds may block amyloid-induced cellular toxicity or microglial activation or amyloid-induced neurotoxicity, or inhibit amyloid induced inflammation. The compounds may also reduce the rate or amount of amyloid aggregation, fibril formation, or deposition, or the compounds may lessen the degree of amyloid deposition. The foregoing mechanisms of action should not be construed as limitmg the scope of the invention inasmuch as Uie invention may be practiced without such information.<br><br>
The language "basement membrane" refers to an extracellular matrix comprising glycoproteins and proteoglycans, including laminin, collagen type IV, fibronectin, agrin, perlecan, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). In one embodiment, amyloid deposition is inhibited by interfering with an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a sulfated glycosamiuoglycan such as HSPG. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans are known to be present in at! types of amyloids (iee Snow, A. T&gt;.,etal. Lab. Stvest. 56, 120-123 (1987)) and amyloid deposition and HSPG deposition occur coincidentally in animal models of amyloidosis (see Snow, A. D-, e( af.. Lab. hivest. 56, 665-675 (1987)). Consensus binding site motifs for HSPG in arayloidogenic proteins have been described, see, e.^.,Cardin and Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9,21-32 (1989).<br>
In another embodiment, the therapeutic formulation is capable of inhibiting an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a glycoprotein or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane to thus inhibit amyloid deposition. The ability of a sulfonate derivatized compound of the invention to inhibit an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a glycoprotein or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane can be assessed by an in vitro binding assay, such as that described in the Exemplification or in U.S. 5,164,295 by Kisilevsky et ai Briefly, a solid support such as a polystyrene microliter plate is coated with an amyloidogenic protein {e.g., serum amyloid A protein or p-amyioid precursor protein (p-APP)) and any residual hydrophobic surfaces are blocked. The coated solid support is incubated with various concentrations of a constituent of basement membrane, preferably HSPG, either in the presence or absence of a compound to be tested. The solid support is washed extensively to remove unbound material. The binding of the basement membrane constituent (e.g., HSPG) to the amyloidogenic protein (e.g., p-APP) is then measured using an antibody directed against the basement membrane constituent which is conjugated to a detectable substance (e.g., an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase) by detecting the detectable substance. A compound that inhibits an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a glycoprotein or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane will reduce the amount of substance detected (e.g., will inhibit the amount of enzyme activity detected).<br>

To degassed water (550 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere sodium sulfite (150 g. 1.19 mol) was loaded in one-portion. The mixture was stirred for 10 min. at room temperature. (In fact, effective stirring was applied throughout the entire reaction process.) After the dissolution of the sodium sulfite, the mixture was cooled to around 10 °C (internal temperature). To the cooled mixture was added a solution of 1,3-propane sultone (155 g, 1.27 mol) in acetone (100 luL) dropwise, or through a cannula over a 60-min. period. The rate of the addition was adjusted to maintain the internal temperature below 15 "C.<br>
The internal temperature was kept at a temperature below 15 °C for 15 min. after the completion of the addition, and then warmed to 15 "C. The mixture was then stirred for 3 h at 15 °C. The mixture was subsequently cooled to an internal temperature of 10°C. To the cold, stirred mixture, absolute ethanol (900 g, 1.1 L) was added through an addition fimnel or a cannula over a period of 45-60 min. Moreover, the temperature was maintained below 15 °C during the ethanol addition.<br>
The suspension was stirred for a minimum 2 h at 5 "C (internal temperature). The solid material was collected from the cold mixture by suction-filtration. The filter cake was washed with 9Q% ethanol (2 x 'iQQ mL), and air-dried under reduced pressure for about 60 min. The air-dried filter-cake was dissolved in Millipore water (about 300 mL), such that the total weiglif of the filter cake and the water added did not exceed 770 g, (which required heating the mixture briefly to make sure a complete dissolution occurred). The pH of the solution was adjusted to 9-10 using 1 N sodium hydroxide.<br>
The solution was filtered through filter-paper (or on-line filter). The filtrate was then stirred and cooled to 10 °C (internal temperature). To the stirred, cold mixture, absolute ethanol (9S0 g, 1.2 L) was added through an addition funnel or a carmula over a period of 60-90 min. The temperature was maintained below 15 °C during the addition period, and the suspension thus obtained was stirred at 5 °C (internal temperature) for a minimum 2 h after tlie completion of the ethanol addition.
