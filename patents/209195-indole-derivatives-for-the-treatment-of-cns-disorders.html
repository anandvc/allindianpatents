INDOLE DERIVATIVES USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF CNS DISORDERS Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of indole derivatives having affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor. The compounds have antagonistic effect at the dopamine D4 receptor and are therefore useful in the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurologic disorders, in particular psychoses. Some of the compounds also have affinity for the S-HTIA and/or the 5-HT2C receptor and some of the compounds are serotonin reuptake inhibitors.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
AT 332401 discloses compounds of the general formula<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl, R1 and R2 are hydrogen or alkyl, p is 2 or 3 and X1 is hydrogen, fluoro, chloro or bromo. The compounds are said to be useful as neuroleptics. The patent does not contain any experimental data.<br>
WO 95/11680 relates to a broad class of compounds having antipsychotic activity. One group of compounds claimed are compounds having the formula<br><br><br>
wherein X1 is O, S, NH orNR2, Alk is alkylene, W1i is CH2, O, S or NH, and R is hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxyl, halogen, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, nitro, alkylthio, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, acylamino, trifluoroacetyl, arainocarbonyl, monoalkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, etc. The application does not explain any mechanism of action, but the compounds are said to have a reduced tendency to cause extrapyramidal side effects.<br>
Dopamine D4 receptors belong to the dopamine D2 subfamily of receptors which is considered to be responsible for the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics. The side effects of neuroleptic drugs which primarily exert their effect via antagonism of D2 receptors are known to be due to D2 receptor antagonism in the striatal regions of the brain. However, dopamine D4 receptors are primarily located in areas of the brain other than striatum, suggesting that selective antagonists of the dopamine D4 receptor will be devoid of extrapyramidal side effects. This is illustrated by the antipsychotic clozapine, which exerts higher afQnity for D4 than D2 receptors and is lacking extrapyramidal side effects (VanTol et al. Nature 1991, 250, 610; Hadley Medicinal Research Reviews 1996, 16, 507-526, and SannerZvp. Opiiu Tlier, Patents 1998, 5, 383-393).<br>
A number of D4 ligands, which were postulated to be selective D4 receptor antagonists (L-745,879 and U-10195S), have been shown to posses antipsychotic potential (Mansbach et al. Psychopharmacology 1998, 135, 194-200). However, recently it has been reported that these compounds are partial D4 receptor agonists in various in vitro efficacy assays (Gazi et al. Br, J. Pharmacol 1998,124, S89-S96 and Gazi et al Br. 1 Pharmacol 1999, 128, 613-620). Furthermore, it was shown that clozapine, which is an effective antipsychotic, is a silent D4 antagonists (Gazi et al. Br. J. Pharmacol 1999,128, 613-620).<br>
Consequently, D4 ligands which are partial D4 receptor agonists or antagonists may have beneficial effects against psychoses.<br>
Dopamine D4 antagonists may also be useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits (Jentsch   . et al. Psychopharmacology 1999,142, 78-84),<br><br>
Furthermore, evidence for a genetic association between the "primarily inattentive" subtype of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (.ADHD) and a tandem duplication polymorphism in the gene encoding the dopamine D4 receptor has been published (McCracken et al. Mol Psychiatry 2000, 5, 531-536). This clearly indicates a link between the dopamine D4 receptor and ADHD, and ligands affecting this receptor may be useful for the treatment of this particular disorder.<br>
Various effects are known with respect to compounds which are ligands at the different serotonin receptor subtypes. As regards the 5-HT:A receptor, which was previously referred to as the 5-HT2 receptor, the following effects have been reported, e.g.:<br>
Antidepressive effect and improvement of the sleep quality (Meert et al. Drug. Dev. Res, 1989, 75, 119), reduction of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and of extrapyi'amidal side effects caused by treatment with classical neuroleptics in schizoplirenic patients (Gelders British J. Psychiatiy 1989, 155 (suppl. 5), 33). Furthermore, selective 5-HT2A antagonists could be effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of migi'aine (Scrip Report; "Migraine - Current trends in research and treatment"; PJB Publications Ltd.; May 1991) and in the treatment of anxiety (Colpart et al. Psychopharmacology 1985, S6, 303-305 and Perregaard et al. Current Opinion in Therapeutic Patents 1993, 7, 101-128).<br>
Some clinical studies implicate the 5-HT2 receptor subtype in aggressive behaviour. Furthermore, atypical serotonin-dopamine antagonist neuroleptics have 5-HT2 receptor antagonistic effect in addition to their dopamine blocking properties and have been reported to possess anti-aggressive behaviour (Cormor et al. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, 8(4), 350-351).<br>
Recently, evidence has also accumulated which support the rationale for selective 5-HT2A antagonists as drugs capable of treating positive syinptoms of psychosis (Leysen et al. Current Pharmaceutical Design 1997, 3, 367-390 and Carlsson Current Opinion in CPNS Investigational Drugs 2000, 2(1), 22-24).<br>
Compounds which are 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are well-known antidepressant drugs.<br><br>
5-HT2C ligands have been found to augment the effect of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors in microdialysis experiments and animal models, and compounds having 5-HT reuptake inhibiting effect combined with affinity for the 5-HT2c receptor may therefore be particularly useful for the treatment of depression and other disorders responsive to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (PCT application No. PCT/DKOO/00671).<br>
Accordingly, dopamine D4 receptor ligands are potential drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses, and compounds with combined effects at the 5-HT transporter may have the further benefit of improved effect on depressive and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Compounds with combined effect at the dopamme D4 receptor and the 5-HT2A receptor may have the benefit of improved effect on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the benefit of effect on depressive and anxiety symptoms.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention are considered useful in the. treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without inducing extrapyramidal side effects.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide compounds that are partial agonists or antagonists at the dopamine D4 receptor and such compounds with combined effects at the dopamine D4 receptor, the 5-HT2A receptor, the 5-HT2C and/or the 5-HT transporter.<br>

solutions for injection. For preparing such compositions, methods well known in the art may be used, and any pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or other additives normally used in the art may be used.<br>
Conveniently, the compounds of the invention arc administered in unit dosage form containing said compounds in an amount of about 0.01 to 100 mg.<br>
The total daily dose is usually in the range of about 0.05 - 500 mg, and most preferably about O.I to 50 mg of the active compound of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared as follows:<br>
1)	Alkylating a piperazine, piperidine or tctrahydropyridinc of formula II with an<br>
alkylating derivative of formula III:<br><br>
1	O<br>
wherein R1 -R8 , X, W, n, m and the dotted line are as previously defined, and L is a leaving group such as e.g. halogen, mesylate or tosylate;<br>
2)	Reductive alkylation of an amine of formula II with a reagent of formula IV:<br><br>
wherein R1,R8, X, W, n, m and the dotted line are as previously defined, and E is an aldehyde or an activated carboxylic acid;<br><br>
3)	Reducing the double bond in the tetrahydropyridinyl ring in derivatives of formula<br>
V:<br><br>
wherein R -R , W, n and m are as previously defined;<br>
4)	Acylating an amine of foiTnula VI<br><br>
wherein R1-R8 XW, n, m and the dotted line are as previously defined by the use of a carboxylic acid and a coupling reagent, an activated ester, an acid chloride, an isocyanate, a carbamoyl chloride or a by a two-step procedure by treatment with phosgene followed by addition of an amine;<br>
5)	Cleaving a polymer bound derivative of formula VII<br><br><br>
wherein R1-R7', X, W, n and m are as previously defined and R'OH is hydroxyethyl or hydroxymethyl polystyrene, Wang resin or analogous polyethylene glycol polystyrene resins; whereupon the compound of Formula I is isolated as the free base or a pharma-ceutically acceptable acid addition sah thereof.<br>
The alkylation according to method 1) is conveniently performed in an inert organic solvent such as a suitably boiling alcohol or ketone, preferably in the presence of an organic or inorganic base (potassium carbonate, diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine) at reflux temperature. Alternatively, the alkylation can be performed at a fixed temperature which is different from the boiling point, in one of the above-mentioned solvents or in dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or 1H-methylpyrroIidin-2-one (NMP), preferably in the presence of a base. The synthesis of the amines of formula II, 3-(piperidin-4-yl)-lH-indoles and 3-(3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridin-4-yl)-lH-indoles, has been described in the literature (see EP-Al-465398).<br>
The alkylating derivatives of formula III are prepared by nitration of the alkyl-substituted phenylacctic acids followed by reduction of the nitro group, e.g. with tin(II) chloride and functionalization of the produced amino group. The carboxylic acid is subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohol, e.g. by treatment with borane followed by conversion of the alcohol to a leaving group, e.g. by treatment with methane sulfonyl chloride or thionyl bromide.<br>
The reductive alkylation according to method 2) is performed by standard literature methods. The reaction can be performed in two steps, e.g. coupling of amines of formula II with reagent of formula IV by standard methods via the carboxylic acid chloride, activated esters or by the use of carboxylic acids in combination with a coupling reagent such as e.g. dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, followed by reduction of the resulting amide with lithium aluminium hydride or alane. The carboxylic acid of formula IV is prepared by nitration of the alkyl-substituted phenylacetic acid followed by reduction of the nitro group, e.g. with tin(II) chloride and finally functionalization of the resulting amino group.<br>
The reaction can also be performed by a standard one-pot procedure, e.g. using a reductive amination of amines of formula II and aldehydes of formula IV. The aldehydes of formula<br><br>
IV are prepared by reduction of the before mentioned functionalized (aminophenyl)acetic acid by treatment with a reducing agent such as e.g. borane. The resulting alcohol is converted to the corresponding aldehyde by standard oxidation methods, e.g. pyridinium chlorochromate.<br>
The reduction of the double bond according to method 3) is generally performed by catalytic hydrogenation at low pressure (
The acylation according to method 4) is conveniently performed by standard methods via the carboxylic acid chloride, activated esters or by the use of carboxylic acids in combination with coupling reagents such as e.g. dicyclohexyl carbodiimide. When the acylation prodvices urea derivatives, the acylating reagent is carbamoyl chlorides, isocyanates or a two-step procedure consisting of treatment with phosgene followed by addition of an amine.<br>
The intermediate compounds of formula VI are prepared as described in methods 1) and 2).<br>
The derivatives of structure VII are prepared by means of a solid phase synthesis sequence as outlined below. The final product was cleaved from the resin according to method 5) using diluted sodium methoxide in a methanol/tetrahydrofuran mixture at ambient temperature. The first building block, VIII, prepared by tert-butoxycarbonyl protection of compounds of formula II, which is prepared by methods obvious to the chemist skilled in the art (see also EP-Al-465398), is generally attached to the resin (eg. polystyrene bound ethyl 4-nitrophenyl carbonate) using base e.g. N,N-dimethylaminopyridine and N^N-diisopropylethylamine at elevated temperature (e.g. 50-100 °C) in an aprotic solvent (e.g. DMF or DMSO). After deprotection of compound DC by trifluoroacetic acid, the second diversifying building block is introduced by alkylation of compoimd X whereby compound XI is formed. The alkylating reagent is prepared by nitration of alkylsubstituted .  phenylacetic acid by standard nitration procedures followed by reduction of the carboxylic acid, e.g. by treatment with borane in tetrahydrofurane and finally converting the produced alcohol  to   a   leaving  group,   e.g.  by  treatment  with  methanesulfonyl   chloride   in<br><br>
dichloromethane and triethylamine. The alkylation is performed at elevated temperature (50-100oC) in an aprotic solvent such as DX-IF, acetone or acetonitrile leading to resin XI. After reduction of the nitro group, e.g. by treatment with tin(II) chloride in DMF, the third diversifying building block is introduced by standard acylation procedures, e.g. addition oC an acid chloride, isocyanate or carbamoyl chloride and base at low temperature in DNEF, dichloromethane or acetonitrile.<br><br><br>
Experimental Section<br>
Melting points were determined on a Buchi SMP-20 apparatus and are uncorrected. Analytical LC-MS data were obtained on a PE Sciex API 150EX instrument equipped with IonSpray source and Shimadzu LC-SA/SLC-lOA LC system. The LC conditions (CIS column 4.6 x 30 mm with a particle size of 3.5μm) were linear gradient elution with water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (90:10:0.05) to water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (10:90:0.03) in 4 min at 2 mL/min. Purity was determined by integration of the UV trace (254 nm). The retention times, Rt, are expressed in minutes.<br>
Mass spectra were obtained by an alternating scan method to give molecular weight infomiation. The molecular ion, MH+, was obtained at low orifice voltage (5-20V) and fragmentation at high orifice voltage (100-200V).<br>
Preparative LC-MS-separation was performed on the same instrument. The LC conditions (CIS column 20 x 50 mm with a particle size of 5 μm) were linear gradient elution with water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (80:20:0.05) to water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (5:95:0.03) in 7 min at 22.7 mL/min. Fraction collection was performed by split-flow MS detection.<br>
'H NMR spectra were recorded at 500.13 MHz on a Bruker Avance DRX500 instrument or at 250.13 MHz on a Bruker AC 250 instrument. Deuterated chloroform (99.8%D) or dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9%D) were used as solvents. TMS was used as internal reference standard. Chemical shift values are expressed in ppm-values. The following abbreviations are used for multiplicity of NMR signals: s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, qui=quintet, h=heptet, dd=double doublet, dt=double triplet, dq=double quartet, tt=triplet of triplets, m=multiplet. NMR signals corresponding to acidic protons are generally omitted. Content of water in crystalline compounds was determined by Karl Fischer titration. For column chromatography silica gel of type Kieselgel 60,40-60 mesh ASTM was used. For ion-exchange chromatography (SCX, 1 g, Varian Mega Bond Elut®, Chrompack cat. no. 220776). Prior use of the SCX-columns was pre-conditioned with 10% solution of acetic •, acid in methanol (3 mL).<br><br>
