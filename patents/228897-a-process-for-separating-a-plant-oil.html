SEPARATION OF PLANT OIL TRIGLYCERIDE MIXTURES<br>
BY SOLID BED ADSORPTION<br>
This invention pertains to a solid bed adsorptive separation of triglyceride mixtures, specifically triglyceride mixtures obtamablefrom plant.oils.<br>
Triglyceride fatty acid esters derivedfrom plant oils, such as the oils of the castor, vemonia, and lesquorella plants, can provide a renewable source of non-petroleum-based chemical feedstocks. Unsaturated, long-chain fatty acid esters obtainablefrom castor oil, such as the glycerides of ricinoleic acid, for example, can be metathesized with lower olefins, such as ethylene, to produce reduced chain a-olefins, such as 4-hydroxy-l-decene, and reduced chain a-olefins having terminal ester functionalities, such as the terminal diglyceride and triglyceride esters of a-decenoate. The unsaturated ester can be oxidatively cleaved to producethe corresponding ct, a-unsaturated carboxylic acid. a-Olefims and ester or acid-fimctionalized a-olefins find utility as monomers in the manufacture of poly(olefins) and as chain ext^iders in thermoset resins. Alternatively, a-olefins can be converted into the corresponding a-epoxides, which also find utility in the manufacture of thermoset resins. In the case of triglycerides separatedfrom castor oil, the corresponding a-olefin metathesis products can be converted into diepoxides and triepoxides, which are highly usefiil in preparing epoxy resins.<br>
In order to obtain the benefit of plant oils as a renewable source of chemical feedstocks for the polymer industry, the plant oils must first be separated into substantially pure firactions of their component triglyceride fatty acid esters. In the past, solid bed adsorptive chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography have been employed to separate mixtures. Typically, these separation methods involve applying a dilute solution of a feed mixture to an adsorbent bed, and thereafi:er eluting a large quantity of desoibent material through the bed under desorptive conditions sufficient to separate the components of the feed mixture and recover a substantially pure stream of each component. To obtain a high degree of separation, the adsorbent is generally provided in a small particle size, typically less than about 30 microns (pm). When a small adsorbent particle size is employed in an industrial scale adsorptive bed, the small particles disadvantageously<br><br>
produce a significant pressure drop down the adsorbent bed, which can result in plugging, premature over-saturation of the upstream end of the bed, and flow problems. In another aspect of the prior art process, the dilute feed solution applied to the adsorbent typically contains from about 0.1 to about 10 percent feed mixture by volume, based on the total volume of feed mixture and solvent. Typically too, the volume ratio of desorbent to feed mixture is greater than about 1000/1. Accordingly, these traditional adsorptive bed processes require equipment designed to handle large quantities of liquid solvents and desorbents. The cost and complexity of such an operation are high, as compared with the quantity of extract recovered. Due to these inherent disadvantages, adsorptive bed methods for separating a feed mixture typically are conducted on a small analytical laboratory scale, but are not suitably employed for large industrial scale operations.<br>
US 4,770,819 discloses a process of separating diglycerides from triglycerides employing a lithium, potassium, or hydrogen ion exchanged omega zeolite or silica adsorbent It is taught that the diglyceride is selectively adsorbed to the substantial exclusion of the triglyceride. The adsorbent is disclosed to have a particle size ranging from about 16 to about 60 US mesh (from about 1,305 microns m) to about 250m). The process is also disclosed to be adaptable to a moving bed or simulated moving bed flow system, and to be adaptable to commercial scale units. US 4,770,819 is silent with regard to separating a mixture of triglycerides.<br>
In view of the above, it would be desirable to discover a solid bed adsorptive method for separating mixtures of triglycerides derived particularly from plant oils, such as castor, vemonia, and lesquerella plant oils. It would be more desirable if such a process did not require a small adsorbent particle size; but instead could provide an acceptable degree of separation with a large adsorbent particle size adaptable to industrial scale unit operations. It would be even more desirable if such a process employed relatively small quantities of solvent and desorbent as compared with prior art processes, which would have the effect of decreasing the size, complexity, and cost of the equipment required for the process. Finally, it would be most desirable, if the separation was efficient, so as to yield substantially pure fractions of the triglyceride components ofthe mixture. A solid bed adsorptive process having all of the aforementioned properties could be beneficially employed to obtain<br><br>
substantially pure fractions of useful fatty acid esters from plant oils, rendenng these oils a good source of renewable, non-petroleum-based chemical feedstocks.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides for a novel process of separating a mixture of triglyceride esters obtainable from plant oils. The process comprises contacting a seed oil, whose fatty acid composition is comprised predominantly of one principle fatty acid selected from ricinoleic, vemolic, and lesquerolic acids, at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent in a bed, the adsorbent having a particle size greater than about 40 microns. In the process of this invention, a first triglyceride product, characterized as having three fatty acids, each identical to the principle fatty acid in the oil, is adsorbed more selectively by the adsorbent, as compared with a second triglyceride product The second triglyceride product is characterized as having either of two, one, or no fetty acids identical to the principle fatty acid in the oil. The second triglyceride product is removed before the first triglyceride product by withdrawing from the adsorbent a raffinate stream comprising predominantly the second triglyceride product, after which a purified second triglyceride product may be obtained from the raffinate stream. After withdrawing the second triglyceride product, the first triglyceride product is desorbed. The desorption of the first triglyceride product is effected by contacting the adsorbent containing the first triglyceride product with a desotbent under desorbent conditions sufficient to yield an extract stream comprising predominantly the first triglyceride product and desotbent, from which a purified first triglyceride product may be obtained. The terms "desorbent," "raffinate stream," and "extract stream," as well as other technical terms used in cotmection with this invention, are defined and described in detail hereinafter.<br>
In the unique process of this invention, a seed oil comprising a mixture of triglyceride esters, obtainable, for example, from castor, vemonia, and lesquerella plants, is separated into two purified triglyceride fractions, Advantageously, the process of this invention employs a large adsorbent particle size, which allows the process to be used in industrial scale unit operations without an undesirable pressure drop down the adsorbent bed. More advantageously, in preferred embodiments the process of this invention applies a high concentration of feed oil to the adsorbent bed, which reduces the quantity of solvent<br><br>
needed when applying the feed to the bed. Even more advantageously, in a preferred embodiment targeted for industrial scale, the process of this invention may employ a minimal desorbent flow, as compared with prior art processes. The use of minimal solvent and minimal desorbent flow advantageously reduces the size of the equipment required, its cost, and the complexity of processing the liquid phases. All of the aforementioned advantages make the process of this invention more adaptable to industrial scale separations. Accordingly, the process described herein provides for an attractive method of obtaining purified triglycerides, useful in polymer applications, from plant oils, which are a renewable source of non-petroleum-based chemical feedstocks.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Jn the novel process of this invention, a seed oil comprising a mixture of triglycerides is separated by a solid bed adsoiptive method into two purified triglycmde fractions. The novel process comprises contacting a seed oil whose fatty acid composition comprises predominantly one princple fatty add sdected from vernolic and lesquerolic acids, at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent in a bed, the adsorbent having a particle size greater than about 40 microns. The term "predominantly" in this instance shall be taken to mean greater than about 50 weight percent, based on the total weight of fatty acids. In the process of this invention, a first triglyceride product (homogenous product), characterized as having three fatty acids each identical to the principle fatty acid in the oil, is selectively adsorbed as compared with a second triglyceride product. The second triglyceride product (heterogeneous product) is characterized as having either two, one, or no fatty acids identical to the principle fatty acid in the oil. In a preferred embodiment, the second triglyceride product is characterized as having two fatty acids identical to the<br><br>
principle fatty acid in the oil and a third fatty acid selected from any fatty acid in the oil exclusive of the principle fatty acid. In the process of this invention, the second triglyceride product is removed before the first triglyceride product by withdrawing from the adsorbent a raffinate stream comprising predominantly the second triglyceride product, as described hereinafter. The second triglyceride product may then be obtained in substantially pxn-e form from the raffinate stream, if desired. After withdrawing the raffinate stream, the first triglyceride product is desorbed by contacting the adsorbent containing the first triglyceride product with a desorbent under desorbent conditions sufficient to yield an extract stream comprising predominantly the first triglyceride product and desorbent, as described hereinafter. A substantially pure first triglyceride product may be obtained from the extract stream, if desired.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a seed oil having a fatty acid composition comprising greater than about 50 weight percent ricinoleic acid, obtainable from the seeds of castor plants, is separated by a solid bed adsorptive method into two substantially pure triglyceride fi-actions, these being triricinolein and diricinolein, Triricinolein is derived from three ricinoleic fatty acid molecules; whereas diricinolein is derived from two ricinoleic fatty acid molecules and a third fatty acid molecule selected from any fetty acid present in the castor oil exclusive of ricinoleic acid. In this preferred embodiment, the process comprises contacting the aforementioned seed oil obtainable from the castor plant at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent in a bed, the adsorbent having a particle size greater than about 40 microns. In this preferred embodimen it, triricinolein is selectively adsorbed as conpared with diricinolein. Accordingly, diricinolem is removed before triricinolein by withdrawing a raffinate stream comprising predominantly diricinolein from the adsorbent. The diricinolein may then be obtained in substantially pure form from the raffinate stream, if desired. After withdrawing the rafifinate stream, the triricinolein is desorbed by contacting the adsorbent containing the triricinolein with a desorbent under desorbent conditions sufficent to yield an extract stream comprising predominantly triricinolein and desorbent. A substantially pure triricinolein may be obtained from the extract stream, if desired.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment of this invention, the adsorbent has a particle size greater than about 70 pm (210 US mesh). In a more preferred embodiment, the adsorbent is silica having a particle size greater tlian about 70 |im (211 US mesh) and less than about 800 m (22 US mesh). In yet another preferred embodiment of this invention, the process is conducted in a moving bed or simulated moving bed flow system, as referenced hereinafter.<br>
As described hereinabove, this invention comprises the separation of a seed oil into triglyceride products. One product is a tri^yceride having three fatty acids identical to the principal fatty acid component of the seed oil. The second product is a triglyceride having either of two, one, or no fatty acids identical to the principle fatty acid component of the feed oil. In a preferred raabodiment, the second triglyceride product has two fatty acids identical to the principal fatty acid component of the seed oil and a third fatty acid selected from any fatty acid present in the seed oil exclusive of the principal fatty acid. In a related concept of this invention, the separation may likewise be effected when the second product is a triglyceride having only one fatty acid identical to the principal fatty acid component of the seed oil and two fatty acids each individually selected from fatty acids present in the seed oil exclusive of the principal fatty acid. In another related concept of this invention, the separation may likewise be effected when the second product is a triglyceride having three fatty acids each individually selected from any fatty acid jn-esent in the seed oil exclusive of the principal fatty add. In this alternative embodiment, the second triglyceride product contains none of the principal fatty acid. Hereinafter, the invention is described for &amp;e specific application involving separating a seed oil into a first triglyceride product having three fatty adds identical to the prindpal fatty add and a second triglyceride product having two fatty adds identical to the prindpal fatty acid and a third fatty add selected from any fatty acid present in the seed oil exclusive of the prindpal fatty add Based on the detailed description herein, one skilled in the art will easily recognize how to conduct the process of this invention so as to separate a first triglyceride product having three fatty adds identical to the prindpal fatty add and a second triglyceride product having only one prindpal fatty add or none of the prindpal fatty acid.<br>
The seed oil employed in the process of this invention may be any seed oil whose fatty add composition comprises predominantly one principle fatty add selected from<br><br>
ricinoleic, vemolic, and lesquerolic acids. As noted hereinbefore, the term "predominantly" in this instance means greater than about 50 weight percent of the principle fatty add. Preferably, the fatty acid composition of the seed oil comprises greater than about 70 weight percent of one principle fatty acid selected from ricinoleic, vemolic, and lesquerolic acids, and more preferably, greater than about 85 weight percent of one principle fatty acid selected from ricinoleic, vemolic, and lesquerolic acids. Typically, seed oils meeting this criterion include the seed oils obtained from the castor, vemonia, and lesquerella plants. These plants are cultivated and found naturally, particularly in tropical habitats in India and Africa. Any grade of such oils may be employed in title process of this invention, including crude oils as well as oils that have been refined, bleached, and/or deodorized.<br>
To be more specific, castor oil comprises a mixture of two types of triglycerides, each derived from the condensation of glycerol, a trihydric alcohol, with three fatty acids. In one of the triglyceride components "triricinolein," glycerol is esterified with three molecules of ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxy-cw-9-octadecenoic acid), in this instance the principle fatty acid. In the second triglyceride component "diricinolein," glycerol is esterified with two molecules of ricinoleic acid. The third hydroxyl functionality in diricinolein is esterified with any other fatty acid typically present in castor oil exclusive of ricinoleic acid. The third fatty acid is preferably selected from oleic and palmitic acids. A typical castor oil composition comprises the following: ricinoleic acid, from about 85 to about 90 percent; linolenic acid, from about 3 to about 5 percent; oleic acid, from about 2 to about 5 percent; palmitic acid, from about 1 to about 3 percent; stearic acid, from about 1 to about 2 percent; and dihydroxy stearic acid of about 1 percent (±0,3), by weight Castor oil is obtainable from the beans of the castor plant (Ricinus communis).<br>
Likewise, vemonia oil comprises a mixture of triglycerides derived from glycerol and fatty acids of the following typical composition by weight: vemolic add, from about 60 to about 77 percent; linolenic acid, from about 0.1 to about 0.4 percent; linoleic add, from about 9 to about 13 percent; oleic acid, from about 4 to about 20 percent and stearic add, from about 2 to about 4 perceat In vemonia oils, one triglyceride is derived from three vemolic acid molecules (12,13-epoxy-cis-9-octadecenoic add), in this instance the prindple fattv acid. A second tridvceride in vemonia oil contains two vemolic adds and a third fattv<br><br>
acid obtained from any of the other fatty acids present in vemonia oil exclusive of vemolic acid. Vemonia oil is obtainable from several plant species including, for example, Vemonia hymenolepsis, Vemonia galimensis, Stokesia lavis, and Euphorbia lagasae.<br>
In like manner, lesquerella oils comprise a mixture of triglycerides derived from glycerol and fatty acids having the following typical composition by weight: lesquerolic add, from about 10 to about 75 percent; linolenic add, from about 1 to about 13 percent; linoldc add, from about 3 to about 8 percent; oleic acid, from about 11 to about 27 percent; stearic add, from about 1 to about 6 percent and palmitic acid, from about 1 to about 6 percent More specifically, it is lesquerella oils containing greater than about 50 weight percent of lesquerolic acid that are used in the process of this invention. One triglyceride present in lesquerella oil is derived from three molecules of lesquerolic add (14-hydroxy-dsA 1 -dcosenoic add), that being the prindple add in this instance. The second triglycaide present in lesquerella oil contains two lesquerolic adds and a third fatty acid selected from any other fatty adds present in the oil exclusive of lesquerolic acid. Lesquerella oil is obtainable from several plant spedes including, for example, L densipilia and L. fendleri.<br>
In the following more detailed description of the invention, a variety of terms will be used, which for the sake of clarity are defined hereinafter. The term "feed mixture" shall indicate a seed oil which comprises a mixture of triglycerides from which at least one extract component and one raffinate component can be obtained, as noted hereinbelbw. As described hereinabove, the fatty add composition of the seed oil shall also comprise greater than about 50 wdght percent of one prindple fatty add selected from ridnoldc, vemolic, and lesquerolic adds. The tain "feedstream" shall indicate a stream comprising a seed oil that is passed to the adsorbent in this process. An "extract component shall refer to a component of the feed mixture that is more selectively adsorbed by the adsorbent; while a "raffinate component" shall refer to a component of the feed mixture that is less selectively adsorbed by flie adsorbent These definitions of extract and raffinate components are consistent with general chemical lexicography wherein an "extract" is defined as a solution that contains an extracted solute, and a "raffinate" is defined as a residual feed solution after one or more constituents have been ranoved by extraction. (Refer, for example, to<br><br>
iVt<br>
Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 5  ed., by Robert H. Perry, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1973, Chapter 15, p. 2.) Accordingly, in the process of this invention, the extract component is the first triglyceride product (homogeneous triglyceride), characterized as having three fatty acids identical to the principle fatty acid in the oil. In the process of this invention, the raffinate component is the second triglyceride product (heterogeneous triglyceride), preferably, characterized as having two fatty acids identical to the principle fatty acid in the oil and a third fatty acid selected from any of the other fatty acids in the oil exclusive of the principle fatty acid. The term "extract stream" shall rnean a stream through which the extract component, which has been desorbed, is removed from the adsorbent The term '^raffinate stream" shall mean a stream through which the raffinate component is removed from the adsorbent The term "desorbent material" shall generally refer to one or more liquid compounds that are capable of desorbing an extract component from the adsorbent The "desorbent input stream" indicates the stream through which the desorbent passes into the adsorbent Since the extract stream and raffinate stream will contain some quantities of desoibent material, it is typically the case that the extract and raffinate streams are individually subjected to a sepration means, such as fractional distillation, to remove the desorbent material and to obtain substantially pure fractions of triglycerides. Accordingly, the terms "extract product' and "raffinate product" shall refer to the products produced, herdn first and second triglyceride products, respectively, on removing the desorbent from the extract stream and the raffinate stream. Alternatively, the extract stream and raffinate stream may be employed directiy in downstream operations without removal of the desorbent and without isolation of the purified extract and raffinate products.<br>
In accordance with the process of this invention, the seed oil, comprising a mixture of triglycerides, can be applied to the adsorbent as a neat liquid. Alternatively, if desired, the oil can be applied in solution to the adsorbent If a solution is employed, then any solvent can be used, provided certain criteria are generally satisfied. To be specific, the solvent should be capable of dissolvingthe oil to form a homogenous solution. Also, the solvent should be substantially inert, that is, substantially non-reactive with any of the oil components. The solvent should also not interfere withthe separation method; for example, the solvent should not selectively bind to the adsorbent such that the solvent substantially blocks the adsorption of the extract component to the adsorbent Additionally, since it may<br><br>
be desirable for the solvent to be removed from the raffinate and extract streams, the solvent may be selected to be easily separable from the raffinate and extract streams by sunple conventional means, for example, by fractional distillation. Solvents that typically possess these properties include, without limitation, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, and octane, including the various isomers thereof; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene; chlorinated aliphatics and aromatics, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, and chlorobenzene; polar solvents, including alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, butanols, amyl alcohol, and glycols; esters, such as, ethyl acetate and butyl acetates; ethers, such as, the&amp;yl ether and diisopropyl ether; and ketones, such as, acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, and the like. Mixtures of any of the aforementioned solvents, preferably, mixtures of non-polar and polar solvents, can also be employed, and may be preferred, because fatty acid triglyceride esters have both non-polar and polar constituents. More preferably, the solvent is a mixture of a C1-10 aliphatic hydrocarbon and a C1-6 acetate, even more preferably, a mixture of n-hexane and ethyl acetate.<br>
If a mixture of solvents is used, then the relative quantities of solvents in the solvent mixture can be variable, so long as the solvent mixture possesses the attributes mentioned hereinbefore and functions to deliver the feed mixture to the adsorbent The actual quantities of solvent components used can vary depending upon the specific solvents and specific feed mixture employed. For example, in a two solvent system, the conc^itration of each solvent component may range from greater than about 0 to less than about 100 volume percent, and preferably, from greater than about 10 ta less than about 90 volmne i^rcent. One skilled in the art will know how to adjust the relative quantities of solvent components to optimize the solubility of the feed mixture therein. If a solvent or mixture of solvents is employed, then the concentration of the feed oil mixture in the solvent or solvent mixture can also vary widely, provided that the feed mixture is deUvered to the adsorbent as desired. Generally, the concentration of the feed mixture in the solvent or solvent mixture is greater than about 50 volume percent, based on the total volume of the feed mixture plus solvent(s). Preferably, the concentration of the feed mixture in the solvent or solvent mixture is greater than about 70 volume percent, more preferably, greater than about 90 volume percent, even<br><br>
more preferably, greater than about ys volume percent. In a most preterred emdoaiment, essentially no solvent is employed.<br>
The adsorbent employed in the process of this invention may comprise any known adsorbent material, provided that the separation of the triglyceride mixture described herein yields substantially pure triglyceride fractions. Non-limiting examples of suitable adsorbent materials include silicas, aluminas, silica-aluminas, clays, crystalline porous metallosilicates including, for example, molecular sieves, zeolites, and mesoporous aluminosilicates; as well as reticular synthetic polymeric resins, such as cross-linked polystyrenes, including for example, divinylbenzene cross-linked polystyrenes. These adsorbents are commonly obtainable from commercial sources. Preferably, the adsorbent is silica, more preferably, silica gel. In a preferred embodiment, the adsorbent is porous, which means that it contains channels, pores, or cavities that provide access to the feed mixture and desorfoent, and any solvent that may be used. Typically, the average pore size ofthe adsorbent is greater than about 45 Angstroms (A), and preferably, greater than about 55 A in diameter (or cross-sectional dimension in the case of a non-circular pore). Typically, the average pore size of<br>
a	o<br>
the adsorbent is less than about 500 A, and preferably, less than about 200 A in diameter (or cross-sectional dimension).<br>
The adsorbent used in the adsorptive separation process of this invention may be in the form of particles, such as spheres, aggregates, extrudates, tablets, granules, or other regular or irregular shapes and forms. Optionally, the adsorbent may be dispersed in a binder material or inorganic matrix ,for the purpose of agglomerating the adsorbent particles, which might otherwise be in a fine powder form. Additionally, the binder or matrix may strengthen the adsorbent particles. Refractory oxides, such as silica, alumina, or silica-alumina, may be suiitsbly employed as the binder or inorganic matrix. Preferably, the binder or matrix is also a porous material, that is, a material containing channels, pores, and/or cavities therein, whidi enable liquid access to Ihe adsorbent Suitable pore sizes for the binder generally range from greater than about 45 Angstroms to less than about 200 Angstroms in diameter (or cross-sectional dimension).<br><br>
with respect to particle size, it is commonly recognizea mat tne smaller ttie adsorbent particle size, the better will be the separation of the components of the mixture. A large particle size, in contrast, is generally considered to produce poorer separation results, Accordingly, adsorbent particles on the order of about 30 microns or less are typically employed for analytical scale separations. Disadvantageously, however, the smaller the adsorbent particle, the larger the pressure drop down the adsorbent bed. In the case of an industrial scale separation unit, a small particle size can produce a significant pressure drop down the adsorbent bed, thereby creating flow problems, such as xmeven flow rates, xmeven flow distribution, and plugging. Unexpectedly, it has now been discovered that good separation of the triglyceride components of seed oils can be achieved when the adsorbent possesses a large particle size. Accordingly, the process of this invention is beneficially adaptable to commercial scale separation units.<br>
With reference to the above, in the process of this invention the particle size of the adsorbent or the adsorbent-binder composite is typically greater than about 40 microns μm) (less than about 368 US mesh), preferably, greater than about 70 μm (less than about 211 US mesh), and more preferably, greater than about 100 μm (less than about 149 US mesh) in diameter (or critical dimension in the case of non-spherical particles). Typically, the particle size of the adsorbent or adsorbent-binder composite is less than about 800 μm (greater than about 22 US mesh), and preferably, less than about 600 pm (greater than about 30 US mesh). The use herein of a large particle size, of greater than about 40 μm, and preferably, greater than about 70 μm, renders the process of this invention more adaptable to industrial scale units.<br>
The desorbent material, which is used in the process of this invention, can be any fluid substance that is capable of removing the selectively adsorbed extract componentfrom the adsorbent In adsorptive separation processes, which are generally operated at substantially constant temperature and pressure that ensure liquid phase, the desorbent material relied upon is typically selected to satisfy several criteria. First, the desorbent material should be capable of displacing the extract component from the adsorbent with reasonable mass flow.rates without the desorbent itself being so strongly adsorbed as to prevent the extract component from substantially displacing the desorbent in the following<br><br>
adsorption cycle. Secondly, the desorbent material should be compatible with the particular adsorbent and the particular feed mixture. Specifically, the desorbent should be substantially non-reactive with either the adsorbent or any component of the feed mixture, and should not substantially reduce or destroy the selectivity of the adsorbent for the extract component with respect to the raffinate component. It may be further desirable for the desorbent material to be readily separable from the feed mixture. After desorbing the extract component of the feed, both desorbent material and the extract component are typically removed in admixture from the adsoibent Likewise, the raffinate component is typically withdrawn from the adsorbent in admixture with the desorbent material. If pure fractions of the extract and raffinate products are desired, then the desorbent material should be readily separated from the extract and raffinate components, for example, by simple fractional distiUation. In this case, the desorbent material may be selected to have a boiling point that renders the desorbent readily separable. It may be, however, that the extract and raffinate streams are to be used directly in other downstream operations, and that the extract and raffinate products are not to be removed from the desorbent immediately. If so, then other factors determined by the integrated separation and downstream operations may influence the choice of desorbent, as designed by one skilled in the art<br>
Desoibents that typically possess the aforementioned properties include, without limitation, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, heptane, hexane, cyclohexane, and octane, including the various isomers thereoi; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzae; chlorinated aliphatics and aromatics, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, and chlorobenzene; polarl-solvents, including alcohols ethanql, isopropanol, butanols, amyl alcohol, and glycols; esters, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetates; ethers, such as thethyl ether and diisopropyl ether, and ketones, such as acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone; and the like. Mixtures of any of the aforementioned desoibents, particularly mixtures of non-polar and polar desorbents, can also be employed, and may be preferred, since fatty acid esters have both non-polar and polar constituents. More preferably, the desorbent is a mixture of a CMO aliphatic hydrocarbon and C1-6 acetate ester, even more preferably, a mixture of n-hexane and ethyl acetate. In another preferred embodiment, the desorbent composition is identical to the solvent that is used to apply the feed mixture to the adsorbent<br><br>
If the desorbent is a mixture of liquids, then the relative quantities of each component of the desorbent mixture can vary, so long as the desorbent mixture fiinctions m a satisfactory marmer as described hereinabove. Generally, the relative amounts of each desorbent component will depend upon the specific desorbent components employed and their selectivities with respect to the specific extract and raffinate components. For example, in a two component desorbent mixture, the concentration of each component may be typically greater than 0, preferably, greater than about 10, and more preferably, greater than about 40 weight percent, based on the total weight of the first and second desorbent components. For example, in a two component desorbent mixture, the concentration of each component may be typically less than 100, preferably, less than about 90, and more preferably, less than about 60 weight percent, based on the total weight of the first and second desorbent components. One skilled in the art will know how to vary the relative quantities of components of any desorbent mixture to achieve the desired separation results.<br>
The concentration of the extract component in the extract stream comprising the extract component and the desorbent can vary widely fi'om nearly 0 volume percent extract component to typically about 65 volume percent extract component. Likewise, the concentration of the rafGnate component in the rafBnate stream can vary widely fiom nearly 0 volume percent rafGnate conponent to typically about 65 volume percent raffinate component It should be appreciated that an extract component is usually not completely adsorbed by the adsorbent, and a rafGnate component is usually not completely non-adsorbed by the adsorbent A<xordingiy a small quasitity of fiife rafgnate cctopofierit rnay be present in the extract stream and quantity component may raffinate as described hereinafter.></xordingiy>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, targeted for an industrial scale process, the desorbent material is employed in a minimal quantity, so as to reduce the volume of liquids required in the process. The term 'minimal quantity" shall mean that the ratio of the volume of desorbent to the volume of feed mixture is greater than about 0.5/1, but less than about 100/1 (as compared to greater than 1000/1 in analytical high pressure liquid<br><br>
chromatography (HPLC) methods). More preferably, the volume ratio of desorbent to feed mixture is less than about 10/1, and most preferably, less than about 2/1.<br>
Generally, the separation method of this invention operates under liquid phase conditions. The adsorbent may be provided in a bed, typically a fixed bed, which comprises a housing or chamber that contains the adsorbent. For the purposes of this invention, the term "bed" shall also generally include subsidiary valves, pumps, and conduits for maintaining the flows of the various liquid streams, as well as any other accessories or equipment needed to implement the process. The bed may be constructed in a vertical or horizontal direction, or if desired, inclined at an angle relative to vertical or horizontal. The adsorbent in the bed may be alternately contacted with the feed mixture and the desorbent material, in which case the process will only be semi-continuous. In another embodiment, a set ortwo or more static beds of adsorbent may be employed with appropriate valving so that the feed mixture can be passed through one or more adsorbent beds of a set, while the desorbent material is passed through one or more other beds of the set The flow of the feed mixture and the desorbent material may be either upwards or downwards through the adsorbent in such beds. Any conventional apparatus employed in static bed fluid-solid contacting may be used.<br>
Moving bed or simulated moving bed flow systems, however, have a separation efficiency greater than fixed bed adsorptive systems, and are therefore preferred. In the moving bed and simulated moving bed processes, the adsorption and desorption operations are continuously taking place, which allows for both contimuous productions of an exttact stream and a raffinate stream and the continual use of feed and desorbent streams. One preferred embodiment of this process utilizes what is known in the art as the simulating moving bed countercurrent flow system. In such a system, it is the progressive movement of multiple liquid access points down an adsorbent column that simulates the iq)ward movement of adsorbent contained in the column. The operating principles and sequence of such a flow system are described in D. B. Brougihton's US Patent 2,985,589. Another embodiment of a simulated moving bed flow system suitable for use in the process of this invention is the coccurrent high efficiency simulated moving bed process disclosed in US 4,402,832. Other moving bed flow systems, as blown in the art, may also be suitable.<br><br>
Adsorption conditions may vary over a wide range, provided that the separation of the triglyceride components of the oil is efifected as desired. Typically, the temperature will be maintained at greater than about 18°C. Typically,the temperature will be less than about 130°C, and preferably, less than about 75°C. Most preferably, the temperature will be about ambient, taken as about 21X. Usually, the pressure will be high enough to maintain liquid phase at the process temperature; but maintained at the minimum pressure necessary to obtain the desired flows in fee various zones for a given flow configuration of adsorbent columns. Typically, the pressure is equal to or greater than about 1 atm (101 kPa). Preferably, fee pressure will be less fean about 100 atm (10,118 kPa), more preferably, less fean about 50 atm (5,059 kPa). Desorption conditions include fee same ranges of temperature and pressure as are used for adsorption conditions. The flow rates of fee feed stream and desorbent stream will vary depending upon fee size of fee adsorbent unit, its design and operation, ani fee specific adsorbent and feed mixture employed. Flow rates can vary from as little as a few cm3 per hour up to many feousands of gallons per hour. The size of fee adsorption imits that can be adapted to fee process of this invention can vary anywhere from feose of laboratory scale to feose of pilot plant and commercial scale-When fee above-described seed oils, preferably, seed oils obtained from castor, vemonia, and lesquerella plants, are separated in accordance wife fee process of this invention, an extract stream and a raffinate stream are obtained, which are feen furfeer distinguished firm each ofeer and from fee feed mixture by fee ratio of fee concentrations of fee extract component and fee raffinate componrat appeariiig in each particular stream: This distinction is generally referred to as 'purity." More specifically, fee purity of fee extract component in fee extract stream is calculated as fee concentration of fee extract component in fee extract stream divided by fee sum of fee concentrations of fee extract and raffinate components in fee extract stream. Similarly, fee purity of fee raffinate component in fee raffinate stream is calculated as fee concitration of fee raffinate component in fee rafifinate stream divided by fee sum of fee concentrations of fee extract component and raffinate componaits in fee raffinate stream. Recall feat in this process, fee extract component is fee first triglyceride product preferably, triricinolein; and fee raffinate component is fee second triglyceride product, preferably, diricinolein Concentrations may<br><br>
be set forth in any common units, such as, grams per cubic centimeter (g/cmO or moles per liter (M). Altematively, one may take a ratio of extract and rafBnate concentrations as a measure of purity. For example, the ratio of the concentration of the more selectively adsorbed extract component to the concentration of the less selectively adsorbed raffinate component will be highest in the extract stream, next highest in the feedstream, and lowest in the raffinate stream. Likewise, the ratio of the less selectively adsorbed raffinate component to the more selectively adsorbed extract component will be highest in the raffinate stream, next highest in the feedstream, and lowest in Ihe extract stream.<br>
With reference to purity, the process of this invention achieves substantially pure fiuctions of two triglyceride products. In a preferred embodim^it of this invention, the purification of a castor seed oil yields substantially pure firactions of diricinolein and triricinolein. Typically, the purity of the first triglyceride product, preferably triricinolein, in the extract stream is greater than about 60 percent, preferably, greater than about 80 percent, more preferably, greats than about 95 percent, and most preferably, greater than about 99 percent, based on the concentrations of first and second triglyceride products in the extract stream. Likewise, the purity of the second triglyceride product, preferably, diricinolein, in the rafBnate stream is typically greater than about 60 percent, preferably, greater than about 80 percent, more preferably, greater than about 95 percent, and most preferably, greater than about 98 percent, based on the concentrations of the first and second triglyceride products in the rafBnate stream.<br>
If desired, the extract outputstream, or at least a portion of the extract output stream, comprising desoibent and the first triglyceride product, preferably triricinolein, may be passed into a separation means, wherein a least a portion ofthe desoibent material will be separated under separating conditions to produce an extract product containing a reduced quantity of desorbent Preferably, the concentration of desorbent in the extract product will be less than about 20 weight percent, more preferably, less than about 5 weight percent, and most preferably, less than about 0.5 weight percent, based on the weight of the extract product Optionally if desired, the raffinate output stream, or at least a portion of the raffinate output stream, comprising desorbent and the second triglyceride product, preferably diridnolein, may be passed mto a separation means, wherein at least a portion of<br><br>
the desorbent material will be separated under separating conditions to produce a raffinate product containing a reduced quantity of desorbent. Preferably, the concentration of desorbent in the raffinate product will be less than about 20 weight percent, more preferably, less than about 5 weight percent, and most preferably, less than about 0.5 weight percent, based on the weight of the raffinate product In each instance, the separation means will typically be a fractionation column, the design and operation of which are well known to those skilled in the art<br>
In order to tost various adsorbents and desorbents for the separation of seed oil triglyceride mixtures, a dynamic pulse testmg apparatus may be employed as described hereinafter. The apparatus may consist of a chamber, for example, of approximately 100 cm length by 1 cm ismet diameter, having inlet and outlet means at opposite ends of the chamber and filled with adsorbent material. The chamber is typically maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure; but means to maintain other temperatures and pressures may be employed as well. Generally, the chamber is equilibrated with the desorbent by passingthe desorbent material through the adsoibent chamber for sufficient time to effect equilibration. Thereafter, a pulse of feed mixture, optionally containing a solvent or desorbent material, is injected onto the top ofthe adsorbent column for a suitable time, for example, a time ranging from about 15 seconds to about 2 minutes. After the feed mixture is loaded onto the adsorbent, desorbent flow is resumed, and the triglyceride components are eluted as in liquid-solid chromatogr^hy. The raffinate and extract streams can be analyzed by high-pressure liquid phase chromatography or by any other suitable means, for example, refractive index. The analysis can be made continuously on-line or incrementally by collecting aliquots of the output Traces of the analysis as a function of lime are typically developed. After the components of the oil are essentially completely eluted from the absoibent bed, a second pulse of feed mixture can be applied; and the pulse cycle can be repeated as often as desired.<br>

Example 1<br>
An absorbent column was prepared by packing two glass, water jacketed columns (1 cm inner diameter by 50 cm length each), connected in series with a total length of 100 cm, with a commercial silica (Aldrich, 100-200 U.S. mesh, 150-75 micron particle SXZQ range, 60 Angstrom pore size). No water was flowing through the water jackets. The column was maintained at room temperature throughout the exporment A 0.5 ml/min flow of desorbent input stream, consisting of 50 weight percent ethyl acetate and 50 weight percent n-hexane, was established through the column from top to bottom by means of a pump. After desorbent flow was established for about 30 min, the flow was stopped and replaced with a feed stream consisting of castor oil (100 percent) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The castor oil flow was maintained for about 45 sec, which resulted in a loading of 0.375 ml of castor oil onto the top of the adsorbent bed Then, the flow of castor oil was stopped, and the flow of desorbent input stream was re-established. Throughout the process, the pressure at the outlet of the column was essentially atmospheric. The pressure at the inlet of the column was not controlled; but since the flow rate was slow,the pressure at the inlet was not expected to be significanfly above atmospheric. The desorbent output stream obtained from the bottom of the column was analyzed as a function of time by passing the desorbent output stream through a refractive index detector for qualitative analysis of the products and for determination of the degree of separation obtained. A first peak eiuting from the colunm was taken as the rafionate output stream; a second peak eiuting from the column was taken as the extract output stream- When the output stream showed that essentially all of the components of the first injection of cannot oil had eluted flu-ough the adsorbent bed, the pulse sequence was repeated with a second loading of castor oil and a second desorbent operation. The sequence was repeated for a total of six pulses.<br>
Figure 1 shows the refiractive index detector output for the six pulses, described hereinabove. In Figure 1the units for refractive index response and for time are simply given in arbitrary units (au) of increasing value along the two axes. The existence of two peaks in the detector trace indicates the separation of the castor oil feed into its two triglyceride components. The similarity in the traces of the six runs illustrates the reproducibility of the separation. Figure 2 shows in higher detail the refiractive index<br><br>
detector output from the fourth injection. Again, the units along the refractive index and time axes are arbitrary units of increasing value. Multiple fractions of the fourth injection were collected throughout the pulse. Cut #1 and Cut #6, shown in Figure 2, were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography for diricinolein and triricinolein. Cut #1 (analogous to raffinate stream) was found to contain essentially diricinolein (6,128 mg/liter) with only a small amount of triricinolein (51 mg/liter). Accordingly, the diricinolein fraction had a purity of greater than 99.0 weight percent. Cut #2 (analogous to extract stream) was found to contain essentially triricinolein (11,220 mg/liter) Avith only a small trace of diricinolein (17 mg/liter). The triricinolein fraction had a purity of greater than 99.8 weight percent.<br><br><br><br><br>
