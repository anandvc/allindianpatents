CKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0006]  This invention relates generally to methods of making soybean plants that produce soybean seed with altered oil compositions and, more particularly, to methods where soybean seed with a mid oleic, low linolenic phenotype or soybean seed with a mid oleic, low saturate, low linolenic phenotype are produced.<br>
2.	Related Art<br>
[0007]  Plant oils are used in a variety of applications. Novel vegetable oil compositions and improved approaches to obtain oil compositions, from biosynthetic or natural plant sources, are needed. Depending upon the intended oil use, various different fatty acid compositions are desired. Plants, especially species which synthesize large amounts of oils in seeds, are an important source of oils both for edible and industrial uses. Seed oils are composed almost entirely of triacytglycerols in which fatty acids are esterified to the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. [0008]  Soybean oil typically contains about 16-20% saturated fatty acids: 13-16% palmitate and 3-4% stearate. See generally Gunstone et al., The Lipid Handbook, Chapman &amp; Hall, London (1994). Soybean oils have been modified by various breeding methods to create benefits for specific markets. However, a soybean oil that is broadly beneficial to major soybean oil users such as consumers of salad oil, cooking oil and frying oil, and industrial markets such as biodiesel and biolube markets, is not available. Prior soybean oils were either too expensive or lacked an important food quality property such as oxidative stability, good fried food flavor or saturated fat content, or an important biodiesel property such as appropriate nitric oxide emissions or cold tolerance or cold flow.<br>
0009]  Higher plants synthesize fatty acids via a common metabolic pathway â€” the fatty acid synthetase (FAS) pathway, which is located in the plastids. p-ketoacyl-ACP synthases are important rate-limiting enzymes in the FAS of plant cells and exist in several versions. p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I catalyzes chain elongation to palmitoyl-ACP (C16:0), whereas p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II catalyzes chain elongation to stearoyl-ACP (C18:0). p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV is a variant of p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, and can also catalyze chain elongation to 18:0-ACP. In soybean, the major products of FAS are 16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP. The desaturation of 18:0-ACP to form 18:1-ACP is catalyzed by a plastid-localized soluble delta-9 desaturase (also referred to as "stearoyl-ACP desaturase"). See Voelker et al., 52 Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 335-61 (2001).<br>
[0010] The products of the plastidia! FAS and delta-9 desaturase, 16:0-ACP, 18:0-ACP, and 18:1-ACP, are hydrolyzed by specific thioesterases (FAT). Plant thioesterases can be classified into two gene families based on sequence homology and substrate preference. The first family, FATA, includes long chain acyl-ACP thioesterases having activity primarily on 18:1-ACP. Enzymes of the second family, FATB, commonly utilize 16:0-ACP (palmitoyl-ACP), 18:0-ACP (stearoyl-ACP), and 18:1-ACP (oleoyl-ACP). Such thioesterases have an important role in determining chain length during de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in plants, and thus these enzymes are useful in the provision of various modifications of fatty acyl compositions, particularly with respect to the relative proportions of various fatty acyl groups that are present in seed storage oils.<br>
[0011] The products of the FATA and FATB reactions, the free fatty acids, leave the plastids and are converted to their respective acyl-CoA esters. Acyl-CoAs are substrates for the lipid-biosynthesis pathway (Kennedy Pathway), which is located in<br>
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is responsible for membrane lipid formation as well as the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols, which constitute the seed oil. In the ER there are additional membrane-bound desaturases, which can further desaturate 18:1 to polyunsaturated fatty acids. A delta-12 desaturase (FAD2) catalyzes the insertion of a double bond into 18:1 (oleic acid), forming linoleic acid (18:2). A delta-15 desaturase (FAD3) catalyzes the insertion of a double bond into 18:2, forming linolenic acid (18:3).<br>
[0012]  Inhibition of the endogenous FAD2 gene through use of transgenes that inhibit the expression of FAD2 has been shown to confer a desirable mid-oleic acid (18:1) phenotype (i.e. soybean seed comprising about 50% and 75% oleic acid by weight). Transgenes and transgenic plants that provide for inhibition of the endogenous FAD2 gene expression and a mid-oleic phenotype are disclosed in U.S. Patent 7,067,722. In contrast, wild type soybean plants that lack FAD2 inhibiting transgenes typically produce seed with oleic acid compositions of less than 20%. [0013]  Soybean oil typically contains about 8% of linolenic acid (18:3) that results in reduced stability and flavor. The levels of linolenic acid (18:3) in soybean oil can be reduced by hydrogenation to improve both stability and flavor (Dutton et al., 1951; Lui and White, 1992). Unfortunately, hydrogenation results in the production of trans fatty acids, which increases the risk for coronary heart disease when consumed (Hu etal., 1997).<br>
[0014]  Conventional breeding has also been used to generate soybean lines with the linolenic levels ranging from 1%-6% ( Ross et al. Crop Science, 40.383; 2000; Wilson et al J. Oleo Sci., 50:5, 87, 2001; Wilson Lipid technology Sept. 1999). Varieties of low linolenic acid soybean have been produced through mutation, screening and breeding (Fehr et al., 1992; Rahman and Takagi, 1997; Ross et al.,<br>
2000; Byrum et al., 1997; Stoisin et al., 1998). Certain soybean varieties with a linolenic acid content of about 1% or lower have been obtained (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,534,425 and 5,714,670). More recently, methods for obtaining soybean plants with both low levels of linolenic acid levels as well as the yield and growth characteristics of agronomically elite soybean varieties have been disclosed (U.S. Patent Application 2006/0107348).<br>
[0015]  Oleic acid has one double bond, but is still relatively stable at high temperatures, and oils with high levels of oleic acid are suitable for cooking and other processes where heating is required. Recently, increased consumption of high oleic oils has been recommended, because oleic acid appears to lower blood levels of low density lipoproteins ("LDLs") without affecting levels of high density lipoproteins ("HDLs"). However, some limitation of oleic acid levels is desirable, because when oleic acid is degraded at high temperatures, it creates negative flavor compounds and diminishes the positive flavors created by the oxidation of linoleic acid. Neff etal., JAOCS, 77 :1303-1313 (2000); Warner etal., J. Agric. Food Chem. 49:899-905 (2001). It is thus preferable to use oils with oleic acid levels that are 65-85% or less by weight, in order to limit off-flavors in food applications such as frying oil and fried food. Other preferred oils have oleic acid levels that are greater than 55% by weight in order to improve oxidative stability.<br>
[0016]  For many oil applications, saturated fatty acid levels of less than 8% by weight or even less than about 2-3% by weight are desirable. Saturated fatty acids have high melting points which are undesirable in many applications. When used as a feedstock or fuel, saturated fatty acids cause clouding at low temperatures, and confer poor cold flow properties such as pour points and cold filter plugging points to the fuel. Oil products containing low saturated fatty acid levels may be preferred by<br>
consumers and the food industry because they are perceived as healthier and/or may be labeled as "saturated fat free" in accordance with FDA guidelines. In addition, low saturate oils reduce or eliminate the need to winterize the oil for food applications such as salad oils. In biodiesel and lubricant applications oils with low saturated fatty acid levels confer improved cold flow properties and do not cloud at low temperatures.<br>
[0017]  Soybean lines that produce seed with mid-oleic, low-linoleic acid content would be very desirable. Unfortunately, attempts to combine the mid oleic and low Iinolenic traits via genetic engineering approaches have been problematic. Transgenic lines where both the delta-12 desaturase (FAD2) and the delta-15 desaturase (FAD3) genes have been suppressed have seed with low Iinolenic levels, but the oleic acid levels are typically above the range defined for mid oleic. However, the methods disclosed here enable production of low Iinolenic soybean seeds that also have oleic acid levels in the mid oleic range of 55-80%. Furthermore, these methods do not entail hydrogenation processes and thus avoid the production of undesirable trans-fats.<br>
Soybean lines that produce seed with mid-oleic, low saturate, low-linoleic acid content would be also very desirable. Methods disclosed here enable production of low Iinolenic soybean seeds that also have oleic acid levels in the mid oleic range of 55-80% and saturated fatty acid levels of less than 8%.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]  It is in view of the above problems that the present invention was developed. The invention first relates to a method of producing a soybean plant comprising a Iinolenic acid content of less than about 6% of total seed fatty acids by weight and an<br>
oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight. This method of the invention is practiced by a first step of making one or more soybean plants that comprise a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene, a second step of obtaining at least one seed from said soybean plant obtained from the first step, a third step of determining a percentage of the total seed fatty acid content by weight of Iinolenic acid and oleic acid for the seed from the second step, and then identifying a soybean plant that yields seed having a seed fatty acid composition comprising a Iinolenic acid content of less than about 6% of total seed fatty acids by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight. [0019]  In other embodiments of this method, the soybean plants that are made in the first step comprise at least two loss of function mutations in at least two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes. These loss of function mutations can be located in the endogenous soybean FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C genes. In this embodiment of the method, the soybean plants identified in the third step of the method comprise a Iinolenic acid content of less than about 3% of total seed fatty acids by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight. [0020]  In certain embodiments of this method, the transgene can further comprise a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance. The herbicide tolerance transgene may confer tolerance to glyphosate. In specific embodiments of the invention, the transgene comprises sequences located between the T-DNA border sequences of pMON68504, pCGN5469, pCGN5471, or pCGN5485 that are integrated into a chromosome of said plant.<br>
[0021]    In the third step of the method, the percentage of the total seed fatty acid content by weight of linolenic acid and oleic acid is determined by a lipid analysis technique. This lipid analysis technique comprises one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of gas chromatography/flame ionization detection, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography/flame ionization detection, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization- mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy. [0022] The soybean plant comprising a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene can be made by crossing a first soybean parent line comprising the transgene with a second soybean parent line comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene to obtain an F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for the transgene and heterozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene and then selfing F1 progeny plants from the cross to obtain an F2 soybean plant that is homozygous for said transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene. In certain embodiments of this method, the second soybean parent line comprises at least two loss of function mutations in at least two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes. The two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes can be FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C. In this method, the F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for the transgene and for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene is obtained in step (i) by subjecting a plurality of F1 plants to at least one DNA analysis technique permitting identification of an F1 plant that is heterozygous for said transgene and for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene. Similarly, the F2 soybean plant that is<br>
 <br>
homozygous for the transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene is obtained in step (ii) by subjecting a plurality of F2 plants to at least one DNA analysis technique permitting identification of an F2 plant that is homozygous for said transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene. The DNA analysis technique comprises one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of PCR analysis, quantitative PCR analysis, SNP analysis, AFLP analysis, RFLP analysis and RAPD analysis. In certain embodiments of this invention, the DNA analysis technique comprises detection of at least one single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1C gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 687, 1129, 1203, 2316, 3292, 3360 or 3743 of SEQ ID NO'62, detection of a deletion in the FAD3-1C gene of SEQ ID NO:62, or detection of at least one single nucleotide polymorphism in a soybean FAD3-1C promoter sequence corresponding to a guanine at nucleotide 334, a cytosine at nucleotide 364, a thymine at nucleotide 385, an adenine at nucleotide 387, a cytosine at nucleotide 393, a guanine at nucleotide 729 and a cytosine at nucleotide 747 of SEQ ID NO:63. In other embodiments of this invention, the DNA analysis technique comprises detection of a single nucleotide polymorphism in a soybean FAD3-1B gene comprising a substitution of a thymine residue for a cytosine residue at a position in the FAD3-1b gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61. In this method, the transgene can further comprise a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance and the F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for said transgene is obtained in step (i) by subjecting a plurality of F1 plants to herbicide selection for said transgene. Similarly, when the transgene further comprises a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance, a plurality of F2 plants enriched for F2 soybean plants that are homozygous for said transgene are<br>
 <br>
obtained in step (ii) by subjecting said plurality of F2 plants to herbicide selection for said transgene. This method can also further comprise the step iii) of selfing the F2 progeny plant that are homozygous for the transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene from step (ii) to obtain an F3 soybean plant.<br>
[0023] An alternative method of making soybean plants that comprise a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene involves direct transformation of soybean plants or cells comprising the mutation with the transgene. Thus this soybean plant is made in the first step of the invention by transforming a soybean plant or plant cell comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene with a transgene that decreases the expression of endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene to obtain an R0 soybean plant with least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene that is heterozygous for said transgene, selfing the R0 progeny plant from the previous step to obtain an R1 soybean plant that is homozygous for the transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene, thereby obtaining a soybean plant comprising a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene. In certain embodiments of this method, the transgene further comprises sequences that confer a herbicide tolerance trait. In other embodiments of the invention, the transgene further comprises sequences that confer glyphosate tolerance. [0024] This invention also encompasses soybean plants produced by the aforementioned methods of the invention as well as plant parts of soybean plants produced by the methods of the invention. The soybean plant part produced can be<br>
pollen, an ovule, a meristem, a leaf, a stem, a root, or a cell. Progeny soybean plants from the soybean plants produced by these methods are also contemplated by this invention. The invention also encompasses seed of the soybean plant produced by the methods of the invention, where this seed has a fatty acid composition comprising a linolenic acid content of less than about 6% of total seed fatty acids by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight. The invention further encompasses seed of the soybean plant produced by methods wherein soybean plants comprising at least two loss of function mutations in at least two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes are used, said seed having a fatty acid composition comprising a linolenic acid content of less than about 3% of total seed fatty acids by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight.<br>
[0025] This invention also provides a method of obtaining a soybean plant with an altered seed oil fatty acid composition comprising the steps of: a) crossing a first soybean parent line having a seed oil fatty acid composition comprising a linolenic acid content of less than about 3% of total fatty acids by weight with a second soybean parent line having a seed oil fatty acid composition wherein the content of at least one fatty acid other than linoleic acid is altered by at least 50% when compared to the corresponding fatty acid content of a commodity soybean oil, said second soybean parent line comprising a transgene that alters the content of at least one fatty acid other than linoleic acid; and b) obtaining a progeny plant exhibiting a seed oil fatty acid composition comprising a linolenic acid content of less than 3% of total fatty acids by weight and a content of at least one fatty acid other than linoleic acid that is altered by at least 50% when compared to the corresponding fatty acid content of a commodity soybean oil, thereby obtaining a soybean plant with an<br>
altered seed oil fatty acid composition. In this method, the fatty acid other than linolenic acid is selected from the group consisting of lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, stearidonic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, y-linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.<br>
[0026] The invention also relates to a method of producing a soybean plant comprising a linolenic acid content of less than about 6% of total seed fatty acids by weight, a saturated fatty acid content of less than about 8% by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight. This method of the invention is practiced by a first step of making one or more soybean plants that comprise at least one transgene that decreases the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous FATB gene, and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene, a second step of obtaining at least one seed from said soybean plant obtained from the first step, a third step of determining a percentage of the total seed fatty acid content by weight of linolenic acid, saturated fatty acids and oleic acid for the seed from the second step, and then identifying a soybean plant that yields seed having a seed fatty acid composition comprising a linolenic acid content of less than about 6% of total seed fatty acids by weight, a saturated fatty acid content of less than about 8% by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight.<br>
[0027]  In other embodiments of this method, the soybean plants that are made in the first step comprise at least two loss of function mutations in at least two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes. These loss of function mutations can be located in the endogenous soybean FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C genes. In this embodiment of the method, the soybean plants identified in the third step of the method can<br>
comprise a linolenic acid content of less than about 3% of total seed fatty acids by weight, a saturated fatty acid content of less than about 8% by weight and an oleic acid content of about 55% to about 80% of total seed fatty acids by weight. [0028]  In certain embodiments of this method, the transgene can further comprise a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance. The transgene can confer tolerance to glyphosate. The transgene that confers resistance to glyphosate can encode a CP4 EPSPS gene.<br>
[0029]  In the third step of the method, the percentage of the total seed fatty acid content by weight of linolenic acid, saturated fatty acids and oleic acid is determined by a lipid analysis technique. This lipid analysis technique comprises one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of gas chromatography/flame ionization detection, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography/flame ionization detection, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization- mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy. [0030]  The soybean plant comprising at least one transgene that decreases the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous FATB gene and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene can be made by crossing a first soybean parent line comprising the transgene with a second soybean parent line comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene to obtain an F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for the transgene(s) and heterozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene and then setting F1 progeny plants from the cross to obtain an F2 soybean plant that is homozygous for said transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene. In certain embodiments of this<br>
method, the second soybean parent line comprises at least two loss of function mutations in at least two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes. The two endogenous soybean FAD3 genes can be FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C. In this method, the F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for the transgene and for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene is obtained in step (i) by subjecting a plurality of F1 plants to at least one DNA analysis technique permitting identification of an F1 plant that is heterozygous for said transgene and for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene. Similarly, the F2 soybean plant that is homozygous for the transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene is obtained in step (ii) by subjecting a plurality of F2 plants to at least one DNA analysis technique permitting identification of an F2 plant that is homozygous for said transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene. The DNA analysis technique comprises one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of PCR analysis, quantitative PCR analysis, SNP analysis, AFLP analysis, RFLP analysis and RAPD analysis. In certain embodiments of this invention, the DNA analysis technique comprises detection of at least one single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1C gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 687, 1129, 1203, 2316, 3292, 3360 or 3743 of SEQ ID NO:62, detection of a deletion in the FAD3-1C gene of SEQ ID NO:62, or detection of at least one single nucleotide polymorphism in a soybean FAD3-1C promoter sequence corresponding to a guanine at nucleotide 334, a cytosine at nucleotide 364, a thymine at nucleotide 385, an adenine at nucleotide 387, a cytosine at nucleotide 393, a guanine at nucleotide 729 and a cytosine at nucleotide 747 of SEQ ID NO:63. In other embodiments of this invention, the DNA analysis technique comprises detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in a soybean FAD3-1B gene<br>

In this method, the transgene can further comprise a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance and the F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for said transgene is obtained in step (i) by subjecting a plurality of F1 plants to herbicide selection for said transgene. Similarly, when the transgene further comprises a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance, a plurality of F2 plants enriched for F2 soybean plants that are homozygous for said transgene are obtained in step (ii) by subjecting said plurality of F2 plants to herbicide selection for said transgene. This method can also further comprise the step iii) of selfing the F2 progeny plant that are homozygous for the transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene from step (ii) to obtain an F3 soybean plant.<br>

Thus this soybean plant is made in the first step of the invention by transforming a soybean plant or plant ceil comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation (n an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene with one or more transgene(s) that decrease the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous soybean FATB gene to obtain an R0 soybean plant with least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene that is heterozygous for said transgene, selfing the R0 progeny plant from the previous step to obtain an R1 soybean plant that is homozygous for the transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function<br>
mutation in a FAD3 gene, thereby obtaining a soybean plant comprising a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene and at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene. In certain embodiments of this method, the transgene further comprises sequences that confer a herbicide tolerance trait. In other embodiments of the invention, the transgene further comprises sequences that confer glyphosate tolerance.

[00116] A "loss-of-function mutation" is a mutation in the coding sequence of a gene,<br>
which causes the function of the gene product, usually a protein, to be either<br>
reduced or completely absent. A loss-of-function mutation can, for instance, be<br>
caused by the truncation of the gene product because of a frameshift or nonsense<br>
mutation. A phenotype associated with an allele with a loss of function mutation can<br>
be either recessive or dominant.<br>
[00117] A cell or organism can have a family of more than one gene encoding a particular enzyme, and the capital letter that follows the gene terminology (A, B, C) is used to designate the family member, i.e., FAD2-1A is a different gene family member from FAD2-1B. Similarly, FAD3-1A, FAD3-1B, and FAD3-1C represent distinct members of the FAD3-1 gene family. Loss of function alleles of various genes are represented in lowercase followed by a minus sign (i.e. fad3-1b- and fad3-1c- represent loss of function alleles of the FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C genes, respectively).<br>
[00118] As used herein, any range set forth is inclusive of the end points of the range unless otherwise stated.<br>
[00119] A. Transgenes that decrease the expression of the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene<br>
[00120] Various transgenes that decrease the expression of the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene can be used to practice the methods of the invention. By suppressing, at least partially reducing, reducing, substantially reducing, or effectively eliminating the expression of the endogenous FAD2 gene, the amount of FAD2 protein available in a plant cell is decreased, i e the steady-state levels of the FAD2 protein are reduced. Thus, a decrease in expression of FAD2 protein in the soybean cell can result in an increased proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (C18:1). Soybean plants that contain transgenes that decrease the expression of the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and produce seed with increased oleic acid are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,067,722.<br>
[00121] Various transgenes that decrease the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous soybean FATB gene can be used to practice the methods of the invention for production of soybean plants with a low linolenic,<br>
low saturate, mid-oleic acid phenotype. By suppressing, at least partially reducing, reducing, substantially reducing, or effectively eliminating the expression of the endogenous FATB gene, the amount of FATB protein available in a plant cell is decreased, i.e. the steady-state levels of the FATB protein are reduced. When the amount of FATB is decreased in a plant cell, a decreased amount of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate and stearate can be provided. Thus, a decrease of FATB can result in an increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (18:1). [00122] Various methods for decreasing expression of either: 1) the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene(s) or 2) both the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and FATB gene(s) in soybean plants and seed are contemplated by this invention, including, but not limited to, antisense suppression, co-suppression, ribozymes, combinations of sense and antisense (double-stranded RNAi), promoter silencing, and use of DNA binding proteins such as zinc finger proteins. The general practice of these methods with respect to various endogenous plant genes is described in WO 98/53083, WO 01/14538, and U.S. Patent 5,759,829. Suppression of gene expression in plants, also known as gene silencing, occurs at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level. Certain of these gene silencing mechanisms are associated with nucleic acid homology at the DNA or RNA level. Such homology refers to similarity in DNA or protein sequences within the same species or among different species. Gene silencing occurs if the DNA sequence introduced to a host cell is sufficiently homologous to an endogenous gene that transcription of the introduced DNA sequence will induce transcriptional or post transcriptional gene silencing of the endogenous gene, To practice this invention, DNA sequences with at least 50%, about 60%, or about 70% identical over the entire length of a DNA sequence of a soybean FAD2-1 or FATB coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid<br>
sequence that is complementary to a soybean FAD2-1 or FATB coding or non-coding region, have sufficient homology for suppression of steady state expression levels of FAD2-1 or FATB when introduced into soybean plants as transgenes. The transgenes of the invention more preferably comprise DNA sequences that are, over their entire length, at least 80% identical; at least 85% identical; at least 90% identical; at least 95% identical; at least 97% identical; at least 98% identical; at least 99% identical; or 100% identical to a soybean FAD2-1 or FATB gene coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a soybean FAD2-1 or FATB gene coding or non-coding region. The DNA sequences with the above indicated levels of identity to the soybean FAD2-1 or FAT gene(s) may be coding sequences, intron sequences, 3'UTR sequences, 5'UTR sequences, promoter sequences, other non-coding sequences, or any combination of the foregoing. The intron may be located between exons, or located within a 5' or 3' UTR of a plant gene. The coding sequence is preferably a fraction of a protein encoding frame that does not encode a protein with FAD2 enzymatic activity. However, it is recognized that in certain instances, such as in cosuppression, DNA sequences that encode an enzymatically active FAD2 or FATB protein can be used to decrease expression of the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 or FATB gene(s). [00123]. It is also understood that DNA sequences with the above indicated levels of identity to the soybean FAD2-1 gene that are useful in the methods of this invention can be derived from any soybean FAD2 gene, the soybean FAD2-1A gene (SEQ ID NO:4 ), the soybean FAD2-1A intron (SEQ ID NO:1), Soybean FAD2-1B introns (SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:3), the soybean FAD2-2 gene, alleles of the soybean FAD2-1 gene , alleles of the soybean FAD2-2 gene, and from FAD2 genes derived from other leguminous plants such as Medicago sp., Pisum sp., Vicia sp., Phaseolus<br>
sp., and Pisum sp. It is thus clear that the DNA sequence with the indicated levels of identity to the soybean FAD2-1 sequence can be derived from multiple sources. DNA sequences with the indicated levels of sequence identity can also be obtained synthetically.<br>
[00124] Similarly, it is also understood that DNA sequences with the above indicated levels of identity to the soybean FATB gene that are useful in the methods of this invention can be derived from any soybean FATB gene, a soybean FATB-1 gene (SEQ ID NO:28), soybean FATB-1 introns (SEQ ID NO:29-35), soybean FATB-1 5'UTR (SEQ ID NO:36), soybean FATB-1 3'UTR (SEQ ID NO:37), the soybean FATB-2 gene (SEQ ID NO:43), alleles of the soybean FATB-1, alleles of the soybean FATB-2 gene, and from FATB genes derived from other leguminous plants such as Medtcago sp., Pisum sp., Vicia sp., Phaseolus sp., and Pisum sp. It is thus clear that the DNA sequence with the indicated levels of identity to the soybean FAD2-1 sequence can be derived from multiple sources. DNA sequences with the indicated levels of sequence identity can also be obtained synthetically. [00125] In the methods of this invention, transgenes specifically designed to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules with homology to the FAD2-1 gene can also induce FAD2-1 sequence-specific silencing and be used to decrease expression of the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene. The sense strand sequences of the dsRNA can be separated from the antisense sequences by a spacer sequence, preferably one that promotes the formation of a dsRNA molecule. Examples of such spacer sequences include those set forth in Wesley et al., Plant J., 27(6):581-90 (2001), and Hamilton et al., Plant J., 15:737-746 (1988). In a preferred aspect, the spacer sequence is capable of forming a hairpin structure as illustrated in Wesley et al., supra. Particularly preferred spacer sequences in this context are<br>
plant introns or parts thereof. A particularly preferred plant intron is a spliceable intron. Spliceable introns include, but are not limited to, an intron selected from the group consisting of PDK intron, FAD3-1A or FAD3-1B intron #5, FAD3 intron #1, FAD3 intron #3A, FAD3 intron #3B, FAD3 intron #3C, FAD3 intron #4, FAD3 intron #5, FAD2 intron #1, and FAD2-2 intron. The sense-oriented, non-coding molecules may be, optionally separated from the corresponding antisense-oriented molecules by a spacer segment of DNA. The spacer segment can be a gene fragment or artificial DNA. The spacer segment can be short to facilitate forming hairpin dsRNA or long to facilitate dsRNA without a hairpin structure. The spacer can be provided by extending the length of one of the sense or antisense molecules as disclosed in US 2005/0176670 A1. Alternatively, a right-border-right-border ("RB-RB") sequence can be created after insertion into the plant genome as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2005/0183170.<br>
[00126] The transgenes of the invention will typically include a promoter functional in a plant cell, or a plant promoter, that is operably linked to an aforementioned DNA sequence that decreases expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 or FATB gene. Design of such a vector is generally within the skill of the art (See, e.g., Plant Molecular Biology: A Laboratory Manual, Clark (ed.), Springer, New York (1997)). However, it is recognized that constructs or vectors may also contain a promoterless gene that may utilize an endogenous promoter upon insertion. A number of promoters that are active in plant cells have been described in the literature such as the CaMV 35S and FMV promoters. Enhanced or duplicated versions of the CaMV 35S and FMV 35S promoters can also be used to express an aforementioned DNA sequence that decreases expression of an endogenous FAD2-1 gene (Odell et al., Nature 313: 810-812 (1985); U.S. Patent No. 5,378,619). Additional promoters that<br>
maybe utilized are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,378,619; 5,391,725; 5,428,147; 5,447,858; 5,608,144; 5,608,144; 5,614,399; 5,633,441; 5,633,435; and 4,633,436. In addition, a tissue specific enhancer can be used with a basal plant promoter. Basal promoters typically comprise a "TATA" box and an mRNA cap site but lack enhancer elements required for high levels of expression. [00127] Particularly preferred promoters for use in the transgenes of the instant invention are promoters that express a DNA sequence that decreases expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 or FATB gene in seeds or fruits. Indeed, in a preferred embodiment, the promoter used is a seed-specific promoter. Examples of such seed-specific promoters include the 5' regulatory regions from such genes as napin (Kridl etal., Seed Sci. Res. 1:209-219 (1991)), phaseolin, stearoyl-ACP desaturase, 7Sa, 7Sa' (Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 83:8560-8564 (1986)), USP, arcelin and oleosin. Preferred promoters for expression in the seed are 7Sa, 7Sa't napin, and FAD2-1A promoters.<br>
[00128] Constructs or vectors will also typically include a 3' transcriptional terminator or 3' polyadenylation signal that is operably linked to an aforementioned DNA sequence that decreases expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 or FATB gene. The transcriptional termination signal can be any transcriptional termination signal functional in a plant, or any plant transcriptional termination signal. Preferred transcriptional termination signals include, but are not limited to, a pea Rubisco E9 3' sequence, a Brassica napin 3' sequence, a tml 3' sequence, and an Agrobacterium tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid nopaline synthase (NOS) gene 3' sequence. It is understood that this group of exemplary polyadenylation regions is non-limiting and that one skilled in the art could employ other polyadenylation regions that are not explicitly cited here in the practice of this invention.<br>
[00129] Finally, it is also recognized that transgenes of the invention can be inserted in plant transformation vectors that also comprise genes that encode selectable or scoreable markers. The selectable marker gene can be a gene encoding a neomycin phosphotransferase protein, a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein, a gfyphosate resistant 5-eno!-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) protein, a hygromycin phosphotransferase protein, a dihydropteroate synthase protein, a sulfonylurea insensitive acetolactate synthase protein, an atrazine insensitive Q protein, a nitrilase protein capable of degrading bromoxynil, a dehalogenase protein capable of degrading dalapon, a 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate monoxygenase protein, a methotrexate insensitive dihydrofolate reductase protein, and an aminoethylcysteine insensitive octopine synthase protein. The corresponding selective agents used in conjunction with each gene can be: neomycin (for neomycin phosphotransferase protein selection), phosphinotricin (for phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein selection), glyphosate (for glyphosate resistant 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) protein selection), hygromycin (for hygromycin phosphotransferase protein selection), sulfadiazine (for a dihydropteroate synthase protein selection), chlorsulfuron (for a sulfonylurea insensitive acetolactate synthase protein selection), atrazine (for an atrazine insensitive Q protein selection), bromoxinyl (for a nitrilase protein selection), dalapon (for a dehalogenase protein selection), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (for a 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate monoxygenase protein selection), methotrexate (for a methotrexate insensitive dihydrofolate reductase protein selection), or aminoethylcysteine (for an aminoethylcysteine insensitive octopine synthase protein selection). A preferred selectable marker gene is a CP4 EPSPS gene that confers resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. The scoreable marker gene can be a gene<br>
encoding a beta-glucuronidase protein, a green fluorescent protein, a yellow fluorescent protein, a beta-galactosidase protein, a luciferase protein derived from a luc gene, a luciferase protein derived from a lux gene, a sialidase protein, streptomycin phosphotransferase protein, a nopaline synthase protein, an octopine synthase protein or a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase protein.<br>
[00130] The above-described nucleic acid molecules are embodiments which achieve the objects, features and advantages of the present invention. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to the illustrated embodiments. The arrangement of the sequences in the first and second sets of DNA sequences within the nucleic acid molecule is not limited to the illustrated and described arrangements, and may be altered in any manner suitable for achieving the objects, features and advantages of the present invention as described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[00131] B.     Transgenic Organisms, and Methods for Producing Same [00132] Any of the nucleic acid molecules and constructs of the invention may be introduced into a soybean plant or plant cell in a permanent or transient manner. Methods and technology for introduction of DNA into soybean plant cells are well known to those of skill in the art, and virtually any method by which nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into a cell is suitable for use in the present invention. Non-limiting examples of suitable methods include: chemical methods; physical methods such as microinjection, electroporation, the gene gun, microprojectile bombardment, and vacuum infiltration; viral vectors; and receptor-mediated mechanisms. Other methods of cell transformation can also be used and include but<br>
are not limited to introduction of DNA into plants by direct DNA transfer into pollen, by direct injection of DNA into reproductive organs of a plant, or by direct injection of DNA into the cells of immature embryos followed by the rehydration of desiccated embryos.<br>
[00133] Agrobacterium-mediated transfer is a widely applicable system for introducing genes into plant cells. See, e.g., Fraley et at., Bio/Technology 3:629-635 (1985); Rogers et al., Methods EnzymoL 153:253-277 (1987). The region of DNA to be transferred is defined by the border sequences and intervening DNA is usually inserted into the plant genome. Spielmann et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 205:34 (1986). Modern Agrobacterium transformation vectors are capable of replication in E. coli as well as Agrobacterium, allowing for convenient manipulations. Klee et al., In: Plant DNA Infectious Agents, Hohn and Schell (eds.), Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 179-203 (1985). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of soybean is specifically described in U.S. Patent No. 7,002,058.<br>
[00134]Transgenic plants are typically obtained by linking the gene of interest (i.e., in this case a transgene that decreases expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene or that decreases expression of both an FAD2-1 gene or FATB gene) to a selectable marker gene, introducing the linked transgenes into a plant cell, a plant tissue or a plant by any one of the methods described above, and regenerating or otherwise recovering the transgenic plant under conditions requiring expression of said selectable marker gene for plant growth. Exemplary selectable marker genes and the corresponding selective agents have been described in preceding sections of this description of the invention.<br>
[00135] Transgenic plants can also be obtained by linking a gene of interest (i.e. in this case a transgene that decreases expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1<br>
ene or that decreases expression of both an FAD2-1 gene or FATB gene) to a scoreable marker gene, introducing the linked transgenes into a plant cell by any one of the methods described above, and regenerating the transgenic plants from transformed plant cells that test positive for expression of the scoreable marker gene. Exemplary scoreable marker genes have been described in preceding sections of this description of the invention.<br>
[00136] The regeneration, development and cultivation of plants from single plant protoplast transformants or from various transformed explants is well known in the art. See generally, Maliga et al., Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1995); Weissbach and Weissbach, In: Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1988). Plants of the present invention can be part of or generated from a breeding program, and may also be reproduced using apomixis. Methods for the production of apomictic plants are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,811,636.<br>
[00137] A particular method of obtaining low linolenic/mid-oleic soybean plants contemplated herein entails the direct transformation of soybean varieties comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene with a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene. Examples of soybean varieties comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3gene include A5, C1640, 6P248, N98-44, T27111, T27190, T26767, T26830, and Soyolaâ„¢ soybean (see U.S. Patent Application 20060107348 and Burton et al., Crop Sci. 44:687-688, 2004). It is also contemplated that other soybean lines that comprise at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene and that possess agronomically elite growth and/or yield characteristics produced by the marker-assisted breeding<br>
methods disclosed in see U.S. Patent Application 20060107348 could be directly transformed with a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene. Alternatively, it is also contemplated that soybean lines that comprise at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene and that are amenable to transformation can be produced by the marker-assisted breeding methods disclosed in see U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676 Soybean plants comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene and that are amenable to transformation can also be directly transformed with a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene. Three other low linolenic soybeans that could be directly transformed by the methods of the invention include BARC12, which is a determinant maturity group #3 line, Vistiveâ„¢ soybean lines (Monsanto, St.Louis, MO., USA), or 0137648/01AHKW-38, which is a yellow hilum L2 NUL line. [00138] It is also contemplated that the low linolenic soybean plants that are directly transformed with the transgene in the methods of the invention can be derived from soybean germplasm comprising soybean plant genomic regions that contain fad3-1b-, fad3-1c~, or both fad3-1b~ and fad3~1c- alleles that confer decreased linolenic acid content Such single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the low linolenic soybean phenotype are described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. In certain embodiments, a soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61. In another embodiment, the soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1C gene sequence<br>
corresponding to nucleotide 687, 1129, 1203, 2316, 3292, 3360 or 3743 of SEQ ID NO:62. In another embodiment, the soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1C promoter corresponding to nucleotide 334, 364, 385, 387, 393, 729 or 747 of SEQ ID NO:63. In another embodiment, the soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a deletion in the FAD3-1C gene. The soybean genomic regions that confer the low linolenic acid content phenotype can also be characterized by both a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61 and a deletion in the FAD3-1c gene sequence. The soybean genomic regions that confer the low linolenic acid content phenotype can also be characterized by both a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61 and a polymorphism in the FAD3-1C promoter, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position corresponding to nucleotide 334, 364, 385, 387, 393, 729 or 747 of SEQ ID NO:63. Soybean germplasm comprising a deletion in the Soybean FAD3-1C gene is useful in the practice of these methods and can be obtained from soybean lines that include but are not limited to soybean lines 6P248, T27111, T27190, T26767, T26830 and A5, described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676.<br>
[00139] Detecting the single nucleotide polymorphisms may be carried out by any method, including PCR, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cleavage fragment length polymorphism analysis and/or DNA sequencing as described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. Alternatively, the single nucleotide polymorphism can be detected by<br>
any one of assay is selected from the group consisting of single base extension (SBE), allele-specific primer extension sequencing (ASPE), sequencing, universal PCR, allele specific extension, hybridization, mass spectrometry, ligation, extension-ligation, and Flap Endonuclease-mediated assays.   Primers and methods for detection of the aforementioned FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C genetic polymorphisms are described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. Deletions such as those in the FAD3-1C gene can be detected by methods including but not limited to PCR, hybridization, cleavage fragment length polymorphism analysis and/or DNA sequencing-based methods.<br>
[00140] Direct transformation methods as described above can also be used to obtain low linolenic/low saturate/mid-oleic soybean plants. In these methods, the aforementioned low linolenic soybean plants are directly transformed with transgenes that decrease the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous soybean FATB gene for production of soybean plants with a low linolenic, low saturate, mid-oleic acid phenotype.<br>
[00141] Transgenes that may be used in plant transformation or transfection may be any of the transgenes that decrease expression of either: 1) the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene(s) or 2) both the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and FATB gene(s). It is further contemplated that vectors comprising transgenes that decrease expression of either: 1) the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene(s) or 2) both the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and FATB gene(s) can also comprise or be genetically combined with additional transgenes. For example, additional transgenes that express other genes that affect oil composition, pathogen resistance, yield, morphology, protein composition, amino acid composition, starch composition, and phytate level are described in U.S. Patent Application NO.<br>
11/239,676 and can be combined with the transgenes and low linolenic mutants described herein.<br>
[00142] It is not intended that the present invention be limited to the illustrated embodiments. Exemplary nucleic acid molecules have been described in Part A of the Detailed Description, and further non-limiting exemplary nucleic acid molecules are described below and illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, and in the Examples.<br>
C. Crosses of Soybean Plants Containing Transgenes<br>
[00143] In another aspect, a plant of the invention can be crossed with another plant that is transgenic or non-transgenic. A plant can be crossed with another plant that has an oil composition containing modified levels of fatty acids, for example without limitation, a variety with an oil composition having a lower level of linolenic acid. In a preferred embodiment, a plant of the present invention is crossed with a variety with less than 3% by weight linolenic acid. In another embodiment of the invention, a plant of the present invention is crossed with another plant having greater than 20% by weight stearic acid. Such plants having modified levels of fatty acids are known in the art and described, for example, in Hawkins and Kridl (1998) Plant Journal 13(6):743-752 and U.S. Patent No. 6,365,802.<br>
[00144] In particular, crosses of soybean plants comprising a transgene that either decrease the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene or decrease the expression of both the endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and FATB gene(s) with soybean varieties comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene are contemplated by the methods of this invention. Examples of soybean varieties comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene include A5, C1640, 6P248, N98-44, T27111,<br>
T27190, T26767, T26830, and Soyolaâ„¢ soybean (see U.S. Patent Application 20060107348 and Burton et al., Crop Sci. 44:687-688, 2004). It is also contemplated that other soybean lines that comprise at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene and that possess agronomically elite growth and/or yield characteristics produced by the marker-assisted breeding methods disclosed in see U.S. Patent Application 20060107348 could be crossed with soybean plants comprising a transgene that decreases the expression of an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 gene. Three other low linolenic crossing parents that could be used in the methods of the invention include BARC12, which is a determinant maturity group #3 line, Vistiveâ„¢ soybean lines, or 0137648/01AHKW-38, which is a yellow hilum l_2 NUL line.<br>
[00145] It is also contemplated that the low iinolenic soybean plants used in the cross to the transgene(s) can be derived from soybean germplasm comprising soybean plant genomic regions that contain fad3-1b-, fad3-1c-, or both fad3~1b- and fad3-1c- alleles that confer decreased linolenic acid content. Such single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the low linolenic soybean phenotype are described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. In certain embodiments, a soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61. In another embodiment, the soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1C gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 687, 1129, 1203, 2316, 3292, 3360 or 3743 of SEQ ID NO:62. In another embodiment, the soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a single<br>
nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1C promoter corresponding to nucleotide 334, 364, 385, 387, 393, 729 or 747 of SEQ ID NO:63. In another embodiment, the soybean genomic region that confers the low linolenic acid content phenotype is characterized by a deletion in the FAD3-1C gene. The soybean genomic regions that confer the low linolenic acid content phenotype can also be characterized by both a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61 and a deletion in the FAD3-1C gene sequence. The soybean genomic regions that confer the low linolenic acid content phenotype can also be characterized by both a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position in the FAD3-1B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61 and a polymorphism in the FAD3-1C promoter, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism at a position corresponding to nucleotide 334, 364, 385, 387, 393, 729 or 747 of SEQ ID NO:63. Soybean germplasm comprising a deletion in the Soybean FAD3-1C gene is useful in the practice of these methods and can be obtained from soybean lines that include but are not limited to soybean lines 6P248, T27111, T27190, T26767, T26830 and A5, described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. Tables 3 and 4 of the Examples describe the association of specific polymorphisms with specific soybean germplasm or soybean lines that display low linolenic acid phenotypes. [00146] Without being limited by theory, it is further noted that certain polymorphisms and deletions in certain FAD3-1C genes are potentially responsible in part for the low linolenic acid phenotypes displayed by soybean plants that carry these polymorphisms or deletions. The SNP at 2021 position in SEQ ID NO:61 is a sense mutation that changes an amino acid residue from Histidine to Tyrosine. The histidine residue has been found to be critical in a number of genes involved with<br>
desaturation. This particular SNP found caused a mutation in the motif His-Val-lte-His-His to His-Val-lle-His-Tyr in the low linolenic lines. The motif has been associated with a low-linolenic phenotype and is a likely cause for the reduced linolenic acid phenotype observed in soybeans with this polymorphism. [00147] Detecting the single nucleotide polymorphism may be carried out by any method, including PCR, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cleavage fragment length polymorphism analysis and/or DNA sequencing as described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. Alternatively, the single nucleotide polymorphism can be detected by any one of assay is selected from the group consisting of single base extension (SBE), allele-specific primer extension sequencing (ASPE), sequencing, universal PCR, allele specific extension, hybridization, mass spectrometry, ligation, extension-ligation, and Flap Endonuclease-mediated assays. Primers and methods for detection of the aforementioned FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C genetic polymorphisms are described in U.S. Patent Application NO. 11/239,676. Deletions such as those in the FAD3-1C gene can be detected by methods including but not limited to PCR, hybridization, cleavage fragment length polymorphism analysis and/or DNA sequencing -based methods.<br>
[00148] Crossing methods as described above can also be used to obtain low linolenic/low saturate/mid-oleic soybean plants. In these methods, the aforementioned low linolenic soybean plants are crossed with soybean plants comprising transgenes that decrease the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous soybean FATB gene for production of soybean plants with a low linolenic, low saturate, mid-oleic acid phenotype.<br>
[00149] It is further contemplated that the crosses of the transgene(s) to the low linolenic soybean lines can be facilitated by linkage of a selectable marker that confers resistance to a herbicide. For example, in crosses of soybean plants that are heterozygous for the transgene with plants that are either homozygous or heterozygous for the allele(s) conferring the low linolenic trait, F1 progeny that are heterozygous for the transgene can be selected by herbicide treatment. Also, F2 plants derived from F1 plants that are heterozygous for the transgene can be enriched for F2 soybean plants that are homozygous for said transgene by subjecting said plurality of F2 plants to herbicide selection for the transgene. Molecular markers that can distinguish soybean plants that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the transgene can also be used to identify soybean plants that are homozygous for the transgene insertion.<br>
[00150] Soybean plants (Glycine max L.) can be crossed by either natural or mechanical techniques. Natural pollination occurs in soybeans either by self pollination or natural cross pollination, which typically is aided by pollinating organisms. In either natural or artificial crosses, flowering and flowering time are an important consideration. Soybean is a short-day plant, but there is considerable genetic variation for sensitivity to photopenod. The critical day length for flowering ranges from about 13 h for genotypes adapted to tropical latitudes to 24 h for photoperiod-insensitive genotypes grown at higher latitudes. Soybeans seem to be insensitive to day length for 9 days after emergence. Photoperiods shorter than the critical day length are required for 7 to 26 days to complete flower induction. [00151] Soybean flowers typically are self-pollinated on the day the corolla opens. The stigma is receptive to pollen about 1 day before anthesis and remains receptive for 2 days after anthesis, if the flower petals are not removed. Filaments of nine<br>
stamens are fused, and the one nearest the standard is free. The stamens form a ring below the stigma until about 1 day before anthesis, then their filaments begin to elongate rapidly and elevate the anthers around the stigma. The anthers dehisce on the day of anthesis, pollen grains fall on the stigma, and within 10 h the pollen tubes reach the ovary and fertilization is completed. Self-pollination occurs naturally in soybean with no manipulation of the flowers. For the crossing of two soybean plants, it is typically preferable, although not required, to utilize artificial hybridization. In artificial hybridization, the flower used as a female in a cross is manually cross pollinated prior to maturation of pollen from the flower, thereby preventing self fertilization, or alternatively, the male parts of the flower are emasculated using a technique known in the art. Techniques for emasculating the male parts of a soybean flower include, for example, physical removal of the male parts, use of a genetic factor conferring male sterility, and application of a chemical gametocide to the male parts<br>
[00152] Either with or without emasculation of the female flower, hand pollination can be carried out by removing the stamens and pistil with a forceps from a flower of the male parent and gently brushing the anthers against the stigma of the female flower. Access to the stamens can be achieved by removing the front sepal and keel petals, or piercing the keel with closed forceps and allowing them to open to push the petals away. Brushing the anthers on the stigma causes them to rupture, and the highest percentage of successful crosses is obtained when pollen is clearly visible on the stigma. Pollen shed can be checked by tapping the anthers before brushing the stigma. Several male flowers may have to be used to obtain suitable pollen shed when conditions are unfavorable, or the same male may be used to pollinate several flowers with good pollen shed.<br>
[00153] Genetic male sterility is available in soybeans and may be useful to facilitate hybridization in the context of the current invention, particularly for recurrent selection programs. The distance required for complete isolation of a crossing block is not clear; however, out-crossing is less than 0.5% when male-sterile plants are 12 m or more from a foreign pollen source (Boerma and Moradshahi, Crop Sci., 15:858-861,1975). Plants on the boundaries of a crossing block probably sustain the most out-crossing with foreign pollen and can be eliminated at harvest to minimize contamination.<br>
[00154] Once harvested, pods are typically air-dried at not more than 38Â°C until the seeds contain 13% moisture or less, then the seeds are removed by hand. Seed can be stored satisfactorily at about 25Â°C for up to a year if relative humidity is 50% or less. In humid climates, germination percentage declines rapidly unless the seed is dried to 7% moisture and stored in an air-tight container at room temperature. Long-term storage in any climate is best accomplished by drying seed to 7% moisture and storing it at 10Â°C or less in a room maintained at 50% relative humidity or in an air-tight container.<br>

[00174] G.     Modulation of Suppression<br>
[00175] Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method of modulating gene suppression levels. Modulation of gene suppression can result in more or less gene suppression. Suppression of a gene product can be the result from insertion of a construct of the present invention into a plant genome. Similarly, modulation of gene suppression can be the result from insertion of a construct of the present invention into a plant genome. Other examples of methods to modulate gene suppression include, without limitation, antisense techniques, cosuppression, RNA interference (dsRNAi), transgenic animals, hybrids, and ribozymes using a construct of the present invention. The following examples are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.<br>
[00176] Suppression of a gene can be modulated by altering the length of the transcribable DNA used for suppression, which sequence is derived from the gene targeted for suppression. Many methods can be used for suppressing a gene using post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms. Without being limited to the theory, these methods are believe to have in common the expression of an RNA molecule which hybridizes to another RNA molecule. Surprisingly, there can be advantages to using an RNA molecule of particular lengths to modulate or moderate suppression of the steady state expression levels of a targeted endogenous gene. [00177] Gene suppression of FAD2-1 leads to elevated levels of oleic acid and reduction of linoleic acid levels. When FAD2-1 is heavily suppressed, levels of oleic acid can be greater than 65%, which causes a reduction in palmitic acid and linolenic acid levels. For example, when FAD2-1 is suppressed, oleic acid levels can reach 85% and the combined palmitic and stearic acid levels are reduced to about 10%. Similarly, downregulation of FATB results in decreased levels of saturated fatty acids, primarily palmitate. When FAD2 and FATB are suppressed so that oleic levels are about 85%, saturate levels are about 10%. When FAD2 and FATB are suppressed so that oleic levels are greater than 85%, saturate levels can fall below 10%.<br>
[00178] In light of the present invention, saturate levels can be reduced to less than 10% without enhancing oleic acids above 85%. In one embodiment, the suppression of FAD2 is modulated by reducing the length of FAD2-1 intron introduced into the plant. Less suppression of FAD2 results in moderate levels of oleic acid, approximately 40-85% oleic acid. The suppression of FAD2 is reduced as the length of the FAD2-1 intron fragment introduced is reduced. For example, a FAD2-1 intron reduced in length by at least 100 contiguous nucleotides can reduce the suppression<br>
of FAD2 and the corresponding increase in oleic acid and decrease in linoleic acid levels.<br>
[00179] The relationship between the decrease in endogenous gene suppression and the decrease in length of homologous DNA can be determined empirically by introducing different lengths of DNA. For example, the amount of reduction in suppression obtainable by reducing the length of homologous introduced DNA can be determined by deleting increasing portions of the homologous DNA being introduced and assaying for expression of the targeted gene. [00180] Included in the present invention is a method for moderating suppression of FAD2 while still having a strong reduction of saturate levels in a plant. In such plants, oleic acid levels can range from 40-85%. Similarly, less than full suppression of FATB occurs when the combined 3' and 5' untranslated regions are introduced as compared to when the full-length FATB gene is introduced into a host cell. In a like manner, suppression levels of FATB are reduced when the 5' part of the open reading frame, which mostly encodes the chloroplast transit peptide, is introduced into a host cell. In cells with FAD2 and FATB suppressed using methods according to the present invention, oleic acid levels can be 40-85% while saturate levels can be between 1 to 9 percent.<br>
[00181] In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of modulating gene suppression to reduce suppression relative to the suppression from an entire gene element, where an entire gene element can be an entire gene, an entire exon, an entire intron, an entire signal sequence, or an entire UTR, then constructing a recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprising a fragment of the endogenous sequence from the gene element; initiating expression of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule in a host cell; and suppressing the endogenous<br>
gene with the recombinant nucleic acid molecule. The gene being suppressed can be any gene, including FAD2 and FATB. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of modulating FAD2 or FATB suppression comprising: expressing a partial FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence in a host cell, where a FAD2 or FATB gene element is from an endogenous FAD2 or FATB gene in the host cell and a FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence can be a FAD2 or FATB gene, a FAD2 or FATB exon, a FAD2 or FATB intron, a FAD2 or FATB transit peptide coding region, or a FAD2 or FATB UTR; and the partial FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence is less than the entire FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence; and suppressing an endogenous FAD2 or FATB with the partial FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence, where suppression levels of the FAD2 or FATB endogenous gene in the host cell are less than suppression levels of the FAD2 or FATB endogenous gene in a host cell with a similar genetic background and a second FAD2 or FATB nucleic acid sequence comprising the entire FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence of the FAD2 or FATB gene element.<br>
[00182] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of altering the oil composition of a plant cell by transforming a plant cell with a recombinant nucleic acid molecule which comprises a DNA sequence that suppresses endogenous expression of FAD2, FATB, or FAD2 and FATB where the DNA sequence comprises a nucleic acid sequence of FAD2, FATB, or FAD2 and FATB that is shorter than the entire sequence of an entire genetic element selected from a gene, an exon, an intron, a transit peptide coding region, a 3'-UTR, a 5'-UTR, and an open reading frame; and growing the plant cell under conditions where transcription of said DNA sequence is initiated, whereby the oil composition is altered relative to a plant cell with a similar genetic background but lacking the<br>
recombinant nucleic acid molecule. A gene element of FAD2 or FATB can be shortened in length by 50, 75, 100, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 nucleotides. A length of a gene element of FAD2 or FATB can be 50, 75, 100, 150, 175, 200, 220, 250, 300, 320, 350, 400, 420, 450, 500, 550, 600, 800, or 1000 nucleotides.<br>
[00183] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of enhancing oleic acid content and reducing saturated fatty acid content in a plant seed by: i) shortening the length of an exogenous FAD2 DNA sequence in a host cell until the amount of suppression of FAD2 expression from a transformed plant is at least partially reduced relative to the suppression of FAD2 expression in a host cell with a similar genetic background and an entire exogenous FAD2 gene DNA sequence; and ii) growing a plant with a nucleic acid molecule comprising the shortened FAD2 DNA sequence, where the shortened FAD2 DNA sequence at least partially suppresses endogenous expression of FAD2; and iii) cultivating a plant that produces seed with a reduced saturated fatty acid content relative to seed from a plant having a similar genetic background but lacking the shortened FAD2 DNA sequence. The amount that the exogenous FAD2 DNA sequence is shortened to at least partially reduce suppression of the endogenous FAD2 can be determined empirically by introducing different lengths of DNA. For example, the amount of reduction in suppression obtainable by reducing the length of homologous introduced DNA can be determined by deleting increasing portions of the homologous DNA being introduced and assaying for expression of the targeted gene. The amount of suppression of FAD2 expression can be obtained as an average of three or more, six or more, ten or more, fifteen or more, or twenty or more seeds from a plant.<br>
[00184] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of producing a transformed plant having seed with a reduced saturated fatty acid content by transforming a plant cell with a recombinant nucleic acid molecule which comprises a DNA sequence that suppresses the endogenous expression of FAD2 and FATS, where the DNA sequence comprises a nucleic acid sequence of FAD2 that is shorter than the entire sequence of an entire genetic element selected from a gene, an exon, an intron, a transit peptide coding region, and a UTR; and growing the transformed plant, where the transformed plant produces seed with a reduced saturated fatty acid content relative to seed from a plant having a similar genetic background but lacking said recombinant nucleic acid molecule. [00185] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of modulating the fatty acid composition of oil from a seed of a temperate oilseed crop by isolating a genetic element of at least 40 nucleotides in length that is capable of suppressing the expression of an endogenous gene in the fatty acid synthesis pathway; generating more than one shortened fragment of the genetic element; introducing each of the more than one shortened fragments into a plant cell of the temperate oilseed crop to produce transgenic plants; and selecting a transgenic plant comprising a shortened fragment of determined length and sequence that effects a desirable change in seed oil fatty acid composition. In a preferred embodiment, the method above also includes constructing a recombinant DNA construct having at least two shortened fragments of two different endogenous genes that effect different desirable changes in seed oil fatty acid composition; introducing the recombinant DNA construct into a plant cell of the temperate oilseed crop to produce transgenic plants; and selecting a transgenic plant comprising the at<br>
 <br>
least two shortened fragments and a fatty acid composition of oil from a seed having more than one desirable change effected by the at least two shortened fragments. [00186] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a soybean seed exhibiting an oil composition having a strongly reduced saturated fatty acid content and a moderately enhanced oleic acid content having a DNA sequence that suppresses the endogenous expression of FAD2 in a host cell, where the DNA sequence has a nucleic acid sequence of FAD2 that is shorter than the entire sequence of an entire genetic element selected from a gene, an exon, an intron, a transit peptide coding region, and a UTR.<br>

These four sequences are aligned to form a genomic sequence for the FATB-2 gene (SEQ ID NO: 43).<br>
[00193] Four introns are identified in the soybean FATB-2 gene by comparison of the genomic sequence to the cDNA sequence: intron I (SEQ ID NO: 44) spans base 119 to base 1333 of the genomic sequence (SEQ ID NO: 43) and is 1215 bp in length; intron II (SEQ ID NO: 45) spans base 2231 to base 2568 of the genomic sequence (SEQ ID NO: 43) and is 338 bp in length; intron III (SEQ ID NO: 46) spans base 2702 to base 3342 of the genomic sequence (SEQ ID NO: 43) and is 641 bp in length; and intron IV (SEQ ID NO: 47) spans base 3457 to base 3823 of the genomic sequence (SEQ ID NO: 43) and is 367 bp in length.<br>

[00195]2A.   FAD2-1 Constructs<br>
[00196] The FAD2-1A intron #1(SEQ ID NO: 1) is cloned into the expression<br>
cassette, pCGN3892, in sense and antisense orientations. The vector pCGN3892<br>
contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'. Both gene fusions are then<br>
separately ligated into pCGN9372, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene<br>
regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting expression constructs (pCGN5469<br>
sense and pCGN5471 antisense, depicted in Figures 1 and 2, respectively) are used for transformation of soybean.<br>
[00197] The FAD2-1B intron (SEQ ID NO: 2) is fused to the 3' end of the FAD2-1A intron #1 in plasmid pCGN5468 (contains the soybean 7S promoter fused to the FAD2-1A intron (sense) and a pea rbcS 3') or pCGN5470 (contains the soybean 7S promoter fused to the FAD2-1A intron (antisense) and a pea rbcS 3') in sense and antisense orientation, respectively. The resulting intron combination fusions are then ligated separately into pCGN9372, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting expression constructs (pCGN5485, FAD2-1A &amp; FAD2-1B intron sense and pCGN5486, FAD2-1A &amp; FAD2-1B intron antisense) are used for transformation of soybean. [00198] 2B.   FAD3-1 Constructs<br>
[00199] FAD3-1A introns #1, #2, #4 and #5 (SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8, 10 and 11, respectively), FAD3-1B introns #3C (SEQ ID NO: 23) and #4 (SEQ ID NO: 24), are all ligated separately into pCGN3892, in sense or antisense orientation. pCGN3892 contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'. These fusions are ligated into pCGN9372, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter for transformation into soybean. The resulting expression constructs (PCGN5455, FAD3-1A intron #4 sense; pCGN5459, FAD3-1A intron #4 antisense; pCGN5456, FAD3 intron #5 sense; pCGN5460, FAD3-1A intron #5 antisense, PCGN5466, FAD3-1A intron #2 antisense; pCGN5473, FAD3-1A intron #1 antisense) are used for transformation of soybean. [00200] 2C.   FatB Constructs<br>
[00201] The soybean FATB-1 intron II sequence (SEQ ID NO: 30) is amplified via PCR using a FATB-1  partial genomic clone as a template. PCR amplification is<br>
carried out as follows: 1 cycle, 95Â°C for 10 min; 25 cycles, 95C for 30 sec, 62Â°Â°C for 30 sec, 72Â°C for 30 sec; 1 cycle, 72Â°C for 7 min. PCR amplification results in a product that is 854 bp long, including reengineered restriction sites at both ends. The PCR product is cloned directly into the expression cassette pCGN3892 in sense orientation, by way of Xhol sites engineered onto the 5' ends of the PCR primers, to form pMON70674. Vector pCGN3892 contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'. pMON70674 is then cut with Notl and ligated into pMON41164, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting gene expression construct, pMON70678, is used for transformation of soybean using Agrobacterium methods. [00202] 2D    Combination Constructs<br>
[00203] Expression constructs are made containing various permutations of: 1) a FAD2-1 sequences alone (for low linolenic, mid -oleic soybean production methods) and 2) combinations of FAD2-1 and FATB DNA sequences. The DNA sequences are any of those described, or illustrated in Table 2, or any other set of DNA sequences that contain various combinations of sense, antisense, or sense and antisense FAD2 and/or FATB non-coding or coding regions so that they are capable of forming dsRNA constructs, sense cosuppression constructs, antisense constructs, or various combinations of the foregoing.<br>
[00204] FIGURE 4 depicts DNA sequences which are capable of expressing sense cosuppression or antisense constructs according to the present invention, the non-coding sequences of which are described in Table 1 and 2 below. The non-coding sequences may be single sequences, combinations of sequences (e.g., the 5'UTR linked to the 3'UTR), or any combination of the foregoing. To express a sense cosuppression construct, all of the non-coding sequences are sense sequences, and<br>
to express an antisense construct, all of the non-coding sequences are antisense sequences. To expressing sense and antisense constructs, both sense and antisense non-coding sequences are provided.<br>
[00205] FIGURE 5 depict several first sets of DNA sequences which are capable of expressing dsRNA constructs according to the present invention, the non-coding sequences of which are described in Tables 1 and 2 below. The first set of DNA sequences depicted in FIG. 5 comprises pairs of related sense and antisense sequences, arranged such that, e.g., the RNA expressed by the first sense sequence is capable of forming a double-stranded RNA with the antisense RNA expressed by the first antisense sequence. For example, referring to the topmost vector of FIGURE 5 and illustrative combination No. 1 (of Table 1), the first set of DNA sequences comprises a sense FAD2-1 sequence, a sense FAD3-1 sequence, an antisense FAD2-1 sequence and an antisense FAD3-1 sequence. Both antisense sequences correspond to the sense sequences so that the expression products of the first set of DNA sequences are capable of forming a double-stranded RNA with each other. The sense sequences may be separated from the antisense sequences by a spacer sequence, preferably one that promotes the formation of a dsRNA molecule. Examples of such spacer sequences include those set forth in Wesley et al., supra, and Hamilton et al., Plant J., 15:737-746 (1988). The promoter is any promoter functional in a plant, or any plant promoter. Non-limiting examples of suitable promoters are described in Part A of the Detailed Description. [00206] The first set of DNA sequences is inserted in an expression construct in either the sense or anti-sense orientation using a variety of DNA manipulation techniques.   If convenient restriction sites are present in the DNA sequences, they are inserted into the expression construct by digesting with the restriction<br>
endonucleases and ligation into the construct that has been digested at one or more of the available cloning sites. If convenient restriction sites are not available in the DNA sequences, the DNA of either the construct or the DNA sequences is modified in a variety of ways to facilitate cloning of the DNA sequences into the construct. Examples of methods to modify the DNA include by PCR, synthetic linker or adapter ligation, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, filling in or cutting back of overhanging 5' or 3' ends, and the like. These and other methods of manipulating DNA are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. [00207] Table<br>

[00220] When the two T-DNA segments of the any one of the above constructs (i.e. pMON95829, pMON97595, pMON97581, pMON97597, pMON97598) are inserted into a single locus of the chromosome of a host organism in a RB to RB orientation, the assembled transcription unit has a soybean 7Sa' promoter operably linking sense and anti-sense- oriented soybean FAD2-1A intron 1 and FATB-1a DNA fragments. When transcribed, the operably linked sense and anti-sense oriented RNA sequences are capable of forming double-stranded RNA effective for suppression of FAD2-1AandFATB.<br>
[00221] Example 4 Plant Transformation and Analysis<br>
[00222] The constructs of Examples 2 and 3 are stably introduced into soybean (for example, Asgrow variety A4922 or Asgrow variety A3244 or Asgrow variety A3525) by the methods described earlier, including the methods of McCabe et al., Bio/Technology, 6:923-926 (1988), or Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transformed soybean plants are identified by selection on media containing a selectable agent or herbicide. The herbicide can be glyphosate when a transgene conferring resistance to glyphosate is used. Fatty acid compositions are analyzed<br>
from seed of soybean lines transformed with the constructs using gas chromatography.<br>
[00223] For some applications, modified fatty acid compositions are detected in developing seeds, whereas in other instances, such as for analysis of oil profile, detection of fatty acid modifications occurring later in the FAS pathway, or for detection of minor modifications to the fatty acid composition, analysis of fatty acid or oil from mature seeds is performed. Furthermore, analysis of oil and/or fatty acid content of individual seeds may be desirable, especially in detection of oil modification in the segregating R1 seed populations  As used herein, RO generation indicates the plant arising from transformation/regeneration protocols described herein, the R1 generation indicates seeds grown on the selfed transgenic RO plant. R1 plants are grown from the R1 seeds.<br>
[00224] Fatty acid compositions are determined for the seed of soybean lines transformed with the constructs of Example 3. One to ten seeds of each of the transgenic and control soybean lines are ground individually using a tissue homogenizer (Pro Scientific) for oil extraction. Oil from ground soybean seed is extracted overnight in 1.5 ml heptane containing triheptadecanoin (0.50 mg/ml) Aliquots of 200 pi of the extracted oil are derivatized to methyl esters with the addition of 500 pi sodium methoxide in absolute methanol. The derivatization reaction is allowed to progress for 20 minutes at 50Â°C. The reaction is stopped by the simultaneous addition of 500 ul 10% (w/v) sodium chloride and 400 pi heptane. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters extracted in hexane are resolved by gas chromatography (GC) on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 GC (Palo Alto, CA). The GC was fitted with a Supelcowax 250 column (30 m, 0.25 mm id, 0.25 micron film thickness) (Supeico, Bellefonte, PA). Column temperature is 175Â°C at injection and<br>
the temperature programmed from 175Â°C to 245Â°C to 175Â°C at 40Â°C/min. Injector and detector temperatures are 250Â°C and 270Â°C, respectively.<br>
[00225] Example 5.<br>
[00226] This example illustrates plant transformation to produce soybean plants with suppressed genes.<br>
[00227] A transformation vector pMON68537 is used to introduce an intron/3'UTR double-stranded RNA-forming construct into soybean for suppressing the A12 desaturase, A15 desaturase, and FATB genes. Vector pMON68537 also contains the delta-9 desaturase (FAB2) and the CP4 genes. The pMON68537 vector is designed for plant transformation to suppress FAD2, FAD3, and FATB genes and overexpress delta-9 desaturase in soybean. In particular, the construct comprises a 7S alpha promoter operably linked to soybean sense-oriented intron and 3'UTRs, i.e., a FAD2-1A intron #1, a FAD3-1A 3'UTR, a FATB-1 3'UTR, a hairpin loop-forming sphceable intron, and a complementary series of soybean anti-sense-oriented intron and 3'UTR's, i.e., a FATB-1 3'UTR, a FAD3-1A 3'UTR and a FAD2-1A intron #1 and the soybean FAD2 promoter driving the deita-9 desaturase. The vector is stably introduced into soybean (Asgrow variety A4922) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI (Martinell, U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301). The CP4 selectable marker allows transformed soybean plants to be identified by selection on media containing glyphosate herbicide.<br>
[00228] Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with the intron/3'UTR dsRNAi expression constructs using gas chromatography. R1 pooled seed and R1 single seed oil compositions demonstrate that the mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions are altered in the oil of<br>
seeds from transgenic soybean lines as compared to that of the seed from non-transformed soybean, (See Table 3). For instance, FAD2 suppression provides plants with increased amount of oleic acid ester compounds; FAD3 suppression provides plants with decreased linolenic acid ester compounds; and FATB suppression provides plants with reduced saturated fatty ester compounds, e.g palmitates and stearates. Selections can be made from such lines depending on the desired relative fatty acid composition. Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with constructs using gas chromatography.

 [00230] Example 6. FAD2-1/FATB dsRNAi construct in transgenic soybean [00231] Construct pMON95829 as described in Example 3D is used to introduce a FAD2-1 intron, FATB, double-stranded RNA-forming construct into soybean for suppressing the FAD2 gene and FATB genes. The vector is stably introduced into soybean (Asgrow variety A4922) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI (Martinell, U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301). The CP4 selectable marker allows transformed soybean plants to be identified by selection on media containing glyphosate herbicide. Subsequently, the genomes of transformed plants are screened for concurrent tandem insertion of the first T-DNA and the second T-DNA, i.e in the "right border to right border" assembly. Screening is done with Southern hybridization mapping methods. Transformed soybean plants containing the preferred configuration in their genome are transferred to a green house for seed production.<br>
[00232] For example, leaf tissue was taken from the R0 plants transformed with construct pMON95829 and Southern analysis is performed. Probes and restriction enzyme digests are chosen in order to identify events containing a right-border-right-border ("RB-RB") assembly of both T-DNAs. Typically, approximately 25% of all transformants have properly assembled RB-RB T-DNAs. [00233] Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with a pMON95829 construct using gas chromatography as described in Example 4 to identify methyl esters of fatty acid compounds extracted from seeds.<br>
First, six R1 seeds taken from soybean plants transformed with construct pMON95829 are harvested, and the fatty acid composition of each single seed is determined   Since R1 plants of each event are segregating for the transgenes and, therefore, yield seeds with conventional soybean composition, as well as modified versions. The positive seeds are pooled and averaged for each event. The pooled positive averages demonstrate that the mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions are altered in the oil of seeds from transgenic soybean lines as compared to that of the seed from non-transformed soybean (See Table 4). For example, FAD2 suppression provides plants with increased amount of oleic acid ester compounds and FATB suppression provides plants with reduced saturated fatty ester compounds, e.g. palmitates and stearates.

[00237] Construct pMON93505 is stably introduced into soybean (Asgrow variety A4922) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI (Martinefl, U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301).

[00244] Example 9 Crosses of mid-oleic transgenic soybean with low linolenic soybean<br>
[00245] A soybean plant of a line with seeds having mid-oleic acid levels in its oil is crossed with a plant from a line with normal oleic acid levels but about 2.8% linolenic acid (18:3). This cross results in a soybean line producing oil with the combined properties, mid-oleic acid and low linolenic acid.<br>
[00246] Briefly, plant breeding was performed as described below. One parent line, a transgenic soybean line, labeled event GM_A22234, contains the plasmid pMON68504 in a chromosome. pMON68504 is a 2T-DNA construct having a 7S promoter operably linked to a FAD2-1A intron #1 (SEQ ID NO: 2; PCT Publication WO 2001014538) in sense orientation in order to partially suppress the endogenous FAD2 gene and a CP4 selectable marker gene. The oil extracted from the seeds of this line contains approximately 65% oleic acid, up from the 20% of conventional soybean oil (see Table 25). Another parent line is a non-transgenic variety 6p248-5 (C1640 line) which has a linolenic acid content of about 3% by weight of total fatty acids in its seeds, as compared to the conventional 8-9% linolenic acid found in normal soybean oil (see Table 25). The reduction in linolenic acid is caused by a<br>
fad3-1b-/fad3-1c- double mutant. (See Wilcox, J.R. and J.F. Cavins, Inheritance of<br>
low linolenic acid content of the seed of a mutant of Glycine max., Theoretical and<br>
Applied Genetics 71: 74-78, 1985).<br>
[00247] Plants of the transgenic line GM_A22234 (used as female) and the mutant<br>
line 6p248-5 (used as the male) were crossed. Thirty F1 seeds were produced and<br>
planted to produce 2.3 lbs of selfed F2 seeds. Putative triple homozygous seeds<br>
were identified from 200 F2 seeds through single seed fatty acid methyl-ester<br>
(FAME) analysis of seed chips. Twenty-seven seeds with about 60% 18:1, about<br>
20% 18:2, and about 2-3% 18:3 were identified and planted to produce selfed F3<br>
seeds<br>
[00248] For marker analysis, F2 leaf tissue samples were collected and established<br>
molecular markers for the FAD3 mutant alleles were used to identify double positive<br>
plants (plants having both FAD3-1B and FAD3-1C mutations). Three genotypes<br>
were targeted for recovery from this experiment: 1) fad3~1b-/fad3-1c -double<br>
homozygous mutants , 2) single homozygous plants for the fad3-1c- allele alone;<br>
and 3) single homozygous for fad3-1b- allele alone.<br>
[00249]The F2 plants were single plant harvested, and 10 F3 seed sub-samples<br>
were analyzed. From 27 seeds with about 60% 18:1 (oleic acid), about 20% 18:2<br>
(Hnoleic acid), and about 2-3% 18:3 (linolenic acid), 5 plants were identified as<br>
putative double-FAD3 mutant and were bulked together for further growth. Table 25<br>
summarizes the F3 seed composition data from 120 F2 plants.<br>
[00250]<br>
[00251] Table 7. Mid-oleic acid phenotype/fad3 mutant stack- F3 seed fatty acid<br>
composition<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [00252] The triple fad3-1b-, fad3~1c-, mid-oleic acid line (GM_AA22234) has 1.9% 18:3 linolenic and 74.3% of oleic acid. The combination offad3-1b- and fad3-1c-mutants with the transgenic mid-oleic (GM_AA22234) locus leads to further reduction of linolenic and increase of oleic relative to the respective parent lines. [00253] To evaluate the field efficacy of the triple fad3-1b-, fad3-1c-, mid-oleic (GM_AA22234) line, the breeding stack entries were planted in a group block design with the stacks and parental controls grouped and randomized within the testblock, and seed samples were analyzed. A fatty acid profile for the triple fad3-1b-, fad3-1c-, mid-oleic (GM_AA22234) stack was generated with F4 field grown seed using single seed FAME. F4 fatty acid profile demonstrated approximately 68% 18:1, 13% total saturates, 16% 18:2 and 2.3% 18:3.   Oil and protein levels were similar to the parental lines<br>
[00254] Example 10 Crosses of mid-oleic, low saturate transgenic soybean with low linolenic soybean<br>
[00255] A soybean plant of a line with seeds having mid-oleic acid and low saturates level in its oil is crossed with a plant from a line with normal oleic and saturate levels but about 2.8% linolenic acid (18:3). This cross results in a soybean line producing<br>
oil with the combined properties, mid-oleic, low saturated and low linolenic fatty acid levels.<br>
[00256] Briefly, plant breeding was performed as described below. One parent line is a transgenic soybean line harboring recombinant DNA for partial suppression of the endogenous genes FAD2-1 and FATB as well as a CP4 selectable marker gene which renders the plant tolerant to glyphosate. The oil extracted from the seeds of this line contains approximately 55-85% oleic acid, up from the 20% of conventional soybean oil. It also contains less than 8% saturated fatty acids (16:0 plus 18:0), reduced from the conventional 14-16% of normal soybean oil. Another parent line is a non-transgenic variety 6p248-5 (C1640 line) which has about 3% linolenic acid levels in its seeds, as compared to the conventional 8-9% linolenic acid found in normal soybean oil. The reduction in linolenic acid is caused by a fad3-1b-/fad3-1c-double mutant. (See Wilcox, J.R. and J.F. Gavins, Inheritance of low linolenic acid content of the seed of a mutant of Glycine max., Theoretical and Applied Genetics 71:74-78, 1985.)<br>
[00257] Plants of the transgenic mid-high oleic/low saturate line are crossed with plants from the mutant line 6p248-5.   F1 seeds are produced and planted to produce selfed F2 seed. Putative triple homozygous seeds are identified from F2 seeds through single seed fatty acid methyl-ester (FAME) analysis of seed chips. Seeds with combined oil traits are identified and planted to produce selfed F3 seeds. For marker analysis, F2 leaf tissue samples are collected and established molecular markers for the FAD3 mutant alleles are used to identify double positive plants (plants having both FAD3 deletions). F3 seed lots which indicate homozygosity for the transgene locus as well as the two FAD3 mutations are selected and used for line establishment.<br>
[00258] To evaluate the field efficacy of the fad3-1b-, fad3~1c-, mid-oleic/low sat tines, the breeding stack entries are planted in a group block design with the stacks and parental controls grouped and randomized within the test block, and seed samples are analyzed. A fatty acid profile for the triple fad3-1b-, fad3-1c-, mid-oleic/low sat stack is determined with F4 field grown seed using single seed FAME. F4 fatty acid profile shows 55-85% 18:1, less than 8% saturates, and 2-3% 18:3. Oil and protein levels are similar to the parental lines.<br>
[00259] Example 11 Use of Polymorphisms at FAD3-1b<br>
[00260] To practice the methods of the invention, polymorphisms associated with the soybean FAD3-1B gene can be used to identify the presence of soybean genomic regions associated with certain low linolenic acid phenotypes. A single nucleotide polymorphism at a position corresponding to position 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61 is detected among all the lines in an entire sequence length of 2683 bp (Table 3) and is associated with a low-linolenic acid phenotype. Low-linolenic lines 6P248, T27111, T27190, T26767 and T26830 carry a "C" allele at this position while all other lines carry a "T". Consequently, the presence of a "C" allele can be used to identify the presence of the low linolenic soybean genomic regions in crosses where low linolenic germplasm derived from 6P248, T27111, T27190, T26767 and T26830 are used. Other low-linolenic lines such as A5, Soyola, and N98-4445 carry a wild type allele at this locus, indicating that one or more other loci contribute to the low-linolenic phenotype in the A5, Soyola, and N98-4445 lines.

<br>
[00262] Example 12 Identification of Polymorphisms in the FAD3-1C gene [00263] To practice the methods of the invention, polymorphisms associated with the soybean FAD3-1C gene are used to identify the presence of soybean genomic regions associated with certain low linolenic acid phenotypes. Four SNPs and one indel (insertion/deletion) are identified at FAD3-1C that are associated with certain low linolenic acid phenotypes (Table 4). The SNPs corresponding to positions 687, 2316, 3743, as well as the indel at 1129 of SEQ ID NO:62 are associated with the low-linolenic phenotype. Low-linolenic lines, Soyola and N98-4445 carry a different allele at positions 687 and 1129 from all the other lines.<br>
[00264] Mutant lines 6P248, T27111, T27190, T26767, T26830 and A5 will fail to amplify with certain FAD3-1C locus-specific primers as there is a large deletion at the FAD3-1C locus in these lines. The failure of these regions to be amplified, coupled with appropriate positive control reactions (i.e. using soybean genomic DNA that contains an intact FAD3-1C gene with FAD3-1C primers from the deleted region as well as use of primers to other non-FAD3-1C genes with the soybean genomic DNA from the FAD3-1C deletion), is diagnostic for FAD3-1C deletions.

[00266] Example 13. Identification of Soybean FAD3-1C Promoter Polymorphisms [00267] To practice the methods of the invention, polymorphisms associated with the soybean FAD3-1C promoter are used to identify the presence of soybean genomic<br>
regions associated with certain low linolenic acid phenotypes. As noted in Table 5, low linolenic lines Soyola and N98-4445 carried a different allele at all seven positions from the other wild-type lines. The presence of these polymorphisms could be used to identify the presence of Soyola or N98-4445 germplasm in crosses to wild type germplasm. [00268]Table 10.

The method of claim 36, wherein said DNA analysis technique comprises detection of a single nucleotide polymorphism in said soybean FAD3-1 B gene comprising a substitution of a thymine residue for a cytosine residue at a position in the FAD3-1 B gene sequence corresponding to nucleotide 2021 of SEQ ID NO:61.<br>
41.	The method of claim 30, wherein said transgene further comprises a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance.<br>
42.	The method of claim 34, wherein said transgene further comprises a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance and wherein said F1 soybean plant that is heterozygous for said transgene is obtained in step (i) by subjecting a plurality of F1 plants to herbicide selection for said transgene.<br>
43.	The method of claim 34, wherein said transgene further comprises a transgene that confers herbicide tolerance and wherein a plurality of F2 plants enriched for F2 soybean plants that<br>
are homozygous for said transgene are obtained in step (ii) by subjecting said plurality of F2 plants to herbicide selection for said transgene.<br>
44.	The method of claim 41, wherein said herbicide is glyphosate.<br>
45.	The method of claim 41, wherein said transgene comprises a CP4 EPSPS gene.<br>
46.	The method of claim 30, said soybean plant is made in step (a) by:<br>
<br>
a)	transforming a soybean plant or soybean plant cell comprising at least one loss-of-function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene with at least one transgene that decreases the expression of both an endogenous soybean FAD2-1 and an endogenous soybean FATB gene to obtain an Ro soybean plant with least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene that is heterozygous for said transgene;<br>
b)	selfing said Ro progeny plant from (i) to obtain an R1 soybean plant that is homozygous for said transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene, thereby obtaining a soybean plant comprising said transgene and at least one loss-of- function mutation in an endogenous soybean FAD3 gene.<br>
<br>
47.	The method of claim 46, wherein said transgene further comprises sequences that confer a herbicide tolerance trait.<br>
48.	The method of claim 47, wherein said herbicide is glyphosate.<br>
49.	The method of claim 34, further comprising the step iii) self ing said F2 progeny plant that is homozygous for said transgene and homozygous for at least one loss of function mutation in a FAD3 gene from (ii) to obtain an F3 soybean plant.<br>
50.	The method of claim 30, wherein said percentage of the total seed fatty acid content by weight of linolenic acid, saturated fatty acids and oleic acid is determined in step (c) by a lipid analysis technique.<br>
51. The method of claim 50, wherein said lipid analysis technique comprises one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of gas chromatography/flame ionization detection, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography/flame ionization detection, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization- mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy.</td>
