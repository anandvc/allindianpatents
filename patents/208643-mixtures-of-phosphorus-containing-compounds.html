MIXTURES OF PHOSPHORUS-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS<br>
The invention relates to mixtures which comprise phosphites, phosphonites. phos-phinites, in particular aromatic phosphonites or phosphites (component 1) and tertiary phosphanes (component 2) and also to a process for stabilizing polymers with respect to degradation induced by heat or by mechanical stress, using mixtures of this type.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that mixtures which comprise compounds of component 1 together with those of component 2 are more effective than the corresponding components alone as stabilizers for polymeric compounds.<br>
As is known to the person skilled in the art, phosphites, phosphonites and/or phos-phinites are used for stabilizing polymers with respect to thermooxidative degradation during their processing. The use of triphenylphosphane (triphenylphosphine; TPP) on its own has also been described in this connection. The stabilizing action of substances of this type is seen in that polymers stabilized in this way have substantially unchanged melt viscosity (this being a measure of constancy of molar mass) and also better color performance, i.e. a lower level of coloration after extrusion when compared with unstabilized polymers.<br>
If mixtures of two or more additives are used, it is to be expected that properties will change linearty as a function of their mixing ratios.<br>
However, for mixtures from the two components 1 and 2 defined above it has been found that there is an advantageous deviation from this linearity with regard to melt flow stabilization and/or color stabilization, in comparison with the linear change to be expected between the values for the individual components. This type of behavior is termed synergistic.<br>
According to the invention, a mixture is provided comprising a component 1 as constituent (a) and a component 2 as constituent (b).<br>

The amount of component 1 present in the mixtures of the invention is from 1 to 99% by weight, and that of component 2 is from 99 to 1% by weight.<br>
Preferred amounts of component 1 are from 5 to 95% by weight, particularly preferably from 10 to 90% by weight, and preferred amounts of component 2 are from 95 to 5% by weight, particularly preferably from 90 to 10% by weight.<br>
The concentration used of the mixture of the invention varies with the nature of the polymer. The person skilled in the art can readily establish the amount suitable for any given case, but typical amounts, based on the polymeric material to be stabilized, are from 0.001 to 5% by weight, preferably from 0.005 to 3% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.01 to 2% by weight.<br>
The mixtures made from components 1 and 2 may be prepared by simple mixing, by mixing in the melt, by dissolving or dispersing one component in the liquid or molten other component, by mixing two melts, or by joint melting, in each case followed, if required, by a cooling step. Mixtures of the invention are also obtained by mixing and concentrating solutions of the components in suitable solvents. The preparation of the mixtures may either be a batch process in suitable apparatus, such as a variety of mixers or reactors, etc.. or else continuous, e.g. in extruders or continuous mixers or<br><br>
kneaders or on roll mills. Compacting, pelletization. pressing, extruding, or some other method, may then be used to produce a suitable commercial form, if this is needed.<br>
The invention also provides a process for stabilizing polymeric materials with respect to thermooxidative degradation. This process encompasses the addition and incorporation of a stabilizing amount of the mixture of the invention in solid or molten form, in solution (preferably as liquid concentrate) or as a solid masterbatch (if useful) prior to. during or (usually) after the polymerization stage, in amounts such that the stabilizer concentration achieved is from 0.001 to 5% by weight, preferably from 0.005 to 3% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.01 to 2% by weight, based on the polymer to be stabilized.<br>
A liquid concentrate of this type encompasses from 10 to 80% by weight of an inventive mixture and from 90 to 20% by weight of a solvent.<br>
A masterbatch of this type (also termed a solid base-compound) encompasses from 10 to 80% by weight, preferably from 40 to 70% by weight, particularly preferably from 15 to 40% by weight, of a mixture of the invention, and from 90 to 20% by weight, preferably from 60 to 30% by weight particularly preferably from 85 to 60% by weight, of a polymeric material which is identical or compatible with the polymeric material to be stabilized.<br>
Ail of the components of the mixture of the invention may be prepared from known compounds, using known methods. An overview of reaction processes to prepare components 1 and 2 is found, for example, in G.M. Kosolapoff. Organic Phosphorus Compounds. Vols. 1-7, Wiley Verlag, New York, 1972, or in HoubenAA/eyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of organic chemistry], Vol. 12, 4th Edition, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1963, and in corresponding supplementary volumes. Using this information, the person skilled in the art can prepare the compounds described above. The content of these references is incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
Compounds of the formula (XVIII) and compounds of the formula (XIX) are also prepared by a process which encompasses reacting either a secondary phosphane of the formula R'lR'iPH or a primary phosphane of the formula R'iPH2 with a halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine, where appropriate in the presence of an acid scavenger, such as an oxide, hydroxide or carbonate of an alkali metal or of an alkaline<br><br>
earth metal, or of an amine, preferably of a tertiary amine, and where appropnate in the presence of an inert solvent. Secondary phosphanes give compounds of the formula (XVIll). Primary phosphanes give compounds of the formula (XIX). In this process it is advantageous to use alkylphosphanes as starting materials, these being more readily available on a large scale than the halophosphanes used in the prior art. Examples of detailed descriptions of this process are given in FR 2739381 or GB 2306478.<br>
Alternatively, and usually, compounds of this type are prepared from organic halides. such as alkyl or aryl chlorides, or alkyl or aryl bromides, and PCI3. via a Grignard reaction or modified Wurtz reaction; or via a Friedel-Crafts reaction; or by an addition reaction of a P-H-containing compound onto multiple bonds, or by Arbuzov reaction of organic diphosphinites with organic halides, followed by reduction, or via derivatization of previously formed phosphanes.<br>
The mixtures of the invention made from components 1 and 2 may be used as processing stabilizers for polymeric materials, preferably for<br>
1.      Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins. for example polypropylene, polyiso-<br>
butylene, polybut-1-ene. poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene. as well as polymers of cycloolefins. for example of cyclopentene or norbornene; furthermore polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked); for example, high density polyethylene (PE-HD). low-density polyethylene (PE-LD), linear low density polyethylene (PE-LLD), branched low density polyethylene (PE-BLD). Polyolefins. i.e. polymers of monoolefins, in particular polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by various, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	free-radical polymehzation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature)<br>
b)	catalytic polymerization using a catalyst that normally contains one or more metals of group IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more ligands, such as oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls. alkenyls and/or aryis that may be either TT- or o-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, for example on activated magnesium chloride, titanium chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the<br><br>
polymerization medium. The catalysts can be active as such in the polymerization or further activators may be used, for example metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides. metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, the metals being elements of groups la, Ma and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified, for example, with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips. Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta). TNZ (DuPont). metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br>
