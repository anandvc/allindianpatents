PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ALKYL BENZOYLACRYLATES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkyl benzoylacrylates.<br>
Alkyl benzoylacrylates and more particularly ethyl benzoylacrylate are useful products as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry, and more particularly for the synthesis of Enalapril. an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.<br>
Alkyl benzoylacrylates and more particularly ethyl benzoylacrylate can be prepared from benzoylacrylic acid, itself prepared from benzene and maleic anhydride (R. Delaby et al, Bull. Soc. Chim., 1961, p. 2061-64). They can also be prepared by reacting an alcoholate with<br><br>
then reacting with triphenylcarbethoxymethylenephosphorane. and finally by sulphuric hydrolysis of the product obtained (C. Raulet and E, Levas. Bull. Soc. Chim. France. 1971. nV, p. 2598-2606).<br>
EP-A-0,494.620 describes the formation of aroylacrylic esters by reacting alkyl methyl ketones with acetal-esters or hemiacetal-esters of glyoxylic acid in a strong acid medium. These acetal-esters or hemiacetal-esters can be prepared in-situ in the reaction medium by reacting glyoxylic acid with an alcohol in a strong acid medium.<br>
FR-A-2,504,127 describes the synthesis of trimethoxybenzoylacrylic acid or tri-methoxybenzoyllactic acid by condensing glyoxylic acid or one of its alkyl esters with trimethoxyacetophenone.<br>
More efficient processes for preparing alkyl benzoacrylates are always being sought.<br>
For this reason, a subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of alkyl benzoylacrylates of formula (1)<br><br><br>
in which R is an alkyl group comprising 1 to 9 carbon atoms and Ph is a phenyl radical, characterized by the fact that the reaction is carried out in an acid medium, in the same reactor (so-called "one pot" reaction), without isolation of the intermediate products, by carrying out the following operations:<br>
condensation of acetophenone with glyoxylic acid in order to obtain a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
elimination of a water/acetophenone mixture.<br>
elimination of the excess acetophenone,<br>
esterification of the compound of formula (II) with an alcohol of formula (III)<br><br>
in which R is an alkyl group comprising 1 to 9 carbon atoms, in the presence of a strong acid, in order to obtain a compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
in which R and Ph have the same meaning as previously, without isolating the intermediate product,<br>
addition of a solvent.<br>
elimination of a mixture constituted by water, solvent and an alcohol of formula<br>
(111).<br>
dehydration of the compound of formula (IV) by azeotropic distillation of water.<br>
neutralization of the strong acid by a basic aqueous solution.<br><br>
decanting and concentration of the organic phase, recovery of the sought final product of formula (1).<br>
R is a branched or preferably linear alkyl group. It preferably contains from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and in particular from 1 to 3 carbon atoms. There can be mentioned foi example the methyl, ethyl, n- and iso-propyl, n-, sec- and tert-butyl, n-pentyl radicals.<br>
Under preferential conditions for the implementation of the above process, one or more of the following operations is carried out:<br>
2 to 8 equivalents, and preferably 4 equivalents, of acetophenone are condensed with 1 equivalent of glyoxylic acid,<br>
the compound of formula (II) is esterified with 2 to 10 equivalents, preferably 3 equivalents, of an alcohol of formula (III) in the presence of a strong acid per equivalent of initial glyoxylic acid.<br>
Under other preferential conditions of the invention<br>
the alcohol of formula III used is ethanol,<br>
the strong acid used is sulphuric acid,<br>
the azeotroping solvent is toluene.<br>
the ethyl benzoyllactate is dehydrated by azeotropic distillation after adding<br>
further toluene.<br>
the basic solution used is an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate.<br>
Under other preferential implementation conditions, ethyl benzoylacrylate is prepared.<br>
The process which is a subject of the present invention allows the direct preparation of alkyl benzoylacrylate starting from acetophenone and glyoxylic acid, without the intermediate isolation of benzoyllactic acid.<br>
It is remarkably efficient in particular for the following reasons:<br>
the aldolization reaction between the acetophenone and the carbonyl function of the glyoxylic acid according to the invention produces benzoyllactic acid quantitatively<br><br><br>
and the formation of the corresponding acrylic acid is minimized,<br><br>
the esterification of the benzoyllactic acid in the presence of an alcohol and a strong acid catalysis (sulphuric acid), initially, without elimination of the water formed, which allows the esterification of the benzoyllactic acid to alkyl benzoyl-lactate<br><br>
while avoiding dehydrating the alcohol function, which in turn avoids the formation of the compound of formula<br><br>
the dehydration of the benzoyllactic acid to alkyl benzoylacrylate of formula<br><br>
minimizes the addition of alcohol on the double bond and avoids the formation of the by-product<br><br><br>
This set of conditions leads in particular to an excellent yield.<br>
The present invention also has the advantage of being able to recycle, if desired, the acetophenone introduced at the beginning of the reaction from the acetophenone-water mixture distilled during the reaction, which decants at ambient temperature.<br>
The following examples will allow a better understanding of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following are introduced into a reactor:<br>
29.6 g of 50 % glyoxylic acid in water (0.2 mole),<br>
96 g of acetophenone (0.8 mole). A heterogeneous reaction mixture is obtained the aqueous phase of which has an acid pH which is heated at 80°C under 50 millibars for 5 hours while eliminating 16.5 g of distillate comprising a water / acetophenone mixture 85/15.<br>
The vacuum is then increased progressively to 2 millibars and the reaction medium is heated at 120°C for 8 hours in order to eliminate the excess acetophenone. The composition of the medium, determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), allows the determination of a yield of benzoyllactic acid of 92 % and of benzo-ylacrylic acid of 3 %. After returning to 70°C, the medium is diluted with 28 g of absolute ethanol (0.6 mole). The reaction medium is then heated under reflux for 2 hours in the presence of 0.34 g sulphuric acid. 75 g of toluene is then added and 40 g of a mixture of solvent constituted by water (10 %), toluene (45 %) and ethanol (45 %) is eliminated. Using HPLC analysis, it is noted that the reaction medium contains a great majority of ethyl benzoyllactate. Dehydration of the ethyl benzoyllactate to ethyl benzoylacrylate is carried out by azeotropic distillation of the water after adding 50 g of fresh toluene. 5.2 g of heavy phase is then eliminated constituted by 52 % water. 45 % ethanol and 3 % toluene. After neutralization of the sulphuric acid with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, decanting and concentration of the solvents, 44 g of a yellow oil is recovered containing 81 % ethyl benzoylacrylate (cis + trans), i.e. a yield of 87 % with respect to the starting glyoxylic acid.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The following are introduced into a reactor:<br>
593.2 g of 50 % glyoxylic acid in water (4 moles).<br>
1,923 g of acetophenone (16 moles). A heterogeneous reaction mixture is obtained the aqueous phase of which has an acid pH, which is heated at SOX under 50 millibars for 5 hours while eliminating 325.3 g of distillate comprising a water / acetophenone mixture 85/15.<br>
The vacuum is then progressively increased to 2 millibars and the reaction medium is heated to 120°C for 8 hours in order to eliminate the excess acetophenone. The composition of the medium, determined by HPLC analysis, allows the determination of a yield of benzoyllactic acid of 89 % and of benzoylacrylic acid of 5 %. After returning to 70°C, the medium is diluted with 555.9 g of absolute ethanol (12 moles). The reaction medium is then heated under reflux for 2 hours in the presence of 7.1 g of sulphuric acid. 1501 g of toluene is then added and 796 g of a mixture of solvent constituted by water (9.1 %), toluene (45 %) and ethanol (46 %) is eliminated. Using HPLC analysis, it is noted that the reaction medium contains a great majority of ethyl benzoyllactate. Dehydration of the ethyl benzoyllactate to ethyl benzoylacrylate is carried out by azeo-tropic distillation of the water after adding 1213 g of fresh toluene. 110 g of heavy phase is then eliminated, constituted by approximately 50 % water and 50 % ethanol. After neutralization of the sulphuric acid using an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, decanting and concentration of the solvents, 683 g of a yellow oil is recovered containing 98.9 % ethyl benzoylacrylate (cis + trans), i.e. a yield of 83 % with respect to the starting giyoxylic acid.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
