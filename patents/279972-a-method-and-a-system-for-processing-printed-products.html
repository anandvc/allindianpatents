A METHOD AND A SYSTEM FOR PROCESSING PRINTED PRODUCTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to processing<br>
printed products and more particularly to a method and a<br>
system for processing printed products, such as books and<br>
parts thereof.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Known systems for processing printed products comprise a<br>
number of processing stations which are arranged one after<br>
another along a given processing path. The products to be<br>
processed are transported along the processing path, processed<br>
at the various processing stations and finally removed from<br>
the processing path at a removal location. A typical example<br>
of a system of this kind is disclosed in U.S. published patent<br>
application US 2002/0061238 A1 which shows, an apparatus for<br>
producing books.<br>
In systems of this type with the processing stations<br>
being fixedly arranged along a predetermined processing path<br>
(so-called "in-line systems") the processing steps have to be<br>
carried out in a predetermined sequential order defined by the<br>
mutual arrangement of the processing stations.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention, a printed<br>
product is fed to a first infeeding location of a transfer<br>
station, then transported in any sequence from the transfer<br>
station to one of a number of processing stations connected to<br>
the transfer station and processed at the respective<br>
processing station. The processed printed product is<br>
transported back to the transfer station after completion of<br>
the processing step at one of the processing stations.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a printed product fed to a first infeeding location<br>
of a transfer station is moved within the transfer station to<br>
a first outfeeding location of the transfer station. From this<br>
first outfeeding location the printed product is transported<br>
to a first processing station connected to the transfer<br>
station. At this first processing station the printed product<br>
is processed. After being processed at this first processing<br>
station, the printed product is transported back to a first<br>
receiving location of the transfer station. The processed<br>
printed product is then moved within the transfer station to a<br>
first removal location of the transfer station and finally<br>
removed from the transfer station at the first removal<br>
location.<br>
Preferably the processed printed product infed to the<br>
first receiving location of the transfer station is<br>
subsequently transported to further processing stations<br>
connected to the transfer station and processed in these<br>
further processing stations. After completion of the<br>
processing step in one of the processing stations the<br>
processed printed product is transported back to the transfer<br>
station.<br>

 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
In a still further embodiment the printed product is<br>
temporarily stored or buffered in the transfer station between<br>
the various processing steps carried out at the further<br>
processing stations.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention a system for<br>
processing printed products comprises a transfer station which<br>
is provided with at least a first infeeding location for<br>
infeeding printed products to the transfer station, at least a<br>
first removal location for removing processed printed products<br>
from the transfer station and at least a first connecting<br>
location. A first processing station is operatively connected<br>
to this first connecting location of the transfer device. The<br>
transfer station is further provided with a transporting<br>
device for moving the printed products within the transfer<br>
device between the first infeeding location, the first<br>
connecting location and the first removal location.<br>
According to a still further embodiment of the present<br>
invention a system for processing printed products comprises a<br>
transfer station which is provided with at least a first<br>
infeeding location for infeeding printed products to the<br>
transfer station, at least a first removal location for<br>
removing processed printed products from the transfer station<br>
and a number of connecting locations. A processing station is<br>
operatively connected to each of the connecting locations.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention the transfer<br>
station comprises buffer means for temporarily storing printed<br>
products. Preferably these buffer means comprise shelving<br>
means for temporarily shelving printed products.<br>
In general the present invention provides for a central<br>
transfer station to which the articles to be processed are<br>
fed. A number of processing stations are connected to the<br>
transfer station. The articles fed to the transfer station are<br>
- 3 -<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
transported in sequence to the various processing stations.<br>
After termination of the processing step in a particular<br>
processing station, the articles are always transported back<br>
to the transfer station and from there to the next processing<br>
station or to a removal location. The transfer station serves<br>
as a kind of interchange for the processing stations.<br>
The method and the system for processing printed products<br>
according to the present invention provides for many different<br>
production paths along which the products to be processed can<br>
be moved. This results in a great flexibility in the sequence<br>
of the various processing operations. This means that the<br>
sequence of the various steps in the processing of a printed<br>
product can easily be optimized.<br>
The printed products can anytime be buffered or<br>
temporarily stored in the transfer station until the products<br>
are needed for the next processing step or the removal.<br>
The system can still operate even if a processing station<br>
is temporarily out of service.<br>

WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the basic concept of a system for<br>
processing printed products and other articles according to<br>
the present invention. As shown in this Fig. 1 such a system<br>
comprises a transfer station 1 which is provided with an<br>
infeeding location 2, a number of connecting locations 3, 4, 5<br>
and a removal location 6. A delivery station 7 is connected to<br>
the infeeding location 2 and delivers printed products to be<br>
fed to the transfer station 1. Processing stations 8, 9 and 10<br>
are connected to an associated connecting location 3, 4, 5,<br>
respectively. These processing stations 8, 9, 10 receive<br>
printed products from the transfer station 1 and process these<br>
printed products. After the completion of the processing step<br>
in one of these processing stations 8, 9, 10, the processed<br>
printed products are transported back to the transfer station<br>
1. An output station 11 is connected to the removal location 6<br>
and receives the processed printed products from the transfer<br>
station 1.<br>
The basic mode of operation of the system shown in Fig. 1<br>
is an follows:<br>
A printed product (or another article to be processed) is<br>
fed to the infeeding location 2 of the transfer device 1. The<br>
product is then moved within the transfer station 1 to a first<br>
connecting location, e.g. to connecting location 3. From this<br>
first connecting location 3 the printed product is transported<br>
to the processing station connected to the first connecting<br>
location, i.e. in our example to processing station 8. After<br>
the processing step in said processing station 8 is finished,<br>
the processed printed product is fed back to the transfer<br>
station 1. If no further processing is required, the finished<br>
printed product is moved within the transfer station 1 to the<br>
removal location 6 and from there to the output station 11. In<br>
case the printed product needs further processing, the product<br>
is moved within the transfer station to a second connecting<br>
- 6 -<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
location, e.g. to connecting location 5, then transported to<br>
the associated processing station, in our example to<br>
processing station 10, processed in this processing station<br>
and subsequently transported back to the transfer station 1.<br>
If a further processing of the printed product is required,<br>
the latter is moved to a third connecting location, in our<br>
example to connecting location 4, processed in the associated<br>
processing station (processing station 9) and then moved back<br>
to the transfer station 1. The finished processed product is<br>
then moved within the transfer station 1 to the removal<br>
location 6 and from there to the output station 11.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the printed product fed to<br>
the infeeding location 2 is directly moved within the transfer<br>
station 1 to the removal location 6. In this embodiment no<br>
processing of the infed printed product takes place.<br>
If required, the printed products can temporarily be<br>
buffered or stored within the transfer station 1 between the<br>
processing steps carried out at the various processing<br>
stations as well as after being infed to the transfer station<br>
1 or prior to the removal from the transfer station 1.<br>
Since all the processing stations 8, 9, 10 are connected<br>
to the transfer station 1 which serves as a kind of<br>
interchange for the processing stations 8, 9, 10 the products<br>
to be processed can be fed to the various processing stations<br>
in any possible sequence or order. In other words, the<br>
products can for example be processed first in the processing<br>
station 8, then in the processing station 9 and finally in the<br>
processing station 10.<br>
Alternatively the printed product can first be processed<br>
in the processing station 10, then in the processing station 8<br>
and finally in the processing station 9 without changing the<br>
7 -<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
physical layout of the system. It is also possible to route<br>
the product through only part of the processing stations.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the system consists of a dynamic<br>
system allowing for the production of books with virtually no<br>
setup costs, totally automated production, high level of<br>
reliability as a system (without the single point of failure<br>
inherent to an inline system), high throughput, and the<br>
ability to easily add or modify processes.<br>
The system starts with the software that accepts orders<br>
and sends the jobs to be produced to the print engines. The<br>
information on the job is contained in the software, as is<br>
various methods for tracking the product through the<br>
production process. Multiple print engines are used to gain<br>
high levels of throughput with high print quality (high<br>
quality is preferred in most cases, but not needed in some<br>
cases).<br>
The print engines are connected by very fast robots<br>
(typically on a track, to allow for the highest speed and<br>
precision) allowing for any number of print engines to be<br>
connected to multiple finishing devices (although it could be<br>
multiple print engines to one finishing device, or one print<br>
engine to multiple finishing devices). When the book block is<br>
finished, the robot accepts the book from each print engine<br>
and brings it to the next step in the production process. The<br>
process of bringing it from one step to another can be<br>
repeated multiple times, until the final step of the robot<br>
bringing it to the completion area, which in most cases is a<br>
shipping station (it could be an inventory area, or many other<br>
locations).<br>

WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
Figures 2-5 show an embodiment of the system<br>
represented in Fig. 1 in greater detail. In Figs. 2-5 the<br>
same reference numerals are used as in Fig. 1 for like<br>
structural elements.<br>
The system shown in Fig. 2 comprises also a transfer<br>
station 1, which is shown in greater detail in Figs. 3-5.<br>
This transfer station 1 comprises a first infeeding location<br>
2, first, second and third connecting locations 3, 4, 5<br>
respectively and a first removal location 6 - as the transfer<br>
station 1 of the system shown in Fig. 1. In addition thereto,<br>
the system of Fig. 2 is provided with a second infeeding<br>
location 12 and a second removal location 17. As in the system<br>
shown in Fig. 1 a first delivery station 7 is connected to the .<br>
first infeeding location 2. First, second and third<br>
processing stations 8, 9, 10 are connected to the connecting<br>
locations 3, 4, 5, respectively. An output station 11 is<br>
connected to the first removal location 6.<br>
A second delivery station 13 is connected to the second<br>
infeeding location 12 of the transfer station 1. A conveyor<br>
device 18 is connected to the second removal location 17. This<br>
conveying device 18 serves to remove the printed products<br>
leaving the transfer station 1 at the second removal location<br>
12. .<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 the first, second and third connecting<br>
locations 3, 4, 5, respectively, comprise an outfeeding<br>
location 14 and a receiving location 15. The third connecting<br>
location 5 has a second outfeeding location 14'. The printed<br>
products transported from the transfer station 11 to a<br>
processing station 8, 9, 10 are leaving the transfer station 1<br>
at an outfeeding location 14, 14'. The printed products<br>
processed in a processing station 8, 9, 10 are fed back to the<br>
transfer station 1 at the associated receiving location 15.<br>

WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
Further shown in Fig. 2 is a supply station 16 connected<br>
to the first processing station 8.<br>
As mentioned earlier the construction of the transfer<br>
station 1 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 3-5.<br>
The elongated transfer station 1 has a central shelve 19<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction of the transfer<br>
station 1. This shelve 19 is divided into a number of<br>
compartments 19a. Each compartment 19a is-provided with a<br>
number of storage locations 20 arranged one upon another. The<br>
compartments 19a of the shelve 19 are accessible from both<br>
sides.<br>
The transfer station 1 further comprises handling devices<br>
21, 22, 23, 24 arranged on both sides of the shelve 19. The<br>
handling devices 21 and 22 are provided on one side of the<br>
shelve 19 and are travelling along a linear track 25 extending<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the shelve 19. The handling<br>
devices 23 and 24 are located on the other side of the shelve<br>
19 and are also travelling along a linear track 26 extending<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the shelve 19. Each handling<br>
device 21, 22, 23, 24 is provided with a drive system (not<br>
shown) for moving the associated handling device 21, 22, 23,<br>
24 along the track 25, 26, respectively.<br>
It is evident that only one handling device or even more<br>
than two handling devices can be arranged on each side of the<br>
shelve 19.<br>
The handling devices 21, 22, 23, 24 take over the printed<br>
products at an infeeding location 2, 12 or at a receiving<br>
location 15, move the products within the transfer station 1<br>
and release the products at a removal location 6, 17 or at an<br>
outfeeding location 14. If a buffering or storing of a product<br>
is required, the handling devices 21, 22, 23, 24 place the<br>
- 10 -<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
product- into a storage location 20 of the shelve 19 and remove<br>
the stored products from the shelve 19.<br>
Each handling device 21, 22, 23, 24 is provided with at<br>
least one releasable gripper for seizing the printed products.<br>
The shelve 19 and the handling devices 21, 22, 23, 24 are<br>
enclosed in a housing 27 (Fig. 5).<br>
The mode of operation of the system shown in Figs. 2-5<br>
is the same as the mode of operation already explained in<br>
connection with Fig. 1. This means that the printed products<br>
fed to the transfer station at the infeeding locations 2, 12<br>
are moved within the transfer station 1 to the outfeeding<br>
location 14 assigned to a first processing station 8, 9 or 10.<br>
After completion of the processing operation the printed<br>
product is moved back to the associated receiving location of<br>
the transfer station 1 and moved within the transfer station 1<br>
to either a removal location 6, 17 or to a second outfeeding<br>
location 14 assigned to a second processing station 8, 9 or<br>
10. Prom this second processing station the processed printed<br>
product is transported back to the related receiving location<br>
15 and then either moved within the transfer station 1 to a<br>
removal location 6, 17 or - in the manner as explained earlier<br>
- to the third processing station 8, 9 or 10.<br>
If required the products are temporarily stored or<br>
buffered in the shelve 19 between the various processing<br>
operations or after the infeeding or before the removal. The<br>
transport of the products within the transfer station 1 is<br>
taken over by the handling devices 21, 22, 23 and 24 as<br>
explained earlier.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the system shown in Figs .2-5<br>
is used for processing or producing books. In this embodiment<br>
the delivery stations 7 and 13 are printing stations and the<br>
- 11 -<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
output station 11 is a packaging station, whereas the first<br>
 processing station 8 is a binding station, the second<br>
processing station 9 a trimming station and the third<br>
processing station 10 a shrink wrapping station. The supply-<br>
station 16 delivers book covers to the binding station 8.<br>
The printing units 7, 13 are used for printing book<br>
blocks which are transferred to the transfer station 1 and<br>
then transported to the binding station 8. In this binding<br>
station 8 the covers supplied by the supply station 16 and the<br>
book blocks are bound together. The bound components are then<br>
transferred back to the transfer station 1 and then<br>
transported to the trimming station 9, where excess margins<br>
are cut. The books processed in the trimming station 9 are<br>
transferred back to the transfer station 1 and then either<br>
transported to the removal location 6 in order to be packed in<br>
the packaging station 11 or fed to the shrink wrapping station<br>
10 and from the latter back to the transfer station 1. The<br>
shrink wrapped books are then either transported to the first<br>
removal location 6 for packaging or to the second removal<br>
location 17 for being transported away by the conveying device<br>
18.<br>
The book blocks delivered to the transfer station 1 by<br>
the printing stations 7, 13 can be stored in the shelve 19<br>
prior to being transported to the binding station 8. Equally<br>
the bound components transported back to the transfer station<br>
1 can be temporarily stored in the shelve 19 prior to being<br>
delivered to the trimming station 9 and/or the shrink wrapping<br>
station 10. The finished books can also be temporarily stored<br>
in the shelve 19 prior to the removal at the removal locations<br>
6 and 17.<br>
It is understood that additional processing stations can<br>
be provided, e.g. a drilling station for drilling holes or an<br>
- 12 -<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008434	PCT/US2006/025279<br>
inserting station for inserting products, such as for example<br>
CDs, into the books.<br>
The system shown in Pigs. 1-5 allows for a great<br>
flexibility in the order or sequence the various processing<br>
steps are carried out. Furthermore, any number of processing<br>
stations, infeeding locations and removal locations is<br>
possible.<br>
Various modifications of the system shown and described<br>
above are conceivable, a few of which will now be referred to.<br>
If required the products fed to the transfer station 1<br>
can be moved directly to a removal location 6, 17 without<br>
undergoing a processing operation in one or more of the<br>
processing stations 8, 9, 10.<br>
The product processed in a processing station can be<br>
transported away directly from this particular processing<br>
station without first being transported back to the transfer<br>
station 1.<br>
The transfer station 1 itself can be of a construction<br>
different from the one shown in Figs. 2-5.<br>
The shelve 19 of the transfer station 1 can be designed<br>
to be open only at one side which results in a shelve 19 which<br>
is accessible from one side only.<br>
Instead of the handling devices 21, 22, 23, 24 other<br>
suitable systems for transporting the products within the<br>
transfer station 1 are possible. For example a conveying<br>
system can be used which comprises one or more conveyors<br>
equipped with controllable grippers for seizing the printed<br>
products.<br>
