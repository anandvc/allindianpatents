				<td>CLOTHING VENTILATION DEVICE ALLOWING THE HUMAN<br>
BODY TO BREATHE, AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a ventilation device to be applied to items<br>
of clothing in order to allow the human body to breathe.<br>
The invention also relates to the method for producing the device.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is known that people wear shoes and clothing mainly to protect<br>
themselves from weather and the cold.<br>
Depending on the external temperature and on the environmental<br>
conditions, it is necessary to resort to various "layers" of clothing in order to<br>
adapt the body to the surrounding environment.<br>
This protection system allows, in particular, to easily adapt the body to<br>
the thermal variations that can occur simply by adding or removing one or<br>
more layers of clothing.<br>
The human body inherently has a series of "mechanisms" that allow it to<br>
adapt thermally to the surrounding environment.<br>
In case of overheating, the body, in fact, reacts by increasing perspiration,<br>
which by evaporating ensures a natural lowering of the temperature of the<br>
body.<br>
However, if the water vapor is unable to escape from the layers of<br>
clothing in which the human body is wrapped, humidity increases and the<br>
vapor condenses, returning to the liquid state of perspiration and thus<br>
wetting the clothes starting from the ones that constitute the first layer<br>
(underwear).<br>
The only solution to this drawback is to replace as quickly as possible the<br>
wet item with a dry one, with the risk, however, of subjecting the body to<br>
sudden chilling.<br>
A breathable item of clothing has recently been devised which is<br>
disclosed in Italian Patent Application PD99A000149 of July 6, 1999 and in<br><br>
the corresponding W0 J01/01803 A1 and comprises a protective outer<br>
enclosure with an internal layer that affects at least part of the extension of<br>
said outer enclosure and defines internally an interspace.<br>
The inner layer has, at least at the regions of the human body where sweat<br>
forms most abundantly, holes for access to said interspace for the vapor<br>
produced by sweating.<br>
The inner layer and the outer enclosure have, in the top regions of the<br>
item, holes for the evacuation of the vapor that is conveyed by a "stack<br>
effect" inside said interspace, combined with means that hold out water,<br>
impurities or other substances.<br>
The means that hold out water is constituted by a membrane that is<br>
permeable to vapor and/or air, impermeable to water, arranged in the upper<br>
regions where the vapor exit holes are formed, and interposed between said<br>
outer enclosure and said inner layer.<br>
As an alternative, the means that hold out the water is constituted by a<br>
ventilation element that is provided with means for fixing to the fabric of an<br>
item of clothing at an appropriately provided opening.<br>
The ventilation element has, at the part to be arranged externally, an<br>
orientation that slopes from the center toward the peripheral region and a top<br>
opening.<br>
An external protective dome, raised substantially from the ventilation<br>
element, is fixed perimetrically thereto and has, in a position other than the<br>
central one, at least one hole that is not aligned with the central opening.<br>
Although said means that hold out water have been found to be<br>
functional, even in the other embodiments disclosed in Italian Patent<br>
Application PD99A000149 of July 6, 1999 and in the corresponding WO<br>
01/01803 Al, they have been found to have drawbacks, including difficulties<br>
in manufacture and/or production, but most of all their resulting or inherent<br>
color is hardly comparable to the color of the item, and this causes<br>
considerable problems in terms of visual impact, which is fundamental for<br>
marketability.<br>
An equally important factor is high cost.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a ventilation<br>
device of the type suitable to be applied to items of clothing that allows<br>
breathing, at the same time ensuring the fullest impermeability to water and<br>
a visual impact that is distinctly better than the impact obtained with known<br>
devices.<br>
Within this aim, an object to be achieved with the present invention is to<br>
provide a ventilation device that allows in every respect the natural<br>
thermoregulation of the human body.<br>
Another object is to obtain a ventilation device that is structurally very<br>
simple to provide.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a ventilation device<br>
that is easy to apply to any type of item of clothing.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a ventilation device to be applied to items of<br>
clothing, characterized in that it comprises:<br>
~ an assembly with through holes, composed of a band of material that is<br>
at least partially transparent and impermeable and is provided to be arranged<br>
externally, a layer provided to be placed in view and made of natural or<br>
synthetic fabric, natural or synthetic leather or equivalents, at least one layer<br>
of adhesive polymeric material for joining one another said outer band and<br>
said layer to be placed in view, between which is inserted:<br>
— a membrane which is impermeable to water and permeable to vapor,<br>
provided for being arranged intemally, and sealed at least perimetrically to<br>
said assembly on the side of said layer to be placed in view.<br>
Advantageously, between said assembly and said membrane there is a<br>
layer of open-cell expanded plastic material.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become better apparent from the description of an embodiment thereof<br>
illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a portion of the device according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the components of the device<br>
of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of the device in a step of its production;<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view of the device in a step of its production that<br>
follows the step of Figure 3.<br>
Wavs to carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, a preferred embodiment of a ventilation<br>
device according to the present invention is generally designated by the<br>
reference numeral 10.___<br>
The ventilation device 10 comprises an assembly 11 with through holes<br>
12 (in order to allow the passage of vapor) composed of a band 13 made of<br>
at least partially transparent and impermeable material to be arranged<br>
externally, a layer 14 to be placed in view, preferably of the same type as the<br>
one that constitutes the item of clothing (not shown) on which the device is<br>
applied, therefore for example natural or synthetic fabric, natural or synthetic<br>
leather or equivalents, joined by applying heat to said band 13 by means of<br>
at least one layer 15 made of heat-sealing polymeric material inserted<br>
between them.<br>
The layer 15 preferably has a thickness in the order of 0.1 mm and is<br>
made of a material that is compatible with the material of the band 11 and<br>
with the requirements of, for example, high-frequency bonding (cited<br>
hereafter) and therefore with a low melting point.<br>
Advantageously, in this case the material can be constituted by PU.<br>
As an alternative, the layer 15 can be constituted by a coating or spread of<br>
an adhesive that can be reactivated by pressure or heat.<br>
The function of the band 13 is also to avoid unraveling of the fabric of the<br>
layer 14 to be placed in view after the provision of the holes 12.<br>
The band must also be made of a material that is compatible with high-<br>
frequency bonding, for example PVC, if this type of bonding is subsequently<br>
adopted.<br>
A membrane 16 that is impermeable to water and permeable to vapor<br>
(such as expanded PTFE and/or hydrophilic polymer), to be arranged<br>
internally, is sealed at least perimetrically by high-frequency bonding to the<br>
assembly 11 on the side of said layer 14.<br>
Alternatively, sealing can also be performed by thermoformation (hot<br>
pressing in molds) or with another suitable means.<br>
Conveniently, the membrane 16 can be laminated together with a<br>
supporting layer (mesh) 17, which in this case is shown at the inner part but<br>
can also be arranged toward the outside.<br>
The membrane 16 can also be laminated with protective materials (not<br>
shown), which are in any case placed toward the inside.<br>
Advantageously, between the layer 14 to be placed in view and the<br>
membrane 16 there is a layer 18 made of open-cell expanded plastic<br>
material, which is capable of creating a space for separating them in order to<br>
allow better passage of the vapory, "<br>
The layer 18 can also be used to produce a padding effect and, through<br>
the high-frequency bonding that produces compressed and expanded<br>
regions, provide on the outside decorations, designs, markings, et cetera.<br>
As regards the production process, it provides for the following steps:<br>
-- the band 13 is coupled by continuous or discontinuous<br>
thermoformation to the layer 14, to be placed in view, by means of the layer<br>
15;<br>
- the through holes 12 are formed through the assembly 11, which has<br>
the appearance shown in Figure 3;<br>
— the membrane 16, optionally together with the mesh 17, is joined to the<br>
assembly 11 (optionally with the layer 18 inserted between them), by high-<br>
frequency bonding (Figure 4).<br>
In practice it has been found that the present invention has achieved more<br>
than satisfactorily the intended aim and objects.<br>
A considerable advantage has been achieved by the present invention in<br>
that a ventilation device has been provided which is suitable to be applied to<br>
items of clothing, and allows maximum breathing and at the same time<br>
ensures the fullest impermeability to water and is therefore particularly<br>
suitable for all items in which waterproofness is a fundamental prerogative.<br>
It should be noted that the band 13 (which is transparent) places the layer<br>
14 in view, and this gives the assembly an excellent visual impact.<br>
Another very important advantage has been achieved in that a ventilation<br>
device has been provided which ensures, in every respect, the natural<br>
thermoregulation of the human body.<br>
Moreover, one should consider the fact that the ventilation device devised<br>
with the present invention is structurally very simple to provide.<br>
It is also worth pointing out the fact that the ventilation device that has<br>
been devised is easy to apply to any type of item of clothing.<br>
All the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br>
The materials used, so long as they are compatible with the contingent<br>
use, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to requirements.<br>
