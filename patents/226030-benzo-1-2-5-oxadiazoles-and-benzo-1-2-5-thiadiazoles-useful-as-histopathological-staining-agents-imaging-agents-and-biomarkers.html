BenzoM.2,51oxadiazotes and Benzof1,2,5"lthiadiazoles useful as Histopatholoqical Staining Agents, Imaging Agents and Biomarkers<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzo[1,2,5]oxadiazoies and benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazoles, their preparation, their use as markers and compositions containing them.<br>
More particularly the invention provides a compound of formula I<br><br>
wherein X is 0 or S, R, is 5-(2-fluoro-ethylaminoMhiazol-2-yl, 5-(2-18F-ethyIamino)-thiazol-2-yl or a group of formula (a)<br><br>
wherein Y is CH or N, R2 is NHCH3, NH11CH3, N(CH3)11CH3, N(CH3)2) N(11CH3)2, NH(CH2)nF, NH(CH2)n18F, N(CH3MCH2)nF, N(CH3MCH2)n18F, 0-(CH2)nF, O-(CH2)n18F, CONH(CH2)nF or CONH(CH2)n18F (n being in each case 2 to 4) and R3 is hydroxy, (C1-4)alkoxy, hydrogen or nitro, in free base or add addition salt form.<br>
The term (C1-4)a!koxy as used herein relates to a radical comprising an alkyl moiety with from and including 1 up to and including 4 C atoms and is linear or branched; preferably (C1-4)alkoxy is methoxy, ethoxy or n-propoxy.<br>
Natural occurring carbon consists of the isotopes 12C (98.90%), 13C (1.10 %) and traces of 14C. The term "11C" denotes that a higher ratio of the respective carbon atoms in a radical or moiety correspond to 11C isotopes as compared to natural occurring carbon, especially a radical or moiety wherein at least 25 %, preferably at least 90 %, more preferably at least 95 %, of the carbon atoms are 11C isotopes.<br><br>
The 11C isotope can be prepared by methods known as such. Since the half-life period is short (about 20 min), the isotope needs to be freshly prepared shortly before usage in reagents by employment of a cyclotron. The methylation reaction using 11C-methyl iodide is the most used reaction in 11C labelling synthesis. A suitable method is based on the reduction of trapped 11C-carbon dioxide with lithium aluminumhydride in tetrahydrofuran, followed by removal of solvent. Hydroiodic acid is added and the formed 11C-methyl iodide distilled in a stream of nitrogen gas to the reaction flask.<br>
Natural occurring fluorine consists of the isotope 19F (100 %). The term "18F" denotes that a higher ratio of the respective fluorine atoms in a radical or moiety correspond to 18F isotope as compared to natural occurring fluorine, especially a radical or moiety wherein at least 25 %, preferably at least 90 %, more preferably at least 95 %, of the fluorine atoms are 18F isotopes.<br>
The 18F isotope can be prepared by methods known as such. Since the half-life period is short (about 110 min), the isotope needs to be freshly prepared shortly before usage in reagents by employment of a cyclotron. 1GF can be obtained, e.g., by irradiating a target containing 180-H20 with a proton beam, in a cyclotron. In this process, 18F is obtained from the 180(p,n) 18F nuclear reaction and used immediately to generate final radiomarkers as described, e.g. in "Fundamentals of Positron Emission tomography and Applications in Preclinical Drug Development", Simon R Cherry, J Clin Pharmacol 2001; 41:482-491, and the references cited therein, which publication is included in the present patent filing by reference.<br>
For diagnostic purposes, those compounds of formula I are preferred comprising 11C or 18F.<br>
in a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of the compounds of formula I and their salts, comprising the steps of<br>
a)   for the production of a compound of formula I which contains no 11C or 18F atom, reacting a compound of formula II<br><br><br>
wherein X is as defined above and Hal is CI, Br or I, with 5-(2-fluoro-ethy!amino)thiazoIyl-2-boronic acid or a compound of formula II)<br><br>
wherein Y and R3 are as defined above and R2 is a group R2 as defined above which contains no 11C or 18F atom, or<br>
b)	for the production of a compound of formula I wherein R, is 5-(2-1BF-ethylarnino)-thiazol-2-yl, reacting a compound of formula I wherein Ri is 5-(2-mesyioxy-ethylarninoHhiazoI-2-yl or 5-(24osyloxy-ethylamino)-thiazol-2-yl with 18Fe, or<br>
c)	for the production of a compound of formula I wherein R2 is NH11CH3l N(CH3)11CH3 or N(11CH3)£f reacting a compound of formula I wherein R2 is NH2 or NHCH3 with 11CH3I, or<br>
d)	for the production of a compound of formula I wherein R2 is NH(CH2)n18F, N(CH3)-<br>
(CH2)n18F, 0-(CH2)n18F or CONH(CH2)n18F, reacting a compound of formula I wherein R2<br>
is, respectively, NH(CH2)nOTs or NH(CH2)nOMs, N(CH3HCH2)nOTs or N(CH3HCH2)n-<br>
OMs, 0-(CH2)nOTs or ©-(CH^-OF^s, or CONH(CH2)nOTs or CONHCCH^OMs, with iBpe<br>
and recovering the resulting compound of formula I in free base form or in form of an acid addition salt.<br>
The reaction described under a) can be effected according to known methods, for example as described in Example 1.<br><br>
Alternatively to process a), conventional methods can be used for the production of compounds of formula I which contain no 11C or 18F atom, for example as described in Examples 4, 7 and 13 to 25.<br>
The reactions described under b)f c) and d) can be effected according to conventional methods.<br>
Working up the reaction mixtures and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures.<br>
Acid addition salts may be produced from the free bases in known manner, and vice-versa.<br>
The agents of the invention have a high affinity to li-amyloid deposits, especially extracellular ft-amyloid deposits, and bind to these deposits by means of physical or chemical interaction. Hence, the agents of the invention can be used in the therapy or diagnosis of diseases wherein such S-amyloid deposits are observed, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Preferably, the agents of the invention are used in diagnosis.<br>
In particular, compounds of formula I in free base or acid addition salt form, hereinafter referred to as agents of the invention, exhibit valuable properties as histopathological staining agents, imaging agents and/or biomarkers, hereinafter "markers".<br>
More particularly, the agents of the invention are useful as markers for labeling pathological structures such as extracellular IS-amyloid deposits, e.g. in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (see Example 26).<br>
The agents of the invention are therefore useful for the early diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and for monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic treatments of<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The advantages of assessing amyloid deposits in vivo and non-invasively using markers capable of labeling these structures have been reported e.g. in WO 00/10614, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In accordance with the above, the present invention provides a composition for labeling histopathologic^! structures in vivo or in vitro, comprising an agent of the invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for labeling histopathological structures in vitro or in vivo, which comprises contacting brain tissue with an agent of the invention.<br>
Said brain tissue comprises for example B-amyloid deposits.<br>
Contacting the brain tissue with the agent of the invention is for example effected by administering the agent of the invention to a patient, e.g. a patient with Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The method of the invention may comprise a further step aimed at determining whether the agent of the invention labeled the target structure.<br>
If the agent of the invention is a non-radioactive compound of formula I, said further step may be effected by observing the target structure using fluorescence microscopy.<br>
If the agent of the invention is a radioactive compound of formula I, said further step may be effected by observing the target structure using positron emission tomography (PET).<br>
Labeling histopathological structures in vitro is effected, for example, for detecting histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Labeling histopathological structures in vivo is effected, for example, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in a patient or for monitoring the effectiveness of a therapeutic treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In further aspects, the present invention relates to<br>
•	the use of a compound of formula I for the manufacture of a preparation for the treatment or diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease;<br>
•	a package comprising a compound of formula I wherein R2 is NH2 or NHCH3 together with instructions for the production of a compound of formula ! wherein R2 is<br><br><br><br>
