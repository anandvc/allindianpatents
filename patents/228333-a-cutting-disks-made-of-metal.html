				<td>The present invention relates to a <br>
 cutting discd made of metal and to a cutting disc presenting<br><br>
this vibration dumping sheet.<br>
Diamond discs are known, comprising a steel or aluminium discs on whose peripheral area is secured, by means of known welding technique, a crown of diamond covered plates. Said discs are made to rotate at a high number of rotations per minute and are used to cut the most disparate products such as rocks, concrete, tiles made of any material and construction materials in general.<br>
Also known are steel discs for cutting wood, glass, iron, which present a peripheral crown of teeth conformed as a saw or with plates of hard metal, such as vidia, secured thereon. It has been noted that traditional steel or aluminium cutting discs, be they intended for construction materials or for iron, wood, etc., develop magnetic and sound waves which cause vibrations.<br>
The vibrations, in addition to creating a deafening noise, considerably influence the operating temperature of the disc and thus greatly reduce its mechanical resistance. Said discs are subject to different kinds of deformations which lead to the breakage or detachment of the diamond plates or of the teeth with the consequent considerable risk for the operator and for the treated product.<br>
The abstract of the Japanese patent application No. 5161526 shows a base board obtained by laminating plural carbon fabric fibres. By fixing on said base board a layer of superabrasive gain is formed a superabrasive grain grinding wheel. The use of carbon fibres layers is in connection with the aim to obtain a rigid base having an even displacement in all directions during<br>
the grinding.<br><br>
The US Patent No. 5408983 shows a saw which has not, as usual, a steel blade, but a blade which is composed of a synthetic plastic material reinforced with a fiber material composed of a plurality of fibers selected from the group consisting of carbon fibers and graphite fibers with a volume fraction of 30-70%. The presence of the carbon fibers and of the graphite fibers should give the necessary rigidity to the synthetic plastic material.<br>
The European patent No. 0523260 shows a saw blade for circular saws or cutting discs composed of synthetic plastic material reinforced with fibers. The presence of the fibers should render more rigid the blade composed of synthetic plastic material. For this purpose the fibers are embedded in the synthetic plastic material according to a radial orientation which is uniformly distributed along the edge of the body.<br>
The US Patent No. 3793783 shows a grinding wheel having identical, interchangeable and replaceable cut-off segments. Every segment has a composite structure composed of a thin base member, an abrasive member and of at least a layer of reinforcing material. The structure of said wheel should allow easy re-use when some abrasive segments are weared out and they should be replaced.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to eliminate or rather stop the formation of said waves and thereby prevent the known disc made of steel or metal from experiencing overheating phenomena.<br>
Another aim is to improve, in the case of diamond discs, the work of the diamond both from the standpoint of the cut and of execution times.<br><br>
This and other aims are all attained by the vibration damping sheet. The damping sheet in particular comprises one or more layers of fabric made of carbon fiber or carbon fiber combined with other synthetic fibres such as glass or glass fibre alone, on at least one face of said sheet being applied a<br>
layer of adhesive suitable stably to secure said sheet to the steel or metal<br>
j disc, and by the cutting disc.<br>
According to the present invention a vibration damping sheet (1) for cutting discs made of metal and having on their peripheral area abrasive elements (10) which are able to cut an object when the cutting disc is made to rotate at a high number of rotations, the vibration damping sheet,comprises one or more layers (3) of carbon fibre fabric, characterized in that on a face of said vibration damping sheet (1) is provided a layer of adhesive (4) able to adhere to the surface of the metal cutting disc (11).<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a cutting disc made of metal (11), having on his peripheral area a crown of diamond covered plates or teeth which are able to cut an object when the cutting disc is made to rotate at a high number of rotation, characterized in that it comprises on both faces a vibration damping sheet,which comprises one or more layers (3) of carbon fiber fabric, on a face of said vibration damping sheet (1) being provided a layer of adhesive (4) able to adhere to the surface of the metal cutting disc (11).<br>
This and other features will become more readily apparent from the description that follows of a preferred form of embodiment illustrated, purely by way of non limiting example, in the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows the circular shaped sheet in a perspective view;<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a cross section of the sheet and the cutting disc.<br>
With reference to the figures, the number 1 indicates in its entirely a circular shaped sheet with a central hole 2.<br>
The sheet is formed by one or more layers 3 of carbon fibre fabric to form an overall thickness of 2-8 tenths of millimetre, in any case of such thickness as not to exceed the thickness of the diamond plate 10 or of the tooth of a metal disc 11 whereto said sheet shall be applied.<br>
On at least one of the two faces of the sheet, an adhesive layer 4 is applied, covered with a sheet 5 of paper or hardboard. Removing the hardboard 5, the sheet 1 can be attached to one of the faces of the steel disc thereby forming a single body therewith. Another sheet 1 must be applied to the other face of the disc.<br>
The thickness of the sheet 1 and the type of fibre employed for its realisation shall be determined according to the type of metal whereof the disc is made and also to its operative application.<br>
Each layer of fabric can alternatively be realised with carbon fibre combined with glass fibre or with carbon fibre mixed with Kevlar fibre.<br>
Alternatively, each fabric layer can be entirely made of glass fibre.<br>
In the case of fabric combined fibres, the carbon fibres can be oriented differently from the orientation of the glass of Kevlar fibres.<br>
Since the diameters of cutting discs have been standardised,<br><br>
'the sheet may have a diameter equal to the diameter of the disc inside the diamond plates or the teeth, but it may be realised as shown in Figure 1, with a diameter equal to the maximum diameter of the cutting discs with weakening and ripping lines 12 along circumferences corresponding to the other smaller commercially available diameters.<br>
This allows to market a single universal sheet to be adapted directly by the consumer upon applying the sheet to the disc.<br>
The one or more layers 3 of fabric may be impregnated with a two-component resin.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:-<br>
1.	A cutting disc made of metal (11), having on his peripheral area<br>
abrasive elements which are able to cut an object when the cutting  disc is<br>
made to rotate at a high number of rotation, characterized in that it comprises<br>
a vibration damping sheet comprising one or more layers (3) of carbon fiber<br>
fabric, on a face of said vibration damping sheet (1) being provided a layer of<br>
adhesive (4) able to adhere to the surface of the metal cutting disc (11).<br>
2.	A cutting disc as claimed in claim 1, wherein the vibration damping<br>
sheet (1) comprises one or more layers (3) of fabric made of carbon fiber and<br>
glass fibre, the two types of fibres being oriented differently.<br>

5.	A cutting disc as claimed in one or more of the previous claims,<br>
wherein the vibration damping sheet presents a thickness such that , once<br>
applied to the disc, it does not exceed the thickness of the tooth or of the<br>
diamond plate (10).<br>
6.	A cutting disc as claimed in one or more of the previous claims,<br>
wherein the vibration damping sheet    presents a circular shape with a<br>
