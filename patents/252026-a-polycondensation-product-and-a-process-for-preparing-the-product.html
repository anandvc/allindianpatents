				<td>Description<br><br>
The present invention relates to a polycondensation product based on aromatic or<br>
heteroaromatic compounds, a process for preparing it and its use as admixture for<br>
aqueous suspensions of inorganic binders such as cement paste, mortar or concrete.<br>
The use of these polymers leads to a significant improvement in the flowability of the<br>
composition during the hydration process.<br>
In aqueous suspensions of powdery inorganic or organic substances such as hydraulic<br>
binders (e.g. cement, lime, gypsum plaster or anhydrite), rock flour, ground silicate,<br>
chalk, clays, porcelain slip, talc, pigments, carbon black or polymer powders,<br>
admixtures in the form of dispersants are often added to improve their processibility,<br>
i.e. kneadability, flowability, sprayability, paintability or pumpability. These<br>
admixtures are able to break up agglomerates and disperse the particles formed as a<br>
result of adsorption on the surface of the particles. This leads, particularly in the case<br>
of highly concentrated dispersions, to a significant improvement in the processibility.<br>
In the production of building material mixtures containing hydraulic binders such as<br>
cement, lime, gypsum plaster or anhydrite, this effect can be utilized particularly<br>
advantageously since otherwise significantly more water would be required to<br>
achieve a readily workable consistency than would be required for the subsequent<br>
hydration process. The water which evaporates gradually after curing leaves voids<br>
which significantly impair the mechanical strengths and resistances of the building<br>
components.<br>
To reduce the proportion of water which is excess to hydration requirements and/or to<br>
optimize the workability at a given water/binder ratio, admixtures which are generally<br>
referred to as water reducers or plasticizers are used.<br>
Examples of cement dispersants or plasticizers which have hitherto mainly been used<br>
are salts of naphthalenesulphonic acid-formaldehyde condensates (cf. EP-A 214 412,<br>
hereinafter referred to as naphthalenesulphonates), salts of melaminesulphonic acid-<br>
formaldehyde condensates (cf. DE-C 16 71 017, hereinafter referred to as<br>
melaminesulphonates) and salts of polycarboxylic acids (cf. US 5,707,445 Bl, EP<br>
1 110 981 A2, EP 1 142 847 A2, hereinafter referred to as polycarboxylates). Such<br><br>
polycarboxylates are usually prepared by free-radical copolymerization of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids (e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or<br>
maleic acid or their salts) and poly(alkylene oxides) having a polymerizable end<br>
group (e.g. methacrylates, allyl ethers or vinyl ethers). This method of preparation<br>
leads to polymers having a comb-like structure.<br>
Each of the dispersants mentioned has specific advantages, but also individual<br>
disadvantages. Thus, for instance, polycarboxylates display a significant increase in<br>
the setting times of concrete combined with excellent plasticizing action. On the other<br>
hand, naphthalenesulphonates and melaminesulphonates display good plasticization<br>
and strength development is barely impaired by addition of these substances.<br>
However, these plasticizers have the problem of "slump loss", i.e. the plasticizing<br>
action is retained for only a relatively short time even at comparatively high dosages.<br>
This leads to problems particularly when there are relatively long time intervals<br>
between production of the concrete and its placement, as often occurs as a result of<br>
long transport distances or conveying paths.<br>
It is known from various studies on the mechanism of action of plasticizers that the<br>
effectiveness of the molecules used is based on two different effects. Firstly, the<br>
negatively charged acid groups of the plasticizers are adsorbed on the positively<br>
charged cement particle surface resulting from calcium ions. The electrostatic double<br>
layer formed in this way (zeta potential) leads to electrostatic repulsion between the<br>
particles, but this is relatively weak. In the case of the abovementioned comb<br>
polymers, this electrostatic repulsion is additionally reinforced by the bulkiness of the<br>
water-soluble, nonadsorbing poly(alkylene oxide)s. This steric repulsion is very much<br>
stronger than the electrostatic repulsion, so that it is easy to explain why the<br>
plasticizing action of the polycarboxylates is very much stronger than that of<br>
naphthalenesulphonates or melaminesulphonates, i.e. in order to achieve comparable<br>
plasticization, the polycarboxylate can be added in a significantly smaller amount.<br>
A disadvantage of polycarboxylates is that poly(alkylene oxide)s are necessary for<br>
preparing them and these have to be functionalized by provision of a polymerizable<br>
group in an extra reaction step. The cost of preparing these plasticizers is for this<br>
reason far above that for naphthalenesulphonates or melaminesulphonates, which<br>
explains the still very high consumption of such plasticizers.<br><br>
A polycondensation product which contains not only acid bonding groups but<br>
also nonadsorbing side chains is described in US 5,750,634, with the side chains<br>
being incorporated into the product by copolycondensation of melaminesulphonic<br>
acids, formaldehyde and polyalkylene oxides containirig amino groups. However,<br>
disadvantages of this process are, firstly, the high price of amino-functionalized<br>
polyalkylene oxides and secondly the low degrees of polymerization achieved in<br>
this process, which adversely effects the effectiveness of the polymers obtained<br>
compared to the abovementioned polycarboxylates. A further examples of such a<br>
polycondensation product having nonadsorbing side chains is described in EP 0<br>
780 348 Al. Here, ethoxylated phenol is subjected to a polycondensation with<br>
hydroxybenzoic acids in the presence of formaldehyde. However, the reaction<br>
times of from 10 to 12 hours described there are not very suitable for<br>
economically feasible industrial implementation. In addition, hydroxybenzoic<br>
acids are relatively expensive and, owing to their powdery consistency,<br>
significantly more difficult to meter on an industrial scale than are, for example,<br>
liquids.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel<br>
polycondensation product which does not have the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages. It should contain both nonadsorbing side chains and also<br>
adsorbing bonding groups and thereby bring about plasticization of the<br>
dispersion comparable to that achieved using comb-like polycarboxylates and<br>
maintain this effect a prolonged period of time ("slump retention"). In addition,<br>
the use of expensive components which are difficult to meter on an industrial<br>
scale should be avoided in the synthesis of the novel polycondensation product<br>
so as to provide an easy-to-synthesize, inexpensive plasticizer which is highly<br>
effective even at a small dosage.<br><br>
It has susprisingly been found that the polycondensation producdt of the<br>
invention effects very good plasticization of hydraulic binders such as cement.<br>
Compared to nanphthalenesulphonates or melaminesulphonates, it leads to<br>
significantly better plasticization of the building material combined with a lower<br>
dosage, with the flowability being able to be maintained over a prolonged a<br>
period of time.<br><br>
The polycondensation product corresponding to the present invention thus consists of<br>
a maximum of three components A, B) and C, with the use of component B) also<br>
being able to be dispensed with in some cases. The component A) is an aromatic or<br>
heteroaromatic compound which has from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, wherein in<br>
heteroaromatic compounds some of the C-atoms, preferably 1 to 5 C-atoms, more<br>
preferably 1 to 3, and most preferably 1 or 2 C-atoms are replaced by heteroatoms.<br>
Suitable heteroatoms are, for example, O, N, S and/or P. This compound contains, on<br>
average, one or more radicals, preferably one radical, which have from 1 to 300<br>
radicals selected from the group consisting of oxyethylene [-CH2-CH2-O-] and<br>
oxypropylene [-CH(CH3)-CH2-O- and/or (-CH2-CH(CH3)-O-)] per molecule bounded<br>
via an O or N atom to the aromatic or heteroaromatic compound. Such a radical can<br>
be a uniform compound but will advantageously be a mixture of components whose<br>
number of oxyalkylene groups comprising two or three carbon atoms (i.e.<br>
oxyethylene and/or oxypropylene) is different, with the chemical structure of the unit<br>
at the end of the oxyalkylene groups generally being identical and a mixture of<br>
chemically different aromatic compounds also being able to be used in some cases.<br>
The average number of oxyalkylene groups consisting of two or three carbon atoms<br>
per molecule which are present in the components giving such a mixture is from 1 to<br>
300, preferably from 2 to 280 and particularly preferably from 10 to 200. Compounds<br>
having at least 3, in particular at least 4, preferably at least 5 and most preferably at<br>
least 20 oxyalkylene groups are also preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, phenol, naphthol, aniline or furfuryl alcohol derivatives<br>
are used as aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds A). For the purposes of the<br>
present invention, it is possible for the component A) to have substituents selected<br>
from the group consisting of OH, OR1, NH2, NHR1, NR12, C1-C10-alkyl, SO3H, COOH,<br>
PO3H2, OPO3H2, where the C1-C10-alkyl radicals may in turn bear phenyl or 4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl radicals and R1 is a C1-C4-alkyl radical. Specific examples of the<br>
component A) are the adducts of 1 mol phenol, cresol, resorcinol, nonylphenol,<br>
methoxyphenol, naphthol, methylnaphthol, butylnaphthol, bisphenol A, aniline,<br>
methylaniline, hydroxyaniline, methoxyaniline, furfuryl alcohol or/and salicylic acid<br>
with from 1 to 300 mol of an oxyethylene and/or oxypropylene radical. From the<br>
point of view of a condensation with formaldehyde which is easy to carry out, the<br>
component A) is preferably an adduct of a benzene derivative, e.g. phenol, which can<br>
bear a C1-Cio-alkyl group, particularly preferably an adduct of phenol with an<br><br>
alkylene oxide. The aromatic starting component for A) can in some cases already<br>
contain one or more oxyalkylene groups having two or three carbon atoms, and in<br>
such a case the sum of oxyalkylene groups, both in the starting substance and in the<br>
oxyalkylene groups added on by means of an addition reaction, extends from 1 to 300<br>
per molecule.<br>
Substances by means of which a poly(oxyalkylene) group can be introduced into the<br>
aromatic starting component for A) are ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The<br>
addition reaction can be effected either in random order or in the form of a block<br>
structure. The terminal unit of the poly(oxyalkylene) group of component A) is not<br>
restricted to a hydroxyl group; rather, it can also consist of an alkyl ether or a<br>
carboxylic ester as long as this group does not hinder the condensation with<br>
formaldehyde or the aldehyde acid component.<br>
The component B) is at least an aromatic compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of phenols, phenol ethers, naphthols, naphthol ethers, anilines, furfuryl<br>
alcohols and/or an aminoplast former selected from the group consisting of melamine<br>
(derivatives), urea (derivatives) and carboxamides. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
aromatic compound B) has substituents selected from the group consisting of OH,<br>
NH2, OR2, NHR2, NR2R2, COOH, C1-C4-alkyl, SO3H, PO3H2, OPO3H2, where the alkyl<br>
radicals may in turn bear phenyl or 4-hydroxyphenyl radicals and R2 is a C1-C4-alkyl<br>
radical or a (poly)oxy-C2-C3-alkylene radical (having from 1 to 300 ethylene oxide<br>
and/or propylene oxide units) which may in turn bear a substituent selected from the<br>
group consisting of OH, COOH, SO3H, PO3H2, OPO3H2. Examples thereof are phenol,<br>
phenoxyacetic acid, phenoxyethanol, phenoxyethanol phosphate (being a mono-, di-<br>
or triester or any mixture thereof), phenoxydiglycol, or phenoxy(poly)ethylenglycol<br>
phosphate (being a mono-, di- or triester or any mixture thereof), phenoxydiglycol<br>
phosphate, methoxyphenol, resorcinol, cresol, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, aniline,<br>
methylaniline, N-phenyldiethanolamine, N-phenyl-N,N-dipropanoic acid, N-phenyl-<br>
N,N-diacetic acid, N-phenyldiethanolamine diphosphate, phenolsulphonic acid,<br>
anthranilic acid, succinic monoamide, furfuryl alcohol, melamine and urea.<br>
The third component C) is an aldehyde compound selected from the group consisting<br>
of formaldehyde, glyoxylic acid and benzaldehyde and mixtures thereof, where the<br><br>
benzaldehyde may additionally bear acid groups of the formulae COOMa, SO3Ma and<br>
PO3Ma and M = H, alkali metal (such as Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, in particular Na, K) or<br>
alkaline earth metal (such as Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), ammonium or an organic amine radical<br>
and a may also be 1/2,1 or 2. In general, formaldehyde is used in combination with a<br>
further aldehyde containing acid groups or their appropriate salts. It is also possible to<br>
carry out the polycondensation without the presence of formaldehyde. The presence<br>
of acid groups in at least one of the aldehyde components is preferred for use of the<br>
resulting polymers as plasticizers, since the adsorption of the polymers on the cement<br>
particle surface which is necessary for a plasticizing effect can be achieved in this<br>
way. However, if the acid group is introduced via a suitable component B), the use of<br>
aldehydes containing acid groups can also be dispensed with. Preferred aldehyde acid<br>
derivatives encompass aldehydecarboxylic acids, aldehydesulphonic acids and<br>
aldehydephosphonic acids. Particular preference is given to using formaldehyde,<br>
glyoxylic acid, benzaldehydesulphonic acid or benzaldehydedisulphonic acid. As<br>
monovalent or divalent salts of these aldehyde acid derivatives, preference is given to<br>
using the alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts,<br>
e.g. calcium salts, and ammonium salts or salts of organic amines. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the ratio of formaldehyde to the aldehyde acid component is 1:0.1-100,<br>
in particular 1:0.5-50 and particularly preferably 1:0.5-20.<br>
The aldehyde components are preferably used in the form of their aqueous solutions,<br>
which considerably simplifies metering or mixing of the components in a synthesis<br>
carried out industrially; however, the use of the pure crystalline or pulverulent<br>
substances or their hydrates is also possible.<br>
The molar ratio of the components A), B) and C) can be varied within wide limits,<br>
but it has been found to be particularly advanlag molar ratio of<br>
components C):A) + if applicable B) to be set to 1:0.01-10, in particular 1:0.1-8, and<br>
—<br>
the molar ratio of components A):B) to be set to from 10:1 to 1:10<br>
The condensation product of the invention is prepared by condensing the components<br>
A), optionally B) and C) in aqueous solution in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst<br>
at a temperature of from 20 to 140°C and a pressure of from 1 to 10 bar.<br><br>
Catalysts used here are mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid or other strong mineral acids. Particular preference is given to using<br>
sulphuric acid, but the acids which can be used are not restricted to the acids<br>
mentioned.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polycondensation product of the invention is prepared<br>
in a two-stage process in which S^<br>
a)	the component B) and an aqueous solution of the aldehyde component C) are<br>
precondensed at a temperature of from 20 to 95°C for a period of from 0.1 to<br>
10 hours<br>
and<br>
b)	the component A) and an aqueous solution of the aldehyde component C) are<br>
then added and the condensation is completed in the presence of the catalyst at<br>
a temperature of from 20 to 140°C for a period of from 0.1 to 24 hours.<br>
The preferred temperature range in step a) is from 40 to 90°C and in step b) is from<br>
60 to 130°C. The ratio of the total amount of aldehyde component added to the sum<br>
of the monomers A) and B) is 1:0.01-10, preferably 1:0.1-8 and particularly<br>
preferably 1:0.2-5. The progress of the polycondensation is characterized by a distinct<br>
increase in the viscosity. When the desired viscosity has been reached, the<br>
polycondensation is stopped by cooling and addition of a basic compound. The<br>
neutralization of the polycondensation product and the catalyst is carried out using<br>
the customary alkaline compounds or salts, in particular hydroxides. Preference is<br>
given to using sodium hydroxide for neutralization.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reaction solution after end of the polycondensation<br>
reaction is subjected to a thermal after-treatment at a pH of from 8.0 to 13.0 and a<br>
temperature of from 60 to 120°C. This thermal after-treatment, which generally has a<br>
duration of from 10 minutes to 3 hours, makes it possible to reduce the aldehyde<br>
content and in particular the formaldehyde content of the reaction solution<br>
significantly. Besides the afore-described removal of free formaldehyde by the so-<br>
called Canizzarro reaction, of course, any other known method of reducing excess<br>
formaldehyde, for example, as known from the chemistry of melamine- and phenol-<br><br>
formaldehyde resins, can be used. The addition of small amounts of sodium bisulfite<br>
as formaldehyde absorber is one example thereof.<br>
It is also possible, within the scope of the present invention, for the sodium sulphate<br>
formed in the neutralization with sodium hydroxide to be separated off after<br>
conclusion of the polycondensation reaction, for which purpose recourse can be made<br>
to various possibilities.<br>
It has here been found to be particularly advantageous to bring the reaction solution<br>
to a pH of from 1.0 to 4.0, in particular from 1.5 to 2.0, resulting in the<br>
polycondensation product precipitating as a solid and settling at the bottom of the<br>
reaction vessel. The supernatant aqueous salt solution can then be separated off and<br>
the largely salt-free polycondensation product which remains can be taken up again<br>
in such an amount of water that the desired solids concentration is obtained. An<br>
alternative would be to carry out the neutralization reaction using calcium hydroxide<br>
solution, so that the calcium sulphate formed here precipitates in the form of gypsum<br>
from the solution and can thus be separated off by means of filtration. Neutralization<br>
also can be carried out using Ba(OH)2 instead of calcium sulfate. In that case, poorly<br>
soluble barium sulfate is formed with the free sulfuric acid, which subsequently can<br>
be filtered off to obtain salt-free polymers. Furthermore, it is also possible to separate<br>
off the undesirable sodium sulphate by dialysis or ultrafiltration. A further, although<br>
technically difficult to realize, possibility is to introduce the aqueous solution<br>
neutralized with sodium hydroxide into an organic solvent which is miscible with<br>
water (methanol, acetone), filter off the precipitated sodium sulphate and evaporate<br>
the solution containing the polycondensation product and subsequently take it up in<br>
water again.<br>
The polycondensation product obtained by condensation of the above-described<br>
components can be used as plasticizer in the state in which it is obtained in the<br>
condensation, i.e. in the form of the free acid. However, from the point of view of<br>
storage and use of the polymer, the salt obtained by neutralization of the<br>
polycondensation product is preferred. Examples of neutralized salts of the<br>
polycondensation products are the alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts,<br>
alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium salts, and ammonium salts or salts of organic<br>
amines.<br><br>
The polycondensation products of the invention are highly suitable as admixtures for<br>
aqueous suspensions based on inorganic binders, in particular cement and also lime<br>
and gypsum plaster, and are for this purpose used in an amount of from 0.01 to 10%<br>
by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 5% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
inorganic binder. Compared to the previously known admixtures based on<br>
polycondensation products with formaldehyde, the polycondensation products of the<br>
invention impart a significantly improved workability at significantly lower dosages<br>
to the building material mixtures.<br>
By specifically selecting suitable alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides salts of the<br>
inventive polycondensation products can be produced via neutralization processes, by<br>
means of which the length of workability of aqueous suspensions of inorganic binders<br>
and especially concrete can be influenced. If, for example, the inventive<br>
polycondensation product in the form of a phosphate-containing phenol resin is<br>
neutralized with calcium hydroxide instead of sodium hydroxide as described, the<br>
process of slump development changes with time. While in the case of the sodium<br>
salt a decrease of workability can be observed with time, said performance is<br>
completeley reversed in the case of the calcium salt of the identical polymer: At the<br>
beginning, there is a slight reduction of water (low slump), whereas said slump<br>
increases with time passing. Potassium salts and barium salts thereby behave<br>
analogously to sodium salt. This means the workability of the binder-containing mass<br>
such as, for example, concrete or mortar, decreases in the course of time; in the case<br>
of the calcium salts, however, slump very strongly increases with time.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
A. Preparation of phenoxyethanol phosphate<br>
1 mol of phenoxyethanol is esterifled azeotropically in the presence of 1.1 mol of<br>
H3PO3 in xylene on a water separator. The reaction product which precipitates on<br>
