				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a method of, and composition for, reduction or prevention<br>
of biofilm formation on moist or wet surfaces, and more particularly to the reduction of<br>
pathogens in, and in the vicinity of, air-conditioning systems. The invention has been<br>
developed primarily for use in air-conditioning (including air cooling and air heating)<br>
systems, and will be described hereinafter with reference to this field of use. However, it<br>
will be appreciated that the invention can be applied in other situations in which it is<br>
desired to inhibit biofilm formation or micro-organism colonization of a surface.<br>
Background Art<br>
Air conditioning systems such as are commonly provided in office, residential,<br>
health care and other buildings frequently include components with moist or wet surfaces.<br>
A good example is the air conditioner condenser which may comprise a plurality of heat<br>
exchange fins, for example of aluminium construction, cooled by heat conductive<br>
connection with a recirculating refrigerant. Hot air to be cooled is passed over the fins,<br>
and moisture in the air condenses on the fins and drains away. In some cases the heat<br>
exchange surfaces of the condenser are cooled by a recirculating thin film of water.<br>
The cooling surfaces are typically of a large area, are moist or wet, and provide an<br>
ideal environment for the immobilization and growth of micro-organisms which are	<br>
carried by the air and which form biofilms on the surfaces. The micro-organisms include<br>
bacteria and fungi which multiply on the surface. Within months the space between<br>
adjacent heat exchange surfaces may be totally occluded by biofilm growth.<br>
Biofilm reduces efficacy and poses major health risks. Efficacy is lost because the<br>
biofilm has poor heat transfer properties and so the thermal efficiency of the condenser is<br>
diminished. Microbial activity can also shorten the service life of a system because acidic<br>
bacterial exudates can cause serious corrosion and because the increase in biomass on, and<br>
in, the components can lessen air-flow and increase back pressure in the system, requiring<br>
maintenance cleaning after a short life in service.<br><br>
The health risk arises because the presence of biofilm in turn provides a haven for<br>
the further accumulation and further growth of pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, viruses,<br>
allergens, yeasts, and moulds. Conditions for the growth of such organisms are especially<br>
favourable during periods of high humidity such as may occur when the system is off, for<br>
example at night, but also arise during normal operation. The presence of organisms is<br>
highly undesirable because they can cause illness or death in humans and animals, create<br>
odours and can damage or destroy a wide variety of materials.<br>
Of particular concern in terms of human health and safety are endotoxins and<br>
mycotoxins which are breakdown components of fungal and bacterial cell walls and which<br>
are known human respiratory allergens. In some individuals they can trigger asthma<br>
attacks, and in all cases have been shown to cause immune response. It is currently<br>
thought that over a period of exposure this reduces the ability of the immune system to<br>
respond to antagonists and leaves the subject more prone to infection by bacteria, viruses,<br>
etc. Also of concern are fungal spores, bacterial spores and bacteria.<br>
In health care facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes the adverse<br>
consequences of release of endotoxins and myotoxins from biomass are exacerbated<br>
because many of the patients are in a weakened condition due to their primary health care<br>
problem. Micro-organisms that would not be a major threat to a healthy person can be<br>
fatal to a patient with a diminished capacity to defend themselves from infection.<br>
Increasing attention is also being paid to other environments such as public buildings,<br>
since if pathogenic micro-organisms find their way via conditioned air or ventilation<br>
shafts, into a building they can be rapidly circulated throughout the building thereby since<br>
if pathogenic micro-organisms find their way via conditioned air or ventilation shafts, into<br>
a building they can be rapidly circulated throughout the building thereby greatly<br>
increasing the likelihood of the spread of infection and disease. The prevention of spore<br>
germination and microbial survival in air conditioning systems would help reduce the risk<br>
of illness and hypersensitivity reactions.<br><br>
To date there has been no effective means of prevention of biomass growth and the<br>
only means of addressing the problem has been periodic cleaning, which is labour<br>
intensive, costly and inconvenient and which does not adequately deal with health<br>
concerns between cleaning operations. Although various coating materials have been<br>
proposed, none have been able to resist the moist conditions or remain effective in<br>
preventing biofilm formation for a useful period.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the<br>
deficiencies of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.<br>
Many regions of the world employ heated filtered air in buildings as a means of<br>
central heating. It will be understood that such systems contribute to the same hazards as<br>
described above for air conditioning and the invention is not limited to any particular kind<br>
of filter or airflow system.<br>
Description Of The Invention<br>
According to a first aspect the invention provides a biostatic coating composition<br>
comprising a film forming composition which on drying produces an intrinsically<br>
hydrophobic film and including a biocidal complex A-B in which A is a phenolic biocide<br>
and B is selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone copolymers and mixtures thereof, and wherein the biocidal complex<br>
A-B is not water soluble.<br>
If it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the phrase "not water<br>
soluble" means not water soluble at the temperatures at which the composition is used.<br>
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the<br>
claims, the words 'comprise', 'comprising', and the like are to be construed in an inclusive<br>
sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of<br>
"including, but not limited to".<br><br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a biostatic coating<br>
composition according to the first aspect wherein the coating composition is selected from<br>
acrylic polymer based compositions, methacrylic polymer based compositions, acrylic<br>
copolymer based compositions, methacrylic copolymer based compositions, vinyl polymer<br>
based compositions, vinyl copolymer based compositions, epoxy resins, epoxy esters, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition has bacteriostatic and/or fungistatic properties.<br>
The film forming composition may be based on an emulsion or latex, a polymer or<br>
copolymer solution, or a polymer or copolymer emulsion. The film forming composition<br>
may be a water-based polymer or copolymer emulsion.<br>
For preference, the film forming composition is or includes an acrylic polymer,<br>
acrylic copolymer, mixtures of acrylic polymers, mixtures of acrylic copolymers or<br>
mixtures of acrylic polymers and copolymers. More preferably, the film forming<br>
composition is or includes an acrylic - styrene copolymer<br>
The film forming composition may be or includes an epoxy or epoxy ester.<br>
Highly preferred coating compositions are water-based polymers or copolymer<br>
emulsion or latex compositions, and especially those including an epoxy ester.<br>
The film forming composition may be or includes a vinyl acetate acrylic<br>
copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the film forming composition is present in an amount of 30 to 80% w/w<br>
of the mixture, more preferably the film forming composition is present in an amount of<br>
40 to 70% w/w of the mixture and even more preferably the film forming composition is<br>
present in an amount of 50 to 60% w/w of the mixture.<br><br>
Preferred biocides for use in the biocidal complex A-B are triclosan; diclosan;<br>
dichlorophen; orfhophenylphenol; orthobenzylparachlorophenol, cresols, xylols, and<br>
substituted diphenyl ethers.<br>
More preferably, biocide A is a halogenated phenolic biocide, in preference a<br>
chloro-phenolic biocide and most preferably, biocide A is triclosan.<br>
Preferably, biocide A is present in an amount of 0.5 to 5% w/w of the mixture,<br>
more preferably in an amount of 1 to 2% w/w of the mixture and even more preferably in<br>
an amount of 1.5% w/w of the mixture.<br>
Preferably, the complexing partner B is polyvinylpyrrolidone, or may be, for<br>
example, a polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer.<br>
Preferably, B is present in an amount of 2 to 10% of the mixture, more preferably B<br>
is present in an amount of 3 to 8% of the mixture, and even more preferably B is present in<br>
an amount of about 5% of the mixture<br>
Preferably, the biostatic composition contains solvent in an amount of 20 to 40% of<br>
the mixture, more preferably 25 to 35% of the mixture. One preferred solvent is water.<br>
It has been practised to combine a PVP/phenolic complex in a hydrophilic film<br>
forming polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymer or copolymer whereby the complex may be<br>
loosely bound to impregnated paper or textile wipes for cleaning food preparation surfaces<br>
and the like. In the forgoing applications the complex is readily leached from the wipe<br>
substrate and can readily contact bacteria on the surface being cleaned/disinfected. The<br>
complex does not have any long lasting effect on the surface, and the wipe must be<br>
disposed of after approximately a dozen washes. The present applicant was thus<br>
surprised to discover that inclusion of the PVP complex in a coating composition applied<br>
on, for example, a metal or masonry surface, significantly inhibited biofilm growth on the<br>
polymer coated surface, when the coating polymer might have been expected to<br>
encapsulate the biocide and protect micro-organisms from contact with the biocide. It was<br><br>
even more surprising that coatings including the complex according to the invention have<br>
prevented biomass growth on coated metal for periods exceeding three years in an<br>
environment in which such growth was previously a major problem. It is also surprising<br>
that such a small concentration of biocide is effective for such a long duration.<br>
It will be appreciated that PVP/phenolic complexes are not water soluble and their<br>
inclusion in coating compositions is not simple. This has been achieved in the case of<br>
water based emulsion coating compositions by dispersing the complex in the aqueous<br>
phase together with a water soluble high boiling point polar solvent (eg N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone or a glycol ether). After the coating is applied, and as the water evaporates,<br>
the relative proportion of the high BP polar solvent increases and at a critical point<br>
dissolves the biocidal complex leaving the biocide homogeneously distributed throughout<br>
the film. It will also be understood that while water is a preferred vehicle, dispersion in<br>
solvent based coating compositions can be similarly achieved.<br>
According to a third aspect, the invention provides a biostatic composition<br>
according to the first or second aspects further including a water soluble polar solvent<br>
having a higher boiling point than a solvent vehicle of the coating composition.<br>
Preferably, the high boiling polar solvent aids dispersion of the complex A-B in a<br>
polymer emulsion or latex. Preferably, the water soluble polar solvent is selected from N-<br>
methyl pyrrolidone, glycol ethers, and combinations thereof.<br>
Coatings according to the invention may be used as protective coatings on<br>
components susceptible to biomass growth , such as air conditioning condenser plates,<br>
vents and on other surfaces, eg susceptible surfaces in operating theatres, to prevent the<br>
formation of biofilm on the surface. The invention may also be applied in decorative<br>
coatings such as paints to prevent mould growth on susceptible surfaces. Coatings<br>
according to the invention may be applied (without limitation to surfaces of metal,<br>
masonry, timber, particle board, and other building and construction materials). Some<br>
compositions may desirably be baked onto the surface or dried at elevated temperatures.<br><br>
According to a third aspect, the invention provides a biostatic coating<br>
formed by drying a film or thin layer of a biostatic coating composition according to any<br>
one of the preceding aspects.<br>
The coating is preferably effective to prevent biofilm growth on its surface for in<br>
excess of one year, and even more preferably is effective to prevent biofilm growth on its<br>
surface for in excess of three years.<br>
The coating may be applied to metal, to concrete or a cementitious surface or to a<br>
timber surface.<br>
The coating may be applied in the form of a decorative coating. One example is in<br>
the form of a paint to prevent mould growth. Such a paint can further include paint<br>
ingredients selected from the group consisting of suspension agents, thixotropic agents,<br>
flow and viscosity modifiers, preservatives and the like. Other paint ingredients may be<br>
advantageously selected from the group consisting of corrosion inhibitors and/or<br>
pigments.<br>
Thus depending on intended end use, compositions according to the invention may<br>
be pigmented and in that case will normally include other paint ingredients such as<br>
suspension agents, thixotropic agents, flow and viscosity modifiers, preservatives and the<br>
like. The compositions need not be pigmented and may include corrosion inhibitors and<br>
other additives known to be useful in film-forming coatings.<br>
It will be understood that it is sufficient that the treatment is bacteriostatic or<br>
fungistatic. That is to say, it is sufficient that the treating agent stops colonisation on the<br>
surface rather than kills organisms on a colonised surface.<br>
According to a fourth aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the<br>
formation of a biofilm on a surface susceptible to such formation comprising the steps of<br>
applying a coating of a composition according to the first or second aspects to the surface<br>
and drying the composition or allowing the composition to dry.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the surface is an air conditioning surface, an air<br>
conditioning condenser plate, an air conditioning condenser vent, or may be a susceptible<br>
surface in an operating theatre.<br>
In some embodiments, the composition is baked onto the surface or dried at<br>
elevated temperatures.<br>
According to a fifth aspect, the invention provides a surface treated in accordance<br>
with a composition of the fist or second aspects or according to a method of the fourth<br>
aspect.<br>

Abstract<br><br>
Biofilm Growth Prevention<br>
A biostatic coating comprising a coating composition which on drying produces an<br>
intrinsically hydrophobic film. The coating composition includes a biocidal complex A-B<br>
in which A is a phenolic biocide and B is selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP"),<br>
PVP polymers, PVP copolymers and mixtures thereof. The coating composition for<br>
example is selected from acrylic and methacrylic polymer based compositions, acrylic and<br>
methacrylic copolymer based compositions, vinyl polymer based compositions, vinyl<br>
copolymer based compositions, epoxy resins, epoxy esters, and mixtures thereof. Suitable<br>
biocides for use in the invention include, but are not limited to complexes of PVP or PVP<br>
copolymer with triclosan; diclosan; dichlorophen; orthophenylphenol;<br>
orthobenzylparachlorophenol, cresols, xylols, and substituted diphenyl ethers.</td>
