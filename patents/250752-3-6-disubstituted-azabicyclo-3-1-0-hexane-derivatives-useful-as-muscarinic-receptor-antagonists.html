				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to the derivatives of novel 3,6-disubstituted azabicyclo[3.1.0] hexanes.<br>
The compounds of this invention are muscarinic receptor antagonists which are useful, inter-alia, for the treatment of various diseases of the respiratory, urinary and gastrointestinal systems mediated through muscarinic receptors.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the present invention and the methods of treating the diseases mediated through muscarinic receptors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Muscarinic receptors as members of the G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are<br>
composed of a family of 5 receptor sub-types (M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5) and are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These receptors are widely distributed on multiple organs and tissues and are critical to the maintenance of central and peripheral cholinergic neurotransmission. The regional distribution of these receptor sub-types in the brain and other organs has been documented. For example, the M1 subtype is located primarily in neuronal tissues such as cereberal cortex and autonomic ganglia, the M2 subtype is present mainly in the heart where it mediates cholinergically induced bradycardia, and the M3 subtype is located predominantly on smooth muscle and salivary glands (Nature, 1986; 323: 411; Science, 1987; 237: 527).<br>
A review in Current opinions in Chemical Biology, 1999; 3: 426, as well as in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001; 22: 409 by Eglen et. al., describe the biological potentials of modulating muscarinic receptor subtypes by ligands in different disease conditions like Alzheimer's disease, pain, urinary disease condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc.<br>
A review in J. Med. Chem., 2000; 43: 4333 by Christian C. Felder et. al. describes therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system and elaborates on muscarinic receptor structure and function, pharmacology and their therapeutic uses.<br>
The pharmacological and medical aspects of the muscarinic class of acetylcholine agonists and antagonists are presented in a review in Molecules, 2001, 6: 142.<br>
N.J.M. Birdsall et. al. in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001; 22: 215 have also summarized the recent developments on the role of different muscarinic receptor subtypes using different muscaranic receptor of knock out mice.<br>
Muscarinic agonists such as muscarine and pilocarpine and antagonists such as atropine have been known for over a century, but little progress has been made in the discovery of receptor subtype-selective compounds making it difficult to assign specific functions to the individual<br>
receptors. Although classical muscarinic antagonists such as atropine are potent bronchodilators,<br><br>
their clinical utility is limited due to high incidence of both peripheral and central adverse effects such as tachycardia, blurred vision, dryness of mouth, constipation, dementia, etc. Subsequent development of the quarterly derivatives of atropine such as ipratropium bromide are better tolerated than parenterally administered options but most of them are not ideal anti-cholinergic bronchodilators due to lack of selectivity for muscarinic receptor sub-types. The existing compounds offer limited therapeutic benefit due to their lack of selectivity resulting in dose limiting side-effects such as thirst, nausea, mydriasis and those associated with the heart such as tachycardia mediated by the M2 receptor.<br>
Annual review of Pharmacological Toxicol., 2001; 41: 691, describes the pharmacology of the lower urinary tract infections. Although anti muscarinic agents such as oxybutynin and tolterodine that act non-selectively on muscarinic receptors have been used for many years to treat bladder hyperactivity, the clinical effectiveness of these agents has been limited due to the side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation. Tolterodine is considered to be generally better tolerated than oxybutynin. (W.D.Steers et. al. in Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2: 268, C.R. Chappie et. al. in Urology, 55: 33), Steers WD, Barrot DM, Wein AJ, 1996, Voiding dysfunction: diagnosis classification and management. In Adult and Pediatric Urology, ed. JY Gillenwatter, JT Grayhack, SS Howards, JW Duckett, pp 1220-1325, St. Louis, MO; Mosby. 3rd edition.)<br>
Despite these advances, there remains a need for development of new highly selective muscarinic antagonists which can interact with distinct subtypes, thus avoiding the occurrence of adverse effects.<br>
Compounds having antagonistic activity against muscarinic receptors have been described in Japanese patent application Laid Open Number 92921/1994 and 135958/1994; WO 93/16048; U.S. Patent No. 3,176,019; GB 940,540; EP 0325 571; WO 98/29402; EP 0801067; EP 0388054; WO 9109013; U.S. Patent No. 5,281,601. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,900, 6,130,232 and 5,948,792; WO 97/45414 are related to 1,4-disubstituted piperidine derivatives; WO 98/05641 describes fluorinated, 1,4-disubstitued piperidine derivatives; and W096/33973 are other close art references.<br>
A report in J. Med. Chem., 2002; 44:984, describes cyclohexylmethyl piperidinyl triphenylpropioamide derivatives as selective M3 antagonist discriminating against the other receptor subtypes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by techniques well known in the art and familiar to the average synthetic organic chemist. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the following novel and inventive reaction sequences:<br><br><br><br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br><br>
The compounds of Formula I of the present invention may be prepared by the reaction sequence as shown in Scheme I. The preparation comprises condensing a compound of Formula VII (Ar, R1, R2, W are the same as defined earlier) with the compound of Formula VI (wherein P is any protecting group for an amino group including benzyl and t-butyloxy carbonyl groups, X, Y, Z, Q, R6 and R7 are the same as defined earlier) in the presence of a condensing agent to give a protected compound of Formula VIII which on deprotection in the presence of a deprotecting agent in an organic solvent gives an unprotected intermediate of Formula IX which is finally N-alkylated or benzylated with a suitable alkylating or benzylating agent L-R4 to give a compound of Formula I (wherein L is any leaving group and R4 is as defined above).<br>
The reaction of the compound of Formula VII with a compound of Formula VI to give a compound of Formula VIII is carried out in the presence of a condensing agent which is selected<br><br>
from the group consisting of l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).<br>
The reaction of the compound of Formula VII with a compound of Formula VI to give a compound of Formula VIII is carried out in a suitable solvent selected from the group consisting of N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, toluene, and xylene at a temperature ranging from about 0-140°C.<br>
The deprotection of the compound of Formula VIII to give a compound of Formula IX is carried out with a deprotecting agent which is selected from the group consisting of palladium on carbon, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrochloric acid.<br>
The deprotection of the compound of Formula VIII to give a compound of Formula IX is carried out in a suitable organic solvent selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile at temperatures ranging from about 10-50°C.<br>
The N-alkylation or benzylation of the compound of Formula IX to give a compound of Formula I is carried out with a suitable alkylating or benzylating agent, L-R4 wherein L is any leaving group, known in the art, preferably selected from halogen, O-mestyl and O-tosyl group.<br>
The N-alkylation or benzylation of the compound of Formula IX to give a compound of Formula I is carried out in a suitable organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylforrnamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, at temperatures ranging from about 25-100°C.<br>
In the above scheme, where specific bases, condensing agents, protecting groups, deprotecting agents, N-alkylating/benzylating agents, solvents, catalysts etc. are mentioned, it is to be understood that other bases, condensing agents, protecting groups, deprotecting agents, N-alkylating/benzylating agents, solvents, catalysts etc. known to those skilled in the art may be used. Similarly, the reaction temperature and duration may be adjusted according to the desired needs.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be prepared by condensing compounds of formula VI with an aryl alpha keto ester (Ar(CO)COOR' wherin R' denotes a lower alkyl group) and the compounds thus formed may be subsequently reacted with the condensate R"M , wherein R" groups include groups such as phenyl, C4-6 alkyl etc. and M may be alkali metal or MgX, wherein x is a halogen atom. Alpha keto esters may in turn be prepared by following J.O.C., 46,213(1981), or synthetic communication, 11, 943(1981).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be prepared by reacting R"M (wherein M and R" have the same as described above) with the aryl alpha keto ester (Ar(CO)COOR' wherin R' denotes a lower alkyl group) to form an alpha hydroxy ester. This product is further reacted with compound of formula VI and then the protecting group is removed to give compounds of formula VIII.<br><br><br>
Suitable salts of the compounds represented by the Formula I were prepared so as to solubilize the compound in aqueous medium for biological evaluations. Examples of such salts include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as inorganic acid salts (e.g. hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, nitrate and phosphorate), organic acid salts (e.g. acetate, tartarate, citrate, fumarate, maleate, tolounesulphonate and methanesulphonate). When carboxyl group is included in the Formula I as a substituent, it may be an alkali metal salt(e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like). These salts may be prepared by the usual prior art techniques, such as treating the compound with an equivalent amount of inorganic or organic, acid or base in a suitable solvent.<br>

Biological Activity Radioligand Binding Assays:<br>
The affinity of test compounds for M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined by [3H]-N-methylscopolamine binding studies using rat heart and submandibular gland respectively as described by Moriya et al., (Life Sci, 1999,64(25):2351-2358) with minor modifications. Membrane preparation: Submandibular glands and heart were isolated and placed in ice cold homogenising buffer (HEPES 20mM, 10mM EDTA, pH 7.4) immediately after sacrifice. The tissues were homogenised in 10 volumes of homogenising buffer and the homogenate was filtered through two layers of wet gauze and filtrate was centrifuged at 500g for 10min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 40,000g for 20 min. The pellet thus obtained was resuspended in<br>
same volume of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, EDTA 5mM, pH 7.4) and were stored at -70°C until the time of assay.<br>
Ligand binding assay: The compounds were dissolved and diluted in DMSO. The membrane homogenates (150-250 µg protein) were incubated in 250 ul of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, pH<br>
7.4) at 24-25°C for 3h. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uM atropine . The incubation was terminated by vacuum filtration over GF/B fiber filters(Wallac). The filters were then washed with ice cold 50mM Tris HC1 buffer (pH 7.4). The filter mats were dried and bound radioactivity retained on filters was counted. The IC50 &amp; Kd were estimated by using the<br>
non-linear curve fitting program using G Pad Prism software. The value of inhibition constant Ki was calculated from competitive binding studies by using Cheng &amp; Prusoff equation (Biochem Pharmacol, 1973,22: 3099-3108), Ki = IC50 /(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of<br>
[3H]NMS used in the particular experiment. Functional Experiments using isolated rat bladder: Methodology:<br>
Animals were euthanized by overdose of urethane and whole bladder was isolated and removed rapidly and placed in ice cold Tyrode buffer with the following composition (mMol/L) NaCl 137; KC1 2.7; CaCl2 1.8; MgCl2 0.1; NaHC03 11.9; NaH2PO4 0.4; Glucose 5.55   and continuously<br><br>
gassed with 95% 02 and 5 % CO2.<br>
The bladder was cut into longitudinal strips (3 mm wide and 5-6 mm long) and mounted in 10 ml<br>
organ baths at 30° C, with one end connected to the base of the tissue holder and the other end<br>
connected to a polygraph through a force displacement transducer. Each tissue was maintained at<br>
a constant basal tension of 2 g and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour during which the PSS was<br>
changed every 15 min. At the end of equilibration period the stabilization of the tissue contractile<br>
response was assessed with 1µmol/L of Carbachol consecutively for 2-3 times. Subsequently a<br>
cumulative concentration response curve to carbachol (10-9 mol/L to 3 X 10-5 mol/L) was<br>
obtained. After several washes, once the baseline was achieved, cumulative concentration<br>
response curve was obtained in presence of NCE (NCE added 20 min. prior to the second CRC).<br>
The contractile results were expressed as % of control E max. ED50 values were calculated by<br>
fitting a non-linear regression curve (Graph Pad Prism). pKB values were calculated by the<br>
formula pKB = - log [ (molar concentration of antagonist/ (dose ratio-1))]<br>
where,<br>
dose ratio = ED50 in the presence of antagonist/ED50 in the absence of antagonist.<br>
In vivo experiments using anaesthetized rabbit<br>
Methodology<br>
Male rabbits were anaesthetized with urethane 1.5g/kg intravenously. Trachea was cannulated to<br>
maintain the patency of airway. Femoral vein and femoral arteries of both sides were cannulated for the administration of vehicle or drug substances for the measurement of BP and administration of carbachol intra-arterially respectively.<br>
Polyethylene tubing was introduced into the bladder through the urethra and tied at the neck of the bladder. The other end of the catheter was connected to the Grass polygraph through a Statham<br>
pressure transducer. The bladder was filled with warm (37°C) saline. Both the ureters were ligated and cut proximally to drain the urine coming from kidneys. A stabilization period of 30-60 was allowed for stabilization of parameters from surgical procedures.<br>
Salivary response was assessed by measuring the weight of a preweighted cotton gauze kept for 2 minutes in the buccal cavity immediately after the carbachol challenge.<br>
At the end of stabilization period 2 control responses to carbachol (1.5µg/kg intra-arterial) on bladder pressure and salivation were obtained and this response was considered as 100%. Subsequently, the effect of increasing dose of NCE (ranging from 3 µg/kg to 1mg/kg) or vehicle (i.v., 15 min before carbachol challenge) was examined.<br><br><br>
The change in bladder pressure and salivation were expressed as % change from pretreatment<br>
control averages. The ID50 values for salivation and bladder pressure inhibition were calculated<br>
using Graph Pad Prism software, by fitting the values at dose into non-linear regression curve.<br>
Oxybutynin and Tolterodine were used as standards for comparison.<br>
The bladder selectivity to salivation was calculated by using following formula and expressed as<br>
fold of selectivity of oxybutinin in the same model.<br>
