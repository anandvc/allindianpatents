BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1) Field of the invention<br>
[0004] The present invention relates to the preparation of poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) as a copolymer with a cyclic ester in a melt. In particular, the present invention relates to a reactive extrusion process for bulk copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one and the cyclic ester using an organometallic polymerization agent (catalyst or initiator) , particularly a coordination insertion catalyst, to form a polymer with a high molecular weight with good control over molecular weight. In particular, the present invention relates to a reactive extrusion process for bulk copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one copolymerized with a limited amount of comonomer which is the cyclic ester, particularly a 1actone or dilactone, using a coordination-insertion agent, to form an aliphatic copolyester with good control over molecular weights and conversion, and<br><br>
with improved thermal properties  for use as biodegradable plastics.<br>
[0005] More specifically, the present invention relates to a continuous extrusion polymerization process of 1,4-dioxan-2-one and the cyclic ester to produce high molecular weights at high throughputs. The present invention also relates to a continuous extrusion polymerisation process of 1,4-dioxan-2-one copolymerized with a limited amount of the cyclic ester to produce high molecular weight aliphatic copolyester with fraction of the cyclic ester in the polymer of than 5 wt %, preferably 3 wt %, at high throughputs. The present invention also relates to the manufacture of semi-crystalline poly (1,4-dioxan-2-one) copolymer with improved thermal properties and thermal stability. The present invention also relates to compositions derived by reactive extrusion polymerization process, which are useful in making biodegradable articles and specially related to a unique intermediate that exhibits branching.<br>
(2)Description of the related art<br>
[0006]    1,4-Dioxan-2-one is known to be polymerized readily in bulk  (absence  of any solvent)  using organometallic or enzymatic catalysis  such as  tin  (II)  bis  (2-ethylhexanoic acid),   diethylzinc,   triethylaluminium,   Zn   lactate   and derivatives of Ti,  Zr and Hg (Snapp, H. et al. US Pat. No 3,645,941, Bezwada, R. et al. US Pat. No 4,643,191, Schultz, H. US Pat. No 3,063,967, Bagget, J. et al. US Pat. 3,391,126, Doddi,  N.  et al.  U.S.  Pat.  No 4,032,988,  Kricheldorf,  H. Macromol. Symp. 130: 393 (1998), Nishida, H. at al. J. Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry 38: 1560 (2000)). However, as a result of the dynamic chemical equilibrium between 1,4-<br><br>
dioxan-2-one (PDX) and poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) above the melting point of the polymer, conversion of monomer is typically limited to about 78%. Removal or recovery of unreacted monomer from the melt is difficult because of the tendency, given this dynamic equilibrium, of the polymer to depolymerize or lose molecular weight as the monomer is removed to maintain the equilibrium monomer content. [0007] U.S. Patent No. 5,717,059 describes a method for removing the PDX monomer from previously solidified polymerizing mixture without any adverse degradation reactions to form high molecular weight polymers. However, the time for removing the unreacted monomer from the polymerizing mixture was on the order of hours. The process used to manufacture high molecular weight 1,4-dioxan-2-one polymers is extremely time-consuming and cost-expensive.<br>
[0008] Thermal stabilized poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) polymers have also been prepared by end-capping the extremity of poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) in the melt. However, after end-capping of the poly (1,4-dioxan-2-one) extremity by a chemical agent such as pyromellitic anhydride, the reacting mixture still contains a large amount of unreacted monomer, which has to be removed from poly (1,4-dioxan-2-one) and recycled, making the process economically unattractive (U.S. Patent No. 5,652,331). [0009] To permit commercial scale-up of the polymerization without adversely affecting process economics, it is necessary to provide an appropriate, inexpensive and easy process to manufacture thermal stabilized poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) with conversion close to completion as well as a corresponding process for manufacturing it in order to achieve an inexpensive and integrated production with high volumes.<br><br>
[00010] It is highly desirable to carry out the polymerization reaction in the melt rather than in solution for environmental concern and unfavorable economics related to the use of organic solvents. Further, bulk polymerization can be conducted in extruders, making it a continuous process. Polystyrenes and nylons have been produced commercially by polymerization in an extruder. A number of patents have evolved in the extrusion of these polymers; the process schematics and screw configurations vary considerably. The extruder screw configuration can improve yield, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and product throughput. [00011] Reactive extrusion is an attractive route for polymer processing in order to carry out various reactions including polymerization, grafting, branching and functionalization. Reactive extrusion polymerization involves polymerizing a liquid/solid monomer or pre-polymer within the residence time available in the extruder to form a high molecular weight melt.<br>
[00012] The prior art has shown that extruders can be used for bulk polymerizations of monomers like methylmethacrylate, styrene, lactam, e-caprolactone and lactide (Michaeli, W. et al., J. of Appl. Polymer Sci. 48:871-886 (1993); Kye, H., et at., J. of Appl. Polymer Sci. 52:1249-1262 (1994), U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,005 and U.S. Pat. No. 5, 906,7 83) . The economics of using the extruder for bulk polymerization are favorable when high throughputs and control of molecular weight are realized. [00013] Low cost production and processing methods for biodegradable plastics are of great importance since they enhance the commercial viability and cost-competitiveness of these materials. Reactive extrusion is an attractive route for the  copolymerization  of  1,4-dioxan-2-one  as  well  as  its<br><br>
copolymerization, without solvents, to produce high molecular<br>
weight biodegradable plastics.<br>

[00015] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the bulk copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one and a cyclic ester via a coordination-insertion mechanism using catalysts and/or initiators, to form a high molecular weight polymer. Specifically, it is an object of the<br><br>
invention to provide an extrusion process for the copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one and a cyclic ester using coordination-insertion catalysts and initiators such as aluminum alkoxides.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00016] The present invention relates to a process wherein the copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one, using a coordination-insertion catalyst, is conducted with a limited amount (20 mole percent or less based upon 1,4-dioxane-2-one) of cyclic ester to form high molecular weight, and with conversion in unreacted 1,4-dioxane-2-one monomer of less than 3 wt %. Specifically, the comonomer includes lactones like e-caprolactone, 5-valerolactone, p-butyrolactone and y-butyrolactone or dilactone like lactide and glycolide. As used herein, "poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one)" shall refer to polymers comprising 1,4-dioxan-2-one units with up to about 4 0 mole percent other cyclic ester units.<br>
[00017] The present invention also relates to the manufacture of semi-crystalline poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) and cyclic ester copolymers with good thermal properties and improved thermal stability. Specifically, the present invention relates to prevent depolymerization reactions, both during the polymerization process as well as during subsequent treatments of the melt. The present invention also relates to composition derived by reactive extrusion polymerization process, which are useful in making biodegradable articles, and preferentially relates to a unique intermediate polymer that exhibits chain branching.<br>
[00018]   The present invention thus relates to a process for forming poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) copolymer with a cyclic ester<br><br>
monomer, the improvement, which comprises: (i) providing a reactant mixture comprising 1, 4-clioxan-2-one and a cyclic ester monomer each containing less than 100-ppm water and having an acid value less than 0.5 mg KOH/g, and an organometallic polymerization agent into a blending means, in the absence of a solvent; and (ii) blending the reactant mixture at a temperature between about 80° and 240°C to form the poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one).<br>
[00019] The present invention also relates to a process for forming poly (1,4-dioxan-2-one) and cyclic ester monomer copolymer, which comprises: (i) introducing a reactant mixture comprising 1,4-dioxan-2-one containing less than 100-ppm water and having an acid value less than 0.5 mg KOH/g, and a cyclic ester monomer containing less than 100-ppm water and having an acid value less than 0.5 mg KOH/g, and an organometallic polymerization agent into an extruder, in the absence of a solvent; and (ii) extruding the reactant mixture at a temperature between about 80° and 240°C to form the poly(l,4-dioxan-2-one) cyclic ester monomer copolymer.<br>
[00020] The present invention further relates to a process for forming a poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) and cyclic ester copolymer blended with additional ingredients, which comprises: (i) introducing a reactant mixture comprising 1,4-dioxan-2-one and a cyclic ester monomer each containing less than 100-ppm water and having an acid value less than 0.5 mg KOH/g, and an organometallic polymerization agent into an extruder, in the absence of a solvent; (ii) blending the reactant mixture at a temperature between about 80° and 240°C to form the poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) and cyclic ester copolymer; and (ii) admixing additional ingredients to the poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one)  and cyclic ester copolymer selected from the<br><br>
group consisting of polymers, fillers and plasticizers. [00021]   The present invention also relates to an anhydrous poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) copolymer with a cyclic ester monomer comprised of a structure formula:<br><br>
wherein M is a metal selected from the group consisting of tin, titanium, zinc, aluminum, zirconium, and samarium and mixtures thereof; z is an integer between 1 and 4 representing a number of arms on M, attached to M; n is a number related to the degree of polymerization, which is between about zero and 2000 and which may be different for each arm, z; and R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyls and substituted alkyls containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, wherein the copolymer contains less than 5% of the polymerized cyclic ester monomer.<br>
[00022] Furthermore, the anhydrous poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) (co) polymer intermediate can contain up to 20 mol% unit of cyclic ester. Specifically, the present invention relates to a process to synthesize high molecular weight 1,4-dioxan-2-one by ring-opening polymerization using an organometallic polymerization agent, wherein the polymerization is conducted in the absence of solvent for the monomer, and an extruder or similar equipment is used for the polymerization, and wherein the polymerization agents function by coordination-insertion mechanism. Specifically, the present invention relates to a reactive extrusion process to synthesize high molecular weight poly(1,4-dioxan-2~one)   copolymers   using   catalysts   and<br><br>
initiators like aluminum alkoxides that have been used as is or derived in situ from alkyl aluminum. Specifically, the present invention relates to a reactive extrusion process to synthesize high molecular weight and thermal stabilized aliphatic polyesters by polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one copolymerized with a limited amount of cyclic ester using catalysts and initiators like aluminum alkoxides that have been used as is or derived in situ from alkyl aluminum. To prepare high molecular weight polymer, it is desirable to use 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer, which has a high purity of at least about 98%. Such purity can generally be achieved by distillation of impurities from the monomer.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[00023]   Trace amounts of water and free acid in the monomer were unexpectedly found to affect the kinetics of the reactive extrusion  polymerization.  It  is  hence  important  to  this invention that the 1,4-dioxan-2-one and cyclic ester contain less  than  100-ppm  water  by  weight.  It  is  a  preferred embodiment of the invention that the 1,4-dioxan-2-one and/or cyclic ester also have an acid value less than 0.5 rag KOH/g, and preferably less than 0.2 mg KOH/g.  1,4-Dioxan-2-one or cyclic ester was dried using molecular sieves by a setup shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows a system for drying of a monomer. Wet  monomer  is  introduced via  the  neck  in  a previously nitrogen-purged  round-bottom  flask  under  nitrogen.   The peristaltic pump supplied the monomer via the line through a column filled with molecular sieves. The monomer is extracted from unexpected dusts from molecular sieves using the filter, and returned to the round-bottom flask via the line.  The drying step is cyclically performed for at least 72 hours.<br><br>
Specifically, 1,4-dioxan-2-one is heated above its melting point close to 28 °C during this drying step. The preferred molecular sieve is Type 3 A from Aldrich, USA.<br>
[00024]   The polymers are optionally blended and grafted with secondary components that are useful in making polymer, resin, specifically biodegradable  articles,  and more  specifically biodegradable films. These biodegradable compositions derived from the aforementioned novel processes may be used as is or be subsequently admixed with other components like fillers, additives  and  other  polymers.  Specifically,  the  present invention  relates  to  biodegradable  compositions  based  on poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) copolymerized with a limited amount of cyclic  ester  as  derived  by  aforementioned  polymerization process.   Specifically,   the  present  invention  provides macromolecular  designs  including  linear,  star,  dendrimer, graft structures, and more preferentially, branch structures based on poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) copolymerized with a limited amount of cyclic ester copolymer as derived by aforementioned polymerization process.  Specifically,  the present invention relates  to  biodegradable  compositions  based  on  poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one)  copolymerized with a limited amount of cyclic ester as derived by aforementioned polymerization process with other components like fillers,  plasticizers,  additives and other polymers, wherein these are preferably selected from the group consisting starch, modified or not, copolymer of maleic anhydride   and  polycaprolactone,   ethylene-vinyl   acetate copolymer,   poly (vinyl  alcohol),   ethylene  vinyl  alcohol copolymer, polylactide,  organic peroxide,  and a mixture of peroxide and maleic anhydride.<br><br>
[00025] The components of the reaction mixture that are employed in the process that is within the scope of this invention, derive compositions which include the following:<br>
(I)	cyclic  ester  copolymerized  with  1,4-dioxan-2-one,<br>
containing a high purity of at least about 98%, and<br>
less than 50-ppm water that polymerize to form high<br>
molecular weight, and<br>
(II)	the polymerizing agent  (catalyst and/or initiator),<br>
such  as  Lewis  acid  catalyst,  metal  alkyl,  metal<br>
alkoxides and mixtures of these to catalyze or initiate<br>
polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one copolymerized with a<br>
cyclic ester, as in (I), in the range of 0.001 to 5% by<br>
weight of the total reaction mixture.<br>
1,4-Dioxan-2-one, as outlined in (I) above, which is to be copolymerized to form high molecular weight polymer contains less than 2% impurities. This level of impurities can be achieved by distillation of crude 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer. 1,4-dioxan-2-one, which is to be polymerized to form high molecular weight polymer, also contains less than 100-ppm water and having an acid value less than 0.5 mg KOH/g, and preferably less than 0.2 mg KOH/g. The presence of water and free acid in the reactant mixture has a deleterious effect on the kinetics, and ultimately leads to lower conversion of monomer to polymer in the synthesis of high molecular weight poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) polymer or high molecular weight copolymer based on 1,4-dioxan-2-one by reactive extrusion polymerization. It has been observed that these impurities interact with the polymerization catalyst or the propagating species, and lower the overall rate of polymerization. In cases where both monomers contain greater amounts than 100-ppm<br><br>
water, the desired water content may be achieved by any of the drying techniques known in the art, the preferred method being the use of molecular sieves (physical method) or calcium hydride (chemical method) . The extent of free acid in the reactant varies according to the purity of the monomer grades available.<br>
[00026]   The  choice  of  the  type  and  amount  of  the polymerizable cyclic ester, as outlined in (I) above, is based on biodegradability,  compatibility considerations,  molecular weight,  melt viscosity,  mechanical  and thermal properties, processability, hydrophobicity and cost. The more important amongst these are biodegradability, hydrophobicity, mechanical and thermal properties and compatibility considerations. [00027]   In accordance with the invention, the cyclic ester of choice are non-substituted lactones like s-caprolactone, 5-valerolactone,  (3-propiolactone,  ybutyrolactone,  substituted lactones like (3-butyrolactone, (3-valerolactone, and the like, lactides,  glycolide,  cyclic  anhydrides  such  as  adipic anhydride,  and cyclic carbonates.  It is preferred that the incorporation of a limited amount of cyclic ester enhances the thermal  stability  of  poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one)   chains.   In particular, the incorporation of cyclic ester either random or sequential and/or both,  prevents depolymerization reactions both during the polymerization process  as  well  as  during subsequent treatment of the melt.  It is preferred that the incorporation of cyclic ester increases the monomer-to-polymer conversion.  It is also preferred that the incorporation of cyclic  ester  does  not  alter  the  semi-crystallinity  of poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) polymer. Specifically, it is preferred that the melting point of the copolymer be close to that of homopoly(1,4-dioxan-2-one). It is further preferred that the<br><br>
incorporation of cyclic ester leads to an internal plasticization. The term internal plasticization is used when 1,4-dioxan-2-one is copolymerized with cyclic ester whose homopolymer has a glass transition temperature (Tg) lower than that of poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one). One of these advantages of internal plasticization is the increase in the range of application temperatures. The preferred monomers within the scope of this invention that are to be polymerized are e-caprolactone and 5-valerolactone. It is further preferred that s-caprolactone and 5-valerolactone be, ranging between 1 and preferably ranging between 5 and 20 mole percent of the total amount of 1, 4-dioxan-2-one and cyclic ester monomer in the reaction mixture. [00028]   Two classes of catalyst/initiator are preferred to<br>
carry out the aforementioned polymerization of 1,4~dioxan-2-<br>
*<br>
one or 1,4-dioxan-2-one/cyclic ester, as outlined in (II) above; one being Lewis acid catalysts such as Ti, Zn, and Sn salts more preferably stannous octoate (stannous 2-ethyl hexanoate) and the second being metal alkoxides like titanium tetrabutoxide, aluminum- tri see-butoxide, and aluminum isopropoxide. Metal alkoxides as is, and metal alkoxides generated in situ by coupling of metal alkyIs with functionals discussed above are the preferred polymerization agents. Metal alkoxides are represented as M(OR)X where M=A1, Ti, Zn, Zr, Sn and the like, and x is 1 to 4. Metal alkyls are represented as M(Alk)y where Alk=alkyl radical, linear or branched, substituted or not, with 1 to 18 carbon atoms and y is 1 to 4. Dimers, trimers, tetramers, chelates and complexes of metal alkoxides and metal alkyls are also included organometallic polymerization agents that are within the scope of the invention. Aluminum isopropoxide,  aluminum tri-sec butoxide,<br><br>
alkoxides generated in situ by using tri ethyl aluminum or di-isobutyl aluminum hydride, and mixtures thereof are the most preferred initiators for the bulk polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one or 1,4-dioxan-2-one copolymerized with a limited amount of cyclic ester, within the scope of the invention. It is preferred that the amount of such polymerization initiators/catalysts is at least about 0.001% by weight of the reaction mixture.<br>
[00029]   A schematic of the extruder is depicted in Figure 2. In a nitrogen atmosphere, previously melted 1,4-dioxan-2-one (component I) was introduced into the feed throat of a twin-screw extruder (such as Baker Perkins co-rotating twin screw extruder-MPC/V-30) at a feed rate of 2-20 Ib/hr by means of a pump.  Alternatively,  1,4-dioxan-2-one can be  introduced by means of solid metering at a feed rate of 2-20 lb/hr. The extruder screw speed was 20-300 rpm, preferably 30-150 rpm, and the extrusion temperature was between 80°C and 230 °C, preferably between 100 and 170°C, wherein the extruder was also under nitrogen gas blanketing.  A cyclic ester such as  s-caprolactone was added downstream (away from the feed throat) or  admixed  with  1,4-dioxan-2-one  (component  II)  and/or introduced as separate streams in the feed throat. The cyclic ester was separately metered by a pump at a feed rate of 0.5-5 lb/h in a nitrogen atmosphere. The appropriate polymerization agent (component III) was separately metered by a pump. Both components  (component I/II or I/II/III)  were introduced as separate streams into the feed throat. Furthermore, both feed streams (component I/II or I/II/III) can be mixed in a pre-mixer, heated or notf  and then be introduced in the feed throat.  A die  was  used to  extrude  the  polymer  product. Downstream from the feed throat, other feed section may be<br><br>
provided for optional additives like plasticizers,  fillers, reaction terminators or other additives.<br>
[00030] The extruder conditions were set to control the polymerization temperature to be at least 80°C, preferably with residence times up to 12 minutes. The choice of appropriate screw configurations in the extruder is chosen to provide complete conversion of monomer, high molecular weight, favorable kinetics, and control over the resulting molecular weight. For example, it has been shown that the use of high shear zones is beneficial in molecular weight of nylon. However, it is not the case of e-caprolactone polymerization for which a high shear process results in heat generation leading to side reactions that give a loss in molecular weight (US. Pat. No 5,969,089 and US. Pat. No 5,906,783). Figure 1 shows the preferred screw configuration for the bulk (co)polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one that was employed close to that used for bulk polymerization of e-caprolactone. The screw configuration is entirely made up of conveying screw elements, which ensures near plug flow conditions with minimal back mixing.<br>
[00031] The process scheme outlined above is used to derive polymer compositions, especially biodegradable compositions like pellets, films, sheets, molding, foams, and fibers starting from poly (1,4-dioxan-2-one), as a copolymer with a cyclic ester, more particularly, a copolymer from 1,4-dioxan-2-one and s-caprolactone. The molecular weight depends upon the desired application but will typically range from about 50,000 to about 300,000 for each arm.<br>
[00032] The following equation represents the evolution of the resulting branched structure from the (co)polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one with up to 4 arms  (depending upon the<br><br>
metal) or more depending on the polymerization agent as derived by bulk (co)polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one via a coordination-insertion mechanism in an extruder. On the account of the branched nature of polymer, high molecular weight compositions with high melt viscosities and good melt processing characteristics were easily synthesized.<br><br>
Blends  of  the  reactive  extruded  poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) copolymers,   preferably  branched,   with   other  polymers, plasticizers and fillers are also included within the scope of this  invention.   Such  a  blend  composition  using  the aforementioned  aliphatic  (co)polyester  obtained  by  ring-opening polymerization comprises one or more of the following: (A) optionally,  other polymers,  including those based on lactones,  lactides, and glycolide,  substituted or not, polyorthoesters,    polymers    and    copolymers    of hydroxybutyrate  and  hydroxyvalerate,  poly(alkylene  d-tartrate),  vinyl polymers  like poly  (vinyl  alcohol), poly(vinyl acetate),  ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene-vinyl  acetate  copolymer,  polyanhydrides  like polyadipic    anhydride,    polycarbonates,    proteins, polysaccharides like starches and cellulosics including cellulose,  cellulose  acetate,  cellulose butyrate,  and cellulose  propionate,  lignocellulose,  starch,  starch esters and amylose esters, each of these being in a form that is granular, plasticized, destructurized,  solvated<br><br>

The branching or cross-linking is conducted separately or in situ by a peroxide initiation;  copolymers includes copolymers of lactones,  lactides,  and glycolide,  substituted or not with  each  other  and  graft  copolymers  of  lactones, lactides, and glycolide, substituted or not with various functional  monomers  like  maleic  anhydride,  stearic anhydride,   ethylene  oxide,   aliphatic  and  aromatic isocyanates, and acrylic acid, wherein the grafting of these functional monomers is conducted separately or in situ, preferably by peroxide initiated grafting in an extruder, and wherein the amount of grafted monomer is at least   0.1%  with  respect   to  the  main  polymer; functionalization of lactones, lactides, and glycolide, substituted or not related to end-capping these polymers with suitable functional groups like unsaturated groups, isocyanate groups and the like.<br>
[00033] Of these, the preferred polymers are those that are biodegradable, such as those based on proteins, polysaccharides as described above, polymers of lactones, lactides, and glycolide, substituted or not, aliphatic polyesters, polyamides and polyester amides, and mixture thereof, each of these being hydrophobic or not, modified or not as in branched, cross-linked, copolymerized, functionalized,  surface-modified,  physically  or  chemically<br><br>
modified in other similar ways. The preferred amount of these polymers in the final composition is in the range of 10 to 90% by weight, and<br>

[00034] The following non-limiting procedures and examples are used to further describe the invention and illustrate some of the highlights of the invention.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
Reactive extrusion process for bulk polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer using Aluminum Tri-sec Butoxide (aluminum<br>
alkoxide)<br>
[00035] The polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer using aluminum tri-sec butoxide (aluminum alkoxides) by a coordination insertion mechanism via reactive extrusion is described. 1,4-dioxan-2-one was dried over 3 Angstrom molecular sieves prior to being introduced in the extruder as shown in Figure 2. A 5-wt % solution of aluminum tri-sec butoxide in dry toluene was prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere. A Baker Perkins co-rotating twin- screw extruder (with the screw configuration of Figure 1) was used for the polymerization process and was set to a barrel temperature of 130°C.  Monomer and catalysts  solutions were  introduced as<br><br>
separate streams in the feed throat of the extruder using a peristaltic pump. The previously melted monomer feed was 23.23 g/min. The polymerization agent feed rate was 0.405 g/min corresponding to a theoretical molecular weight of 94,550 for each arm. The extruder screw speed used was 130 rpm resulting .in a mean residence time greater than 1 min. The extrudate was cooled down to room temperature. The polymer was recovered by hot solubilization of crude polymerizing mixture in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, precipitation into 7 volumes of heptane, filtration and drying until a constant weight. The conversion was 65% as determined by gravimetry, and the intrinsic viscosity was 0.77 dl/g as determined by viscosimetry in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane/phenol (3:2 in volume) at 25°C. This limited conversion is in perfect agreement with the expected value based on the monomer/polymer theoretical equilibrium (about 34% monomer in equilibrium).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>

A 5-wt % solution of aluminum tri-sec butoxide in dry toluene was prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere- A Baker Perkins co-rotating twin-screw extruder<br><br>
(with the screw configuration of Figure 1) was used for the polymerization process and was set to a barrel temperature of 130°C.  Monomers  and catalyst solutions were  introduced as separate streams in the feed throat of the extruder using peristaltic pumps. The previously melted 1,4-dioxan-2-one feed rate was 23.23 g/min. The feed rate of £-caprolactone was 2.37 g/min.  The polymerization agent feed rate was  0.405 g/min corresponding to a theoretical molecular weight of 104,200 for each arm. The extruder screw speed used was 130 rpm resulting in a mean residence time greater than 1 min. The extrudate was cooled down to room temperature. The conversion was 99% (cf. Example 1),  and the intrinsic viscosity was  0.65 dl/g as determined by viscosimetry in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane/phenol (3:2 in volume)  at 25°C.  The exact molar fraction of e-caprolactone was 0.11 as determined in C2D2CI4 by 1E NMR (300 MHz) .<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Reactive extrusion process for bulk copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer with an imposed molar fraction in s-caprolactone  of  0.11  using  Aluminum  Tri-sec  Butoxide (aluminum alkoxide)<br>
[00037] The polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer using aluminum tri-sec butoxide (aluminum alkoxides) by a coordination insertion mechanism via reactive extrusion is described. 1,4-dioxan-2-one and s-caprolactone were dried over 3 Angstrom molecular sieves prior to being introduced in the extruder as shown in Figure 3. A 5-wt % solution of aluminum tri-sec butoxide in dry toluene was prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere. A Baker Perkins co-rotating twin-screw extruder<br><br>
(with the screw configuration of Figure 1) was used for the polymerization process and was set to a barrel temperature of 130°C.  Monomer  and  catalyst  solutions  were  introduced  as separate streams in the feed throat of the extruder using peristaltic pumps. The previously melted 1,4-dioxan-2-one feed rate was 23.23 g/min. The feed rate of s-caprolactone was 3.29 g/min.  The polymerization agent feed rate was 0.405 g/min corresponding to a theoretical molecular weight of 107,950 for each arm. The extruder screw speed used was 130 rpm resulting in a mean residence time greater than 1 min. The extrudate was cooled down to room temperature. The conversion was 97% (of. Example 1),  and the intrinsic viscosity was  0.55 dl/g as determined by viscosimetry in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane/phenol (3:2 in volume)  at 25°C.  The exact molar fraction of  e-caprolactone was 0.16 as determined in C2D2CI4 by 1E NMR (300 MHz) .<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Reactive extrusion process for bulk copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer with an imposed molar fraction in e-caprolactone of 0.16 using Aluminum Tri-sec Butoxide (aluminum alkoxide)<br>
[00038] The polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one monomer using aluminum tri-sec butoxide (aluminum alkoxides) by a coordination insertion mechanism via reactive extrusion is described. 1,4-dioxan-2-one and s-caprolactone were dried over 3 Angstrom molecular sieves prior to being introduced in the extruder as shown in Figure 3. A 5-wt % solution of aluminum tri-sec butoxide in dry toluene was prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere. A Baker Perkins co-rotating twin-screw extruder<br><br>
(with the screw configuration of Figure 1) was used for the polymerization process and was set to a barrel temperature of 130°C.  Monomer and catalysts  solutions  were  introduced as separate streams in the feed throat of the extruder using peristaltic pumps. The previously melted 1,4-dioxan-2-one feed rate was 23.23 g/min. The feed rate of e-caprolactone was 5.18 g/min.  The polymerization agent feed rate was 0,602 g/min corresponding to a theoretical molecular weight of 77,550 for each arm. The extruder screw speed used was 130 rpm resulting in a mean residence time greater than 1 min. The extrudate was cooled down to room temperature. The conversion was 99%, and the  intrinsic  viscosity  was  0.38  dl/g  as  determined  by viscosimetry  in  1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane/phenol   (3:2  in volume) at 25°C. The exact molar fraction of £-caprolactone was 0.24 as determined in C2D2C14 by XH NMR (300 MHz). [00039]   Comparison of Example 1 to Examples 2,  3 and 4 demonstrates the beneficial effect of using relatively small amounts  of  £-caprolactone  monomer  in  achieving  complete conversion of monomer to high molecular weight polymer in a short residence time.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Dependency of weight loss on the composition of £-caprolactone into 1,4-dioxan-2-one (co)polymer<br>
[00040] Isothermal thermogravimetric analyses were taken using 1,4-dioxan-2-one copolymer (Examples 2,3,4) compared to 1,4-dioxan-2-one homopolymer (Example 1), which were extracted from aluminum residues. The aluminum residues were extracted by successively washing the organic layer with an aqueous solution of EDTA (0.1 M) and using deionized water twice. The<br><br>
time-dependence of weight loss was performed at 180°C under helium atmosphere (Table 1) .<br><br><br><br><br><br>
alter the melting temperature with regard to the homopoly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) (Table 1, entry 1) . Furthermore, an interesting internal plasticization effect increases the range in service temperatures from -11°C to -22°C.<br>
