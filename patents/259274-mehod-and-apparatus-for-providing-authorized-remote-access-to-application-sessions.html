METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING AUTHORIZED REMOTE<br>
ACCESS TO APPLICATION SESSIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing<br>
authorized remote access to a plurality of application sessions and, in particular,<br>
to a method and apparatus for providing authorized remote access to a plurality<br>
of application sessions implementing enhanced security.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Technologies for providing remote access to networked resources<br>
include a variety of server/client software combinations. MetaFrameâ„¢ server<br>
software in communication with Intelligent Computing Architecture (ICA) clients,<br>
available from Citrix Systems, Inc., Ft Lauderdale, Florida, and X Servers in<br>
communication with X Windows clients available from the X Consortium are two<br>
examples that provide remote access to applications executing on a server.<br>
	Computer user behavior and the stability of network communication<br>
channels over which their computers communicate are often unpredictable.<br>
Networked users on occasion need to change computing environments while<br>
forgetting to, or without having the opportunity to fully save their work product or<br>
to shut down their systems. In other cases, communication channels<br>
unexpectedly fail or computers crash, which can result in the loss of work<br>
product, if the session is not restored or terminated gracefully.<br>
	When a computer user changes from one computing environment to<br>
another, access control decisions may change. Existing methods fail to provide<br>
smooth reconnection of the user to sessions where access does not change<br>
while maintaining unauthorized sessions for future reconnection when the user<br>
returns to an authorized environment. A method that detects shifts in computing<br>
environments, identifies changes in access control rights stemming from such<br>
shifts, and reconnects the user only to authorized sessions would be desirable.<br>

WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus providing<br>
authorized remote access to a plurality of application sessions implementing<br>
enhanced security.<br>
	In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for providing authorized<br>
remote access to a plurality (e.g., two or more) of application sessions includes<br>
receiving information associated with a user. A collection agent gathers the<br>
information and transmits it to a policy engine. The policy engine makes an<br>
access control decision based on the received information. in one embodiment,<br>
the policy engine also identifies a plurality of application sessions already<br>
associated with the user in response to the information. The method also<br>
includes connecting a client node operated by the user to the identified plurality<br>
of application sessions in response to the received information. In some<br>
embodiments, there can be multiple applications sessions, and some of the<br>
multiple applications sessions can be running on multiple servers.<br>
	In another aspect, the invention relates to a method and an apparatus for<br>
granting authorized access to resources. The apparatus comprises a policy<br>
engine including two components. The first component receives information<br>
about a client node and generates a data set from the information. The second<br>
component receives the data set, and provides to the first component an<br>
enumeration of resources available to the client based on the received data set.<br>
The first component presents the enumeration of resources to the client node.<br>
	In one embodiment, the first component receives the information from a<br>
collection agent. In one embodiment, each component further comprises a<br>
database. The database in the first component stores conditions. The database<br>
in the second component stores policies. The first component applies the<br>
conditions to the received information and the second component applies the<br>
policies to the received data set. In this embodiment, the policies determine the<br>
application sessions that the client node may access.<br>

WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
allows the client node 102 to participate in a distributed computer system model<br>
(i.e., a server-based computing model).<br>
	For embodiments in which the client node 102 is a mobile device, the<br>
device may be a JAVA-enabled cellular telephone, such as the i50sx, i55sr,<br>
i58sr, i85s, i88s, i90c, i95cl, or the im11000, all of which are manufactured by<br>
Motorola Corp. of Schaumburg, Illinois, the 6035 or the 7135, manufactured by<br>

4255, all of which manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Corporation of Palo Alto,<br>
California, the ViewSonic V36, manufactured by ViewSonic of Walnut,<br>
California, or the Toshiba PocketPC e405, manufactured by Toshiba America,<br>
Inc. of New York, New York. In still other embodiments, the client node is a<br>
combination PDA/telephone device such as the Treo 180, Treo 270 or Treo 600,<br>
all of which are manufactured by palmOne, Inc. of Milpitas, California. In still<br>
further embodiments, the client node 102 is a cellular telephone that operates<br>
under control of the PocketPC operating system, such as the MPx200,<br>
manufactured by Motorola Corp.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 1D, one embodiment of a computer network 100<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention is depicted, which includes a client<br>
node 102, a collection agent 104, a policy engine 106, a policy database 108, an<br>
application server farm 114, and an application server 116. Although only one<br>
client node 102, collection agent 104, policy engine 106, application server farm<br>
114, and application server 116 are depicted in the embodiment shown in Figure<br>
1D, it should be understood that the system may provide multiple ones of any or<br>
each of those components. For example, in one embodiment, the system 100<br>
includes multiple, logically-grouped application server 116, each of which are<br>
available to execute applications on behalf of a client node 102. In these<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
embodiments, the logical group of servers may be referred to as a "server farm."<br>
In some of these embodiments, the servers may be geographically dispersed.<br>
	In brief overview, when the client node 102 transmits a request 110 to the<br>
policy engine 106 for access to a resource, the collection agent 104<br>
communicates with client node 102, retrieving information about the client node<br>
102, and transmits the client node information 112 to the policy engine 106. The<br>
policy engine 106 makes an access control decision by applying a policy from<br>
the policy database 108 to the received information 112.<br>
	In more detail, the client node 102 transmits a request 110 for a resource<br>
to the policy engine 106. In some embodiments, the client node 102 transmits<br>
the request 110 over a network connection. The network can be a local area<br>
network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network<br>
(WAN) such as the Internet. The client node 102 and the policy engine 106 may<br>
connect to a network through a variety of connections including standard<br>
telephone lines, LAN or WAN links (e.g., T1, T3, 56 kb, X.25), broadband<br>
connections (ISDN, Frame Relay, ATM), and wireless connections.<br>
	Connections between the client node 102 and the policy engine 106 may use a<br>
variety of data-link layer communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, IPX, SPX,<br>
NetBIOS, NetBEUI, SMB. Ethernet, ARCNET, Fiber Distributed Data Interface<br>
(FDDI), RS232, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.11a, IEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g and<br>
direct asynchronous connections).<br>
	Upon receiving the request, the policy engine 106 initiates information<br>
gathering by the collection agent 104. The collection agent 104 gathers<br>
information regarding the client node 102 and transmits the information 112 to<br>
the policy engine 106.<br>
	In some embodiments, the collection agent 104 gathers and transmits the<br>
information 112 over a network connection. In some embodiments, the<br>
collection agent 104 comprises bytecode, such as an application written in the<br>
bytecode programming language JAVA. In some embodiments, the collection<br>
agent 104 comprises at least one script. In those embodiments, the collection<br>
agent 104 gathers information by running at least one script on the client node<br>
102. In some embodiments, the collection agent comprises an Active X control<br>
on the client node 102. An Active X control is a specialized COM (Component<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
Object Model) object that implements a set of interfaces that enable it to look<br>
and act like a control.<br>
	In some embodiments, the collection agent 104 executes on the client<br>
node. In other embodiments, the collection agent 104 resides on the policy<br>
engine 106. In still other embodiments, the collection agent 104 resides on a<br>
server. In other embodiments, the policy engine 106 resides on the server. In<br>
some of these embodiments, the collection agent 104 resides on both the policy<br>
engine 106 and the server.<br>
	In one embodiment, the policy engine 106 transmits the collection agent<br>
104 to the client node 102. In one embodiment, the policy engine 106 requires a<br>
second execution of the collection agent 104 after the collection agent 104. has<br>
transmitted information 112 to the policy engine 106. In this embodiment, the<br>
policy engine 106 may have insufficient information 112 to determine whether<br>
the client node 102 satisfies a particular condition. In other embodiments, the<br>
policy engine 106 requires a plurality of executions of the collection agent 104 in<br>
response to received information 112.<br>
	In some embodiments, the policy engine 106 transmits instructions to the<br>
collection agent 104 determining the type of information the collection agent 104<br>
gathers. In those embodiments, a system administrator may configure the<br>
instructions transmitted to the collection agent 104 from the policy engine 106.<br>
This provides greater control over the type of information collected. This also<br>
expands the types of access control decisions, which the policy engine 106 can<br>
make, due to the greater control over the type of information collected. The<br>
collection agent 104 gathers information 112 including, without limitation,<br>
machine ID of the client node, operating system type, existence of a patch to an<br>
operating system, MAC addresses of installed network cards, a digital<br>
watermark on the client device, membership in an Active Directory, existence of<br>
a virus scanner, existence of a personal firewall, an HTTP header, browser type,<br>
device type, network connection information, and authorization credentials.<br>
	In some embodiments, the device type is a personal digital assistant. In<br>
other embodiments, the device type is a cellular telephone. In other<br>
embodiments, the device type is a laptop computer. In other embodiments, the<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
device type is a desktop computer. In other embodiments, the device type is an<br>
Internet kiosk.<br>
	In some embodiments, the digital watermark includes data embedding.<br>
In some embodiments, the watermark comprises a pattern of data inserted into<br>
a file to provide source information about the file. I n other embodiments, the<br>
watermark comprises data hashing files to provide tamper detection. In other<br>
embodiments, the watermark provides copyright information about the file.<br>
	In some embodiments, the network connection information pertains to<br>
bandwidth capabilities. In other embodiments, the network connection<br>
information pertains to Internet Protocol address. In still other embodiments, the<br>
network connection information consists of an Internet Protocol address. In one<br>
embodiment, the network connection information comprises a network zone<br>
identifying the logon agent to which the client node provided authentication<br>
credentials.<br>
	In some embodiments, the authorization credentials include a number of<br>
types of authentication information, including without limitation, user names,<br>
client names, client addresses, passwords, PINs, voice samples, one-time<br>
passcodes, biometric data, digital certificates, tickets, etc. and combinations<br>
thereof. After receiving the gathered information 112, the policy engine 106<br>
makes an access control decision based on the received information 112.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 2, it is a block diagram of one embodiment of a<br>
policy engine 200, including a first component 202 comprising a condition<br>
database 204 and a logon agent 206, and including a second component 210<br>
comprising a policy database 212. The first component 202 applies a condition<br>
from the condition database 204 to information received about client node 102<br>
and determines whether the received information satisfies the condition.<br>
	In some embodiments, the first component 202 and the second<br>
component 210 are logically separate but not physically separate. In some<br>
embodiments, the first component 202 and the second component 210 are<br>
logically and physically separate. In some embodiments, the condition database<br>
204 resides on the first component 202. In other embodiments, the condition<br>
database 204 resides on the second component 210.<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
	In some embodiments, a condition may require that the client node 102<br>
execute a particular operating system to satisfy the condition. In some<br>
embodiments, a condition may require that the client node 102 execute a<br>
particular operating system patch to satisfy the condition. In still other<br>
embodiments, a condition may require that the client node 102 provide a MAC<br>
address for each installed network card to satisfy the condition. In some<br>
embodiments, a condition may require that the client node 102 indicate<br>
membership in a particular Active Directory to satisfy the condition, in another<br>
embodiment, a condition may require that the client node 102 execute a virus<br>
scanner to satisfy the condition. In other embodiments, a condition may require<br>
that the client node 102 execute a personal firewall to satisfy the condition. In<br>
some embodiments, a condition may require that the client node 102 comprise a<br>
particular device type to satisfy the condition. In other embodiments, a condition<br>
may require that the client node 102 establish a particular type of network<br>
connection to satisfy the condition.<br>
	If the received information satisfies a condition, the first component 202<br>
stores an identifier for that condition in a data set 208. In one embodiment, the<br>
received information satisfies a condition if the information makes the condition<br>
true. For example, a condition may require that a particular operating system be<br>
installed. If the client node 102 has that operating system, the condition is true<br>
and satisfied. In another embodiment, the received information satisfies a<br>
condition if the information makes the condition false. For example, a condition<br>
may address whether spyware exists on the client node 102. If the client node<br>
102 does not contain spyware, the condition is false and satisfied.<br>
	In some embodiments, the logon agent 206 resides outside of the policy<br>
engine 200. In other embodiments, the logon agent 206 resides on the policy<br>
engine 200. In one embodiment, the first component 202 includes a logon agent<br>
206, which initiates the information gathering about client node 102. In some<br>
embodiments, the logon agent 206 further comprises a data store. In these<br>
embodiments, the data store includes the conditions for which the collection<br>
agent may gather information. This data store is distinct from the condition<br>
database 204.<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
	In some embodiments, the logon agent 206 initiates information gathering<br>
by executing the collection agent 104. In other embodiments, the logon agent<br>
206 initiates information gathering by transmitting the collection agent 104 to the<br>
client node 102 for execution on the client node 102. In still other embodiments,<br>
the logon agent 206 initiates additional information gathering after receiving<br>
information 112. In one embodiment, the logon agent 206 also receives the<br>
information 112. In this embodiment, the logon agent 206 generates the data<br>
set 208 based upon the received information 112. In some embodiments, the<br>
logon agent 206 generates the data set 208 by applying a condition from the<br>
database 204 to the information received from the collection agent 104.<br>
	In another embodiment, the first component 202 includes a plurality of<br>
logon agents 206. In this embodiment, at least one of the plurality of logon<br>
agents 206 resides on each network domain from which a client node 102 may<br>
transmit a resource request. In this embodiment, the client node 102 transmits<br>
the resource request to a particular logon agent 206. In some embodiments, the<br>
logon agent 206 transmits to the policy engine 200 the network domain from<br>
which the client node 102 accessed the logon agent 206. In one embodiment,<br>
the network domain from which the client node 102 accesses a logon agent 206<br>
is referred to as the network zone of the client node 102.<br>
	The condition database 204 stores the conditions which the first<br>
component 202 applies to received information. The policy database 212 stores<br>
the policies, which the second component 210 applies to the received data set.<br>
In some embodiments, the condition database 204 and the policy database 212<br>
store data in an ODBC-compliant database. For example, the condition<br>
database 204 and the policy database 212 may be provided as an ORACLE<br>
database, manufactured by Oracle Corporation of Redwood Shores, Calif. In<br>
other embodiments, the condition database 204 and the policy database 212<br>
can be a Microsoft ACCESS database or a Microsoft SQL server database,<br>
manufactured by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.<br>
	After the first component 202 applies the received information to each<br>
condition in the condition database 204, the first component transmits the data<br>
set 208 to second component 210. In one embodiment, the first component 202<br>
transmits only the data set 208 to the second component 210. Therefore, in this-<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
embodiment, the second component 210 does not receive information 112, only<br>
identifiers for satisfied conditions. The second component 210 receives the data<br>
set 208 and makes an access control decision by applying a policy from the<br>
policy database 212 based upon the conditions identified within data set 208.<br>
	In one embodiment, policy database 212 stores the policies applied to the<br>
received information 112. In one embodiment, the policies stored in the policy<br>
database 212 are specified at least in part by the system administrator. In<br>
another embodiment, a user specifies at least some of the policies stored in the<br>
policy database 212. The user-specified policy or policies are stored as<br>
preferences. The policy database 212 can be stored in volatile or non-volatile<br>
memory or, for example, distributed through multiple servers.<br>
	In one embodiment, a policy allows access to a resource only if one or<br>
more conditions are satisfied. In another embodiment, a policy allows access to<br>
a resource but prohibits transmission of the resource to the client node 102.<br>
One of the policies stored in the policy database 212 might require or forbid<br>
automatic connection to disconnected application sessions. Yet another policy<br>
might make connection contingent on the client node 102 that requests access<br>
being within a secure network. Another policy might require or forbid automatic<br>
connection to active application sessions currently connected to a different client<br>
node 102. A further policy might only allow connection to application sessions<br>
after receiving user approval. Another policy might only allow connection for a<br>
predetermined time after disconnection. Still another policy only allows<br>
connection to application sessions that include specific applications. One policy<br>
might allow viewing only of the transformed contents of a requested file. A<br>
policy might allow the viewing of only an HTML version of the requested file. In<br>
some embodiments, access to a resource is provided while download of the file<br>
to the client node 102 is prevented. This may be accomplished in a number of<br>
ways, including: transformation of the file contents into a viewer-only format,<br>
transforming the file contents into HTML for viewing by a web browser, use of<br>
file type association to open the file using an application hosted by a server in a<br>
server farm instead of using an application hosted by the client node 102, or by<br>
using a system of the sort described in US Application serial number 10/931405,<br>
the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
	In some of the embodiments above, the method and apparatus provide<br>
document protection for proprietary information. In these embodiments, the<br>
client node cannot access the networked resources unless the policy engine 106<br>
grants the client node 102 permission to access the resources. In one of these<br>
embodiments, the policy engine 106 is the single exposed network element, to<br>
ensure that the client node 102 must access the policy engine 106 in. order to<br>
access the networked resources. In another of these embodiments, the URLs<br>
used to access the networked resources behind the policy engine 106 are<br>
rewritten to prevent direct access by the client node 102. In others of the<br>
embodiments above, the method and apparatus enhance the capabilities of the<br>
client node to access resource otherwise inaccessible. In some of the<br>
embodiments above, the method and apparatus provide both protection of<br>
proprietary information and enhanced client node capabilities.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 3, a flow diagram depicts one embodiment of the<br>
steps taken by the policy engine 106 to make an access control decision based<br>
upon information received about a client node 102. Upon receiving gathered<br>
information about the client node 102 (Step 350), the policy engine 106<br>
generates a data set based upon the information (Step 352). In some<br>
embodiments, the policy engine 106 requests further information about the client<br>
node 102 from the collection agent 104. In these embodiments, the policy<br>
engine 106 requires more than one execution of the collection agent 104 on the<br>
client node 102. In those embodiments, the policy engine 106 generates the<br>
data set 208 after receiving the additional requested information. In these<br>
embodiments, the policy engine 106 may have insufficient information 112 to<br>
determine whether the client node 102 satisfies a particular condition. In others<br>
of these embodiments, the conditions may be indeterminate. In some of the<br>
embodiments where the conditions are indeterminate, the collection agent could<br>
not gather the information required to satisfy the condition.<br>
	The data set 208 contains identifiers for each condition satisfied by the<br>
received information 112. Then the policy engine 106 applies a policy to each<br>
identified condition within the data set 208. That application yields an<br>
enumeration of resources which the client node 102 may access (Step 354). In<br>
one embodiment, the resources comprise proprietary data. In some<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
embodiments, the resources comprise web pages. In other embodiments, the<br>
resources comprise word processing documents. In still other embodiments, the<br>
resources comprise spreadsheets. In some embodiments, the enumeration<br>
includes only a subset of the resources that the client node 102 may access.<br>
The policy engine 106 then presents that enumeration to the client node 102. In<br>
some embodiments, the policy engine 106 creates a Hypertext Markup<br>
Language (HTML) document used to present the enumeration to the client node.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 4, one embodiment of a computer network 400<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention is depicted, which includes a client<br>
node 402, a collection agent 404, an access control server 406, a policy<br>
database 408, an application server farm 414, a first application server 416, an<br>
application database 418, a second application server 420, and a second<br>
application database 422. In some embodiments, there is a network boundary<br>
separating the network on which the client node 402 resides from the network<br>
on which the access control server 406 and application server farm 414 reside.<br>
	In brief overview, when the client node 402 transmits to the access<br>
control server 406 a request 410 for access to a resource, the collection agent<br>
404 communicates with client node 402, retrieving information about the client<br>
node 402, and transmitting client node information 412 to access control server<br>
406. In one embodiment, the client node 402 transmits the request 410 after<br>
policy engine 106 presents the client node 402 with an enumeration of available<br>
resources. The access control server 406 makes an access control decision by<br>
applying a policy from the policy database 408 to the received information 412.<br>
Finally, the access control server 406 transmits a file type to the application<br>
server farm 414 for presentation of the file contents to the client node 402.<br>
Additional components of the computer network 400 are omitted and will be<br>
described further in FIG. 4B.<br>
	Referring now to. FIG. 4B, a flow diagram depicts one embodiment of the<br>
steps taken by the access control server 406 and the application server farm<br>
414 to provide file contents to the client node 402. Part of the application server<br>
farm 414 is an application server 416.<br>
In one embodiment, once the access control server 406 decides to grant<br>
the client node 402 access to the requested file, the access control server 406<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
determines the file type for the requested file (Step 452). in other embodiments,<br>
the application server 416 determines the file type for the requested file. In still<br>
other embodiments, a server other than the application server 416 or the access<br>
control server 406. In some embodiments, the server determining the file type<br>
must first retrieve the requested file. In some of those embodiments, the file is<br>
located on the same side of the network boundary 424 as the server determining<br>
the file type. In others of those embodiments, the file is located on the same<br>
side of the network boundary 424 as the client node 402. In these<br>
embodiments, the method and apparatus enhance the capabilities of the client<br>
node to access resources otherwise inaccessible, but they do not provide<br>
document protection for proprietary information.<br>
	In some embodiments, the network boundary 424 physically separates at<br>
least two networks. In other embodiments, the network boundary 424 logically<br>
separates at least two networks. In one embodiment, the network boundary 424<br>
is a firewall.<br>
	In one embodiment, the file extension is the file type and the server<br>
determining the file type does so by extracting the file extension from the file. In<br>
another embodiment, a resource fork is the file type. After determining file type,<br>
the server determining the file type transmits the file type to the application<br>
server farm 414 for retrieval and presentation to the client node 402 (Step 454).<br>
	The application server 416 receives the file type from the access control<br>
server 406. (Step 456). In some embodiments, the application server 416<br>
identifies an application program associated with that file type. In other<br>
embodiments, the access control server 406 identifies an application program<br>
associated with that file type. In still other embodiments, a server other than the<br>
access control server 406 or the application server 416 identifies the application<br>
program associated with that file type.<br>
	In one embodiment, the server identifying the application program<br>
associated with the file type queries an application database 418 to retrieve an<br>
identifier for the application program. In some embodiments, the application<br>
database 418 is a registry file. In embodiments where either the application<br>
server 416 or a separate server identify the application type based on the file<br>
type, the identifying server then transmits to the access control server 406 the<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
identifier to the application program. In some embodiments, the identifying<br>
server transmits the identifier to the access control server 406 over a network<br>
connection.<br>
	In some embodiments, neither the access control server 406 nor a<br>
separate server need to transmit the file type to the application server 416 to<br>
determine the identifier of the associated application program. In one of these<br>
embodiments, the application server 416 transmits to the access control server<br>
406 a list of hosted application programs and the file types with which those<br>
application programs are associated. In these embodiments, the access control<br>
server 406 retrieves from the transmitted list the identifier for the application<br>
program associated with the file type.<br>
	When the access control server 406 receives the identifier of the<br>
application program, the access control server 406 creates and transmits to the<br>
client node 402 an executable file (Step 458). In some embodiments, the<br>
executable file contains the identifier of the application program. In some<br>
embodiments, the executable file contains the identifier of an application server<br>
in the application server farm 414 that will present the contents of the file to the<br>
client node 402. In some embodiments, the same application server 416 that<br>
identified the application program to use with the file type will present the<br>
contents of the file to the client node 402. In other embodiments, a second<br>
application server 420 presents the contents of the file to the client node 402. In<br>
one embodiment, the executable file contains both the identifier of the<br>
application program and the identifier of an application server in the application<br>
server farm 414 what will present the contents of the file to the client node 402.<br>
In some embodiments, the executable file enables the client node 402 to<br>
connect with an identified server using a presentation-layer protocol such as the<br>
Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol, available from Citrix<br>
Systems, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In other embodiments, the executable<br>
file enables the client node 402 to connect with an identified server using the<br>
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), manufactured by Microsoft Corporation. In<br>
other embodiments, the presentation-layer protocol is wrapped in a higher<br>
protocol.<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
	The client node 402 receives the executable file from the access control<br>
server 406. The client node 402 connects to the application server 416<br>
identified in the executable file (Step 460). In one embodiment, the client node<br>
402 connects to the identified application server 416 using the ICA protocol. In<br>
another embodiment, the client node 402 connects to the identified application<br>
server 416 using RDP.<br>
	The application server 416 selects a format for the presentation of the file<br>
contents (Step 462). In other embodiments, the access control server 406<br>
identifies the format used to present the file contents. In those embodiments,<br>
the access control server 406 may apply a policy to identify the available<br>
formats. In some embodiments, the application server 416 selects the format<br>
based upon received information about the client node 402. In other<br>
embodiments, the application server 416 selects the format by applying a policy<br>
to the received information.<br>
	The application server 416 accepts the client node 402 connection and<br>
retrieves the requested file (Step 464). In one embodiment, the application<br>
server 416 retrieves the file from a web server. In another embodiment, the<br>
application server 416 retrieves the file from a file server. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the retrieved file is an email attachment. In this embodiment, the<br>
application server 416 retrieves the file from an electronic mail server. In some<br>
embodiments, the mail server is a Lotus mail server. In other embodiments, the<br>
mail server is an Outlook mail server or an Outlook Web Access mail server.<br>
	The application server 416 then presents the contents of the file to the<br>
client node 402 over the connection (Step 468). In one embodiment, the file<br>
contents presented comprise an email attachment.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 5, one embodiment of a computer network 500<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention is depicted, which includes a client<br>
node 502, a collection agent 504, a policy engine 506, a first component 508, a<br>
second component 512, a condition database 510, a policy database 512, a<br>
transformation server 516, and a storage element 518. In brief overview, when<br>
the client node 502 transmits a request 522 for access to a resource from the<br>
policy engine 506, the collection agent 504 communicates with client node 502,<br>
retrieving information about the client node 502, and transmitting client node<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
information 512 to the policy engine 506. The policy engine 506 makes an<br>
access control decision as discussed in FIG. 3 above. Once the policy engine<br>
506 decides to grant the client node 502 access to the requested file, the policy<br>
engine 506 transmits the request to the transformation server 516 for<br>
transformation and presentation to the client node 502.<br>
	In more detail, the policy engine 506 receives a request from the client<br>
node 502 for the transformed contents of a file. In one embodiment, the policy<br>
engine 506 identifies a transformation server 516 capable of presenting the<br>
transformed contents of the file to the client node 502. In some embodiments,<br>
the transformation server 516 is capable of presenting the transformed contents<br>
of the file because it contains a copy of previously transformed contents. In<br>
other embodiments, the transformation server 516 is capable of presenting the<br>
transformed contents of the file because it has the capacity to transform the file<br>
contents presently.<br>
	In one embodiment, the policy engine 506 identifies a transformation<br>
server 516 by querying a storage element 518 to determine whether a<br>
transformation server 516 previously transformed the contents of the file. In that<br>
embodiment, the policy engine 506 transmits the identifier of the transformation<br>
server 518 identified by the storage element 518 to the client node 502. In other<br>
embodiments, no transformation server 516 has previously transformed the<br>
contents. In those embodiments, the policy engine identifies instead a<br>
transformation server 516 capable of presently transforming the contents of the<br>
file and transmits the request of the client node 502 to that transformation server<br>
516.<br>
	In other embodiments, a server other than the policy engine 506 identifies<br>
the transformation server 516 capable of presenting the transformed contents of<br>
the file to the client. In some of those embodiments, that same server also<br>
transmits to the transformation server 516 the request for presentation of the file<br>
to the client. In some of these embodiments, the same server identifying the<br>
capable transformation server 516 routes transmits the request to the<br>
transformation server 516 through a proxy server.<br>
	In one embodiment, the transformation server 516 receives the request<br>
from the policy engine 506 for transformation of the contents of a requested file<br>

and presentation to the client node 502. In another embodiment, the<br>
transformation server 516 receives the request from the server other than the<br>
policy engine 506. The transformation server 516 retrieves the file and<br>
transforms the contents from a native format to a second format. The<br>
transformation server 516 then accepts a connection from the client node 502<br>
and presents the transformed contents of the file, transforming the contents if<br>
not previously transformed. Finally, the transformation server 516 writes to the<br>
storage element 518 the identifier of the server transforming the contents of the<br>
file and the identifier of the file.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 6, a flow diagram depicts one embodiment of the<br>
steps taken by the transformation server 516 to transform the content of the<br>
requested file and present the transformed contents to the client node 502.<br>
	The transformation server 516 receives the request for transformation of<br>
the contents of a requested file and presentation to the client node 502 (Step<br>
600). In one embodiment, the transformation server 516 receives this request<br>
over a network connection.<br>
	The transformation server 516 transforms the contents of the requested<br>
file from a native format into a second format (Step 602). In one embodiment,<br>
the transformation server 516 transforms the contents of the file using regular<br>
expressions, from a native format into a second format for presentation on the<br>
client. In another embodiment, the transformation server 516 transforms the<br>
contents of the file into a second format from a native format, which contains a<br>
format conversion tool. In another embodiment, the transformation server 516<br>
transforms the contents of the file from a native format into HTML. In another<br>
embodiment, the transformation server 516 transforms the contents of the file<br>
from a native format into a second format where the second format enables<br>
presentation on a personal digital assistant. In another embodiment, the<br>
transformation server 516 transforms the contents of the file from a native format<br>
into a second format, where the second format enables presentation on a<br>
cellular phone. In another embodiment, the transformation server 516<br>
transforms the contents of the file from a native format into a second format,<br>
where the second format enables presentation on a laptop computer. In another<br>
embodiment, the transformation server 516 transforms the contents of the file<br>
-21-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
from a native format into a second format, where the second format enables<br>
presentation at an Internet kiosk.<br>
	The transformation server 516 writes identifying information about the<br>
transformation to the storage element 518 (Step 604). In one embodiment, the<br>
identifying information includes an identifier for the transformation server 516<br>
and an identifier for the transformed file. In some embodiments, the identifying<br>
information includes a temporary file containing the transformed contents of the<br>
file. In those embodiments, the storage element 518 functions as a global cache<br>
of transformed file contents.<br>
	After the policy engine 506 identifies the transformation server 516<br>
capable of presenting the transformed contents of the file for the client node<br>
502, the policy server 506 transmits the identifier of the transformation server<br>
516 to the client node 502. The client node 502 receives the identifier and<br>
connects to the transformation server 516. The transformation server 516<br>
accepts the connection and presents the transformed contents of the requested<br>
file to the client node 502 over the connection (Step 606). In one embodiment,<br>
the transformation server 516 retains the transformed contents of the requested<br>
file after the presentation to the client node 502.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 7, one embodiment of a computer network 700<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention is depicted, which includes a first<br>
client node 702, a collection agent 704, an policy engine 706, a policy database<br>
708, a condition database 710, a second client node 716, a session server 720,<br>
a stored application database 722, an application server farm 724, a first<br>
application server 726, a first database 728, a second application server 730,<br>
and a second database 732. In brief overview, when the first client node 702<br>
transmits to the access control server 706 a request 712 for access to a<br>
resource, the collection agent 704 communicates with client node 702, retrieving<br>
information about client node 702, and transmitting client node information 714<br>
to the policy engine 706. The policy engine 706 makes an access control<br>
decision, as discussed above in FIG. 3. Finally, the session server 720<br>
establishes a connection between the client node 702 and a plurality of<br>
application sessions associated with the client node 702. Additional<br>
-22-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
components of the computer network 700 are omitted and will be described<br>
further in FIG. 7B.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 7B, a flow diagram depicts one embodiment of the<br>
steps taken by the session server 720 to connect the client node 702 with its<br>
associated application sessions. The session server 720 receives information<br>
about the client node 702 from the policy engine 706 containing access control<br>
decision the policy engine 706 made. In one embodiment, the information also<br>
includes the client node information 714.<br>
	In some embodiments, the policy engine 706 identifies a plurality of<br>
application sessions already associated with the client node 702. In other<br>
embodiments, the session server 720 identifies stored application sessions<br>
associated with the client node 702. In some of these embodiments, the<br>
session server 720 automatically identifies the stored application sessions upon<br>
receiving the information from the policy engine 706. In one embodiment, the<br>
stored application database 722 resides on the session server 720. In another<br>
embodiment, the stored application database 722 resides on the policy engine<br>
706.<br>
	The stored application database 722 contains data associated with a<br>
plurality of servers in the application server farm 724 executing application<br>
sessions. In some embodiments, identifying the application sessions associated<br>
with the client node 702 requires consulting stored data associated with one or<br>
more servers executing application sessions. In some of these embodiments,<br>
the session store 720 consults the stored data associated with one or more<br>
servers executing application sessions. In others of these embodiments, the<br>
policy engine 706 consults the stored data associated with one or more servers<br>
executing application sessions. In some embodiments, a first application<br>
session runs on a first application server 726 and a second application session<br>
runs on a second application server 730. In other embodiments, all application<br>
sessions run on a single application server within the application server farm<br>
724.<br>
	The session server 720 includes information related to application<br>
sessions initiated by users. The session server can be stored in volatile or non-<br>
-23-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
volatile memory or, for example, distributed through multiple servers. Table 7-1<br>
shows the data included in a portion of an illustrative session server 720.<br>
	Table 7-1<br>
ApplicationSession	App Session 1	App Session 2	App Session 3<br>
User ID	User 1	User 2	User 1<br>
Client ID	First Client		First Client<br>
Client Address	172.16.0.50		172.16.0.50<br>
Status	Active	Disconnected	Active<br>
Applications	Word Processor	Data Base	Spreadsheet<br>
Process Number	1	3	2<br>
Server	Server A	Server A	Server B<br>
Server Address	172.16.2.55	172.16.2.55	172.16.2.56<br>
	The illustrative session server 720 in Table 7-1 includes data associating<br>
each application session with the user that initiated the application session, an<br>
identification of the client computer 702 or 716, if any, from which the user is<br>
currently connected to the server 726, and the IP address of that client comp liter<br>
702a or 716. The illustrative session server 720 also includes the status of each<br>
application session. An application session status can be, for example, "active"<br>
(meaning a user is connected to the application session), or "disconnected"<br>
(meaning a user is not connected to the application session). In an alternative<br>
embodiment, an application session status can also be set to "executing-<br>
disconnected" (meaning the user has disconnected from the application session,<br>
but the applications in the application session are still executing), or "stalled-<br>
disconnected" (meaning the user is disconnected and the applications in the<br>
application session are not executing, but their operational state immediately-<br>
prior to the disconnection has been stored). The session server 720 further<br>
stores information indicating the applications 116 that are executing within each<br>
application session and data indicating each application's process on the server.<br>
In embodiments in which the server 726 is part of a server farm 724, the session<br>
server 720 is at least a part of the dynamic store, and also includes the data in<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
the last two rows of Table 1 that indicate on which server in the server farm each<br>
application is/was executing, and the IP address of that server. In alternative<br>
embodiments, the session server 720 includes a status indicator for each<br>
application in each application session.<br>
	For example, in the example of Table 7-1, three application sessions<br>
exist, App Session 1, App Session 2, and App Session 3. App Session 1 is<br>
associated with User 1, who is currently using terminal 1. Terminal one's IP<br>
address is 152.16.2.50. The status of App Session 1 is active, and in App<br>
Session 1, a word processing program, is being executed. The word processing<br>
program is executing on Server A as process number 1. Server A's IP address<br>
is 152.16.2.55. App Session 2 in Table 1 is an example of a disconnected<br>
application session 118. App Session 2 is associated with User 2, but App<br>
Session 2 is not connected to a client computer 702a or 716. App Session 2<br>
includes a database program that is executing on Server A, at IP address<br>
152.16.2.55 as process number 3. App Session 3 is an example of how a user<br>
can interact with application sessions operating on different servers 726. App<br>
Session 3 is associated with User 1, as is App Session 1. App Session 3<br>
includes a spreadsheet program that is executing on Server B at IP address<br>
152.16.2.56 as process number 2, whereas the application session included in<br>
App Session 1 is executing on Server A.<br>
	In one embodiment, the session server 720 is configured to receive a<br>
disconnect request to disconnect the application sessions associated with the<br>
client node 702 and does so disconnect the application sessions in response to<br>
the request. The session server 720 continues to execute an application<br>
session after disconnecting the client node 702 from the application session. In<br>
this embodiment, the session server 720 accesses the stored application<br>
database 722 and updates a data record associated with each disconnected<br>
application session so that the record indicates that the application session<br>
associated with the client node 702 is disconnected.<br>
	Unintentional termination of application sessions resulting from imperfect<br>
network connections and users' failure to terminate their application sessions<br>
themselves can lead to user difficulties. One embodiment of the invention limits<br>
these difficulties by differentiating disconnection (which is treated as if the user<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
is not done working with an application session) from termination (which is<br>
assumed to be an intentional end to the application session) and by correlating<br>
application sessions with users as opposed to client nodes. When a user is<br>
finished using an application operating in an application session, the user can<br>
terminate an application session. Termination generally involves the affirmative<br>
Input of the user indicating that the server should no longer maintain the<br>
application session. Such affirmative user input can include selecting an "Exit"<br>
option from a menu, clicking on an icon, etc. in response to the session server<br>
720 receiving a termination request, the execution of the application session and<br>
any application within that application session is halted. In one embodiment,<br>
data related to the application session is also removed from the stored<br>
application database 722.<br>
	Disconnection, either intentional or unintentional, on the other hand, does<br>
not result in termination of application sessions. Since the application or<br>
applications operating in an application session are executing on the server 720,<br>
a connection to the first client node 702 is not usually necessary to continue<br>
execution of the applications, and in one embodiment the applications can<br>
continue to execute while waiting for the user to connect. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, upon disconnection of a user, the session server 720 stalls the<br>
execution of the applications operating in the application session. That is, the<br>
session server 720 halts further execution of the applications, and the session<br>
server 720 stores the operational state of the application and any data the<br>
application is processing. In a further embodiment, the session server 720 can<br>
selectively stall execution of specific applications after a user disconnects. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, the session server 720 continues execution of an<br>
application for a fixed time period, and if a user fails to connect within that time<br>
period, the session server 720 stalls the application. In another embodiment,<br>
the session server 720 stalls specified application sessions that cannot continue<br>
executing without user input. In each of the above-described embodiments, if<br>
the user of the first client node 702 disconnects from the server 726 and then<br>
connects to the server 726 while operating the first client node 702, the second<br>
client node 716, or a third client computer, the session server 720 can connect<br>
the client computer operated by the user to one or more previously initiated,<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
non-terminated application session(s) associated with the user, and reinitiate<br>
execution of any stalled applications.<br>
	In one embodiment, the session server 720 detects a disconnection. A<br>
user can intentionally and manually instruct the server to disconnect an<br>
application session from the client node 702 or 716 from which the user is<br>
communicating. For example, in one embodiment, application sessions provide<br>
a menu option for disconnection (as distinguished from termination above) that a<br>
user can select. The session server 720 can also detect an unintentional<br>
disconnection. For example, in one embodiment, session server 720 identifies<br>
when a predetermined number of data packets transmitted to a client node 702<br>
or 716 have not been acknowledged by the client node 702 or 716. In another<br>
embodiment, the client node 702 or 716 periodically transmits a signal to the<br>
server 726 to confirm that a connection is still intact. If the session server 720<br>
detects that a predetermined number of expected confirmation signals from a<br>
client node 702 or 716 have not arrived, session server 720 determines that the<br>
client node 702 or 716 has disconnected. If the session server 720 detects that<br>
a user has disconnected from an application session, either intentionally, or<br>
unintentionally, the entry in the session server 720 related to the disconnected<br>
application session is modified to reflect the disconnection.<br>
	After receiving authentication information, the session server 720<br>
consults the stored applications database 722 to identify any active application<br>
sessions that are associated with the user, but that are connected to a different<br>
client node, such as the first client node 702, for example. In one embodiment,<br>
if the session server 720 identifies any such active application sessions, the<br>
session server 720 automatically disconnects the application session(s) from the<br>
first client node 702 and connects the application session(s) to the current client<br>
computer 716. In some embodiments, the received authentication information<br>
will restrict the application sessions to which the client node 702 may reconnect.<br>
In one embodiment, the user can trigger the automatic consultation of the<br>
session server and subsequent connection with the selection of a single user<br>
interface element.<br>
	After identifying the application sessions associated with the client node<br>
702, the session server 720 connects the client node 702 to associated<br>
-27-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
application sessions. The session server 720 determines whether each<br>
application session in the plurality is active or disconnected. In one<br>
embodiment, at least one application session in the plurality is active. In one<br>
embodiment, at least one application session in the plurality is disconnected. In<br>
one embodiment, the session server 720 receives the application output<br>
automatically. In another embodiment, receipt of the application output is<br>
triggered by client node 702 selection of a single user interface element. The<br>
session server 720 identifies disconnected application sessions to which to<br>
reconnect the client node 702 based upon the access control decision contained<br>
in the received information 714. In one embodiment, upon identifying any<br>
disconnected application sessions, the session server 720 prompts the user to<br>
indicate whether connection is desired. If connection is not desired, the session<br>
server 720 prompts user to indicate whether the disconnected applications<br>
sessions should remain disconnected, or whether the application sessions<br>
should be terminated.<br>
	In one embodiment, connection includes modifying the entry in the stored<br>
applications database 722 to indicate that the user is connected to the<br>
application session and to indicate from which client node 702 the user is<br>
connected to the server. Upon connection, the server 726 resumes transmitting<br>
application output data to the client node 702 or 716. In one embodiment, the<br>
plurality of application sessions associated with the client node was connected<br>
to the first client node 702 prior to connection and, after connection, the plurality<br>
of application sessions is reconnected to the first client node 702. In another<br>
embodiment, the plurality of application sessions associated with the client node<br>
was connected to the first client node 702 prior to connection and, after<br>
connection, the plurality of application sessions is reconnected to the second<br>
client node 716.<br>
	The following illustrative examples show how the methods and apparatus<br>
discussed above can be used to provide policy-based access to file contents for<br>
a client node. These examples are meant to illustrate and not to limit the<br>
invention.<br>

WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
	Evidence Collection<br>
	In one embodiment, a client node 102 requests access to a word<br>
processing document located on a server residing on the same network as the<br>
policy engine 106 resides. The policy engine 106 receives the request and<br>
determines that it possesses no information about client node 102. The policy<br>
engine 106 transmits a collection agent 104 to the client node 102. In some<br>
embodiments, the collection agent 104 has pre-defined information to collect<br>
from the client node. In other embodiments, the collection agent 104 first<br>
analyzes the client node to determine what type of information to collect. In still<br>
other embodiments, the collection agent 104 retrieves from the policy engine<br>
106 the instructions as to what information to collect about the client node 102.<br>
	Once executing on the client node 102, the collection agent 104 gathers<br>
the required information and transmits the information 112 to the policy engine<br>
106. The policy engine 106 receives the information 112 and begins the<br>
process of determining what conditions the information 112 satisfies. In some<br>
embodiments, the policy engine 106 determines that the received information<br>
112 does not suffice to determine whether the information 112 satisfies one or<br>
more conditions. In those embodiments, the policy engine 106 transmits further<br>
instructions to the collection agent 104 for gathering more information about the<br>
client node 102.<br>
	Policy-Based Access Control<br>
	As the first component 202 of the policy engine 106 determines that one<br>
or more conditions are satisfied, it stores an identifier for each satisfied condition<br>
in a data set. Upon completion, the first component 202 transmits the data set<br>
and the requested application to the second component 210. in an example of<br>
this embodiment, the requested application may be a word processing<br>
document and the conditions satisfied may indicate that the client device is a<br>
personal digital assistant. In another example of this embodiment, the<br>
requested application may be a spreadsheet and the conditions satisfied may<br>
indicate that the client device is a trusted laptop connecting from an insecure<br>
network such as a public internet kiosk. In a third example of this embodiment,<br>
the requested application may be a file attached to an electronic mail message<br>
and the conditions satisfied may indicate that the client device is on a personal<br>
-29-<br><br>
WO 2006/038985	 PCT/US2005/028605<br>
desktop connecting from a secure network but lacking the appropriate<br>
application software to view the file.<br>
	The second component 210 receives the data set from the first<br>
component 202 and applies one or more policies to the received data. In one<br>
example of this embodiment, the second component 210 may apply a policy<br>
requiring that when a client device type is a personal digital assistant if the<br>
condition that the client node have on it application software is not satisfied, the<br>
client node receive the transformed contents of the file. The client node would<br>
then receive an executable file enabling connection to a transformation server,<br>
which will present the contents of the file in a format accessible to the client<br>
device type. Applying this policy enables the client node to view the contents of<br>
the file in spite of inappropriate form factor for viewing<br>
	In another example of this embodiment, the second component 210 may<br>
apply a policy prohibiting download to the client node 102 when a client device<br>
type is a trusted laptop, containing the appropriate application software, but from<br>
an insecure network such as an Internet kiosk. In this embodiment, the policy<br>
might require that the policy engine 106 transmit an executable file to the client<br>
node 102 enabling connection to an application server 416 for presentation of<br>
the file contents. Applying a policy of this type, and retrieving the file only to the<br>
application server 416, enables the client node 102 to view the contents of the<br>
file without jeopardizing the proprietary contents of the file from inappropriate<br>
dissemination.<br>
	In yet another example of this embodiment, the second component 210<br>
may apply a policy requiring that a personal desktop making a secure<br>
connection, but lacking appropriate application software, connect to an<br>
application server 416 via an ICA session, and that the application server 416<br>
execute the appropriate application and present the file to the client node 102.<br>
Applying the policy enables the client node 102 to view the contents of the file<br>
regardless of the lack of application software on the client node 102.<br>
