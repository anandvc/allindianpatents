The present invention relates to a novel camptothecin derivative having enhanced antitumor activities, and intermediates therefor.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel camptothecin derivative w/hich is prepared by combining an aminoaikoxy- or hydroxyalkoxy-camptothecin compound with a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups via an amino acid or a peptide, intermediates therefor, and a process for preparing the same. The camptothecin derivative of the present invention can be delivered into a target region of the patient selectively and in much amount, so that they can show desired pharmacological activities at the desired region of the patient. Thus, the antitumor activities of the camptothecin compounds are enormously enhanced and their side effects can be reduced, and hence, these compounds are extremely useful as a medicament. Prior Art<br>
Camptothecin is one of plant alkaloids, and has the following formula:<br><br>
and it has been known to show antileukemic and antitumor activities, and one of campthothecin derivatives, irinothecan hydrochloride {CPT-11, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin], has already been put on the market.  However, CPT-11 shows potent antitumor activities In clinical<br><br>
use but also shows severe toxicity like other antitumor agents, so that CPT-11 has been restricted in its therapeutic use [of. Cancer and Chemotherapy, vol. 21, p. 709(1994)].<br>
On the other hand, in order to enhance the antitumor activity and also to reduce the side effects thereof as low as possible, these compounds having such severe side effects have been studied as to a kind of drug delivery system therefor, by which a necessary amount of a drug Is selectively delivered into a target tissue. Especially, In the chemotherapy of cancers, it is a serious problem that there is no significant difference between tumor cells and normal cells in sensitivity against anticancer agents, and many studies on targeting-type drug delivery system for anticancer agents have been done in order to selectively deliver an anticancer agent into a cancer-bearing region, for example, doxorubicin-polysaccharide complex (WO 94/19376), doxorubicin-inclusive liposome (Enhancemer\t of effects of anticancer agents and targeting therapy, p. 227 (1987), published by Science Forum Ltd-), dextran-binding mitomycin (Enhancement of effects of anticancer agents and targeting therapy, p. 278 (1987), published by Science Forum Ltd.).<br>
As explained above, camptothecin compounds show excellent anti¬tumor activities and are very useful as a medicament but they are strictly restricted in clinical use because of their severe side effects. Thus, it is desired to develop a new camptothecin derivative wherein the excellent pharmacological activities are duly retained but undesirable severe side effects are suppressed.<br>
Under the above mentioned circumstances, the present inventors have intensively studied in order to obtain an excellent camptothecin derivative<br><br>
without the drawback of the conventional camptothecin compounds by utilizing the techniques of the above mentioned drug delivery system, and finally have found that a novel camptothecin derivative having desired pharmacological effects can be obtained by combining a camptothecin compound having a reactive group with a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups via an amino acid or a peptide, and have accomplished the present invention. Brief Description of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel camptothecin derivative comprising the camptothecin compound [I] bound to a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups via an amino acid or a peptide.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel intermediate which is selected from the camptothecin compound [I] and a camptothecin compound comprising the camptothecin compound [I] bound to an amino acid or a peptide.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing these camptothecin derivative and intermediates therefor. Detailed Description Qf Invention<br>
The compound of the present invention is a comptothecin derivative comprising a camptothecin compound having an aminoalkoxy group or a hydroxyalkoxy group, represented by the formula [I];<br><br><br>
wherein R^ is a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, X^ is a group of the formula: -NHR2 (R2 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group) or a group of the formula: -OH, and Alk is a straight chain or branched chain alkylene group having optionally an oxygen atom In the chain thereof, bound to a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups via an amino acid or a peptide.<br>
According to the studies by the present inventors, it has been found that the novel camptothecin compound of the above formula [I] and a compound which is prepared by combining the compound [I] with an amino acid or a peptide are both very useful as an intermediate for the desired camptothecin derivative of the present invention, and also that they per se have an excellent anti-tumor activity.<br>
The camptothecin derivative of the present invention includes compounds which are prepared by combining the camptothecin compound [I] with a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups via an amino acid or a peptide, for example, ones which are prepared by combining a part or all of the carboxyl groups of an amino acid or a peptide with X^ of the compound [I] through acid-amide or ester bonds, followed by combining a part or all of the carboxyl groups of a polysaccharide with an amino group of said amino acid or said peptide through acid-amide bonds.  More particularly, the camptothecin derivative of the present invention includes compounds which are prepared by combining the C-terminal carboxyl group of an amino acid or<br><br>
a peptide with Xi of the compound [I] through acid-amide or ester bonds, followed by combining a part or all of the carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide with the N-terminal amino group of said amino acid or said peptide through acid-amide bonds.<br>
Each substituent of the compound of the formula [I] of the present invention is explained below.<br>
The lower alkyl group for R"" and R2 when X^ is a group of the formula: -NHR2 includes alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, etc.   The substituent of the lower alkyl group for R^ includes, for example, a protected or unprotected hydroxy, mercapto and amino group, and these groups may optionally be protected by an alkyl group or an acyl group, etc.<br>
The straight chain or branched chain alkylene group having optionally an oxygen atom in the chain thereof for AIR includes a straight chain or branched chain alkylene group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example, methylene, ethylene, trimethylene, propylene, tetramethylene, penta-methylene, hexamethylene, 1-methyiethylene, 1-methylpropylene, 2-methyl-propylene, etc., and a straight chain or branched chain alkylene group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having one or more oxygen atoms in the chain thereof, such as -CHaCHa-O-CHsCHg-, -CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2-, -CHgCHCCHal-O-CHaCHa-, -CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2- etc.<br>
Among the compounds [I] of the present invention, the compound of the formula [I] wherein X^ is a group of the formula:-NHR2, i.e. a compound of the formula [!']:<br><br><br>
wherein R\ R2 and Alk are the same as defined above, is preferable, and more particularly, among the compounds [I], the compound of the formula [I'] wherein R"" is an unsubstituted lower alkyl group, R2 is a hydrogen atom, Alk is a straight chain or branched chain alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms having no oxygen atom in the chain thereof is more preferable.<br>
Among the compounds [I], the compound of the formula [I] wherein Ri is ethyl group, and Xi-Alk-0- is 3-aminopropyloxy group which is bonded at the 10-position of the camptothecin nucleus, is most preferable.<br>
The polysaccharide having carboxyl groups includes the same as those as disclosed in the above mentioned WO 94/19376, and includes polysaccharides having originally carboxyl groups in the structure thereof {e.g. hyaluronic acid, pectic acid, alginic acid, chondroitin, heparin, etc.), and polysaccharide having originally no carboxyl group {e.g. pullulan, dextran, mannan, chitin, mannoglucan, chitosan, etc.) but being introduced thereto carboxyl groups. Among these polysaccharides, dextran is especially preferable, particularly dextran having an average molecular weight of 20,000 to 400,000 is more preferable, and particularly dextran having an average molecular weight of 50,000 to 150,000 is most preferable (said average molecular weight being determined by Gel permeation chromatography method, Shinseikagaku Jikken Koza, vol. 20, p. 7). The polysaccharides having originally no carboxyl group but being introduced thereto carboxyl<br><br>
groups mean ones which are prepared by substituting a part or all of hydrogen atoms of hydroxy groups of polysaccharides having originally no carboxyl group with a carboxy-Ci.4 alkyl group.<br>
The "polysaccharide having carboxyl groups" of the present invention also includes ones which are prepared by treating a polysaccharide originally having no carboxyl group with a reducing agent, and then followed by substituting the hydrogen atoms of a part or all of hydroxyl groups of the product with a carboxy-Ci.4 alkyl group.<br>
The alkyl moiety of the carboxy-Ci.4 alkyl group may be either a straight chain alkyl group or a branched chain alkyl group.  Preferable carboxy-Ci.4 alkyl group is, for example, carboxymethyl group, 1-carboxyethyl group, 3-carboxypropyl group, 1-niethyl-3-carboxypropyl group, 2-methyl-3-carboxy-propyl group, 4-carboxybutyl group, etc., and carboxymethyl group and 1-carboxyethyl group are more preferable.  In the present invention, the polysaccharide having carboxyl groups is preferably a carboxymethylated dextran or pullulan.<br>
When introducing a carboxyalkyi group into polysaccharides, the degree of the introduction thereto is expressed by "degree of substitution" which is defined by a number of carboxyalkyi groups per a sugar residue, i.e. expressed by the following equation.<br>
Number of carboxyalkyi groups in the molecule<br>
Degree of Substitution = ,	<br>
Total number of sugar residues in the molecule When the carboxyalkyi group is carboxymethyl group, the degree 0I substitution is occasionally expressed by the degree of carboxymethylation (CM-degree).<br><br>
When the polysaccharide is pullulan, dextran or mannoglucan, and all of the hydroxy groups thereof are substituted, the degree of substitution thereof is 3, and preferable degree of substitution is in the range of 0.3 to 0.8.<br>
When the polysaccharide is chltin, and all of the hydroxy groups thereof are substituted, the degree of substitution thereof is 2, and preferable degree of substitution is in the range of 0.3 to 0.8.<br>
Besides, it is essential that the polysaccharide of the present Invention should have at least one carboxyalkyl group In the molecule except for polysaccharides having originally carboxyl groups.  Thus, polysaccharides with the degree of substitution of 0 should be excluded from the polysaccharide of the present invention.<br>
The polysaccharide having carboxyl groups may be prepared Dy the method disclosed in WO 94/19376.<br>
The amino acid which intervenes between a camptothecin confipound [I] and a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups includes both natural amino adds and synthetic amino acids (including D-amino acid, L-amIno acid, a mixture thereof), and also Includes either neutral amino acids, basic amino acids or acidic amino acids.  Moreover, the amino acid of the present invention may be not only a-amino acids but also p-amino acids, y-amino acids, e-amino acids, etc., and includes, for example, glycine, a-alanine, p-alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan, proline, hydroxyproline, y-amlnobutyric add, e-aminocaproic acid, etc.<br>
The peptide of the present invention includes peptides derived from the<br><br>
above amino acids, or peptides having compounds other than amino acids in the part of the chain thereof. For example, a dicarboxylic acid such as succinic acid, a diamine such as ethylenediamine, or a diol such as ethyleneglycol may exist in the middle of the peptide chain or the terminus of the peptide chain. Besides, the binding site of the peptide chain to the carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide usually starts from the N-terminus of the peptide chain through acid-amide bonds. When a basic amino acid {e.g. lysin) exists in the peptide chain, the binding site of the peptide chain may be reversed by binding the e-amino group of basic amino acid with carboxyl groups of a polysaccharide, and binding an a-amino group with the C-terminus of the peptide chain.<br>
Such peptides may be ones composed of more than one amino acid, i.e. ones having more than one amino acid, more preferably ones having 2 to 5 peptide chains. Suitable examples of peptide chain are -Gly-Gly-L- or D-Phe-Gly-, -L or D-Phe-Gly-, -L or D-Tyr-Gly-, -L or D-Leu-Gly-, -Gly-Giy-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly- or-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly~Gly-and peptide chains containing these sequences (the N-terminus of the these peptides or peptide chains containing these sequences is introduced onto the carboxyl groups of a polysaccharide). Among these peptides, -Gly-Gly-L or D-Phe-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-, -L or D-Phe-Gly- and -L or D-Leu-Gly- are more preferable.<br>
Among them, -Gly-Gly-L-Phe-Gly, -Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-, -L or D-Phe-Gly- are most preferable.<br>
The camptothecin derivatives of the present invention may usually be prepared by combining the compound [I] with an amino acid or a peptide,<br><br>
followed by reacting the product with a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups.<br>
When X^ of the formula [I] is a group of the formula: -NHR^, the compound [I] is combined with the C-terminal carboxyl group of an amino acid or a peptide through acid-amide bonds. When X^ of the formula [I] is a group of the formula: -OH, the compound [I] is combined with the C-terminal carboxyl group of an amino acid or a peptide through ester bonds. In this case, it is preferable to protect other functional groups of the amino acid or the peptide which do not participate in said acid-amide bonds or ester bonds, for example, the N-terminal amino group or other carboxyl groups are protected in a conventional manner, prior to the reaction of the compound [I] and an amino acid or a peptide. The protecting group may be any protecting groups which are conventionally used for protection of amino acids, and the protecting group of amino group is, for example, t-butoxycarbonyl group, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl group, etc., and the protecting group of carboxyl group is, for example, a lower all<yl group t-butyl benzyl etc.></yl>
The production of the above mentioned acid-amide bonds or ester bonds between Xi of the compound [I] and an amino acid or a peptide is carried out by a conventional method, for example, by reacting in the presence of a condensing agent in a suitable solvent. The solvent includes, for example, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, chloroform, methylene chloride, etc., and the condensing agent includes, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, etc.<br>

with an amino acid or a peptide, after removing protecting groups of amino group therefrom when amino group thereof is protected, is reacted with a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups, to give the desired camptothecin derivatives of the present invention.  In this reaction, a part or all of the carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide are combined with the N-terminal amino group of the amino acid or that of the peptide which is previously bonded to the camptothecin compound [I], through acid-amide bonds.<br>
The reaction of the camptothecin compound which is produced by combining the compound [I] with an amino acid or a peptide, and a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups is carried out by a conventional method, for example, in the presence of a condensing agent in a suitable solvent. The solvent includes, for example, water, ethanol, dlmethyl-formamide, or a mixture thereof, and the condensing agent includes, for example, 1-{3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 2-ethyloxy-1 -ethyloxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, etc.<br>
In the camptothecin derivatives of the present invention, the ratio of the polysaccharide and the camptothecin compound [I] which is an active ingredient may be selected according to the kinds of the polysaccharide to be used, but the content of the camptothecin compound [I] in the camptothecin derivative is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 20 % by weight, more preferably In the range of 2 to 10 % by weight, when the polysaccharide is pullulan, dextran, chitin or mannoglucan.<br>

the range of 60,000 to 200,000, determined by the GPC analysis.<br>
The camptothecin derivatives of the present invention thus obtained may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if necessary. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes, for example, salts with an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal (e.g. sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium salt, etc.), or salts with an amino acid (e.g. arginine salt, lysine salt, etc.).<br>
The camptothecin compound of the formula [I] may be prepared by the following Reaction Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
wherein X^ is a protecting group-N(R2)- or a protecting group-O-, and R\ X^ and Alk are the same as defined above.<br>
Tliat is, the aminocarbonyl compound (1) is condensed with a known pyranoindolidine {2} (cf. EP-0220601-A) by a method known as Friedlander condensation reaction (cf. Organic Reactions, 28, pp. 37-202, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1982)), followed by removing the protecting groups from the product to give the desired camptothecin compound [I].<br>
In the above reaction scheme, R^ may be introduced after said Friedlander condensation reaction.<br><br>
Instead of the compound (1), a compound of the formula (1) wherein Ri is a hydrogen atom is condensed with the compound (2) by Friedlander condensation reaction, and the resulting condensed product Is subjected to radical reaction disclosed in Chem. Pharm. Bull., 22. 2574-2581 (1991) with a derivative of the formula: R^-CO-X (X is a hydrogen atom or a reactive group) to give the desired compound [I].<br>
Further, instead of the aminocarbonyl compound (1) in the above Reaction Scheme 1, when using a compound of the formula [II]:<br><br>
wherein X^ is R3-N{R2)- or R3-0-, R^ is a group which is prepared by removing a hydroxy group from the carboxyl group of an amino acid or peptide having a protected amino group, and R\ R^ and A.lk are the same as defined above, a camptothecin compound wherein the camptothecin compound [I] and an amino acid or a peptide are combined may be obtained.<br>
The starting aminocarbonyl compound (1) wherein X^ is a protecting group-N(R2)- may be prepared by the following Reaction Scheme 2.<br><br><br>
wherein R"" and Alk are the same as defined above, R3 is a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl or alkyl group, R'^ is a protected aminoalkyl group, Prot is a protecting group and T is a tosyl group or a mesyl group.<br>
A protecting group is introduced onto the aminoalkanol, H{R2)N-Alk-0H, to give a protected aminoalkanol (a), which is tosylated or mesylated to give a compound (b) wherein the hydroxy group is activated. On the other hand, a Grignard reagent (R^MgBr) is reacted with a hydroxy-substituted o-nitrobenzaldehyde, and the resulting compound (c) Is reacted with the previously prepared compound {b} to give a compound (d) wherein the phenolic hydroxy group Is alkylated. The compound (d) is treated with an oxidizing agent, for example, active manganese dioxide to give a ketone compound (e), followed by subjecting the compound (e) to catalytic reduction in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Pd-C to give a compound {1 ■&gt;).<br><br>
it   may be isolated from the reaction mixture but can be used in the condensation reaction with the compound (2) without purification or isolation.<br>
In the above Reaction Scheme 2, a protecting group of amino group in R^ of the ketone compound (e) is removed by a conventional manner, and the resulting product is reacted with an amino acid or a peptide having a protected amino group. The resulting product is subjected to catalytic reduction in the same manner as the reduction of the ketone compound (e) to give the aminocarbonyl compound (1) wherein the protecting group in X2 is replaced by a group which is prepared by removing a hydroxy group from the carboxyl group of an amino acid or peptide having a protected amino group.<br>
Among the starting aminocarbonyl compounds (1) in the above Reaction Scheme 1, the compound (1) wherein X2 is a protecting group-0~ is prepared by the following Reaction Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
wherein Alk, R^ and R3 are the same as defined above, R^ is a lower alkyl group, X^ is a halogen atom, R^ is a hydroxyalkyi group, and R' is a protected hydroxyalkyl group.<br>
The hydroxy-substituted o-nitrobenzaldehyde dialkyi acetal is reacted with hydroxyalkyl halide to have the phenolic hydroxy group hydroxyalkylated. The hydroxy group of said hydroxyalkyl group is protected, for example, by t-butyldimethylsilyl group, etc. and the acetal product thus obtained Is subjected to hydrolysis to give an aikoxy-substituted o-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative, which is reacted with a Grignard reagent in the same manner as in Reaction Scheme 2 to give a compound (d^). The compound (d^) is oxidized in the same manner as in Reaction Scheme 2, and the resulting compound (e^) is further subjected to catalytic reduction to give the compound (1^^).<br><br>
Besides, in the above Reaction Scheme 3, the protecting group of hydroxy group of the compound {e') is removed by a conventional method, and the product thus obtained is reacted and combined through an ester bond with an amino acid or a peptide having a protected amino group in the same manner as In the preparation of the compound [I], and then the resulting product is subjected to catalytic reduction in the same manner as in the reduction of the compound (e^) to give a compound [II].<br>
The camptothecin derivatives of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof show excellent antitumor activities against various tumors, especially they show excellent therapeutic effects on solid tumors such as pulmonary cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer (large bowel cancer, gastric cancer, etc.).<br>
The camptothecin derivatives of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are preferably administered parenteraily (e.g. intravascular injection), and are usually used in the form of a liquid preparation (e.g. solution, suspension, emulsion, etc.).<br>
The dosage of the desired compound of the present invention varies according to the administration method, ages, weights or conditions of the patients, but it is usually in the range of 0.02-50 mg/kg/day, more preferably in the range of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day, converted into the dose of the camptothecin compound [1] or the camptothecin compound [I] hydrochloride when X^ is a group of the formula: -NHR^.<br>
