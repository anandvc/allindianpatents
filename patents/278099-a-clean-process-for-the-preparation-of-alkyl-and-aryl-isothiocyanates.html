				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the synthesis of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates and more<br>
particularly an eco-friendly and energy efficient process to produce the same involving<br>
very simple and cost-effective process steps. More specifically the alkyl and aryl<br>
isothiocyanates with high purity and yield are obtained involving direct treatment of the<br>
alkyl and aryl dithiocarbamate salts with thiophilic halogen in the presence of base and in<br>
organic solvent or in a biphasic medium. The reagents are easily available and safe being<br>
non-corrosive, environmentally safe and inexpensive. The process is further directed to a<br>
simple and faster production of the alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates with no extraneous<br>
heating making it further energy efficient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Isothiocyanates are an important class of molecules in synthetic organic chemistry wherein<br>
they act as electrophiles with the carbon atom being the electrophilic center and are thus<br>
key intermediates for the preparation of both sulfur and nitrogen containing organic<br>
compounds especially for heterocycles including thiohydantoins, thioquinazolones,<br>
mercaptoimidazoles, thioamidazolones, pyridinethiones, pyrrolidine, benzothiazine etc. and<br>
are also used as synthons for dithiadiazafulvalenes.<br>
Isothiocyanates are also used in the synthesis of various agrochemicals that have<br>
antifungal and anathematic activities.<br>
Isothiocyanate functionality is frequently encountered in many natural products such as in<br>
cruciferous plants and vegetables. By virtue of cruciferous plants defense mechanism, the<br>
glucosinates that are present in these plants are converted into isothiocyanates by the<br>
action of plant myrosinase and gastrointestinal microflora on glucosinates. A number of<br>
isothiocyanates and a limited number of glucosinolates were examined and were found to<br>
effectively block chemical carcinogenesis in animal models.<br>
Several sesquiterpene isothiocyanates have been isolated from marine natural products.<br>
Additionally, synthetic isothiocyantes have been proved to have some biological activity,<br>
such as anti-proliferative and antitumourous. Amongst the synthetic isothiocyanates,<br>
phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and sulforaphane, have been shown .o inhibit<br>
carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis and as such are useful chemo preventive agents against<br>
the development and proliferation of cancer wherein they work on a variety of levels. Most<br>
notably, they have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis through inhibition of cytochrome<br>
P450 enzymes, which oxidize compounds such as benzopyrene and other polycyclic<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into more polar epoxy-diols which can then cause mutation<br>
and induce cancer development. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) has been shown to<br>
induce apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, and in some cases, is even able to induce<br>
apoptosis in cells that are resistant to some currently used chemotherapeutic crugs. For<br>
example, in drug resistant leukemia cells which produce the powerful apoptosis inhibitor<br>
protein BCI-2.<br>
The biological activity also extends to the use of synthetic isothiocyanates as enzyme<br>
inhibitors for the HIV virus. Reduced glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant defense is<br>
depleted in plasma and peripheral and blood mononuclear cells of patients infected with<br>
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The administration of low molecular weight<br>
thiols to raise GSH levels has been advocated as a method to treat HIV-1 infectec patients<br>
whereas another not much explored strategy to raise GSH levels is the use of<br>
anticarcinogenic enzyme inducing compounds like isothiocyanates, phenolic anti oxidants<br>
and the like.<br>
Amongst this class of molecules, phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) is used as a reagent in<br>
Edman peptide sequencing, wherein the amino terminus of a protein or a polypeptide is<br>
first derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) under basic conditions. Since PITC is a<br>
good electrophile a non-nucleophilic base like tertiary amine such as triethylamine (TEA)<br>
or diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) is used to facilitate the coupling step that produces a<br>
phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) peptide or protein. Under acidic conditions, the thiocarbonyl<br>
function of the PTC which is a moderately strong nucleophile, attacks the carbonyl carbon<br>
of the adjacent peptide bond and this nucleophilic attack or cleavage step results in the<br>
production of an anilothiazolinone (ATZ) of the terminal amino acid and leaves the original<br>
peptide or protein shortened by exactly one amino acid residue. The ATZ of terminal amino<br>
acid has different solubility properties from the peptide or protein, so it can be extracted<br>
and subjected to further analysis. The shortened peptide or protein again has a bare<br>
 <br>
amino terminus, so it can be subjected to additional cycles of coupling, cleavage, and<br>
extraction. The extracted ATZ of the terminal amino acid, however, is not stable. Under<br>
acidic aqueous conditions, ATZ's rearrange rapidly to form more stable<br>
phenylthiohydantoins (PTH's), which are more amenable to analysis. The stable PTH's are<br>
then analyzed by UV absorption detection reverse phase High Performance Liquid<br>
Chromatography (UV/HPLC).<br>
Similarly, synthetic isothiocyanates are also used for other biological assays of DI\IA and<br>
protein.<br>
Several methods exist in literature on the synthesis of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates.<br>
References are drawn to arts, Chem. Ber. 1982, 5, 799; J. Chem. Soc. 1924, 125 1702; J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 1932, 54, 777 and Chem. Rev. 1991, 91, 1 wherein isothiocyanates are<br>
prepared by reacting amines with thiophosgene under controlled condition using protic<br>
solvents like chloroform, toluene etc. The disadvantages of the procedure reside in the<br>
high toxicity of thiophosgene and its incompatibility with many functional groups.<br>
References are also drawn to Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2008, 6189; Tetrahedron Lett. 2008, 49,<br>
3117; J. Org. Chem. 2007, 72, 3969; Org. Preparation and Procedure Int. 2000, 32, 571;<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1997, 38, 8743; J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 4539; Indian J. chem. 1970,<br>
8, 759; German patent DE2105473 and Chem. Lett. 1977, 573, wherein isothiocyanates<br>
are synthesized using diacetoxyiodobenzene (DIB), di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate, tosyl<br>
chloride, CIC02Et, Claycop, hydrogen peroxide and 2-chloropyridinium salt mediated<br>
decomposition of the in situ generated dithiocarbamic acid salts. The required<br>
dithiocarbamic acid salts are generated in situ by treatment of an amine with carbon<br>
disulfide and a base (NaOH or triethylamine) in an organic solvent. The disadvantages of<br>
these procedures are longer reaction time, low yield of isothiocyanates, use of noisture<br>
sensitive lachrymatic and corrosive tosyl chloride and di-tert-butyl carbonate. The use of<br>
2-chloropyridinium salt gives l-methyl-2-pyridinethione as the by product. Other problems<br>
associated with the existing methods are requirement of high temperature and hign cost of<br>
most of the reagents.<br>
The procedure outlined in Synth. Commun. 1998, 28, 1223; Tetrahedron Lett. 2 004, 45,<br>
269 and Synthesis 1982, 596 leads to the desulfurylation of dithiocarbamates that are<br>
 <br>
carried out by various reagents such as uranium and phosphonium including<br>
triphenylphosphine dibromide. The drawbacks of the method are the high cost of the said<br>
reagent and the associated by products.<br>
Chem. Commun. 1997, 881 reveals a process involving the treatment of N-(arylimino)-<br>
1,2,3-dithiazole derivative with two equivalents of ethylmagnesium bromide giving<br>
corresponding aryl isothiocyanate and provides for a two step conversion of amine into<br>
isothiocyanate. Expensive starting materials and the use of sensitive and expensive<br>
Grignard reagent are the main set back of the method.<br>
Reference is drawn to Nippon Kagaku Kaishi 1998, 5, 822 and Chem. Express 1988, 3,<br>
215 wherein treatment of ammonium dithiocarbamates with PPh3-CCI4 is reported to give<br>
isothiocyanate. The reaction rates are known to be accelerated in polar solvents such as<br>
MeCN and the yield increases with increase in the concentration of the substrate and also<br>
the molar ratio PPh3-CCl4 but decreases with the rise in reaction temperature. Poor yields<br>
and isolation problems along with expensive reagents are the associated drawbacks of the<br>
methods.<br>
Synthesis 1989, 300 relates to a process where Wadsworth- Emmons reaction of<br>
(EtO)2P(0)NRNa (R = Ph, Bu, CH2Ph, cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl, CH2CHMe2) with CS2 in<br>
benzene containing Bu4NBr gave RNCS. Expensive reagent used is the main disadvantage<br>
of the method.<br>
Reference is again drawn to J. Chem. Res. 2005, 585 wherein isothiocyanates are<br>
prepared from amines via in situ generated dithiocarbamic acid salts using two phosgene<br>
equivalents	viz.	bis-(tricholoromethyl)	carbonate	(BTC )	and<br>
tricholoromethylchloroformates (TFC) in dichloromethane. The drawbacks of this process<br>
remain in the use of environmentally unsafe halogenated solvent, longer reaction times<br>
and the use of hazardous BTC and TFC.<br>
Reference yet again is drawn to J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 337; J. Org. Chem 1986, 51,<br>
2613, Tetrahedron Lett. 1985, 26, 1661; Chem. Commun. 1995, 1995 and Justus Liebigs<br>
Annalen der Chemie 1962, 657, 104, wherein, the reaction of amines with thiocarbonyl<br>
transfer reagents like thiocarbonylditriazole, thiocarbonyldiimidazole and di-1-pyridyl<br>
thionocarbonate (DPT) yields the corresponding isothiocyanates. Although these leagents<br>
 <br>
are found to be effective in the specific formation of isothiocyanate and occasionally as<br>
desulfurylating agent for thiourea, their scope is somehow limited and lead to extensive<br>
formation of the corresponding thiourea as byproduct. The disadvantages of this procedure<br>
are the additional preparation of thiocarbonyl transfer reagents and formation of its<br>
harmful byproduct along with the use of halo solvent.<br>
Bull. Chem. Soc. 1986, 7, 407 illustrates a process wherein isothiocyanate are prepared<br>
directly from amines using l,l'-(thiocarbonyldioxy)dibenzotriazole. This eagent is<br>
prepared by the reaction of siloxybenzotriazole with thiophosgene. High cost of the<br>
reagent is the main disadvantage of this method.<br>
Journal of Sulfur Chemistry, 2005, 26, 155 substantiates a process wherein a series of<br>
isothiocyanates were readily obtained from the corresponding isocyanates using<br>
Lawesson's reagent under microwave irradiation under solvent free condition. The obvious<br>
drawback is the high cost of the Lawesson's reagent.<br>
Reference is drawn to Zeitschrift fuer Chem. 1990, 30, 89 wherein the reaction of imide<br>
acid chlorides with sodium dithiocarbamates gave isothiocyanates and thiocarboxylic acid<br>
amides. Moisture sensitive and lachrymatic nature of the reagent are the drawbacks of the<br>
method.<br>
Synthesis 1982, 969, Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1977, 50, 425; Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. ; 975,. 48,<br>
2981 and Organic Synthesis 1956, 36, 56, relates to a process wherein isothiocyanates are<br>
obtained by base (NaOH, Grignard Reagent) catalyzed decomposition of thiourea in<br>
toluene. Preparation of thiourea and the strong basic condition are the drawbacks of the<br>
method.<br>
Reference is also made to J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1922, 44, 2896 wherein the isothiozyanates<br>
are prepared by acid (H2SO4) mediated decomposition of thiourea. A harsh reaction<br>
condition limits its efficacy for the preparation of isothiocyanates.<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1966, 5, 963 speaks about a reaction wherein ester<br>
bis(trichloromethyl) pentathiodiperoxy carbonate reacts with 3 equivalents of amines, in<br>
an aqueous suspension giving isothiocyanates. On reaction with two equivalents of amine<br>
the ester produces thiophosgene which subsequently reacts with a further equivalent of<br>
 <br>
amine giving isothiocyanates. The drawback of this process is the use of very expensive<br>
and toxic bis(trichloromethyl) pentathiodipeoxy carbonate.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1997, 38, 1597 exemplifies isothiocyanates that are synthesized from<br>
aldoximes. Aldoxime in DMF when treated with N-chlorosuccinimide or HCI/ Oxone system<br>
affords the corresponding hydroximoyl chlorides. To this a THF solution of thiourea (1<br>
equiv.) and triethylamine (1.1 equivalent) is added to obtain isothiocyanate. Longer<br>
reaction time, harsh reaction conditions and high expense of handling are the drawbacks<br>
of this process.<br>
Reference is made to Tetrahedron Lett. 1993, 34, 8283, wherein isothiocyanates are<br>
prepared in good yields from nitrile oxide and hydroximidoyl chloride with thiourea.<br>
Additional preparation of thiourea, expensive nitrile oxide and hydroximiuoy. chloride<br>
makes this method less attractive.<br>
Synthesis, 1991, 1001 talks about the amides being transformed into isothiocyanates by<br>
reaction of carbon disulfide in acetonitrile in the presence of anhydrous NaOH / K2CO3<br>
mixture. This method is low yielding and requires strongly basic condition.<br>
Reference is drawn to Tetrahedron Lett. 1991, 32, 3503 wherein isothiocyanates are<br>
synthesized in good yields from the corresponding isocyanides and elemental suliur under<br>
mild conditions using catalytic amount of elemental selenium. Metallic selenium is highly<br>
toxic, so is isocyanides and hence not a popular method.<br>
Chinese patent CN1880302 and Japanese patent no's: JP2002053547, JP11035550,<br>
JP10087605, JP03193760, JP06157454 and Chemische Berichte, 1965, 98, 1425, is<br>
directed to the synthesis of isothiocyanates from in situ generated dithiocarbamic acid<br>
salts by treating with dichlorodimethyl silane, acetic anhydride, dicyandiamide, 2-chloro-<br>
1,3-dimethylimidazolinium chloride and POCl3. The disadvantages of this procedure is that<br>
it results is stoichiometric amount of alkali and heavy metal salts as byproduct use of<br>
environmentally undesirable halo solvent, longer reaction time and poor yield.<br>
Japanese patent JP04297452 and JP04297451 is referred where isothiocyanates are<br>
prepared by isomerization of thiocyanates using alkylammonium bromide in the presence<br>
 <br>
of 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone at 140°C. This method is a multi step process and<br>
carried at a higher temperature giving lesser yield of the product.<br>
Reference is drawn to JP63033359, wherein isothiocyanates are prepared by treating<br>
amines with 2 equiv. of carbon disulfide, alkyl halide in presence of DBU in benzene at 80<br>
°C. The drawbacks with this process are requirement of high temperature, presence of<br>
human carcinogenic solvent benzene and high cost of production.<br>
Inspite of the huge number of teachings flowing from the background art, such above said<br>
processes for the synthesis of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates are summarized to suffer from<br>
either one or many of the drawbacks which include:<br>
a)	low yielding and thus less efficient;<br>
b)	strongly basic and harsh reaction conditions;<br>
c)	use of hazardous halo solvent ;<br>
d)	toxic and lachrymatic nature of the reagents;<br>
e)	moisture sensitive reagent and difficulty in handling;<br>
f)	formation of harmful by products;<br>
g)	longer reaction times and high reaction temperatures;<br>
e)	expensive nature of the reagents and low commercial availability;<br>
f)	isolation difficulties;<br>
In light of the above said there is a continuous need in the art to develop a process for the<br>
manufacture of alkyl and arylisothiocyanates in an industrial scale which would circumvent<br>
all the aforementioned difficulties associated with the process.<br>
More particularly, it would be clearly apparent from the discussion above that there is a<br>
strong need in the art to provide for a process for the manufacture oi alkyl and<br>
arylisothiocyanates in an industrial scale that would enable an efficient economic,<br>
environment friendly and importantly also be high yielding process with highly unity of<br>
product obtained by the process.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As already disclosed herein before the present invention comprises of a simple and cost-<br>
effective and environment friendly process for manufacture of alkyl and aryl<br>
isothiocyanates of the general formula R-NCS, wherein R is an alkyl and aryl group<br>
selected from the group of aliphatic and aromatic amines comprising of cyclohexyl. n-<br>
butyl, benzyl, phenyl, 4-bromo phenyl, 4-chloro phenyl, 3-chloro phenyl, 2-chloro phenyl,<br>
4-methoxy phenyl, 4-methyl phenyl, 2,4-dimethyl phenyl, 2,6-dimethyl phenyi. 2-fluoro<br>
phenyl, 2,4-fluoro phenyl, 1-napthyl, furfuryl, 3-nitro phenyl, (R)-(+)-α-methylbenzyl and<br>
wherein NCS is the thiocyanate group.<br>
The above mentioned alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates are obtained in almost quantitative<br>
yields from the reaction involving a thiophilic halogen preferably iodine nediated<br>
decomposition of dithiocarbamic acid salts in aprotic or polar protic solvent |. eferably<br>
acetonitrile (aprotic).<br>
The dithiocarbamic acid salts are easily prepared by the following known prior art' (J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1956, 21, 404, J. Org. Chem.1964, 29, 3098, J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 4539, J.<br>
Org. Chem. 2007, 72, 3969), obtained by treating an amine with carbon disalfide in<br>
presence of triethylamine. Also, the dithiocarbamate salts are freshly prepated filtered<br>
dried under vacuum prior to use.<br>
 <br>
Once the synthesis of the dithocarbamic acid salt is accomplished, a thiophilic reagent<br>
preferably iodine proved to be an effective reagent for the decomposition to the desired<br>
isothiocyanate in quantitative yield within 20-30 minutes in the presence of triethylamine or<br>
NaHCO3.<br>
In comparison to the present method of this invention the previously reported methods for<br>
dithiocarbamate decomposition were not as mild and high yielding.<br>
The reagent iodine for the decomposition of dithiocarbamate salt is non corrosive,<br>
inexpensive and environmentally safe. Thus the method provides an economically viable<br>
process for the preparation of isothiocyanates. The reaction is rapid and facile and<br>
accomplished under mild conditions. The product obtained is in high yields and high purity<br>
thereby needing no further purification. Aryl and alkyl isothiocyanates obtained by this<br>
process is very stable and have a long shelf life.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained here under in greater<br>
detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the following examples:<br>
Example I: Preparation of dithiocarbamic acid salt<br>
Synthesis for the preparation of the dithiocarbamic salt was carried out as depicted below in<br>
Scheme 1 (The procedure disclosed in J. Org. Chem. 1956, 21, 404 and J. Org. Chem.<br>
1964, 29, 3098, J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 4539, J. Org. Chem. 2007, 72, 3969), was<br>
followed for the purpose).<br>
 <br>
Scheme 1<br>
 <br>
Example II: Manufacture of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamic<br>
acid salt in organic solvent<br>
The phenyldithiocarbamate salt (540 mg, 2 mmol) obtained as above following Example 1,<br>
a base preferably triethylamine (417 μL, 3 mmol) was suspended in a solvent, acetonitrile<br>
(15 mL), which is cooled prior to reaction in an ice bath for 5 minutes. The reaction or<br>
decomposition of the dithiocarbamate salt was effected by the addition of a thiophilic<br>
halogen, iodine (508 mg, 2 mmol) by adding it in a controlled manner pinch wise. The<br>
reaction being exothermic addition of iodine in pinches was necessary while cooling for the<br>
reaction to proceed and to minimize the side products. Iodine was added in pinches over a<br>
period of 15-20 minutes. After iodine addition was over and 10 minutes after a TLC<br>
experiment on the reaction mixture was performed to reveal that the reaction was<br>
complete and overall time taken for the completion of the reaction was ~30 minutes. The<br>
precipitated sulphur was filtered and acetonitrile was evaporated in rotary evaporator<br>
under reduced pressure. The residue was redissolved in a water immiscible solvent,<br>
hexane (b. p. 60-70 °C). The hexane layer was washed with (2x5 mL) of 1N HCI solution<br>
and (2x2 mL) of 5% thiosulphate solution. The hexane layer was dried over anhydrous<br>
Na2SO4 and subsequently evaporated on a rotary evaporator to yield the pure alkyl and<br>
the aryl isothiocyanates (&gt;97% purity) in almost quantitative yield of 98 %. The above<br>
synthetic procedure followed is further briefly outlined below in Scheme 2 hereunder.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Example III: Manufacture of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamic<br>
acid salt in a biphasic medium of water and an organic solvent<br>
The phenyldithiocarbamate salt (540 mg, 2 mmol) obtained as above following Example I,<br>
was dissolved in water (10 mL) and layered with hexane (15 mL), a base preferably<br>
sodium bicarbonate (253 mg, 3 mmol) was added to it, which is cooled prior to reaction in<br>
an ice bath for 5 minutes. The reaction or decomposition of the dithiocarbamate salt was<br>
effected by the addition of a thiophilic halogen, iodine (508 mg, 2 mmol) by adding it in a<br>
controlled manner pinch wise. The reaction being exothermic addition of iodine in pinches<br>
was necessary while cooling for the reaction to proceed and to minimize the side products.<br>
Iodine was added in pinches over a period of 15-20 minutes. After iodine addition was<br>
over and 10 minutes after a TLC experiment on the reaction mixture was performed to<br>
reveal that the reaction was complete and overall time taken for the completion of the<br>
reaction was ~30 minutes. The hexane layer was separated and was washed with (2x5<br>
mL) of IN HCI solution and (2x2 mL) of 5% thiosulphate solution. The hexane layer was<br>
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and subsequently evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The<br>
product was dissolved in ethanol (5 mL) and precipitated elemental sulfur was removed by<br>
filtration. Ethanol layer was evaporated to yield the pure alkyl and the aryl isothiocyanates<br>
(&gt;97% purity) in almost quantitative yield of 96%. The above synthetic procedure<br>
followed is further briefly outlined below in Scheme 3 hereunder.<br>
 <br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. All<br>
percentages are by weight.<br>
 <br>
The above exemplary illustration of the process of the invention clearly reveals the efficient,<br>
economic and environment friendly method for the preparation of alkyl and<br>
arylisothiocyanates directed to overcome the difficulties associated with what is already<br>
known in the art in its preparative process. Importantly, it is found by way of the invention<br>
that Iodine being highly thiophilic (electrophilic) in nature can interact with sulphur<br>
(nucleophile) thus assisting the desulphurization process. This is facilitated by the<br>
abstraction of NH protons by triethylamine / NaHCO3 present as a base in the reaction<br>
medium. Formation of elemental sulfur as the sole byproduct of the reaction supports the<br>
mechanism as proposed in Scheme 2. Performing the reaction under ice-cold conditions<br>
minimizes the side products. Thus the preferred use of iodine as a thiophilic reagent favours<br>
decomposition of pre-synthesized dithiocarbamate salts to isothiocyanates. Controlled<br>
addition of iodine in pinches over a time span of 15-20 minutes in the reaction flask is a<br>
prerequisite to prevent side reactions. The mechanism for the formation of alkyl and aryl<br>
isothiocyanates is further illustrated in the following Scheme 4.<br>
 <br>
Thus the examples clearly illustrate an overall simple, fast and efficient process for the<br>
manufacture of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates.<br>
The above process is quick in yielding the said isothiocyanates in a short time span of ~30<br>
minutes, more preferably within 15 minutes and in &gt;97% pure form in near quantitative<br>
yields of &gt;95% more preferably &gt;99%. It is also noteworthy that the process is very<br>
economical for the inexpensive nature and easy commercial availability of the reagents<br>
employed.<br>
 <br>
Advantageously the process provided in this invention is environmentally safe for the non<br>
corrosive, non toxic nature of the reagents and mild basic conditions needed for the<br>
process. Accordingly the process provided in this invention is favourable with respect to<br>
easy handling of the reagents which are moisture insensitive and non lachrymators.<br>
The advantage associated with the above said process also resides in the easily isolable<br>
and harmless byproduct such as sulphur which can be separated by simple filtration. The<br>
above process is advantageously also energy efficient since no external heating is<br>
required.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a process for the<br>
manufacture of alkyl and aryl isothiocyanates which is efficient in terms of energy needed<br>
for activation for the formation of products from reactants, time required and highly pure<br>
isolated yields of the product. The process is environment friendly especially in terms of<br>
non toxic nature of the reagents needed, mild reaction conditions employed and the<br>
harmless by product obtained. It is easy to operate in terms of the moisture insensitive<br>
and non lachrymator reagents needed for the purpose.<br>
