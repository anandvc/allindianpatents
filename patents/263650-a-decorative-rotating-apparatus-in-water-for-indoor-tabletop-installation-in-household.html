7.0	Description of the Invention<br>
7.1	The present invention particularly relates to an apparatus (100), having decorative application, for indoor, tabletop installation in household. It comprises<br>
(i)      a howl (01) of glass or of plastic construction, preferably having a narrow bottom (O1l) and wide top (012), filled with water. The said bowl (01) preferably is placed on a table-top in a corner away from artificial or natural breeze, (ii)        a guide rod seat (02), permanently fixed to centre point (013) of the said bottom (011) of and on inside of the said bowl (01). The said guide rod seat (02) is constructed of a plastic bush which is open at top. (III)      a guide rod (03), constructed of plastic. It has a circular cross section, solid, measuring in length about 10 inches and has a diameter smaller than the internal diameter of the said guide rod seat (02). (iv)     a holder plate (04), constructed of plastic in suitable thiclaiess in the shape a plurality of curved arms (04-1, 04-2, 04-3, 04-4, 04-5 and preferably 04-6 ) that converge at centre point (042) of the said holder plate (04) and end at other ends into respective circular open seats (04-1S, 04-2S, 04-3S, 04-4S, 04-<br>
6<br><br>
5S and preferably 04-6S) The said centre point (042) has a hole (043) of diameter larger than the diameter of the said guide rod (03). The said arms (04-1, 04-2, 04-3, 04-4, 04-5 and 04-6) are curved in counter-clockwise direction and extend symmetrically towards periphery of the said bowl (01) while clearing the said periphery of the said bowl (01), when the said guide rod (03) is inserted through the said centre point (042) of the said holder plate (04) and is fitted vertically into the said guide rod seat (02), with water filled in the said bowl (01). a plurality of oil lamps (05-1, 05-2, 05-3, 05-4, 05-5 and preferably 05-6), constructed of plastic, resembling in shape the said bowl (01). The said oil lamps (05-1, 05-2, 05-3, 05-4, 05-5 and preferably 05-6) are placed - for the purpose of working the said apparatus (100) - respectively into the said open seats (04-1S, 04-2S, 04-3S, 04-4S, 04-5S and preferably 04-6S), are filled with oil and are lighted in a comer atop a table away from artificial or natural air breeze, an impeller (06), constructed of plurality plastic blades (06-1, 06-2, 06-3, 06-4, 06-5 and preferably 06-6). The said blades (06-1, 06-2, 06-3, 06-4, 06-5 and preferably 06-6) are<br>
7<br><br>
coconut-tree-leaves-shaped and are fitted symmetrically and converge at the other ends into a central disc (061). The said central disc (061) has circular hole of a diameter greater than the diameter of the said guide rod (03), such that the said blades are positioned in a plane horizontal and parallel to the water level in the said bowl (01), forming an umbrella over the said water level in the said bowl (01). The said blades (06-1, 06-2, 06-3, 06-4, 06-5 and preferably 06-6) are preferably of the shape of coconut plant leaves, with each leave having a central corridor running longitudinally the entire length and a series of angularly, positioned, parallel vanes on both sides of the said central corridor (061).<br>
The said blades (06-1, 06-2, 06-3, 06-4, 06-5 and preferably 06-6) are positioned concavely to the said water level in the said bowl (01) and are tilted in counter-clockwise direction by an angle of 5Â° - 15Â° with respect to the horizontal plane the said blades (06-1, 06-2, 06-3, 06-4, 06-5 and 06-6) scrap. The said impeller (06) rests firmly and secured atop one top end (031) of the vertically held said guide rod (03) and the said other end (032) of the said guide rod (03) is held firmly<br>
8<br><br>
and secured inside the said guide rod seat (02) through the water column inside the said bowl (01).<br>
7.5	The said holder plate (04) firmly grips the said guide rod<br>
(03) at a point closer to the said bottom end (032), while floating on the said water level inside the said bowl (01).<br>
7.6	The depth of the said water in the said bowl (01) is between 1.5 inches to 2 inches.<br>
7.7	The said bottom end (032) of the said guide rod (03) is<br>
suspended in water just above the bottom of the said bowl (01) and stays clear from touching or scrapping the bottom of the said bowl (01) during the working of the said apparatus (100).<br>
7.8	The said guide rod (03) is perpendicularly held with respect to water level in the said bowl (01).<br>
7.9	The said oil lamps (05-1, 05-2, 05-3, 05-4, 05-5 and preferably 05-6) are filled with oil and are lighted for the working of this apparatus (100), placed in a corner atop a table and away from<br>
natural or artificial air breeze.<br>
8.0	Best Method of Operating the Invention:<br>
8.1	Place an empty bowl in a corner of a room atop a table top and<br>
ensure the selected spot has no natural or artificial air breeze. Air currents hamper working of the invention. Best time for working<br>
9<br><br>
the invention is after sunset.<br>
Fill the bowl with water.. Place oil lamps (5 or 6 in number) in lamp seats of the holder plate (04) and light them. As air above the lighted lamps gets warmer, it rises, causing the surrounding air to rush in its place. The rising hot air currents gently push the impeller vanes. As the apparatus (100), including the impeller (06), the holder plate (04) on water surface and the guide rod (03), are suspended in either water column, air or on water surface and are frictionless for all practical purposes, the gentle push given by the rising air currents on the impeller (06) blades causes rotation of the impeller (06), which in turn rotates the holder plate (04) in clockwise direction. The rotation begins a few seconds after the said lamps are lighted and continues until the last lamp is blown off.<br>
Rotation of the umbrella-shaped impeller (06) and the assembly of the oil lamps against water in a glass bowl creates a pleasant effect and enhances the aesthetic appeal of the area.<br>
