				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a hexagonal<br>
ferrite sintered magnet, and generally to a hexagonal ferrite suitably used as a<br>
permanent magnet material such as a motor for an automobile, and particularly<br>
relates to a magnet material containing a hexagonal magnetoplumbite ferrite,<br>
and a process for producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As an oxide permanent magnet material, a strontium<br>
(Sr) ferrite and a barium (Ba) ferrite, which are of a<br>
magnetoplumbite (M type) hexagonal structure, are mainly<br>
used, and they are produced as a sintered magnet and a<br>
bonded magnet.<br>
What are important among characteristics of a magnet<br>
are a residual magnetic flux density (Br) and an intrinsic<br>
coercive force (HcJ).<br>
Br is determined by the density of the magnet, the<br>
degree of orientation of the magnet, and the saturation<br>
magnetization (4ls) determined by the crystal structure.<br>
Br is expressed by the following equation:<br>
Br = 4ΠIS x (degree of orientation) x (density)<br><br>
The Sr ferrite and the Ba ferrite of M type has a 4ΠIS<br>
value of about 4.65 kG. The density and the degree of<br>
orientation each is about 98% at most in the sintered<br>
magnet, which provides the highest values. Therefore, Br<br>
of these magnets is limited to about 4.46 kG at most, and<br>
it has been substantially impossible to provide a high Br<br>
value of 4.5 kG or more.<br>
The inventor of the invention have found that the<br>
addition of appropriate amounts of La and Zn in an M type<br>
ferrite raises its 4ΠIS value by about 200 G at most, and a<br>
Br value of 4.5 kG or more can be obtained, as described in<br>
US Patent Application Serial No. 08/672,848. In this case,<br>
however, since the anisotropic magnetic field (HA) , which<br>
will be described later, is decreased, it is difficult to<br>
obtain a Br value of 4.5 kG or more and an HcJ of 3.5 kOe<br>
or more at the same time.<br>
HeJ is in proportion to the product (HA x fc) of the<br>
anisotropic magnetic field (HA = 2K1/Is) and a single<br>
magnetic domain grain fraction (fc), in which K1 represents<br>
a crystal magnetic anisotropy constant, which is determined<br>
by the crystal structure as similar to Is. The M type Ba<br>
ferrite has K1 of 3.3 x 106 erg/cm3, and the M type Sr<br>
ferrite has K1 of 3.5 x 106 erg/cm3. It has been known that<br>
the M type Sr ferrite has the largest K1. value, but it has<br><br>
been difficult to further raise the K1 value.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where ferrite<br>
particles are in a single magnetic domain condition, the<br>
maximum HcJ is expected because the magnetization must be<br>
rotated against the anisotropic magnetic field to reverse<br>
the magnetization. In order to make ferrite particles into<br>
single magnetic domain particles, the size of the ferrite<br>
particles must be smaller than the following critical<br>
diameter (dc) expressed by the following equation:<br>
dc = 2(k.Tc.k/a)1/2/Is2<br>
wherein k represents the Boltzman constant, Tc represents a<br>
Curie temperature, and a represents a distance between iron<br>
ions. In the case of the M type Sr ferrite, since dc is<br>
about 1 µm, it is necessary for producing a sintered magnet<br>
that the crystal grain size of the sintered magnet must be<br>
controlled to 1 µm or less. While it has been difficult to<br>
realize such a fine crystal grain and the high density and<br>
the high degree of orientation to provide a high Br at the<br>
same time, the inventor has proposed a new production<br>
process to demonstrate that superior characteristics that<br>
cannot be found in the art are obtained, as described in US<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 08/072,967. In this process,<br>
however, the HcJ value becomes 4.0 kOe when the Br value is<br><br>
4.4 kG, and therefore it has been difficult to obtain a<br>
high HeJ of 4.5 kOe or more with maintaining a high Br of<br>
4.4 kG or more at the same time.<br>
In order to control a crystal grain size of a<br>
sintered body to 1 nm or less, it is necessary to make the<br>
powder size in the molding step 0.5 µm or less with taking<br>
the growth of the grains in the sintering step into<br>
consideration. The use of such fine particles brings about<br>
a problem in that the productivity is generally<br>
deteriorated due to increase in molding time and increase<br>
in generation of cracks on molding. Thus, it has been very<br>
difficult to realize high characteristics and high<br>
productivity at the same time.<br>
It has been known that the addition of A12O3 and Cr2O3<br>
is effective to obtain a high HcJ value. In this case, Al3+<br>
and Cr3+ have effects of increasing HA and suppressing the<br>
grain growth by substituting for Fe3+ having an upward spin<br>
in the M type structure, so that a high HcJ value of 4.5<br>
kOe or more is obtained. However, when the Is value is<br>
reduced, the Br value is considerably reduced since the<br>
sintered density is reduced. As a result, the composition<br>
exhibiting the maximum HeJ of 4.5 kOe can only provide a Br<br>
value of 4.2 kG.<br>
A sintered magnet of the conventional anisotropic M<br>
type ferrite has a temperature dependency of HcJ of about<br><br>
+13 Oe/°C and a relatively high temperature coefficient of<br>
about from +0.3 to +0.5%/°C, which sometimes bring about<br>
great reduction in HcJ on the low temperature side and thus<br>
demagnetization. In order to prevent such demagnetization,<br>
the HcJ value at room temperature must be a large value of<br>
about 5 kOe, and therefore it is substantially impossible<br>
to obtain a high Br value at the same time. Powder of an<br>
isotropic M type ferrite has a temperature dependency of<br>
HcJ of at least about +8 Oe/°C, although it is superior to<br>
the anisotropic sintered magnet, and a temperature<br>
coefficient of +0.15%/°C. and thus it has been difficult to<br>
further improve the temperature characteristics. Because a<br>
ferrite magnet is excellent in environmental resistance and<br>
is not expensive, it is frequently used in a motor in<br>
various parts of an automobile. Because an automobile may<br>
be used under severe conditions including intense cold and<br>
heat, the motor is required to stably function under such<br>
severe conditions. However, the conventional ferrite<br>
magnet has a problem of considerable deterioration in<br>
coercive force under low temperature conditions, as<br>
described in the foregoing.<br>
Even though a ferrite magnet satisfies such<br>
characteristics, it has a problem in that those having a<br>
low squareness (Hk/HcJ) in the demagnetization curve have a<br>
low (BH)max and a deteriorated change with time.<br><br>
If a magnet having a high degree of orientation,<br>
which is obtained by the production process using an<br>
organic solvent system, can be obtained by a production<br>
process using an aqueous solvent, the production becomes<br>
easy to provide advantages in productivity, and moreover it<br>
does not lead environmental contamination to make possible<br>
to omit apparatuses for preventing contamination.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a ferrite<br>
magnet and a process for producing the same, which has a<br>
high residual magnetic flux density and a high coercive<br>
force that cannot be attained by the conventional M type<br>
ferrite magnet, is excellent in temperature characteristics<br>

Function and Effective<br>
As a result of investigations with respect to<br>
improvement in the magnetic characteristics made by the<br>
inventors, it has been found that superior characteristics<br>
is obtained by a magnetoplumbite ferrite, as described in<br>
(Japanese Patent Application No. 9-56856). However, the<br>
ferrite material having this composition only provides a<br>
squareness of from 80 to 90% by the conventional production<br>
process, where the addition is conducted at the mixing of<br>
the raw materials. On the other hand, the inventors has<br>
proposed a production process, in which a high degree of<br>
orientation can be obtained by an aqueous process, as<br>
described in US Patent Application Serial No. 08/984,087.<br>
However, even when such a process is employed, it is not<br>
sufficient as compared with a degree of orientation Ir/Is<br>
of from 97 to 98% obtained by a process using an organic<br>
solvent system proposed in US Patent Application Serial No.<br>
08/072,967.<br><br>
As a result of earnest investigations made by the<br>
inventor taking these factors into consideration, it has<br>
been found that a magnet having a high squareness can be<br>
obtained by a magnetoplumbite ferrite having a structure<br>
exhibiting two different Curie temperatures, as described<br>
in Japanese Patent Application No. 9-56856 described above.<br>
Furthermore, the employment of this structure can reduce<br>
the content of Co.<br>
It has been also found at the same time that as one<br>
process for producing the structure, it is suitable to add<br>
a compound containing at least one element selected from Sr<br>
or Ba, R (where R represents rare earth elements including<br>
Y), Co and Fe (i.e., oxides of these elements and compounds<br>
that are converted into the oxides) on the step of<br>
preparing a slurry for molding, preferably on the wet<br>
pulverizing step or the dry pulverizing step. It has been<br>
also found that by employing this production process, a<br>
high degree of orientation that is obtained by the organic<br>
solvent system can be obtained by using an aqueous<br>
dispersant system.<br>
A preferred composition of the M type Sr ferrite of<br>
the invention is a composition containing at least optimum<br>
amounts of La and Co. As a result, while Is is not lowered,<br>
rather Is and K1. are simultaneously increased to increase<br>
HA. and thus a high Br value and a hiqh HcJ value are<br><br>
realized. Specifically, in the sintered magnet of the<br>
invention, satisfactory characteristics can be obtained<br>
when the coercive force HcJ (unit: kOe) and the residual<br>
magnetic flux density Br (unit: kG) satisfy the following<br>
conditions at an ordinary temperature of about 25°C:<br>
When HcJ &gt; 4<br>
Br + 1/3HCJ &gt; 5.75	(I)<br>
When HcJ 
Br + 1/10HcJ &gt; 4.82	(II)<br>
It has been reported that the conventional Sr ferrite<br>
sintered magnet exhibits Br of 4.4 kG and HcJ of 4.0 kOe,<br>
but none has been obtained that has HcJ of 4 kOe or more<br>
and satisfies the equation (I). In other words, if HcJ is<br>
increased, Br must be low. In the sintered magnet of the<br>
invention, although the combination addition of Co and Zn<br>
lowers the coercive force lower than the case of the single<br>
addition of Co, in some cases lower than 4 kOe, the<br>
residual magnetic flux density is considerably increased.<br>
At this time, the magnetic characteristics satisfying the<br>
equation (II) are obtained. There has been no conventional<br>
Sr ferrite sintered magnet having HcJ of less than 4 kOe<br>
that satisfies the equation (II).<br><br>
Because the ferrite of the invention has an<br>
anisotropy constant Kx and an anisotropic magnetic field<br>
(HA) larger than the conventional ferrite, a larger HcJ can<br>
be obtained with the same grain size, and the grain size<br>
can be reduced with the same HcJ to be obtained. For<br>
example, an HcJ value of 4.5 kOe or more can be obtained<br>
with an average grain diameter of the sintered body of from<br>
0.3 to 1 µm, and even in the case of from 1 to 2 µm, an HcJ<br>
value of 3.5 kOe or more can be obtained. Accordingly, the<br>
time for pulverization and molding can be reduced, and the<br>
improvement in yield of the product can be realized.<br>
While the invention exhibits a greater effect of<br>
enhancing the HcJ when applied to a sintered magnet,<br>
ferrite powder produced according to the invention can be<br>
mixed with a binder, such as plastics and rubber, to form a<br>
bonded magnet.<br>
Furthermore, a coating type magnetic recording medium<br>
can be obtained in such a manner that a coating composition<br>
is prepared by mixing and kneading the magnet powder with a<br>
binder, and the coating composition is coated on a<br>
substrate comprising a resin or the like, followed by<br>
hardening if necessary, to form a magnetic layer.<br>
The magnet material of the invention has a small<br>
temperature dependency of HcJ, and particularly the magnet<br>
powder of the invention has a considerably small<br><br>
temperature dependency of HcJ. Specifically, the sintered<br>
magnet of the invention has an absolute value of a<br>
temperature coefficient of HcJ within a range of from -50<br>
to 50°C of 0.25%/°C or less, which can be easily reduced to<br>
0.20%/°C or less. The magnet powder of the invention has<br>
an absolute value of a temperature coefficient of HcJ<br>
within a range of from -50 to 50°C of 0.1%°C or less, which<br>
can be easily reduced to 0.05%/°C or less. Owing to such<br>
good temperature characteristics of HcJ, the excellent<br>
magnetic characteristics satisfying the equation (V) can be<br>
obtained. Such superior magnetic characteristics under the<br>
low temperature environment cannot be attained by the<br>
conventional Sr ferrite magnet.<br>
A Ba ferrite represented by the following formula:<br>
Ba1-xM3+xFe12-xM2+xOl9<br>
is disclosed in Bull. Acad. Set. USSR, phys. Ser. (English<br>
Transl.), vol. 25 (1961), pp. 1405-1408 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as Reference 1). In this Ba ferrite, M3+ is<br>
La3+, Pr3+ or Bi3+, and M2+ is Co2+ or Ni2+. While it is not<br>
clear as to whether Ba ferrite of Reference 1 is powder or<br>
a sintered body, this is similar to the Sr ferrite of the<br>
invention in the point of inclusion of La and Co. Fig. 1<br>
of Reference 1 shows the change of saturation magnetization<br><br>
depending on the change of x for a Ba ferrite containing La<br>
and Co, but in Fig. 1, the saturation magnetization is<br>
reduced with the increase of x. Although Reference 1<br>
discloses that the coercive force increases by a few times,<br>
there is not disclosure of specific values.<br>
In the invention, on the other hand, by employing the<br>
composition, to which the optimum amounts of La and Co are<br>
added, for the Sr ferrite magnet, the considerable increase<br>
of HcJ and the slight increase of Br are realized, and the<br>
considerable improvement in temperature dependency of HcJ<br>
is also realized. In the invention, by adding the optimum<br>
amounts of La and Co to the Sr ferrite magnet powder, the<br>
HcJ is greatly increased and its temperature dependency is<br>
considerably reduced. It is firstly found in the invention<br>
that the combination addition of La and Co to a Sr ferrite<br>
provides such effects.<br>
A Ba ferrite represented by the following formula:<br>
La3+Me2*Fe3+nO19<br>
(Me2*: Cu2+ Cd2+ Zn2+, Ni2+ Co2+ or Mg2+)<br>
is disclosed in Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Physics.<br>
vol. 8, July 1970, pp.412-415 (hereinafter referred to as<br>
Reference 2). This ferrite is similar to the magnet<br>
material of the invention in the point of inclusion of La<br>
and Co. However, in Reference 2, the saturation<br><br>
magnetization as when M2+ is Co2+ is such low values of 42<br>
cgs unit at room temperature and 50 cgs unit at OK. While<br>
specific values are not disclosed, Reference 2 states that<br>
it cannot be a magnet material due to a low coercive force.<br>
It is considered this is because the composition of the<br>
ferrite of Reference 2 deviates the scope of the invention<br>
(the amounts of La and Co are larger than the invention).<br>
An isometric hexagonal ferrite pigment represented by<br>
the following formula:<br>
Mx(I)My(II)Mz(III)Fe12-(y+z)O19<br>
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 62-<br>
100417 (hereinafter referred to as Reference 3). In the<br>
formula, M(I) is a combination of Sr, Ba, a rare earth<br>
metal, etc. with a monovalent cation; M(II) is Fe(II), Mn,<br>
Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd or Mg; and M(III) is Ti, etc. The<br>
hexagonal ferrite pigment disclosed in Reference 3 is<br>
similar to the magnet material of the invention in the<br>
point that a rare earth metal and Co are simultaneously<br>
contained. However, Reference 3 does not disclose any<br>
example in that La and Co are simultaneously added, and<br>
there is no disclosure that the simultaneous addition of<br>
them improves the saturation magnetization and the coercive<br>
force. Furthermore, in the examples of Reference 3 where<br><br>
Co is added, Ti is simultaneously added as the element of<br>
M(III). Because the element of M(III), particularly Ti.<br>
functions as an element lowering the saturation<br>
magnetization and the coercive force, it is clear that<br>
Reference 3 does not suggest the constitution and the<br>
effect of the invention.<br>
An optomagnetic recording medium comprising a<br>
magnetoplumbite barium ferrite characterized by<br>
substituting a part of Ba with La and a part of Fe with Co<br>
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 62-<br>
119760 (hereinafter referred to as Reference 4). This Ba<br>
ferrite is similar to the Sr ferrite of the invention in<br>
the point of inclusion of La and Co. However, the ferrite<br>
of Reference 4 is a material for "optomagnetic recording",<br>
in which information is written as a magnetic domain in a<br>
magnetic thin film by utilizing a heat effect of light, and<br>
the information is read out by utilizing a optomagnetic<br>
effect, which is of a technical field different from the<br>
magnet material of the invention. Furthermore, in<br>
Reference 4, Ba, La and Co are essential in the<br>
compositional formula (I), and in the formulae (II) and<br>
(III), there is only disclosed that an unidentified tetra-<br>
valent metallic ion is added thereto. On the other hand,<br>
the ferrite of the invention is the Sr ferrite, in which Sr<br>
is essential, and the optimum amounts of La and Co are<br><br>
added thereto, which is different from the composition of<br>
Reference 4. That is, as explained with respect to<br>
Reference 1, the Sr ferrite of the invention realizes the<br>
considerable increase of HcJ and the slight increase of Br,<br>
and also realizes the considerable improvement in<br>
temperature dependency of HcJ, by using the composition of<br>
the Sr ferrite magnet containing the optimum amounts of La<br>
and Co. The effects can be obtained when the combination<br>
addition of La and Co is applied to the Sr ferrite, and is<br>
realized in the composition of the invention, which is<br>
different from Reference 4.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The magnet material of the invention comprising a<br>
primary phase of a hexagonal magnetoplumbite ferrite<br>
containing Sr or Ba, Co and R, where R represents at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of rare<br>
earth elements including Y, and Bi, wherein the magnet<br>
material has at least two different Curie temperatures Tcl<br>
and Tc2, the two different Curie temperatures are present<br>
within a range of from 400 to 470°C, and an absolute value<br>
of a difference therebetween is 5°C or more. Thus, the<br>
magnet material has two different Curie temperatures,<br>
whereby the squareness Hk/KcJ is markedly improved.<br>
The Curie temperature can be obtained from an<br>
inflection point of a magnetization a - temperature T curve<br><br>
of a magnet. Specifically, it is obtained from the<br>
temperature of the point of intersection of the tangent<br>
line of the low temperature side curve at the inflection<br>
point of the a-T curve and the temperature axis. The two<br>
different Curie temperatures Tc1 and Tc2 exhibit the<br>
absolute value of the difference therebetween of 5°C or<br>
more, preferably 10°C or more. The upper limit thereof is<br>
not particularly limited, but it is generally about 465°C.<br>
These Curie temperatures fall within the range of from 400<br>
to 470°C, preferably from 430 to 460°C. It is considered<br>
that the two Curie temperature mean that the constructional<br>
structure of the ferrite crystal of the invention has a<br>
two-phase structure of an M type ferrite different in<br>
magnetic properties due to the production process described<br>
later, provided that a single phase of an M phase is<br>
observed by ordinary X-ray diffractiometry.<br>
The squareness Hk/HcJ is preferably 90% or more, more<br>
preferably 92% or more, which becomes 95% at most. The<br>
magnet of the invention preferably has a degree of<br>
orientation Ir/Is of 96.5% or more, more preferably 97% or<br>
more, which becomes about 98% at most. A high Br value can<br>
be obtained by increasing the degree of orientation. Since<br>
the degree of magnetic orientation of a molded body is<br>
influenced by the density of the molded body, the<br>
crystallographic degree of orientation (X-ray degree of<br><br>
orientation) is important, which is obtained from the plane<br>
index and the intensity of the peaks appearing in the X-ray<br>
diffractiometry measurement result of the surface of the<br>
molded body. The X-ray degree of orientation of the molded<br>
body controls the degree of magnetic orientation of a<br>
sintered body to a certain extent. Preferably, 2l(00L)/2<br>
I(hkL) is used as the X-ray degree of orientation. (00L)<br>
is an expression of the generic name of the c planes such<br>
as (004) and (006), and ∑I(OOL) is a total intensity of the<br>
peaks of all (00L) planes. (hkL) means all the peaks<br>
detected, and 21(hkL) is a total intensity thereof. Thus,<br>
ZI(OOL) /Zl(hkL) means the degree of c plane orientation. 2<br>
I(00L)/2I(hkL) is preferably 0.85 or more, more preferably<br>
0.9 or more, the upper limit of which is about 1.0. In the<br>
following examples, this is expressed by 21(001)/2l(hkl) in<br>
some cases.<br>
The magnet of the invention comprises a primary phase<br>
of a hexagonal magnetoplumbite ferrite containing Sr or Ba,<br>
Co and R, where R represents at least one element selected<br>
from the group consisting of rare earth elements /including<br>
Y, and Bi, wherein the primary phase is preferably at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of Sr, Ba,<br>
Ca and Pb, and when A represents an element essentially<br>
including Sr or Ba, R represents at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of rare earth elements<br><br>
including Y, and Bi, and M represents Co, or Co and Zn, the<br>
proportions of the elements A, R, Fe and M with respect to<br>
the total amount of the metallic elements are<br>
from 1 to 13 atomic% for A,<br>
from 0.05 to 10 atomic% for R,<br>
from 80 to 95 atomic% for Fe, and<br>
from 0.1 to 5 atomic% for M.<br>
These are more preferably<br>
from 3 to 11 atomic% for A,<br>
from 0.2 to 6 atomic% for R,<br>
from 83 to 94 atomic% for Fe, and<br>
from 0.3 to 4 atomic% for M.<br>
These are particularly preferably<br>
from 3 to 9 atomic% for A,<br>
from 0.5 to 4 atomic% for R,<br>
from 86 to 93 atomic% for Fe, and<br>
from 0.5 to 3 atomic% for M.<br>
In the constitutional elements, A is at least one<br>
element selected from the group consisting of Sr, Ba, Ca<br>
and Pb. When the amount of A is too small, the M type<br>
ferrite is not formed, or the amount of a non-magnetic<br>
phase, such as -Fe2O3, is increased. When the amount of A<br>
is too large, the M type ferrite is not formed, or the<br>
amount of a non-magnetic phase, such as SrFeO3-x, is<br>
increased. The proportion of Sr in A is preferably 51<br><br>
atomic% or more, more preferably 70 atomlc% or more, and<br>
especially preferably 100 atomic%. When the proportion of<br>
Sr in A is too small, the improvement in saturation<br>
magnetization and the considerable improvement in coercive<br>
force is difficult to be obtained at the same time.<br>
R is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of rare earth elements including Y, and Bi. It<br>
is preferred that R essentially contains La, Nd and Pr,<br>
particularly La. When the amount of R is too small, the<br>
amount of M forming a solid solution becomes small, and<br>
thus the effect of the invention is difficult to be<br>
obtained. The amount of R is too large, the amount of a<br>
non-magnetic foreign phase, such as ortho-ferrite, becomes<br>
large. The proportion of La in R is preferably 40 atomic%<br>
or more, more preferably 70 atomic% or more, and it is most<br>
preferred to use only La as R from for the improvement in<br>
saturation magnetization. This is because La exhibits the<br>
largest limiting amount forming a solid solution with a<br>
hexagonal M type ferrite. Therefore, when the proportion<br>
of La in R is too small, the amount of R forming a solid<br>
solution cannot become large, and as a result, the amount<br>
of the element M forming a solid solution also cannot<br>
become large, which reduces the effect of the invention.<br>
The combination use of Bi lowers the calcination<br>
temperature and the sintering temperature, and is<br><br>
advantageous from the standpoint of productivity.<br>
The element M is Co, or Co and Zn. When the amount<br>
of M is too small, the effect of the invention is difficult<br>
to be obtained. When the amount of M is too large, Br and HcJ are reduced, and the effect of the invention is<br>
difficult to be obtained. The proportion of Co in M is<br>
preferably 10 atomic% or more, more preferably 20 atomic%<br>
or more. When the proportion of Co is too small, the<br>
improvement in coercive force becomes insufficient.<br>
The hexagonal magnetoplumbite ferrite is preferably<br>
represented by the following formula:<br>
A1-xRx(Fe12-yMy)zO19,<br>
wherein<br>
0.04 s x s 0.9, particularly 0.04 s; x s 0.6,<br>
0.04 
0.8s x/y s 5, and<br>
0.7 s z s 1.2.<br>
It is more preferably<br>
0.04 s x 
0.04 
0.8 
0.7 s z s 1.2.<br>
It is particularly preferably<br><br>
0.1 
O.lsys 0.4, and<br>
0.8 
and especially preferably<br>
0.9 
In the above formula, when x is too small, i.e., the<br>
amount of the element R is too small, the amount of the<br>
element M forming a solid solution with the hexagonal<br>
ferrite cannot be large, and thus the improving effect of<br>
the saturation magnetization and/or the improving effect of<br>
the anisotropic magnetic field become insufficient. When x<br>
is too large, the element R cannot substitute in the<br>
hexagonal ferrite to form a solid solution, and the<br>
saturation magnetization is reduced due to the formation of<br>
an ortho-ferrite containing the element R. When y is too<br>
small, the improving effect of the saturation magnetization<br>
and/or the improving effect of the anisotropic magnetic<br>
filed becomes insufficient. When y is too large, the<br>
element M is difficult to substitute in the hexagonal<br>
ferrite to form a solid solution. Even in the range where<br>
the element M can substitute to form a solid solution,<br>
deterioration of the anisotropic constant (Kx) and the<br>
anisotropic magnetic field (HA) becomes large. When z is<br>
too small, the saturation magnetization is reduced since<br>
the amounts of non-magnetic phases containing Sr and the<br><br>
element R are increased. When z is too large, the<br>
saturation magnetization is reduced since the amount of an<br>
a-Fe2O3 phase or a non-magnetic spinel ferrite phase<br>
containing the element M is increased. The above formula<br>
assumes that no impurity is contained.<br>
In the formula above, when x/y is either too small or<br>
too large, the valences of the element R and the element M<br>
cannot be balanced, and a foreign phase, such as a W type<br>
ferrite, is liable to be formed. As the element M is<br>
divalent, when the element R is trivalent, x/y is ideally 1.<br>
The reason why the permissible range of x/y is largely<br>
extended to the direction of more than 1 is that even if y<br>
is small, the valences can be balanced by the reduction<br>
from Fe3+ to Fe2+.<br>
In the above formula showing the composition, the<br>
number of oxygen atoms of 19 means the stoichiometric<br>
compositional ratio when all the elements R are trivalent,<br>
and x = y and z = 1. Thus, the number of oxygen atoms<br>
changes depending on the kind of the element R and the<br>
values of x, y and z. In the case where the sintering<br>
atmosphere is a reducing atmosphere, there is a possibility<br>
of forming lack of oxygen (vacancy). Furthermore, while Fe<br>
is generally present as trivalent in the M type ferrite,<br>
there is a possibility of changing it to divalent. There<br>
is a possibility that the valence of the element<br><br>
represented by M, such as Co, is changed, and the<br>
proportion of oxygen to the metallic elements is also<br>
changed according thereto. While the number of oxygen<br>
atoms is shown as 19 irrespective to the kind of R and the<br>
values of x, y and z in the specification, the actual<br>
number of oxygen atoms may be somewhat deviated from the<br>
stoichiometric compositional ratio.<br>
The composition of a ferrite can be measured by<br>
fluorescent X-ray quantitative analysis. The presence of<br>
the primary phase described above is confirmed by X-ray<br>
diffraction and electron beam diffraction.<br>
The magnet powder may contain B2O3. The calcination<br>
temperature and the sintering temperature can be lowered by<br>
the addition of B2O3, which is advantageous from the<br>
standpoint of productivity. The content of B2O3 is<br>
preferably 0.5% by weight or less based on the total amount<br>
of the magnet powder. When the content of B2O3 is too large,<br>
the saturation magnetization becomes low.<br>
At least one of Na, K and Rb may be contained in the<br>
magnet powder. The total content of these elements, as<br>
converted into Na20, K20 and Rb2O, is preferably 3% by<br>
weight or less based on the total amount of the magnet<br>
powder. When the content of these element is too large,<br>
the saturation magnetization becomes low. As these<br>
elements are represented by MI, MI are contained in the<br><br>
ferrite in the form of the following formula:<br>
Sr1.3-2aRaMIa-0.3Fe11.7M0.3O19<br>
In this case, it is preferred that 0.3 
is too large, the saturation magnetization becomes low, and<br>
additionally a problem arises in that a large amount of the<br>
element M1 is evaporated on sintering.<br>
In addition to these impurities. Si, Al Ga, In, Li,<br>
Mg, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Ti, Zr, Ge, Sn, V, Nb. Ta, Sb, As, W<br>
and Mo may be contained in the form of oxides in an amount<br>
of 1% by weight or less for silicon oxide, 5% by weight or<br>
less for aluminum oxide, 5% by weight or less for gallium<br>
oxide, 3% by weight or less for indium oxide, 1% by weight<br>
or less for lithium oxide, 3% by weight or less for<br>
magnesium oxide, 3% by weight or less for manganese oxide,<br>
3% by weight or less for nickel oxide, 5% by weight or less<br>
chromium oxide, 3% by weight or less for copper oxide, 3%<br>
by weight or less for titanium oxide, 3% by weight or less<br>
for zirconium oxide, 3% by weight or less for germanium<br>
oxide, 3% by weight or less for tin oxide, 3% by weight or<br>
less for vanadium oxide, 3% by weight or less for niobium<br>
oxide, 3% by weight or less for tantalum oxide, 3% by<br>
weight or less for antimony oxide, 3% by weight or less for<br>
arsenic oxide, 3% by weight or less for tungsten oxide, and<br><br>
3% by weight or less for molybdenum oxide.<br>
The process for producing the sintered magnet is<br>
described below.<br>
In the process for producing the sintered magnet<br>
containing the above-described ferrite, iron oxide powder<br>
and powder of compounds containing Fe, Sr or Ba, Co, R<br>
(wherein R represents at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of rare earth elements Including Y)<br>
and Bi are used, and one kind of these raw material powder<br>
or a mixture of two or more kinds thereof is calcined.<br>
After calcination, one kind or two or more kinds of<br>
compounds containing Fe, Sr, Co, R (wherein R represents at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
rare earth elements including Y) and Bi are added and mixed,<br>
and then sintered. The powder of compounds containing Fe,<br>
Sr, Co, R (wherein R represents at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of rare earth elements<br>
including Y) and Bi may be an oxide or a compound that is<br>
converted into the oxide on heating, for example, a<br>
carbonate, a hydroxide and nitrate. While the average<br>
particle size of the raw material powder is not<br>
particularly limited, iron oxide is preferably in a form of<br>
fine powder, and more preferably has an average size of the<br>
primary particle of 1 µm or less, especially preferably 0.5<br>
µm or less. The raw material powder may further contain<br><br>
depending on necessity, in addition to the above-described<br>
components, B2O3 and other compounds, such as compounds<br>
containing Si, Al, Ga, In, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Ti, Zr,<br>
Ge, Sn, V, Nb, Ta, Sb, As, W and Mo, as well as unavoidable<br>
impurities.<br>
The calcination may be conducted in the air at a<br>
temperature of from 1,000 to 1,350°C for from 1 second to<br>
10 hours, particularly from 1 second to 3 hours.<br>
The resulting calcined body substantially has a<br>
magnetoplumbite ferrite structure, and the average particle<br>
size of the primary particle is preferably 2 µm or less,<br>
more preferably 1 pun or less, particularly preferably from<br>
0.1 to 1 µm, especially preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 µm. The<br>
average particle size can be measured by a scanning<br>
electron microscope.<br>
After pulverizing the calcined body, the sintered<br>
magnet is produced by adding one kind or a mixture of two<br>
or more kinds of compounds containing Fe, Sr or Ba, Co, R<br>
(wherein R represents at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of rare earth elements including Y)<br>
and Bi, and molded, followed by sintering. Specifically,<br>
it is preferably produced according to the following<br>
procedures. The addition amount of the compound powder is<br>
from 1 to 100% by volume of the calcined body, preferably<br>
from 5 to 70% by volume, and particularly from 10 to 50% by<br><br>
volume.<br>
The time at which the compounds are added is not<br>
particularly limited if it is after the calcining and<br>
before the sintering, but it is preferred to add on<br>
pulverizing described later. The kind and amount of the<br>
raw material powder to be added are arbitrary, and the same<br>
raw material may be added separately before and after the<br>
calcination, provided that 30% or more, preferably 50% or<br>
more of the total amount thereof is preferably added on a<br>
step after the calcination. The average powder size of the<br>
compound to be added is generally from 0.1 to 2 µm.<br>
In the invention, wet molding is conducted by using a<br>
slurry for molding containing oxide magnetic material<br>
powder, water as a dispersing medium, and a dispersant. In<br>
order to enhance the effect of the dispersant, a wet<br>
pulverizing step is provided before the wet molding step.<br>
In the case where the calcined material powder is used as<br>
the oxide magnetic material powder, since the calcined<br>
material powder is generally in a granule form, a dry<br>
coarse pulverizing step is preferably provided before the<br>
wet pulverizing step for coarse pulverization or<br>
deflocculation of the calcined material powder. In the<br>
case where the oxide magnetic material powder is produced<br>
by a coprecipitation method or a hydrothermal synthesis<br>
method, the dry coarse pulverizing step is generally not<br><br>
provided, and the wet pulverizing step is not necessary,<br>
but in order to further enhance the degree of orientation,<br>
it is preferred to conduct the wet pulverizing step. In<br>
the following, the case is described, in which the calcined<br>
material powder is used as the oxide magnetic material<br>
powder, and the dry coarse pulverizing step and the wet<br>
pulverizing step are conducted.<br>
In the dry coarse pulverizing step, pulverization is<br>
conducted until the BET specific surface area becomes 2<br>
times to 10 times the initial value. After pulverization,<br>
the average particle diameter is preferably about from 0.1<br>
to 1 µm, the BET specific surface area is preferably about<br>
from 4 to 10m2/g, and the CV [Coefficient of Variation = Deviation/Expected<br>
value] of the particle diameter is preferably maintained at 80% or less, more<br>
preferably from 10 to 70%. This means for pulverization is not particularly<br>
limited, and a dry vibration mill, a dry attritor (medium<br>
stirring mill) and a dry ball mill can be used. It is<br>
preferred to use a dry vibration mill. The pulverizing<br>
time is appropriately determined depending on the<br>
pulverizing means employed. It is preferred that a part of<br>
the raw material powder is added on the dry pulverizing<br>
step.<br>
The dry coarse pulverization also has a function of<br>
reducing the coercive force HcB by introducing crystal<br>
distortion to the calcined material powder. Agglomeration<br><br>
is suppressed by the reduction of the coercive force, and<br>
the dispersibility is improved. The soft magnetization<br>
improves the degree of orientation. The soft-magnetized<br>
particles are restored into the inherent hard magnetization<br>
through the subsequent sintering step to make a permanent<br>
magnet.<br>
On the dry pulverization, SiO2 and CaCO3 converted<br>
into CaO on heating are generally added. A part of SiO2<br>
and CaCO3 may be added before the calcination, and in that<br>
case, improvement in characteristics is observed.<br>
After the dry coarse pulverization, a slurry for<br>
pulverization containing the pulverized powder and water is<br>
prepared, and the wet pulverization is conducted using the<br>
same. The content of the calcined material powder in the<br>
slurry for pulverization is preferably about from 10 to 70%<br>
by weight. The means for pulverizing used in the wet<br>
pulverization is not particularly limited, a ball mill, an<br>
attritor and a vibration mill are generally preferably used.<br>
The pulverizing time is appropriately determined depending<br>
on the pulverizing means employed.<br>
After the wet pulverization, a slurry for molding is<br>
prepared by condensing the slurry for pulverization. The<br>
condensation can be conducted by centrifugation. The<br>
content of the calcined material powder in the slurry for<br>
molding is preferably about from 60 to 90% by weight.<br><br>
In the wet molding step, molding is conducted in the<br>
presence of a magnetic field by using the slurry for<br>
molding. The pressure for molding can be about from 0.1 to<br>
0.5 ton/cm2, and the applied magnetic field can be about<br>
from 5 to 15 kOe.<br>
The use of a non-aqueous dispersing medium in the<br>
slurry for molding is preferred since a high degree of<br>
orientation is obtained. In the invention, however, the<br>
slurry for molding using an aqueous dispersing medium<br>
containing a dispersant is employed. Examples of the<br>
dispersant that is preferably used in the invention include<br>
an organic compound having a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl<br>
group, its neutralized salt, its lactone, an organic<br>
compound having a hydroxymethylcarbonyl group, an organic<br>
compound having an enol type hydroxyl group that can be<br>
dissociated as an acid, and its neutralized salt.<br>
In the case where a non-aqueous dispersing medium is<br>
used, as described in e.g., US Patent Application Serial No.<br>
08/072,967, a surface active agent, such as oleic acid, is<br>
added to an organic solvent, such as toluene and xylene, to<br>
form a dispersing medium. By using such a dispersing<br>
medium, a high degree of magnetic orientation of 98% at the<br>
highest even when ferrite grains of a submicron size, which<br>
are hard to be dispersed, are employed.<br>
The above-described organic compounds have a carbon<br><br>
number of from 3 to 20, preferably from 4 to 12, in which<br>
hydroxyl groups are bonded to 50% or more of the carbon<br>
atoms except for the carbon atoms attached to oxygen atoms<br>
via a double bond. When the carbon number is 2 or less,<br>
the effect of the invention cannot be obtained. Even when<br>
the carbon number is 3 or more, if the ratio of carbon<br>
atoms, to which hydroxyl groups are attached, except for<br>
the carbon atoms attached to oxygen atoms via a double bond<br>
is less than 50%, the effect cannot be obtained. The ratio<br>
of the carbon atoms, to which hydroxyl groups are attached,<br>
is limited to the above-described organic compounds, and<br>
there is no limitation for the dispersants themselves. For<br>
example, when a lactone of an organic compound having a<br>
hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group (hydroxycarboxylic<br>
acid) is used as the dispersant, the ratio of the carbon<br>
atoms, to which hydroxyl groups are attached, is applied to<br>
the hydroxycarboxylic acid itself but not to the lactone.<br>
The basic skeleton of the above-described organic<br>
compounds may be a chainlike structure or a cyclic<br>
structure, and may be saturated or may contain an<br>
unsaturated bond.<br>
A hydroxycarboxylic acid and its neutralized salt or<br>
lactone are preferred as the dispersant. Particularly,<br>
gluconic acid (C=6, OH=5, COOH=1) and its neutralized salt<br>
or lactone, lactobionic acid (C=12, OH=8, COOH=1) and its<br><br>
neutralized salt or lactone, tartaric acid (C=4. OH=2,<br>
COOH=2) and its neutralized salt or lactone, and<br>
glucoheptonic acid y-lactone (C=7, OH=5) are preferred.<br>
Among these, gluconic acid and its neutralized salt or<br>
lactone are particularly preferred since they provide a<br>
high effect of improving the degree of orientation and are<br>
not expensive.<br>
Sorbose is preferred as the organic compound<br>
containing a hydroxymethylcabonyl group.<br>
Ascorbic acid is preferred as the organic compound<br>
having an enol type hydroxyl group that can be dissociated<br>
as an acid.<br>
In the invention, citric acid and its neutralized<br>
salt can be used as the dispersant. While citric acid has<br>
a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group, it does not satisfy<br>
the condition in that hydroxyl groups are bonded to 50% or<br>
more of the carbon atoms except for the carbon atoms<br>
attached to oxygen atoms via a double bond. However,<br>
citric acid provides an effect of improving the degree of<br>
orientation.<br>
The structures of a part of the preferred dispersants<br>
described above are shown below.<br><br><br><br><br>
The degree of orientation by the magnetic field<br>
orientation is influenced by the pH of the supernatant<br>
liquid of the slurry. Specifically, when the pH is too low.<br>
the degree of orientation is decreased, and the residual<br>
magnetic flux density after sintering is influenced<br>
therefrom. In the case where a compound exhibiting an<br>
acidic nature in an aqueous solution, such as<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid, is used as the dispersant, the pH<br>
of the supernatant liquid of the slurry becomes low.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that the pH of the supernatant<br>
liquid of the slurry is adjusted, for example, by adding a<br>
basic compound along with the dispersant. As the basic<br>
compound, ammonia and sodium hydroxide are preferred.<br>
Ammonia may be added as aqueous ammonia. The lowering of<br>
the pH can also be prevented by using a sodium salt of a<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
In the case where Si02 and CaC03 are added as<br>
auxiliary components as in a ferrite magnet, when a<br><br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid or its lactone is used as the<br>
dispersant, SiO2 and CaCO3 effuse along with the<br>
supernatant liquid of the slurry mainly on the preparation<br>
of the slurry for molding, and the desired performance<br>
cannot be obtained, for example. HcJ is decreased. When<br>
the pH is heightened by adding the basic compound, the<br>
effusing amount of SiO2 and CaCO3 becomes larger. On the<br>
other hand, the use of a calcium salt of a<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid can suppress the effusion of SiO2<br>
and CaCO3. By adding an excess amount of SiO2 and CaCO3 on<br>
adding the basic compound or on using the sodium salt as<br>
the dispersant, the shortage of the amounts of S102 and<br>
CaCO3 in the magnet can be prevented. When the ascorbic<br>
acid is used, there is substantially no effusion of SiO2<br>
and CaCO3.<br>
Because of the above-described reasons, the pH of the<br>
supernatant liquid of the slurry is preferably 7 or more,<br>
more preferably from 8 to 11.<br>
The kind of the neutralized salt used as the<br>
dispersant is not particularly limited, and may be any of a<br>
calcium salt, a sodium salt, etc. Because of the above-<br>
described reasons, a calcium salt is preferably used. When<br>
a sodium salt is used as the dispersant, or aqueous ammonia<br>
is added, a problem arises in that cracks are liable to be<br>
formed in the molded body or the sintered body, in addition<br><br>
to the effusion of the auxiliary components.<br>
The dispersant may be used in combination of two or<br>
more kinds thereof.<br>
The addition amount of the dispersant is preferably<br>
from 0.05 to 3.0% by weight, more preferably from 0.10 to<br>
2.0% by weight, based on the calcined material powder as<br>
the oxide magnetic material powder. When the amount of the<br>
dispersant is too small, the improvement in degree of<br>
orientation becomes insufficient. When the amount of the<br>
dispersant is too large, cracks are liable to be formed in<br>
the molded body and the sintered body.<br>
In the case where the dispersant is one that can be<br>
ionized in an aqueous solution, such as an acid or a<br>
metallic salt, the addition amount of the dispersant is the<br>
ion-converted value, i.e., the addition amount is obtained<br>
by converting to only the organic component except for a<br>
hydrogen ion and a metallic ion. In the case where the<br>
dispersant is a hydrate, the addition amount is obtained<br>
with excluding crystallization water. For example, when<br>
the dispersant is calcium gluconate monohydrate, the<br>
addition amount is obtained by converting into gluconic ion.<br>
In the case where the dispersant is a lactone or<br>
contains a lactone, the addition amount is obtained by<br>
converting into a hydroxycarboxylic ion with assuming that<br>
the whole lactone are split into a hydroxycarboxylic acid.<br><br>
The time at which the dispersant is added is not<br>
particularly limited. The dispersant may be added on the<br>
dry coarse pulverizing step or the preparation of the<br>
slurry for pulverization for the wet pulverizing step. A<br>
part of the dispersant may be added on the dry coarse<br>
pulverizing step and the balance may be added on the wet<br>
pulverizing step. Alternatively, it may be added after the<br>
wet pulverizing step with stirring. In any case, the<br>
dispersant is present in the slurry for molding, and thus<br>
the effect can be obtained. The addition on the<br>
pulverizing step, particularly on the dry coarse<br>
pulverizing step, provides higher effect of improving the<br>
degree of orientation. It is considered that this is<br>
because in the vibration mill used in the dry coarse<br>
pulverization, a larger energy is applied to the particles,<br>
and the temperature of the particle is increased, in<br>
comparison to the ball mill used in the wet pulverization,<br>
and thus the conditions in which chemical reactions are<br>
liable to occur is realized. It is considered that by<br>
adding the dispersant on the dry coarse pulverizing step,<br>
the amount of the dispersant adsorbed on the surface of the<br>
particles becomes larger, and consequently a higher degree<br>
of orientation can be obtained. When the residual amount<br>
of the dispersant in the slurry for molding (which is<br>
substantially the same as the adsorbed amount) is actually<br><br>
measured, the ratio of the residual amount to the addition<br>
amount becomes higher in the case where the dispersant is<br>
added on the dry coarse pulverizing step than the case<br>
where the dispersant is added on the wet pulverizing step.<br>
In the case where the addition of the dispersant is<br>
conducted by separating to plural addition operations, the<br>
addition amounts of each of the addition operations are<br>
determined in such a manner that the total addition amount<br>
is in the preferred range as described above.<br>
After the molding step, the molded body is heat<br>
treated in the air or nitrogen at a temperature of from 100<br>
to 500°C to sufficiently remove the dispersant added. The<br>
molded body is sintered in the subsequent sintering step,<br>
for example, in the air at a temperature of from 1,150 to<br>
1,250°C, preferably from 1,160 to 1,220°C, for about from<br>
0.5 to 3 hours, to obtain an anisotropic ferrite magnet.<br>
The average crystal grain diameter of the magnet of<br>
the invention is preferably 2 µm or less, more preferably 1<br>
µm or less, and especially preferably from 0.5 to 1.0 µm.<br>
Even if the average crystal grain diameter exceeds 1 µm in<br>
the invention, a sufficiently high coercive force can be<br>
obtained. The crystal grain diameter can be measured with<br>
a scanning electron microscope. The specific resistivity<br>
is about 10o Ωm or more.<br>
The sintered magnet can also be obtained in such a<br><br>
manner that the molded body is pulverized by using a<br>
crusher and classified to have the average grain diameter<br>
of about from 100 to 700 nm by a sieve to obtain a magnetic<br>
orientation granules, which is then subjected to a dry<br>
molding in the presence of a magnetic field, and the<br>
resulting molded body is sintered.<br>
The magnet powder can be obtained in such a manner<br>
that after the pulverization using the slurry of the<br>
calcined material, the slurry is dried and sintered.<br>
The invention involves a magnetic recording medium<br>
comprising a thin film magnetic layer. The thin film<br>
magnetic layer has a hexagonal magnetoplumbite ferrite<br>
phase as similar to the magnet powder of the invention.<br>
The content of impurities is equivalent to the above-<br>
described embodiments.<br>
The sputtering method is generally preferred for<br>
providing the thin film magnetic layer. In the case where<br>
the sputtering method is employed, the sintered magnet can<br>
be used as a target, or a multi-sputtering method using at<br>
least two kinds of targets may be employed. After the film<br>
formation by the sputtering method, it is generally<br>
subjected to a heat treatment to form the hexagonal<br>
magnetoplumbite structure.<br>
By using the magnet of the invention, the following<br>
effects can generally obtained and superior application<br><br>
products can be obtained. That is, in the case where the<br>
magnet of the invention has the same dimension as the<br>
conventional ferrite products, because the magnetic flux<br>
density generated from the magnet can be increased, it<br>
contributes to the provision of application products having<br>
higher performance, for example, a high torque can be<br>
obtained in the case of a motor, and a good sound quality<br>
with high linearity can be obtained due to the<br>
reinforcement of the magnetic circuit in the case of a<br>
speaker or a headphone. In the case where the same<br>
performance as the conventional magnet is enough, the size<br>
(thickness) of the magnet can be small (thin), and it<br>
contributes to make application products small-sized and<br>
lightweight (thin). Furthermore, in the motor using a<br>
wound type electromagnet as a magnet for a field system,<br>
the electromagnet can be replaced by the ferrite magnet to<br>
contribute to provision of the motor of lightweight and low<br>
cost, and the reduction in production process thereof.<br>
Furthermore, because the magnet of the invention is<br>
excellent in temperature characteristics of the coercive<br>
force (HcJ), it can be used under the low temperature<br>
conditions, under which the conventional ferrite magnet<br>
involves a danger of low temperature demagnetization<br>
(permanent demagnetization), and thus the reliability of<br>
products used in cold areas and areas highly above the sea<br><br>
level can be considerably increased.<br>
The magnet material of the invention is worked into<br>
prescribed shapes and is used in the wide range of<br>
applications described below.<br>
The magnet material of the invention can be<br>
preferably used as a motor for an automobile, such as for a<br>
fuel pump, a power window, an antilock brake system, a fan,<br>
a windshield wiper, a power steering, an active suspension<br>
system, a starter, a door lock system and an electric side<br>
mirror; a motor for an office automation and audio-visual<br>
apparatus, such as for an Floppy Disk Drive (FDD) spindle, a Video Tape<br>
Recorder (VTR) capstan, a VTR rotation head, a VTR reel, a VTR loading<br>
system, a comcorder capstan, a camcorder rotation head, a camcorder<br>
zooming system, a camcorder focusing system, a capstan for<br>
a combination tape recorder and radio, a spindle for a<br>
compact disk player, a laser disk player and a minidisk<br>
player, a loading system for a compact disk player, a laser<br>
disk player and a minidisk player, and an optical pickup<br>
for a compact disk player and a laser disk player; a motor<br>
for a home electric apparatus, such as for an air<br>
compressor for a air conditioner, a compressor for a<br>
refrigerator, driving an electric tool, an electric fan, a<br>
fan for a microwave oven, a rotation system for a plate of<br>
a microwave oven, driving a mixer, a fan for a hair dryer,<br>
driving a shaver and an electric toothbrush; a motor for a<br><br>
factory automation, such as for driving an axis and a joint<br>
of an industrial robot, a main driver of an industrial<br>
robot, driving a table of a working apparatus, and driving<br>
a belt of a working apparatus; and a motor for other<br>
applications, such as for a generator of a motor bike, a<br>
magnet for a speaker and a headphone, a magnetron tube, a<br>
magnetic field generator for an MRI system, a clamper for a<br>
CD-ROM, a sensor of a distributor, a sensor of an antilock<br>
brake system, a level sensor for a fuel and an oil, and a<br>
magnet clutch.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Sintered magnet of Sample Nos. 1 and 2 were prepared<br>
by using an aqueous system with the additive compounds<br>
added after calcination.<br>
As raw materials, the following materials were used.<br>
Fe2O3 powder (primary particle size: 0.3 µm 1,000.0 g<br>
(containing Mn. Cr, Si and C1 as impurities)<br>
SrC03 powder (primary particle size: 2 µm)	161.2 g<br>
(containing Ba and Ca as impurities)<br>
As additives, the following materials were used.<br>
SiO2 powder (primary particle size: 0.01 µm	2.30 g<br>
CaCO3 powder (primary particle size: 1 µm)	1.72 g<br><br>
The raw materials and the additives were pulverized<br>
in a wet attritor, followed by drying and rectification of<br>
granules, and baked in the air at 1,250°C for 3 hours, to<br>
obtain a calcined material in the form of granules.<br>
To the resulting calcined material, SiO2, CaCO3,<br>
lanthanum carbonate (La2(CO3)3.8H2O) and cobalt oxide (CoO)<br>
were added in the amounts shown in Table 1, and calcium<br>
gluconate was further added in the amount shown in Table 1,<br>
followed by dry coarse pulverization for 20 minutes by a<br>
batch vibration rod mill. At this time, distortion due to<br>
pulverization was introduced, and the HcJ of the calcined<br>
material grains was lowered to 1.7 kOe.<br>
Next. 177 g of the coarse pulverized material<br>
produced in the same manner as above was collected, and<br>
37.25 g of the same iron oxide (a-Fe2O3) was added thereto,<br>
and 400 cc of water was further added thereto as a<br>
dispersing medium, to prepare a slurry for pulverization.<br>
By using the slurry for pulverization, wet<br>
pulverization was conducted in a ball mill for 40 hours.<br>
The specific surface area after the wet pulverization was<br>
8.5 m2/g (average grain diameter: 0.5 µm . The pH of the<br>
supernatant liquid of the slurry after the wet<br>
pulverization was 9.5.<br>
After the wet pulverization, the slurry for<br><br>
pulverization was subjected to centrifugation to adjust the<br>
concentration of the calcined material in the slurry to 78%,<br>
so as to prepare a slurry for molding. Compression molding<br>
was conducted by using the slurry for molding with removing<br>
water from the slurry. The molding was conducted while<br>
applying a magnetic field in the direction of compression<br>
of about 13 kOe. The resulting molded body had a<br>
cylindrical shape having a diameter of 30 mm and a height<br>
of 18 mm. The molding pressure was 0.4 ton/cm2. A part of<br>
the slurry was dried and fired at 1,000°C to convert the<br>
whole contents thereof to oxides, and it was subjected to<br>
the fluorescent X-ray quantitative analysis to obtain the<br>
contents of the components. The results obtained are shown<br>
in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
The molded body was subjected to a heat treatment at<br>
a temperature of from 100 to 300°C to sufficiently remove<br>
gluconic acid, and then sintered in the air with a<br>
temperature increasing rate of 5°C/min, followed by<br>
maintained at 1,220°C for 1 hour, to obtain a sintered body.<br>
The upper and lower surfaces of the resulting sintered body<br>
were worked, and was measured for the residual magnetic<br>
flux density (Br), the coercive force (HeJ and Hcb), the<br>
maximum energy product ((BH)max), the saturation<br>
magnetization (4ΠIS), the degree of magnetic orientation<br>
(Ir/Is), and the squareness (Hk/HcJ). The sample was then<br><br>
worked into a shape of 5 mm in diameter and 6.5 mm in<br>
height. The Curie temperature Tc was obtained by measuring<br>
the temperature dependency of the magnetization in the c<br>
axis by VSM. The results obtained are shown in Figures 5<br>
and 6. The SEM photographs of the structures in a. axis and<br>
C axis of the samples are shown in Figures 1 and 2. It is<br>
clear from Figures 5 and 6 that Sample Nos. 1 and 2 of the<br>
invention each has two Curie temperatures of 440°C and 456°<br>
C for Sample No. 1 and 434°C and 454°C for Sample No. 2. It<br>
is considered therefrom that the crystal grains of the<br>
samples of the invention have a two-phase structure in<br>
which the phases have magnetic characteristics different<br>
from each other. The samples were subjected to X-ray<br>
diffractiometry, and as a result the samples were of a<br>
monophase of an M type ferrite. No great difference in<br>
lattice index therebetween.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
Sintered magnet of Sample No. 3 was prepared by using<br>
an aqueous system with the additive compounds added before<br>
calcination.<br>
As raw materials, the following materials were used.<br>
Fe2O3 powder (primary particle size: 0.3 µm	1,000.0 g<br>
(containing Mn, Cr, Si and C1 as impurities)<br>
SrCO3 powder (primary particle size: 2 µm	130.3 g<br><br>
(containing Ba and Ca as impurities)<br>
Cobalt oxide	17.56 g<br>
La2O3	35.67 g<br>
As additives, the following materials were used.<br>
SiO2 powder (primary particle size: 0.01 nm) 2.30 g<br>
CaCO3 powder (primary particle size: 1 pun)	1.72 g<br>
The raw materials and the additives were pulverized<br>
in a wet attritor, followed by drying and rectification of<br>
granules, and baked in the air at 1,250°C for 3 hours, to<br>
obtain a calcined material in the form of granules. The<br>
magnetic characteristics of the resulting calcined material<br>
were measured with a vibration sample magnetomator (VSM),<br>
and as a result, the saturation magnetization as was 68<br>
emu/g and the coercive force HcJ was 4.6 kOe.<br>
To the resulting calcined material, SiO2 and CaCO3<br>
were added in the amounts shown in Table 1, and calcium<br>
gluconate was further added in the amount shown in Table 1,<br>
followed by dry coarse pulverization for 20 minutes by a<br>
batch vibration rod mill. At this time, distortion due to<br>
pulverization was Introduced, and the HcJ of the calcined<br>
material grains was lowered to 1.7 kOe.<br>
Next, 210 g of the coarse pulverized material thus-<br><br>
produced was collected, and 400 cc of water was further<br>
added thereto as a dispersing medium, to prepare a slurry<br>
for pulverization.<br>
By using the slurry for pulverization, wet<br>
pulverization was conducted in a ball mill for 40 hours.<br>
The specific surface area after the wet pulverization was<br>
8.5 m2/g (average particle diameter: 0.5 µm) . The pH of<br>
the supernatant liquid of the slurry after the wet<br>
pulverization was from 9 to 10.<br>
After the wet pulverization, the slurry for<br>
pulverization was subjected to centrifugation to adjust the<br>
concentration of the calcined material in the slurry to 78%,<br>
so as to prepare a slurry for molding. Compression molding<br>
was conducted by using the slurry for molding with removing<br>
water from the slurry. The molding was conducted while<br>
applying a magnetic field in the direction of compression<br>
of about 13 kOe. The resulting molded body had a<br>
cylindrical shape having a diameter of 30 mm and a height<br>
of 18 mm. The molding pressure was 0.4 ton/cm2. A part of<br>
the slurry was dried and fired at 1,000°C to convert the<br>
whole contents thereof to oxides, and it was subjected to<br>
the fluorescent X-ray quantitative analysis to obtain the<br>
contents of the components. The results obtained are shown<br>
in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
The molded body was subjected to a heat treatment at<br><br>
a temperature of from 100 to 360°C to sufficiently remove<br>
gluconic acid, and then sintered in the air with a<br>
temperature increasing rate of 5°C/min, followed by<br>
maintained at 1.220°C for 1 hour, to obtain a sintered body.<br>
The upper and lower surfaces of the resulting sintered body<br>
were worked, and was measured for the residual magnetic<br>
flux density (Br), the coercive force (HeJ and Hcb), the<br>
maximum energy product ((BH)max), the saturation<br>
magnetization (4ΠIS), the degree of magnetic orientation<br>
(Ir/Is), and the squareness (Hk/HcJ). The results are<br>
shown in Table 4. The sample was then worked into a shape<br>
of 5 mm in diameter and 6.5 mm in height. The Curie<br>
temperature Tc was obtained by measuring the temperature<br>
dependency of the magnetization in the c axis by VSM. The<br>
results obtained are shown in Figure 7. It is clear from<br>
Figure 7 that the sample has one Curie temperature of 444°C.<br>
The specific resistivity in the a axis direction and<br>
the c axis direction of the sintered body samples Nos. 1 to<br>
3 were measured. The results are shown in Table 5. The<br>
SEM photographs of the structures observed from the a. axis<br>
direction and the c. axis direction for the samples were<br>
shown in Figures 3 and 4. It is clear from Figures 1 to 4<br>
that the ferrite of the invention has a larger grain size<br>
in comparison to the conventional ferrite shown in Figures<br>
3 and 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is clear from Table 4 that the cores of the<br>
sintered bodies within the scope of the invention exhibited<br>
extremely excellent characteristics.<br>
It is clear from Table 5 that Sample Nos. 1 and 2 of<br>
the invention obtained by the process of addition after the<br>
calcination exhibited smaller specific resistivities of<br>
1/10 to 1/100 of that of the comparative sample obtained by<br>
the process of addition before the calcination. It is<br>
considered therefrom that the sample obtained by the<br>
process of addition before the calcination and the samples<br>
obtained by the process of addition after the calcination<br>
are different in fine structures of the sintered bodies.<br>
Among the samples according to the invention. Sample No. 2<br>
having the La-rich composition exhibited a smaller value of<br>
1/4 to 1/2 of that of Sample No. 1. In all the samples,<br>
the values of the a axis direction were smaller than the<br>
values of the c axis direction.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A comparison was made for the addition of Fe, La and<br>
Co after the calcination.<br>
The composition as in Example 1 (SrFe12O19 + SiO2:<br>
0.2% by weight + CaCO3: 0.15% by weight) was calcined in<br>
the same manner as in Example 1, to obtain a calcined<br>
material. To the resulting calcined material in the form<br>
of granules, La2(CO3)3.8H20, CoOx(CoO+Co3O4) , the iron oxide<br><br>
(-Fe2O3) and SiO2 (0.4% by weight), which were the same as<br>
those used as the raw materials, CaCO3 (1.25% by weight),<br>
and calcium gluconate (0.6% by weight) were added in such a<br>
manner that the composition after the addition became the<br>
following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-xCoxO19<br>
wherein x = y = 0, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3, followed by subjecting<br>
to the coarse pulverization using a small-sized vibration<br>
mill. The composition was then subjected to the wet<br>
pulverization in the same manner as in Example 1 for 40<br>
hours, followed by baking. Separately, a sample wherein no<br>
calcium gluconate was used but only water was used, and a<br>
sample wherein xylene was used as the dispersing medium and<br>
oleic acid was used as the dispersant were prepared.<br>
The degrees of orientation of the molded bodies<br>
depending on the addition amounts of La and Co for the<br>
sintered body samples are shown in Figure 8, and the HcJ-Br<br>
characteristics thereof are shown in Figure 9. The<br>
addition amounts of Fe, La and Co after the calcination<br>
were expressed by x, with the composition after the<br>
addition being represented by the following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-xCOx019<br><br>
In the case where calcium gluconate was used as the aqueous<br>
dlspersant, the clear increase in degree of orientation was<br>
observed with the increase in the addition amount after the<br>
calcination, and in the case of x (substitution degree) of<br>
0.4, it was closed to the value obtained when xylene was<br>
used as the non-aqueous solvent and oleic acid was used as<br>
the surface active agent. On the other hand, no<br>
improvement in degree of orientation was observed when no<br>
gluconic acid was added to water. With respect to the<br>
characteristics of the sintered bodies, in many cases,<br>
Hk/Hcj &gt; 90%, and it was the maximum that x = 0.2. When<br>
the addition amount became large (x &gt; 0.3), the moldability<br>
was lowered.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A comparison was made for the addition of Fe before<br>
the calcination, and La and Co after the calcination, and<br>
was also made for the calcination temperatures.<br>
To the composition as in Example 1 (SrFe12O19 + SiO2:<br>
0.2% by weight + CaCO3: 0.15% by weight), the iron oxide (<br>
-Fe2O3), which was the same as that used as the raw<br>
material was added, in such a manner that the composition<br>
was represented by the following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-yCoyO19<br><br>
wherein x = y = 0.2, and calcined materials were obtained<br>
in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the<br>
composition was calcined at 1,150°C, 1,200°C, 1,250°C and<br>
1,300°C. The resulting calcined material samples were<br>
subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis, and the presence<br>
of the M phase and the hematite phase (α-Fe2O3) was<br>
observed. The as value of the Sr M phase in the calcined<br>
powder was then calculated under the assumption that in the<br>
calcined material obtained by the process where Fe was<br>
added before the calcination, the whole incremental amount<br>
of Fe was converted into the α-Fe2O3 phase, and the balance<br>
became the Sr M phase. As a result, it was substantially<br>
equal to the as value of the Sr M calcined material at the<br>
same calcination temperature, and therefore it was<br>
considered that the assumption was reasonable.<br>
To the resulting calcined material in the form of<br>
granules, La2(CO3)38H2O, CoOx(CoO+Co3O4) + SiO2 (0.4% by<br>
weight), CaCO3 (1.25% by weight), and calcium gluconate<br>
(0.6% by weight) were added in such a manner that the<br>
composition was represented by the following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-yCOyO19<br>
wherein x = y = 0.2, followed by subjecting to coarse<br><br>
pulverization using a small-sized vibration mill. The<br>
composition was then subjected to the wet pulverization in<br>
the same manner as in Example 1 for 40 hours, followed by<br>
baking.<br>
The resulting molded body was measured for the degree<br>
of orientation. The results obtained are shown in Figure<br>
10. It is clear for Figure 10 that the degree of<br>
orientation of molded body was high in the sample using the<br>
calcined body at 1,250°C, which was equivalent to the<br>
sample obtained by the process where all the additives were<br>
added after the calcination. Figure 11 shows the<br>
relationship between the sintered density and the degrees<br>
of magnetic orientation (Ir/Is) at a calcination<br>
temperature of 1,250°C. Although the degrees of<br>
orientation of the molded body were the same, the sample<br>
obtained by the process where only a-Fe203 was added before<br>
the calcination had the higher density and the higher<br>
degree of orientation. Figure 12 shows HcJ-Br and Hk/HcJ<br>
at a calcination temperature of 1,250°C. In the sample<br>
obtained by the process where only ct-Fe203 was added before<br>
the calcination. HcJ was lowered but Br was high due to the<br>
high density and degree of orientation, which was in the<br>
same level of characteristics as the sample of Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A comparison was made for the addition of Fe and La<br><br>
before the calcination, and only Co after the calcination.<br>
To the composition as in Example 1 (SrFe12019 + SiO2:<br>
0.2% by weight + CaCO3: 0.15% by weight), the iron oxide (a<br>
-Fe2O3), which was the same as that used as the raw<br>
material, and La2O3 were added in such a manner that the<br>
composition was represented by the following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-yCoyO19<br>
wherein x = y = 0.2, and calcined materials were obtained<br>
in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the<br>
composition was calcined at 1,200°C or 1,250°C. The<br>
resulting calcined material samples were subjected to X-ray<br>
diffraction analysis, and the presence of the M phase and<br>
the hematite phase (α-Fe2O3) was observed. A peak of ortho-<br>
ferrite (FeLaO3) was not confirmed.<br>
To the resulting calcined material in the form of<br>
granules, CoOx(CoO+Co3O4) + SiO2 (0.4% by weight), CaCO3<br>
(1.25% by weight), and calcium gluconate (0.6% by weight)<br>
were added in such a manner that the composition was<br>
represented by the following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-yCOyO19<br>
wherein x = y = 0.2, followed by subjecting to coarse<br><br>
pulverization using a small-sized vibration mill. The<br>
composition was then subjected to the wet pulverization in<br>
the same manner as in Example 1 for 40 hours, followed by-<br>
baking in the same manner as in Example 1.<br>
Hcj-Br and Hk/HcJ are shown in Table 6.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
A comparison was made for the addition of Fe and La<br>
before the calcination, and only Co after the calcination.<br>
To the composition as in Example 1 (SrFe12O19 + SiO2:<br>
0.2% by weight + CaCO3: 0.15% by weight), La2(CO3). 8H2O was<br>
added in such a manner that the composition after the<br>
addition was represented by the following formula:<br>
Sr1-xLaxFe12-yCOy019<br>
wherein x = y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4, to obtain calcined<br><br>
powder (solvent system with addition before the<br>
calcination). Separately, La2(CO3)3.8H2O was added after<br>
the calcination in such a manner that the composition after<br>
the addition was represented by the above formula wherein x<br>
= y = 0, 0.1. 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4, to obtain calcined powder<br>
(solvent system with addition after the calcination).<br>
Oleic acid was added to these species of calcined powder,<br>
followed by coarse pulverization by using a small-sized<br>
vibration mill. The solvent pulverization was then<br>
conducted for 40 hours, followed by baking, to obtain<br>
samples.<br>
The squareness Hk/HcJ of the resulting sintered body<br>
sample obtained at 1,220°C is shown in Figure 13, and the<br>
degree of magnetic orientation depending on the addition<br>
amounts (Ir/Is) is shown in Figure 14. The degrees of<br>
orientation of the samples were in the same level, and<br>
Hk/HcJ of the sample of the addition after the calcination<br>
was improved in comparison to the another.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Investigation was made for the separate addition of<br>
La and Co.<br>
As raw materials, the following materials were used.<br>
Fe2O3 powder (primary grain size: 0.3 µm) 1,000.0 g<br>
SrCO3 powder (primary grain size: 2 µm	161.2 g<br><br>
These raw materials were pulverized in a wet attrltor,<br>
followed by drying and rectification of granules, and baked<br>
in the air at 1,250°C for 3 hours, to obtain a calcined<br>
material in the form of granules.<br>
To the resulting calcined material, SiO2 = 0.6% by<br>
weight, CaCO3 = 1.4% by weight, lanthanum carbonate<br>
(La2(CO3)3.8H20), cobalt oxide (CoO), and calcium gluconate<br>
(0.9% by weight) were added on the pulverization by a dry<br>
vibration mill. At this time, the La/Co ratio was changed<br>
by changing the addition amount of La. Iron oxide (Fe203)<br>
was added on the pulverization by a ball mill. Separately,<br>
as the calcined material (referred to as mother material in<br>
the Table), those of the addition amounts of lanthanum<br>
carbonate (La2(CO3)3.8H2O) and cobalt oxide (CoO) before the<br>
calcination x = 0 or 0.1 were prepared. The compositions<br>
of the samples and the results of analysis of the<br>
pulverized materials are shown in Table 7.<br><br><br><br>
The resulting samples were baked at 1,200°C, 1,220°C<br>
and 1,240°C, and measured for magnetic characteristics.<br>
The results obtained are shown in Figure 15. In all the<br>
samples, a relatively high HcJ and Hk values were obtained<br>
in the case of the La-rich composition (La/Co = 1.14 to<br>
1.23). As a comparison was made at the optimum point of<br>
La/Co, in the case of the addition of x = 0.1 after the<br>
calcination to the mother material of x = 0.1, Hk had a<br>
tendency of deteriorated, and in the case of the addition<br>
of x = 0.2 after the calcination to the mother material of<br>
x = 0, high sintered magnetic characteristics were obtained.<br>
It has been known that the addition of La and Co on<br>
pulverization (after the calcination) provides a higher Hk<br>
than the case of the addition to the raw material (before<br>
the calcination). In this example, the intermediate<br>
behavior was observed between these two cases, and no<br>
characteristic result was obtained.<br>
While the ferrites containing Sr have been considered<br>
in the foregoing examples, it has been confirmed that the<br>
equivalent results have been obtained for ferrites<br>
containing Ba.<br>
The shape of the samples of the invention obtained in<br>
the foregoing examples was changed from the cylindrical<br>
form to a shape of a filed magnet of a C type motor, to<br>
produce a sintered magnet having a shape of a C type motor.<br><br>
The resulting core materials were installed in a motor to<br>
replace the sintered magnet of the conventional material.<br>
The motor was operated at the rated conditions, and thus<br>
good characteristics were exhibited. The torque of the<br>
motor was observed, and thus the torque was increased in<br>
comparison to the motor using the conventional core<br>
material. The same results were obtained by using a bonded<br>
magnet.<br>
The effect of the invention is clear from the<br>
foregoing examples.<br><br>
