3.      PREAMBLE OF THE DESCRIPTION:-<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing ethylene from ethanol, more particular, to a process for producing ethylene from ethanol combining the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The global petroleum supply-demand contradiction is increasingly prominent at the beginning of the 21st century. Along with the increased demand for various petroleum and petrochemical products, the price of crude oil in the market is continuously increased. This situation leads to persisting high market-prices of important chemical products such as light olefins (especially ethylene and propylene) and light ethers (such as dimethyl ether, ethyl ether, etc), using petroleum and petrochemical products as feedstock. Therefore, it is one choice of solving these problems to seek for another substituting feedstock such as by-product ethanol from agriculture and forestry, and methanol prepared from natural gas or coal to produce light olefins and light ethers.<br>
The process for preparing ethylene from ethanol is to carry out the dehydration reaction CH3CH2OH -&gt; CH2=CH2 + H20 at I40-400Â°C with a suitable catalyst. At the beginning of 1980's, India and Brazil built up industry-scale devices for converting ethanol to ethylene, using Si02-Al203 as catalyst and adopting fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors altogether. For the balance of heat, an additional fuel will be added when the catalyst is regenerated.<br>
The process disclosed in US 6,441,261 is to convert oxygenates (methanol, etc) to light olefins, e.g. ethylene and propylene, on a silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve catalyst under a relative high pressure.<br>
US 6,303,839 and US 5,914,433 convert oxygenates (methanol, etc) to light olefins and fractionate out the propylene and/or butene therein for cracking, thereby enhancing the yield of ethylene and propylene. Although the above processes also use fluidized bed operation, it is seen from the data of the examples that the yield of coke is only 2%. With a low yield of coke, the heat of the system is difficult to be balanced, and an external heat supply is generally needed.<br>
US 6,049,017 increases the yield of light olefins by separating the product containing C4 components and converting them to ethylene and propylene on a non-molecular sieve catalyst. This process may be used in the catalytic cracking or the methanol dehydration for producing ethylene and propylene.<br>
2<br><br>
US 4,148,835 uses a shape-selective molecular sieve catalyst and derivatives thereof to convert alcohols (especially methanol) to a product mainly containing light olefins, but this patent does not mention of the process.<br>
The ethanol dehydration reaction is an endothermic reaction, and is conducted at a certain temperature. Although coke deposition may occur during the reaction, the amount of the coke is insufficient to balance the heat of the process. In summary, all the prior arts provide the heat in a manner of supplying an external fuel, making the process too complicated or the energy consumption too high.<br>

5<br><br>
from a portion of regenerated catalyst is used to preheat the air entering the regenerator. The direct heat exchanger is in a type of fluidized bed or riser, and the cooled catalyst separated by a cyclone separator enters the catalytic conversion reactor of ethanol after stripping off the gas impurities (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and the like) with the hot steam. The indirect heat exchange mode is to use an indirect heat exchanger, wherein the hot catalyst passes through the tube side and the steam passes through the shell side.<br>
The process for producing ethylene from ethanol combining the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons according to the present invention, not only reasonably utilizes the excessive thermal energy of the hydrocarbon conversion, but also solves the problem of heat supply for the conversion of ethanol, thus ensuring the continuous catalytic conversion of ethanol and generating enormous economic benefits. For the catalytic conversion of the ethanol, the content of ethylene is 95 vol% or more in the gas product; and the conversion of ethylene is not less than 99%. For the catalytic conversion of the hydrocarbons, the yield for the light olefins increases slightly by at least 2 mol%.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention will be further illustrated in reference to the drawing, but the present invention is not limit thereto.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic flowsheet of the process for producing ethylene from ethanol combining the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An ethanol feedstock from line 1 is introduced into the reactor 2 and contacted with a Y-zeolite containing regenerated catalyst from line 14 to react at 200-450Â°C, under a pressure (gauge) of 0-0.8MPa, at a weight ratio of the catalyst to ethanol feedstock of 0.05-20, with a weight hourly space velocity of 0.1-10 h"'. A coked catalyst and a product stream are obtained after separating the reaction stream. The product stream is withdrawn through the line 3 and further separated to give the target product of ethylene. The coked catalyst may be partially or completely introduced into the regenerator 5 through the line 4 for the coke-burning regeneration, and a portion of the coked catalyst may return to the reactor 2 sequentially through the lines 15 and 14 or return to the reactor 7 sequentially through the lines 17 and 10.<br>
6<br><br>
The hydrocarbon feedstock from line 6 is introduced into the reactor 7 and contacted with a Y-zeolite containing regenerated catalyst from the line 10 to react at 400-700Â°C, under a pressure (gauge) of 0-0.8MPa, at a weight ratio of the catalyst to the hydrocarbon feedstock of 1-30, with a contact time of 1-10 s. A spent catalyst and an oil vapor are obtained after separating the reaction stream, wherein the oil vapor is withdrawn through the line 8 and further separated to give the products such as gas, gasoline, diesel oil and the like (not shown in the figure). After stripping, the spent catalyst is completely or partially introduced into the regenerator 5 through the line 9 for the coke-burning regeneration, and a portion of the spent catalyst may return to the reactor 2 sequentially through the lines 16 and 14.<br>
The weight ratio of the coked catalyst and the spent catalyst entering the regenerator 5 for the coke-burning regeneration is no more than 1.0, preferably no more than 0.5, more preferably no more than 0,2. The regenerated catalyst, which is coke-burning regenerated in the regenerator 5, is divided into two portions, wherein one portion returns to the reactor 7 through line 10, and the other portion sequentially enters the heat exchanger 13 through the line 12, cools therein, and then returns to the reactor 2 through the line 14.<br>
The process of the present invention will further be illustrated by the following examples, but the present invention is not limit thereto.<br>
Example 1<br>
The ethanol feedstock and hydrocarbon feedstock used in this example were an ethanol feedstock containing 95% ethanol brewed from grains and vacuum gas oil (VGO), respectively, and the properties of VGO are shown in Table 1. The catalyst used in this example was CGP-1 (containing 25 wt% of REY-zeoIite, 10 wt% of ZSP-zeoIite, and the balanced support, all based on the total weight of the catalyst) produced by SINOPEC Catalyst Company Qilu Division.<br>
The ethanol feedstock was introduced into a fluidized bed reactor and contacted with the CGP-1 catalyst to react at 340Â°C. under a pressure (gauge) of 0.1 MPa, at a weight ratio of the catalyst to the ethanol feedstock (catalyst/alcohol ratio) of 1, with a weight hourly space velocity of 1.0 h' .A coked catalyst and a product stream were obtained after separating the product stream. The product stream was further separated to give the target product of ethylene. The product distribution is shown in Table 2. The coked catalyst was divided into two portions, wherein 20 wt% of the coked catalyst was introduced into the regenerator for the coke-burning regeneration, and the remaining 80 wt% of the coked catalyst retuned to the fluidized bed reactor through the inner recycle.<br>
7<br><br>
The preheated VGO was injected into a riser reactor after the steam atomization at a weight ratio of the steam to VGO was 0.1:1. VGO was contacted with the hot CGP-1 catalyst in the riser to react at 500Â°C, under a pressure (gauge) of 0.1 MPa, at a weight ratio of the catalyst to VGO (catalyst/oil ratio) of 6, with a reaction time of 3 seconds. The mixture of the oil vapor and the catalyst rose along the riser to the outlet of the riser. The reaction product and the spent catalyst were separated. The reaction product was introduced into the settler and then into the subsequent separation system to further separate into various products. The product distribution is shown in Table 2. The spent catalyst entered the stripper under the action of gravity to strip with the steam, and it was then introduced into the regenerator for the coke-burning regeneration.<br>
20 wt% of the coked catalyst and all the spent catalyst were regenerated in the regenerator, wherein the weight ratio of the coked catalyst and the spent catalyst entering the regenerator for the coke-burning regeneration is about 0.02. After the regeneration, the regenerated catalyst were divided into two portions, wherein 85 wt% of the regenerated catalyst, having a temperature of 660Â°C, retuned to the riser for the recycling use, and the remaining 15 wt% of the regenerated catalyst was cooled down to 410Â°C and retuned to the fluidized bed for the recycling use.<br>
The testing results demonstrated that by combining the catalytic conversion of ethanol and the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons, the heat between the two conversions can be balanced, and there is no need for the external ruel or other heat sources. For the catalytic conversion of the ethanol, the content of ethylene is as high as 95.79 vol% in the gas product; and the conversion of ethylene is as high as 99%.<br>
Further, the inventors also found that:<br>
(1)	The catalytic conversion of ethanol had not any effect on the crystalline phase of the catalyst CGP-1; and in comparison of the catalyst's acidity prior to the catalytic conversion, the catalyst's acidity decreased slightly after the catalytic conversion; and<br>
(2)	For the catalytic conversion of the hydrocarbons, the yield for the light products increases slightly by 2 mol% by combining the catalytic conversion of ethanol and the catalytic conversion of the hydrocarbons, the reason for which is believed that the catalyst's acidity is decreased.<br>
Example 2<br>
In this example, the ethanol feedstock is identical to that of Example 1; and the hydrocarbon feedstock is an atmospheric residuum. The properties of the atmospheric residuum are shown in Table 1. The catalyst used in this example was MMC-2 (containing 10<br>
8<br><br>
wt% of USY-zeolite, 20 wt% of ZSM-5 zeolite, and the balanced support, all based on the total weight of the catalyst) produced by SINOPEC Catalyst Company Qilu Division.<br>
The ethanol feedstock was introduced into a fluidized bed reactor and contacted with the MMC-2 catalyst to react at 360Â°C, under a pressure (gauge) of 0.1 MPa, at a weight ratio of the catalyst to the ethanol feedstock (catalyst/alcohol ratio) of 5, with a weight hourly space velocity of 1.5 h"1. A coked catalyst and a product stream were obtained after separating the reaction stream. The product stream was further separated to give the target product of ethylene. The product distribution is shown in Table 2. The coked catalyst was divided into two portions, wherein 30 wt% of the coked catalyst was introduced into the regenerator for the coke-burning regeneration, and the remaining 70 wt% of the coked catalyst retuned to the fluidized bed reactor through the inner recycle.<br>
The preheated atmospheric residuum was injected into a riser reactor after the steam atomization at a weight ratio of the steam to the atmospheric residuum was 0.1:1. The atmospheric residuum was contacted with the hot MMC-2 catalyst in the riser to react at 550Â°C, under a pressure (gauge) of 0.1 MPa, at a weight ratio of the catalyst to the atmospheric residuum (catalyst/oil ratio) of 8, with a reaction time of 4 seconds. The mixture of the oil vapor and the catalyst rose along the riser to the outlet of the riser. The reaction product and the spent catalyst were separated. The reaction product was introduced into the settler and then into the subsequent separation system to further separate into various products. The product distribution is shown in Table 2. The spent catalyst entered the stripper under the action of gravity to strip with the steam, and it was then introduced into the regenerator for the coke-burning regeneration.<br>
30 wt% of the coked catalyst and all the spent catalyst were regenerated in the regenerator, wherein the weight ratio of the coked catalyst and the spent catalyst entering the regenerator for the coke-burning regeneration is about 0.02. After the regeneration, the regenerated catalyst were divided into two portions, wherein 80 wt% of the regenerated catalyst, having a temperature of 680Â°C, retuned to the riser for the recycling use, and the remaining 20 wt% of the regenerated catalyst was cooled down to 410Â°C and retuned to the fluidized bed for the recycling use.<br>
The testing results demonstrated that by combining the catalytic conversion of ethanol and the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons, the heat between the two conversions can be balanced, and there is no need for the external fuel or other heat sources. For the catalytic conversion of the ethanol, the content of ethylene is as high as 98.3 vol% in the gas product; and the conversion of ethylene is as high as 99.1%.<br>
Further, the inventors also found that:<br>
9<br><br>
(1)	The catalytic conversion of ethanol had not any effect on the crystalline phase of the catalyst MMC-2; and in comparison of the catalyst's acidity prior to the catalytic conversion, the catalyst's acidity decreased slightly after the catalytic conversion; and<br>
(2)	For the catalytic conversion of the hydrocarbons, the yield for the light products increases slightly by 2 mol% by combining the catalytic conversion of ethanol and the catalytic conversion of the hydrocarbons, the reason for which is believed that the catalyst's acidity is decreased.<br>
