				<td>TRANSPARENT SUBSTRATE THAT CAN BE USED, ALTERNATIVELY OR<br>
CUMULATIVELY, FOR THERMAL CONTROL, FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC<br>
SHIELDING AND FOR HEATED WINDOWS<br>
The present invention relates to the field of glazing that can be used<br>
alternatively or cumulatively in three particular applications, namely thermal control<br>
(solar control and thermal insulation), electromagnetic shielding and heated windows,<br>
while still preferably being able to undergo at least one transformation operation<br>
involving a heat treatment at a temperature of at least 500°C (this may be in particular a<br>
toughening, annealing or bending operation).<br>
Thermal control is the possibility of acting on solar radiation and/or long-<br>
wavelength infrared radiation passing through glazing that separates an outdoor<br>
environment from an indoor environment, either for outward reflection of the solar<br>
radiation ("solar control" glazing) or for inward reflection of the infrared radiation of<br>
wavelength greater than 5 µm (thermal insulation with glazing called in particular "low-<br>
emissivity glazing").<br>
Electromagnetic shielding is the possibility of eliminating, or at the very least<br>
reducing, the propagation of electromagnetic waves through glazing. This possibility is<br>
often combined with the possibility of acting on the infrared radiation passing through<br>
the glazing. This application is advantageous in the electronics field, especially for the<br>
production of electromagnetically shielded windows, also called "electromagnetic<br>
filters", which are intended for example to be placed on the faceplate of a display screen<br>
using plasma technology.<br>
A heated window is a window whose temperature may rise when it is<br>
subjected to an electrical current. This type of window has applications in automobiles,<br>
or even in buildings, for the production of glass panes that prevent the formation, or that<br>
eliminate, ice or misting, or else that suppress the sensation of a cold wall near the<br>
glazing.<br>
The present invention relates more particularly to a transparent substrate,<br>
especially made of glass, which is provided with a thin-film stack comprising a plurality<br>
of functional layers, said substrate being able to be used, alternatively, or cumulatively,<br>
for thermal control, electromagnetic shielding and heated windows.<br><br>
It is known to produce thin-film stacks to achieve thermal control, more<br>
precisely solar control, which are capable of simultaneously preserving their thermal<br>
properties and their optical properties after heat treatment, while minimizing any<br>
appearance of optical defects, the challenge then being to therefore have thin-film stacks<br>
of constant optical/thermal performance, whether or not they subsequently undergo one<br>
or more heat treatments.<br>
A first solution was proposed in European patent application N° EP 718 250.<br>
This recommended the use, above the silver-based functional layer(s), of oxygen-<br>
diffusion barrier layers, especially those based on silicon nitride, and the direct<br>
deposition of silver layers on the subjacent dielectric coating, without interposition of<br>
priming layers or metal protection layers. That patent application describes in particular<br>
a stack of the type:<br>
substrate/Si3N4 or AIN/ZnO/Ag/Nb/ZnO/Si3N4.<br>
A second solution was proposed in European patent application N°<br>
EP 847 965. This relies on stacks comprising two silver layers and describes the use<br>
both of a barrier layer on top of the silver layers (as previously) and of an absorbent or<br>
stabilizing layer which is adjacent to said silver layers and allows them to be stabilized.<br>
That patent application describes in particular a stack of the type:<br>
substrate/Sn02/ZnO/Agl/Nb/Si3N4/ZnO/Ag2/Nb/SnO2/Si3N4.<br>
In the above two solutions, it should be noted that the presence of the<br>
absorbent "overblocker" metal layer, made of niobium in this case, or even titanium, on<br>
the silver layers makes it possible to prevent the silver layers from coming into contact<br>
with an oxidizing or nitriding reactive atmosphere during deposition by reactive<br>
sputtering of the SnO2 layer or the Si3N4 layer respectively.<br>
A third solution has since been disclosed in International patent application N°<br>
WO 03/01105. This proposes to deposit the absorbent "blocker" metal layer not on the<br>
(or each) functional layer, but underneath, so as to allow the functional layer to be<br>
stabilized during the heat treatment and to improve the optical quality of the stack after<br>
heat treatment.<br>
That patent application describes in particular a stack of the type:<br>
substrate/Si3N4/ZnO/Ti/Agl/ZnO/Si3N4/ZnO/Ti/Ag2/ZnO/Si3N4.<br><br>
However, within the thickness ranges disclosed, such a stack cannot be used to<br>
produce a heated window or electromagnetically shielded window of acceptable<br>
appearance (optical characteristics).<br>
The prior art also teaches thin-film stacks on a substrate that can be used for<br>
thermal control and for heated windows when they are subjected to an electrical current.<br>
International patent application N° WO 01/14136 thus discloses a stack consisting of a<br>
silver double layer that withstands a toughening heat treatment, which can be used for<br>
solar control and for producing heat when it is subjected to an electrical current.<br>
However, the resistivity of this stack does not allow true effective electromagnetic<br>
shielding to be achieved as its resistance per square R⁬ cannot be close to, and a fortiori<br>
less than, 1.5 ohms per square.<br>
In addition, for heated window application in automobiles, this high resistance<br>
per square requires the use of a battery with a high voltage across its terminals (around<br>
42 volts, the standard voltage available on the market) in order to be able to heat over<br>
the entire height of the window. Specifically, by applying the formula P(W) =<br>
U2/(R⁬xh2), if R⁬ = 1.5 ohms per square, to achieve P = 600 W/m2 (the estimated power<br>
dissipated for correct heating) and to obtain a heating height h &gt; 0.8 meters, it is<br>
necessary that U &gt; 24 volts.<br>
It is also known to produce thin-film stacks for electromagnetic shielding<br>
using a substrate provided with an electromagnetic protection stack providing good<br>
electromagnetic protection and allowing the user to easily see the image display thanks<br>
to a high light transmittance together with a low reflectance.<br>
To achieve electromagnetic shielding, the prior art also teaches, from<br>
International patent application N° WO 01/81262, a stack in particular of the type:<br>
substrate/Si3N4/ZnO/Agl/Ti/Si3N4/ZnO/Ag2/Ti/ZnO/Si3N4.<br>
This stack can withstand a toughening or bending heat treatment. However,<br>
this stack does not make it possible to achieve a resistance per square that is much less<br>
than 1.8 ohms per square with optical characteristics (TL, RL, color, etc.) that are<br>
deemed to be acceptable, and especially a low light reflection RL in the visible.<br>
Silver-film-based stacks are manufactured in very complex manufacturing<br>
units-.<br>
The major drawback of the prior art lies in the fact that it is essential to make<br>
major modifications to the production line when it is desired to use the production line<br><br>
to manufacture, on the substrate, a thin-film stack that does not- have the same<br>
application(s) as the stack manufactured previously on this same line.<br>
In general, this operation lasts from several hours to several days, it is tedious<br>
and entails a very substantial loss of money, as it is not possible to produce glazing<br>
during this transition/adjustment period.<br>
In particular, whenever the material of the target differs from one product to<br>
the next, the chamber must be returned to atmospheric pressure before the target is<br>
changed, then the chamber must be pumped down to a vacuum (of the order of 10-6<br>
bar), which is obviously time consuming and tedious.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to alleviate these drawbacks by<br>
proposing a substrate with a thin-film stack and a manufacturing process of this<br>
substrate that make it possible to obtain a product that can be used, alternatively or<br>
cumulatively, for thermal control and/or electromagnetic shielding and/or heating.<br>
In particular, the object of the invention is to make it possible to produce a<br>
large range of products without having to open the deposition installation in order to<br>
change target, so as to save time needed for venting to the atmosphere and above all the<br>
time to recreate a vacuum in the installation after the target has been changed.<br>
The present invention thus proposes a particular stack, defined in terms of the<br>
composition of the various layers and their thickness, which can be used for all these<br>
applications at the same time, but also a type of stack, defined in terms of composition<br>
of the various layers, of thickness ranges and/or of optical characteristics, in which<br>
certain thickness values favor use for a given application. This stack is noteworthy in<br>
that it has a low resistance per square (R⁬ 
substantially maintaining its characteristics when it is subjected to a heat treatment of<br>
the bending or toughening type.<br>
Thus, by virtue of this type of stack according to the invention, to manufacture<br>
stacks intended for a single specific application or only two specific applications or the<br>
three specific applications, one or more parameters can be changed, such as the<br>
thickness of certain layers, but the composition generally remains identical. A few hours<br>
thus suffice for modifying the production line and switching from the manufacture of a<br>
product having one or more preferred applications to another product having one or<br>
more other preferred applications.<br>
Thus, one subject of the present invention is a transparent substrate, especially<br>
made of glass, as claimed in claim 1. This substrate is provided with a thin-film stack<br><br>
comprising a plurality of functional layers, said thin-film stack comprising at least three<br>
silver-based functional layers, the said stack having a resistance R⁬ 
1.3 Ω per square, and said substrate being able to undergo at least one transformation<br>
operation involving a heat treatment at a temperature of at least 500°C, so as to be able<br>
to produce, using the substrate, alternatively or cumulatively, thermal control and/or<br>
electromagnetic shielding and/or heating.<br>
The expression "said substrate may undergo at least one transformation<br>
operation involving a heat treatment at a temperature of at least 500°C" is understood to<br>
mean the fact that the treatment does not degrade the optical quality nor does it cause<br>
the appearance of pitting visible to the naked eye and/or of haze in transmission, when<br>
carrying out a bending, toughening or annealing operation at a temperature of at least<br>
500°C or upper than 500 °C.<br>
Moreover, the resistance R⁬ claimed is, unless otherwise indicated, measured<br>
before this optional heat treatment.<br>
In a first application, for the production of automobile windows, the substrate<br>
according to the invention has a light transmission TL &gt; 70% and a resistance R⁬ 
or even 
In a second application, for the production of building windows, the<br>
transparent substrate according to the invention has a light transmission TL &gt; 40%, or<br>
even &gt; 50%, preferably with a light reflection in the visible RL 10%, or even 
and when it is combined with at least one other substrate to form a glazing assembly,<br>
this glazing assembly has a selectivity &gt; 2, or even &gt; 2.<br>
It will be recalled here that selectivity is defined by the ratio of the light<br>
transmission (TL) to the solar factor (SF), i.e. TL / SF, the solar factor representing the<br>
sum of the direct energy transmission (TE) of the glazing and of the energy absorbed by<br>
the glazing and retransmitted into the interior of the building.<br>
In a third application, for producing electromagnetically shielded glazing, the<br>
transparent substrate according to the invention has a light transmission TL &gt; 40%, or<br>
even &gt; 50%, and even better still &gt; 55%, and a resistance R⁬ 
square.<br>
The major advantage resulting from the fact that the electromagnetically<br>
shielded substrate withstands a heat treatment of the toughening type or the like is that it<br>
is thus possible to use a lighter substrate. Furthermore, experiments have shown that it<br><br>
is always more practical, from the industrial standpoint, to use a substrate coated with a<br>
stack' that withstands a heat treatment rather than to use a substrate that has undergone a<br>
heat treatment and then a stack deposited on top of it.<br>
The substrate on which the stack is deposited is preferably made of glass.<br>
Usually, within the context of the present invention, since the stack is<br>
deposited on the substrate, this substrate establishes a zero level and the layers<br>
deposited on top establish superjacent levels that may be numbered in an increasing<br>
order by whole numbers in order to distinguish them. In the present document, the<br>
numbering is used only to distinguish the functional layers and their order of deposition.<br>
The term "upper layer" or "lower layer" is understood to mean a layer that is<br>
not necessarily deposited strictly on top of or beneath, respectively, the functional layer<br>
during production of the stack, it being possible for one or more layers to be inserted<br>
therebetween. Since each functional layer is associated with one or more layers<br>
deposited beneath or on top of the functional layer whose presence in the stack is<br>
justified with respect to this functional layer, it may be said that the association, i.e.<br>
functional layer with its one or more subjacent and/or superjacent layer(s), produces a<br>
"feature".<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the substrate comprises at least four<br>
silver-based functional layers.<br>

than or equal to 25 nm. This total thickness is preferably substantially between 35 and<br>

According to this variant of the invention, the thicknesses of the constituent<br>

5 to 15/10 to 17/... 5 to 15/25 to 65 nm and preferably 5 to 15/10 to 17/ 0.2 to 3/5 to<br>

invention for producing, alternatively or cumulatively, thermal control and/or<br>

the invention when producing a stack according to the invention are enormous, since it<br>
is no longer necessary to stop the production line for several days or at least several<br><br>
hours when it is desired to produce stacks for one or more different application(s). A<br>
few hours suffice for modifying the production parameters on the line and to obtain a<br>
saleable product for the desired application(s).<br>
Also advantageously, the substrate according to the invention can be used for<br>
producing monolithic glazing, double or triple glazing or laminated glazing and to<br>
achieve, alternatively or cumulatively, thermal control and/or electromagnetic shielding<br>
and/or heating.<br>
Thus, for the automobile application, it is possible to produce laminated<br>
glazing that incorporates a substrate according to the invention, this glazing achieving,<br>
at the same time:<br>
thermal control (more precisely solar control for reflecting solar radiation<br>
on the outside of the vehicle);<br>
electromagnetic shielding for protecting the interior of the vehicle from<br>
external electromagnetic radiation; and<br>
heating, for melting ice or for evaporating condensation.<br>
Likewise, for the building application, it is possible to produce double glazing<br>
that incorporates a substrate according to the invention, this glazing achieving, at the<br>
same time:<br>
thermal control (solar control for reflecting solar radiation on the outside<br>
of the room equipped with the glazing and/or thermal insulation for reflecting internal<br>
radiation into the room equipped with the glazing);<br>
electromagnetic shielding, for protecting the interior of the room<br>
equipped with the glazing from external electromagnetic radiation; and<br>
heating, for eliminating condensation or preventing its formation, and for<br>
preventing the sensation of a "cold wall" near the glazing.<br>
Advantageously, such glazing incorporating a substrate according to the<br>
invention has attractive colors in transmission and in reflection.<br>
The present invention will be more clearly understood on reading the detailed<br>
description below of non-limiting illustrative examples and on examining the figures<br>

1- Examples of stacks for heated windows and more particularly for<br>
windshields supplied with 12 V<br>
The dissipated poVver for correct heating is generally estimated to be<br>
600 W/m2.<br>
Specifically, P(W) = U2/(R⁬xh2). If U = 12 V, then it is necessary that R⁬ = 1<br>
ohm per square for h = 50 cm; h corresponding to the height of the "window" in which<br>
the heating is carried out, so as to prevent the formation of condensation and/or ice (in<br>
practice, the voltage U is from 12 to 14 V, which corresponds to the voltage across the<br>
terminals of the batteries of most motor vehicles currently produced; however, this<br>
voltage could be between 12 and 24 V.<br>
For the automobile application, a stack having the following characteristics (as<br>
laminated glazing) may be deemed to be satisfactory:<br>
•	R⁬ 1.2 ohms per square;<br>
•	good quality (no defects perceptible to the naked eye) after bending;<br>
•	TL &gt; 70% and limited RL;<br>
•	color in reflection deemed to be attractive (preferably a* 
•	satisfactory mechanical and chemical durability.<br><br>
Solutions having two silver layers encapsulated in dielectrics do not make it<br>
possible to obtain both aTL&gt; 70% and a resistance R⁬ 
acceptable color.<br>
To achieve the desired result, it appears preferable:<br>
•	to position the thin-film stack comprising the functional layers on face 3<br>
(face 1 being the face furthest to the outside of the vehicle and face 4 being the<br>
innermost face); and<br>
•	to deposit more than two silver layers, taking into account the necessary<br>
total thickness of the silver layers.<br>
Examples of the construction of stacks according to the invention are given<br>
below with stacks comprising three functional layers (Examples 11,12 and 14) and with<br>
four functional layers (Examples 15 and 16), the results having been measured after a<br>
toughening operation at 620°C for about 8 minutes.<br><br><br><br><br>
three-layer examples according to the invention, Examples 11 and 12, whereas it is<br>
around 7xl0'6 ohms.cm for the two-layer Comparative Example 13.<br>
In the Examples 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 according to the invention, the TL, RL<br>
and color values are relatively stable.<br>
The energy reflection values are very high, which was expected owing to the<br>
cumulative thickness of silver (3x12.75 nm). Excellent selectivity (Ti/FS close to or<br>
even greater than 2 in the case of a laminated specimen) was obtained.<br>
The resistivity of the silver layers included in the three-layer stacks comprising<br>
silver layers having a thickness of about 13 nm is surprisingly low cdmpared with the<br>
values obtained with a two-layer stack comprising silver layers having a thickness of<br>
about 8 to 9 nm.<br>
The optical quality of the four examples according to the invention after<br>
bending is satisfactory - there is no haze or corrosion pitting observable under normal<br>
conditions.<br>
The chemical and mechanical durability of these stacks according to the<br>
invention is also very good.<br>
2- Examples of stacks for thermal-control, particularly solar-control, glazing<br>
for buildings<br>
The performance of a solar-controlled product is evaluated on the basis of the<br>
"selectivity" criterion, that is to say the ratio of the light transmission (TL) of the glazing<br>
to the percentage amount of solar energy penetrating the inside of the building (solar<br>
factor or SF). In order to obtain the highest possible selectivity, while still maintaining a<br>
good level of light transmission (needed for the comfort of the occupants of the rooms),<br>
it is important to find glazing that will ensure as abrupt as possible a transmission cutoff<br>
between the visible range and the infrared range, and thus prevent the energy contained<br>
in this part of the spectrum being transmitted (Parry-Moon (PM) curve). The ideal<br>
spectrum for solar-controlled glazing is therefore a step function, ensuring transmission<br>
in the visible but completely cutting off the infrared.<br>
The definition of stacks having three silver layers and four silver layers<br>
according to the invention makes it possible to increase this selectivity. This is because,<br>
for well-chosen silver thicknesses and dielectric thicknesses, the transmission spectrum<br>
of glazing comprising this type of stack approaches a step function and therefore makes<br><br>
it possible, for the same level of transmission, for the selectivity to be substantially<br>
increased. This can be achieved without losing the color neutrality of the glazing, both<br>
in transmission and in reflection.<br>
Examples of stack constructions are given below with stacks comprising three<br>
functional layers (Examples 21 and 23) and with four functional layers (Example 24),<br>
these being compared with stacks having two functional layers (Examples 22 and 25),<br>
for obtaining, respectively, a transmission level of 50% (Examples 21 and 22) and a<br>
transmission level of 60% (Examples 23 to 25) and optimized selectivity.<br>
All these examples were produced according to the following scheme:<br>
outside/glass (6 mm)/stack/space(15 mm)/glass (6 mm)/inside,<br>
with a space filled with a mixture of 90% argon and 10% dry air, and the results given<br>
below were measured after a toughening operation at 620°C for about 8 minutes.<br><br><br><br>
Comparison between the spectra of Examples 21, 23 and 24 according to the<br>
invention with Comparative Examples 22 and 25 over the entire solar spectrum,<br>
illustrated in figures 2 to 4, clearly shows that the three-layer stacks make it possible to<br>
approach the step function (very sudden drop in transmission at around 780 nm - end of<br>
the visible range and start of the infrared range). The same applies to the four-layer<br>
stacks. Moreover, this increase in selectivity is not obtained to the detriment of the<br>
colorimetric response of the glazing, the color in external reflection of the glazing being<br>
neutral (in the L*a*b* system), a* and b* being negative and of low absolute value. In<br>
addition, the color in transmission does not have a higher purity, which allows the<br>
occupants of rooms to appreciate the outdoor environment in their true colors. This<br>
point can be seen in figure 3, which shows the superposition of the spectra of Examples<br>
21 and 22 and the sensitivity of the human eye. In fact, this graph shows that the optical<br><br>
filter produced using the thin-film stack of Example 21 is broader, in terms of<br>
wavelength, than the distribution of the sensitivity of the human eye.<br>
3- Examples of stacks for electromagneticallv shielded glazing and more<br>
particularly for plasma screens<br>
The structure of the stack produced for verifying the benefit of the invention in<br>
the case of electromagnetic shielding is the following:<br>
- clear glass substrate (2 mm)/thin-film stack having at least three functional<br>
layers.<br>
The toughening carried out prior to the measurements was introduced by<br>
annealing the substrate provided with the stack at a temperature of about 620°C for 5<br>
minutes.<br><br><br><br>
It may be seen that the toughening operation lowers the resistivity of the silver<br>
and slightly modifies the optical properties of the stack. Specifically, in the case of<br>
Example 31, the resistance of this stack before annealing was R⁬ = 1.1 Ω/⁬ (for a<br>
resistivity of 5.5x10-6 ohms.cm) i.e. a reduction of about 18%; in the case of Example<br>
32, the resistance of this stack before annealing was R⁬ = 0.9 Ω/⁬ (for a resistivity of<br>
5.0xl0"6 ohms.cm) i.e. a reduction of about 22%; and in the case of-Example 33, the<br>
resistance of this stack before annealing was R⁬ = 1.5 Ω/⁬ i.e. a reduction of about<br>
20%. However, the toughening operation results in no major change to the color.<br>
The stack according to the invention may be used in an assembly having, for<br>
example, the structure illustrated in figure 5, so as to produce an electromagnetic filter<br>
for a screen using plasma technology. This assembly comprises:<br>
1-	an optional antireflection layer;<br>
2-	a substrate made of clear glass, but which could also be tinted;<br>
3-	a thin-film stack having at least three functional layers;<br>
4-	a sheet of plastic, made of PVB, which could also optionally be made of<br>
PSA;<br>
5-	an optional PET film.<br>
The thin-film stack is thus positioned on face 2 of the assembly.<br>
The substrate receiving the stack can be toughened after the stack has been<br>
deposited.<br>
The present invention has been described in the foregoing by way of example.<br>
Of course, a person skilled in the art is capable of realizing various alternative<br>
embodiments of the invention without thereby departing from the scope of the patent as<br>
