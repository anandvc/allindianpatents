				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to electronic devices comprising an audio<br>
amplifier and to methods for controlling such electronic devices.<br>
Such electronic devices are widely used nowadays. The signal<br>
generated by the amplifier is sent directly or through another amplifier to<br>
loudspeakers for the reproduction of sound.<br>
A problem may occur when the working mode of the device changes<br>
because the energy supplied to the amplifier may vary in a uncontrolled way<br>
and the generated signal may consequently be disturbed. This would give rise<br>
to what is known as a pop sound in the loudspeakers.<br>
Various solutions have been proposed to reduce the disturbances.<br>
It was for instance disclosed in patent application EP 0 785 501 to<br>
use a TTL POWERGOOD signal generated by a dedicated power failure<br>
detector of a power supply described in U.S. patent No. 5 224 010 : a delayed<br>
version of POWERGOOD is utilised to mute the audio amplifier during the<br>
power-up and POWERGOOD is used to mute the audio amplifier during the<br>
power down.<br>
However, such a power failure detector is a costly element and<br>
cheap power supplies are not provided with any.<br>
Another solution which has been used is described as prior art in<br>
patent application EP 0 862 265 : a microprocessor mutes the audio amplifier<br>
through a specific pin during interrupt routines which are triggered upon<br>
detection of a decreasing supply voltage. As explained in the patent application,<br>
this method is too slow, as the muting action is only generated after the<br>
decrease in voltage which creates the disturbance.<br>
EP 0 862 286 proposes another solution using a fly-back<br>
transformer. This solution cannot therefore be implemented in electronic<br>
devices where such a fly-back transformer is not provided. Moreover, the<br>
proposed solution still uses a Zener diode, which is an expensive component.<br>
The present invention seeks a solution to reduce the cost of the<br>
electronic device while at the same time reducing further the disturbances<br>
generated by the audio amplifier.<br>
The invention proposes an electronic device comprising :<br>
- an audio amplifier with a mute pin ;<br>
- a first micro-processor connected to the mute pin ;<br>
- a second micro-processor having a mode pin ;<br>
- a muting circuit with an input connected to the mode pin and with<br>
an output connected to the mute pin.<br>
Further possible features are the following :<br>
- a delay part of the muting circuit has an input connected to the<br>
mode pin and an output connected to a standby pin of the audio amplifier;<br>
- the delay part comprises a RC network interposed between the<br>
mode pin and the standby pin ;<br>
- the RC network is connected to the base of a transistor whose<br>
collector is connected to the standby pin through a resistor;<br>
- a capacitor is interposed between the mode pin and the base of a<br>
transistor;<br>
- the collector of said transistor is connected to the mute pin via a<br>
diode and a resitor in series ;<br>
- the output of the muting circuit and a control pin of the first micro-<br>
processor are input to an OR circuit connected to the mute pin.<br>
The invention further proposes a method for controlling the electronic<br>
device, comprising the succesive steps of:<br>
- generating a signal representative of an ON operating mode of the<br>
device on the mode pin ;<br>
- generating a signal representative of an OFF operating mode of the<br>
device on the mode pin ;<br>
- transmitting the signal representative of an OFF operating mode of<br>
the device to the mute pin through the muting circuit;<br>
- muting the audio amplifier.<br>
Another feature of this method is possibly that the electronic device<br>
further includes a power supply with at least a DC output and that the period of<br>
time for transmitting the signal representative of an OFF operating mode of the<br>
device to the mute pin through the muting circuit is shorter than time constant of<br>
the DC output.<br>
The invention also proposes a method for controlling the electronic<br>
device, comprising the successive steps of:<br>
- generating a signal representative of an OFF operating mode of the<br>
device on the mode pin ;<br>
- generating a signal representative of an ON operating mode of the<br>
device on the mode pin ;<br>
- switching the audio amplifier to standby mode when the signal<br>
representative of the ON mode is received on the standby pin ;<br>
- waiting for a given period of time ;<br>
- switching the audio amplifier to normal mode.<br>
The invention and other features thereof will be better understood in the tight of<br>
the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
where:<br>
-figure 1 represents schematically the main elements of the electronic device of<br>
the invention;<br>
-figure 2 is schematics of a detailed implementation of the invention<br>
figures 3a to 3h are diagrams representing the voltage at various points of the<br>
schematics of figure 2 for different operating modes.<br>
In the embodiment described below, the invention is implemented on a TV set.<br>
For sound reproduction, the TV set mainly includes an audio processing circuit 2,<br>
an audio amplifier 4 and a loudspeaker 6. The audio processing circuit 2 extracts<br>
an audio signal from a composite video signal (CVBS) received for instance from<br>
a front-end (turner and demodulator) or from a video player (VCR or DVD-player<br>
for instance).<br>
The audio signal generated by the audio processing circuit 2 is amplified by the<br>
audio amplifier 4 and then sent to the loudspeaker 6 which generates<br>
corresponding sounds.<br>
The TV set has a power supply (not represented ) generated on its outputs<br>
various direct current (DC) voltages. It can for instance be a switched-mode<br>
power supply (SMPS) as widely used in TV sets. On its Ua output 22, the power<br>
supply generates 22 V when the TV set is ON. The amplifier 4 is electrically fed<br>
by the Ua output.<br>
The TV set includes a main microprocessor 8 and a specific user interface (UI)<br>
microprocessor 10. Generally speaking, a specific microprocessor 10 is dedicated<br>
to some electronic circuits of the TV set, here user interface (UI) circuits,<br>
amongst which the audio amplifier 4. The UI microprocessor 10 has a control pin<br>
12 connected to a mute pin 16 of the amplifier 4 via a OR circuit 14. When the<br>
UI microprocessor 10 generates a mute signal on its control pin 12, the amplifier<br>
4 receives the mute signal on its mute pin 16 and as a consequence stops<br>
sending any signal to the loudspeaker 6.<br>
The main processor 8 and the UI processor 10 are linked via a bi-directional link<br>
18, for instance an 12C port. The main microprocessor 8 has a mode pin 20<br>
generating a mode signal representative of the operating mode of the TV set.<br>
For instance, mode pin 20 is at a high level of voltage (5 V) when the TV set is<br>
on (which means every electronic circuit is fed by the power supply and able to<br>
operate) and at low level (0 V) when the set is off or in<br>
standby (which means at least part of the electronic circuits is not fed by the<br>
power supply or not operating).<br>
The mode signal is received by switchable circuits (which status is<br>
dependent upon the operating mode), amongst which specific switchable<br>
circuits 24 (for instance a tuner or a video processing circuit), the Ul<br>
microprocessor 10 and a muting circuit 26 which will be described below with<br>
further details.<br>
The muting circuit 26 is also electrically fed from the Ua output 22 of<br>
the power supply. The muting circuit 26 is connected to the mute pin 16 of the<br>
amplifier 4 via the OR circuit 14. A muting signal from the muting circuit 26 thus<br>
also mutes the loudspeaker 6.<br>
Figure 2 represents a detailed implementation of the circuit of figure<br>
1. The audio amplifier 4 is an integrated circuit (IC) with a plurality of pins.<br>
Two input pins 40, 42 are connected to the signal processing circuit<br>
for respectively receiving audio signals to be amplified and transmitted via<br>
output pins 36, 38 to a first loudspeaker 6 and a second loudspeaker 7 (only<br>
one loudspeaker 6 was represented on figure 1 for clarity). Capacitors C4 and<br>
C5 are interposed between the respective output pins 36, 38 and loudspeakers<br>
6,7 to filter out DC voltages.<br>
A volume pin 34 and the mute pin 16 are connected to the Ul<br>
microprocessor 10. The volume pin 34 carries signals representative of the<br>
volume of reproduction selected by the user. These signals are sent by the Ul<br>
microprocessor 10 (from point V), for instance depending on information stored<br>
in a memory linked to the Ul microprocessor 10 and which can be modified by<br>
the user, for instance through an on-screen display (OSD) menu.<br>
The mute pin 16 is connected to the control pin 12 of the Ul<br>
microprocessor 10 trough a resistor R10 and a diode D2 in series. As for the<br>
volume control, the Ul microprocessor 10 can send a mute instruction (high<br>
level) to the amplifier 4, further to a corresponding command from the user. It<br>
can be noted that a capacitor C3 is connected between a grounded point 23<br>
and the end of resistor R10 opposite the control pin 12. This capacitor C3 is<br>
meant to avoid sharp voltage transients at mute pin 16 in order to get rid of<br>
"click" sounds when muting is activated/deactivated by the Ul microprocessor<br>
10.<br>
The amplifier 4 is fed from Ua output on a power pin 44 with<br>
interposition of an inductance L1 in series with a resistor R11 (which represents<br>
the resistance of the wire).<br>
The muting circuit 26 includes a first part 28 which is designed for<br>
transitions from ON to OFF and which will now be described.<br>
A transistor T1 has its emitter connected to ground 23 and its<br>
collector connected to Ua output 22 via a resistor R3. Its base is connected on<br>
the one hand to the mode pin 20 via a resistor R2 and a capacitor C1 in<br>
parallel, and on the other hand to ground 23 via a resistor R1.<br>
The collector of transistor T1 is connected to a standby pin 32 of the<br>
amplifier 4 via a diode D1. The standby pin 32 is in turn connected to the mute<br>
pin 16 through a resistor R9.<br>
The muting circuit 26 also includes a second part 30 which is<br>
designed for OFF to ON transitions and which will now be described.<br>
A transistor T2 has its emitter connected to ground 23 and its<br>
collector connected a voltage divider; more precisely, the emitter of transistor<br>
T2 is connected via a resistor R8 to Ua output 22 and via a resistor R7 to<br>
ground 23. The collector of transistor T2 is connected to the standby pin 32<br>
through a resistor R6.<br>
The base of transistor T2 is linked to the mode pin 20 via a resistor<br>
R4 and a diode D3 in parallel and to ground 23 via a resistor R5 and capacitor<br>
C2 in parallel.<br>
The way the muting circuit 26 operates will now be described in view<br>
of figures 3a to 3h.<br>
The voltage at Ua output 22 is represented at figure 3a. When the<br>
TV set is off, the voltage of Ua output 22 is of course 0 V. When the TV set is<br>
switched on, the voltage of Ua output 22 rises relatively slowly to its nominal<br>
value of 22 V due to the necessary regulation of the power supply to generate<br>
DC voltages. All the same, when switching off the TV set, the fall in voltage at<br>
Ua output 22 is relatively slow. These phenomena occur with a given time<br>
constant, for instance about 4 s.<br>
At the opposite, the voltage at the mode pin 20 (5VS) strictly<br>
corresponds to the ON and OFF mode as explained above and represented at<br>
figure 3b, with sharp transient, as the mode pin 20 is meant to transmit<br>
information regarding the operating mode of the TV set to other circuitry (like<br>
the specific switchable circuit 24) when receiving an instruction from the user.<br>
The voltages at the base and at the collector of transistor T1 are<br>
represented respectively at figures 3c and 3d.<br>
When in the ON mode, the voltage at the base of T1 is imposed by<br>
the voltage divider R1, R2 which resistance values are set so that the transistor<br>
T1 is on ; the capacitor C1 is charged. As the transistor T1 is on, the voltage at<br>
the emitter of T1 is low and the diode D1 is blocked. Consequently, the first part<br>
28 of the muting circuit 26 has no influence on the amplifier pins during the On<br>
mode.<br>
When the voltage at mode pin 20 falls to 0 V, the capacitor C1 is still<br>
charged which immediately generates a corresponding negative voltage at the<br>
base of T1. The transistor T1 is therefore very quickly switched off which<br>
generates a high voltage of about 5 V at the collector of T1, thus opening diode<br>
D1 and pulling standby pin 32 and mute pin 16 (which voltages are represented<br>
respectively at figure 3g and 3h) to high level. The amplifier 4 is hence muted.<br>
It is important to note that thanks to capacitor C1 the muting is very<br>
fast (less than 10 ms) and the spurious noises generated by the slower fall of<br>
Ua have no time to occur. The first part 28 of the muting circuit 26 acts as a fast<br>
inverter.<br>
When the voltage at mute pin 16 is set at a high level by the muting<br>
circuit 26 as described above, the diode D2 is blocked and capacitor C3 has<br>
thus no effect of slowing the rise of the voltage at mute pin 16. This is on<br>
purpose, as the goal during ON to OFF transition is not to avoid click sounds<br>
but to get rid of the much louder pop sound.<br>
Afterwards, the voltage at Ua output 22 falls (slowly relative to the<br>
blocking of T1), which cause the voltage in every part of the muting circuit 26<br>
and at pins 16, 32 to fall too. But during this fall in voltage, the amplifier 4 is<br>
muted which avoids pop noises.<br>
To sum up, the goal of the first part 28 of the muting circuit 26 is too<br>
mute the amplifier 4 very quickly when the TV set is switched off.<br>
The operation of the second part 30 of the muting circuit 26 is<br>
described below. The voltages at the base and at the collector of transistor T2<br>
are represented respectively on figures 3e and 3f.<br>
When the TV set is switched on, the voltage of the mode pin 20 goes<br>
up very quickly. As a consequence, the diode D3 is blocked and the resistors<br>
R4 and R5 together with the capacitor C2 (realising a RC network) generate a<br>
slow rise (time constant of 8 s) of the voltage at the base of T2 from 0 V, where<br>
the transistor T2 is switched off, until the voltage rises to 0.6 V, when the<br>
transistor T2 is then activated.<br>
After the rising edge on the mode pin 20 is received, there will thus<br>
be a period of time (about 4 s) during which the transistor is still blocked.<br>
The collector of transistor T2 will thus be at a high level (determined<br>
by the voltage divider R7, R8 and following the voltage of Ua output) during this<br>
period of time, as depicted on figure 3f.<br>
The voltage at the standby pin 32 is then also at a high level, thereby<br>
transmitting a standby instruction to the amplifier 4. The voltage at the mute pin<br>
16 is then also at a high level.<br>
After said period of time, the transistor T2 is on (as capacitor C2 as<br>
has charged and the voltage at its base results from R4 and R5); the voltage at<br>
the collector of transistor T2 thus falls and standby pin 32 falls as well. The<br>
audio amplifier 4 is no more in standby.<br>
To sum up, the second part 30 of the muting circuit allows to delay<br>
the switch from standby mode of the amplifier 4 to normal mode of the amplifier<br>
4 when the TV set is powered. (For this reason the second part 30 is named<br>
delay part.) It is thereby sure that every other circuit in the apparatus operates<br>
normally before the audio amplifier 4 works, for instance to be sure that<br>
initialisation routines has taken place in the Ul microprocessor 10, which<br>
routines could be delayed with respect to the main microcontroller 8 mode<br>
signal on mode pin 20.<br>
When the TV set is switched off, diode D3 discharges C2 rapidly, so<br>
that the desired standby delay circuit will not be shortened during the next<br>
power up that follows shortly.<br>
