CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of Serial No. 60/999,902, filed October 22, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] This invention relates generally to polyethylene compositions. The invention also relates to polymerization processes utilizing bridged metallocene catalysts for producing polyethylene compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Processability is the ability to economically process and shape a polymer uniformly. Processability involves such elements as how easily the polymer flows, melt strength, and whether or not the extrudate is distortion free. Typical metallocene catalyzed polyethylenes (mPE) are somewhat more difficult to process than low-density polyethylenes (LDPE) made in a high-pressure polymerization process. Generally, mPEs require more motor power and produce higher extruder pressures to match the extrusion rate of LDPEs. Typical mPEs also have lower melt strength which, for example, adversely affects bubble stability during blown film extrusion, and they are prone to melt fracture at commercial shear rates. On the other hand, however, mPEs exhibit superior physical properties as compared to LDPEs.<br>
[0004] It is not unusual in the industry to add various levels of an LDPE to an mPE to increase melt strength, to increase shear sensitivity, i.e., to increase flow at commercial shear rates; and to reduce the tendency to melt fracture. However, these blends generally have poor mechanical properties as compared with neat mPE.<br>
[0005] Traditionally, metallocene catalysts produce polymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution.   Narrow molecular weight distribution polymers<br>
tend to be more difficult to process. The broader the polymer molecular weight distribution the easier the polymer is to process. A technique to improve the processability of mPEs is to broaden the products' molecular weight distribution (MWD) by blending two or more mPEs with significantly different molecular weights, or by changing to a polymerization catalyst or mixture of catalysts that produce broad MWD polymers.<br>
[0006] In the art specific metallocene catalyst compound characteristics have been shown to produce polymers that are easier to process. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,281,679 discusses metallocene catalyst compounds where the ligand is substituted with a substituent having a secondary or tertiary carbon atom to produce broader molecular weight distribution polymers. U.S. Patent No. 5,470,811 describes the use of a rrixture of metallocene catalysts for producing easy processing polymers. U.S. Patent No. 5,798,427 also addresses the production of polymers having enhanced processability using a metallocene catalyst compound where the ligands are specifically substituted indenyl ligands.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 6,339,134 (Crowther et al.) and U.S. Patent No. 6,388,115 (Crowther et al), describe a metallocene catalyst compound represented by the formula L L MQ„, where MQn may be, among other things, zirconium dichloride, and LA and LB may be, among other things, open, acyclic, or fused ring(s) or ring system(s) such as unsubstituted or substituted, cyclopentadienyl ligands or cyclopentadienyl-type ligands, heteroatom substituted and/or heteroatom containing cyclopentadienyl-type ligands. The Q ligands include hydrocarbyl radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
[0008] PCT Publication No. WO 03/064433 ("Holtcamp"), relates to polymerization catalyst activator compounds that are either neutral or ionic and include a Group 13 atom, preferably boron or aluminum, bonded to at least one halogenated or partially halogenated heterocyclic ligand. The publication states that such activator compounds may be used to activate metallocene catalyst compositions. One such catalyst, composition is cyclotetramethylenesilyl (tetramethyl cyclopentadienyl) (cyclopemauicnyl) zirconium dimethyl ("(GjHg) Si(C5Me4)(C5H4)ZrMe2").<br>

Activator and Activation Methods for the Metallocene Catalyst Compounds<br>
[0047] The above described cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compounds are can be activated with an activator comprising an aluminoxane or the product of an aluminoxane and a support or carrier. This activation yields catalyst compounds capable of polymerizing olefins.<br>
[0048] It is well known in the art that aluminoxanes contain a broad distribution of structures formed from the reaction of R"3 Al or mixtures of R"3 Al, where R" is hydrogen or a similar or different hydrocarbyl, with water. This is in contrast with dialuminoxanes which have a specific structure. It is also well recognized that aluminoxanes may contain alanes, R"3A1, remaining from an incomplete hydrolysis reaction.<br>
[0049] The above described cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compounds are typically activated in various ways to yield catalyst compounds having a vacant coordination site that will coordinate, insert, and polymerize olefm(s).<br>
[0050] For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims, the term "activator" is defined to be any compound or component or method which can activate any of the metallocene catalyst compounds of the invention as described above. Non-limiting activators, for example may include a Lewis acid or a non-coordinating ionic activator or ionizing activator or any other compound including Lewis bases, aluminum alkyls, conventional-type cocatalysts or an activator-support and combinations thereof that can convert a neutral metallocene catalyst compound to a catalytically active metallocene cation. It is within the scope of this invention to use alumoxane or modified alumoxane as an activator, and/or to also use ionizing activators, neutral or ionic, such as tri (n-butyl)ammonium tctrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron or a trisperfluorophenyl boron metalloid precursor or a trisperfluoronaphtyl boron metalloid precursor that would ionize the neutral metallocene catalyst compound.<br>
[0051] In one embodiment, an activation method using ionizing ionic compounds not containing an active proton but capable of producing both a metallocene<br>
catalyst cation and a non-coordinating anion are also contemplated, and are described in EP-A-0 426 637, EP-A- 0 573 403 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,568.<br>
[0052] There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451 5,744,656, EP-A-0 561 476, EP-B1-0 279 586 and EP-A-0 594-218, and WO 94/10180.<br>
[0053] Ionizing compounds may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated with but not coordinated to or only loosely coordinated to the remaining ion of the ionizing compound. Such compounds and the like are described in EP-A-0 570 982, EP-A-0 520 732, EP-A-0 495 375, EP-A-500 944, EP-A-0 277 003 and EP-A-0 277 004, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,153,157, 5,198,401, 5,066,741, 5,206,197, 5,241,025, 5,384,299 and 5,502,124, and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/285,380, filed Aug. 3, 1994.<br>
[0054] Other activators include those described in WO 98/07515 such as tris (2, 2', 2"-nonafluorobiphenyl)fluoroaluminate, which publication is fully incorporated herein by reference. Combinations of activators are also contemplated by the invention, for example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators in combinations, see for example, WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,153,157 and 5,453,410. WO 98/09996 describes activating metallocene catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates including their hydrates. WO 98/30602 and WO 98/30603 describe the use of lithium (2,2'-bisphenyl-ditrimethylsilicate). 4THF as an activator for a metallocene catalyst compound. Also, methods of activation such as using radiation (see EP-B1-0 615 981), electro-chemical oxidation, and the like are also contemplated as activating methods for the purposes of rendering the neutral metallocene catalyst compound or precursor to a metallocene-type cation capable of polymerizing olefins.<br>
[0055] It is further contemplated by the invention that other catalysts can be combined  with  the  cyclic  bridged metallocene  catalyst  compounds  of the<br>
invention. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,937,299, 4,935,474, 5,281,679, 5,359,015, 5,470,811, and 5,719,241.<br>
[0056] In another embodiment of the invention one or more metallocene catalyst compounds or catalyst systems may be used in combination with one or more conventional-type or other advanced catalyst compounds or catalyst systems. Non-limiting examples of mixed catalysts and catalyst systems are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,159,965, 4,325,837, 4,701,432, 5,124,418, 5,077,255, 5,183,867, 5,391,660, 5,395,810, 5,691,264 5,723,399 and 5,767,031, and WO 96/23010.<br>

[0057] The above described cyclic metallocene catalyst compounds and catalyst systems may be combined with on; cr more support materials or carriers using one of the support methods well known in the art or as described below. In the preferred embodiment, the method of the invention uses a polymerization catalyst in a supported form. For example, in a most preferred embodiment, a metallocene catalyst compound or catalyst system is in a supported form, for example deposited on, bonded to, contacted with, or incorporated within, adsorbed or absorbed in, or on, a support or carrier.<br>
[0058] The terms "support" or "carrier" are used interchangeably and are any support material, preferably a porous support material, for example, talc, inorganic oxides and inorganic chlorides. Other carriers include resinous support materials such as polystyrene, functionalized or crosslinked organic supports, such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefins or polymeric compounds, zeolites, clays, or any other organic or inorganic support material and the like, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0059] The preferred carriers are inorganic oxides that include those Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 or 14 metal oxides. The preferred supports include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesium chloride, and mixtures thereof. Other useful supports include magnesia, titania, zircoma.tm.orj'noriuonite (EP-B1 0 511 665) and the<br>
like. Also, combinations of these support materials may be used, for example, silica-chromium, silica-alumina, silica-titania and the like.<br>
[0060] It is preferred that the carrier, most preferably an inorganic oxide, has a surface area in the range of from about 10 to about 700 m /g, pore volume in the range of from about 0.1 to about 4.0 cc/g and average particle size in the range of from about 5 to about 500um. More preferably, the surface area of the carrier is in the range of from about 50 to about 500 m /g, pore volume of from about 0.5 to about 3.5 cc/g and average particle size of from about 10 to about 200 um. Most preferably the surface area of the carrier is in the range is from about 100 to about 400 m2/g, pore volume from about 0.8 to about 3.0 cc/g and average particle size is from about 5 to about 100 jam. The average pore size of the carrier of the invention typically has pore size in the, range of from 10 to 1000 A, preferably 50 to about 500 A, and most preferably 75 to about 350 A.<br>
[0061] Examples of supporting the metallocene catalyst systems of the invention are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,701,432, 4,808,561, 4,912,075, 4,925,821, 4,937,217, 5,008,228, 5,238,892, 5,240,894, 5,332,706, 5,346,925, 5,422,325, 5,466,649, 5,466,766, 5,468,702, 5,529,965, 5,554,704, 5,629,253, 5,639,835, 5,625,015, 5,643,847, 5,665,665, 5,698,487, 5,714,424, 5,723,400, 5,723,402, 5,731,261, 5,759,940, 5,767,032 and 5,770,664, U.S. Application Serial No. 271,598 filed Jul. 7, 1994 and Serial No. 788,736 filed Jan. 23, 1997, and WO 95/32995, WO 95/14044, WO 96/06187 and WO 97/02297.<br>
[0062] In one embodiment, the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compounds of the invention may be deposited on the same or separate supports together with an activator, or the activator may be used in an unsupported form, or may be deposited on a support different from the supported metallocene catalyst compounds of the invention, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0063] There are various other methods in the art for supporting a polymerization catalyst compound or catalyst system of the invention. For example, the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compound of the invention may contain a polymer bound ligand as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,473,202 and 5,770,755, the metallocene catalyst system of the invention may be spray dried as described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,648,310, the support used with the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst system of the invention is functionalized as described in EP-A-0 802 203, or at least one substituent or leaving group is selected as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,688,880.<br>
[0064] In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides for a supported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst system that includes an antistatic agent or surface modifier that is used in the preparation of the supported catalyst system as described in WO 96/11960. The catalyst systems of the invention can be prepared in the presence of an olefin, for example hexene-1.<br>
[0065] A preferred method for producing the supported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst system of the invention is described below and is described in WO 96/00245 and WO 96/00243. In this preferred method, the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compound is slurried in a liquid to form a metallocene solution and a separate solution is formed containing an activator and a liquid. The liquid may be any compatible solvent or other liquid capable of forming a solution or the like with the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compounds and/or activator of the invention. In the most preferred embodiment the liquid is a cyclic aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, most preferably toluene. The cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compound and activator solutions are mixed together and added to a porous support or the porous support is added to the solutions such that the total volume of the metallocene catalyst compound solution and the activator solution or the metallocene catalyst compound and activator solution is less than four times the pore volume of the porous support, more preferably less than three times, even more preferably less than two times; preferred ranges being from 1.1 times to 3.5 times range and most preferably in the 1.2 to 3 times range. Another preferred method is to pre-react the porous support with an activator in a hydrocarbon diluent. The hydrocarbon solution of the cyclic bridged metallocene is added later to complete the catalyst preparation.<br>
[0066] Procedures for measuring the total pore volume of a porous support are well known in the art. Details of one of these procedures are discussed in Volume 1,   Experimental   Methods   in   Catalytic   Research   (Academic   Press,   1968)<br>
(specifically see pages 67-96). This preferred procedure involves the use of a classical BET apparatus for nitrogen absorption. Another method well known in the art is described in Innes, Total Porosity and Particle Density of Fluid Catalysts By Liquid Titration, Vol. 28, No. 3, Analytical Chemistry 332-334 (March, 1956).<br>
[0067] The mole ratio of the metal of the activator component to the metal of the supported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compounds are in the range of between 0.3:1 to 1000:1, preferably 20:1 to 800:1, and most preferably 50:1 to 500:1. Where the activator is an ionizing activator such as those based on the anion tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron, the mole ratio of the metal of the activator component to the metal component of the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst is preferably in the range of between 0.3:1 to 3:1. Where an unsupported cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst system is utilized, the mole ratio of the metal of the activator component to the metal of the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst compound is in the range of between 0.3:1 to 10,000:1, preferably 100:1 to 5000:1, and most preferably 500:1 to 2000:1.<br>
[0068] In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst system comprises a catalyst as described herein activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO) and supported by silica. While conventionally, MAO is combined with a metallocene and then the combination is deposited on silica, as shown in the examples, the preference herein is to first combine the activator (e.g. MAO) and the support (e.g. silica) and then to add the catalyst to the combination. Modified MAO (MMAO) or a combination of MAO and MMAO may also be used. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst compound comprises (C4Hg)Si(CsMe4)(C5H4)ZrMe2.<br>
[0069] In one embodiment of the invention, olefm(s), preferably C2 to C30 olefin(s) or alpha-olefin(s), preferably ethylene or propylene or combinations thereof are prepolymerized in the presence of the cyclic bridged metallocene catalyst system of the invention prior to the main polymerization. The prepolymerization can be carried out batchwise or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase including at elevated pressures. The prepolymerization can take place with any olefin monomer or combination and/or in the presence of any molecular weight  controlling  agent  such  as  hydrogen.     For  examples  of<br>
prepolymerization procedures, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,748,221, 4,789,359, 4,923,833, 4,921,825, 5,283,278 and 5,705,578, EP-B-0279 863, and WO 97/44371.<br>
[0070] In one embodiment the polymerization catalyst is used in an unsupported form, preferably in a liquid form such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,317,036 and 5,693,727, and EP-A-0 593 083. The polymerization catalyst in liquid form can be fed to a reactor as described in WO 97/46599.<br>
[0071] In one embodiment, the cyclic bridged metallocene catalysts of the invention can be combined with a c'arboxylic acid salt of a metal ester, for example aluminum carboxylates such as aluminum mono, di- and tri- stearates, aluminum octoates, oleates and cyclohexylbutyrates, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,300,436.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
[0072] The catalysts and catalyst systems of the invention described above are suitable for use in any polymerization process over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The temperatures may be in the range of from -60°C to about 280°C, preferably from 50°C to about 200°C, and the pressures employed may be in the range from 1 atmosphere to about 500 atmospheres or higher.<br>
[0073] Polymerization processes include solution, gas phase, slurry phase and a high pressure process or a combination thereof. Particularly preferred is a gas phase or slurry phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene.<br>
[0074] In one embodiment, the process of this invention is directed toward a solution, high pressure, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefin monomers of ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-l, hexene-1, octene- 1 and decene-1.<br>
[0075] Other monomers useful in the process of the invention include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefms having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic olefins. Non-limiting monomers useful in the invention may include norbornene, norbornadiene, isobutylene, isoprene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene norbornene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene.<br>
[0076] In a preferred embodiment of the procesc of the invention, a copolymer of ethylene is produced, where with styrenes a comonomer having at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and most preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, is polymerized in a gas phase process. In the most preferred embodiment, a copolymer of ethylene and butene is produced.<br>
[0077] In another embodiment of the process of the invention, ethylene or propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a terpolymer. In one embodiment, two of the three monomers of the terpolymer are butene and ethylene. In one embodiment, the comonomer content is 1.0 to 20.0 wt%, or 2.0 to 15.0 wt%. As seen in example 5 below, the use of (C4H8)Si(C5Me4)(C5H4)ZrMe2 as the catalyst in preparing an ethylene/butene copolymer, resulted in a sharp response to comonomer ratio. That is, the melt index (MI) changed quickly and sharply as the comonomer ratio was adjusted. Density changes were also observed. These changes may be associated with long chain branching. Therefore, polymers having ethylene and butene as two of the monomers may be used to control product melt index. Further, products with broad or bimodal distribution in molecular weight or melt index in a single reactor using a single catalyst could be used by changing the comonomer feed in a controlled fashion, thus producing polyethylene products with custom designed properties with single reactor economics.<br>
[0078] In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a polymerization process, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase process, for polymerizing propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and/or other olefins<br>
having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Polypropylene polymers may be produced using the particularly bridged metallocene catalysts as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,296,434 and 5,278,264.<br>
[0079] Typically in a gas phase polymerization process, a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat ih removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228.)<br>
[0080] The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa).<br>
[0081] The reactor temperature in a gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 70°C to 110°C, and mqst preferably in the range of from about 70°C to about 95°C.<br>
[0082]   Typical polymerization conditions are set forth in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Typical Polymerization Conditions<br>
(Table Removed ) [0083] Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the invention include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and EP-A-0 794 200, EP-A-0 802 202 and EP-B-634 421.<br>
[0084] In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present invention is capable and the process of the invention is producing greater than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 lbs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr), even more preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 lbs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 lbs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
[0085] A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical<br>
temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
[0086] A preferred polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,484.<br>
[0087] In an embodiment the reactor used in the slurry process of the invention is capable of and the process of the invention is producing greater than 2000 lbs of polymer per hour (907 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 5000 lbs/hr (2268 Kg/hr), and most preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr). In another embodiment the slurry reactor used in the process of the invention is producing greater than 15,000 lbs of polymer per hour (6804 Kg/hr), preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to about 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
[0088] Examples of solution processes are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,271,060, 5,001,205, 5,236,998 and 5,589,555.<br>
[0089] A preferred process of the invention is where the process, preferably a slurry or gas phase process is operated in the presence of a metallocene catalyst system of the invention and in the absence of or essentially free of any scavengers, such as triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum and tri-n-hexylaluminum and diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl zinc and the like. This preferred process is described in WO 96/08520 and U.S. Patent No. 5,712,352 and 5,763,543. In another preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the process is operated by introducing a benzyl compound into the reactor and/or contacting a benzyl compound with the metallocene catalyst system of the invention prior to its introduction into the reactor.<br><br>
Polymer Product of Embodiments of Invention<br>
[0090] The properties of the polymers were determined by the test methods listed in Table 2 or described herein.<br>
Table 2: Test Methods<br>
(Table Removed ) [0091] Long chain branching index (LCB or g'aVg) and g' are described in United States Patent No. 6,870,010.<br>
[0092] Polymers of the instant invention may have enhanced optical and shrinkage properties, as discussed further below.<br>
[0093] The polymers produced by a process of an embodiment of the invention can be used in a wide variety of products and end-use applications. The polymers produced include linear low-density polyethylene, plastomers, high-density polyethylenes, low-density polyethylene3, polypropylene and polypropylene copolymers. The polymers may be made up of, at least partially, butene, ethylene, and other olefin monomers having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. For instance, the polymers may be copolymers of butene and ethylene, or terpolymers of butene, ethylene, and other olefin monomer.<br>
[0094] The polymers, typically ethylene based polymers, have a density in the range of from 0.90 g/cc to 0.97 g/cc, preferably in the range of from 0.90 g/cc to 0.965 g/cc, more preferably in the range of from 0.90 g/cc to 0.96 g/cc, even more preferably in the range of from 0.905 g/cc to 0.95 g/cc, yet even more preferably in the range from 0.910 g/cc to 0.945 g/cc, and most preferably greater than 0.915 g/cc to about 0.935 g/cc.   The melt strength of the polymers produced using the<br>
catalyst of the invention are preferably greater than 4 cN, preferably greater than 5 cN and, preferably less than 10 cN. For purposes of this patent application and appended claims melt strength is measured with a capillary rheometer (RHEO-TESTER™ 1000, Goettfert, Rock Hill, SC) in conjunction with the Goettfert Rheotens melt strength apparatus (RHEOTENS™ 71.97). A polymer melt strand extruded from the capillary die is gripped between two counter-rotating wheels on the apparatus. The take-up speed is increased at a constant acceleration of 12 mm/sec2, which is controlled by the WinRHEO™ program provided by Goettfert. The maximum pulling force (in the unit of cN) achieved before the strand breaks or starts to show draw-resonance is determined as the melt strength. The temperature of the rheometer is set at 190°C. The barrel has a diameter of 12 mm. The capillary die has a length of 30 mm and a diameter of 2 mm. The polymer melt is extruded from the die at a piston speed of 0.49 mm/sec. The apparent shear rate for the melt in the die is, therefore, 70 sec'1 and the speed at die exit is 17.5 mm/sec. The distance between the die exit and the wheel contact point should be 125 mm.Polymcrs of embodiments of the instant invention have a combination of exceptionally high shear thinning for extrusion, outstanding film optical property and excellent shrink performance. Historically HD-LDPE is the only product family having most of these attributes. However, the clarity of HP-LDPE is far inferior to polymer' cf tmbod.ments of the instant invention. Conventional ZN-LLDPE are lacking oi most of these attributes. Some easy process (i.e., very broad MWD) products from gas phase and/or slurry processes, are typically very poor in optical properties. The shrink property of these conventional products is also somewhat insufficient for shrink application. (C4Hs)Si(CsMe4)(C5H4)ZrMe2 was found to be very effective in reducing the film haze of various LLDPE (especially for a polymer made using (1,3-Me, n-Bu-Cp)2ZrCb as the catalyst and for a polymer made using (C5H4-CH2CH2CH3)2Hf(CH3)2.<br>
[0095] As shown in Figure 2, polymers of embodiments of the instant invention exhibited strain-hardening behavior under the transient uniaxial extensional flow, similar to HP-LDPE. As shown in Table 5, polymers of embodiments of the instant invention have broad MFR (over 100), which is an indicator of good<br>
processability. The films from these products have TD shrinkage comparable to or better than HP-LDPE, optical properties similar to HP-LDPE and dart impact strength significantly better than HP-LDPE and LLDPE. Compared with a high-pressure ethylene polymerization process, a gas phase reactor also has the added benefit of lower cost and, in general, higher capacity.<br>
[0096] The strain hardening at 150°C of Comparative Example A (ExxonMobil LD103.09, from Exxon Mobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX) and Example 5 are respectively shown in Figures 1 and 2. The following two references discuss strain hardening of polyolefins and the test for measuring the same: "Strain hardening of various polyolefins in uniaxial elongational flow", The Society of Rheology, Inc. J. Rheol. 47(3), 619-630 (2003); and "Measuring the transient extensional rheology of polyethylene melts using the SER universal testing platform", The Society of Rheology, Inc. J. Rheol. 49(3), 585-606 (2005).<br>
RETRAMAT Shrink Test<br>
[0097] The RETRAMAT shrink test used herein is based on NFT 54-125 and ASTM D 2838-95, procedure A. Methods DIN 53-369 and ISO/DIS 14616 only cover the shrink force measurement, but do not give guidelines on the simultaneous measurement of shrink percentages. The ASTM method covers the determination of the plastic shrink tension and related shrink characteristics shrink force and orientation release stress of heat-shrinkable film of less than 800 urn thickness, while the specimen is totally restrained from shrinking as it is heated. The NFT 54-125 method covers the total shrinking process, being both the plastic and the thermal shrink process.<br>
[0098] The method used herein consists of exposing two film samples to a given temperature, during a given time, and to cool them down at room temperature, simulating what happens inside a shrinkage installation. For each test sample, a minimum of 10 strips of ± 150 mm length and 15 mm width are prepared for both MD and TD on a sample cutter. Retramat stickers are applied onto the sample edges so that the shrink area of the test specimen measures exactly 100 mm in length.   The oven temperature is 190°C and the closing duration is 45 seconds.<br>
During the test, one of the samples is connected to a force transducer, while the other is connected to a displacement transducer. A thermocouple allows following up the temperature at a few millimetres from the middle of the sample. The 3 parameters (force - displacement - temperature) are continuously displayed on the Retramat and recorded on a lab PC.<br>
[0099] The polymers produced by the process of the invention may have a molecular weight distribution, a weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight (Mw/Mn) of greater than 1.5 to about 15, particularly greater than 2 to about 10, more preferably greater than about 2.5 to less than about 8, and most preferably from 3.0 to 8.<br>
[00100] In one preferred embodiment, the polymers of the present invention have a Mz/Mw of greater than or equal to 3, preferably greater than 3. Mz is the z-average molecular weight.

In yet another preferred embodiment, the Mz/Mw is in the range greater than 3 to less than 4.<br>
[0100] The polymers of the present invention in one embodiment have a melt index (MI) or (I2) as measured by ASTM-D-1238-E in the range from 0.01 dg/min to 1000 dg/min, more preferably from about'0.01 dg/min to about 100 dg/min, even more preferably from about 0.01 dg/min to about 50 dg/min, even more preferably from about 0.01 dg/min to about 10 dg/min, and most preferably from about 0.05 dg/min to about 10 dg/min.<br>
[0101] The polymers of the invention in an embodiment have a melt index ratio (I21/I2) (I2 is measured by ASTM-D-1238-F) equal to or greater than 49.011 x MI(~ °'4304); more preferably equal to or greater than 57.18 x MI('04304); as shown in Figure 3.<br>
[0102] In certain embodiments, the polymers as described herein may have a narrow composition distribution characterized in that the T75-T25 value is lower than 25, preferably lower than 20, more preferably lower than 15, and most preferably lower than 10, wherein T25 is the temperature at which 25% of the eluted polymer is obtained and T75 is the temperature at which 75% of the eluted polymer is obtained in a TREF experiment as described herein. The TREF-LS data reported herein were measured using an analytical size TREF instrument (Polymerchar, Spain), with a column of the following dimension: inner diameter (ID) 7.8 mm and outer diameter (OD) 9.53 mm and a column length of 150 mm. The column was filled with steel beads. 0.5 mL of a 6.4% (w/v) polymer solution in orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB) containing 6 g BHT/4 L were charged onto the column and cooled from 14G°C to 25°C at a constant cooling rate of 1.0 °C/min. Subsequently, ODCB was pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/mm, and the column temperature was increased at a constant heating rate of 2°C/min to elute the polymer.<br>
[0103] As shown below in Table 5, films of embodiments of the invention posses good optical and shrinkage properties. For instance, the films may have one or more of the following properties: an MD plastic shrink tension  60%; a clarity &gt; 60 %; a normalized internal haze 
[0104] The polymers of the invention may be blended and/or coextruded with any other polymer. Non-limiting examples of other polymers include linear low density polyethylenes produced via conventional Ziegler-Natta and/or metallocene catalysis, elastomers, plastomers, high pressure low density polyethylene, high density polyethylenes, polypropylenes and the like.<br>

The reactor was operated at a pressure of 300 psig of which ethylene was 35 mol %. The balance of gas was made up with hydrogen, 1-hexene, and nitrogen as indicated in Table 3.<br>
Table 3. Polymerization conditions<br>
(Table Removed ) Examples 1 and 2<br>
[0116] The polymers of Examples 1 and 2 were prepared from ethylene and butene-1 monomers in a pilot-scale continuous gas phase fluidized bed reactor using CAT A. The reactor was operated at 70°C and 170 psi ethylene partial pressure. The fluidized bed was made up of polymer granules and the average bed weight was approximately 100 to 170 lbs. During the reaction, aluminum distearate was added to the reactor as a 20 wt % slurry in mineral oil at concentrations on a resin basis from 6 and 17 ppmw (parts per million weight). The conditions for making polymers of Examples 1 and 2 are listed in Table 4.<br>
Table 4. Polymerization Conditions of Examples 1 and 2.<br>
(Table Removed ) [0117] The reactor granules of Examples 1 and 2 were dry blended with additives before being compounded on a 2.5" Davis-Standard single-screw extruder equipped with mixing pins and underwater pelletizer at an output rate was<br>
approximately 100 lb/hr. The compounded pellets of examples 1 and 2 were then film extruded on a 2.5" Gloucester line with a 6" oscillating die and an air ring from Future Design Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The output rate was about 150 lbs/hr (8 Ibs/hr-in die circumference) and the die gap was 45 mils. Film gauge was 1 mil and blow up ratio (BUR) varied from 2.5 to 3.5. Frost line height (FLH) was typically 20 to 24". The die temperature was about 199 °C (390 °F).<br>
[0118] Table 5 compares the properties of the polymers of Examples 1 and 2 to the properties of the following reference polymers: Borealis Borstar FB2230 (Borealis A/S, Vienna, Austria). Dow DNDA7340 Cr (The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI). Dow DYNH-1 (The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI). ExxonMobil LD103.09 (from Exxon Mobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX).

Example 3:     CATB<br>
(Table Removed ) [0119] As shown in this example, a polymer of an embodiment of the invention can improve the optical properties of other LLDPE polymers when it is blended in as a minor component. In this example, a polymer of an embodiment of this invention was blended in at 10% (by weight) of the final product using an on-line blending set-up on a Battenfeld Gloucester (Gloucester, MA ) film line. In this set-up, the blend components were weighted separately according to the blend ratio and added to a mixing chamber, where the components were mixed by<br>
agitation before they were discharged into a feed hopper above the extruder. The line was equipped with a 2.5" single screw extruder, a 6" oscillating die and an air ring from Future Design Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The output rate was 151 lbs/hr (8 lbs/hr-in dir circumference) and the die gap was 45 mil. Film gauge was 1 mil and BUR was held constant at 2.5. FLH was typically 20 to 24". The die temperature was 390°F. Table 6 shows these haze improvements for different blends.<br>
Table     6:	Haze     improvements     for     LLDPE     where     10     wt.%<br>
(C4H8)Si(C5Me4)(C5H4)ZrMe2 of catalyzed product was added.<br>
(Table Removed ) [0120] This polymer has a density of 0.9220 grams/cc, an MI (I2) of 0.76 grams/lOmin and a MFR of 99.3. It was made using CAT B under similar conditions as Examples 1 and 2.<br>
[0121] When a polymer of an embodiment of the invention is blended into other LLDPE polymers as a minor component, in addition to the benefit of enhancing the base polymer's optical properties, the polymer also improves their TD tear resistance while largely maintains their MD tear resistance unchanged or causes insignificant or small loss. In contrast, when these LLDPEs are blended with HP-<br>
LDPE to improve optical properties, the loss in toughness is dramatic. Additionally, blending such polymers also improves the extrusion performance of the base polymers, as indicated by the increase in the specific output (Ibs/hp-hr), making the extrusion process more energy efficient.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0122] Polymers were prepared from ethylene (C2) and butene-1 (C4) monomers in a pilot-scale continuous gas phase fluidized bed reactor using (CH2)4Si(C5Me4)(C5H5)ZrMe2 (CAT A). The reactor was operated at temperatures of 70°C and 85°C, and ethylene partial pressures of 170 and 220 psi. The fluidized bed was made up of polymer granules and the average bed weight was approximately 100 to 170 lbs. During the reaction, aluminum distearate was added to the reactor as a 20 wt % slurry in mineral oil at concentrations on a resin basis from 6 and 24 ppmw (parts per million weight). The comonomer concentration in the reactor was changed; its effect on product was recorded, and is shown below in Tables 9 and 9.<br>
[0123] For comparative purpose, a polymer was generated using Me2Si(H4ln)2ZrCl2 as the catalyst. The reactor was operating at 85°C and 220 psi ethylene partial pressure. The comonomer, butene-1, concentration was changed from approximately 1.4 mol.% to approximately 4.6 mol.%, with other process parameters held constant. The melt flow index (MI or I2) of the product only changed from approximately 2.0 to 0.9 g/l0min.<br>

(Table Removed ) [0124]   (CH2)4Si(C5Me4)(C5H5)ZrMe2 (CAT A) was used to produce ethylene (C2)<br>
and butene-1 (C4) copolymer in a pilot-scale continuous gas phase fluidized bed<br>
reactor. The reactor temperature was at 70 °C and reactor ethylene partial pressure<br>
was at approximately 150 psi. The comonomer, butene-1, concentration was<br>
changed from approximately 1.3 mol.% to approximately 0.7 mol.%, with other<br>
process parameters held constant. Results are shown in Table 8.  The melt index<br>
(MI or I2) of the product changed significantly from approximately 5 to 20<br>
g/lOmin.<br>
Table 8. MI change using (CH2)4Si(C5Me4)(C5H5)ZrMe2 (CAT A) as catalyst<br>
(Table Removed ) [0125] This experiment was repeated one more time, also using (CH2)4Si(C5Me4)(C5H5)ZrMe2 (CAT A) as catalyst, but at somewhat different reactor conditions. The reactor temperature was the same at 70°C, but the reactor ethylene partial pressure was at 170 psi and the H2/C2 ratio was at approximately 0.0040. The reactor was steadily making approximately 1.0 (g/lOmin) Melt Index product for extended period of time before the comonomer, butene-1, concentration was changed from approximately 2.0 mol.% to approximately 0.55<br>
mol%, with other process parameters held constant. Results are shown in Table 9. The melt index (MI or I2) of the product changed dramatically from 1.0 to over 100 g/lOmin. This level of change is very significant and unexpected from other metallocene catalysts such as Me2Si(H4In)2ZrCl2 given in the comparative example.<br>

(Table Removed ) Example 5<br>
[0126] When subjected to uniaxial extension, the extensional viscosity of a polymer increases with strain rate. T,he transient uniaxial extensional viscosity of a linear polymer can be predicted as is known to those skilled in the art. Strain hardening occurs when the polymer is subjected uniaxial extension and the transient extensional viscosity increases more than what is predicted from linear viscoelastic theory. The strain hardening index, as herein defined, is the ratio of the observed to the theoretically predicted transient uniaxial extensional viscosity<br>
in the extensional viscosity measurement, i.e. Strain hardening index = E+obS(e = 3) /<br>
