				<td>The present invention relates to a method of packaging for at least one cigarette and a package thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most cigarettes are available in packets of 10 or 20. Cigarette packets are available in various shapes, sizes and also have soft or hard packs. There are also cigarette packs available with a combined lighter or a combined matchbox etc.<br>
It has been observed that in India vast majority of cigarette smokers, and especially those in the rural areas purchase loose cigarettes in denominations of one, two or three etc. Such purchases are made from a cigarette vendor who also stocks other tobacco related products such as 'Pan', 'Gutkha', 'Supari' etc. The vendor keeps open packets of cigarettes and sells the desired quantity to the consumer. The vendor in turn keeps a margin on each cigarette that is sold to the consumer. For example, a pack of 10 cigarettes that costs Rs.30/- when sold individually, is sold at a price of Rs.3.50 per cigarette. Thus the cigarette vendor makes a profit of 0.50 paise per cigarette. In certain cases some vendors even sell a single cigarette at Rs.4/- per cigarette, enjoying a profit of Rs.l/- per cigarette. Thus a cigarette vendor makes a profit between one sixth to one third the cost of the cigarette, when sold loose.<br>
Further, as a cigarette vendor also stocks other tobacco related products and especially Pan that involves the trimming of a leaf, addition of nuts, gutkha or supari on the leaf, rolling or folding the same into a edible size pan. The entire process of making a 'Pan' is done by a vendor using is bare hand. It is a common sight to see such vendors, or 'Panwalas' as they are colloquially referred to, having stained wet and dirty hands, which they then use to remove the desired number of cigarettes from a pack of cigarettes to sell to the customer. The resultant cigarette most often than not is stained, or made wet and dirty.<br>
It has been further observed that the consumer purchasing one or two cigarettes is not generally offered an empty cigarette pack to keep the loose cigarettes. Thus the consumer usually either holds the cigarette in his hands or places them in his shirt or pant pockets. In both cases, the cigarette tends to get damaged, bent and some times even loose some of their tobacco in the users shirt and pant pockets. Another draw back of the situation is that the loosely sold cigarette loses the aroma flavor and potency in its tobacco leaves.<br>
The above situation results in users preferring to buy a pack of 10 or 20 cigarettes or at least 5 cigarettes so that an empty cigarette pack may be obtained for the loosely purchased cigarettes. In other words, a smoker who would prefer to buy one or two cigarettes ends up purchasing a large quantity and eventually starts smoking more cigarettes. As is well known, cigarette smoking is injurious to the health to the smoker and the above scenario only aggravates the situation.<br>
There is therefore, a need for a method of packing cigarettes individually so that the end user or smoker may purchase only those many cigarettes at a time as he desires. There is also a need for such a packaging to have sufficient strength so as to prevent damage to the cigarette and retain the aroma flavor of the cigarette.<br>
It has been attempted previously to package two or three cigars in a package and one such example may be found in US patent 574946.US 5749461 describes an air tight package made of flexible material that is transparent onboth sides and comprises of support numbers that are placed between the cigars to prevent crushing of the cigar during packaging transport and storage.<br>
Similarly, US 2004/0042688, discloses the use of re-closable flexible package that is sealed at regular intervals in between to provide compartments for two or three cigars.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide packaging for a single cigarette while at the same time maintaining the aroma of the cigarette and preventing damage to the cigarette.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a packaging for a single cigarette that is economical and easy to use.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a packaging for a single cigarette that offers increased advertising opportunities.<br>
To meet the aforementioned objectives the invention provides for A method of packaging at least one cigarette comprising the steps of:<br>
placing a cigarette at regular intervals between two flexible sheets of<br>
laminate;<br>
sealing the two sheets along the edges and in between the regularly<br>
spaced cigarettes to form flexible air tight packages; providing a score line in between the flexible air tight packages to form a string of weakly connected packages.<br>
The invention also provides for a flexible airtight package for at least one cigarette, comprising two flexible sheets of laminate sealed along the edges, said package having a notch for easy gripping and a score line to facilitate tearing open the package.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the side perspective view of the packaging of loose cigarettes.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a strip of such packaging and a top perspective of view of the package of figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of the package having two cigarettes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in figure 1, a single cigarette is sealed in a flexible package made up of laminated film. The packages consist of a first laminated film (3) placed below a second laminated film (4) with a single cigarette placed between the two laminated films. All four edges of the two laminated films are sealed so as to provide an airtight package for the cigarette.<br>
These laminated films consist of either 2 or 3 layers of polymeric structure such as polyester, metallized polyester, polyethylene, polyamide, polyurethane, etc.<br>
Figure 2 shows a string of such packages connected to each other by weak line of connection (7). The package as shown is provided with a notch (5) and a partial score line (6) in continuation of the notch. The notch and the score line facilitate easy gripping and tearing of the package to reach the cigarette.<br>
The partial score line may be provided by means of a laser. A laser allows the score line to reach the metallized layer but not penetrate the entire thickness of the package.<br>
One side of the package is kept transparent so that the cigarette may be seen clearly in the package, whereas the other side of the package may be printed with attractive graphics including the cigarette manufacturers name, statutory warning and even a hologram to avoid duplicity. Alternatively, both sides may be printed on or both sides may be transparent depending on the requirement of the manufacturer. The side of<br>
the package on which the printing is to be carried out comprises of a metallized laminate layer placed in between the two or three layers of the laminated film.<br>
The partial score line provided to the package does not penetrate the entire thickness of the laminated film and thus does not compromise the air tight feature of the package while at the same time providing for an ease in opening the package. The score line is provided on the side of the package having the metallized layer such that the score line penetrates up to the metallized layer but not through the entire laminate film. In the case where both sides of the package comprise of a metallized laminate layer, the score line may be provided on either or both sides.<br>
A string of such packages as shown in figure 2 may be provided with a slot (8) or similar structure to facilitate the display of the string of the packages at the vendor premises.<br>
Taking two sheets of flexible laminate that are parallel to each other makes the package in accordance with the invention. At regular intervals a cigarette is placed between the sheets. The two sheets are sealed along the edges and also at regular intervals in between such that airtight packages containing a cigarette are formed at regular intervals along the length of the two sheets of laminate. The sheets of laminate are also given a score line (7) at regular intervals to separate the individually packed cigarettes and form a string of individually packed cigarettes. The result is a string of packages that are sealed at all four edges and are connected to each other by a weak joint in the form of a score line.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the application of the principle of the invention to a package having two or more cigarettes. As shown the package has two cigarettes sealed. The number of cigarettes also depends on the price of each cigarette so that the package may be sold for an easily available denomination of currency.<br>
Though the invention has been described and the accompanying figure illustrate a single cigarette in the package it is within the scope of the invention to provide two or even three cigarettes in such a package.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
