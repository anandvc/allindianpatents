PRODRUGS BUILT AS MULTIPLE SELF-ELIMINATION-RELEASE SPACERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to compounds or prodrugs comprising a multiple release spacer or spacer system. A multiple release spacer is defined as a self-elimination spacer that releases multiple leaving groups upon a single activation event. One or more (generations) of these multiple release spacers can be used for example co obtain conjugates or prodrugs which are activated by a single activation step at the preferred site of action in order to selectively deliver multiple therapeutic or diagnostic parent moieties to target cells or to a target site. In this invention preferably target ceils are tumor cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lack of selectivity of chemotherapeutic agents is a major problem in cancer treatment. Because highly toxic compounds are used in cancer chemotherapy, it is typically associated with severe side effects. Drug concentrations that would completely eradicate the tumor cannot be reached because of dose-limiting side effects such as gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow toxicity. In addition, tumors can develop resistance against anticancer agents after prolonged treatment. In modern drug development, targeting of cytotoxic drugs to the tumor site can be considered one of the primary goals.<br>
A promising approach to obtain selectivity for tumor cells or tumor tissue is to exploit the existence of tumor-associated enzymes, A relatively high level of tumor-specific enzyme can convert a pharmacologically inactive prodrug to the corresponding active parent drug in the vicinity of or inside the tumor. Via this concept a high concentration of toxic anticancer agent can be generated at the tumor site. Ail tumor cells may be killed if the dose is sufficiently high, which may decrease development of drug resistant tumor cells.<br>
There are several enzymes that are present at elevated levels in certain tumor tissues. One example is the enzyme p-glucuronidase, which is liberated from certain necrotic tumor areas. Furthermore, several proteolytic enzymes have been shown to be<br><br>
associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Several proteases, like for example the cathepsins and proteases from the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) system are all involved in tumor metastasis. The serine protease plasmin plays a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis. The proteolytically active form of plasmin is formed from its inactive pro-enzyme form plasminogen by u-PA. The tumor-associated presence of plasmin can be exploited for targeting of plasmin-cleavable conjugates or prodrugs.<br>
An enzyme can also be transported to the vicinity of or inside target cells or target tissue via antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT)1, polymer-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (PDEPT) or macromolecular-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (MDEPT) , virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (VDEPT) or gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) 4.<br>
The technology of this invention relates to novel spacers (linkers) or spacer systems (linker systems) that can be inserted between a specifier (unit that can be cleaved or transformed) and leaving groups (for example parent drugs or detectable molecules). Furthermore, the invention relates to prodrugs and (bio)conjugates comprising a  -specifier, said novel spacers or spacer systems and multiple leaving groups, and to bifunctional linker systems comprising a (protected) specifier containing a reactive moiety that enables coupling to a targeting moiety on one side of the linker (system) and reactive moieties that enable coupling to multiple leaving groups (for example parent drugs or detectable molecules) on the other side of the linker (system). A great number of anticancer conjugates and prodrugs that have been developed in the past contain a self-eliminating connector or linker, also called self-elimination spacer. This spacer is incorporated between, the specifier and the drug in order to facilitate enzymatic cleavage and so enhance the kinetics of drug release (as shown in figure 1). The specifier (which for example can be an oligopeptide substrate for a protease or for example a p-glucuronide substrate for p-glucuronidase) must be site-specifically removed or transformed, followed by a spontaneous spacer elimination to release the cytotoxic parent drug. Up to now self-elimination spacers have been implemented that release one drug molecule upon prodrug activation and subsequent spacer elimination. When the prodrugs and (bio-)conjugates containing multiple drug moieties are<br><br>
considered that have been reported thus far, an independent cleavage was necessary* for each drug molecule to be released.<br>
WO 98/13059 is a relevant disclosure describing a prodrug comprising an amine-terminal capped peptide covalently linked to a therapeutic drug through a self-eliminating spacer. In particular this document describes the use of p-aminobenzy &gt; oxycarbonyl (PABC) as self-eliminating spacer. The PABC electronic cascade spacer was already known from for instance Carl et al, J. Med. Chem., 1981, vol. 2-, -T9-480. Specifically the anticancer drugs doxorubicin, mitomycin C, paciitaxei and camptothecin coupled to PABC are described. A second self-eliminating spacer ;hai is described is p-amino-bis(hydroxymethyl)styrene (BHMS), having the structure p-XK-Ph-CH=C(CH20-)2? including the carbonyl groups the structure isp-NH-Ph -CH-C(CH20CO-)2. It fs rioted that this spacer is described in this disclosure as a bis-carbamate, which teaches that two drug molecules are linked to tins spacer via an amine functionality of the drug. The only drug moiety that is disclosed that is actually coupled to the BHMS spacer is doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is coupled via its sugar amino group resulting in a carbamate linkage between spacer and drug. Further it is stated that the spacer can bind two drug moieties. However, the document is silent on how many drug molecules are actually released.<br>
Other systems that are loaded with multiple covalently bound bioactive molecules as end groups have been reported. Examples are systems that release doxorubicin after acidolysis of each hydrazone linker5, starlike HPMA copolymers containing doxorubicin6, or multi-loadedpoly(ethylene glycol) prodrugs'. A doxorubicin-containing starlike HPMA copolymer with an antibody as the core has also been reported8. A number of recent publications have described the use of branched linkers in combination with antibody-containing prodrugs or bioconjugates with the aim of increasing the number of drugs bound per antibody9. However, to our knowledge, in each multi-loaded prodrug system reported so far, each single tvA group needs to be independently cleaved in order to release all end groups.<br>
Thus there is a need for improved prodrugs or (bio-)conjugates in terms of (efficiency of) release of sufficient amounts of active drug in relation to the activation that is<br><br>
required at a desired site of action. In many cases, in prodrugs or (bio)conjugates, it is desirable to increase drug loading per targeting unit, in order to improve the efficacy of targeted compounds.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention fulfills the above mentioned need with a compound comprising a specifier (V) linked to two or more of the same or different leaving groups (Z) via a self-eliminating multiple release spacer or spacer system, which compound upon a single activation step releases at least two leaving groups, said activation step being the removal or transformation of the specifier. Self-elimination spacers can also be coupled to one another, so that more than one spacer is incorporated between specifier and having group. Hereinbelow, also the term (self-elimination) spacer system is used, which comprises two or more spacers, being either self-eliminating multiple release or single release spacers, connected together.<br>
The present invention also describes bifunctional linker systems comprising a (protected) specifier containing a reactive moiety that enables coupling to a targeting moiety (which then together with the initial specifier becomes a fiinctionalised specifier V) on one side of the spacer (system)._Further, the bifunctional linker systems comprise reactive moieties that enable coupling to multiple leaving groups (for example parent drugs or detectable molecules).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this invention a new technology is disclosed that can -be used to induce release of more than one leaving group following a single activation step. It can be applied for example to prepare prodrugs or conjugates, which can for example be used for targeting drugs to disease-related or organ-specific tissue or cells, for example tumor-specific conjugates or prodrugs that are improved with respect to conjugates or prodrugs known thus far in that they release more than one parent moiety after a single activation step. This aims at a therapeutic advantage. The present invention is deemed to be applicable to all drugs that need to be delivered at a specific target site where a specific disease-related or specifically targeted biomolecule can convert the prodrug or conjugate into drugs or induce conversion of the prodrug or conjugate into drugs. This invention can furthermore fine application in (non-specific) controlled release of compounds, with the aim of enhancing characteristics of parent moiety release.<br>
Ir, another aspect, this invention can find application in a diagnostic assay process. An enzyme can be detected by a compound of this invention containing a multiple release spacer or spacer system that is selectively activated by said enzyme to release multiple detectable molecules (leaving groups), thus increasing the sensitivity of the assay.<br><br>
In this invention, self-elimination multiple release spacers are disclosed that enable release of multiple leaving group molecules upon a single activation event. These self-elimination multiple release spacers are applicable in conjugates or prodrugs, for example anticancer prodrugs, and significantly enhance the amount of drug molecules liberated per (enzymatic) activation, resulting in a potential therapeutic advantage.<br>
In the generic structures throughout this description and in the claims letters are used to define structural elements. Some of these letters can be mistaken to represent an atom, such as C, N, O, P, B, F, 8, V, W, I, Y. To avoid confusion whenever These letters :<: not represent an atom they are given in bold typeface.></:>
In the structures throughout this description and in the claims molecular structures or parts thereof are drawn. As usual in such drawings bonds between atoms are represented by lines, in some cases, to indicate stereochemistry, by bold or. broken or wedged lines. Usually a line ending in space (a "loose" end), i.e. at one end not having another line or specific atom connected to it represents a CH3 group. This is correct for the drawings representing the preferred compounds according to the invention hereinbelow. However for those structures representing a structural element of the compounds according to the invention, in particular A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, T, U and Y, a line ending in space indicates the position of attachment of another structural element of the compound or conjugate. Tins includes attachment to V, S or Z. Also for the drawings representing the preferred structural elements (W-)W(X-)XQ, (W-)w(X-)xC(Dd)c, (W-)w(X-)xC(D(Ee)d)c and (W-)w(X-)xC(D(E(Ff)e)d)c a line ending in space indicates the position of attachment of another structural element of the compound or conjugate, including attachment to V, S or Z. An alternative drawing of a line representing a bond to another structural element would be a drawing of a line with a wavy line perpendicular at the "loose" end of the line.<br>
Furthermore, the structures or parts thereof have been drawn, under the assumption that the structures are read from left to right, meaning that the specifier V is always located on the left side and the leaving groups Z or the reactive moieties S are always located on the right side of such structures.<br><br>
According to the invention, two 'branched self-elimination spacers1, herein also called 'multiple release spacers', have been developed that are able to release multiple moieties. Spacers that are able to release only a single moiety are called 'unbranched spacers' or 'single release' spacers'.<br>
Spacers, either branched or unbranched, which self-eliminate through a l,(4+2n)-elimination (n = 0?L2,3r4.5r6?7,8,9 or 10) (for example 1,6-elimination, 1,8-elimination, or 1,10-elimination) are further called 'electronic cascade' spacers.<br>
When a spacer able to release 2 leaving groups, hereinbelow called "double release spacer", is used between specifier and leaving groups, two leaving group molecules are released per (enzymatic) activation (figure 2a). When a spacer able to release 3 leaving groups, hereinbelow called "triple release spacer", is used, three leaving group molecules will be released per activated compound or prodrug (figure 2b).<br>
When a spacer is connected to one or more other spacers via a direct bond, this combination-of spacers is referred to as 'spacer system'. When at least one of these spacers is a multiple release spacer, it is called a 'multiple release spacer system'.<br>
An aniline-based spacer is a multiple release or single release spacer that comprises an<br>
aromatic amino group on the lefthand side.<br>
A phenol- or thiophenol-based spacer is a multiple release or single release spacer thai<br>
comprises an aromatic hydroxy or thio group, respectively on the lefthand side.<br>
Lefthand side refers to the position in the molecule as shown in e.g. figures 5, 6, 7 and<br>
5.<br>
Surprising!} it was found thai it is required for more than one .leaving group molecule to be released that the leaving groups are not aliphatic amine groups when only an aniline-based multiple release spacer is employed. In other words the leaving groups (Z) should not be coupled to the self-eliminating multiple release spacer via their aliphatic amine groups if the spacer is an aniline-based multiple release spacer. In the examples it is shown that if the leaving group Z is propylamine, p-methoxybenzylamine, benzylamine, or p-chiorobenzylamine, coupled via its primary<br><br>
amine group, maximally one of these leaving groups is actually released (see examples 22, 23,26,27, and 28 / figures 20,21,24, and 25).<br>
When the spacer is a phenol-based or thiophenol-based multiple release spacer or when the multiple release spacer is directly coupled to single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers or spacer systems, however, the leaving groups can also be coupled via their aliphatic amino group as all leaving groups are liberated upon activation.<br>
Preferably the leaving groups Z are linked to the self-eliminating multiple release spacer via a group that possesses sufficient electron-withdrawing capacity, such is for example O, S, aromatic N, or aliphatic N. It is important to note that in the contex; of this invention with aromatic N is meant a nitrogen atom covaiently bound ro an aromatic group such as for instance a (substituted) phenyl ring or other (hetero)aromatic group, but also aromatic N can mean a nitrogen in an aromatic ring such as for instance in a pyrrole ring or in an imidazole ring. As disclosed in this invention, the leaving groups must possess better leaving group capabilities than aliphatic amines when the multiple release spacer is an aniline-based spacer. Propylamine, p-methoxybenzylamine, benzylamine, and even p-chlorobenzylamine did not possess sufficient electron-withdrawing capacity to induce complete release of all end groups when the spacer is an aniline-based spacer. In contrast, benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, paclitaxel, and certain para-substituted aniline derivatives all showed to be completely released from double and triple release spacers disclosed in this invention. For example in case of the herein disclosed double release spacers, when the para-substituted aniline derivative was NH-C6H4-CH2-0-CO-NH-CH:-R, multiple release did not take place. In contrast, when the para-substituted aniline derivative was NH-C6H4-CH=C(CH2-0-CO-2,-0-paclitaxel)2, multiple release did take place. When the multiple release spacer is a phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacer or when the multiple release spacer is coupled to single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers, aliphatic amines are also suitable leaving groups and release of all aliphatic amine leaving groups does occur. This can be reasoned based on the above as aliphatic alcohols prove to be suitable leaving groups (e.g., from H2N-QPL-CH~C(CH2-0-CO-2'-0-paclitaxel)2 two molecules of paclitaxel are released) and therefore release of phenol-based spacers, to which an aliphatic amine leaving group is connected, from a multiple release spacer (e.g., H2N-C6H4-CH=C(CH2-0-C(0)0-CoH4-<br><br>
CH2OC(0)NRIR2)2) should occur by virtue of their increased leaving capability with respect to aliphatic alcohols. As elimination of aliphatic amines from hydroxybenzyl-based spacer-aliphatic amine conjugates is known10, release of aliphatic amines from spacer systems in which the aliphatic amine is directly connected to a phenol-based spacer takes place as well.<br>
The above shows that subtle changes can determine whether multiple release occurs or no;. \Vith all aliphatic amines, and even with certain para-substituted aniline derivatives tested, release of more than one leaving group did not take place when the spacer is an aniline-based spacer, but occurs when the spacer is a phenol- or thiophenol-based spacer, whereas with certain other para-substituted aniline derivatives, and with all hydroxy! leaving groups tested, complete elimination of all end groups did occur independent of the type of spacer used.<br>
For at least two molecules to leave the compound according to the invention the leaving group should be coupJed via its oxygen, such as for example its primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol, its phenok or its phosphate, its sulphur, or its aromatic amine. In order for at leas: two leaving groups that are coupled via their aliphatic amino group to leave from a conjugate comprising one multiple release spacer, the spacer should be a phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacer or the spacer system comprising one aniline-based multiple release spacer should also comprise single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers directly connected to this multiple release spacer. The linkage between self-eliminating multiple release spacer (system) and leaving group can be described as carbonate, alky! phosphate, oxycarbonylthio. carbamate, or N-a:y}-earDa:r.;aie. In some cases, for example in case of an aromatic alcohol leaving group courted to a single release self-elimination spacer via an aryl ether linkage1 \ the leaving group-can also be linked to the spacer without an exvcarbonvl unit withou; comoromisine: self-elimination.<br>
In one embodiment the compound comprises one self-eliminating multiple release spacer, hi a further embodiment the compound comprises two or more self-eliminating multiple release spacers. In yet a further embodiment the compound comprises three or more self-eliminating multiple release spacers.<br><br>
The self-elimination multiple release spacers can also be coupled to one another (figures 3 and 4). In this case compounds are obtained that contain multiple generations of multiple release spacers. If one multiple release spacer is incorporated in :he spacer system of the compound according to the invention, the compound contains one generation of multiple release spacer. If two or mere self-eliminating multiple release spacers are coupled to a first self-eliminating multiple release spacer, the resulting compound contains two generations pf multiple release spacers (second generation . If two or more self-eliminating multiple release spacers are coupled to two or mere multiple release soacers that constitute the second generation self-eliminating mulrtn-ie release spacers, the resulting compound contains three generations of multiple release spacers (third generation). If a compound according to the invention contains wo :r more generations of self-eliminating multiple release spacers, the compound possesses a dendritic (or dendrimeric) structure and can be called a dendrimer. In one embodiment of the invention the compound comprises one self-eliminating multiple release spacer. In a further embodiment of the invention the compound comprises r.vo or more generations of self-eliminating multiple release spacers. In yet a further embodiment the compound comprises three or more generations of self-eliminating multiple release spacers. For instance by coupling two self-elimination double release spacers to a first self-elimination double release spacer and optionally again coupling of four self-elimination double release spacers to the second two self-elimination double release spacers, a dendritic structure is constructed. The number of leaving group molecules, for example drug molecules, that can be bound per specifier is multiplied with every generation of self-elimination multiple release spacers incorporated. Each new generation of self-elimination multiple release spacers that is coupled to the preceding generation multiplies the number of leaving group molecules that can eventually be present in the compound or conjugate by a factor that is equal to the number of leaving groups that can be bound to the multiple release spacer of the generation that is newly incorporated. The final compound or prodrug (or bioconjugate) that is obtained is a dendrimer.<br>
Thus in a further embodiment of the invention the compound comprises a self-eliminating multiple release spacer system in the form of a dendritic structure.<br><br>
For at least two molecules to leave such a dendritic multiple release spacer system, the leaving groups should be coupled via their oxygen, such as for example their primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol their phenol, or their phosphate, their sulphur, or their aromatic amine. In order for at least two leaving groups that are coupled via their aliphatic amino group to leave, at least one generation of the dendritic multiple release spacer system should comprise phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacers or should be coupled to the next generation of multiple release spacers or to the leaving groups via single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers . Preferably the highest generation of multiple release spacers or spacer systems should be phenol- or thiophenol-based.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, when an aniline-, phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacer (system) is used, the leaving groups are not aliphatic amines, but preferably for example C\ S or aromatic N.<br>
Dendrimers, also known as siarburst polymers, are well-defined highly branched tree-like macromolecuies with a large number of end groups \ One application of dendrimeric (or dendritic) structures that has been explored is drug delivery ". In the emersine field of dendrimeric drug delivery, biologically active substances can be covalently linked 10 dendrimeric end groups, or can be encapsulated inside dendrimers. In the examples of the first case that have been reported thus far, each drug molecule must be independently liberated via a chemical or biological cleavage step1*. In the second case, specific physiological conditions need to change the folding and/or tertiary structure o:"the dendrimen thereby releasing encapsulated material. Release of active substances from dendrimers can be induced by pH \ incorporation of photosensitive units115, or by enz)Tnatic cleavage1'.<br>
Tiie novel self-elimination multiple release spacers disclosed herein enable complete release of multiple leaving groups, for example biologically active substances, that are covalently linked to the dendrimeric end groups in such a way that a single activation is sufficient to release all end groups (figures 3 and 4). A single chemical or biological activating event should lead to a cascade of self-elimination reactions thereby releasing multiple leaving groups. Dendrimers with these properties may be useful for several<br><br>
applications, and are considered particularly useful in the area of diagnostics and the area of drug delivery, for example in anticancer therapy, where tumor-selective degradation of the dendrimeric material is desired. Multiple drug molecules can be site-specifically released by employment of only one targeting or drag delivery device. Compounds -hat contain two or more generations of multiple release self-elimination spacers, optionally connected to each other via single release spacers or spacer systems are further called 'cascade dendrimers'.<br>
Several applications are imaginable for the multiple release spacers or soacer systems or cascade dendrimers of this invention. Firstly, bioactive compounds can be site-specifically delivered. The concept can be applied to anticancer agents, but also antibiotics can be incorporated as end groups in a cascade dendrimer that is activated for example by bacterial enzymes, such as for example {3-lactamase. In addition. cascade dendrimers may be applicable in the agrochemical field for release of<br>
1 Q<br>
pesticides  . Through sophisticated synthesis, cascade dendrimers may be prepared that contain two or more different parent compounds. This may be interesting when it is considered that combination therapy emerges as a clinically important mode of treatment for diseases such as cancer, bacterial diseases, and HIV.<br>
Furthermore, biodegradable dendrimers might be interesting for the production of biodegradable materials such as plastics, or may be used as devices that enable the controlled or slow release of drugs by incorporation of, for example, an enzymatically degradable sequence. In addition, cascade dendrimers may be used for diagnostic purposes19. They could serve as an amplification mechanism in diagnostic assays, see hereinbelow.<br>
Several strategies have evolved to improve the specificity of anticancer drugs, the prodrug concept being one of them20,21. A prodrug is an inactive derivative of an active drug, which is site-specifically activated to release the active parent drug. Prodrugs that are activated by tumor-specific or tumor-targeted enzymes have shown promising results22. Alternatively, prodrugs of antitumor agents coupled to polymers, as already reported by Ringsdorf23, provide another targeting principle. Polymers, including dendrimers, can passively lead to tumor-specificity, due to the enhanced permeability<br><br>
and retention effect (EPR"/4. This effect retains polymeric material with an approximate molecular weight &gt; 40 kD inside tumor tissue due to discontinuous (leaky) and poorly formed tumor endothelium and poor lymphatic drainage. Frequently used polymeric carriers for d^dg deliver}' arepo]y[N-(24iydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (poly-HPMA)*~, poly-glutamic acid, for example poly-L-glutamic acid (PG), and<br>
Of<br>
poly (ethylene) glycol (PEG)   . Application of dendrimers in drug delivery can be preferred to other polymers because, by definition, dendrimers are not as polydisperse as conventional polymers. In general, they can be obtained as homogeneous compounds more easily than polymers, a fact that may facilitate approval of dendrimeric material for medicinal purposes.<br>
An important advantage of cascade dendrimers over conventional dendrimers or polymers would be that they would be selectively degradable, thus clearable from the body. Clearance of polymers from the body is a limiting factor in current polymeric drag delivery systems, as the maximum molecular weight of synthetic macromolecules thai can be cleared from the body ranges from 25 to 45 kD  . Cascade dendrimers as<br>
disclosed herein can be considered as an alternative for self-assembling dendrimeric<br>
it systems'" thai also possess these desirable properties of degradability.<br>
Thus, the multiple release dendrimeric conjugates and prodrugs of this invention containing covaiently bound anticancer drug molecules as end groups and activated by a specific enzyme that is localized in the tumor environment or by any other specific chemical or biological evem would combine a number of desirable properties for a tumor-selective anticancer compound<br>

According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the l,(4+2n) electronic cascade spacers W and X are independently selected from compounds having the formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5; R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent H, C{.6 alkyl, C3_ 20 heterocyclyl, C5-20 aryl, Ci-6 alkoxy, hydroxy (OH), amino (NH2), mono-substituted amino (NRXH), di-substituted amino (NRxlRx2), nitro (N02), halogen, CF3, CN, CONH2, S02Me, CONHMe, cyclic C1-5 alkylamino, imidazolyl, Ci-6 alkylpiperazinyl, morpholino, thiol (SH), thioether (SRX), tetrazole, carboxy (COOH), carboxylate (COORx), sulphoxy (S(=0)2OH), sulphonate (S(=0)2ORx), sulphonyl (S(=0)2Rx)? sulphixy (S(=0)OH), sulphinate (S(=0)ORx), sulphinyl (S(=0)Rx), phosphonooxy (OP(=0)(OH)2), and phosphate (OP(=0)(ORx)2), where Rx, Rx] and Rx2 are independently selected from a Ci_6 alkyl group, a C3_2o heterocyclyl group or a C5.20 aryl group, two or more of the substituents Rl, R2,'R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, or R9 optionally being connected" to one another to form one or more aliphatic or aromatic cyclic structures.<br><br>
Ill a preferred embodiment leaving groups Z are linked to the self-eliminating multiple release spacer or spacer system via an O, S or aromatic N of the leaving group.<br>
Ln order to further clarify the above mentioned formulae, compound 26 depicted in figure 13 will serve as an example. This compound is a compound of the formula V-(W-)w(X-)xC(D((A-)aZ)d)c. It contains two generations of double release spacers, to which 4 end groups Z have been coupled. The specifier V is [O], which means that V-B is an oxidized form of B (part of C). Reduction of this functionality induces self-eiimination. Such moiety V-B can be chemically reduced, but it can also be reduced under physiological conditions under hypoxic conditions, or by a nitroreductase. Z is paclitaxei. No single release spacer is incorporated in between the specifier [O] and the multiple release spacers, which means that w = x = 0. C is the double release spacer containing the benzylidene-propane-l,3-bis-oxycarbonyl unit, which eliminates according to the principle depicted in figure 8. No cyclization elimination spacer is present, which means that a = 0. Because two double release spacers have been coupled to the first double release spacer, d = c = 2.<br>
In general, multiple release spacers disclosed in this invention possess multiple release characteristics because they are branched on two levels; i) branching on the aromatic ring where both ortho and para-substituents with respect to the location of the specifier can be introduced, and ii) branching by incorporation of additional conjugated double bonds a* para and'or ortho positions of the aromatic rines. where the tenninal C-atom of the double bond provides a branching point where two leaving groups can be attached. Theoretically, these two elements for branching self-eliminating spacers to obtain multiple release spacers or spacer systems can be infinitely extended.<br>
In addition to incorporation of one or more (generations of) self-eliminating multiple release spacers, it may also be desirable to incorporate a single release, also called unbranchsd. self-eliminating spacer or spacer system in between the specifier and the first multiple release spacer. This may facilitate the activation step. This single release self-eliminating spacer or spacer system is described by -(W-)W(X-)X. Furthermore, it may be desirable to add single release self-eliminating spacers or spacer systems to a previous generation, coupled to a next generation of multiple release spacers (thus<br><br>
obtaining a previous generation of multiple release spacer systems), or to the highest generation of multiple release spacer(s) before leaving groups Z in order to increase the surface area of the final conjugate. This may increase the number of end groups that can be accommodated and it may also increase the final size of the conjugate, which &gt;      may go together with certain advantages, such as for example benefiting from :he Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, when only aniline-based multiple release spacers are used, connection of single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers to a generation of multiple release spacers or, preferably. :o the highest generation of multiple release spacers before leaving groups Z enables :he release of two or more leaving groups Z that are coupled with their aliphatic amino group to the multiple release spacer system.<br>
When only aniline-based multiple release spacers are used and no single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers are incorporated into the multiple release spacer system to which leaving groups Z are coupled with their aliphatic amino group only 1 Z group will be released. This is also true for incorporation of single release aniline- -based spacer(s) in the multiple release spacer system to which leaving groups Z are coupled with their aliphatic amino group. Single release spacers that are added to a generation of multiple release spacers, or to the highest generation of multiple release spacer(s) before leaving groups Z or reactive moieties S are represented in the above formulae by -(W-)W(X-)X in P, which is a part of C, D, £, and F.<br>
In general, aniline-based single release or multiple release spacers are preferred over phenol- or thiophenol-based single release or multiple release spacers. The above shows, however that it might sometimes be beneficial to include phenol- or thiophenol-based single release spacer in the multiple release spacer system. For the same reason, it is sometimes beneficial to include phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacers. In general, to release two or more Z groups that are connected to the multiple release spacer or spacer system via an aliphatic amino group, at least one, preferably all, multiple release spacers or spacer systems of either generation C, D (if present), E (if present), or F (if present), preferably the one(s) connected to either A, Z, or S, have to be phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacers or spacer systems, meaning<br><br>
i) B = 0 or S for at least one, preferably all, multiple release spacers in that generation,<br>
or<br>
ii) when B = N for all multiple release spacers in said generation, at least one single<br>
release spacer is connected to at least two branches of at least one, preferably all.<br>
multiple release spacer in said generation, and B = O or S for at least two of those<br>
single release spacers.<br>
In the formulae above, Q is preferably O-CO, but it may also have no meaning. For example, a compound with an aryl ether linkage between self-elimination spacer and leaving group, where the oxycarbonyl function is lacking (Q has no meaning), has been reported to undergo self-elimination as well11.<br>
The principle of 1,6-elimination, as such developed by Carl et al. in 1981, can be considered one of the most versatile self-elimination principles that can be used in prodrug design. According to this principle, spacer elimination proceeds via the mechanism depicted in figure 5. This particular elimination process has proven to be very successful when applied in the prodrug concept. Spacers that self-eliminate through an electronic cascade sequence as indicated in figures 5 and 6 generally show much faster half-lives of elimination than do spacers that eliminate via a cyclization reaction. This is a significan; difference between cyclization spacers and electronic cascade spacers.<br>
Elongated self-elimination spacers can be incorporated between a cleavable moiety and leaving group, for example between specifier and drug as disclosed in WO 02/0831 SO (see also ref. 29). Increasing the length of self-elimination spacers may have (an) additional advantage(s). Self-elimination spacers with increased length may increase the rate and/or efficiency of activation of conjugate or prodrug. As a result drug release characteristics may be enhanced through long spacers. The self-elimination spacers or spacer systems of the present invention can also be longer than conventional self-elimination spacers, such as for example the 1,6-elimination spacer, because they are elongated themselves or because multiple self-elimination linkers are combined within one multiple release spacer system. Thus, the spacers or spacer systems of the present invention can be branched, but in addition they can be elongated. Both factors (length<br><br>
and degree of branching) of a spacer or spacer system must be carefully considered when designing conjugates or prodrugs. A high degree of branching may be disadvantageous for the efficiency of activation of the conjugate or prodrug, especially.. when the branching points are in close proximity to the site of activation. When a high degree of brandling is desirable in order to accommodate many leaving groups Z. it may be beneficial to incorporate single release self-elimination spacers in between the specifier V and the branching point(s). It may increase the efficiency of activation.<br>
Connection of single release spacer) s) to generations of multiple release spacers may enable an increase of the total number of end groups that can be incorporated because the surface of the outer sphere is increased by incorporation of additional single release spacer(s), and as a result more end groups (for example drags) can be accommodated. To obtain a conjugate or prodrug that possesses the desired properties, a c cnsiu.wi eo. choice of a specific multiple release spacer or spacer system optionally including one or more single release self-elimination spacers, must be made.<br>
The novel self-eliminating multiple release spacers disclosed in this invention muv oe coupled to one another to yield multiple release spacer systems in which the spacers are coupled through aryl-carbamate functions, by employing hydroxybenzotriazoie as a catalyst to couple an aromatic amine to a p-nitrophenyl carbonate.<br>

The oo-amino group of the ©-amino aminocarbonyl cyclization spacer should possess sufficient leaving group ability.

In a further embodiment the compounds depicted in the previous paragraph further comprise co-amino aminocarbonyl cyclization spacers A.<br>
The invention also relates to the self-eliminating multiple release spacers or spacer systems per se as described in this invention. The invention thus relates to compounds as defined above without specifier V and with Z or S is H or OH, exemplified by for instance aminotriol 16 (fig 11) and aminodiol 23 (fig 13), extending to spacer systems comprising more than one spacer.<br>
Also the invention relates to derivatives of the self-eliminating multiple release spacers or spacer systems per se that can be used for facilitating coupling with specifiers, leaving groups, reactive moieties or spacers. For instance an amino group may be derivatized as its isocyanate and an alcohol group may be derivatized as its p-nitrophenyl carbonate. Other derivatizations are well within the knowledge of the sidlied person.<br>
One end of the spacer or spacer system must be able to react with the specifier, for example the tripepride that is a substrate for plasmin. Typically, this end of the spacer or spacer system is an amino group or a hydroxyl group, but it can also be another functionality- The functionalities at the other end of the linker or linker system must be able 10 react with the leaving group Z (the drug). Typically, these ends of the multiple release spacer or spacer system are hydroxyl groups, but they can also be other functionalities, ha one embodiment, these functionalities react with the hydroxyl group : f the drug to form for example carbonate linkages between linker and drug. In another embodiment, these functionalities react with the aromatic amino group of the drug to form for example N-aryl carbamate linkages between linker and drug. In again another embodiment these functio:u:Ii:ies react with the sulfhydryl group of the drug to form for example oxycarbonylthic linkages between linker and drug. In again another embodiment these functionalities react with the carboxylic acid group of the drug. If<br><br>
spacers A are included in the spacer system, typically the hydroxyl group of the drug is reacted with A to form carbamate linkages between A and Z.<br>
In the compounds of the invention the specifier V typically contains a substrate molecule that is specifically cleaved by an enzyme present in the vicinity of or inside the target cells, for example tumor cells. More preferably, the specifier V contains a substrate that is specifically cleaved by an enzyme present at elevated levels in the vicinity of or inside the target cells as compared to other parts of the body, and most preferably the enzyme is present only in the vicinity of or inside fne target ceils. In an embodiment suitably the specifier V constitutes a targeting moiety in order to target the compounds to specific cells.<br>
In the compounds of the invention, the specifier V may also contain a reactive moiety that can react with a targeting moiety that can target the resulting compounds to the target site by selective binding to a receptor or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population or by causing accumulation of the compounds of the invention in the vicinity of or inside the target cells by another mechanism. In case these compounds contain two or more reactive moieties S, the compounds are from hereon called "bifunctional linkers". When the compounds comprise two or more moieties Z, the compounds are from hereon called "monofunctional spacer-leaving group conjugates". Both bifunctional linkers and mono functional spacer-leaving group conjugates can be used to prepare prodrugs of the present invention that contain a specifier with a targeting group as well as a substrate specifically cleavable at the target site, a multiple release spacer system and two or more leaving groups Z. Although in this invention spacers and spacer systems are described that are able to release multiple leaving groups, it is obvious that mono functional spacer-leaving group conjugates and bifunctional linkers can also be designed that contain single release spacers and spacer systems, such as for example described in WO 02/83180 and EP 1243276, which are incorporated by reference.<br>

The specifier V may also contain a moiety that targets the compounds of the invention to the target site by selective binding to a receptor or other receptive moiety associated<br><br>
with a given target cell population or by causing accumulation of the compounds of the invention in the vicinity of or inside the target cells by another mechanism. This targeting moiety may, for example, be bombesin, transferrin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, a molecule that specifically binds ccvf33 and/or ccvPs-mtegrin receptors, such as RGD-containing peptides, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, a tumor growth factor, vaccinia growth factor, insulin and insulin-like growth factors I en II. an antigen-recognizing immunoglobulin or an antigen-recognizing fragment thereof or a carbohydrate. Preferably, that antigen recognized by the immunoglobulin (or fragment thereof) is specific for the target cells, e.g. a tumor-specific antigen.<br>
In one embodiment, the specifier V contains a di«, tri-, or oligopeptide which consists of an amino acid sequence specifically recognized and thus cleavable by a protease, for example plasmin, a cathepsin, cathepsin B, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), or a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases, present in the vicinity of or inside the target cells, for example tumor cells.

In again another embodiment the specifier is [G], yielding for example a nitro group that can be reduced under hypoxic conditions or by nitroreductases. In another embodiment V is a nitro-(hetero)aromatic moiety, for example nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl. I After reduction of the nitro group or removal of the nitro-aromatic specifier, elimination of the spacers or spacer systems described in this invention leads to drug release. It can be understood that any specifier that is specifically cleaved following recognition by a disease-specific and/or organ-specific and/or specifically targeted enzyme and/or receptor can be incorporated into conjugates and prodrugs that contain - -the spacers or spacer systems claimed in this invention.<br>
In one embodiment the invention relates to a compound wherein the specifier V contains a tripeptide. Preferably the tripeptide is linked via its C-terminus to the self-<br><br>

More preferably the C-terminal amino acid residue of the tripeptide is selected from arginine and lysine, the middle amino acid residue of the tripeptide is selected from alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, cyclohexylglycine, tryptophan and proline, and the N-tenninal amino acid residue of the tripeptide is selected from a D-amino acid residue and a protected L-amino acid residue including protected glycine.<br>

It should be noted that specifier V, either in the form of a di-, tri-or oligopeptide, or in an\' other form, may contain protective groups. Such compounds comprising protected specifier V may not, when contacted with for instance specifier specific enzymes, release the leaving groups.

The moiety Z is preferably a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety, but ir can also be a hydrogen or OH group or a reactive moiety. A H or OH group or a reactive moiety maybe accidentally introduced in a final conjugate during its synthesis, in case final coupling of leaving groups to the multiple release spacer or spacer system does not proceed completely. H or OH groups will not act as leaving group, but are not expected to inhibit elimination of leaving groups Z.<br>

The motet}- S is a reactive moiety that enables coupling of moieties Z to the multiple release spacer (system). When the moiety S is connected via a carbonyl group to the multiple release spacer or spacer system, suitable S moieties include, without limitation, 7V-succinimidyl-d\ -oxide, p-nitrophenoxide, pentafluorophenoxide,<br><br>
carboxylates, halides, and sulfonates. When the moiety S is directly connected to the methylene group of the multiple release spacer system, suitable S moieties include. without limitation, halides and sulfonates. The moiety S mav also be H or OH, in which case coupling to Z occurs by in situ conversion of S to a reactive moiety which is then substituted by Z in the same reaction mixture.<br>
The compounds of the invention that contain two or more moieties S can be used :o prepare the compounds of the invention that contain two or more moieties Z. When die compounds of the invention that contain two or more moieties 5 contain a specifier v that also contains a reactive moiety, the compounds have been named hifunciional linkers. When the compounds of the invention that contain two or mors moieties S contain a specifier V that does not contain a reactive moiety, the compounds are from hereon called "monofunctional specifier-spacer conjugates". Although in this invention spacers and spacer systems are described that are able to release multiple leaving groups, it is obvious that monofunctional specifier-spacer conjugates and Afunctional linkers can also be designed that contain single release spacers and spacer systems, such as for example described in WO 02/S3180 and EP 1243276, which are incorporated by reference.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and salts thereof.<br>
A compound consisting of an ammo-terminal capped peptide covalently linked via one singlep-NH-Ph-CH=C(CH2OCO-): spacer to two doxorubicin molecules is excluded from the scope of this invention. Further compounds consisting of an ammo-terminal capped peptide covalently linked via one single/7-NH-Ph -CHK^CrLOCO-): spacer to two anticancer drug molecules may or may not be excluded from the scope of this invention.<br>
When an enzyme needs to be quantitatively detected, incorporation of a multiple release spacer or spacer system into a compound or conjugate that is enzymatic ally cleaved by said enzyme increases the sensitivity of such an assay as one enzymatic cleavage can liberate numerous detectable molecules.<br>
Detection or determination of an enzyme, for example a protease, in a sample can be performed by incubating the sample with a compound containing a multiple release spacer or spacer system according to this invention, which is a substrate for the (proteolytic) enzyme, and observing (proteolytic) cleavage of said substrate. The phrase "determining an enzyme" means both qualitative analysis, i.e. detecting the presence of the enzyme, determining whether it is present, and quantitative analysis, i.e. quantifying the enzyme, determining the enzyme activity present in the sample.<br>
For many proteases chromogenic or fluorogenic peptide substrates have been devised which are often commercially available. In many cases, for example in case of serine proteases, the enzymes do not recognize the sequence which is C-terminal to the hydrolyzed bond. This part can be replaced by a chromogenic or fluorogenic leaving group like p-nitroaniline or P-naphtylamine. Such chromogenic or fluorogenic compounds can serve as leaving group Z in compounds of the present invention. The<br><br>
multiple release spacer or spacer system may increase the sensitivity that can be obtained for detection and quantification of physiological concentrations of enzymes in -biological fluids or tissue-extracts.<br>
An enzyme can also be indirectly determined via its pro-enzyme containing a recognition site, e.g., an activation site, cleavable by said enzyme to be determined. Cleavage of the pro-enzyme can in such case be detected by observing the resulting activity using a suitable substrate of the activated pro-enzyme, the substrate containing a multiple release spacer or spacer system of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment the invention relates to a diagnostic assay process in which a compound according to the invention is used.<br>
In a further embodiment the invention relates to a process in which the presence or amount of an enzyme is determined by using a compound according to the invention.<br>
In yet a further embodiment the invention relates to a process in which the presence or amoun: of a protease is determined by using a compound according to the invention.<br>
In a further embodiment the invention relates to a process in which the compound according to the invention that is used comprises a substrate for said protease and leaving group Z is detected.<br>
In ye: a further emboaimen; the invention relates to a process in which the compound according to the invenrioi; that is used comprises a substrate for an enzyme, which is the product of cleavage of its pro-enzyme precursor by said protease and .leaving group Z is detected.<br>
The specifier V may also comprise a polymer, such as for example poly[N-(2-hydroxy-propyl jmethacryiainide] (poiy-HPMA), poly-glutamic acid (poly-L-glutamic acid (?G)), or poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG), which causes accumulation of compounds of the invention in the vicinity of or inside the target cells, e.g. tumor cells, because of the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. These polymers may as such be<br><br>
regarded as a targeting moiety. Two or more molecules of the invention may also be coupled to a central (core) monomeric or polymeric molecule to obtain a larger structure that could accumulate as a result of the EPR effect, in addition to other mechanisms of accumulation. Suitable polymers are for example ?oIy[N-(2-hydroxy-propyl)methacrylamide] (poly-HPMA), poly-glutamic acid (poly-L-giutamic acid (PG)), or poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG). Thus the invention also relates to a composite structure comprising two or more compounds according to the invention, connected with a polymeric structure.<br>
Structures of multiple release spacers are disclosed that can serve as suitable monomers to construct the multiple release dendrimeric prodrugs or (bio)conjugates. A suitable monomer is able to release 2 or more leaving groups after activation. One herein disclosed structure of such multiple release monomer is depicted in figure 7. Triple release from this monomer, as depicted in figure 7, is based CA\ the principles of unbranched 1,4- and 1,6-elimination spacers   . After unmajsicing of the amine of 1 (figure 7), 2 can undergo an electronic cascade reaction, after which the reactive non-aromatic species 3 is immediately trapped by a nucleophile, such as for example water, to regenerate the aromatic amine function in 4. This process of self-elimination and trapping is repeated two more times, after which three leaving groups L-H have been liberated. The sequence in which the three electronic cascade elimination reactions take place as depicted in figure 7 was chosen randomly, hi fact, the three fragmentations (two 1,4-eliminations and one 1,6-elimination) may occur in any random order. Employing n generations of this monomer, cascade dendrimers can potentially be constructed that contain 3n end groups.<br>
Figure 8 depicts the principle of drug release from a double release spacer. Self-elimination of this double release spacer is based on I,S-eliminarion. Deprotection o: the amino group in 7, affording 8, sets the stage for 2 1,8-elimination reactions releasing 2 leaving groups L-H.<br>
An amine or hydroxylamine can be generated from a masked amine through reduction of a nitro function to the corresponding hydroxylamine or amine function. Both the hydroxylamine and the amine derivatives induce self-elimination of the spacer.<br><br>
To deliver proof of principle for multiple release of leaving groups from conjugates and  -prodrugs containing a multiple release spacer or spacer system as disclosed herein, compounds were synthezised that contain multiple leaving groups coupled as end groups to one or two generations of multiple release spacers. These compounds were to release the leaving groups upon reduction of the nitro group attached to the aromatic ring at the center of the multiple release linker or linker system. Reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine or amine should trigger the multiple release cascade and simultaneous!}' liberate all leaving groups. Alternatively, removal of an Aloe protecting group to unmask the amine can trigger self-elimination. In addition to serving as compounds to deliver proof of principle, the synthesized nitroaromatic compounds that contain antitumor drugs, such as paclitaxel, as leaving groups can be considered for application in selective drug targeting to hypoxic areas in tumors, where the nitro group will be reduced. Alternatively, these compounds can be used as conjugates and prodrugs that are activated by nitroreductases which are targeted to tumor cells through one of the directed enzyme prodrug therapy (DEPT) approaches. The synthesis of these compounds is disclosed.<br>
The triple release building blocks nitrotriol 11 (figure 9) and aminotrio] 16 (figure 11) can be synthesized following a number of routes. Several approaches to obtain the corresponding amino-tri-methylester or amino-tri-carboxylic acid have been reported<br>
■a i<br>
starting from for example rdtromesitylene   .<br>
Synthesis of the coubie release building block nitrodiol 20 (figure 12) has been reported in the liieraiure"*  7ne double release building block aminodiol 23 (figure I?) can be s)Tithesized by reduction of the nitro group of 2-p-nitrobenzylidene propane-1,3-<br>
Proof of principle of irink release should be delivered with amonomeric model compound with a structure similar to 1 (figure 7). To obtain such a compound, nitrotriol 11 was activated with excess p-mtrophenyl chloroformate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and pyridine to yield triply activated compound 12 (figure 9).   Triply activated 12 was subsequently reacted with benzyl alcohol to yield<br><br>
model compound 13, or with phenethyl alcohol to yield model compound 14. Triply-activated 12 was also reacted with benzylamine to obtain model compound 15 (figure 10).<br>
In order to obtain model compound 19 (figure i 1), aminotriol 16 was N-protected wirh an Aloe group to yield 17, subsequently triply activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate to yield 18, and coupled with propylamine.<br>
Proof of principle for the fact that the dual release spacer with a structure similar to 10 (figure 8) can indeed release both leaving groups is also disclosed in diis invention. 7cr this purpose, nitrodiol 20 was doubly activated with excess p-mrropbeny ■ chloroformate in the presence of diisopropylethytamine (DIPEA) and pyridine to yield doubly activated compound 21 (figure 12). Doubly activated 21 was subsequently reacted with paclitaxel to yield the desired model compound 22,<br>
In addition to delivering proof of principle for double release from a spacer with a structure similar to 10 (figure 8), a model compound was synthesized for delivering proof of principle for release of 4 leaving groups from a multiple release prodrug or (bio)conjugate containing 2 generations of double release spacers. For this purpose, two molecules of aminodioi 23 were coupled to doubly activated 21 using HOBt as a catalyst to yield tetraoi 24 (figure 13). Tetraol 24 was quadruply activated with excess p-nitrophenyl chloroformate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and pyridine to yield quadruply activated compound 25. Quadruply activated 25 was subsequently reacted with paclitaxel to yield the desired model compound 26.<br>
Doubly activated 21 was also reacted with benzylamine to yield model compound 27 (figure 14). To synthesize additional model compounds, doubly activated 21 was also reacted with the single release 1,6-eIimination spacer to yield 28 (figure 15), which was subsequently activated using p-nitrophenyl chloroformate to yield 29. Doubly activated 29 was reacted with p-methoxybenzylamine, p-chlorobenzylamine, or phenethyl alcohol, to yield model compounds 30, 31, and 32, respectively (-figure 16).<br><br>
To obtain a reference compound for demonstration of single 1,6-eliniination, p-nitrobenzyl cliioroforaiate 33 was reacted with benzylamine to yield model compound 34 (figure 17).<br>
Two other reference compounds were also prepared (figure 18). Dibenzyl carbonate 35 and 2?-0-cinnamyloxycarbonylpaclitaxel 36 were synthesized as reference compounds to demonstrate that these compounds remain intact upon treatment with conditions that are necessary for reduction of the nitro function of the model compounds described above.<br>
Although the conjugates, test compounds, and reference compounds are based on aniline-based spacers, it is obvious to one skilled in the art that similar compounds containing one or more phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers can be prepared analogously.<br>
In order to deliver proof of principle for release of all three leaving groups, 13 and 14 were unmasked by reduction of the nitro group using zinc in the presence of acetic acid (figure 19). Within one hour thin layer chromatography indicated complete disappearance of starting compound and formation of a substantial amount of benzyl alcohol or phen ethyl alcohol. NMR spectra of the products indicated complete formation of free benzyl alcohol or phenethyl alcohol, no signals from benzyl carbonate or phenethyl carbonate protons being present.<br>
V'Tien the nitro fundi or; o* model compound 15 was reduced (figure 20). thin layer chromatography indicated formation of a single product. However, formation of benzylamine was not or hardly observed. According to NMR, maximally 33 percent of<br>
benzylamine was releasee :rom 15.<br>
Treatment of the mode] compound 19 (figure 21) with<br>
palladiimitelraldstriphenylphosphine and morpholine resulted in disappearance of starting compound within one hour. However, again no complete release of propylamine was observed.<br><br>
In order to deliver proof of principle for release of both paclitaxel leaving groups, 22 was unmasked by reduction of the nitro group using zinc in the presence of acetic acid (figure 22). Within 30 minutes thin layer chromatography indicated complete disappearance of starting compound and formation of a substantial amount of paclitaxel. An NMR spectrum of the product indicated complete formation of free paclitaxel, no signals from paclitaxel-2'-carbonate protons were present.<br>
A similar reduction of the nitro group of the model compound 26, containing 2 generations of multiple release spacers and containing 4 paclitaxel units, led to complete disappearance of starting material within 30 minutes and a substantial amount of paclitaxel was formed according to thin layer chromatography (figure 23). Also in this case, an NMR spectrum of the product indicated complete formation of free paclitaxel.<br>
Treatment of model compound 27, containing benzylamine as leaving groups (figure 24), with zinc showed disappearance of starting compound. However, again no complete release of benzylamine was observed.<br>
Also model compounds 30 and 31, containing aliphatic amine leaving groups (p-methoxybenzylamine or p-chlorobenzylamine), were reduced. In both cases, within 30 min, the starting compound was converted into a single product, however, again no free amine was formed.<br>
When the phenethyl alcohol leaving group containing compound 32 was reduced under the same conditions, the product showed to be completely converted into free phenethyl alcohol, as observed by lH-NMR..<br>
To verify whether the single release single release 1,6-elimination spacer self-eliminates when the leaving group is an aliphatic amine, compound 34 was reduced. NMR indicated complete release of benzylamine.<br>
The reference compounds 35 and 36 were also treated with zinc and acetic acid (figure 28). According to XH-NMR both compounds did not show any degradation, which<br><br>
demonstrates that the liberation of leaving groups from the nitro-containing model compounds is not due to unwanted side reactions.<br>
From some reduction products of aliphatic amine leaving group containing model compounds. NMR or thin layer chromatography showed in some cases after 1-3 months following nitre reduction or Aloe deprotection, that percentages of liberated leaving group remained unchanged. In each case, no more than one equivalent of aliphatic amine was released- Both the herein disclosed double and triple release aniline-based multiple release spacers are not able to release more than one leaving group, if the leaving group is an aliphatic amine. The multiple release structures as depicted in figures 7 and 8 have been shown in this invention to possess multiple release characteristics when the leaving group is an aromatic amine or an oxygen (hydroxyl). Apparently, the extent of electron-withdrawing capacity of the leaving groups determines whether more than one leaving group can be liberated from the herein disclosed spacers. When the multiple release spacer is a phenol- or thiophenol-based multiple release spacer or when the multiple"release spacer is coupled to single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers, aliphatic amines are also suitable leaving groups and release of all aliphatic amine leaving groups does occur. Aliphatic alcohols prove to be suitable leaving groups (e.g.. from ^N-CeH^CHNZ^C^-O-CO-Z'-O-paciitaxelh two molecuies of paclitaxel are released) and therefore release of phenol-based spacers, to which an aliphatic amine leaving group is connected, from a multiple release spacer (e.g., R:,K-C,H-CH=C(CH2-0-C(0)0-C6H4-CH20C(0)NRIR2)2) occurs by virtue of their increased leaving capability with respect to aliphatic alcohols. As elimination of alipha:ic amines from hydroxybenzyl-based spacer-aliphatic amine conjugates is known'0, release of aliphatic amines from spacer systems in which the aliphatic amine: is directly connected to a phenol-based spacer takes place as well.<br>
Upon removal or iransfoimazion of the specifier V in the compounds or prodrugs disclosed in this invention, tvds upon unmasking of B of the branched spacer or spacer system coupled TO V. under physiological conditions, the reactive intemiediate(s) formed after self-elimination is (are) likely to be trapped by water, thereby regenerating molecules like aminodiol 23 and/or aminotriol 16. When a multiple release conjugate or prodrug constructed with one of the monomers disclosed in this invention is used for drug delivery<br><br>
purposes, the degradation products of the prodrug or (bio)conjugate after the multiple self-elimination cascade must be non-toxic (except from drugs to be released in tumor targeting approaches). Therefore, we have tested die arninotriol monomer 16 and aminodiol monomer 23 for their cytotoxicity in a panel of seven well-characterized human tumor cell lines. Both compounds turned out to be non-toxic (see example 33).<br>
The total attainable number of end groups (e.g.. drug moieties) per dendrimeric prodrug or conjugate may be restricted by steric conditions. When incorporation of multiple large bioactive end groups is desired, it is likely that only several generations of multiple release monomelic spacers can be used. The number of end groups that can be incorporated may be increased by addition of additional unbranched self-elimination spacer(s) (systems) to a generation of multiple release spacers or to the highest generation of multiple release spacer(s) before leaving groups Z in order to enlarge the outer sphere surface, thereby enabling attachment of more end groups.<br>
The electronic cascade self-elimination process of 4-aminobenzyi alcohol 1,6-elimination spacers is known to proceed with a short half-live. This is an important factor in drug delivery applications of self-elimination spacers, as fast drug release after site-specific activation is required. When a slower release of leaving groups is desired. the spacer monomer may be tuned such that the spacer elimination process is retarded. This can be of use when the functional multiple release spacers or spacer systems of this invention are used for controlled release purposes.<br>
Unbranched and branched monomelic aminobenzyloxycarbonyl and related electronic cascade spacers or spacer systems can be coupled to a next generation of monomeric spacers via carbamate bonds, which are presumably more stable under physiological conditions than ester or carbonate bonds34.<br>
In the present invention, the synthesis and application of new multiple release spacers and spacer systems is described. In one embodiment, the dual or triple release monomer(s) employed in the multiple release prodrug or (bio)conjugate release the end groups (drugs) through several consecutive 1,4-, 1,6-, or 1,8-eliminations. Proof of principle of double or triple self-elimination was delivered upon chemical reduction of<br><br>
the nitrobenzyl or nitrocinnamyl derivatives containing benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, or paclitaxel as leaving groups (figures 19, 22, 23, 26). Complete release was observed by thin layer chromatography, and was unambiguously confirmed by NMR. Also the comprnnid containing 2 generations of double release monomers and 4 &gt;     paclitaxel moieties was shown to release all end groups following reduction of the nitro group (figure 23).<br>
Obviously, unbranched self-elimination spacers may be incorporated in between the specifier and the multiple release spacers. This may be beneficial for the enzymatic removal or transformation of the specifier. A branched multiple release moiety directly coupled to the specifier may increase steric crowding around the specifier-spacer bond to be cleaved; additional single release self-elimination spacers may provide a solution here.<br>
Thus, for efficient removal or transformation of the specifier, in some cases it is panicularly preferred to incorporate one or more single release self-elimination spacers in between specifier and one or more generation(s) of a multiple release spacer. This means that in compounds of formula<br>

\^^~.)v/X^xC(DiX(F((A-),Z)f)e)d)c, v - x &gt; 0.<br>
Ir_ addition, siagk release self-elimination spacers may be added to the highest generation of the multiple release spacer(s) before leaying groups Z. This may be beneficial for enhanced .release of Z, depending on the chemical nature of the function with which Z. preferably a drag, is attached to the spacer. Incorporation of single release self-eliminaiion spacers before Z (for example drug moieties) may be beneficial for the stability of the final product. If, for example, a self-elimination ©-amino aminocarbonyl cyciization spacer is incorporated in between the single release or multiple release electronic cascade spacer and a leaving group that is connected through its hydroxyl group, the stability of the final product may be increased when<br><br>
used under physiological conditions. Furthermore, when only aniline-based multiple release spacers are used, addition of single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers to a generation of multiple release spacers or, preferably, to the highest generation of multiple release spacer(s) before leaving groups Z enables the release of two or more leaving groups Z that are coupled with their aliphatic amino group to the multiple release spacer system.<br>
When only aniline-based multiple release spacers are used and no single release phenol- or thiophenol-based spacers are incorporated into the multiple release spacer system to which leaving groups Z are coupled with their aliphatic amino group only 1 Z group will be released.<br>
