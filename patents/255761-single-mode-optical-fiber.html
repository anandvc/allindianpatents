The present invention relates to a single-mode optical fiber (hereinafter, referred to as an SMF) that has chromatic dispersion characteristics equivalent to those of a conventional SMF and that has a very small bending loss when bent around a small radius.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-250039 filed on August 30, 2004 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-296369 filed on October 8, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, developments of a transmission system and an optical fiber that use Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) have been actively advanced with the objective of increasing the data transmission rate in backbone and/or long-distance systems.    The characteristics such as suppression of the nonlinear and control of the chromatic dispersion effect have been demanded for optical fibers for WDM transmission. In recent years, fibers in which the dispersion slope is decreased for a system called metro (metropolitan area network) with a span of about several kilometers or fibers that suffer virtually no loss increase due to OH are proposed.<br>
On the other hand, when introduction of fibers to offices and homes (Fiber To The Home; FTTH) is taken into consideration, characteristics different from those for the above-described optical fibers for transmission are required.    In the case of wiring the fibers in the building or the house, there is the possibility that a very small bending around a radius such as 15 mm or 10 mm occurs.    Furthermore, when the extra length of the fiber is stored, it is very important that loss increase does not occur even if the fiber is wound around a small radius.    That is, it is a very important characteristic for the optical fiber for FTTH to be insensitive to a small-radius bend.    The connectivity with optical<br><br>
fibers (many of which are SMFs for transmission at a normal wavelength, i.e., 1300 nm) used from the base station to the building or to the house is also an important point. From such viewpoints, many reports on and patent application of optical fibers with reduced bending loss have been made (for example, refer to Patent Documents 1 to 4 and Non-Patent Documents 1 to 5).<br>

(2004)<br>
In the current FTTH system, a Passive Optical Network (PON) that employs SMFs for transmission in the 1300-nm wavelength band is widely used.<br>
However, these conventional optical fibers have generally allowed bending radius of about 30 mm.    In the wiring of the fibers, close attention has been required to<br><br>
eliminate an extra bending.<br>
Recently, SMFs have been commercialized that permit allowable bending radiuses down to 15 mm by reducing the mode field diameter (hereinafter, referred to as MFD) while maintaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics that comply with ITU-T G.652 (hereinafter, referred to as G.652), the international standard for the SMF for the 1300-nm wavelength band.    However, such optical fibers had a problem in that bending loss suddenly increases with a bending radius of 15 mm or less.    FIG. 1 is a graph exemplifying a bending radius dependence of the bending loss of an optical fiber with an allowable bending radius of 15 mm.    As shown in FIG. 1, the optical fiber with the conventional allowable bending radius of 15 mm suffers a sudden increase in bending loss when the bending radius falls below 10 mm.<br>
For a wiring use in buildings and homes, there are cases where a bending radius of 15 mm or less is needed.    The optical fibers proposed in the above-mentioned Patent Documents 1 to 3 and Non-Patent Documents 1 to 5 are assumed to be used in an environment in which a bending around a 15-mm radius or less may be applied.    An optical fiber with enhanced bending characteristics generally has a longer zero-dispersion wavelength, and thus has a larger absolute value of the chromatic dispersion in the 1300-nm wavelength band compared with the normal SMF.    For example, Patent Document 1 shows an example in which the optical fiber with low bending loss disclosed therein is -4.6 to -10.7 ps/nm/km in the 1300-nm wavelength band.    The chromatic dispersion of this conventional optical fiber with low bending loss is large as the absolute value compared with the fact that the chromatic dispersion in the 1300-nm band under G.652 is in the range of 0 to -2.2 ps/nm/km when calculated by the definition of the zero-dispersion wavelength and the slope under G. 652.   However, the chromatic dispersion on this level has rarely posed a problem over a distance on the order of several tens of meters such as in indoor wiring.<br>
On the other hand, there is a need also for optical fibers for transmission lines to be resistant to bending loss when their handling in a cable or a closure box is taken into consideration.    However, there are cases where the chromatic dispersion value of the low<br><br>
bending loss optical fiber shown in Patent Document 1 poses a problem when the fiber is used in the PON system.    ITU-T G.983 or the like rules that, in the PON system used for the FTTH service, the 1500-nm wavelength band is used for the transmission from the base station to the user and that the 1300-nm wavelength band is used for the transmission from the user to the base station.    As for the light source for the 1300-nm wavelength band, an inexpensive Fabry-perot laser (hereinafter, referred to as FP laser) is widely used. Because the FP laser is based on multimode oscillation, the characteristics thereof are greatly affected by the chromatic dispersion value of the optical fiber that works as the transmission line.    Current transmission apparatuses are designed with the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G. 652 in mind.    Therefore, there are cases where a large-absolute-valued chromatic dispersion value that the conventional, low bending loss fibers have is not preferable because it may cause a communication failure.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The SMF of the present invention has the characteristics as follows: a cut-off<br><br>
1.5<r2></r2>
0.5
In the SMF with the trench portion, it is preferable that the radius r3 of the trench portion be in the range of 6 um to 20 um.<br>
In the SMF with the trench portion, it is preferable that a radius u of the outer cladding be in the range of 28 urn to 64 urn.<br>
The SMF of the present invention preferably includes: a central core that has a radius ri and a refractive index ni; an inner cladding that is provided around the outer circumference of the central core and has a radius r2 and a refractive index n2; and an outer cladding that is provided around the outer circumference of the inner cladding and has a radius n and a refractive index ru, the SMF having a W-shaped refractive index profile in which the refractive indexes of the individual portions satisfy ni &gt; 114 &gt; n2.<br>
In the SMF with the W-shaped refractive index profile, letting, a relative refractive index difference of the central core be Ai and a relative refractive index difference of the inner cladding be A2 with reference to the outer cladding, it is preferable that the following relations be satisfied:<br>
0.42%

-1.0% <a2></a2>
In the SMF with the W-shaped refractive index profile, letting y=(r2/rj)-|A2|, it is preferable that the following relations be satisfied:<br>
1.4-Ai - 0.8 <y></y>
y &gt; 0.075%.<br>
In the SMF with the W-shaped refractive index profile, it is preferable that the radius r2 of the inner cladding be in the range of 4.5 um to 16 um.<br>
In the SMF with the W-shaped refractive index profile, it is preferable that the radius r4 of the outer cladding be in the range of 28 urn to 64 um.<br>
The SMF of the present invention has the characteristics as follows: a cut-off wavelength is 1260 nm or less; a zero-dispersion wavelength is in the range of 1300 nm to<br><br>
wavelength is 1260 nm or less; a zero-dispersion wavelength is in the range of 1300 nm to 1324 nm; a zero-dispersion slope is 0.093 ps/nm2/km or less; an MFD at a wavelength of 1310 nm is in the range of 5.5 (im to 7.9 |im; and a bending loss that is produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns is 0.5 dB or less at a wavelength of 1550 nm.<br>
Furthermore, the cut-off wavelength of the low bending loss SMF of the present invention is defined by the cable cut-off wavelength, the fiber cut-off wavelength, or the jumper cut-off wavelength, according to the conditions of use of the fiber.    Measurement methods for each of the cut-off wavelengths are defined under ITU-T G. 650.1, "Definitions and test methods for linear, deterministic attributes of single-mode fibre and cable."<br>
In the low bending loss SMF of the present invention, it is preferable that the chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm be +18 ps/nm/km or less.    G.652 lists 17 ps/nm/km as the typical value for the chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm.    When the chromatic dispersion value shows an extremely larger value than this, it is not preferable from a viewpoint of transmission line design.<br>
Furthermore, in the low bending loss SMF of the present invention, it is preferable that a Relative Dispersion Slope (RDS) at a wavelength of 1550 nm be in the range of 0.003 nm" to 0.004 nm"1.    This RDS is a parameter acquired by (dispersion slope)/(chromatic dispersion value), and is an indicator for determining the matching between a dispersion compensating fiber and a dispersion compensated fiber.    The RDS of the optical fiber defined under the current G.652 (hereinafter, referred to as G.652 fiber) is about 0.0032 nm" .    When a high-speed, long-distance transmission is performed, a dispersion compensating fiber is indispensable.    If the optical fiber has the same RDS as the G.652 fiber, which is currently in wide use, it is possible to compensate the chromatic dispersion of the fiber using the dispersion compensating fiber for the G.652 fiber to be used as the G.652 fiber.    In the SMF of the present invention, a dispersion compensating fiber for the G.652 fiber can be utilized if the RDS thereof is in the range of 0.003 nm"1 to 0.004 nm"1.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that the low bending loss SMF include: a central core that has a radius ri and a refractive index ni; an inner cladding that is provided around the outer circumference of the central core and has a radius r2 and a refractive index n2; a trench portion that is provided around the outer circumference of the inner cladding and has a radius r3 and a refractive index ny, and an outer cladding that is provided around the outer circumference of the trench portion and has a radius fy and a refractive index 114, with a refractive index profile in which the refractive indexes of the individual portions satisfy n1 &gt; 04 &gt; n2 &gt; n3.    Note that the respective radiuses r2,r3, and r4 of the inner cladding, the trench portion, and the outer cladding are distances from the center of the central core to the outer periphery edge of the relevant portions.    FIG. 3 to FIG. 5 exemplify a refractive index profile of respective low bending loss SMFs 10, 20, and 30 with a trench portion.    In the figures, reference numeral 1 denotes a central core, reference numeral 2 an inner cladding, reference numeral 3 a trench portion, and reference numerals 4 and 5 outer claddings.<br>
Such refractive index profiles are disclosed in Patent Document 4.    The invention described in Patent Document 4 discloses the effect of this refractive index profile in the design of a so-called dispersion-shifted optical fiber that takes the zero-dispersion wavelength near 1550 nm.    However, it does not disclose the main object of the present invention, that is, the effect of this refractive index profile with the zero-dispersion wavelength near 1300 nm.<br>
In the low bending loss SMF 10, 20, and 30 with the trench portion, it is preferable that with reference to the refractive index 114, a relative refractive index difference Ai of the central core, a relative refractive index difference A2 of the inner cladding, and a relative refractive index difference A3 of the trench portion satisfy the relations as follows:<br>
0.40% 
-0.20% 
-1.0%<a3></a3><br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that a radius ri of the central core, a radius r2 of the inner cladding, and a radius r3 of the trench portion satisfy the relations as follows:<br><br>
When the relative refractive index difference Ai of the central core falls below 0.40%, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 nm exceeds 7.9 p,m.    In association with this, the bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns exceeds 0.1 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm.    Therefore, the characteristic of low bending loss, which is the object of the present invention, cannot be satisfied.    Furthermore, when the relative refractive index difference Aj of the central core is more than 0.85%, it becomes impossible to retain the zero-dispersion wavelength in the range of 1300 nm to 1324 nm.<br>
The relative refractive index difference A2 of the inner cladding needs to be in the range of-0.20% to 0.00% from the viewpoint of the zero-dispersion wavelength and the chromatic dispersion value at 1550 nm.    When A2 is less than -0.20%, r2/ri needs to be 3.0 or more to satisfy the desired zero-dispersion wavelength and 1550-nm chromatic dispersion.    This is not desirable from the viewpoint of fiber manufacturing. Furthermore, when A2 is more than 0.00%, the conditions of the zero-dispersion wavelength of 1300 nm to 1324 nm and the chromatic dispersion value of typical 17 ps/nm/km at a wavelength of 1550 nm cannot be satisfied.<br>
The relative refractive index difference A3 of the trench portion needs to be -1.0% or more and less than A3 from the viewpoint of reduction in bending loss.<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph showing the simulation results of A3 dependence of a bending loss in the SMF that has a refractive index profile of n/ri = 2.2, Ai = 0.50%, A2 = 0.0%, and A3 = -0.1 to -1.3%, with (r3 - r2)/ri being changed to 0.6, 0.8, and 1.5. Note that in the simulation, a cable cut-off wavelength is assumed as the cut-off wavelength, and the cable cut-off wavelength is 1220 nm in all the cases. As is seen from FIG. 2, the bending loss changes so as to take a local minimal value with respect to A3, although the tendency varies according to the difference in (r3 - r2)/ri.    Therefore, unless A3 has a relative<br><br>
refractive index smaller than Δ2, sufficient effect of bending loss reduction cannot be obtained.    Furthermore, when A3 is less than -0.1%, the effect is lost from the viewpoint of reduction in bending loss.    It is desirable that A3 be in the range of -0.2% to -0.6%.<br>
The ratio of r2/ri is selected from the range of 1.5 to 3.0 according to Δ1 and the like.    When Δ1 is small, a large r2/r1 is selected from the range; when Δ1 is large, a small r2/r1 is selected from the range.<br>
The ratio of (r3 - r2)/r1 can be flexibly set in combination with A3.    However, when (r3 - r2)/r1 falls below 0.5, sufficient effect cannot be obtained from the viewpoint of control over chromatic dispersion and of reduction in bending loss.    Furthermore, when (r3 - r2)/r1 exceeds 3.0, it may be difficult to make the single-mode transmission available.<br>
The radius r3 of the trench portion is selected from the range of 5.0 μm to 20 μm according to a combination of the above-described parameters.<br>
The radius r4 of the outer cladding can be set irrespective of the above-described parameters.    In many cases, the radius r4 of the outer cladding of a general optical fiber has 62.5 urn (diameter of 125 μm) as its center value.    However, the center value for the radius is appropriately set in the range of 30 μm to 62.5 μm according to the purpose of use.    For example, in an optical fiber for component use that is assumed to be stored by being wound around a small bending radius, the radius is often set to 40 μm.    Therefore, it is desirable that 14 be in the range of 28 μm to 64 μm, with the manufacture margin taken into consideration.<br>
Tables 1 to 3 show design examples, in various conditions, of the low bending loss SMF with a trench according to the present invention (refer to Example 1 to Example 22).    In these Example 1 to Example 22, the cable cut-off wavelength is 1220 nm.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Note tr inner cladding and the outer cladding are distanc the outer periphery edge of the relevant portions index profiles of the low bending loss SMFs 40, index profile of the present invention. In the fij central core, reference numeral 2 an inner claddi: claddings.<br>
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, in the low bending loss SMFs in Example 1 to e 18 according to the present invention, the chromatic dispersion value at a lgth of 1550 nm is +18ps/nm/krn or less, and the bending loss produced when the wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns is 0.1 dB or less at a wavelength of n.   Therefore, an SMF with very low bending loss can be actualized while tiing to the chromatic dispersion characteristics defined under G.652.<br>
The low bending loss SMF of the present invention can be manufactured with the aterial (for example, silica-based glass) as that for the conventional, known SMF the similar manufacturing method to that for the conventional, known SMF, with ;ption being that the refractive index profile and radius of each layer are iately set so as to satisfy the individual parameters described above.<br>
The low bending loss SMF of the present invention has a very low bending loss onforming to the chromatic dispersion characteristics defined under G.652. •re, it can be preferably utilized also for an SMF for indoor wiring in an FTTH and the like.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a low bending loss eludes: a central core that has a radius ri and a refractive index ni; an inner g that is provided around the outer circumference of the central core and has a 2 and a refractive index n2; and an outer cladding that is provided around the outer erence of the inner cladding and has a radius r4 and a refractive index 114, the SMF a W-shaped refractive index profile in which the refractive indexes of the aal portions satisfy ni &gt; ru &gt; n2.   Note that the respective radiuses r2 and u of the adding and the outer cladding are distances from the center of the central core to :r periphery edge of the relevant portions.    FIG. 6 to FIG. 8 exemplify refractive rofiles of the low bending loss SMFs 40, 50, and 60 with the W-shaped refractive rofile of the present invention.   In the figures, reference numeral 1 denotes a ;ore, reference numeral 2 an inner cladding, and reference numerals 4 and 5 outer is.<br><br>
In the low bending loss SMFs 40, 50, and 60 with the W-shaped refractive index profile, letting a relative refractive index difference of the central core be Aj and a relative refractive index difference of the inner cladding be A2 with reference to the outer cladding, it is preferable that the following relations be satisfied:<br>
0.42% 
1.5<r2></r2>
-1.0% <a2></a2>
Furthermore, letting y = (r2/ri)-|A2|, it is preferable that the following relations be satisfied:<br>
1.4-Aj - 0.8 <y></y>
y&gt; 0.075%.<br>
When the relative refractive index difference Ai of the central core falls below 0.42%, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 nm exceeds 7.9 um.   In association with this, the bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns exceeds 0.5 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm.   Therefore, the actualization of the characteristic of low bending loss, which is the object of the present invention, cannot be achieved.    On the other hand, when the relative refractive index difference Ai exceeds 0.85%, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 falls below 5.5 um.    This may lead to deteriorated connectivity, and thus is not preferable.    As for r2/ri and A2 that define the inner cladding, it is preferable that r2/ri be in the range of 1.5 to 5.0 and A2 be in the range of -1.0% to -0.05%.   For these parameters, appropriate values are selected according to the manufacturing methods.<br>
Furthermore, as for r2/ri, Ai, and A2, it is preferable that y defined by y = (r2/n)-|A2| be set so as to be in the range of (1.4-Ai - 0.8) to (1.4-Ai - 0.05).    Setting y in the above-mentioned range with respect to Ai enables the restriction of the zero-dispersion wavelength in the range of 13 00 nm to 1324 nm.   Note that the above-mentioned two conditions cannot be satisfied also when y is less than 0.075%.<br>
In the low bending loss SMFs 40, 50, and 60 with the W-shaped refractive index profile, it is preferable that the radius r2 of the inner cladding be in the range of 4.5 um to<br><br>
16 um.<br>
The radius u of the outer cladding can be set irrespective of the above-described parameters.    In many cases, the radius u of the outer cladding of a general optical fiber has 62.5 urn (diameter of 125 μm) as its center value.    However, the center value for the radius is appropriately set in the range of 30 μm to 62.5 μm according to the purpose of use.   For example, in an optical fiber for component use that is assumed to be stored by being wound around a small bending radius, the radius is often set to 40 μm.    Therefore, it is desirable that r4 be in the range of 28 μm to 64 μm, with the manufacture margin taken into consideration.<br>
Tables 4 to 6 show design examples, in various conditions, of the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention with a W-shaped refractive index profile (refer to Example 23 to Example 44).   In these Example 23 to Example 44, the cable cut-off wavelength is 1220 nm.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wavelength of 1550 nm is +18ps/nm/km or less, and the bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns is 0.5 dB or less at a wavelength of 1550 nm.    Therefore, an SMF with very low bending loss can be actualized while conforming to the chromatic dispersion characteristics defined under G.652.<br>
Examples (Example 1)<br>
In this example, the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention was manufactured based on Example 14 shown in Table 2.    Fig. 3 shows the refractive index profile of the low bending loss SMF 10 manufactured in this example.    This low bending loss SMF 10 was manufactured by first layering the central core 1 made of silica-based glass, the inner cladding 2, the trench portion 3, and a part of the outer cladding 4 by the MCVD method, then performing an outside vapor deposition to layer the remaining outer cladding 5, and finally drawing the obtained optical fiber preform in the same manner as in the normal SMF.    The characteristics of the obtained low bending loss SMF 10 were measured.   The results are shown in Table7.<br><br><br>
In the low bending loss SMF 10 of this example, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 was 7.40 urn, which is lower than the range of G.652.    However, the zero-dispersion wavelength was 1316.5 nm.    Therefore, this satisfied the definition under G.652.    The chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm was 16.5 ps/nm/km, which is a value in conformance with the typical value of G.652.    The bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns is very small, that is,<br><br>
0.03 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm.   Therefore, an SMF with a very small bending loss while retaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G.652 was obtained.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
In this example, the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention was manufactured based on Example 6 shown in Table 1.   Fig. 4 shows the refractive index profile of the low bending loss SMF 20 manufactured in this example.    This low bending loss SMF 20 was manufactured by first layering the central core 1 made of silica-based glass, the inner cladding 2, the trench portion 3, and a part of the outer cladding 4 by the MC VD method, then performing an outside vapor deposition to layer the remaining outer cladding 5, and finally drawing the obtained optical fiber preform in the same manner as in the normal SMF.   The characteristics of the obtained low bending loss SMF 20 were measured.   The results are shown in Table 8.<br><br><br>
In the low bending loss SMF 20 of this example, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 was 6.19 um, which is even lower than the MFD of Example 1.   However, the zero-dispersion wavelength was 136.2 nm.    Therefore, this satisfied the definition under G652.    The chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm was 16.6 ps/nm/km, which is a value in conformance with the typical value of G.652.<br>
As for the bending loss, very small values less than 0.1 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm were obtained when the fiber was wound around not only a 10-mm radius but<br><br>
also around a 7.5-mm radius and a 5.0-mm radius for 10 turns.    Furthermore, also at a wavelength of 1650 nm, virtually no bending loss was observed in a 10-mm radius and a 7.5-mm radius.    Thus, in this example, an SMF with a very small bending loss while retaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G.652 was obtained.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
In the example, the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention was manufactured based on Example 6 shown in Table 1.   Fig. 5 shows the refractive index profile of the low bending loss SMF 30 manufactured in this example.    This low bending loss SMF 30 was manufactured by first layering the central core 1 made of silica-based glass, the inner cladding 2, the trench portion 3, and a part of the outer cladding 4 by the MCVD method, then performing an outside vapor deposition to layer the remaining outer cladding 5, and finally drawing the obtained optical fiber preform in the same manner as in the normal SMF.    The characteristics of the obtained low bending loss SMF 30 were measured.   The results are shown in Table 9.<br><br><br>
In the low bending loss SMF 30 of this example, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 was 7.67 μm, which is larger than the SMF of Example 1.    The zero-dispersion wavelength was 1309.3 nm.   Therefore, this satisfied the definition under G.652.   The chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm was 17.3 ps/nm/km, which is a value in conformance with the typical value of G.652.    The bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns is very small, that is, 0.03 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm.    Therefore, an SMF with a very small bending loss while<br><br>
retaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G.652 was obtained.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
In this example, the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention was manufactured based on Example 24 shown in Table 4.   Fig. 6 shows the refractive index profile of the low bending loss SMF 40 manufactured in this example.    This low bending loss SMF 40 was manufactured by first layering the central core 1 made of silica-based glass, the inner cladding 2 by the VAD method, then layering the outer cladding 5 by the outside vapor deposition method, and finally drawing the obtained optical fiber preform in the same manner as in the normal SMF.   The characteristics of the obtained low bending loss SMF 40 were measured.   The results are shown in Table 10.<br><br><br>
In the low bending loss SMF 40 of this example, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 was 7.90 um, which is lower than the range of G.652.    However, the zero-dispersion wavelength was 1313.8 nm.   Therefore, this satisfied the definition under G.652.    The chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm was 16.4 ps/nm/km, which is a value in conformance with the typical value of G.652.    The bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 10-mm radius for 10 turns is very small, that is, 0.14 dB at a wavelength of 15 50 nm.    Therefore, an SMF with a very small bending loss<br><br>
while retaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G.652 was obtained.<br>
(Example 5)<br>
In this example, the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention was manufactured based on Example 28 shown in Table 4.    Fig. 7 shows the refractive index profile of the low bending loss SMF 50 manufactured in this example.    This low bending loss SMF 50 was manufactured by first layering the central core 1 made of silica-based glass, the inner cladding 2, and a part of the outer cladding 4 by the MCVD method, then performing an outside vapor deposition to layer the remaining outer cladding 5, and finally drawing the obtained optical fiber preform in the same manner as in the normal SMF. The characteristics of the obtained low bending loss SMF 50 were measured.    The results are shown in Table 11.<br><br><br>
In the low bending loss SMF 50 of this example, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 was 7.28 una, which is lower than the range of G.652, but the zero-dispersion wavelength was 1302.3 nm.   Therefore, this satisfied the definition under G.652.    The chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm was 16.6 ps/nm/km, which is a value in conformance with the typical value of G.652.   The bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 7.5-mm radius for 10 turns is very small, that is, 0.15 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm.    Therefore, an SMF with a very small bending loss while<br><br>
retaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G.652 was obtained.<br>
(Example 6)<br>
In this example, the low bending loss SMF according to the present invention was manufactured based on Example 35 shown in Table 5.   Fig. 8 shows the refractive index profile of the low bending loss SMF 60 manufactured in this example.   This low bending loss SMF 60 was manufactured by first layering the central core 1 made of silica-based glass, the inner cladding 2, and a part of the outer cladding 4 by the MCVD method, then performing an outside vapor deposition to layer the remaining outer cladding 5, and finally drawing the obtained optical fiber preform in the same manner as in the normal SMF. The characteristics of the obtained low bending loss SMF 60 were measured.    The results are shown in Table 12.<br>
I<br><br><br>
In the low bending loss SMF 60 of this example, the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 was 6.27 um, which is lower than the range of G.652.    However, the zero-dispersion wavelength was 1310.8 nm.   Therefore, this satisfied the definition under G.652.    The chromatic dispersion value at a wavelength of 1550 nm was 15.6 ps/nm/km, which is a value in conformance with the typical value of G.652.    The bending loss produced when the fiber is wound around a 5-mm radius for 10 turns is very small, that is, 0.09 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm.    Therefore, an SMF with a very small bending loss<br><br>
while retaining the chromatic dispersion characteristics of G.652 was obtained.<br>
