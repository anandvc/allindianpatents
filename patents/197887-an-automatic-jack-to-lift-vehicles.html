TITLE: "AN AUTOMATIC JACK TO LIFT VEfflCLES'<br>
Name of the applicant: BEDMUTHA SAGAR NEMICHAND.<br>
Address: C/o. Shri R.K. Kunkulol<br>
306, Gagan Enclave, Near Marketyard, Bibwewadi-Lullnagar Road, PUNE- 411 037, Maharashtra, INDIA.<br>
Nationality: INDIAN.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
PRIOR ART WITH DRAWBACKS<br>
A vehicle has to be lifted for some repair work or to change the punctured tyre. Conventional jacks used for lifting small four-wheeler or three-wheeler are mainly, toggle jacks, screw jacks or hydraulic jacks. In spite of having their own advantages, these jacks have drawbacks. They are less efficient and hence large efforts are required to operate them. In addition, the time required to lift and again lower the vehicle is more.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
A major object of the invention is to provide a device, which would lift, and then lower small cars or light vehicles very quickly to save time.<br>
Another object of the invention is to lift and lower the light vehicle in lesser time and with lesser efforts by the operator.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The automatic jack is an invention to lift vehicles, particularly small four-wheeler or three-wheeler vehicles. The main object of this invention is to provide an apparatus that can lift vehicles quickly. Further object of the jack is to lift the vehicle with very less physical efforts. In conjunction with this, this device consists of a hehcal compression spring, which rests on a rectangular base plate. The potential energy stored in this helical compression spring when it is in the compressed condition, is used to lift the load of the vehicle. A standing lever is manually operated to compress and decompress the heUcal compression spring. A rectangular link accommodates one end of this standing lever and directs a pushrod. Two inclined slots are provided in the rectangular link to direct one end of the pushrod. The other end of the pushrod is guided by pushrod guides, which move inside cylinder which is threaded partially at outside. To keep the helical compression spring in compressed condition, a locking hook is provided to the rectangular link and a hinged hook is incorporated to the rectangular base plate. The hinged hook is moved by a set of tension springs, one of which is fixed to the rectangular base plate. The compact size of the rectangular base plate creates ovenurning of the jack while operating. To avoid this, a set of foldable pull links is provided beside the rectangular base plate. These pull links when extended outside prevent overturning of the jack.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view (isometric view) of the present invention.<br>
'jFlG. 2 is a sectional front view showing the cylinder which is threaded partially at ourside,<br>
with pushrod and pushrod guides.<br>
For purpose of describing the'invention, terminology used in reference to the numbered components in the drawings is as follows:<br>
Rectangular base plate	<br>
Helical compression spring	<br><br><br>
DETALED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION IN CONTEXT OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention consists of a rectangular base plate (1), on which a helical compression spring<br>
(2)	is fitted using a lower circular plate (5). The lower circular plate (5) is permanently fixed<br>
to the rectangular base plate (1).<br>
To guide the helical compression spring (2), a cylinder which is threaded partially at outside<br>
(3)	is incorporated into the rectangular base plate (1). The cyhnder which is threaded partially<br>
at outside (3) directs a pushrod (4), which has one end of spherical shape. It is guided by<br>
pushrod guides (18 A, 18B). The pushrod (4) is mounted in the inclined slots (7 A, 7B) of the<br>
rectangular link (7) using an upper circular plate (6) and two 'U' pins (lOA, IDE). One end of<br>
the rectangular link (7) is hinged in between two vertical links (8) by means of a pin (9) and a<br>
'U' pin (lOA), and to other end of the rectangular link, there is a standing lever<br>
accommodator (7C), which is used to accommodate the standing lever (19). A locking hook<br>
(11) of the rectangular link (7), which is locked by a hinged hook (12), by means of two<br>
tension springs (13A, 13B), one of which (13B) is attached in tie hooks (14A. 14B) for<br>
compressing and decompressing the helical compression spring (2) and the other tension<br>
spring (13A) is fitted permanently to the rectangular base plate (1). Two hinged pull links<br>
(15A, 15B) are used along with pull link guides (17A, 17B)^and stoppers (21 A, 2IB). The<br>
pull links (15A,15B) slide through the pull link guides (17A, 17B). Pull links (15A, 15B),<br>
when moved to their extreme outward position, prevent overturning of the jack in operation.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
First, the jack is placed in the clearance below the lateral side of the vehicle and the ground surface on which the vehicle and the jack are resting. When the vehicle would be lifted, it<br><br>
I would rest on the two rubber pads (20A, 20B) on the upper circular plate. Then both pull links (15A, 15B) are pulled to the possible extreme positions and tension spring (13B) is attached in the tie hook (14A) and the standing lever (19) is placed into the standing lever accommodator (7C). Load is applied manually on the free end of the standing lever (19). Due to the force and the lever action, the helical compression spring (2) would be compressed and the hinged hook (12) would detach from the locking hook (11). Load can be removed from the standing lever (19), so that helical compression spring (2) is elongated in decompression and consequently the vehicle is lifted.<br>
To lower the vehicle, the tension spring (13B) is then attached in the tie hook (14B) and again load is applied on the free end of the standing lever (19). This would result in compression of the helical compression spring (2) and lower the vehicle. While coming down, the standing lever (19) would unhook the tension spring (13B) from the tie hook (14B). The length of hinged hook (12), tie hook (14B) and position of tension springs (13 A, 13B) is such adjusted that, the hinged hook (12) would get attached in hook (11) and the helical compression spring (2) is compressed again.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above mentioned invention provide following advantages:<br>
1.	It requires very less time to lift the vehicle and then lower it.<br>
2.	It requires very less physical efforts to operate.<br>
3.	It is easy to operate.<br>
4.	It is easy to manufacture and with reasonable cost of manufacturing.<br><br>
1 claim,<br>
1. An automatic jack, for lifting small four-wheeler or three-wheeler or light vehicles comprising,<br>
(a) a helical compression spring, to store energy, which rests on a lower circular plate of the rectangular base plate and moves the pushrod; (b) a lower circular plate fixed to the rectangular base plate, on which the above mentioned heUcal compression spring rests; (c) a cylinder which is threaded partially at outside, is fitted on the rectangular base plate and outside of which the helical compression spring is incorporated; (d) a rectangular link having two inclined slots to direct the pushrod; (e) a pushrod, one end of which moves in the inclined slots of a rectangular link and its other end is guided by the cylinder which is threaded partially at outside, and to which the upper circular plate with rubber pads is fixed; (f) a set of vertical links fixed to the rectangular base plate and which hinge one end of the rectangular link, along with a pin; (g) a hinged hook, hinged to the rectangular base plate and moved by two tension springs; (h) two tie hooks, fixed to the rectangular base plate and out of those two tie hooks one tie hook is used to tie the tension spring while compressing the helical compression spring and the other tie hook is used while decompressing the helical compression spring; (i) tw'o pull links, hinged using the pull link hinge, are incorporated beside the rectangular base plate, and the pull links slide on pull link guide and consist of stoppers at the end.<br>
2.
