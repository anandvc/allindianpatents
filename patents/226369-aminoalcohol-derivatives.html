Female Beagle dogs weighing 8.0-15,0 kg were fasted for 24 hours and maintained under halothane anesthesia.  A 12F Foley catheter was lubricated with water soluble jelly, inserted into the urethral orifice and advanced approximately 10 cm until the balloon tip was placed well inside the bladder.  The balloon was then inflated with 5 ml of room air and catheter slowly withdrawn just part the first resistance that is felt at the bladder neck.  Urine was completely drained out through the catheter, and 30 ml of biological saline was infused.  The catheter was connected to pressure transducer, and intravesical pressure (IVP) was continuously recorded.  The test compound was administered intravenously at 30 minutes before the<br><br>
administration of carbachol (1.8 |ig/kg) .  Percent inhibition of IVP increase by test compound was calculated by dividing IVPa (IVP increase induced by carbachol after test compound administration) by IVPb (IVP increase induced by carbachol just before test compound administration).<br>

To the mixture of 4'-[2-[[(2R)-2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]ethyl]-1,1'-biphenyl-4-nitrile (100 mg) in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) (10 ml) were added sodium azide (30 mg) and ammonium chloride (30 mg), and stirred at<br><br>
120'C  for 12 hours.  The resulting mixture was poured into a mixture of ethyl acetate and water, and the organic layer was washed with brine.  After the solvent was evaporated under pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give the corresponding tetrazole.  The obtained tetrazole was diluted with 6N hydrogen chloride in 1,4-dioxane (10 ml) and the mixture was allowed to keep at the room temperature for 4 hours.  The mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure and the obtained solid was washed with ether to give (lR)-2-[[(lR)-l-methyl-2-[4'-(lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl]ethyl]amino]-1-phenylethanol hydrochloride (25 mg) .<br>

4-[[4-(2-Aminoethyl)phenyl]thio]phenol (295 mg) and (2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)oxirane (186 mg) in ethanol (3.5 ml) was refluxed for 6 hours. The mixture was evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (chloroform/methanol = 100/3) to give 4-[[4-[2-[[(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]thio]phenol (155 mg).<br>
( + )ESI-MS m/z: 400 (M+H)+<br>
Example 73<br>
To a solution of tert-butyl N-[(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-N-[2-[4-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)thio]phenyl]-ethyl]carbamate (195 mg) and potassium carbonate (59 mg) in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 ml) was added tert-butyl bromoacetate (84 mg), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours.  The mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water.  The organic layer was separated, washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate = 3/1) to give tert-butyl [4-[[4-[2-[N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-N-[(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]thio]phenoxy]acetate (168 mg) .<br><br>
