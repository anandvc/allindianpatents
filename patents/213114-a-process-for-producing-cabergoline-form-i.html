The present invention concerns a new process for preparing crystalline Form I of cabergoline,<br>
Cabergoline is an ergoline derivative interacting with D2 dopamine receptors and is endowed with different useful pharmaceutical activities amd it is used in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, central nervous system disorders {CNSJ and other related diseases.<br>
Cabergoline is the generic name of l((6-"allylergolin'-8beta-yl) -carbonyl) -1- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) -3-ethylurea# described and claitt^d in US 4^526,892. The synthesis of cabergoline molecule is reported also in Eur. J* Med. Chem,, 24,421,(1989) and in GB-2,103,603-B. Crystalline cabergoline Form l^ an anhydrous not solvated form of cabergoline, was prepared by crystallization from diethyl ether, as described in II Famaco, 50 (3), 17S-178 (199S) .<br>
Cabergoline Form I^ like cabergoline, displays a significant inhibitory effect with regard prolactine and has therapeutic properties that make it possible to treat patients who have pathological conditions associated with an abnormal prolactin level, thus is useful in human and/or veterinary medicine. Cabergoline is also active^ aloi^ or in combination; in the treatment of reversible obstructive airways diseases, for controlling intraocular pressure and for the treament of glaucoma* It is also employed in the veterinary field, as antiprolactin agent and in cutting down drastically the proliferation of vertebrate animals. The several uses of cabergoline are for exaitple described in W09948484, WO9936095, US5705510, WO9505176, EP040,325. Cabergoline Form I is particularly useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), treatment of diseases like Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Multysystemic atrophy (MSA).<br>
During our developsnent work we discovered a new process for preparing crystalline Form I.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention concerns a new process for<br>
preparing Form 1 of cabergoline and a new solvate Form V of<br>
cabergoline useful as intermediate.<br>

Form I can be readily prepared according to the present<br>
invention starting from crude material by crystallization<br>
from a toluene/diethyl ether mixture, through a new solvate<br>
form V of cabergoline• The present process for preparing<br>
Form I shows advantages with respect to the old one because<br>
of its greater reproducibility.<br>
Characterisation<br>
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), differential scanning<br>
calorimetry (DSC), infrared (IR) spectroscopy and solid<br>
state ^^C-NMR were used to characterise the new form.<br>
X-Ray Fowder Diffraction<br>
Powder X-ray diffraction was performed using either a<br>
Scintag XI or X2 Advanced Diffraction System operating under<br>
Scintag DMS/NT® Ver i.30a and I*36b respectively, and<br>
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0^ software* The system used a<br>
copper X-ray source maintained at 45 kV and 40 mA to<br>
provide CuKa^ emission of 1.5406 Angstroms and a solid<br>
state peltler cooled detector. Beam aperture was controlled using tizbe divergence and anti-scatter slits of 2 and 4 mm and detector anti-scatter and receiving slits of 0.5 and 0.3 mm width. Data were collected from 2
 <br>
counting time. The samples were hand ground using a pestle<br>
and mortar and packed into an aluminum sample tray with a<br>
i2Tnm (diam*) x O.Snrni cavity*<br>
DSC<br>
Measurements of differential scanning calorimetry were<br>
obtained on a Mettler TA 4000 thermal analysis system.<br>
Approximately 8.5 mg samples were accurately weighed into a<br>
DSC pan. The pans were herrr^tically sealed and a pinhole was<br>
punched into the pan lid. The use of the pinhole allows for<br>
pressure release, but still assures that the thermal<br>
reactions proceed under controlled conditions. The samples<br>
were introduced into the DSC oven and then heated at a rate<br>
of 5**C/min, up to a final te!ii&gt;erature of 135^C.<br>
IR Spectroscopy<br>
IR spectra of cabergoline form I and V were obtained on a<br>
Perkin Elmer PT»IR spectrogOiotometer PARAGON 1000. The<br>
sample were prepared toy KBr powder technique registering the<br>
spectra on reflectance.<br>
Solid state "C-NMR<br>
Solid state ^C-NMR spectra were obtained on a MSL 300 Bruker<br>
instrument equipped with solid state facilities and variable<br>
temperature magic angle spinning probe. Cross polarisation<br>
experiments were performed by a decoupling field of 50 KHz<br>
and single pulse magic angle spinning experin^nts with<br>
recycle times ranging from lo to lOO records.<br>
The x-ray powder diffraction pattern for Form I (Figure l)<br>
shows a crystalline structure with useful distinctive<br>
peaks at aj^roximately 9,7, 10.4 and 24*8 deg 2-theta.<br>
The DSC curve of Form I (Figure 2) exhibits a melting<br>
endotherm at approximately 100**- 105**C, The integrated<br>
melting endotherm has a heat of fusion of approximately 60<br>
J/g.<br>
The IR spectrum of Form I is shown in Figure 3,<br>
The solid state "C-NMR spectrum of form I is shown in figure<br>
4.<br>
These data indicate that cabergoline Form 1 is a crystalline polymorph easily distinguishable by XRD and solid state ^^C-<br><br>
NMR techniques- DSC and IR are other two useful techniques<br>
to characterize the polymorph. The process of the present<br>
invention for producing crystalline cabergoline Form I is<br>
characteri2ed by crystallisation from a toluene/diethyl<br>
ether mixture. The process comprises dissolving the raw<br>
final cabergoline, obtained as an oil through the synthesis<br>
described in Eur. J. Med, C3iem.,24, 421^ U989) , in a<br>
suitable amount of a toluene/diethyl ether mixture,<br>
preferably about i:l mixture. The resultant solution is then<br>
cooled at a teitqperature of from -25** to -9
about "12**C for 17 hours. In these conditions, a toluene<br>
solvate is obtained, nanied Form V, that may be recovered by<br>
common procedures, for example by filtration under reduced<br>
pressure or by centrifugal filtration, followed by smoothly<br>
drying of the resultant solid. The resultant crystals of<br>
Form V are then converted into form X upon further drying.<br>
The crystals of Form I of cabegoline prepared according to<br>
the process of the present invention have preferably a<br>
polymorph purity &gt; 95%, more preferably &gt;98%. Toluene<br>
solvate form V is also object of the present invention. The<br>
x-ray powder diffraction pattern for Form V fFigure 5) shows<br>
a crystalline structure.<br>
llie DSC curve of solvate Form V (Figure 6) exhibits a<br>
melting endothenn at approximately 60 <br>
The IR spectrum of solvate Form V is shown in Figure 7.<br>
The solid state "c-NMR spectrum of form V is shown in figure<br>
8.<br>
•mese data indicate that cabergoline solvate Form V is<br>
easily distinguishable by XRD, DSC and solid state  <br>
techniques. IR| ccmibined with another analytical technique,<br>
is another method to identify the solvate.<br>
The solvate V of this invention is a true solvate having a<br>
fixed composition of about 0.5 toluene moles per mole of<br>
cabergoline.<br>
Example 1.<br>
The oil obtained by purification on a chromatographic column<br>
after the final step of the synthetic path according to the<br><br>
preparation described in Eur. J. Med. Chein,,24, 421, (1989) and containing 100 g of pure cabergoline was dissolved in toluene to give 243 g of a cabergoline toluene solution. The solution was introduced into a reactor pre-cooled at -12°C, and 182 g of toluene were added to give a 23.5% w/w cabergoline concentration in this solvent. After cooling again at -12«*C| 362 ml of diethyl ether were added. The inixture was cooled again at -12^0 and stirred at this temperature for about 17 hours. The obtained precipitate was filtered under vacuum and smoothly dried. The resultant crystal solvate form V was identified by XRDe DSC, IR and NMR, data shown in figures 5*8 respectively. Yield was about 45% (w/w) on the basis of pure cabergoline initial content. Example 2.<br>
The crystal solvate form V obtained in exatrple 1 was dried at a tenperature of from 4D*'C under vacuum to 65**C under vacuiim* After drying, the resultant crystal form I was identified by XKD, DSC, IR and NMR, data shown in figures 1-4 respectively. Yield was about 40% on the basis of pure cabergoline initial content. The assayed polymorph purity was &gt;98%.<br>
