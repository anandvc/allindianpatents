				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and a device for executing a thermodynamic<br>
cycle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Thermal power stations use thermodynamic cycle processes for converting heat<br>
into mechanical or electrical energy. Conventional thermal power stations create<br>
the heat by burning fuel, in particular the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas. The cycle<br>
processes are operated in this case for example on the basis of the classic<br>
Rankine cycle with water as its working substance. Its high boiling point however<br>
makes water unattractive, especially when using heat sources with temperatures<br>
between 100 °C and 200 °C, e.g. geothermal liquids or waste heat from<br>
combustion processes, because the process is not cost effective.<br>
For heat sources with such a low temperature a wide diversity of technologies<br>
have been developed over recent years which make it possible to convert their<br>
heat into mechanical or electrical energy with a high degree of efficiency. As well<br>
as the Rankine process with organic working substances (Organic Rankine Cycle,<br>
ORC) a process stands out by virture of its markedly better levels of efficiency<br>
compared to the classic Rankine process. Various cycles for different applications<br>
have been developed on the basis of the Kalina cycle. Instead of water these<br>
cycles use a mixture of two substances (e.g. ammonia and water) as their<br>
working substance, with the non-isothermic boiling and condensation process of<br>
the mixture being utilized to increase the efficiency of the cycle by comparison<br>
with the Rankine cycle.<br>
For temperatures of the heat source of at least 140°C the<br>
Kalina cycle system KCS 11 (Kalina Cycle system 11) is<br>
preferably used. In this case a liquid working substance is<br>
pumped into a heat exchanger, referred to below as a<br>
preheating "heat exchanger" where it is heated up to boiling<br>
point by partial condensation of an expanded working substance<br>
flow. The pressurized boiling working substance flow is then<br>
divided up by a separator into a first and second partially<br>
flow. The first partial flow is partially evaporated in a<br>
first, further heat exchanger using heat generated by cooling<br>
down of a heat source (e.g. a geothermal liquid). The second<br>
partial flow is partially evaporated in a second, further heat<br>
exchanger using heat generated by partial condensation of the<br>
expanded working substance flow.<br>
The partially evaporated first and second partial flows are<br>
subsequently combined by a mixer and a partially evaporated<br>
working substance flow is formed. Subsequently in a third,<br>
further heat exchanger a gaseous working substance flow is<br>
created by transmission of heat from the heat source to the<br>
partially evaporated working substance flow.<br>
The gaseous working substance flow is subsequently expanded in<br>
a turbine and its energy is used for power generation. The<br>
expanded working substance flow is "hen partially condensed in<br>
the already mentioned second, further heat exchanger and in<br>
the preheating heat exchanger and finally created in a<br>
condenser by complete condensation of the iiquid working<br>
substance mentioned at the start and the cycle thereby closed.<br>
The object of the present invention is to create a method and<br>
a device for executing a thermodynamic cycle process which, by<br>
comparison with the prior art mentioned, makes possible a<br>
higher yield of mechanical and/or electrical energy without a<br>
significant increase in the costs of the plant.<br>
The object to which the method is directed is successfully achieved in<br>
accordance with the features of the invention, including the advantageous<br>
embodiments of the method. The object to which the device is directed is<br>
successfully achieved in accordance with the device features of the invention,<br>
including the advantageous embodiments of the device.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The invention uses as its starting point the idea that the heat of the heat source<br>
can be utilized all the better, the lower the temperature of the working substance<br>
before the partial evaporation of the first partial flow. If the first partial flow<br>
essentially features the same (low) temperature as the liquid working substance<br>
flow, more heat can be extracted from the heat source and used for generation<br>
of mechanical and/or electrical energy then when the liquid working substance<br>
flow has already been preheated. "Essentially the same temperature" is taken<br>
within the context of the invention to mean that the temperature difference<br>
amounts to only a few degrees Kelvin, e.g. because of slight cooling down of the<br>
pressurized liquid working substance before formation of a first partial flow or<br>
because of the pumping of the liquid working substance at an increased<br>
pressure.<br>
A comparatively better utilization of the heat source than in the prior art is thus<br>
possible, in which the first partial flow; because of the preheating of the<br>
pressurized liquid working substance flow up to boiling temperature by means of<br>
the preheating heat exchanger has a higher temperature than the liquid working<br>
substance flow.<br>
The invention makes it possible, by appropriate dimensioning<br>
of the cycle, especially the heating surfaces of the heat<br>
exchanger, especially to increase the important mass flow of<br>
the working substance for the generation of the mechanical or<br>
electrical energy at pressure, temperature and enthalpy of the<br>
gaseous working substance flow as well as of the liquid<br>
working substance flow which otherwise remains essentially the<br>
same compared with the prior art.<br>
The energy yield from better utilization of the heat of the<br>
heat source is in this case greater than the losses resulting<br>
from the non-utilization of the energy of the expanded working<br>
substance flow for preheating the pressurized liquid working<br>
substance flow with the aid of a preheating heat exchanger.<br>
Although an increased need for heating surfaces results in a<br>
demand for greater investment, these increased costs can<br>
largely be compensated for by the omission of the preheating<br>
heat exchanger and the resulting simplified pipework, so that<br>
the plant costs remain essentially the same.<br>
The first and the second heat exchanger are in this case<br>
advantageously dimensioned so that the first and the second<br>
partially evaporated partial flow have approximately the same<br>
temperature and the same steam content.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a multi-<br>
substance mixture is used as the working substance. The multi-<br>
substance mixture is preferably a two-substance mixture<br>
especially an ammonia-water mixture. As a result of the non--<br>
isothermic vaporization and condensation of such a mixture an<br>
especially high level of efficiency of the cycle can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Energy can be obtained in an especially environmentally-<br>
friendly way by using a geothermal liquid, especially thermal<br>
water from a geothermal source, as the heat source. Waste gases (exhaust<br>
gases) from gas and/or steam turbine plants can also be used as a heat source<br>
or heat generated in industrial production processes (e.g. in steel production)<br>
can be used.<br>
A high level of efficiency of this cycle can in this case be achieved by the heat<br>
source having a temperature of 100 °C to 200 °C, especially 140 °C to 200 °C.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention as well as a further advantageous embodiments of the invention<br>
are explained in more detail below with reference to exemplary embodiments in<br>
the accompanying figures. The Figures show :<br>
FIG 1 a circuit of an inventive device for executing a thermodynamic cycle<br>
process in a simplified schematic presentation.<br>
FIG 2 a cycle calculation for a device in accordance with FIG 1.<br>
FIG 3 a circuit for a device known from the prior art for executing a<br>
thermodynamic cycle process in a simplified, schematic diagram.<br>
FIG 4 a cycle calculation for a device in accordance with FIG 3.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The device 1 shown in FIG 1 for executing a thermodynamic cycle process<br>
features a (recuperative) heat exchanger HE5, which on the primary side has hot<br>
thermal water 20 from a geothermal source not shown in any greater detail<br>
flowing through it and is connected on the secondary side on the one hand to a<br>
mixer 5 and on the other hand to a turbine 2. The turbine 2 is connected on its<br>
output side to the secondary side of a heat exchanger HE2 which is connected in<br>
its turn to...................................................................................................................<br>
the primary side of a condenser HE1. The condenser HE1 is<br>
connected at its primary side output, if nee. via a condensate<br>
tank, via a pump 3 to a separator 4. The separator 4 is<br>
connected on the hand via the primary side of the heat<br>
exchanger HE2 and on the other via the secondary side of the<br>
heat exchanger HE4 to the mixer 5. The primary sides of heat<br>
exchangers HE5 and HE4 are connected to each other for letting<br>
through hot thermal water 20, with the thermal water first<br>
flowing through the heat exchanger HE3 and then through the<br>
heat exchanger HE4.<br>
A two-substance mixture of water and ammonia which thus<br>
exhibits a non-isothermal evaporation and condensation is used<br>
a working substance in the device 1. The working substance is<br>
present after the condenser HE1 in a liquid state as liquid<br>
working substance flow 13. With the aid of the pump 3 the<br>
liquid working substance flow 13 is pumped at an increased<br>
pressure and a pressurized liquid working substance flow 14<br>
created, which is divided up by the separator 4 into a first<br>
partial flow 16 and a second partial flow 17.<br>
The first partial flow 16 essentially has the same temperature<br>
as the liquid working substance flow 13. The first partial<br>
flow 16 is accepted on the secondary side by the heat<br>
exchanger HE4 and using heat already created by the cooling<br>
down of the thermal water flow 20 in the heat exchanger HE5,<br>
is partially evaporated and creates a partially evaporated<br>
first partial flow 16a. The second partial flow 17 is accepted<br>
on the primary side by the heat exchanger HE2 and using heat<br>
generated by partial condensation of a expanded working<br>
substance flow 11 accepted on the secondary side, is partially<br>
evaporated and creates a partially evaporated second partial<br>
flow 17a. The partially evaporated first and second partial<br>
flows 16a, 17a are subsequently combined in the mixer 5 into<br>
one partially evaporated working substance flow 18. The heat<br>
exchangers HE2 and HE4 are in this case dimensioned so that<br>
the first and the second partially evaporated partial flow 16a<br>
or 17a have approximately the same temperature and the same<br>
steam content.<br>
The partially evaporated working substance flow 18 is<br>
subsequently accepted on the secondary side of the heat<br>
exchanger HE5 and through cooling down of the hot thermal<br>
water flow 20 accepted on the primary side a completely<br>
evaporated, if necessary partially overheated gaseous working<br>
substance flow 10 is created. The gaseous working substance<br>
flow 10 will subsequently be expanded in the turbine 2, its<br>
energy converted into a usable form, e.g. into current via a<br>
generator not shown, and the expanded working substance flow<br>
11 created. The expanded working suostance flow 11 is<br>
partially condensed in the heat exchanger HE2 and a partially<br>
condensed, expanded working substance flow 12 created. The<br>
partially condensed expanded working substance flow 12 is<br>
subsequently condensed in the heat exchanger (condenser) HE1<br>
with the aid of an inflowing cooling water flow 25 and the<br>
liquid working substance flow 13 created. The heat transmitted<br>
by the condensation of the expanded working substance flow 12<br>
to the cooling water flow 25 is discharged by the outflowing<br>
cooling water flow 26.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a cycle calculation for a device for execution of<br>
the thermodynamic cycle process, which essentially corresponds<br>
to the device shown in FIG. land has additionally only been<br>
supplemented by a small number of valves and separator<br>
circuits 27. The following have been chosen as ini.tial<br>
conditions for the calculations:<br>
Temperature Mass flow<br>
Thermal water flow 20 190°C 71 kg/s<br>
Cooling water flow 25 10°C appr. 400 kg/s<br>
The ammonia concentration in the water amounts to 81%.<br>
Table 1 shows for a number of selected flows of the cycle tr.o<br>
result of the cycle calculation, with the power of the heat<br>
exchangers being selected in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The temperature of the first partial, flow 16 before entry into<br>
the heat exchanger HE4 amounts to 13.1°C and is thus at about<br>
the same temperature as the pressurized liquid working<br>
substance flow 14 or the liquid working substance flow 13<br>
(12.3°C). The electrical power whicn can be generated under<br>
these conditions with the aid of the turbine 2 amounts to<br>
6925 kW.<br>
FIG. 3 by contrast shows the circuit of a device 30 known in<br>
the prior art as KCS 11 (Kalina Cycle System 11) for executing<br>
a thermodynamic cycle. For better comparison of the known<br>
device 30 with the inventive device shown in FIG. 1 the<br>
corresponding elements or working substance flows are provided<br>
with the same reference symbols. Device 30 differs from the<br>
inventive device shown in FIG. 1 through a additional<br>
(recuperative) preheating neat exchanger HE3 connected on the<br>
primary side between the pump 3 and the separator 4 and on the<br>
secondary side between the heat exchanger HE2 and the<br>
condenser HE1 With the aid of the heat exchanger HE3 the<br>
pressurized, liquid working substance flow 14 is heated by<br>
further partial condensation of the already partially<br>
condensed, expanded working substance flow 12 up to its<br>
boiling point. The first partial flow 16 thus has the<br>
saturated water temperature and is fed at this temperature to<br>
the heat exchanger HE4. Because of this considerably increased<br>
temperature compared to the liquid working substance flow 13<br>
the heat of the thermal water flow 20 can be utilized less in<br>
the heat exchangers HE4 and HE5.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a cycle calculation for a device known from the<br>
prior art which essentially corresponds to the device 30 shown<br>
in FIG. 3 and has additionally only been supplemented by a<br>
number of valves 19 and a separator circuit 27. The same<br>
initial conditions for the calculations are used as those<br>
which were used for the cycle calculation in accordance with<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
Table 3 shows for a number of selected flows of the cycle the<br>
result of the cycle calculation, with the power of the heat<br>
exchangers being selected in accordance with Table 4.<br>
The electrical power able to be generated in this case amounts<br>
to only 6638 kW. The obtainable electrical power is thus<br>
higher in the case of the inventive cycle according to FIG 1<br>
and 2 by 4,3% than in the case of the cycle known from the<br>
prior art. This additional yield comes from the higher heat<br>
extracted from the thermal water (the temperature of the<br>
outflowing thermal water 22 amounts to only 50.59°C in the<br>
case of the cycle shown in FIG 2 compared to 70.06°C in the<br>
case of the cycle shown in FIG. 4) and the higher mass flow of<br>
the working substance obtainable before entry into the turbine<br>
2 (30.2 kg/s in the case of the cycle shown in FIG. 2 and 29<br>
kg/s in the case of the cycle shown in FIG. 4) .<br>
The increased heating surface requirement of 6.25% also<br>
resulting from the increased heat exchanger power results in a<br>
greater need for investment. These increased costs can however<br>
be balanced out in large part by the simplified pipework on<br>
the evaporation side of the turbine 2 and by the omission of<br>
heat exchanger HE2, so that the plant costs overall remain<br>
essentially the same.<br>
The invention has been described above with reference to<br>
preferred exemplary embodiments, but can generally be seen as<br>
not being restricted to these exemplary embodiments. Instead<br>
there is the option of a plurality of variations and<br>
modifications of the invention or of these exemplary<br>
embodiments. For example the number of heat exchangers can be<br>
increased , additional valves and separators can be connected<br>
into the circuit - as also occurs in the circuit example<br>
depicted in FIG. 2. Furthermore the gaseous working substance<br>
flow 10 can be expanded in more than one step, e.g. via two<br>
turbines switched in series.<br>
