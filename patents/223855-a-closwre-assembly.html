				<td>A CLOSURE ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to multi-fold window and/or door assemblies.<br>
In particular, the present invention is directed to a multi-fold arrangement adapted to lend<br>
itself to a more expansive opening configuration compared to alternative arrangements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Typical bifold assemblies as disclosed in New Zealand Patent Specification no. 336696, are<br>
capable of being folded or opened to the edge of the window or door opening. In such instances the<br>
folded windows or door panels create an obstruction of sorts, be it visual or otherwise. Such prior art<br>
arrangements do not allow the entire wall opening to be fully utilised as they are constrained by<br>
hinges built into tracking arrangements. It would be an advantage for multi-fold panel assemblies to<br>
have the prospect of clearing the opening of the panels when in the opened condition. New Zealand<br>
Patent Specification no. 505958 sought to achieve this outcome by releasing the distal pivot axis<br>
from the tracks or track in the plane of the opening. The procedure of New Zealand Patent<br>
Specification no. 505958 is effective for the purpose but does require sturdy mounts as, in the open<br>
folded condition against the building structure away from the opening, loadings of the panel pairs is<br>
carried through the sole remaining pivot axis.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to more fully exploit the space provided for by a wall<br>
opening for which a multifold window and/or door assembly is intended.<br>
The present invention is therefore directed to an arrangement, for at least a bifold panel<br>
(glazed or otherwise) structure, and whether for door or window purposes or a hybrid of both,<br>
whether top or bottom mounted (supported), which alone or in conjunction with a mirrored<br>
arrangement can provide an alternative to existing multi-fold panel systems. As used therein and<br>
herein the term "plane of the opening" preferably includes a straight plane but may include a curved<br>
or other<br>
shaped opening and consequently the "plane of the opening" should be interpreted as including any<br>
form of opening capable of being tracked substantially to the shape of the opening.<br>
Where reference herein is made to the "mutual disalignment" of panels it is meant a<br>
positioning of the panels in a non co-planar condition. Such mutual disalignment is preferably in the<br>
form of a concertina like condition where the at least two panels are in a substantially overlying<br>
position.<br>
The present invention is directed to assemblies, methods and procedures that are capable of<br>
achieving a similar outcome as that of New Zealand patent specification no. 505958 as far as<br>
allowing the panels to be cleared from the opening of the structure when open or to at least provide<br>
the public with a useful choice.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for a closure assembly of an opening of or in a<br>
building or like structure, said closure assembly having at least two mutually pivoted panels mounted<br>

alignment provide at least a partial closure of said opening parallel to the plane of the opening, and<br>
(ii) an opened condition whereby said at least two panels, mutually disaligned by having<br>
pivoted mutually towards each other, are substantially clear of the plane of the opening and where at<br>
least one of said two panels, lies parallel with respect to the plane of the opening,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
When using a door consisting of multiple panels to close or partially close a<br>
door way consideration needs to be given to the not in consequential weight of such<br>
assemblies. The panels comprising the door are often glazed and thus in conjunction<br>
with the panel frame can weigh a significant amount. This weight poses more<br>
problems as the door is folded out of cover of the opening. Support of one or more<br>
of the panels by suspending from above or supporting from below can alleviate this<br>
problem. Such support can also guide the door in its opening and closing.<br>
However to make the most of the space available the door needs also to fold flat and<br>
to present minimal protrusion from the building, also preferably parallel with the<br>
building envelope, when opened.<br>
The present invention utilises a modified guide track for example at the top<br>
(or at the bottom) of the door frame, and extensile member linked bottom (or top)<br>
tracked guide can allow the door to be sufficiently supported and guided as well as<br>
folding clear out of the way of the opening.<br>
As shown in Figure 1A, a multi-fold panel assembly 40 consists of a first<br>
panel 41, a second panel 42 and optionally a third panel 43. The third panel 43 is<br>
located from the distal end of the second panel 42 away from the first panel via a<br>
hinge 44B. The preferred arrangement of Figure 1A would be referred to as a three<br>
panel configuration. Other configurations such as a 2 panel configuration where<br>
panels 41 and 42 alone are provided are considered also. Other configures can be<br>
envisaged such as a mirror image of panels 41 and 42 to the right of panel 43<br>
opening away and to the right on a similar skewed track (a so called three - two<br>
configuration). Other configurations such as a two - two configuration (panels 41<br>
and 42 fold away to the left hand side and mirror images of 41 and 42 folding away<br>
to the right hand side), and other such configurations of three, two and one panels<br>
are possible also. The first panel 41 may be hung off the surrounding frame 45 via<br>
a hinge 46, where subsequent panels are hung off the first and second panel via<br>
hinges 44A and 44B. Openings could also be spanned with multiple sets of multifold<br>
panel assemblies, e.g. one assembly from the left hand side and one from the<br>
right. Each hinge alternates on its' side of the door so that the assembly of the<br>
multi-fold panel may be folded in the concertina like manner. Depicted in the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention the centre section of each panel (41,<br>
42 or 43) is glazed 49, though any means for filling the opening may be used such<br>
as opaque or translucent materials, or solid materials to form barriers or at least to<br>
partially close the opening.<br>
Due to the weight of the panels that hangs on the hinge 46 a top runner 50 is<br>
engaged on a top skewed rail 51 via four bearinged rollers 53 which travel inside<br>
the top skewed rail 51 as shown in Figure 2. The top runner 50 is a supporting<br>
runner which is of a bogie like construction. The top runner provides vertical<br>
support to the panels from the point of engagement of the bogie with the panels<br>
independent from the top skewed rail 51. The skewed rail 51 is preferably of<br>
constant cross section. The rollers 53 and the vertical pivot 192 thereof are<br>
preferably positioned about the mid thickness "X" of the panels.<br>
The top rail 51 (preferably an extrusion) need not be angled over the entire<br>
travel distance to the opening, but rather may be parallel to the plane of opening and<br>
closing (55 and 54 respectively) for the majority of its length and then move from<br>
the open plane 55 to the closed plane 54 at the very last length of door travel. Such<br>
track need not be straight or simply angled but may curve at a point along its length<br>
to allow folding of the door panels into opened plane 55 when opened. For example<br>
the track may be "s" shaped at its end of travel toward the fixed hinged end 68.<br>
The assembly in vertical cross-section is shown in Figures 2 and 3, the<br>
exterior of the doorway being on the left hand side of the page. On Figure 1B the<br>
interior of the opening is on the upper portion and the exterior of the opening is on<br>
the lower portion.<br>
Assembled about the moving multi-fold panel assembly is a frame consisting<br>
of lower extrusion 59 and upper assembly 66 associated with each other via side<br>
frame members 70 and 71. The lower portion of the frame is defined by a lower<br>
extrusion 59 which in this embodiment has a track 52 associated within it.<br>
However it may be a separate track is attached to the lower extrusion 59 whilst the<br>
lower extrusion is preferred for the purposes of tracked support of the door panels, it<br>
is not essential.<br>
Accordingly the closure assembly of the present invention is a fully framed<br>
item and can be handled as a unit for insertion into an opening of a building. The<br>
entire assembly can be positioned into the opening without the need for any<br>
additional at least structural components and/or hanging of doors subsequent to the<br>
engagement at the opening of the structure.<br>
The upper assembly 66 consists of a foundation frame member 80, a pelmet<br>
extrusion 81 adjustably attached to the base extrusion via threaded fasteners 82 and<br>
a top skewed rail 51, with which the top runner 50 is engaged. The pelmet<br>
extrusion 81 preferably carries and preferably in a fixed and secured condition, the<br>
top rail 51. The foundation extrusion 80 is attached by penetrative fastenings 67 to<br>
the framing timbers 83 (shown in phantom). The top skewed rail 51 is located on<br>
an angle within the pelmet frame 81 and has soffit members 84 and 85, roughly<br>
triangular shaped, to close off the void 86 of the pelmet extrusion, for aesthetic<br>
purposes.<br>
An opening, such as that to be selectively closed by the present invention<br>
will normally have timber framing (such as 83) or the like defining the opening.<br>
The framing of the opening provides a mount for the multi fold panel assembly to<br>
be fastened to. In the preferred embodiment penetrative fastenings 67 (e.g. screws<br>
or nails) are used that pass through part of the surround comprised of upper<br>
assembly 66, vertical extrusions 70 and 71, and lower extrusion 59) of the multi<br>
fold panel into the framing members, e.g. framing timbers 83 in this case.<br>
At the hinged end 68 and the free end 69 of the multi-fold panel assembly,<br>
are vertical extrusions 70 and 71. The four extrusions (70, 71, 59 and 80) are<br>
preferably pre-assembled together to provide a surrounding frame 45 in which the<br>
multi-fold panel assembly is positioned and moves.<br>
Fascia 72 (or reveals or liners, such as those made of wood) attach to the<br>
periphery of the frame to provide in part a means to secure the frame to the<br>
building, and also provide an aesthetically appealing interior finish. Rebates 193 in<br>
such fascia 72 may be provided to receive an edge of interior wallboard lining.<br>
It is desirable for such multi-fold panel assemblies when open (such as<br>
shown at the right hand side of Figure 1) to lie each in its own plane which is a<br>
plane parallel to that which they are in when closed (e.g. the plane of the opening).<br>
Further more this position should be out of the way of the opening of the frame<br>
which they are to close. Such a concertina position allows full access in and out of<br>
the doorway, has no protruding panels or similar in which to catch or be walked<br>
into, and also provides an aesthetically pleasing look to the door when opened.<br>
When moving through from the closed position to the opening position (to<br>
lie folded against the exterior of the building) the panel to which the top runner 50<br>
is attached, the second panel 42 in Figure 1, must track from the plane 54 in which<br>
the door lies when closed rail extrusion to the plane 55 in which the panel 42<br>
substantially lies when open. To achieve this the top skewed rail extrusion 51 in<br>
which the top runner 50 is engaged must be on a skewed angle from the closed<br>
plane to the open plane, 54 and 55 respectively. Such an angle (87 in Figure 1) will<br>
vary depending upon the width of the aperture to be opened (i.e. the width of panels<br>
41 and 42) and thickness of the panels used which defines the out of plane 54<br>
movement of the top runner by distance x to plane 55. The not inconsequential<br>
weight of part of the panels is supported and also guided throughout its movement<br>
by the track 51. The critical point of its movement when most weight is applied as<br>
tension or the track 51 is when the panel 42 is at 90 degrees to the plane of the<br>
opening 54.<br>
The skewed track need not be straight. It may only skew at a region towards<br>
or at the edge of the opening of the multi-fold panel (i.e. toward end 68), sufficient<br>
to allow the bogie on top runner 50 for panel 42 to move out of the closed plane 54<br>
to the open plane 55 so skewing of the support track need not be across the full<br>
extent of the scope of the closed condition of the two panels but can be a partial<br>
skewing over only part of the opening in that respect see for example Figure 17.<br>
The closed position of the panel 42 in cross section is shown in Figure 2.<br>
The closed door second panel 42 lies in the closed plane 54. The closed and opened<br>
cross-sectional locations of the top skewed rail 51 are shown in Figures 2 and 3<br>
respectively.<br>
Upon opening, panels 41 and 42 break outwards (downwards in Figure 1B)<br>
at hinge point 44A. The panel 42 tracks along the top rail 51 from closed to open<br>
positions and vice versa. In moving from the closed plane 54 to the open plane 55,<br>
the panel 42 comes to lie in or nearly parallel to the opened plane position 55, and<br>
hence is rotated about hinge 46 through 180 degrees.<br>
For aesthetic purposes it is preferable not to have a skewed track in the<br>
bottom extrusion 59 (although this can be done as an alternative or in addition) that<br>
forms the lower part of the overall frame in which the multi-fold panel opens and<br>
closes.<br>
A lower track 52 of a different kind is however preferably provided for<br>
security reasons and also to guide the panels about pivot 44B. The track prevents in<br>
part, in the closed position, the door from being pulled off its hinges from below<br>
(for example by external force or wind pressure). It also holds the distal end of the<br>
distal panel 42 in it plane 55 when in the open condition. Through the opening<br>
sequence the lower track provides a guide means and imparts rigidity to the opening<br>
of the door in conjunction with the lower runner 88.<br>
The lower runner 88 has the function once the door multi-fold panels have<br>
been opened to hold the resulting folded assembly together and prevent at least the<br>
panel 42 from swinging outwardly at its bottom edge.<br>
As the alternative to having a skewed track for the registering of the bottom<br>
of the panels with the frame, and in order to utilise a straight track 52 (i.e. parallel to<br>
the opened or closed planes) on the lower frame 59, an extensile association is<br>
provided by articulation member 61 which allows the pivotal engagement of a<br>
lower runner 62 (with rollers 89) to travel in a straight line (parallel to the open and<br>
closed planes) with the panel 42 as it moves out from plane 54 to its open condition.<br>
Figure 10 shows the movement of the lower runner 62 through the closed, midway<br>
and fully open positions 62A, 62B and 62C respectively in relation to the<br>
articulation arm 61 which moves from a position 61A substantially parallel to the<br>
closed plane 54 through an arc of approximately 90 degrees (through 61B) to lie at<br>
the position 61C. In the fully opened condition the arm preferably extends at 90<br>
degrees to the plane 54 as any movement to the panel with which the runner<br>
assembly 88 is engaged e.g. as a result of wind loading, will be significantly in a<br>
direction at 90 degrees to such a plane. Accordingly if the arm 61 extends parallel<br>
to such a direction, it is able to provide maximum rigidity to ensure holding of the<br>
panel. The more preferred form of runner assembly 88 as per Figure 6 may not<br>
have the arm 61 move through 90 degrees. This therefore allows the lower runner<br>
88 to travel on a lower straight line parallel to the open and closed planes whilst<br>
allowing the point axially aligned with the top runner 50 to travel through the<br>
skewed path whilst still being connected to the lower runner 88.<br>
The lower runner 88 consists of an articulation hinge 63 which allows the<br>
panel to which it is attached to rotate freely in relation to the arm 61 which is guided<br>
by the lower track 52. Pivotally attached to the swing arm 61 is an arm 64 on which<br>
are rollers 89 of a bogie like assembly is provided. Preferably there are two rollers<br>
parallel aligned to travel on the lower track 52. Between the articulation hinge 63<br>
and the arm 64 and its pivot 90 is interposed the swing arm 61.<br>
The top runner 50 consists of four bearinged rollers 110 which sit on a<br>
bearing carriage 73, the bearing carriage being pivoted at a point 74 for a 3 panel<br>
door (as shown) which is hinged via the body 75 which is internally attached to the<br>
distant end of the distal panel (panel 42 in Figure 1). The bearing carriage 73 can<br>
alternatively pivot at point 111 for a 2 or 4 panel unit. The pivot happens at pivot<br>
point 111 for 2 and 4 panel units so the gear does not (a), for a 2 panel bump into<br>
the jamb extrusion 71 when closed and (b) in a four panel, bump into each other<br>
where they meet at the middle of the door.<br>
An alternative method of retaining at least panels 41 and 42 together (at the<br>
edges away from their respective hinged edges) for such similar purposes is shown<br>
in Figure 8 whereby mutually attractive means (for example magnets but not limited<br>
thereto) are located on the inner faces 91 and 92 of the panels 41 and 42. The<br>
mutually attractive means 93 and 94 are at least located at facing positions of panels<br>
41 and 42 when in the open condition at or towards the bottom of the panels.<br>
Preferably such mutually attracted means are also provided on facing surfaces of<br>
panel 43 and 42 when in the open condition to allow for panel 43 to be retained<br>
securely in the open condition against panel 42 yet still be conveniently releasable<br>
therefrom when it is desired to move the assembly to a closed condition. Such<br>
mutually attractive means may be provided either towards the top bottom or other<br>
location at the distal most end of the panel 43 facing panel 42. However a<br>
mechanical fastening means may also be provided for this purpose.<br>
As part of the installation of the multi-fold panel assembly of the present<br>
invention in the configuration where the panels are supported from above (as shown<br>
in the drawings) the foundation frame member 80 of the upper assembly 66 is<br>
mounted to the surrounding frame work of wood (or other materials) 83 by<br>
penetrative fasteners 67. These hold the foundations frame member 80 fast and<br>
rigid to the surrounding frame work. The sub frame 81 such as a pelmet is fastened<br>
to the foundation frame member 80 by means of threaded fasteners engagement<br>
screws 82. These are preferably spaced either side of the closure plane 54 at regular<br>
intervals spaced along the length of the span of the pelmet 80. For example in<br>
Figure 1 these fasteners would run either side of the line 54 between at least the<br>
hinge point 44B to the hinge point 46. Apertures 97 in the soffit 84 and 85, allow<br>
for a tool to be passed through the soffit to engage the fasteners 82 and turn them<br>
accordingly. Alternatively the soffit may be easily removable for access to be<br>
gained. The engagement of the head of the fastener with the pelmet 81 or resulting<br>
assembly 98 allows the pelmet 81 to be adjusted both up and down in the horizontal<br>
direction but also rotationally about an axis horizontal and parallel to the plane 54 to<br>
affect a rotational of movement of the pelmet frame in the resulting sub assembly<br>
relative to the foundation frame member 80. Such adjustment allows the top<br>
skewed rail extrusion 51 to be adjusted in relation to the top runner 50 to ensure that<br>
any sag of the upper assembly 26 is taken up so that the top runner or runners 50<br>
does not jam within the rail and is allowed to run smoothly. Any such adjustment<br>
would be done after installation of the frame and multi-fold assembly once weight<br>
is exerted on the pelmet. Obviously as the pelmet 81 is moved the track 51 which is<br>
in integral (although preferably of a separate extrusion) with the pelmet 81 is moved<br>
accordingly.<br>
Towards the end of movement of the closed condition of the multi-fold panel<br>
assembly the panel 42 and particularly the interior edge 99 of the distal vertical<br>
edge of panel 42 (at top and/or bottom) is brought close to and in many<br>
circumstances will hit the exterior facing rear edge 100 of the bottom frame<br>
extrusion where a seal 101 is provided. Repeated impact of this type can damage<br>
both the panel and the frame extrusion and also the seal 101 (preferably of a mohair<br>
type seal) in that vicinity. It is to be noted that such impact only occurs in the last<br>
portion of closing travel of such panels as 42. Therefore a bump extrusion 102 is<br>
provided, located in such a manner relative to the seal 101 so that the edge 99 will<br>
strike the extrusion 102 and not impact upon the frame 100 or towards the base of<br>
the seal 101. Such a bump extrusion may be replaceable and/or at least sacrificial<br>
for this purpose. Materials for such extrusions may be of a plastics material or other<br>
such replaceable materials but which will not damage the coating of panel 42.<br>
A retention pin 103 is located on the lower frame at the position where the<br>
panel 42 is located in the closed condition to engage the lower portions of the<br>
leading edge of the panel 42 such that when the panel is in an enclosed position the<br>
panel (or panels attached to) cannot swing out from the bottom frame. Such<br>
movement may occur under wind loading or by force applied to the bottom edge of<br>
the panel in the closed position. Thus when the panel is closed and locked it cannot<br>
be forced open at either the top or the bottom of the frame. The retention pin 103 is<br>
mounted on mounting plates 104 and 105 respectively which are fastened to the<br>
lower extrusion 59. A like pin may also be used to capture the panel 41 against<br>
frame at closed condition.<br>
Where panels are bottom guided and supported or both bottom and top<br>
supported the pelmet arrangement can be reversed to be (or also be) provided at<br>
 bottom. However adjustment need not be necessary at bottom since no cantilevered<br>
support need be provided.<br>
The lower runner 88 arrangement can in reversed circumstances, be<br>
positioned at the top.<br>

34. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 33, wherein a locking pin is provided<br>
fixed to said structure, said locking pin positioned to engage at distal region of said distal panel<br>
against an outwardly facing surface of said distal panel when said panels are at and proximate to its<br>
closed condition to capture from moving outwardly.<br>
35. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 22 to 34, wherein a locking pin is<br>
provided fixed to said frame, said locking pin positioned to engage at distal region of said distal<br>
panel against an outwardly facing surface of said distal panel when said panels are at and proximate<br>
to its closed condition to capture said distal region against a jam portion of said frame to thereby<br>
prevent said distal region from moving outwardly.<br>
36. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 22 to 34, wherein said distal panel is<br>
supported at one of the top and bottom thereof by a said support runner and wherein at the other of<br>
said top or bottom the distal region of said distal panel has an outwardly facing surface and wherein a<br>
locking pin is provided fixed to said frame structure, said locking pin positioned to engage the<br>
outwardly facing surface of said distal panel when said panels are at and proximate to its closed<br>
condition to capture said distal region against a jam portion of said frame to thereby prevent said<br>
distal region from moving outwardly.<br>
37. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 35 or 36, wherein said outwardly facing<br>
surface is a concealed to the outside surface of said distal panel.<br>
38. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 37, wherein provided to the proximal<br>
periphery disposed region of said proximal panel on the to be distal panel facing side thereof when in<br>
the opened condition, is a first mutually attractive means, the dital panel being provided at a<br>
corresponding location to the location of said first mutually attractive means on a proximal panel<br>
facing side thereof when in the opened condition, with a second mutually attractive means to thereby<br>
allow the interaction of said mutually attractive means when said panels are in the opened condition<br>
to encourage said distal region of said distal panel to remain engaged to the proximal periphery<br>
disposed region of said proximal panel.<br>
39. A closure assembly as claimed in claim 38, wherein said first and second mutually attractive<br>
means are magnetically attractive means.<br>
40. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 38 or 39, wherein said first and second<br>
mutually attractive means are both magnets.<br>
41. A closure assembly as claimed in any one of claims 38 to 40, wherein said first and second<br>
mutually attractive means are positioned towardsthe bottom of said panels.<br>
A closure assembly (40) of an opening in a building having at least two mutually pivoted<br>
panels (41, 42, 43) mounted with the mutual pivot axis (44) at least substantially vertical. The panels<br>
are movable between a closed condition whereby the at least substantially in mutual alignment<br>
provide at least a partial closure of the opening in or substantially parallel to the plane of the opening,<br>
and an opened condition whereby the at least two panels, mutually disaligned by having pivoted<br>
mutually towards each other, are substantially clear of the plane of the opening. A proximate panel<br>
(41) is pivoted by a vertical pivot axis substantially in the plane of the opening at adjacent a vertical<br>
periphery of the opening (45). The distal region of distal pane (42) is supported by at least one<br>
supporting runner. The supporting runner is guided by a support track (51) which is skewed with<br>
respect to the plane of the opening and has the affect of spacing the supporting runner out of the<br>
plane of the opening at the vertical periphery.</td>
