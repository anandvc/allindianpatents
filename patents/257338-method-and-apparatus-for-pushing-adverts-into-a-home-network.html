				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the communication networks. The invention relates to the home networks describes the method of content distribution into these networks over the Internet. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for pushing adverts into a home network.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Content distribution is not really new, but doing it over the Internet especially achieving a business model around it for an entirely new industry which is very much possible, that could be based on this invention.<br>
There are a few technologies to "pull" content already popular, and the model of their working is very different. And they serve a different purpose, wherein information flow is pulled by an agent to the requested client from a "web-server" and this is specific to web applications only - RSS technology for instance. The one mentioned here is not for this purpose. Moreover the pull mechanism is useful for information sharing, especially news, image sharing, etc. And this is useful for a well defined server always placed on the Internet. But in the case of a device which wants to advertise at a given instant into the homes connected across, it does not serve the purpose.<br>
The US patent titled, "Target information generation and ad server", provides a method and a system for selecting and delivering advertisements in an Internet network based on user profile information. The system comprises a first server node that acts as a user access point to the network, a storage repository for serving and storing user profile data, a second server node for generating user-preference data, an advertisement server for servicing advertisement data, and a software application for performing advertisement selection. The user accesses the first server node to receive the advertisement data, the advertisement data being   selected   by   matching   the   user-preference   data   with   the   stored<br><br>
advertisements. However, there is no explicit mention of matching of certified content.<br>
In another US patent titled "Information and advertising distribution system and method" the patent publication describes an information and advertisement distribution system. The system comprises a data server and a plurality of workstations located remotely from the data server. The information items and advertisements are categorized and stored in the data server. Each workstation comprises a display device, and a local memory for storing information items and advertisements. Some of the workstations comprise a profiler for storing subscriber profile data. The information items and advertisements are filtered based on the subscriber profile data and then displayed on the display device of the workstation. The patent publication provides a system and a method to display an advertisement on the workstation of a subscriber based on the subscriber preferences and profile data and also the concept of categorization of information and advertisements. However, the patent publication does not mention the concept of pushing the advertisements on to the workstation of the subscriber.<br>
In yet another US patent titled," User centered push methods and system", the patent describes a dynamic model for locating and pushing information to a client to be displayed on a user monitor. The information may be from sources internal or external to the user environment. The patent publication provides a method of pushing information to the user based on the specific interests of the user. However, the patent publication does not mention the concepts of certification and categorization of information.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a home networking environment, the central device called a Residential Gateway acts as the bridge between the external world of Internet, and the devices on a Home Network. Assuming that there is an array of such devices in<br><br>
the world, and each of them connected to a storage server internally (we called this as the Advert Server, as its storing adverts for us). The way of distributing the content to these devices can be very different, a bit similar to the current broadcast model. But there are lots of differences that need to be taken care rather, which are mainly the salient points of this invention. Now this idea was only for someone trying to merely push adverts, thus making it an uni-directional approach of advertising. The proposed model brings in a new form of (adverts) content to be "pushed" into the user's homes directly.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for pushing adverts into a home network comprising the steps of:<br>
■	Push the content into a home network along with specific content tags, over<br>
the Internet (or equivalent means) - done by a Content Service Provider;<br>
■	Check if the Content Service Provider's authorization is valid - by the<br>
Residential Gateway;<br>
■	If his authorization succeeds, compare Content Service Provider's tags to<br>
find a match with user's own preferences (previously set by the user) on<br>
the Residential Gateway;<br>
■	Rejecting the Content Service Provider's content if authorization doesn't<br>
succeed, or if the user-preferences do not match thereon;<br>
■	If the Residential Gateway finds that the user-preferences match while<br>
comparing the Content Service Provider's tags, it shall forward this content<br>
on to a pre-assigned Advert Server within the home network<br>
A Content Service Provider obtains information about the various users and their preferences of content. This user-specific information could be available from various sources (external), or could also be based on his viewing patterns of his<br><br>
content and deduce such information. Based on which he pushes adverts specific to the user. These user-preferences are categorized into various areas of interest, and tagged appropriately.<br>
The authorization of Content Service Provider is done by a third-party certifying agency. The Content Service Provider provides his specific advertising content across into home networks. This content type is contained in a member database and tagged into different pre-defined categories. Each user shall define his/her preferences on the Residential Gateway and these preferences are represented using tags, which acts as filter for data that's trying to enter the home. The content service provider multicasts content to the list of members, with the required authorizing certificates. The user/subscriber validates the authorizations and checks for the preference tags and if the tags match, then the content is allowed to enter into the home network, where it gets stored on the appropriate server defined for storing.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a system for pushing adverts into a home network comprising:<br>
■	Means for pushing the content into the home network using specific tags<br>
categorizing the user-preferences over the Internet by a Content Service<br>
Provider;<br>
■	Means for checking the authorizations of the Content Service Provider<br>
providing the Push Adverts service by a third-party agency;<br>
■	Means for checking if the Content Service Provider's authorization is valid<br>
by a Residential Gateway (perhaps a re-check done here, but required as<br>
its a sensitive issues concerning the consumer);<br>
■	Means for comparing Content Service Provider's tags to find a match with<br>
the user-preferences by the Residential Gateway if authorization is valid;<br><br>
■	Means for rejecting the Content Service Provider's content if authorization<br>
is not valid;<br>
■	Means for directing the content on to a pre-assigned Advert Server by the<br>
Residential Gateway if it finds the user-preferences are matching while<br>
comparing the Content Service Provider's tags ; and<br>
■	Means for rejecting the Content Service Provider's content if Residential<br>
Gateway finds that the user-preferences are not matching while comparing<br>
the Content Service Provider's tags.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the device accessing a home network from a remote location. Figure 2 depicts the flowchart describing the method adopted in the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details<br><br>
are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in<br>
detail.<br>
There are various kinds of content that could be found useful for distribution<br>
across to various homes. A simple standard around could simplify this job. In the<br>
future when we have home networks prevalent in the homes, it would certainly call<br>
for a distribution model for content into these home networks, and especially with<br>
content that the end-user desires to have.<br>
For example we could have the following content being distributed across - an amateur advert producer would like to show his productions to get attention of the various users across; a video on demand service provider would like to advertise the latest movies into the various homes across; And this shall also be distributed to the right persons, straight into their homes. This provides an extensive advertising network that is different from the current scenario, and certainly helps the content service provider the right audience he needs to reach, and who are interested in his content specifically, thus making sure that he gets the much needed eyeballs as well.<br>
The process could include a third-party certifying agency for enabling these content providers with the necessary authorizations, thus avoiding spammers getting into homes. This agency shall make sure of the type of content these content providers would produce, and tag them into different categories predefined. These categories could include various types - sports-F1, sports-football, movies-comedy, movies-action, news-latest, news-stock, and many more.<br>
Figure 1 shows the device accessing a home network from a remote location. The content providers obtain the required target audience database, which they would like to target their adverts specifically. This could be obtained from various sources, and could include various agencies specializing in them, or it could be the list of subscribers attached to a specific content service provider based on the subscriptions they have, etc.<br><br>
Each user shall define his/her preferences on the Residential Gateway. These preferences are similar to the tags mentioned above, and act as filter for data that's trying to enter the home. The content service provider multicasts his content to the list of members, with the required authorizing certificates. The user/subscriber validates these authorizations, checks for the preference tags. If these tags match, then the content is allowed to enter into the home network, and it gets stored on the appropriate server defined for storing such content.<br>
The various steps occurring in the proposed invention can be depicted as follows as shown in Figure 2, provide that:<br>
1)	Authorization of CSP done by a certified agency for advertising, for<br>
"specific content tags only" which helps to control the flow of authorized<br>
content into the homes.<br>
2)	CSP has the content for advertising across into home networks.<br>
3)	The member database comprises the CSPs content type.<br>
Step i) CSP push content (along with its respective tags) into the home network and required authorizations over the Internet.<br>
Step ii) RG checks if the CSP's authorization is a valid one, else reject the CSP.<br>
Step iii) If it is valid, RG compares CSP's tags to check if its matching with his own user-preferences, else reject the CSP's content.<br>
Step iv) While comparing the CSP's tags, if it finds that it is matching, RG directs the content on to a pre-assigned Advert Server, else rejects the CSP's content.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of<br><br>
the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi-function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended :laims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
