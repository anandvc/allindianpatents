				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention  relates to  an.electronic<br>
instrument for process control in steel plants.<br>
The invention relates more  particularly to an instrument which is suitable for detecting the  presence  of light-emitting heated objects and also light-reflecting non-heated objects and also any object through method of light interruption in different locations in steel  plants such as rail end structural mills,   plate mills, blooming mills,  billet mills,  skelp mills, wire rod mills,  merchant mills,   continuous casting mills in steel  plants;   also for detecting the  presence of furnace flame  and  controlling the limit  switches of  cranes/ other machines  used in steel  plants.<br>
The devices  used  at present for detecting the  presence of light emitting/reflecting objects  in steel  plants have  the drawbacks in that these  are   (i) very expensive,   (ii) not readily repairable,   (iii) not  adequately sensitive,   (iv) liable to be out of order through inadvertent operational errors         (v) slow  to respond,    (vi) needs  7/8-core  cable between  the sensor and monitor unit,   (vii) contain  amplifier circuit at sensor end, and   (viii)  require a large  space at  site  for installation,<br>
The object of the  invention  is to provide an  instrumen1 which is relatively inexpensive,  easily repairable,  sensitive, not liable to be damaged through inadvertent operational   errors, fast-responsive,   and  is   particularly  suitable for use  in  steel plants  for increasing  the   productivity   and  reducing  the wastage of  materials through control  of the  processes.<br><br>
The invented instrument is called "SAIL-PHOS". It is built in two separate units, namely 'sensor1 and 'monitor1, which are inter-connected electrically through a 2 or 3-wire cable.<br>
The sensor unit is built in a metallic casing of typical dimensions 6mm {dia) x 20 mm (L) or 25x25x15mm or 100x50x25mm, and is provided with a focussing hood of preferred length 50 or 100 or 150mm optional to allow only the desired light/heat rays from an object to enter into it through a focussing lense of preferred diameter 5 to 10mm and fall on a photo transistor provided in the unit , the electrical output of which is amplified by means of an electronic circuit connected to the photo transistor, comprising only a relatively few components and kept inthe monitor unit. The casing of the sensor unit is mounted on a stand which is rotatable both in the horizontal and vertical planes for directing the hood towards the object to be detected. The sensor unit is suitable for operation at an ambient temperature upto 90°C without using any cooling jacket. A cooling jacket is provided for using the sensing unit at an ambient temperature above 90°C.<br>
The amplified electrical output of the photo transistor is compared against a threshold signal supplied to the sensor unit from the monitor unit, and the photo transistor output, which is in excess of the threshold signal level, is produced at the output of the sensor unit and fed at input of the monitor unit.<br><br>
At least one 3V bulb is provided in the sensor unit, for testing operating condition of instrument when no light rays  are received from an object to be detected.<br>
With a view to ensuring the safety of the operating personnel during adjustment of the focussing direction of the hood of the sensor unit at site,  only a low d.c. voltage supply of around  12V is provided in the sensor unit.<br>
The monitor unit which is meant for installation at a central  place such as the electrical control room/electrical machine hall/computer room pulpits, which may be at an appreciable distance away from the location of the object to be detected by the sensor unit,  the electrical connection between the two units i.e. sensor and monitor,  is made by means of an adequately long 2/3-wire cable, which may be screened or not screened.<br>
The power supply to the monitor unit is 220V,   A«C-mains.    The output of the sensor unit supplied to the input of the monitor unit is received optionally through an opto-coupler provided in the monitor unit for electrically isolating the sensor unit from the monitor unit.<br>
The output of the opto-coupler when used or that of sensor unit when the opto-coupler is not used is fed to a relay and an open-collector transistor,  after being amplified through a high current-gain amplifier.    The monitor unit contains a potentiometer for controlling the level of the threshold signal supplied to the sensor unit.<br><br>
A test signal is available from the monitor unit for testing the operating conditions of the sensor unit, as well as the cable connecting the sensor unit with the monitor unit and the monitor unit itself, when no object is present in the viewing zone of the sensor unit.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 is the electrical circuit diagram of the sensor unit; and<br>
Figure 2 is the electrical circuit diagram of the monitor unit.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the sensor unit contains a photo transistor P, the output voltage of which is fed at the input terminals 12, 13 of IC1. The output of IC1 obtained at terminal 14 is fed to the input terminal 10 of IC2 through resistor R5.<br>
A part of the output of IC1 is fed back from terminal 14 to terminal 13 through resistor R4.<br>
A part of the output of IC2 obtained at its terminal 8 is fed back to its input terminal 9 through the gain control potentiometer P1 and resistors R9 and R6. The output of IC2 at its terminal 8 is available at terminal TP1 and is supplied also to the input terminal 5 of IC3, through resistor R7, which acts as a comparator to block the signal at terminal 5, which is of lower strength than the threshold signal fed at terminal 6 of IC3.<br><br>
A Part of the  output of IC3  obtained   at  terminal   7 is fed back to  its  input terminal 5 through resistor R8.     The output of IC3 at terminal 7 is supplied to base   (b) of<br>
transistor T2 through resistor R14.     Transistor T2 is     connected<br>
e-in grounded-amitter and open-collector mode.    The output of T2,<br>
obtained  at terminal  SL1,   is  connected  to  the  opto-coupler unit (OC)  of type MCT2 shown in Fig.  2,<br>
Threshold voltage  obtained  at  terminal TH of  sensor unit from the monitor unit   (Fig.  2) is fed  at  terminal  3 of IC4 through resistor R3     The output  signal  at terminal  1   of IC4 is connected to terminal 6 of IC3 which acts  as  a threshold comparator for comparing  the threshold  signal  against  the   photo-transistor atignal(Fig.   1).<br>
Referring  to  Fig.   2,   the  signal  received  from terminal SL1  of the sensor unit   (Fig.   1) is  connected to terminal 3 of the opto-coupler unit OC   (type MCT2),   provided  in the monitor unit.     The opto-coupler is  used to electrically isolate the sensor unit from the monitor unit.    The capacitor C3 connected between  terminal 7 and  ground  of the  opto-coupler unit  is   meant for by-passing  the transient surge voltages.in  the  signal received from terminal  SL1  of the sensor unit.    Voltage VCC  is supplied to  terminal 8 of the opto-coupler directly and  to terminals  2 and 6 of the opto-coupler through resistors  R26 and R27 respectively.     The  terminal 5  of  opto-coupler is  connected to   ground.     The output  signal   at terminal  6 of opto-coupler is fed  at terminal  13  of 1C5.     The  output  obtained   at  terminal   1A of IC5  is connected to base   (b)  of transistor T6  in  two ways,<br><br>
namely, directly through junction J1,  resistor R28,and through IC6,   junction J2 and resistor R28.    The output obtained at emitter  (e) of T5 is supplied to base  (b) of transistors T3 and T7 each through resistors R2A and R25 respectively.<br>
Transistor T3 is connected in grounded-emitter {e) and open-collector  (c) mode,  and provides output at terminal OC through switch S1.    The output obtained at collector  (c) of T7» which is connected in grounded-emitter  (e) mode, is  supplied to relay RL.    Diode D6 is connected across the relay to discharge the back e.m.f.  generated in the relay during switching off of the switch S2.    Resistor R23 and diode D5 act as collector load of T7.<br>
A dc voltage which is adjustable by potentiometer P2 is  supplied from VCC to the input terminal 5 of IC7  (optional), the output of which obtained at terminal 7 thereof is fed at base   (b) of transistor TA   (optional) which is connected in open collector  {c) configuration.    The voltage obtained at the collector  (c) of TA is available at terminal TH as the threshold voltage which is provided at terminal TH of the sensor unit (Fig.  1).    In this way,  the photo transistor output produced by stray light rays is  cancelled by IC3   (Fig.  1)  in its  output at terminal 7.<br>
The power supply section   (Fig.  2) comprises transformer Tr,  diodes D1,  D2,  D3,  D4,  Capacitors C1,  C2,   L.E.D*    V7, register R19, voltage regulator VRand generates a dc voltage (12V) at terminal VCC,  from the A-C- mains voltage 220V supplied at terminals L and N.    VCC is  connected  to terminal 5 of IC7<br><br>
through diode D8 and to terminal 10 of IC8 from the Junction of resistors R17 and R18 when the test press button PB is pressed.<br>
An auxiliary light source 3V bulb is provided in the sensor unit (Fig. 1) for testing the operating condition of the sensor unit (Fig. 1), monitor unit (Fig. 2) and the Cable used for connecting the sensor unit with the monitor unit, when an object to be detected by the instrument is not present at a given location in the plant.<br>
The instrument is provided with a base plate having four holes one each at the four corners thereof for fixing the same with similar plates mounted at different locations in the plant, where the instrument is to be fixed by means of nuts and bolts.<br>
In operating the instrument, the power supply in the monitor unit is switched on, the press button PB is pressed, the potentiometer P1 (Fig. 1) and P2 (Fig. 2) are adjusted to ensure that the L.E.D. glows in the test mode of the instrument.<br>
Suitable focussing distances of the instruments from different objects to be detected and the temperature of the said objects are presented in Table I.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
