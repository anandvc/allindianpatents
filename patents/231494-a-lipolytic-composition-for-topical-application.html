      PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
      (See Section 10)<br><br>
COSMETIC COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the invention<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a lipolytic composition for topical application that provides sebum / oil control on the skin and particularly relates to providing anti-cellulite benefits.<br>
Background and Prior art<br>
Many people perceive oiliness of the skin as an undesirable condition. Additionally many people seek relief from a condition known as cellulite where there is deposition of fat near the surface of the skin. Although many medical and therapeutic solutions have been suggested for removal of cellulite, many people prefer a cosmetic solution to the perceived problem since cosmetic solutions are perceived to be milder, with fewer side effects while providing the desired benefits.<br>
Excess lipid or fat accumulation near the surface of the skin is a problem associated with increased fat deposits in adipocytes, as well as increased sebum secretion from sebocytes. Thus delivery of lipolytic agents through cosmetic compositions which can be topically applied may cause lipolysis thereby decreasing the amount of lipid present in these cells, thus providing the benefits of cellulite reduction.<br>
Cellulite is fat that is deposited in pockets just below the surface of the skin. It is a result of increase in volume of adipocytes (fat cells) within the skin. The histological studies of subcutanous tissues suggest that the fat lobules (groups of adipose cells sheathed in connective tissue) are larger, and less restricted lobules, leading to an outward pressing against the dermis causing the bumps characteristic of cellulite. Concurrent with adipose deposition, venous capillaries tend to form microaneurisms while adjacent vessels become dilated. As blood flow is reduced, the capillary walls become leaky and leading to an increase in the infiltration of water in the tissue. Together, these result in a bumpy skin surface and spongy texture.<br>
2<br><br>
Fat is stored in special fat cells called adipocytes located all over the body. There are anywhere from 25 billion to 275 billion adipocytes. The average individual has around 30-35 billion. The adipocyte is a metabblically active cell that plays a central role in the control of the energetic balance. For this purpose, it possesses all the enzymes necessary for synthesis (lipogenesis) and for triglyceride storage, mobilization and liberation as free fatty acids (lipolysis). When adipocytes release fat (lipolysis), the adipocyte gets smaller, and when they store fat, the adipocyte gets larger (lipogenesis). Reducing the quantity of subcutaneous fat by stimulating basal lipolysis can therefore reduce the manifestations of cellulite.<br>
Lipolysis corresponds to the hydrolysis of triglycerides in free fatty acids and in glycerol. This reaction is catalyzed by a key enzyme: HSL (Hormone-sensitive Lipase). The determining signal required to trigger lipolysis is cyclic AMP (cAMP). The intracellular concentration of cAMP depends on two opposed action systems: adenylate cyclase (AC) which activates it, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) which cleaves it into 5,-AMP. Therefore a substance which is capable of stimulating adenylate cyclase or inhibiting phosphodiesterase will raise the intracellular cAMP levels, which activates the HSL enzyme and stimulates the lipolysis of fats by the adipocyte. E.g. caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase and thus encourages the synthesis of the cAMP which stimulates the lipolysis.<br>
There have been a few reports of lipolytic agents delivered through compositions for topical application. W09947112 (P &amp; G, 1999) describes a method for treating and/or preventing cellulite by administering a safe and effective amount of a skin care composition to a mammal having or prone to forming cellulite, comprising: (a) a safe and effective amount of niacinamide, and (b) a dermatologically acceptable carrier for the niacimamide. This patent also claims a method wherein additional actives are used which is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor selected from the group consisting of theophylline, caffeine, theobromine, salts thereof and mixtures thereof.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2002098436 (Indena, 2002) describes pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic compositions for the treatment of localized adiposities and cellulite which contain a combination of the following active principles: (a) complex of escin/beta-sitosterol with phospholipids, (b) complex of gingko biloba dimeric flavonoids with phospholipids, (c) complex of centella asiatica triterpenes with phospholipids, and optionally one or both of (d) ethyl ximeninate, (e) coleus forskolii standard extract.<br>
CN 1348758 (Shanghai Jiahua Union, 2002) describes a composition containing melatonin and beta-dextran in certain proportions to form a skin anti wrinkle composition, the said two substances possess synergistic action mutually to give greater effect than by single substance. It is claimed here that compared to cosmetics containing vitamin A, vitamin E and ginseng extract alone, the wrinkle elimination effect can raise 15-20 %.<br>
While the first two publications, above mentioned are directed to reducing fat on the skin the last publication which comprises melatonin is directed to anti-wrinkling. Thus although some composition are disclosed in the art for fat and cellulite, there exists a need for developing more effective compositions for topical application which will provide lipolytic benefits and combat the condition of oily skin and cellulite. It is thus an object of the invention to provide for more effective compositions for topical application which give benefit in oiliness reduction and works effectively as an anti-cellulite product.<br>
The present inventors have through extensive experimentation and research developed compositions comprising melatonin that has been identified to have highly effective lipolytic efficacy. The present inventors have also developed synergistic compositions comprising melatonin and other known lipolytic agents that can be applied on the skin for lipolytic benefit.<br>

9<br><br>
On the fifth day, 100 µl per well of a differentiation media was added which has<br>
DMEM along with 10% fetal calf serum with 4.5 g/l glucose and 0.5 mM isobutyl<br>
methyl xanthine and 1 µM dexamethasone and 10 µg/l insulin.<br>
On the seventh day, 100 µ.l per well of differentiation media was added.<br>
On the eleventh day, 100 µ\ per well of a maintenance media was added which<br>
has DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum along with 4.5g/l glucose and 10 \x\fm\ of insulin.<br>
On the thirteenth day, 100 µ\ per well of the maintenance media was added.<br>
On the fifteenth day, 100 µl per well of DMEM along with 10% FCS with high<br>
glucose was added along with 5 µ\ per well of the active being tested.<br>
On the seventeenth day, the plates were washed twice with PBS.  50 \i\ per well<br>
of 4% formaldehyde in PBS was added for 20 minutes at room temperature and<br>
then washed twice with distilled water.  50 |al per well of diluted red O dye (three<br>
parts of 0.5% oil red O dye dissolved in isopropanol with two parts of distilled<br>
water) and allowed to stain for two hours at 37 °C. The samples were washed 3<br>
to 4 times with distilled water.  50 ml per well of isopropanol was added and the<br>
dye was allowed to dissolve for 15 minutes at room temperature.   The OD<br>
(optical   density)   of  the   samples   were   measured   at   540   nm   using   a<br>
spectrophotometer. The data are represented as percentage of a control sample<br>
which is taken to have 100% activity.<br>
Examples 1 and 2<br>
The lipolytic activity of melatonin at a few concentrations were determined using<br>
the above described assay and the data are summarized in Table 1.<br>

The data in Table-3 indicates that a rubefacient agent like methyl nicotinate when taken along with melatonin provides for synergistic lipolytic activity (Example 11) as compared to the activity obtained when the actives were taken individually.<br>
11<br><br>
Example 12,13<br>
An experiment was conducted with a mixture of known lipolytic actives and a rubefacient agent and the results obtained were compared to the activity obtained when melatonin was added to it. The data is summarized in table -4<br>
Table-4<br><br>
Active	Ex-12	Ex-13<br>
	wt%	wt%<br>
Melatonin	-	0.005<br>
