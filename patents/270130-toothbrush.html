FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, and more particularly, to a powered toothbrush configured for ease of use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powered toothbrushes generally have a movable head that is motor-driven from a handle. While such toothbrushes usually achieve a more intensive cleaning action than manual toothbrushes, they may be uncomfortable for users due to transmission of motor vibrations to the hand of the user.<br>
[0003] These problems are magnified in that adult powered toothbrushes rnav be<br>
uncomfortable for some users, such as children. In particular, the anatomical structure of children generally provides insufficient musculoskeletal strength or control of the hands or fingers to effectively manipulate adult electric toothbrushes. Further, the differences in the oral cavity size and tooth configurations between children and adults make it difficult for children to use adult toothbrushes. Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement economically configured for children.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] There is provided an ergonoraic toothbrush for the anatomical structures of children.<br>
[0005] In one embodiment, a resilient sleeve covers at least a portion of a toothbrush handle to provide comfort for the user. In other embodiments, a resilient sleeve has three-dimensional sculpture shapes or two dimensional graphics to provide a visually appealing product with reduced vibration transmission to a user's hand.<br>
[0006] In another embodiment, a toothbrush includes user replaceable sections or covers enabling selective tailoring of the visual appearance.   In yet another embodiment, a toothbrush is configured for exposure of products by providing regions for<br>
placement of advertising or other promotional material. In one embodiment, a toothbrush has three dimensional sections in visually appealing or recognizable shapes for promoting more frequent brushing by children. Other embodiments include other features as a way of enticing children to become interested in the toothbrush and brushing in general.<br>

[0018] Referring to FIG. 1, a powered toothbrush includes a handle or grip body<br>
collectively defined by a top portion 1 and a base portion 3. The handle can be defined by a unitary molded construction or two handle halves or other multiple components. An internal motor chassis 2 and a power source such as a battery 4 are retained within a cavity in the handle formed by the top and base portions 1,3.<br>
[0019] Top portion 1 includes a handle upper portion 5 connected to a neck portion 6 and a rotating head 7 provided with tooth cleaning elements 9. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the neck portion 6 generally extends from where the handle upper portion 5 begins to taper inwardly toward the shaft 25 (FIG. 2), to the base of the head 7. Head 7 is operatively connected to the internal motor chassis 2 by any desired construction such as, for example, by a shaft 25, and can provide tooth cleaning movement, such as vibrations, oscillations and the like. Non -limiting examples of tooth cleaning elements 9 can include filament bristles or elastomeric fingers or walls which are used for wiping, cleaning and/or massaging the user's oral tissue.<br>
[0020] Base portion 3 includes a mating portion 13 that reliably mates with a<br>
complementary mating portion 30 of the top portion 1 so as to enclose the internal motor chassis 2 and other components. Mating portion 13 includes an "O" ring seal for providing water tightness in the handle cavity and/or for a snug interference fit between the top portion 1 and base portion 3. Other mating connections are possible.<br>
[0021] As shown in FIG. 2, an outer switch section 12 is provided for activating and deactivating the motor 2 and movement of tooth cleaning elements 9.   Outer switch 12, such as a push button, contacts and causes an interior switch 11 to activate the internal motor of internal motor chassis 2. Outer switch 12 comprises an outer layer polymeric material that is preferably shaped in an ornamental nature (e.g., stars, swirls, flowers) with other ornamental features along a specific theme as will be discussed below.<br>
[0022] In one embodiment, a ratio of the length of the neck portion 6 and head 7 to the height of the toothbrush (measured from the distal bottom end 32 of base portion 3 to the distal top 34 of head section 7) ranges from 1:10 to 2:5. In another non-limiting example, the noted neck/head length to the toothbrush height ratio ranges from 1:20 to 1:30, with other ratios being possible. In one embodiment, the external height of the toothbrush ergonomically sized for a child ranges from about 160cm to 200cm. In other non-limiting embodiments, the height of a toothbrush ranges from about 160cm to 194 cm; to less than 194 cm, with other heights being possible. In one embodiment, the width of the handle can range between 19 cm to 28 cm. In another embodiment, the depth of the handle ranges between 19 cm to 27 cm, or between 19 cm to 21 cm. These ergonomic configurations provide for a toothbrush to have a neck/head to length ratio to reach within the depth of the oral cavity, while balancing the need for musculoskeletal strength of a child to manipulate the toothbrush. Accordingly, these configurations or combination thereof enable a lightweight and easily maneuverable electric toothbrush for children.<br>
[0023] As shown in FIGS. 3-4, a resilient sleeve 16 is configured to fit over an electric toothbrush. Sleeve 16 provides for increased user comfort by dampening vibration transmissions of the electric toothbrush to the hand of the user, and/or provides obvious ornamental appearance benefits that are found particularly attractive by children. Of course, sleeve 16 can be used with manual toothbrushes as desired to impart aesthetic appeal. A distal end 36 of sleeve 16 extends along a portion of the head 7, and in one embodiment attaches to a connection portion 8 at the distal top 34 of the head 7 (HO. 1) for an interference or snug fit. In such a construction, the sleeve 16 has a tab or protrusion (not shown) which extends away from the inside surface of the sleeve so as to be received in the connection portion 8 of the toothbrush. The connection portion 8 can be an appropriately sized depression or notch in the toothbrush head 7. Of course, the sleeve 16 may attach to head 7 in other ways as desired.<br>
[0024] The sleeve 16 is preferably constructed from a resilient material including, but not<br>
limited to a thermoplastic elastomer, rubber, SANTOPRENE® and the like. Other resilient materials may be used based on specific desired sleeve properties, including but not limited to a desired Shore Hardness A rating, such as between 20-30. In one embodiment, the sleeve 16 is formed with three dimensional contouring 19 along a predetermined theme. For example, the theme may be simulations of characters, celebrities, cartoon or other animated characters, mass media figures, geometric figures, logos, or other such shapes. The sleeve 16 has an outer topography with sufficient physical shape variations in the contour, holes or apertures to create a sculptured three-dimensional appearance. In another embodiment, the sleeve 16 may be designed to provide a large surface area on which can be placed advertising or other promotional material. For example, the exposed outer surface or portions of the outer surface of the sleeve 16 are enabled to receive graphical labeling. In one embodiment, the outer surface or portions of sleeve 16 can be generally smooth for receiving the labeling.<br>
[0025] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, in one embodiment, sleeve 16 may contain one or<br>
more opened areas or apertures 18 through the thickness which is devoid of sleeve material. One of the aperture features 18 of sleeve 16 exposes the external portion of graphical section 17 of the toothbrush (e.g., three-dimensional or two-dimensional graphical features), and is provided to be complementary to one or more graphical sections 17 on the bottom portion 3 of the toothbrush handle. As seen in the FIG. 3, the aperture 18 for the bottom portion is devoid of the material in the front of the toothbrush, but is preferably closed in the rear side of the toothbrush. The closed rear side enables, for example, improved gripping of the toothbrush. Nevertheless, the opened area 18 can be provided for other portions such as the top portion of the toothbrush handle as shown.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment, the graphical section 17 is composed of a material and<br>
construction to provide an ornamental aesthetic shape. The graphical section 17 can be molded with the base portion 3 thereby forming a generally unitary element (FIGS. 5A-5B). In another embodiment, the graphical section 17 can be formed with an elastomeric material having a Shore hardness A value ranging<br>
from 20 to 30. In alternative embodiments shown in FIGS. 6A-8B, graphical section 17 is a replaceable and/or interchangeable insert for the base portion 3. In such an interchangeable construction, the graphical section may be formed as a resilient contoured removable plate 26.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the bottom portion 3 can be of a contoured shape in order to provide a thematic representation with the remainder of the toothbrush handle, such as the top portion 1. The bottom portion 3 can be composed of a polymeric or elastomeric material 29 that provides a three dimensional visual representation, alone or in combination with a three dimensional shape of top portion 1.  In such a construction, bottom portion 3 can have a three dimensional shape and/or color which resemble cartoon characters, logos, mass media figures, sports team mascots and the like along the overall entertainment theme of the toothbrush. For example, in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the toothbrush generally simulates a stylized representation of a totem pole or a cartoon bird. In particular, the bottom portion 3 of the toothbrush resembles a head of a cartoon bird and the remainder of the toothbrush handle resembles the body of a cartoon bird. In this way, a child is more apt to regularly use toothbrushes that are not only more comfortable, but are also visually appealing with shapes or colors.<br>
[0028] In another embodiment, the top portion 1 of a toothbrush includes a finger rest region 20 provided in a depression (FIGS. 5B, 6B, 7B, and 8B). This enables a user to reliably control the direction of toothbrush in the oral cavity and provide better pressure application to the oral tissue. In an embodiment, the rest region 20 has a tactile feature to increase the friction on the user's finger surfaces and enhance the user's ability to grip the handle, particularly under wet conditions. In other embodiments, the rest region 20 includes projections 22 (FIG. 7B) or strip projections 24 (FIG. 8B), to provide improved user control while minimizing accidental slipping through a user's finger.<br>
[0029] In one embodiment shown in FIGS. 9A, 9B and 10, sleeve 16 includes a stand 21, on which the toothbrush can be placed when not in use to avoid contacting head<br><br>
section 7 or bristles 9 with germs, bacteria, or other infectious agents present on restroom surfaces. Stand 21 may be integrally molded with sleeve 16 to a resilient releasable construction. In operation, the releasable stand 21 flips from a rest or first position along sleeve 16 (FIG. 9A) to a deployed position (FIG. 9B). Hence, the stand 21 is able to flip open into an in-use deployed position to hold the toothbrush substantially upright. In FIG. 10, stand 21 could be a separate component with three-dimensional contouring and can be connected to the remainder of sleeve 16 using any appropriate connecting methods known to those in the art.<br>
[0030] In one embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11, aplurality of base portions 103-107 or graphical sections, can be sold or otherwise provided together as a system or kit 100 along a predetermined theme. Accordingly, the toothbrush and base portions 103-107 or graphical sections can be provided in an enclosure, such as box. In other constructions, a plurality of sleeves and/or base portions, alone or in combination may be provided in specific packages or subject area classifications, such as professional and amateur sports, entertainment, music, motion picture, business, print and electronic media, politics, or computing gaming, for example. In this way, toothbrush advantageously enhances a child's ability to use their imagination in a positive manner to improve oral care.<br>
[0031] In yet another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 12, a plurality of sleeves 203-207 can be provided as a kit 200 for a toothbrush.   In operation, a user may substitute a first sleeve 203 with another sleeve 205 or 207 with different visual appearances or textual compositions. For example, a kit may contain sleeves along a common theme a particular mass media show or program, but have different characters or features of the show. Thus, for example, the stylized sculptural representation of a show character could be formed by contours and/or variations in thickness of sleeve 16. Various different sleeves could be provided to enable a purchaser the ability to select his or her favorite or sleeve shapes. In these ways, a consumer is provided with a kit having a system that can be used for a variety of thematic functions. Advantageously, the consumer can selectively change the appearance<br>
of a toothbrush at a desired time period and to entice a child to be interested in brushing their teeth. In a further advantage, marketing and promotional activities can be greatly enhanced with the interchangeable constructions of sleeves and bottom portions.<br>
[0032] Hence, a child can use the three-dimensional graphical section 17 or sleeve 16 for entertainment which is believed to provide increased use of the toothbrush for improved oral care. In one construction, the appearance of the toothbrush can have various predetermined themes or simulations of popular toys or mass media associated with children, such as television shows and computer games with action figures or other characters<br><br><br><br><br><br>
