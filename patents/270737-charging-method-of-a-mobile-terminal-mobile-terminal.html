				<td>CHARGING METHOD FOR A MOBILE TERMINAL<br>
FIELD OF ART<br>
[0001] The claimed subject matter relates to a charging method for a mobile terminal<br>
having a solar cell.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Mobile terminals are conveniently portable and have one or more of functions<br>
for supporting voice and video calls, communicating information, storing data, etc.<br>
Multifunctional mobile terminals can capture still images or moving images, play music or<br>
video files, play games, receive broadcast messages, essentially acting as an integrated<br>
multimedia player or device.<br>
[0003] Attempts have been made to implement said multimedia features in the form of<br>
hardware or software integrated into a mobile terminal. For example, a user interface<br>
environment is provided in order for users to easily and conveniently retrieve or select the<br>
related functions. Typically, a rechargeable battery is connected to the mobile terminal as a<br>
power source. When the battery is completely discharged, the battery needs to be recharged.<br>
Solar cells have been proposed for recharging the battery of a mobile terminal.<br>
[0004] The recharge rate is dependent on the brightness of the ambient light<br>
surrounding a mobile terminal. When the mobile terminal is operated in an excessively low<br>
luminance environment, the battery is discharged more rapidly than the time needed to<br>
recharge the battery via the solar cells.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] In accordance with one or more embodiments, a charging method of a mobile<br>
terminal is provided. The method comprises detecting brightness of ambient light around the<br>
mobile terminal by an illumination sensor of the mobile terminal; activating a charging circuit<br>
for charging a battery of the mobile terminal when the detected brightness is more than a first<br>
value; measuring a generated current of a solar cell; and deactivating the charging circuit when<br>
the generated current of the solar cell is below a second value.<br>
[0006] The illumination sensor is positioned at a first surface of body of the mobile<br>
terminal, wherein the first surface has a display, and the solar cell is positioned at a second<br>
surface of the body of the terminal. The method further comprises comparing a previously<br>
detected brightness by the illumination sensor with the first value when the detected brightness<br>
by the illumination sensor is less than the first value. If the previously detected brightness is<br>
greater than the first value, power is supplied to the charging circuit. If the previously detected<br>
brightness is greater than the first value, an audio or visual signal is generated to alert a user. If<br>
the generated current by the solar cell is less than the second value, and the detected brightness<br>
by the illumination sensor is more than the first value, an audio or visual signal is generated to<br>
alert a user. In one embodiment, if the generated current by the solar cell is less than the second<br>
value, when the detected brightness by the illumination sensor is more than the first value, the<br>
charging circuit is deactivated.<br>
[0007] The mobile terminal may comprise a first terminal body and a second terminal<br>
body coupled to the first terminal body in a folding configuration, wherein the illumination<br>
sensor and a display of the mobile terminal are positioned on an inner face of the first terminal<br>
body in a closed state, and the solar cell is positioned on an external surface of the second<br>
terminal body. If the first terminal body is open from the second terminal body, whether to<br>
operate the charging circuit is determined based upon brightness detected by the illumination<br>
sensor. If the first terminal body is in a closed state with respect to the second terminal body, a<br>
previously detected brightness is compared to the first value. If the previously detected<br>
brightness is greater than the first value, the charging circuit is activated, and if the previously<br>
detected brightness is smaller than the first value, the currently generated current of the solar<br>
cell is compared to a second value. If the currently generated current of the solar cell is smaller<br>
than the second value, the amount of the generated current is rechecked a preset number of<br>
times, and thereafter if the rechecked generated current is smaller than the second value, the<br>
operation of the charging circuit is suspended.<br>
[0008] In accordance with one embodiment, a mobile terminal comprises a terminal<br>
main body; an illumination sensor mounted at a first surface of the terminal main body, the first<br>
surface provided with a display; a solar cell mounted at a second surface of the terminal main<br>
body; and a controller configured to control whether to operate a charging circuit for charging a<br>
battery based upon brightness detected by the illumination sensor and a generated current of the<br>
solar cell. The controller is configured to operate the charging circuit for charging the battery if<br>
the brightness detected by the illumination sensor is more than a reference brightness.<br>
[0010] The controller is configured to restrict the operation of the charging circuit if the<br>
generated current of the solar cell is less than reference current, when the brightness detected<br>
by the illumination sensor is more than reference brightness. The controller is configured to<br>
compare the previously detected value of the illumination sensor with a reference brightness if<br>
the brightness detected by the illumination sensor is less than the reference brightness, wherein<br>
if the previously detected value of the illumination sensor is greater than the reference<br>
brightness, the controller supplies power to the charging circuit, and if the previously detected<br>
value of the illumination sensor is smaller than the reference brightness, the controller controls<br>
the illumination sensor to redetect brightness.<br>
[0011] The controller is configured to generate an audio or visual signal, if the<br>
previously detected value of the illumination sensor is greater than reference brightness. The<br>
controller is configured generate an audio or visual signal if the generated current of the solar<br>
cell is less than a reference current even when the brightness detected by the illumination<br>
sensor is more than a reference brightness. The controller is configured to recheck the amount<br>
of the generated current a preset number of times if the currently generated current of the solar<br>
cell is smaller than a reference current, and thereafter if the rechecked generated current is<br>
smaller than the reference current, the controller is configured to restrict the operation of the<br>
charging circuit.<br>
[0012] A computer readable storage medium comprising executable logic code,<br>
wherein when the logic code is executed on a computer causes the computer to detect<br>
brightness of ambient light around the mobile terminal by an illumination sensor of the mobile<br>
terminal; activate a charging circuit for charging a battery of the mobile terminal when the<br>
detected brightness is more than a first value; measure a generated current of a solar cell; and<br>
deactivate the charging circuit when the generated current of the solar cell is below a second<br>
value.<br>

[0024] Description will now be given in detail of preferred configurations of mobile<br>
terminals according to the present invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Hereinafter, suffixes "module" and "unit or portion" for components used herein in description<br>
are merely provided only for facilitation of preparing this specification, and thus they are not<br>
granted a specific meaning or function. Hence, it should be noticed that "module" and "unit or<br>
portion" is used interchangeably.<br>
[0025] Referring to FIG. 1, a mobile terminal 100 in accordance with one embodiment<br>
may comprise components, such as a wireless communication unit 110, an Audio/Video (A/V)<br>
input unit 120, a user input unit 130, a sensing unit 140, an output unit 150, a memory 160, an<br>
interface unit 170, a controller 180, a power supply unit 190 and the like. FIG 1 shows the<br>
mobile terminal 100 having various components, but it is understood that inclusion all of the<br>
illustrated components is not a requirement. Greater or fewrer components may be included,<br>
depending on implementation.<br>
[0026] The wireless communication unit 110 may include one or more components<br>
which permit wireless communications between the mobile terminal 100 and a wireless<br>
communication system or between the mobile terminal 100 and a network within which the<br>
mobile terminal 100 is located. For example, the wireless communication unit 110 may include<br>
a broadcast receiving module 111, a mobile communication module 112, a wireless internet<br>
module 113, a short-range communication module 114, a position location module 115 and the<br>
like.<br>
[0027] The broadcast receiving module 111 receives a broadcast signal and/or<br>
broadcast associated information from an external broadcast managing entity via a broadcast<br>
channel. The broadcast channel may include a satellite channel and a terrestrial channel. The<br>
broadcast managing entity may indicate a server which generates and transmits a broadcast<br>
signal and/or broadcast associated information or a server which receives a pre-generated<br>
broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information and sends them to the mobile terminal.<br>
The broadcast associated information may indicate information relating to broadcast channels,<br>
broadcast programs or broadcast service providers.<br>
[0028] The broadcast signal may be implemented as a TV broadcast signal, a radio<br>
broadcast signal, and a data broadcast signal, among others. The broadcast signal may further<br>
include a data broadcast signal combined with a TV or radio broadcast sisnal. Further, the<br><br>
broadcast associated information may be provided via a mobile communication network and<br>
received by the mobile communication module 112. The broadcast associated information may<br>
be implemented in various formats. For instance, broadcast associated information may include<br>
Electronic Program Guide (EPG) of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), Electronic<br>
Service Guide (ESG) of Digital Video Broadcast-Handheld (DVB-H), and the like.<br>
[0029] The broadcast receiving module 111 may be configured to receive digital<br>
broadcast signals transmitted from various types of broadcast systems. Such broadcast systems<br>
may include Digital Multimedia Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DMB-T), Digital Multimedia<br>
Broadcasting-Satellite (DMB-S), Media Forward Link Only (MediaFLO), Digital Video<br>
Broadcast-Handheld (DVB-H), Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial (ISDB-T), and<br>
the like. The broadcast receiving module 111 may be configured to be suitable for every<br>
broadcast system transmitting broadcast signals as well as the digital broadcasting systems.<br>
Broadcast signals and/or broadcast associated information received via the broadcast receiving<br>
module 111 may be stored in a suitable device, such as a memory 160.<br>
[0030] The mobile communication module 112 transmits/receives wireless signals<br>
to/from at least one of network entities (e.g., base station, an external terminal, a server, etc.) on<br>
a mobile communication network. Here, the wireless signals may include audio call signal,<br>
video call signal, or various formats of data according to transmission/reception of<br>
text/multimedia messages. The wireless internet module 113 supports wireless Internet access<br>
for the mobile terminal. This module may be internally or externally coupled to the mobile<br>
terminal 100. Examples of such wireless Internet access may include Wireless LAN (WLAN)<br>
(Wi-Fi), Wireless Broadband (Wibro), World Interoperability for Microwave Access (Wimax),<br>
High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), and the like.<br>
[0031] The short-range communication module 114 denotes a module for short-range<br>
communications. Suitable technologies for implementing this module may include<br>
BLUETOOTH, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), Infrared Data Association (IrDA),<br>
Ultra-WideBand (UWB), ZigBee, and the like. The position location module 115 denotes a<br>
module for detecting or calculating a position of a mobile terminal. An example of the position<br>
location module 115 may include a Global Position System (GPS) module. According to the<br>
current technology, the GPS module 115 can measure accurate time and distance respectively<br><br>
from more than three satellites and apply a triangulation scheme to the measured information<br>
so as to accurately calculate a three-dimensional current position of the mobile terminal on<br>
latitude, longitude and altitude.<br>
[0032] The A/V input unit 120 is configured to provide audio or video signal input to<br>
the mobile terminal. The A/V input unit 120 may include a camera 121 and a microphone 122.<br>
The camera 121 receives and processes image frames of still pictures or video obtained by<br>
image sensors in a video (telephony) call mode or a capturing mode. The processed image<br>
frames may be displayed on a display 151. The image frames processed by the camera 121 may<br>
be stored in the memory 160 or transmitted to the exterior via the wireless communication unit<br>
110. Two or more cameras 121 may be provided according to the configuration of the mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
[0033] The microphone 122 may receive an external audio signal while the mobile<br>
terminal is in a particular mode, such as a phone call mode, a recording mode, a voice<br>
recognition mode, or the like. This audio signal is processed into digital data. The processed<br>
digital data is converted for output into a format transmittable to a mobile communication base<br>
station via the mobile communication module 112 in case of the phone call mode. The<br>
microphone 122 may include assorted noise removing algorithms to remove noise generated in<br>
the course of receiving the external audio signal.<br>
[0034] The user input unit 130 may generate input data input by a user to control the<br>
operation of the mobile terminal. The user input unit 130 may include a keypad, a dome switch,<br>
a touchpad (e.g., static pressure/capacitance), a jog wheel, a jog switch and the like. In<br>
particular, the touch pad is layered with the display 151 to cooperate with each other, which<br>
may be referred to as a touch screen.<br>
[0035] The sensing unit 140 provides status measurements of various aspects of the<br>
mobile terminal. For instance, the sensing unit 140 may detect an open/close status of the<br>
mobile terminal, a change in a location of the mobile terminal 100, a presence or absence of<br>
user contact with the mobile terminal 100, the orientation of the mobile terminal 100,<br>
acceleration/deceleration of the mobile terminal 100, and the like, so as to generate a sensing<br>
signal for controlling the operation of the mobile terminal 100. For example, regarding a slide-<br>
type mobile terminal, the sensing unit 140 may sense whether a sliding portion of the mobile<br><br>
terminal is open or closed. Other examples include sensing functions, such as the sensing unit<br>
140 sensing the presence or absence of power provided by the power supply 190, the presence<br>
or absence of a coupling or other connection between the interface unit 170 and an external<br>
device and the like.<br>
[0036] The sensing unit 140 may further include an illumination sensor (illuminance<br>
sensor, ambient light sensor) 141, which will be explained later, for control of the power supply<br>
190. The illumination sensor 141 may serve as a primary information collecting device which<br>
senses or detects ambient brightness of the mobile terminal 100 so as to determine whether to<br>
operate a charging circuit 191 implementing the power supply 190. The illumination sensor<br>
141 may detect the ambient brightness of the display 151 so as to provide the controller 180<br>
with basic information for adjusting brightness of the display 151. The controller 180 may then<br>
increase the brightness of the display 151 when the result detected by the illumination sensor is<br>
higher than a reference value while decreasing the brightness of the display 151 if the result is<br>
lower than the reference value.<br>
[0037] The brightness information detected by the illumination sensor 141 may be<br>
stored in the memory 160, which can be used as data required for comparison between current<br>
brightness and prior (past) brightness. The interface unit 170 is generally implemented to<br>
interface the mobile terminal 100 to external devices. For instance, the interface unit 170 may<br>
include, for example, wired/wireless headset ports, external charger ports, wired/wireless data<br>
ports, a memory card port, ports for connecting a device with an identification module, audio<br>
Input/Output (I/O) ports, video I/O ports, earphone ports, and the like.<br>
[0038] The identification module may be configured as a chip for storing various<br>
information required to authenticate an authority to use the mobile terminal 100, which may<br>
include a User Identity Module (UIM), a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), a Universal<br>
Subscriber Identity Module (USIM), and the like. Also, the device having the identification<br>
module (hereinafter, referred to as 'identification device*) may be implemented in a type of<br>
smart card. Hence, the identification device can be coupled to the mobile terminal 100 via a<br>
port. Further, the interface unit 170 may receive data from an external device, or be provided<br>
with power and accordingly transfer the received data or power to each component within the<br>
mobile terminal 100 or transfer data of the mobile terminal 100 to an external device.<br><br>
[0039] Also, the interface unit 170 may serve as a path for power to be supplied from<br>
an external cradle to the mobile terminal 100 when the mobile terminal 100 is connected to the<br>
external cradle or as a path for transferring various command signals input from the cradle by a<br>
user to the mobile terminal 100. Such various command signals and power input from the<br>
cradle may operate as a signal for recognizing that the mobile terminal 100 has accurately been<br>
mounted to the cradle. The output unit 150 is configured to output an audio signal, a video<br>
signal or an alarm signal. The output unit 150 may include a display 151, an audio output<br>
module 152, an alarm 153 and the like.<br>
[0040] The display 151 may output information processed in the mobile terminal 100.<br>
For example, when the mobile terminal is operating in a phone call mode, the display 151 will<br>
provide a User Interface (UI) or a Graphic User Interface (GUI) which includes information<br>
associated with the call. As another example, if the mobile terminal is in a video call mode or a<br>
capturing mode, the display 151 may additionally or alternatively display images captured<br>
and/or received, UI. or GUI. Also, the display 151 may visibly output an electricity-charged<br>
state generated from a solar cell 193 based upon information detected, respectively, by the<br>
illumination sensor 141 and a current monitor 192.<br>
[0041] In the meantime, as mentioned above, if the display 151 is layered with a touch<br>
pad to cooperate with each other so as to configure a touch screen, the display 151 may be used<br>
as an input unit as well as an output unit. The display 151 may be implemented using, for<br>
example, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-<br>
LCD), an Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED), a flexible display, a three-dimensional (3D)<br>
display, or the like. Some of the displays can be configured to be transparent such that it is<br>
possible to see the exterior therethrough. These displays may be called transparent displays. A<br>
representative example of the transparent display may include a Transparent Organic Light<br>
Emitting Diode (TOLED), and the like. The touch screen may be implemented to detect a touch<br>
pressure as well as a touch position and a touch area.<br>
[0042] A proximity sensor 141 may be disposed in the touch screen or near the touch<br>
screen. The proximity sensor 141 denotes a sensor for detecting whether there is an object<br>
approaching a certain detection surface or existing near the certain detection surface by using a<br>
force of an electromagnetic field or infrared ravs, without any mechanical contact. Even<br><br>
without the proximity sensor 141 mounted, if an electrostatic touch screen is provided, the<br>
proximity of a pointer can be detected based upon the change in an electric field due to the<br>
proximity of the pointer.<br>
[0043] The audio output module 152 may output audio data which is received from the<br>
wireless communication unit 110 in various modes including call reception mode, call-placing<br>
(phone call) mode, recording mode, voice recognition mode, broadcast reception mode, and the<br>
like, or audio data stored in the memory 160. Also, the audio output module 152 may output an<br>
audio signal relating to a particular function (e.g., tone for call received, tone for message<br>
received, etc.) performed in the mobile terminal 100. The audio output module 152 may be<br>
implemented using a speaker, a buzzer, or the like.<br>
[0044] The audio output module 152 may be configured to output an audible<br>
announcement (indication) message to users based upon the result detected by the illumination<br>
sensor 141 and the current monitor 192. The alarm 153 may output a signal to inform a<br>
generation of event associated with the mobile terminal 100. Typical events may include call<br>
received, message received, user input received and the like. In addition to generating the audio<br>
or video signal, the alarm 153 may also inform the event generation in different manners, for<br>
example, by providing tactile sensations (e.g., vibration) to make a user identify the event<br>
generation. If a call signal or message is received, the alarm 153 may vibrate to inform the<br>
reception. Alternatively, upon a key signal being input, the alarm 153 may output a vibration as<br>
a feedback for the key signal input. The signal for informing the event generation may also be<br>
output via the display 151 or the audio output module 152.<br>
[0045] The memory 160 may store a program for the processing and control of the<br>
controller 180. Alternatively, the memory 160 may temporarily store input/output data (e.g.,<br>
phonebook data, messages, still images, video and the like). Also, the memory 160 may store<br>
data related to various patterns of vibrations and audio outputted upon the touch input on the<br>
touch screen. In addition, the memory 160 may store or update information relating to<br>
illuminance (brightness) according to the present invention. The controller 180 may access the<br>
illuminance related information stored in the memory 160 so as to read or write such<br>
information.<br><br>
[0046] The memory 160 may be implemented using any type of suitable storage<br>
medium including a flash memory type, a hard disk type, a multimedia card micro type, a<br>
memory card type (e.g., SD or DX memory), Random Access Memory (RAM), Static Random<br>
Access Memory (SRAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable<br>
Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM), magnetic<br>
memory, magnetic disk, optical disk, and the like. Also, the mobile terminal 100 may operate a<br>
web storage which performs the storage function of the memory 160 on the Internet.<br>
[0047] The controller 180 typically controls the overall operations of the mobile<br>
terminal. For example, the controller 180 performs the control and processing associated with<br>
voice calls, data communications, video calls, and the like. The controller 180 may include a<br>
multimedia module 181 which provides multimedia playback. The multimedia module 181<br>
may be configured as part of the controller 180 or as a separate component. The controller 180<br>
may also determine whether to operate a charging circuit 191 based upon the result sensed by<br>
the illumination sensor 141 and the result detected by the current monitor 192, and provides<br>
users or counterparties with pre-stored or transmitted contents through video output/audio<br>
output or vibration.<br>
[0048] The controller 180 can perform a pattern recognition processing so as to<br>
recognize writing or drawing input on the touch screen as text or image. The power supply 190<br>
may be provided with a solar cell 193 and a battery 194 so as to be allowed for self-electricity<br>
generation and charging the generated electricity (power) to the battery 194. The power<br>
charged in the battery 194 may be supplied to each component of the mobile terminal 100 or<br>
upon operation of a circuit under the control of the controller 180. Since the amount of current<br>
generated by the solar cell 193 depends on ambient brightness of the mobile terminal 100, in<br>
the present invention, when a current larger than a preset value is generated, the controller 180<br>
activates (operates, activates) the charging circuit 191 so as to charge electricity generated by<br>
the solar cell 193 to the battery 194.<br>
[0049] The power supply 190 may further be provided with the charging circuit 191 for<br>
charging the battery 194. An integrated circuit (IC) implementing the charging circuit 191<br>
needs minimum power consumed by itself for operation. The power supply 190 may further be<br>
provided with a current monitor 192 for controlling the charging circuit 191 in cooperation<br><br>
with the illumination sensor 141. The current monitor 192 may continuously store and analyze<br>
the amount of electricity generated while the solar cell 193 is operated. The controller 180 may<br>
primarily determine whether to operate the charging circuit 191 based upon the detected result<br>
from the illumination sensor 141 as mentioned above, and. regulate the operation of the<br>
charging circuit 191 to be appropriate for various conditions on the basis of the detected result<br>
of the current monitor 192 for the electricity generation of the solar cell 193, which will be<br>
described later in detail.<br>
[0050] Various embodiments described herein may be implemented in a computer-<br>
readable medium using, for example, software, hardware, or some combination thereof. For a<br>
hardware implementation, the embodiments described herein may be implemented within one<br>
or more Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Digital Signal Processors (DSPs),<br>
Digital Signal Processing Devices (DSPDs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), Field<br>
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers,<br>
microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a<br>
selective combination thereof. In some cases, such embodiments are implemented by the<br>
controller 180.<br>
[0051] For software implementation, the embodiments such as procedures and<br>
functions may be implemented together with separate software modules each of which<br>
performs at least one of functions and operations. The software codes can be implemented with<br>
a software application written in any suitable programming language. Also, the software codes<br>
may be stored in the memory 160 and executed by the controller 180. As such, the mobile<br>
terminal has been described from the perspective of components for each function. Hereinafter,<br>
description will be given in more detail of the mobile terminal according to the present<br>
invention from the perspective of components depending on an outer appearance of the mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
[0052] FIG. 2 is a front perspective view of the mobile terminal according to one<br>
embodiment. The mobile terminal 100 disclosed is provided with a bar type terminal body. A<br>
case (casing, housing, cover, etc.) forming an outer appearance of a terminal body. In this<br>
embodiment, the case may include a front case 101 and a rear case 102. A space formed by the<br>
front case 101 and the rear case 102 may accommodate various components therein. At least<br><br>
one intermediate case may further be disposed between the front case 101 and the rear case 102.<br>
Such cases may be formed by injection-molded synthetic resin, or may be formed using a<br>
metallic material such as stainless steel (STS) or titanium (Ti).<br>
[0053] The terminal body is shown, on a front surface, having a display unit 151, an<br>
audio output module 152, a first image input unit 121, an illumination sensor 141 and the like.<br>
The display 151 denotes a device for visually displaying information. Example of the display<br>
151 may include a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), an e-<br>
paper and the like. The display 151 may further include a touch sensitive portion so as to allow<br>
information to be input by a user's touch. Hence, if a touch input is detected on a position on<br>
the display 151, a content(s) corresponding to the touched position is input.<br>
[0054] The contents input in the touch-sensitive manner may include characters (letters)<br>
or numerals, indications in various modes or definable menu items. The touch sensitive portion<br>
may be transparent so that the display 151 is visible and have a structure for enhancing<br>
visibility of a touch screen at a bright place. In FIG. 2, the display 151 occupies most of a front<br>
surface of the front case 102. The first audio output module 152 may serve as a receiver to<br>
output call related sounds to users. Alternatively, the first audio output module 152 may act as a<br>
loud speaker for outputting various alarm sounds of systems or multimedia reproduction<br>
sounds.<br>
[0055] The illumination sensor 141 may detect ambient brightness around the mobile<br>
terminal for visibility of the display 151. Also, the illumination sensor 141 may detect<br>
brightness for determining whether to operate the charging circuit 191 in order to activate the<br>
solar cell 193, as provided in further detail below. The terminal body is shown, on a side<br>
surface, having side keys 132, an interface unit 170 and an audio input unit 122. The side keys<br>
132 may be referred to as a manipulation unit, and receive commands for controlling<br>
operations of the mobile terminal 100. The side keys 132 may be operated by a user in any<br>
tactile manner. Contents input via the side keys 132 may variously be set. For instance, the side<br>
keys 132 may be configured to receive commands, such as control of the image input unit 121,<br>
adjusting audio sound output via the audio output modules 152 and 152', conversion of the<br>
display 151 into a touch recognition mode or the like.<br><br>
[0056] The audio input unit 122 may be implemented, for example, as a type of a<br>
microphone, for receiving user's voice, other sounds and the like. The interface unit 170 may<br>
serve to interface the mobile terminal 100 according to the present invention with external<br>
devices for data exchange therebetween. For example, examples of the interface unit 170 may<br>
include at least one of a connection terminal to be connected to an earphone by wire or<br>
wirelessly or a power supply terminals for supplying power to ports for short-range<br>
communications (e.g., an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) port, a BLUETOOTH port, a<br>
wireless LAN port and so on). Alternatively, the interface unit 170 may be configured as a card<br>
socket for accommodating a Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card, a User Identity<br>
Module (UIM) card, or an external card such as a memory card for storing information.<br>
[0057] FIG. 3 is a rear perspective view of the mobile terminal of FIG 2. As shown in<br>
FIG. 3, a rear surface of the terminal body may further be provided with a second image input<br>
unit 121'. The second image input unit 121' faces a direction which is opposite to a direction<br>
faced by the first image input unit 121 located on the front surface of the terminal body, and<br>
may be a camera having different pixels from those of the first image input unit 121.<br>
[0058] For example, the first image input unit 121 may operate with relatively lower<br>
pixels (lower resolution). Thus, the first image input unit 121 may be useful when a user can<br>
capture his face and send it to another party during a video call or the like. On the other hand,<br>
the second image input unit 121' may operate with a relatively higher pixels (higher resolution)<br>
such that it can be useful for a user to obtain higher quality pictures for later use. Such first and<br>
second image input units 121 and 121' may be installed in the terminal body to be rotatable or<br>
popped up.<br>
[0059] A flash 123 and a mirror 124 may additionally be disposed adjacent to the<br>
second image input unit 121'. The flash 123 operates in conjunction with the second image<br>
input unit 121' when taking a picture using the second image input unit 121'. The mirror 124<br>
can cooperate with the second image input unit 121' to allow a user to photograph himself in a<br>
self-portrait mode.<br>
[0060] A second audio output module 152' may further be disposed at a rear surface of<br>
the terminal body. The second audio output module 152' can cooperate with the first audio<br>
output module 152 to provide stereo output. Also, the second audio output module 152' may be<br><br>
configured to operate as a speakerphone. A battery 194 for supplying power to the mobile<br>
terminal 100 may be mounted to the rear surface of the terminal body. The battery 194 may be<br>
internally disposed at the terminal body, or be detachably disposed outside the terminal body.<br>
[0061] The solar cell 193 for generating electricity by using sunlight or illumination<br>
lamp may be mounted onto a rear surface of the terminal body or a rear surface of the battery<br>
194. The solar cell 193 may be configured by connecting a plurality of unit cells in series or in<br>
parallel, and also have a specific pattern.<br>
[0062] As such, the illumination sensor 141 according to the present invention may be<br>
installed at the front surface of the terminal body at which the display 151 is disposed, while<br>
the solar cell 193 may be installed at the rear surface of the terminal body. That is, the<br>
illumination sensor 141, as will be explained later, may be used to adjust brightness of the<br>
display 151, accordingly it is located at the position where the display 151 is disposed. In<br>
addition, the detected result of the illumination sensor 141 may be used to determine whether to<br>
operate (activate, activate) the charging circuit 191 upon the solar 193 generating electricity,<br>
whereby the employment of the illumination sensor 141 can result in the reduction of the<br>
number of components and enabling various functions. The battery 194 may also be<br>
configured to store electricity generated by the solar cell 193 or store power supplied from a<br>
home power source.<br>
[0063] Referring to FIG. 4, the charging method using the mobile terminal depends on<br>
the illumination results measured by the illumination sensor 141. The illumination sensor 141<br>
is allowed to detect ambient brightness (i.e., quantity of light) around the mobile terminal<br>
(S410). It is checked whether the brightness detected by the illumination sensor 141 is more<br>
than a reference value (S420). The reference value may be greater than or equal to brightness<br>
corresponding to minimum power needed to operate the charging circuit 191 for charging the<br>
battery 194. If the brightness detected by the illumination sensor 141 is more than the reference<br>
value, the charging circuit 191 for charging the battery 194 is activated (S440). On the other<br>
hand, if the brightness value detected by the illumination sensor 141 is smaller than the<br>
reference value, the latest (previously) detected value of the illumination sensor 141 is retrieved<br>
(selected) from the memory and the latest detected value is compared to the reference value<br>
(S430).<br><br>
[0064] The process in S430 is performed to determine whether brightness has<br>
drastically changed within a short time or whether the same brightness is intentionally retained<br>
for a long time. For instance, in some cases where the solar cell 193 temporarily faces away<br>
from the sun or a light source, or when the solar cell 193 is temporarily obscured from the sun<br>
by the palm or other objects, or the like, the charging circuit 191 is kept activated. This case<br>
corresponds to the latest detected value being greater than the reference value. In contrast, if<br>
the latest detected value of the illumination sensor 141 is also smaller than the reference value,<br>
the charging circuit 191 is not activated but the detected result of the illumination sensor is kept<br>
monitored.<br>
[0065] Even when the result detected by the illumination sensor 141 is more than the<br>
reference value, if the quantity of electricity generated by the solar cell 193 is insignificant, the<br>
current monitor 192 is allowed to check whether a charged (generated) current of the solar cell<br>
193 is larger than a reference value, so as to block (restrict) an unnecessary operation of the<br>
charging circuit 191. Here, the reference value compared to the generated current may be set to<br>
be larger than or equal to a current corresponding to the minimum power needed for effectively<br>
charging the battery.<br>
[0066] If the current generated by the solar cell 193 is smaller than the reference value<br>
(S450), the operation of the charging circuit 191 is restricted (S470), and if the current<br>
generated by the solar cell 193 is larger than the reference value, the charging circuit 191 is<br>
kept operated so as to charge the battery 194 (S460). Accordingly, when the electricity (power)<br>
generated by the solar cell 193 is greater than the consumed power of the charging circuit 191,<br>
the charging circuit 191 is activated, thereby preventing discharging of the battery 194 in spite<br>
of the solar cell 193 generating electricity.<br>
[0067] FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a charging method of a mobile terminal in<br>
accordance with another embodiment. According to one embodiment, a process is performed to<br>
compare the detected result of the illumination sensor 141 with two reference values,<br>
respectively. In a state where the display 151 is on and the illumination sensor 141 is initiated<br>
(S511), comparison is performed to check whether brightness detected by the illumination<br>
sensor 141 is greater than a first reference value (S521). The first reference value denotes a<br><br>
reference value for adjusting brightness of the display 151. If the detected brightness is less<br>
than the first reference value, the brightness of the display 151 is adjusted (S522).<br>
[0068] Otherwise, another comparison is performed to check whether the brightness<br>
detected by the illumination sensor 141 is greater than a second reference value (S523), if so,<br>
power is supplied to the charging circuit 191 (S540). If the detected brightness value is smaller<br>
than the second reference value, the latest detected value of the illumination sensor 141 is<br>
compared to the second reference value. If the latest detected value by the illumination sensor<br>
is greater than the second reference value, then power is supplied to charging circuit 191 (S530,<br>
S540). If the current of the solar cell is greater than a predetermined value, then the battery is<br>
charged, else the charging circuit is deactivated (S550, S560, S570). In this example, the<br>
second reference value denotes a value greater than or equal to power needed to effectively<br>
charge the battery. Thus, the second reference value is independent of the first reference value.<br>
Accordingly, the illumination sensor 141 is used to execute two functions, namely, adjusting<br>
the brightness of the display 151 and determining whether to activate the charging circuit 191.<br>
[0069] FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing a charging method of a mobile terminal in<br>
accordance with another embodiment. In this embodiment, after comparing the latest detected<br>
value of the illumination sensor 141 to a reference value, if the latest detected value of the<br>
illumination sensor 141 is greater than the reference value, this state is regarded as a temporary<br>
block from sunlight, whereby a function stored for electricity generation of the solar cell 193 is<br>
executed or a user interface is provided.<br>
[0070] That is, it is determined whether the brightness value detected by the<br>
illumination sensor 141 is greater than the reference value (S620). If the detected value is<br>
greater than the reference value, the latest detected value of the illumination sensor 141 is then<br>
compared to the reference value (S630). If the latest detected value of the illumination sensor<br>
141 is greater than the reference value, whether there is a function stored to be executed in this<br>
state is determined (S631). For instance, the function stored to be executed in this state may<br>
correspond to visually displaying of an indication or audibly outputting of an indication sound<br>
so as to render a user lay the mobile terminal such that the solar cell 193 faces a correct<br>
direction.<br><br>
[0071] In this example, if the illumination sensor 141 and the solar cell 193 normally<br>
operate, the user may be informed of whether to activate the charging circuit 191 and alerted to<br>
reposition the mobile terminal toward the ambient light (if the light is being blocked), thereby<br>
rendering the charging of the battery possible.<br>
[0072] FIG. 7 is a flowchart showing a charging method of a mobile terminal in<br>
accordance with another embodiment. In this embodiment, the brightness of the ambient light<br>
is detected by the illumination sensor (S710) and when the ambient brightness value of the<br>
mobile terminal is greater than a reference value (S720), if a current of the solar cell 193<br>
measured by the current monitor 192 is smaller than a reference value, it is considered as the<br>
solar cell 193 being temporarily blocked from sunlight, and accordingly a function stored for<br>
electricity generation of the solar cell 193 is executed or a user interface is provided to alert the<br>
user that the ambient light is being blocked. If the latest detected value of illumination is<br>
greater than a reference value (S730), then the system moves to S750 as provided in further<br>
detail below.<br>
[0073] In a state where power is supplied to the charging circuit 191 (S740), it is<br>
determined whether a current of the solar cell 193 is larger than a reference value (S750). If<br>
the current is smaller than the reference value, it is determined whether there is a function<br>
stored to be executed (S751), otherwise the battery is charged (S760). If a function is to be<br>
executed, the stored function is executed and the charging circuit is powered off (S752),<br>
otherwise the charging circuit is powered off (S770). The function stored to be executed may,<br>
for example, correspond to visually displaying an indication or audibly outputting an indication<br>
sound to notify a user to position the mobile terminal such that the solar cell 193 faces a correct<br>
direction. Hence, the different consequences resulted from different installation positions of the<br>
illumination sensors 141 and the solar cell 193 can be correctly rectified.<br>
[0074] FIG. 8 shows another embodiment of a mobile terminal. FIG. 8 shows a front<br>
surface of the mobile terminal in a closed state. FIG 9 shows a rear surface of the mobile<br>
terminal in a closed state, and FIG. 10 shows a front surface of the mobile terminal in an open<br>
state. As shown in FIGS. 8 to 10, a mobile terminal 200 may comprise a main body part 202<br>
and a folder part 201 foldably coupled to the main body part 202 by hinge portions 206. An<br>
outer surface of the folder part 201 is shown having a first display 251. A second display 251'<br><br>
may be installed at a folded inner surface of the folder part 201. As shown in FIG 10, an<br>
illumination sensor 241 may be provided at one side of the second display 251' for allowing<br>
adjustment of brightness of the second display 251' depending on an ambient brightness.<br>
[0075] A battery 294 for supplying power may be detachably mounted onto a rear<br>
surface of the main body part 202. A solar cell 293 may be mounted on the rear surface of the<br>
main body part 202 or a surface of the battery 294. As such, according to this embodiment, the<br>
ambient brightness of the illumination sensor 241 remarkably differs, respectively, in an<br>
unfolded state and a folded state of the folder part 201 having the illumination sensor 241.<br>
Hence, whether to activate a charging circuit may be determined in consideration of the<br>
configuration.<br>
[0076] FIG. 11 is a flowchart showing a charging method of the mobile terminal<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 10. According to this embodiment, it is determined whether the<br>
folder part 201 is in an unfolded state (SI 101). In the unfolded state of the folder part 201,<br>
whether to activate the charging circuit may be determined according to the method illustrated<br>
in FIG. 4 (e.g., processes S1110 to SI 170 correspond to the steps S410 to S470, respectively).<br>
For the purpose of brevity, a duplicative discussion of the above processes is not repeated here.<br>
[0077] However, in the folded state, the second display 251' and the illumination sensor<br>
241 are in a disable (unavailable) state, so a charging method is decided by using a previously<br>
(latest) detected value of the illumination sensor 241 and a currently charged (generated)<br>
current of the solar cell 293. That is, in the folded state of the folder part 201, the previously<br>
detected value of the illumination sensor 241 is compared to a reference value (S1102). If the<br>
previously detected value is greater than the reference value (SI 103) (e.g., in a case where the<br>
folder part 201 was unfolded previously and the ambient brightness was greater than a<br>
reference value), the solar cell 193 may be operated in spite of the folded state of the folder part<br>
201, resulting in activating the charging circuit and charging the battery (SI 160).<br>
[0078] After comparing the previous detected value of the illumination sensor 241 with<br>
the reference value, even when the previously detected value is smaller than the reference value,<br>
if the quantity of electricity generated by the solar cell 293 is sufficient, a current of the solar<br>
cell 293 is compared with a reference value in order to operate the charging circuit 291. If the<br>
current of the solar cell is larger than the reference value, the charging circuit 291 is activated<br><br>
and the battery 294 is charged. On the other hand, if the current of the solar cell is smaller<br>
than the reference value, the current of the solar cell 293 is periodically compared with the<br>
reference value a number of times (i.e., polling by use of a timer) (SI 104).<br>
[0079] A controller may control the operation of the charging circuit in cooperation<br>
with the illumination sensor depending on whether the phone is in an open or folded stated.<br>
In addition, in the folded or closed state of the folder part (i.e., in a non-operating state of the<br>
illumination sensor), the controller may control the charging circuit to be operated depending<br>
on the ambient brightness of the mobile terminal. Therefore, unnecessary discharging of<br>
electric energy can be prevented.<br>
[0080] As provided above, by employing the charging method of the mobile terminal,<br>
the illumination sensor is utilized to determine whether to operate the charging circuit of the<br>
battery according to an ambient brightness, thereby preventing discharging of the battery due to<br>
power consumed by the charging circuit exceeding the charged power in the battery under a<br>
weak brightness environment. The illumination sensor can cooperate with the current monitor<br>
of the solar cell to allow a smooth charging by use of the solar cell under more various<br>
conditions.<br>
[0081] The foregoing embodiments and advantages of the charging method of the<br>
mobile terminal having described are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting<br>
the present disclosure. The present teachings can be readily applied to other types of<br>
apparatuses. This description is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the<br>

value, the operation of the charging circuit is suspended.<br>
13. A mobile terminal comprising:<br>
a terminal main body;<br><br>
an illumination sensor mounted at a first surface of the terminal main body, the first<br>
surface provided with a display;<br>
a solar cell mounted at a second surface of the terminal main body; and<br>
a controller configured to control whether to operate a charging circuit for charging a<br>
battery based upon brightness detected by the illumination sensor and a generated current of the<br>
solar cell.<br>
14. The terminal of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured to operate the<br>
charging circuit for charging the battery if the brightness detected by the illumination sensor is<br>
more than a reference brightness.<br>
15. The terminal of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured to restrict the<br>
operation of the charging circuit if the generated current of the solar cell is less than reference<br>
current, when the brightness detected by the illumination sensor is more than reference<br>
brightness.<br>
16. The terminal of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured to compare the<br>
previously detected value of the illumination sensor with a reference brightness if the<br>
brightness detected by the illumination sensor is less than the reference brightness, wherein if<br>
the previously detected value of the illumination sensor is greater than the reference brightness,<br>
the controller supplies power to the charging circuit, and if the previously detected value of the<br>
illumination sensor is smaller than the reference brightness, the controller controls the<br>
illumination sensor to redetect brightness.<br>
17. The terminal of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured to generate an audio<br>
or visual signal, if the previously detected value of the illumination sensor is greater than<br>
reference brightness.<br>
18. The terminal of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured generate an audio or<br>
visual signal if the generated current of the solar cell is less than a reference current even when<br>
the brightness detected by the illumination sensor is more than a reference brightness.<br><br>
19. The terminal of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured to recheck the<br>
amount of the generated current a preset number of times if the currently generated current of<br>
the solar cell is smaller than a reference current, and thereafter if the rechecked generated<br>
current is smaller than the reference current, the controller is configured to restrict the<br>
operation of the charging circuit.<br>
20. A computer readable storage medium comprising executable logic code, wherein<br>
when the logic code is executed on a computer causes the computer to:<br>
detect brightness of ambient light around the mobile terminal by an illumination sensor<br>
of the mobile terminal;<br>
activate a charging circuit for charging a battery of the mobile terminal when the<br>
detected brightness is more than a first value;<br>
measure a generated current of a solar cell; and<br>
deactivate the charging circuit when the generated current of the solar cell is below a<br>
second value.<br><br><br>
A charging method of a mobile terminal is provided. The method comprises detecting<br>
brightness of ambient light around the mobile terminal by an illumination sensor of the mobile<br>
terminal; activating a charging circuit for charging a battery of the mobile terminal when the<br>
detected brightness is more than a first value; measuring a generated current of a solar cell; and<br>
deactivating the charging circuit when the generated current of the solar cell is below a second<br>
value.</td>
