PAINT SPRAY GUN<br>
The invention relates to a paint spray gun, more particularly to a paint spray gun that can improve efficiency of a paint spraying operation.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a conventional paint spray gun 1 is shown to include a gun body 11, an operating unit 12, and a spray cap 13.<br>
The gun body 11 has a handle portion 111, a head port ion<br>
112	connected to the handle portion 111, and a nozzle<br>
113	mounted on one end of the head portion 112 . The nozzle<br>
113 is formed with a nozzle orifice 114 . The head portion<br>
112 is formed with a material passageway 115 that is<br>
in fluid communication with the nozzle orifice 114 and<br>
that provides a path for flow of paint material from<br>
a paint canister (not shown) to the nozzle orifice 114.<br>
The nozzle 113 is further formed with a first air<br>
passageway 116 that is fluidly isolated from the nozzle<br>
orifice 114. The gun body 11 is further formed with a<br>
second air passageway 117 that extends from the handle<br>
portion 111 and along the head portion 112, that is in<br>
fluid communication with the first air passageway 116,<br>
and that provides a path for flow of pressurized air<br>
from a compressed air source (not shown) to the first<br>
air passageway 116.<br>
The operating unit 12 is mounted on the gun body 11, and includes a material flow controlling valve 121 for controlling the flow of the paint material through the<br><br>
2<br>
nozzle orifice 114, an air flow controlling valve 123 for controlling the flow of the pressurized air through the second air passageway 117, a trigger 122 coupled operably to and controlling opening and closing actions of the material flow controlling valve 121 and the air flow controlling valve 123, and an air flow regulator 124 for regulating air flow through the second air passageway 117.<br>
The spray cap 13 includes a cap body 131. The cap body 131 is disposed in front of the nozzle 113, and is formed with a central spray hole 132, two pairs of mist forming holes 133, and a pair of horn projections 134. The central spray hole 132 has a hole axis (z) extending in a longitudinal direction, and is registered and in fluid communication with the nozzle orifice 114 . The mist forming holes 133 in each pair are opposite to each other in a diametrical direction (r) relative to the hole axis (z) , and are disposed on opposite sides of the central spray hole 132 . The horn projections 134 extend from the cap body 131 in the longitudinal direction away from the nozzle 113, and are disposed adjacent to the mist forming holes 133. Each horn projection 134 is formed with a third air passageway 1340. The third air passageway 1340 terminates in an outlet opening 135 that is formed in a lateral side, which faces toward the central spray hole 132, of the corresponding horn projection 134. The mist forming<br><br>
3<br>
holes 133 and the third air passageways 1340 are in fluid communication with the first air passageway 116.<br>
When the trigger 122 of the operating unit 12 is operated to open the air flow controlling valve 123, pressurized air from the compressed air source (not shown) flows through the second air passageway 117, the first air passageway 116, and exits through the mist forming holes 133 and the outlet openings 135, thus creating a negative air pressure around the central spray hole 132. Since operation of the trigger 122 also results in opening of the material flow controlling valve 121, the paint material is drawn out of the paint canister (not shown) via the material passageway 115, and exits through the central spray hole 132, where it will be atomized by the pressurizedair stream that exits through the mist forming holes 133 and the outlet openings 135 such that the paint material can be sprayed on a target surface.<br>
However, due to the high velocity of the pressurized air stream, a portion of the atomized paint material is likely to bounce off the target surface, thereby polluting the work environment and resulting in wasted paint material.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, based on actual tests using the conventional paint spray gun l, when the air stream pressure at the vicinity of the central spray hole 132 ranges between27 to40psi, only35%to40%ofthe atomized<br><br>
4<br>
paint material adheres to the target surface to form an effective painted area (A). The remainder of the atomized paint material is either scattered to the ambient air, or spread on the target surface within a spread distance (D) from the effective painted area (A) to form an ineffective painted area (B).<br>
Referring to Figure 4, when the air stream pressure at the vicinity of the central spray hole 132 is reduced to below 10 psi, such as by operating the air flow regulator 124 or by using a high volume low pressure (HVLP) paint spray gun, up to 60% of the atomized paint material adheres to the target surface to form the effective painted area (A) , and the amount of the atomized paint material that scatters to the ambient air or that forms the ineffective painted area (B) is accordingly reduced. However, due to the reduction in the air stream pressure, the atomizing efficiency is lowered such that the painted area has a coarse surface and lacks luster.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a paint spray gun that can overcome the aforesaid drawbacks associated with the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, a paint spray gun of this invention comprises a gun body, an operating unit, and a spray cap.<br>
The gun body has a handle portion, a head portion connected to the handle portion, and a nozzle mounted<br><br>
5<br>
on the head portion. The nozzle is formed with a nozzle<br>
orifice. The gun body is formed with a material passageway that is in fluid communication with the nozzle orifice and that provides a path for flow of paint material to the nozzle orifice. The nozzle is further formed %ith a first air passageway that is fluidly isolated from the nozzle orifice. The gun body is further formed with a second air passageway that is in fluid communication with the first air passageway and that provides a path for flow of pressurized air from a compressed air source to the first air passageway.<br>
The operating unit is mounted on the gun body, and includes a material flow controlling valve for controlling the flow of the paint material through the nozzle orifice, an air flow controlling valve for controlling the flow of the pressurized air through the second air passageway, and a trigger coupled operably to and controlling opening and closing actions of the material flow controlling valve and the air flow controlling valve.<br>
The spray cap includes a cap body. The cap body is disposed in front of the nozzle, and is formed with a central spray hole, at least a pair of mist forming holes, a pair of horn projections, and at least a pair of mist controlling holes. The central spray hole has a hole axis extending in a longitudinal direction, and is registered and in fluid communication with the nozzle<br><br>
6<br>
orifice. The mist forming holes are opposite to each other in a first diametrical direction relative to the hole axis, and are disposed on opposite sides of the central spray hole. The horn projections extend from the cap body in the longitudinal direction away from the nozzle , and are disposed adj acent to the mist forming holes. Each of the horn projections has a root end that is connected to the cap body, a tip end that is opposite to the root end in the longitudinal direction, and a lateral side that extends between the root and tip ends and that faces toward the central spray hole. Each of the horn projections is formed with a third air passageway. The third air passageway terminates in at least a first outlet opening that is formed in the lateral side, and a second outlet opening that is formed in the tip end. The mist controlling holes are opposite to each other in a second diametrical direction relative to the hole axis, and are disposed on opposite sides of the central spray hole. The second diametrical direction forms an angle with the first diametrical direction. The mist forming holes, the third air passageways in the horn projections, and the mist controlling holes are in fluid communication with the first air passageway. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:<br><br>

Referring to Figures 5 and 6, the preferred embodiment of a paint spray gun according to the present invention is shown to include a gun body 2, an operating unit 3, and a spray cap 4.<br>
The gun body 2 has a handle portion 21, a head portion 22 connected to the handle portion 21, and a nozzle 23 mounted on the head portion 22 . The nozzle 23 is formed with a nozzle orifice 24 . The head portion 22 is formed with a material passageway 2 5  that  is  in fluid<br><br>
8<br>
communication with the nozzle orifice 24 and that provides a path for flow of paint material from a paint canister (not shown) to the nozzle orifice 24 . The nozzle 23 is further formed with a first air passageway 26 that is fluidly isolated from the nozzle orifice 24 . The gun body 2 is further formed with a second air passageway 27 that extends from the handle portion 21 and along the head portion 22 , that is in fluid communication with the first air passageway 26, and that provides a path for flow of pressurized air from a compressed air source (not shown) to the first air passageway 26.<br>
The operating unit 3 is mounted on the gun body 2, and includes a material flow controlling valve 31 for controlling the flow of the paint material through the nozzle orifice 24, an air flow controlling valve 33 for controlling the flow of the pressurized air through the second air passageway 27, a trigger 32 coupled operably to and controlling opening and closing actions of the material flow controlling valve 31 and the air flow controlling valve 33, and an air flow regulator 34 for regulating air flow through the second air passageway 27 .<br>
Since the feature of the present invention does not reside in the specific configurations of the gun body 2 and the operating unit 3, which are similar to those of the conventional paint spray gun, they will not described further herein for the sake of brevity.<br><br>
9<br>
The spray cap 4 includes a cap body 41. The cap body 41 is disposed in front of the nozzle 23 , and is formed with a central spray hole 42, at least a pair of mist forming holes 43, a pair of horn projections 44, and at least a pair of mist controlling holes 47 . The central spray hole 42 has a hole axis (z) extending in a longitudinal direction, and is registered and in fluid communication with the nozzle orifice 24, In this embodiment, there are two pairs of mist forming holes 43. The mist forming holes 43 in each pair are opposite to each other in a first diametrical direction (r1) relative to the hole axis (z), and are disposed on opposite sides of the central spray hole 42. The horn projections 44 extend from the cap body 41 in the longitudinal direction away from the nozzle 23, and are disposed adjacent to the mist forming holes 43. Each of the horn projections 44 has a root end 440 that is connected to the cap body 41, atipend442 that is opposite to the root end 440 in the longitudinal direction, and a lateral side 444 that extends between the root and tip ends 440 , 442 and that faces toward the central spray hole 42 . Each of the horn projections 44 is formed with a third air passageway 446. The third air passageway 44 6 terminates in at least a first outlet opening 4 5 that is formed in the lateral side 444, and a second outlet opening 46 that is formed in the tip end 442. In this embodiment, the lateral side 444 is formed with<br><br>
10<br>
a pair of the first outlet openings 45 . The mist controlling holes 47 are opposite to each other in a second diametrical direction (r2) relative to the hole axis (z), and are disposed on opposite sides of the central spray hole 42 . The second diametrical direction (r2) forms an angle with the first diametrical direction (r1) . In this embodiment, the second diametrical direction (r2) is transverse to the first diametrical direction (rl). The mist forming holes 43, the third air passageways 446 in the horn projections 44, and the mist controlling holes 47 are in fluid communication with the first air passageway 26 . The spray cap 4 further includes a locking collar 48 that surrounds and locks removably the cap body 41 on the head portion 22 of the gun body 2.<br>
When the trigger 3 2 of the operating unit 3 is operated to open the air flow controlling valve 33, pressurized air from the compressed air source {not shown) flows through the second air passageway 27, the first air passageway 26, and exits through the mist forming holes 43, the first and second outlet openings 45, 46, and the mist controlling holes 47 . Since a negative air pressure is created around the central spray hole 42, and since operation of the trigger 32 also results in opening of the material flow controlling valve 31, the paint material is drawn out of the paint canister (not shown) via the material passageway 25, and exits through<br><br>
11<br>
the central spray hole 42, where it will be atomized by the pressurized air stream that exits the nozzle 23 such that the paint material can be sprayed on a target surface.<br>
Referring to Figures 7 and 8, the pressurized air that flows through the second outlet openings 46 and the mist controlling holes 47 serves primarily to form an air barrier (H) around the atomized paint material. As a result, scattering of the atomized paint material to the ambient air can be reduced, thereby increasing the effective painted area (A). The pressurized air flowing through the second outlet openings 46 and the mist controlling holes 47 controls the width and length of the effective painted area (A) . As such, the ineffective painted area (B) within a spread distance (D) from the effective painted area (A) is reduced accordingly. In view of the aforesaid configuration, when the air stream pressure at the vicinity of the central spray hole 42 is increased to improve the atomizing efficiency, due to the corresponding increase in air pressure through the second outlet openings 46 and the mist controlling holes 47, a stronger air barrier (H) will be formed to minimize scattering of the atomized paint material. Therefore, pollution of the work environment and waste of the paint material can be reduced when the paint spray gun of this invention is in use.<br><br>
