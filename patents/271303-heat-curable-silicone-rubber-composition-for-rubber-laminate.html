				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HEAT-CURABLE SILICONE RUBBER COMPOSITION FOR RUBBER LAMINATE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a heat-curable silicone rubber composition for a<br>
rubber laminate composed of a silicone rubber layer and a rubber layer of a material other<br>
than silicone. Herein, the term "material other than silicone" covers organic synthetic rubber<br>
materials such as, e.g., fluororubber, acrylic rubber, nitrile rubber, and ethylene-propylene<br>
rubber.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Recent improvements in automobile efficiency and fuel-consumption led to<br>
increase of temperature in the automobile engine compartment. As a result such rubber<br>
materials as acrylo-nitrile-butadiene copolymers, hydrogenated acrylo-nitrile-butadiene<br>
copolymers, or similar acrylo-nitrile rubbers; acrylic rubbers, copolymers of ethylene and<br>
acrylic acid ester, copolymers of acrylic acid ester, ethylene, and vinyl acetate, or similar<br>
acrylic rubbers; EPM, EPDM, or similar ethylene-propylene rubbers, etc., which are<br>
conventionally used for manufacturing parts exposed to high temperatures of the engine<br>
compartment appeared to be insufficient in their resistance to heat. On the other hand, silicone<br>
rubbers have normally insufficient resistance to fuel oil and are highly permeable to gases,<br>
and therefore their use is limited, especially in areas where they can be exposed to fuel oils or<br>
fuel-oil-vapors.<br>
[0003] It was proposed to solve the above problem by forming a rubber laminate from<br>
silicone rubber and rubber other than silicone rubber. In particular, it was proposed to form a<br>
silicone laminate body by incorporating a fluororubber, which is characterized by excellent<br>
resistance to chemicals and fuel oils. However, since fluororubber has low surface energy and<br>
low reactivity, it is difficult to provide strong bonding between a fluororubber layer and a<br>
silicone-rubber layer. Therefore, several studies have been undertaken in order to solve the<br>
above problem.<br><br>
[0004] For example, a method was proposed for simultaneous cross-linking and curing a<br>
non-cross-linked silicone rubber and a non-cross-linked fluororubber while maintaining both<br>
rubbers in mutual contact (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Kokai") 2000-193152). Furthermore, Kokai 2003-19772 discloses<br>
a rubber laminate obtained by simultaneously vulcanizing a layer of fluororubber, which is<br>
mixed with a silica-type filler and contains vinylidene-fiuoride units, and a layer of silicone<br>
rubber, which contains a silica-type filler and a silane-coupling agent that contains amino<br>
groups. Kokai 2003-214565 discloses a rubber hose having an intermediate layer of a silicone<br>
rubber that contains an adhesive component and is placed between a fluororubber layer and a<br>
silicone-rubber layer. However, provision of the adhesive component in the silicone rubber<br>
impairs its heat-resistant properties and handling conditions and therefore limits application of<br>
the aforementioned laminates. Furthermore, exposure of the laminate to hot environment<br>
weakens bonding between the fluororubber layer and the silicone rubber.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0005] It is an object of the present invention to provide a heat-curable silicone rubber<br>
composition that makes it possible to obtain, in a rubber laminate composed of a silicone-<br>
rubber layer and a rubber layer other than a silicone rubber, such a silicone-rubber layer that<br>
preserves strong bonding to the aforementioned rubber layer other than the silicone-rubber<br>
layer, even after exposure to high temperatures.<br>
[0006] The heat-curable silicone rubber composition of the invention for a rubber<br>
laminate composed of a silicone-rubber layer and a rubber layer of a material other than<br>
silicone comprises:<br>
100 parts by mass of an alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (A) which comprises:<br>
50 to 99 mass % of an alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (Al) that is capped at<br>
molecular terminals with alkenyl-containing organosilyl groups, is free of alkenyl groups in<br>
side molecular chains, and has a degree of polymerization in the range of 2,500 to 100,000;<br>
1 to 50 mass % of an alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (A2) having two or<br>
more alkenyl groups in a side molecular chain and having a degree of polymerization in the<br>
range of 2,500 to 100,000;<br><br>
10 to 100 parts by mass of a fine silica powder (B) having specific surface area in the<br>
range of 50 m2/g to 400 m2/g;<br>
0.1 to 10 parts by mass of an organohydrogenpolysiloxane (C) having in one molecule at<br>
least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms; and<br>
0.1 to 5 part by mass of an organic peroxide (D).<br>
[0007] The rubber laminate of the present invention is obtained by simultaneously cross-<br>
linking and curing a heat-curable fluororubber composition and a heat-curable silicone<br>
composition, both compositions being in contact with each other during cross-linking;<br>
the aforementioned heat-curable silicone rubber composition comprising:<br>
100 parts by mass of an alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (A) that comprises:<br>
50 to 99 mass % of an alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (Al) that is capped at<br>
molecular terminals with alkenyl-containing organosilyl groups, is free of alkenyl groups in<br>
side molecular chains, and has a degree of polymerization in the range of 2,500 to 100,000;<br>
1 to 50 mass % of an alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (A2) having two or<br>
more alkenyl groups in a side molecular chain and having a degree of polymerization in the<br>
range of 2,500 to 100,000;<br>
10 to 100 parts by mass of a fine silica powder (B) having specific surface area in the<br>
range of 50 m2/g to 400 m2/g;<br>
0.1 to 10 parts by mass of an organohydrogenpolysiloxane (C) having in one molecule at<br>
least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms; and<br>
0.1 to 5 part by mass of an organic peroxide (D).<br>
[0008] The heat-curable silicone rubber composition of the invention is suitable for<br>
forming a rubber laminate composed of strongly bonded layers of a silicone-rubber and a<br>
rubber layer other than silicone, the laminate being formed by subjecting both layers to cross-<br>
linking and curing simultaneously while these layers are maintained in mutual contact. In<br>
particular, the composition is suitable for forming a rubber laminate that demonstrates good<br>
interlayer-bonding properties with respect to a hard-to-bond fluororubber layer. The<br>
aforementioned rubber laminate preserves strong bonding between the silicone-rubber layer<br>
and a layer of rubber other than silicone even after exposure to harsh high-temperature<br>
environment at temperatures exceeding 200°C. The method of the invention is efficient in that<br><br>
it allows manufacturing of the aforementioned rubber laminate with high efficiency and under<br>
industrial conditions.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0009] The alkenyl-containing diorganopolysiloxane (A) is one of the main components<br>
of the heat-curable silicone rubber composition of the invention. It comprises constituents<br>
(A1) and (A2) described below. The weight ratio of (Al): (A2) ranges from 50:50 to 99:1 and<br>
should preferably be in the range of 60:40 to 98:2. If constituent (Al) is used in an amount<br>
which is too small, or if constituent (A2) is used in excess, it will be difficult to provide<br>
sufficiently strong interlayer bonding in a rubber laminate obtained by simultaneously cross-<br>
linking and curing the silicone-rubber composition of the invention and a layer of rubber other<br>
than silicone rubber when both layers are maintained in mutual contact. If constituent (Al) is<br>
used in an excessive amount and the amount of constituent (A2) is too small, it will be<br>
difficult to provide strong interlayer bonding after exposure of the rubber laminate to the<br>
effect of a high-temperature environment.<br>
[0010] It is recommended to have component (A) with a linear molecular structure,<br>
however, within the limits that are not detrimental to resilient properties in the product<br>
obtained by cross-linking and curing the heat-curable silicone rubber of the invention,<br>
component (A) with a partially-branched molecular structure is also acceptable.<br>
[0011] Constituent (A 1) is an alkenyl group containing diorganopolysiloxane that is<br>
capped at molecular terminals with alkenyl-containing organosilyl groups, and is free of<br>
alkenyl groups in side molecular chains. This is an important constituent, which in<br>
combination with the below-described constituent (A2) and component (C), imparts strong<br>
bonding properties to a rubber laminate obtained by simultaneously cross-linking and curing<br>
the silicone-rubber composition of the invention and a layer of rubber other than silicon<br>
rubber, even after exposure to high temperature environment. Constituent (Al) may comprise<br>
a diorganopolysiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with alkenyldiorganosilyl groups.<br>
Constituent (Al) is a gum-like substance that has a degree of polymerization in the range of<br>
2,500 to 100,000, preferably in the range of 3,000 to 20,000. If necessary, constituent (Al)<br>
may comprise a combination of two or more appropriate diorganopolysiloxanes of the<br><br>
aforementioned type having different molecular structures and degrees of polymerization.<br>
Here, the degree of polymerization is a value determined from a polystyrene-referenced<br>
number-average molecular weight measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
[0012] Alkenyl groups of constituent (Al) may be exemplified by vinyl, allyl, butenyl, or<br>
hexenyl groups, of which vinyl groups are preferable from the cost viewpoint. Silicon-bonded<br>
groups other than alkenyl groups may be exemplified by non-substituted or substituted<br>
monovalent hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
Such groups may be represented by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, or similar alkyl groups;<br>
cyclohexyl, or similar cycloalkyl groups; phenyl, tolyl, or similar aryl groups, benzyl, β-<br>
phenylpropyl, or similar aralkyl groups; chloromethyl, trifluoropropyl, cyanoethyl, or similar<br>
groups of the aforementioned type wherein a part or all carbon-bonded hydrogen atoms are<br>
substituted with halogen atoms or cyano groups. Most preferable of the above groups are<br>
alkyl, in particular methyl groups, especially if more than 50 mole %, preferably more than 80<br>
mole %, and most preferably more than 95 mole % of silicon-bonded groups are methyl<br>
groups.<br>
[0013] Constituent (A2) is a diorganopolysiloxane having at least two alkenyl groups in<br>
side molecular chains. Constituent (A2) is an important constituent, which in combination<br>
with constituent (Al) imparts excellent interlayer bonding properties to a rubber laminate<br>
produced by simultaneously cross-linking and curing the heat-curable silicone rubber<br>
composition and a rubber composition other than the silicone-rubber composition, when<br>
during cross-linking the aforementioned compositions are maintained in mutual contact.<br>
Constituent (A2) is a gum-like substance that has a degree of polymerization in the range of<br>
2,500 to 100,000, preferably in the range of 3,000 to 20,000. Similar to the previous case, here<br>
the degree of polymerization is a value determined from a polystyrene-referenced number-<br>
average molecular weight measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
[0014] Alkenyl groups present in constituent (A2) may be exemplified by the same<br>
appropriate groups that were mentioned above, of which vinyl groups are preferable. From the<br>
viewpoint of improved balance between the interlayer bonding properties with the<br>
aforementioned rubber layer other than the silicone layer and mechanical strength of the<br><br>
cross-linked body obtained by cross-linking and curing the aforementioned heat-curable<br>
silicone rubber composition of the invention, it is recommended that constituent (A2) contain<br>
alkenyl groups in the amount of 0.4 to 1.8 mass %. In addition to side molecular chains, the<br>
alkenyl groups may also exist on molecular terminals. Furthermore, in addition to the alkenyl<br>
groups, this constituent may contain other silicon-bonded groups which are the same as<br>
corresponding groups mentioned above, of which preferable are alkyl groups, in particular<br>
methyl groups. It is recommended that more than 50 mole %, preferably more than 80<br>
mole %, and most preferably more than 95 mole % of silicon-bonded groups be methyl<br>
groups. Constituent (A2) may comprise a combination of two or more of the aforementioned<br>
diorganopolysiloxanes that have different molecular structures, degrees of polymerization,<br>
contents of alkenyl groups, etc.<br>
[0015] The fine silica powder that constitutes component (B) used in the heat-curable<br>
silicone rubber composition of the present invention is used for imparting excellent<br>
mechanical strength to the cured body obtained by cross-linking and curing the heat-curable<br>
silicone rubber composition of the invention. The aforementioned fine silica powder may be<br>
represented by fumed silica powder or a similar dry-process silica; precipitated silica, or a<br>
similar wet-process silica; or the aforementioned silicas subjected to hydrophobic surface<br>
treatment with organosilane, hexaorganodisilazane, diorganopolysiloxane,<br>
diorganocyclopolysiloxane, or similar organosilicon compounds. The fine silica powder<br>
should have a diameter of particles equal to or less than 50 µm. Furthermore, its specific<br>
surface area should be in the range of 50 m2/g to 400 m2/g, preferably in the range of 100<br>
m2/g to 400 m2/g, Component (B) should be used in an amount of 10 to 100 parts by mass per<br>
100 parts by mass of component (A). If component (B) is used in an amount less than 10 parts<br>
by mass, a body obtained after curing the heat-curable silicone rubber composition of the<br>
invention will have insufficient mechanical strength. If, on the other hand, the content of<br>
component (B) exceeds 100 parts by mass, this will impair compounding thereof with<br>
component (A).<br>
[0016] The organohydrogenpolysiloxane that constitutes component (C) contains in one<br>
molecule at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms. This is an important component that<br>
imparts strong interlayer bonding properties to a rubber laminate obtained by simultaneously<br><br>
cross-linking and curing the silicone-rubber composition of the invention and a layer of<br>
rubber other than silicon rubber. Silicon-bonded groups other than hydrogen atoms can be<br>
exemplified by the same other groups as those mentioned with regard to constituent (Al),<br>
preferable of which are alkyl groups, especially methyl groups. The<br>
organohydrogenpolysiloxane of component (C) may have a linear, partially branched, net-<br>
like, cyclic, or a three-dimensional molecular structure. This component may comprise a<br>
single polymer, or a mixture of two or more polymers. There are no special restrictions with<br>
regard to viscosity of organohydrogenpolysiloxane (C) at 25°C, but normally this component<br>
has a viscosity ranging from 0.5 to 50,000 mPa-s, preferably from 1 to 10,000 mPa-s.<br>
Component (C) is used in the amount of 0.1 to 10 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of<br>
component (A). If organohydrogenpolysiloxane (C) is used in the amount less than the<br>
recommended lower limit, the bonding force between the layers in the rubber laminate<br>
obtained by simultaneously cross-linking and curing the silicone-rubber composition of the<br>
invention and a layer of rubber other than silicone rubber when both layers are maintained in<br>
mutual contact will be insufficient. If, on the other hand, the content of component (C)<br>
exceeds the recommended upper limit, this will impair either workability of the heat-curable<br>
silicone rubber composition of the invention or physical properties of a cured body obtained<br>
by cross-linking and curing the composition.<br>
[0017] The organic peroxide that constitutes component (D) is used for cross-linking and<br>
curing the heat-curable silicone rubber composition of the invention. This component may<br>
comprise a conventional compound used for the same purpose. Specific examples of such<br>
compounds are the following: benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl per-benzoate, orthomethyl<br>
benzoyl peroxide, paramethyl benozoyl peroxide, 1,1-bis (tertiary-butylperoxy) 3,3,5-<br>
trimethyl cyclohexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di (tertiary-butyl-peroxy) hexane, or 2,5-dimethyl-<br>
2,5-di (tertiary-butyl peroxy) hexyne. These compounds are used individually or in<br>
combination of two or more. The organic peroxide of component (D) is used in the amount of<br>
0,1 to 5 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of component (A).<br>
[0018] Within the limits which do not contradict to the objects of the invention, the heat-<br>
curable silicone rubber composition of the invention may be combined with various agents,<br>
such as diatomaceous earth, quartz powder, calcium carbonate or similar extender; titanium<br><br>
oxide, carbon black, red oxide, or similar pigments; rare-earth type oxides, cerium lanolate,<br>
cerium fatty-acid salts, or similar heat-resistant agents; stearic acid, zinc stearate, calcium<br>
stearate, or similar fatty aids or their metal salts, or other mold-release agents.<br>
[0019] The aforementioned rubber material other than the silicone rubber used in the<br>
rubber laminate of the present invention is exemplified by fluororubber; acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene copolymer, hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, or a similar<br>
acrylonitrile rubber; acrylic rubber, a copolymer of ethylene and acrylic acid ester, a<br>
copolymer of vinyl acetate, ethylene, and acrylic acid ester; EPM, EPDM, or a similar<br>
ethylene-propylene type rubber. The fluororubber is preferable.<br>
[0020] There are no special restrictions with regard to the fluororubber suitable for use in<br>
the rubber laminate of the present invention. The polymers of the following compounds are<br>
examples of the aforementioned fluororubber: vinylidene fluoride (VdF),<br>
hexafluoropropylene (HFP), pentafluoropropylene, trifluoroethylene, trifluorochloroethylene<br>
(CTFE), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), vinylfluoride, perfluoro (methylvinylether), perfluoro<br>
(propylvinylidene), etc. Other examples may include compounds that can be used as a<br>
monomer copolymerizable with the aforementioned compounds, such as acrylic acid esters or<br>
similar vinyl compounds, propylene or similar olefin compounds or diene compounds, as well<br>
as halogenated vinyl compounds that contain chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or other<br>
copolymerized rubbers. Specific examples of such copolymers are the following: a<br>
copolymer of VdF and HFP, a copolymer of VdF and TFE, a copolymer of VdF and CTFE, a<br>
trimer of TFE, propylene, and VdF, a trimer of TFE, HFP, and VdF, a copolymer of HFP,<br>
ethylene, and VdF, a copolymer of fluoro (alkylvinylether) and olefin (e.g., a copolymer of<br>
VdF, TFE, and perfluoro (alkylvinylether)), or a copolymer of THF and propylene. Most<br>
preferable of the above compounds are the trimer of TFE, propylene, and VdF, the trimer of<br>
TFE, HFP, and VdF, and the copolymer of VdF and HFP.<br>
[0021] There are no special restrictions with regard to a method that can be used for<br>
cross-linking and curing the fluororubber, and appropriate conventional method can be used<br>
for this purpose. For example, this may be peroxide-based curing by mixing with an organic<br>
peroxide and, if necessary, with a bifunctional vinyl monomer, or a similar cross-linking-<br><br>
assisting agent; polyol-based curing by mixing with 2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane, or a<br>
similar polyol compound and, if necessary, with a quaternary ammonium salt, or a similar<br>
cross-linking assistant; polyamine curing based on the use of hexamethylene diamine<br>
carbamate; or polythiol curing based on the use of dimercaptodimethyl ether, or a similar<br>
sulfur-containing compound and, if necessary, of a quaternary ammonium salt or a similar<br>
cross-linking assistant. Most preferable from the viewpoint of imparting excellent heat-<br>
resistant properties are the peroxide-based curing method and the polyol-based curing<br>
method.<br>
[0022]	The fluororubber can be combined with other components such as a silica-type<br>
filler, a plasticizer such as a phthalic-acid derivative, adipic acid derivative, sebacic acid<br>
derivative, a softener such as lubricating oil, process oil, castor oil, antioxidants such as<br>
phenylene diamines, phosphates, quinolines, cresols, phenols, dithiocarbamate metal salts,<br>
etc.<br>
[0023] The rubber laminate of the present invention is produced by simultaneously<br>
heating and thus cross-linking and curing the heat-curable silicone composition of the present<br>
invention and a heat-curable rubber composition other than silicone composition, e.g., a<br>
fluororubber composition or the like which is compounded with a curing agent, both<br>
compositions being maintained in mutual contact during curing. There are no special<br>
restrictions with regard to the curing conditions but it may be recommended to conduct this<br>
process under a pressure in the range of 2 to 100 kg/cm2 and at a temperature ranging from<br>
100 to 200°C. Molding can be carried out by a compression-molding method; an injection-<br>
molding method; and extruding method which the heat-curable rubber composition of the<br>
invention and the rubber composition other than the silicone composition is continuously<br>
extruded with an extruder and the rubber laminate is cured, e.c. by steam heating. If<br>
necessary, after molding the product can be subjected to secondary vulcanization by heat-<br>
treating the obtained rubber laminate.<br>
[0024] There are no special restrictions with regard to the form of the rubber laminate of<br>
the invention. For example, this can be a two-layer laminate, a three-layer laminate, or a<br>
laminate having more than three layers, or a multiple-layer product having fiber-reinforces<br><br>
layers. Specific examples are the following: a rubber laminate having the inner layer made<br>
from a fluororubber or another rubber different from silicone rubber and the external layer<br>
made from the silicone rubber; a rubber laminate having .the inner layer made from a<br>
fluororubber or another rubber different from silicone rubber, an intermediate layermade<br>
from the silicone rubber, and the external layer made from a fluororubber or another rubber<br>
different from silicone rubber; or a rubber laminate having the inner layer made from a<br>
fluororubber or another rubber different from silicone rubber, an intermediate layer made<br>
from the silicone rubber, and the external layer made from a fiber-reinforced layer.<br>
[Practical Examples]<br>
[0025] The invention will be further described by way of practical and comparative<br>
examples, which, however, should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
[0026] [Preparation of Heat-curable silicone rubber composition]<br>
A kneader mixer was loaded with an organopolysiloxane, a dimethylpolysiloxane capped<br>
at both molecular terminals with hydroxyl groups, and silica in the proportions shown in<br>
Table 1. The components were mixed and kneaded for 30 min. at 30°C and then for 60 min. at<br>
170°C, whereby a silicone- rubber composition was produced. In proportions shown in Table<br>
1, the obtained composition was compounded with an organohydrogenpolysiloxane and<br>
dicumylperoxide, whereby a heat-curable silicone rubber composition was produced.<br>
[0027] [Preparation of Heat-curable Fluororubber Compositions 1, 2, and 3]<br>
100 parts by mass of DAI-EL G-902 (the product of Daikin Industries, Ltd.) were<br>
combined with 2.0 parts by mass of PERHEXA® 25B (2,5-dimethyl-2-di(t-butylperoxy)<br>
hexane (the product of NOF Co.), whereby heat-curable fluororubber composition 1 was<br>
produced. Furthermore, 100 parts by mass of Dyneon FLS-2650 (the product of 3M Co., Inc.)<br>
were combined with 2.0 parts by mass of PERHEXA® (2,5-dimethyl-2-di(t-butylperoxy)<br>
hexane (the product of NOF Co.), whereby heat-curable fluororubber composition 2 was<br>
produced. Similarly, 100 parts by mass of polyol-curable DAI-EL G-558 (compounded with<br>
Polyol) (the product of Daikin Industries, Ltd.) were compounded with 3 parts by mass of<br>
magnesium oxide and 6 parts by mass of calcium hydroxide, whereby heat-curable<br>
fluororubber composition 3 was produced.<br><br>
[0028] [Preparation of Rubber Laminate]<br>
A non-cross-linked sheet having a thickness of 0.5 mm was produced by kneading a<br>
heat-curable fluororubber composition in a two roll mill with heating at 60°C. A non-cross-<br>
linked sheet having a thickness of 3 mm was produced by kneading a heat-curable silicone<br>
rubber composition in a two roll mill with roll temperature of 30°C. Following this, the sheet<br>
of the non-cross-linked fluororubber sheet was wound onto an aluminum cylinder having a<br>
diameter of 150 mm. The sheet of the non-cross-linked silicone rubber was wound onto the<br>
first-mentioned sheet and then a cloth was wound on the sheet of the non-cross-linked silicone<br>
rubber to secure those rubber sheets to the cylinder, and then the unit was heated for 20 min.<br>
at 150°C in a steam autoclave. The unit treated in the above-described manner was removed<br>
from the autoclave, the cured body was disconnected from the cylinder and heated in an oven<br>
for 12 hours at 200°C, whereby a rubber laminate was produced.<br>
[0029] [Evaluation of Bonding Strength]<br>
The rubber laminate produced by the method described above was retained for 24 hours<br>
at room temperature and then was cut into 25 mm-wide ribbons which were used for<br>
evaluating initial bonding strength between the silicone-rubber layer and the fluororubber<br>
layer by a T-type peel method. Furthermore, the rubber laminate obtained by the<br>
aforementioned method was for the second time retained in an oven, but for 72 hours at<br>
220°C, and, after the above-mentioned ageing was completed, the laminate was evaluated<br>
with regard to the bonding strength by a T-type peel test. The bonding strength between the<br>
silicone-rubber layer and the fluororubber layer was evaluated as excellent when the peeling<br>
test showed high resistance to peeling and when cohesive failure was observed. The bonding<br>
strength was evaluate as low when peeling occurred without resistance with separation over<br>
the interface, and the test results were qualified as non-applicable (NA) when during the T-<br>
type peel test the silicone-rubber layer was ruptured.<br><br>
[0030] [Practical Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5]<br>
Properties of the rubber laminate produced by the above-described method from the<br>
heat-curable silicone rubber composition and the heat-curable fluoro-rubber composition were<br>
studied on the basis of bonding strength between the silicone and fluororubber layers prior to<br>
and after ageing. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
