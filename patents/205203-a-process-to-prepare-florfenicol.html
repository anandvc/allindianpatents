DESCRIPTION<br>
Florfenicol of Formula I, the fluoro derivative of thiamphenicol, is a broad spectrum antibiotic compound possessing activity against many Gram negative, Gram positive, and thiamphenicol-resistant microorganisms. Florfenicol, chemically known as (1R,25)-2-dichloroacetamido-3-fluoro-l-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-l-propanol, is of interest as a veterinary product.<br><br>
US Patent 4,235,892 describes a process to convert thiamphenicol into Florfenicol. The major drawback of this process was a poor fluorination step. The fluorination of N-protected compound, (1R,27R)-l-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2-phthalimido-l,3-propanediol, was accomplished with diethylamine sulfurtrifluoride (DAST), which was non-selective and led to a mixture of fluorinated products. The desired compound may thus be obtained at a sufficient purity by using complex column chromatography process. Also, it is hazardous and expensive to use DAST on a large scale.<br>
An alternate approach to prepare Florfenicol has been described in US Patent 4,876,352 starting from (4R,5R)-4-hydroxymethyl-5-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2-phenyl-2-oxazoline of   Formula III.     This   oxazoline  has   been   prepared  by   simultaneously   protecting<br><br>
the secondary hydroxyl group and the primary amino group present in (17?,27?)-2-amino-l-[(4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-l,3-propanediol of Formula IV as described in US Patent 5,227,494.<br><br>
This preparation requires use of toxic benzonitrile and harsh reaction conditions like 18 hours heating at 115°C. Alternatively, the desired oxazoline has been prepared in the US Patent 4,743,700 using ethyl benzimidate hydrochloride. However, the yield obtained is low, the remainder being isomeric oxazoline of Formula V<br><br><br>
Thereafter, this oxazoline has been conveniently converted to the corresponding fluoro oxazoline of Formula VI by reacting with Ishikawa reagent,<br><br>
(1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl)diethylamine. After performance of fluorination step, the oxazoline   is   hydrolyzed  to obtain amine  of Formula VII. This removal   of oxazoline<br><br>
protecting group necessitates heating at 100°C for 18 hours with 12N hydrochloric acid that results in significant amount of by-product, 1,3-propanediol of Formula IV.<br>
In view of the prior art described above, the present invention provides a new process for preparing highly pure Florfenicol starting from (1R,2R)-2-amino-l-[(4-methylsulfonyl) phenyl]-l,3-propanediol of Formula IV. In this process, the hydrogen atom of the secondary hydroxyl group and the one hydrogen atom of the primary amino group have been contemporaneously protected by acetonide formation and the second hydrogen atom of the primary amine has been derivatized with an acetyl group. This results in preparation of oxazolidine derivative, namely (4R,5R)-3-acetyl-2,2-dimethyl-4-hydroxymethyl-5-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidine of Formula II.<br><br>
The present invention is directed towards a new process for preparing Florfenicol antibiotic. According to the present invention, a process is described to prepare a novel oxazolidine compound of Formula II that starts from (lR,2R)-2-amino-l-[(4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-l,3-propanediol hydrochloride of Formula VIII.   The starting material of Formula VIII may be<br><br>
obtained from the commercially available thiamphenicol as described in the US Patent 4,235,892.<br><br>
According to the instant invention, amino diol compound of Formula VIII is treated with an agent which can afford oxazolidine compound of Formula IX.    It  is  preferred  to use<br><br>
acetone, 2-methoxypropene or 2,2-dimethoxypropane in presence of an organic base and a solvent wherein the said solvent is acetone, toluene, xylenes, hexanes or a mixture thereof. Preferably the base is an alkylamine and more specifically it is triethylamine. The most preferred technique to prepare oxazolidine compound of Formula IX is to heat aminodiol compound of Formula VIII with eight to ten times by volume of acetone which can react to produce oxazolidine, as cited above, and which may also act as solvent. The reaction is carried out at 50°C to 60°C in presence of 1.2 to 2.0 mole of triethylamine. This preparation has the advantage of being regio-selective, involves relatively mild reaction conditions and no racemization of the chiral starting material occurs. Subsequent to this reaction, N-acetylation in methylene chloride is performed with acetyl chloride and triethylamine base to obtain oxazolidine compound of Formula II in good yield.<br>
Thereafter, the hydroxy compound of Formula II is converted to the corresponding fluoro derivative, (4S,5R)-3-acetyl-2,2-dimethyl-4-fluoromethyl-5-[4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidine, of    Formula X, wherein the   carbinol    compound    is    reacted<br><br>
with (1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl)diethylamine fluorinating agent in an inert organic solvent under pressure conditions at elevated temperatures. The reaction is conducted in a closed system at 80°C to 110°C under pressure ranging from 60 psi to 100 psi. The suitable organic solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene and the like. The most preferred solvent is methylene chloride. The amount of fluorinating agent is preferably in excess over that required by stoichiometry. The molar ratio of (1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl)diethylamine to the hydroxy compound is 1:1 to 3:1 and preferably 2:1.<br>
It may be noted here that absolute configuration of the two compounds of Formula II and Formula X is analogous while the apparent difference in the configuration of the atom at position 4 is due exclusively to rules of nomenclature.<br>
After performance of fluorination step, the protective groups are removed from the compound of Formula X to obtain amine of Formula VII. The preferred method consists in removing the protecting   groups   with   acids,   preferably   inorganic    acids,    in   aqueous   medium.<br><br>
fluoro oxazondrine of formula X is advantageously hydrolyzed by heating with 6N aqueous hydrochloric acid at 90-100°C for 30 min.<br>
Finally, the compound of Formula VII is acylated with dichloroacetic acid or with a reactive derivative thereof to prepare Florfenicol by the methods reported in art.<br>
Preparation of novel oxazolidine compound of Formula II and its conversion to fluoro amine of Formula VII are the inventive steps of this Florfenicol synthesis. The major advantage realized in the present synthesis as compared to the prior art is the rapid hydrolysis of oxazolidine resulting in greater efficiency and higher product purity.<br>
The new Florfenicol synthesis is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
