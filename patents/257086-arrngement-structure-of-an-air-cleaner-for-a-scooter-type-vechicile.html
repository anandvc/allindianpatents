COMPLETE SPECIFICATION    [See Section 10, rule 13]<br>
"ARRANGEMENT STRUCTURE OF AN AIR CLEANER FOR A SCOOTER TYPE  VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA    MOTOR    CO.,    LTD.,    a    corporation    of    Japan,    of    1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
This invention relates to an arrangement structure of an air cleaner for a scooter type vehicle. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
In a conventional arrangement structure'of an air cleaner, an engine is provided sidewardly of a rear wheel of a scooter type vehicle, and the air cleaner is disposed above the sidewardly provided engine (refer to, for example, patent document 1).<br>
Meanwhile, in some scooter type vehicle wherein an engine is disposed between the front wheel and the rear<br><br><br>
                        2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wheel, an air cleaner is positioned forwardly of the rear wheel above the engine (refer .to, for example, patent document 2).<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent document 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 1-25119<br>
{page 2, FIG. 3)<br>
[Patent document 2]<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 3-71317 (pages 3-4, FIG. 1) [0004]<br>
The patent documents 1 and 2 mentioned above are described in detail below the reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 13 is a schematic view of a conventional supporting vehicle body for a motorcycle (copy of FIG. 3 of the patent document 1).<br>
In the conventional supporting vehicle body for a motorcycle, a two-cycle engine is used and an engine/transmission assembly 13 is disposed on the left side of a rear driving wheel 17 while an air cleaner not shown in FIG. 13 is disposed at an upper portion in the inside (within a contour line) of the engine/transmission assembly 13.  Further, a silencer 19 is accommodated in a cavity formed forwardly of the rear driving wheel 17.<br>
3<br><br>
[0005]<br>
FIG. 14 is a schematic view of a conventional<br>
motorcycle of the scooter type having a two-cycle engine {copy of FIG. 1 of the patent document 2).<br>
In the conventional scooter type motorcycle, a carburetor 32 and an air cleaner 34 are disposed forwardly of a rear wheel 24 above a.n engine 20, and the air cleaner 34 is connected to the Qarburetor 32 by a joint 33.  Consequently, the intake pipe length is comparatively short. [0006] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The supporting vehicle body for a motorcycle described above with reference to FIG. 13 is structured such that the air cleaner is provided at an upper portion of the engine/transmission assembly 13 for which a two-cycle engine is used, and where a four-cycle engine is used, it is necessary to secure a predetermined volume for the intake pipe in order to improve the intake efficiency.  To this end, a predetermined length is required.  For example, where the length of the intake pipe for a four-cycle engine is set t:o a predetermined length, there is the possibility that the intake pipe may interfere with a cowl 11, and the degree of freedom when<br>
4<br><br>
a length of the intake pipe is to be set cannot be raised readily. [0007]<br>
The scooter type motorcycle described above with reference to FIG. 14 uses the joint 33 for the connection between the carburetor  32 and the air cleaner 34.  However, since the joint 33 has a channel-shape and is bent in an L-shape, the intake air resistance of the joint 33 is high.<br>
Further, the intake pipe is connected to the front side of the air cleaner 34.  Therefore, it is cumbersome, because the front side of the air cleaner 3 4 cannot be removed upon maintenance of the air cleaner 34. [0008]<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an arrangement structure of an air cleaner for a scooter type vehicle wherein a connecting tube for connecting the air cleaner to a carburetor can be set to a desired curve and length to achieve reduction of the intake air resistance and raise the intake efficiency of an intake system.  Further, the air cleaner is accommodated compactly in a vehicle body cover and is easy in maintenance. [0009]<br>

[0040]<br>
FIG. 11 is a sectional view taken along line 11-11 of FIG. 1 and shows a configuration for attachment and removal of a central portion of the body cover unit 28,<br>
As described hereinabove, a central portion of the<br><br>
                     23<br><br>
body cover unit 28 has an attachment configuration wherein the luggage box 22 and the rear cover 141 are combined integrally by means of the stud bolts .157, 157 welded to the lugs 155, 155 of the rear grip 26, and the three parts are secured to the brackets 84, 84 of the upper first cross member 81 of the vehicle body frame 11 by means of the opening/closing volts 158, 158.  On the other hand, upon removal, the opening/closing volts 158, 158 and the bolt 22a (refer to FIG. 8) at a front lower portion of the luggage box 22 are removed {with the seat 2 3 opened).  Consequently, the parts can be pivoted in an integrated state, that is, in the form of the body cover unit 28. [0041]<br>
FIG. 12 is a view illustrating opening/closing of the vehicle body cover, which covers the arrangement structure of an air cleaner according to the present invention.  The body cover unit 28 covers the upper side of the engine 31 below the seat 23 and is pivoted upwardly and downwardly (in the directions indicated by arrow marks © and ©) around the hinge 27 provided on the rear side of the vehicle body frame 11. [0042]<br>
. Now, an outline of opening and closing of the body<br><br>
                      24<br><br>
cover unit 28 is described briefly.<br>
First, the seat 23 is opened, and the bolt 22a (refer to FIG. 8) for securing the bottom of the luggage box 22 to the vehicle body frame 11 and the opening/closing volts 158, 158 for securing a central portion of the body cover unit 28 are removed, whereafter the seat 23 is closed.  Then, the r$ar cover 141 is opened as indicated by an arrow mark ©.  in other words, the body cover unit 28 is pivoted upwardly (in the direction indicated by the arrow mark ©) . [0043]<br>
Operation of the arrangement structure of an air cleaner for a scooter type vehicle described above is described below.<br>
The crankshaft 62   of the engine 31 is disposed sidewardly of the rear wheel 17 and the carburetor 35 is disposed above the engine 31 while the air cleaner 3 6 is disposed above the rear wheel 17 siclewardly of the carburetor 35.  Therefore, when the power unit 16 wherein the engine 31, transmission 126, ancl drive shaft (rear wheel supporting shaft) 63 are integrated with one another as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 are attached, the center 162 of the air exit 58 of the air cleaner 36 substantially coincides with the center axial line 161 of<br>
25<br><br>
the carburetor 35 in its heightwise direction (direction indicated by an  arrow mark 7).  Further, the intake pipe extends from the engine 31 to the air cleaner 36  past the carburetor 35 without being bent, and consequently, the length of the intake pipe can be increased to expand the volume of the intake pipe thereby to improve the intake efficiency. [0044]<br>
Further, where the connecting tube 91 is formed in an L-shape, the intake air resistance can be suppressed. [0045]<br>
Further, since the air cleaner 3 6 includes the front side case 46 and the rear side case 4 7 and the carburetor 3 5 is connected to the rear side case 4 7 by the L-shaped connecting tube 91, the connecting tube 91 is simplified in shape and can be accommodated compactly in the body cover unit (vehicle body cover) 28. [0046]<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, the body cover unit 28, which covers the upper side of the engine 31 below the seat 23, is pivoted upwardly and downwardly around the hinge 27 provided on   the rear side of the vehicle body, more particularly, on the rear side of the vehicle body frame 11.  Therefore, even where the arrangement structure<br><br><br>
                              26<br><br><br>
(refer to FIGS. 1 and 2) of the air cleaner 36 is adopted, a space can be assured around the air cleaner 36, and no<br>
much time is required for inspection of the air cleaner<br>
36 (refer to FIG. 4). [0047]<br>
Further, since the body cover unit 28, which covers the upper side of the engine 31 below the seat .23, is pivoted upwardly and downwardly around the hinge 2 7 provided on   the rear side of the vehicle body frame 11, even where the crankshaft 62 of the engine 31 is disposed sidewardly of the rear wheel 17 and the carburetor 35 is disposed above the engine 31, a great space can be assured around the engine 31. [0048]<br>
With regard to the air cleaner 36, the first securing portion 54 is formed at a lower portion of the case body 53 of the rear side case 47, and the rear fender 55 is provided such that it extends downwardly from a lower portion of the case body 53 and covers the rear wheel.  Further, the second securing portion 56 is formed at a lower portion of the rear fender 55, and the third securing portion 57 is formed at a rear portion of an edge of the case body 53.  Consequently, the air cleaner 36 can be arranged at a predetermined position<br><br>
                          27<br><br>
above the rear wheel 17. [0049]<br>
It is to be noted that the shapes of the front and rear side cases 46 and 47 of the air cleaner 36 illustrated in the embodiment of the present invention are a mere example, and, for example, depending upon the specifications of the engine, the capacity of the air cleaner or the position of the crankcase 64 at which the air cleaner is secured may be changed.  Also the position of the air entrance 51 can be changed. [0050] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effects due to the configuration described above.<br>
According to claim 1, an arrangement structure of an  air cleaner for a scooter type vehicle wherein a power unit including an engine, a transmission, and a support shaft for a rear wheel integrated with one another is supported for rocking motion on a vehicle body frame is configured such that a crankshaft of the engine is disposed sidewardly of the rear wheel while a carburetor is disposed above the engine, and the air cleaner is disposed sidewardly of the carburetor above the rear wheel.  Therefore, an air exit of the air cleaner<br><br><br>
                               28<br><br>
substantial coincides with the carburetor in its heightwise direction, and the air exit i. proximate to the carburetor in a forward and backward direction. Therefore, a connecting tube for connecting the air cieaner to the carburetor need not be bent by a great<br>
to the air cleaner past the carburetor can be increased to increase the capacity of the intake pipe and raise the intake efficiency.<br>
[0051]<br>
Further, where the connecting tube is formed in an<br>
L-shaped bent configuration and is set to a desired length, the intake air resistance can be suppressed to a desired value. [0052]<br>
According to claim 2, the air cleaner includes a front side case and a rear side case divided in forward and backward directions of the vehicle, and the rear side case is secured to the engine' side while the carburetor is connected to the rear side case by a connecting tube. Therefore, the rear side case is secured to the engine side, and by opening a vehicle body cover and removing the front side case of the air cleaner, maintenance of an element can be performed readily.<br><br>
                                29<br><br>
[0053]<br>
According to claim 3, a vehicle body cover, which covers the upper side of the engine below the seat, is supported for pivotal motion in upward and downward directions around a hinge provided on a rear side of the vehicle body.  Therefore, even where the arrangement structure of an air cleaner of the present invention, a space can be assured around the air cleaner and no much time is required for inspection of the air cleaner. [0054]<br>
Further, since the vehicle body cover, which covers the upper side of the engine below the seat, is pivoted upwardly and downwardly around the hinge provided on the rear side of the vehicle body, even where the crankshaft of the engine is disposed sidewardly of the rear wheel and the carburetor is disposed above the engine, a great space can be assured around the engine. [0055]<br>
According to claim 4, the vehicle body frame is a pipe frame.  Therefore, since the vehicle body frame is not a monocock frame integrated with a cover, maintenance of the air cleaner and so forth can be performed readily by removing the cover.<br><br><br>
                                 30<br><br>
