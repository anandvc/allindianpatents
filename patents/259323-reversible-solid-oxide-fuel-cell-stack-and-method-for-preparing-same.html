				<td>Reversible solid oxide fuel cell stack and method for preparing same Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a reversible solid oxide fuel cell stack and a method for preparing same.<br>
Background art<br>
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC's) are well known in the art and come in various designs. Typical configurations include a flat plate design and a tubular design, wherein an electrolyte layer is sandwiched between two electrodes. During operation, usually at a temperature from 500 °C to 1100 °C, one electrode is in contact with oxygen or air and the other electrode is in contact with a fuel gas.<br>
Several properties are required for the SOFC's, such as high conductivity, a large area of electrochemically active sites at the electrode/electrolyte interface, chemical and physical stability over a wide range of fuel atmospheres, and minimal microstructural changes with operating time, since such changes are often accompanied by deterioration of electrical performance.<br>
Under typical operating conditions, a single cell produces less than 1 volt. To obtain high voltage and power from the SOFC's, it is therefore necessary to stack many cells together.<br>
The most common manufacturing method for SOFC planar stacks comprises the manufacture of single cells. The cells are subsequently stacked together with interconnects, current collectors, contact layers and seals. After assembly the stacks are consolidated/sealed by heat treatment under a vertical load, to ensure sealing as well as electrical contact between the components. The mechanical/electrical coherence of the stack during operation is ensured by applying a constant vertical load (using, e.g., a yoke).<br><br>
The cells are most commonly manufactured by the use of wet powder processing techniques which comprise tape-casting of the support component (typically the electrolyte or anode). The cell support component is normally made by tape casting of a powder suspension and the active layers (cathode, electrolyte and anode) are subsequently deposited onto the support by spray painting or screen printing, with intermediate sintering steps for the different layers.<br>
Alternatively SOFC's are for instance manufactured by electrochemical vapour deposition (CVD) method or plasma spraying. However, said processes are very expensive, and thus there has been a desire to lower the fabrication costs.<br>
Consequently, when a planar SOFC is designed, one emphasis is to minimize sealing and sealing surfaces because the seal requirements are very stringent. Suitable high-temperature sealants being used include cements, glasses and glass-ceramics. A seal-ant selected for planar SOFC's must have sufficient stability in oxidizing and reducing environments, chemical compatibility with cell-stack components, and proper sealing and insulating properties. Examples of glass and glass-ceramic sealants being developed for planar SOFC's are modified borosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses.<br>

However, there are a number of disadvantages with the designs and manufacturing procedures of SOFC stacks hitherto known:<br>
1.	True monolithic planar stacks are not obtained since the mechanical integrity of<br>
the stacks requires a permanent mechanical load to maintain sealing and electrical<br>
contact during operation.<br>
2.	The manufacturing processes are complicated and comprise numerous sintering<br>
steps or expensive chemical or physical deposition techniques.<br>
3.	In the case of sintering of the electrodes, there are two drawbacks:<br>
a.	Due to the required sintering temperatures, performance limiting interface<br>
reactions are often observed between the electrodes and the electrolyte<br>
andfor interconnect;<br>
b.	During sintering it is not possible to maintain sufficient fine microstructures<br>
in the electrode and in the electrode/electrolyte interface due to excessive<br>
grain growth.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in more detail.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method for preparing a flat plate design SOFC stack with an external manifolding, and to a SOFC monolithic stack obtainable therewith.<br>
The stack is made up of two components. The first component comprises at least one porous metal-containing layer 1. Preferably, the first component comprises at least two porous metal-containing layers 1 and 2, and more preferred the component comprises at least three porous metal-containing layers 1, 2 and 3.  The component has a graded, porous structure.  The grading is made by combining a number of layers which can be varied with respect to the composition, such as metal; electrolyte-metal; porosity, such as filler elements, the addition of tubes/fibers which bum away during sintering; and layer thickness. The thicknesses of layer 1 and 2 are in the range of about 20-70 urn and more preferably about 30-40 urn. The thickness of layer 3 is in the range of about 200 -1000 , preferably about 300-700 ^irn, and more preferably about 400-500<br><br>
In Figure 1, a first component having three porous metal-containing layers 1, 2 and 3 is shown. Layer 1 has the lowest porosity. An electrolyte material is added to the least porous layer to improve bonding with the electrolyte. The component of figure 1 further has a layer 2 having a medium porosity below the electrode layer, followed by a layer 3 having a high porosity.<br>
The porosity of layer 1 is from about 20-70%, preferably from about 30-60% and more preferably from about 40-50%. The average pore size is from about 0.5-5 urn, preferably from about 0.5-3 \jtrn and more preferably from about 1-2 urn. If the first and/or second component comprises more than one metal-containing layer, the porosity of layer 2 is from about 30-70 pm, and the porosity of layer 3 is from about 30-80 urn. The average pore size is about 2-4 urn and about 3-10 urn, respectively. Porosity and pore sizes are measured by mercury intrusion (Hg-porosimetry).<br>
All layers may be manufactured by tape casting. The slurries from which the tapes are cast contain the materials in powder form, to which binders, surfactants, solvents, various organic additives and other auxiliary components may be added. The ingredients may be ball-milled together and then tape-cast into the respective layers, for example with a doctor blade system. The layers are then laminated together.to form a first component, as shown in Figure 2. Preferred additives for the suspensions for tape-casting are surfactants such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), binders such as polyvinyl butyral (PVB), and solvents such as a mixture of ethanol and methylethylketone (EtOH + MEK).<br>
The material for the porous metal containing layers 1,2,3, is selected from the group of Fei.x.yCrxMay alloy, wherein Ma is Ni, Ti, Ce, Mn, Mo, W, Co, La, Y, or Al, and or NiO + metal oxides such as TiO2 or Cr203. The layers may also contain doped ceria or doped zirconia. Suitable dopants are Sc, Y, Ce, Ga, Sm, Gd, Ca and/or any Ln element, or combinations thereof. Preferred dopants for zirconia are Sc or Y. A preferred dopant for ceria is Gd. Ln - lanthanides.<br>
The average grain size (dso) for the metal powder is typically in the range of about 3-25 jim and more preferably in the range of about 7-15 yon. The average grain size for the oxide powders is in the range of about 0.05 to 5 p.m and more preferably about 0.1-1 jim.<br><br>
After lamination an electrolyte layer 4 is sprayed at least on top of the first component. It may also be applied to the sides thereof, as shown in Figure 2. In case the first component comprises at least two porous metal containing layers 1,2 having a different porosity, the layer with the lowest porosity of the at least two layers is the layer on which the electrolyte layer 4 is applied.<br>
Preferably, a barn'er layer 9 may also be added prior to spraying the electrolyte on at least the top. The barrier layer 9 may be formed from doped ceria. Suitable dopants are Sc, Y, Ce, Ga, Sm, Gd, Ca and/or any Ln element, or combinations thereof. Preferably, the layer has a thickness of from about 0.1 to about 1 pm. The barrier layer 9 prevents interface reactions between the electrolyte and electrode.<br>
The second component comprises at least one porous, metal containing layer 1, preferably at least two porous metal containing layers 1 and 2, and more preferably at least three porous metal containing layers 1, 2 and 3. The layers of the second component correspond to the layers of the first component described above. An interconnect layer 5 is applied at least on top of the metal containing layer. If the second component comprises at least two porous metal containing layers 1, 2 having a different porosity, the layer with the highest porosity of the at least two layers is the layer on which the interconnect layer 5 is applied, it may also be applied to the sides thereof, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the first and the second component after an electrolyte layer 4 and an interconnect layer 5 have been applied thereon, respectively.<br>
An alternative procedure compnses the lamination of a dense foil, such as a Fe22Cr foil, with the above mentioned layers. In this case the dense foil is laminated on the layer 3 side and suspensions are only sprayed on the edges of the base component. Fe22Cr comprises about 22% by weight of Cr, optionally small amounts of additives, and Fe for balance.<br>
Furthermore, it is in some cases preferred to add sintering promoters/inhibitors to one or more of the above layers in order to control and match the shrinkage profiles during sintering.<br><br>
The tapes are then cut into suitable lengths, for example with a knife or by laser cutting. The first components and second components are stacked in an alternate order such that the electrolyte layer of the first component contacts the surface of the second component being opposite to the surface of the second component which is covered with the interconnect layer 5, as shown in Figure 4. If the first and second components are as described above, wherein the top and also the sides of the component are covered with an electrolyte/interconnect layer, and then cut into suitable lengths, only two opposing sides of the first and second components are covered with the electrolyte/interconnect layer. In this case, the first and second components are stacked such that the second component is turned 90°, as shown in Figure 5. Preferably, the stack is then hot pressed.<br>
The thus obtained stack is sintered under reducing conditions at a temperature of preferably from about 900 °C to about 1500 °C. The sintering procedure for the flat plate design comprises a vertical load on the stack of 50 - 250 g/cm2. The stack is heated at an increase of about 20-50 °C/h to about 500 C°C under flowing air. After 1-10 hours dwell time, the furnace is evacuated and H2 introduced. After 2-10 hours dwell time, the furnace is heated with a temperature increase in the range of about 50-100 °G/h to the sintering temperature and left for 1-10 hours before cooling to room temperature. In some cases more than one sintering temperature may be used. For instance 2 hours at 1100 °C followed by 4 hours at 1250 °C.<br>
After sintering of the stack, the electrodes are impregnated. In case of the cathode impregnation, the cathode gas distribution channels are used. In case the components have more than one layer, due to the graded porosity, the capillary forces will tend to move the cathode material into the most dense layer, the cathode layer. The infiltration is preferably performed more than one time. Further, preferably nitrates are used as the starting materials, in which case an intermediate heating step is employed for the decomposition of the nitrates, which provides more space for the next impregnation, since the volume of oxides are less than that of the nitrates.<br>
Suitable materials for forming the cathode by impregnation include a material selected from the group of LSM (Lai-xSrx)MnO3^), (LnLxSrJMnOw, (Ln1.xSrx)Fe1.yCoyOM, (Y,.xCax)Fei.yCoyOw, (Gd1.xSrx)Fe1.yCoyOw, (Gd^Ca^fe^CoyO^, (Y,Ca)Fei.yCoyOW}f doped ceria, and doped zirconia, or mixtures thereof. Ln = lanthanides.<br><br>
6 in the above formulae is a number for the oxygen deficiency in the lattice and is dependant on composition and the actual oxygen partial pressure (as pO2 decreases 5 wiil increase). The number will typically be between 0 and about 0.3.<br>
As described for the cathode impregnation, the anode is impregnated accordingly. Suitable materials for forming the anode by impregnation include a material selected from the group of Ni, Ni-Fe alloy, doped ceria, and doped zirconia, or mixtures thereof. The dopants are the same as mentioned earlier. Alternatively MasTi1.xMbxO3^, Ma = Ba, Sr, Ca; Mb = V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Th, U; 0 s s * 0.5; or LnCr,.xMxOw, M = T, V, Mn, Nb, Mo, W, Th, U may be used as anode materials.<br>
Instead of tape casting individual layers and subsequently laminating them together as described above, the first layer may be tape cast and after drying additional layers may be tape cast on top of the first layer. Alternatively, the individual layers may be rolled from a paste, followed by lamination of the layers. As another alternative, powder pressing may be applied to make the individual layers, followed by lamination. Prior to sintering the laminated layers may preferably be hot pressed.<br>
The electrolyte/interconnect layers may be applied by spraying, as described above. Alternatively, screen-printing; electrophoretic deposition (EPD), possibly followed by i-sostatic pressing; or pulsed laser deposition (PLD) may be used.<br>
Finally, external manifoldings are applied to the sides of the stack.<br>
The reversible solid oxide fuel cell monolithic stack of the present invention is not only suitable to operate under ambient pressure, but may also advantageously be used under elevated pressure conditions, such as the pressure conditions characteristic of gas turbine plants. When, for example, gas turbines are combined with the SOFC stack of the present invention, very high electrical efficiencies larger than 60% are achieved. Some of the heat created by the SOFC stack can effectively be used for the electricity generation in a gas turbine, creating a synergy effect.<br>
Furthermore, due to its true monolithic structure, the SOFC stack of the present invention tolerates anode and cathode side pressure differences, making it much easier to<br><br>
control and contributing to make the balance of the plant construction simpler and more cost effective, as compared to conventional designs.<br>
In particular, the interconnect layers and the porous substrate layers form a backbone providing excellent stability of the monolithic structure.<br>
Preferably, the SOFC stack can be used in a pressure range of up to elevated pressures of about 15 bar, more preferably 10 bar. Elevated pressure in the sense of the present invention is to be understood as being higher than ambient pressure at about 25°C.<br>
The operation under elevated pressure conditions also has the advantage that the electromotive force of the cell (EMF) and hence the power output increases with increasing pressure. Additionally, an increase of the pressure on the cathode side reduces the cathode polarisation losses, also adding to the power increase and thus to the overall improvement in effectiveness.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method for preparing a flat plate design SOFC stack with an internal manifolding, and to a SOFC stack obtainable therewith.<br>
In this case, the at least one porous metal containing layer 1 of the first component of the second embodiment corresponds to the one as described above for the first embodiment. In a first step, gas distribution holes are punched into opposite sides, as shown in Figure 5. The diameter of the holes is typically about 5-7 mm, but may vary in the range of 1-10 mm. Next, the electrolyte layer 4 is deposited on top of the metal containing layer with the gas distribution holes in it. Thereby, the punched gas distribution holes and the four sides of the component are also sealed, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
Thereafter, a sealing layer 6 is deposited on the electrolyte layer 4, as shown in Figure 7. The sealing layer 6 is a thin layer with a preferable thickness of about 20 urn, and comprises the interconnect material(s) already described above for the first embodiment This step may be carried out by spraying or screen-printing. Alternatively a deformable ceramic and/or glass based seal may be used.<br>
Afterwards, holes are punched in the two remaining sides of the first component, as shown in Figure 8. These holes are unsealed at the edges, while the gas distribution holes formed earlier are sealed with the electrolyte layer 4. The gas distribution to the electrode layer below the electrolyte is effected through the unsealed holes.<br>
The second component of the second embodiment is produced as described above for the first component of the second embodiment, with the only difference in applying an interconnect layer 5 instead of the electrolyte layer 4. The interconnect layer is deposited on the most porous part of the component. This is shown on Figure 10-13.<br>
Next, the first and second components are stacked in an alternate order, again with the second component turned 90°, as shown in Figure 9, and preferably hot pressed. In Figure 9, the layer thicknesses are not shown in the correct relative scale. Instead, the sealing layer is very thin, as compared to the stack, so that the electrode layer of the interconnect component comes into a large area contact with the electrolyte from the electrolyte component. Likewise, the current collection/gas distribution layer of the electrolyte component comes into contact with the interconnect component.<br>
The flow distribution for a cross flow design is illustrated in Figure 15.<br>
The process described above results in a cross flow configuration. Should co- or counter-flow configurations be desired, this may be achieved by punching displaced gas distribution holes on the same opposite sides. This is illustrated in Figures 16-19 for the first component. The second component is manufactured accordingly. A benefit of the co- or counter flow is that the cells do not need to be square.<br>
After assembly of the stack, the four external sides of the stack may additionally be sealed by applying a ceramic or glass layer.<br>
Next, the stack is sintered. After sintering the electrodes are impregnated, as described above for the first embodiment.<br>
Third Embodiment<br><br>
In this embodiment, the need for impregnation is lessened by (partial) formation of the anode and the cathode earlier in the process. Therefore, the first component of the third embodiment contains the anode material in the electrode layer. The first component is sintered under reducing conditions, after which a sealing layer 6 and/or contact layer 8 and a cathode layer are deposited. The cathode layer is preferably about 30 pm thick.<br>
The second component of the third embodiment does not contain an electrode layer. After sintering, a sealing layer 6 and contact layer 8 are deposited.<br>
The stack is assembled by stacking the first and second components in an alternate order, and sealing/bonding them at a low temperature of from about 600 °C to about 900°C, preferably of from about 650 °C to about 850 °C.<br>
In the third embodiment, the need for impregnation of the electrodes is considerably reduced. However, a catalyst may still be impregnated on the anode and/or cathode site if necessary. Suitable materials for the impregnation are the same as listed above for the first and second embodiment.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
The fourth embodiment is directed to a tubular design SOFC stack and method for obtaining same.<br>
In this case, the method for preparing the reversible solid oxide fuel cell stack comprises the steps of:<br>
-	providing a base component which comprises an electrolyte layer 11 and at least one<br>
porous metal containing layer 1; wherein at least one porous metal containing layer is an electrode layer;<br>
-	forming the base component into a tube;<br>
-	applying a sealing layer on the ends of said base component;<br>
-	sintering the tube-shaped component onto the tube;<br>
-	welding an interconnector onto the tube;<br>
-	forming anodes and/or cathodes from the porous layers by impregnating the metal<br>
layer with electrode material;<br>
 stacking the tube-like components.<br>
The sintering is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 900 °C to about 1500°C.<br>
Further, the method preferably comprises the step of forming an electrode layer on the inner side of the tube-shaped component by impregnation after the sintering step. Furthermore, the outer side may be impregnated such that an electrode layer is formed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the tube-shaped component is produced by rolling of an uncut laminate comprising at least an electrolyte layer 11 and a porous metal-containing electrode layer 12, and sealing the tube at the seam. Figure 22 illustrates a tube formed<br>
.M<br>
by laminating and rolling. An outer electrode may be deposited on the tube-shaped com-<br>
\ ponent after rolling and sealing. Alternatively, the outer electrode may be deposited on<br>
the laminate prior to rolling and sealing. Figure 26 illustrates a stack configuration.<br>
According to the methods of the present invention which has been described in detail above with regard to specific embodiments, a monolithic stack is formed, based on a basic component made of one or more metal containing layers with varying porosity. The<br>
r,<br>
basic components with electrolyte or interconnect layers are fired together, creating a monolithic stack; only after said steps the electrodes are added by impregnation.<br>
Some embodiments have been described with reference to only a square geometry, but the invention is of course not limited thereto. Other shapes, such as for example a circular geometry, may as well be applied, depending on the desired application of the stack.<br>
In summary, the methods of the present invention as described in various embodiments above have numerous advantages:<br>
1.	The manufacturing process is simplified; a sealed monolithic stack is manufactured<br>
using only one sintering step;<br>
2.	The obtained stack has little or no glass sealing and consists predominantly of metal,<br>
making it very mechanically robust;<br>
3.	The stack can be delivered 'ready-to-use' as a single component;<br><br>
4.	Interface reactions between electrodes and electrolyte or interconnect and electrodes<br>
are prevented or limited by the impregnation after sintering of the porous struc<br>
ture/stack. This results in the formation of high surface area and thus high performing<br>
electrodes.<br>
5.	The process is very flexible;<br>
6.	The high metal content lowers the overall price of the stack;<br>
7.	The high metal content ensures that the current path through a stack is predomi<br>
nantly through metal, which has a high conductivity. This can make non-planar de<br>
signs attractive, i.e. variants of tubular cells, even though the current paths are<br>
longer.<br>
8.	The obtained reversible solid oxide fuel cell monolithic stack is suitable to be used<br>
under pressurised conditions, such as in a gas turbine plant. Thereby, a combined<br>
cycle plant achieves very high electrical efficiencies and the plant can in addition be<br>
simplified.<br>
In the following, the present invention will be further illustrated with reference to detailed examples. The invention is however not restricted thereto.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Manufacture of a monolithic stack with external manifolds<br>
The first step comprises tape-casting of three metal containing layers (layers 1 , 2 and 3, see Figure 1). Suspensions for tape-casting are manufactured by means of ball milling of powders with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and EtOH + MEK as additives. After control of particle size, the suspensions are tape-cast using a double doctor blade system and the tapes are subsequently dried.<br>
Layer 1: The suspension comprises Zro.rBSco.sYo.ozC^-s and Fe22Cr powder in a 1:2 volume ratio. The green thickness is in the range of 50-70 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 50% with a pore size in the range of 1-2 urn.<br>
Layer 2: The suspension is based on Fe22Cr powder using charcoal as a pore-former. The green thickness of the foil is 50-70 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 50%, with an average pore size of about 4 urn.<br><br>
Layer 3: The same alloy composition is used as for layer 2, but in this case with a larger grain size distribution. Cellulose and graphite fibers are used as pore-formers. The green thickness is about 500 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 60% with an average pore size of about 10 urn.<br>
The second step comprises the lamination of the above mentioned foils into the base component, as shown in Figure 2. The lamination is performed by the use of heated rolls in a double roll set-up and takes place in one pass.<br>
The third step comprises spray painting of a ZrovsSco^Yo.ffiO^ suspension on the surface (layer 1 side) and edges of the base component as shown in Figure 2. The suspension is manufactured as described for the suspensions in step 1 .<br>
The fourth step is spray painting of a Fe22Cr suspension on the surface (layer 3 side) and edges of the base component, as shown in Figure 2. The suspension is manufactured as described for the suspensions in step 1 .<br>
In the fifth step, the sprayed laminated tapes are cut into square pieces. This is done by knife punching resulting in sintered areas in the range of 12x12 to 20x20 cm2.<br>
The sixth step comprises the stacking of the two different components in an alternating order, as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
In the seventh step, the stack is sintered. The stack is placed in a furnace under a vertical load of 150 g/cm2. The stack is heated at an increase of about 50 °C/h to about 500 °C under flowing air. After 2 hours of soaking, the furnace is evacuated and H2 introduced. After 3 hours soaking time, the furnace is heated to about 1250 °C with a temperature increase of 100 °C/h and left for 5 hours before cooling to room temperature.<br>
The eighth step is the impregnation of the cathode. The sintered stack is closed on the two sides of the electrolyte sealed edges (see Figure 4) by a rubber seal. A nitrate solu-<br>
-f<br>
tion of Gd, Sr, Co and Fe is vacuum infiltrated into the porous structure. The infiltration is performed four times with an intermediate heating step for decomposition of the nitrates. The resulting composition of the impregnated perovskite cathode is:<br>
In the ninth step the anode is impregnated. The cathode impregnated stack is dosed on the two sides of the interconnect sealed sides (see Figure 4) by a rubber seal. A nitrate solution of Ni, Ce and Gd is vacuum infiltrated into the porous structure. The infiltration is performed five times with an intermediate heating schedule between each infiltration for decomposition of the impregnated nitrates. The resulting composition of the impregnated anode part is 40 vol% Ni and 60 vol% (Ce0.9Gdo.i}O2.5 (after reduction of NiO).<br>
Thus, a monolithic stack ready to be installed in an SOFC system is obtained. Example 2: Manufacture of a monolithic stack with external manifolds (thin cell)<br>
The first step comprises the tape-casting of three metal containing layers (layer 1 , 2 and 3, see Figure 1). Suspensions for tape-casting are manufactured by means of ball milling the powders with various organic additives such as surfactants, binders and solvents (see Example 1) . After control of particle size distribution, the suspensions are tape-cast using a double doctor blade system, and the tapes are subsequently dried.<br>
Layer 1: The suspension comprises Zro./eScazYo.ozOz-a and Fe22Cr powder in a 1:2 volume ratio. The green thickness is in the range of 30-40 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 40%, with a pore size in the range of about 1-2 urn.<br>

Layer 3: The same alloy composition is used as for layer 2, but in this case with a larger particle size distribution. Cellulose and graphite fibers are used as pore-formers. The green thickness is about 250 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 50% with an average pore size of about 8 pm.<br>
The second step is the lamination of the foils obtained in step 1 into the base component, as shown in Figure 2. The lamination is performed by the use of heated rolls in one pass.<br>
The third step is the manufacture of the first base component (see Figure 3} by spray painting a Zro./eSco.aYo.ozOz-a suspension on the surface (layer 1 side) and edges of the base component, as shown in Figure 2. The suspension is manufactured as described for suspensions in step 1 . 0.25 wt % of AI2O3 is added as sintering agent.<br>
The fourth step is the manufacture of the second base component (see Figure 3) by spray painting a Fe22Cr suspension on the surface (layer 3 side) and edges of the base component. The suspension is manufactured as described for the suspensions in step 1 .<br>
In the fifth step the sprayed laminated tapes is cut into squared pieces. This is done by knife punching, resulting in pieces which, after sintering, are shaped in the range of a-bout 12x1 2 to 20x20 cm2.<br>
The sixth step is stacking of the two different components obtained above in an alternating order, as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
In the seventh step, the stack is sintered. The stack is placed in a furnace under a vertical load of 250 g/cm2. The stack is heated at an increase of about 50 °C/h to 500 °C under flowing air. After further 2 hours of soaking, the furnace is evacuated and H2 is introduced. After further 3 hours of soaking, the furnace is heated to 11 50 °C with a temperature increase of 100 °C/h, and left for further 8 h before cooling to room temperature.<br>
In the eighth step, the cathode is impregnated. The obtained sintered stack is closed on the two sides of the electrolyte sealed edges (see Figure 4) by a rubber seal. A nitrate solution of Gd, Sr, Co and Fe is vacuum infiltrated into the porous structure. The infiltration is performed four times with an intermediate heating step for the decomposition of the nitrates. The resulting composition of the impregnated perovskite cathode is:<br>
The ninth step is the impregnation of the anode. The cathode impregnated stack is closed on the two sides of the interconnect sealed sides (see Figure 4) by a rubber seal. A nitrate solution of Ni, Ce and Gd is vacuum infiltrated in to the porous structure. The infiltration is performed five times with intermediate heating between each infiltration so as to decompose the impregnated nitrates. The resulting composition of the impregnated anode part is 40 vol% Ni and 60 vol% (Ceo.flGdo.i)O2-o (after reduction of NiO).<br><br>
The thus obtained stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
Example 3: Manufacture of a monolithic stack with external manifolds (interconnect foil)<br>
The first step is carried out as described in Example 1.<br>
The second step comprises the lamination of the foils manufactured in the first step into a base component, as shown in Figure 2. The lamination is performed by the use of heated rolls in one pass.<br>
The third step is the lamination of a base component hosting the interconnect. An U shaped dense Fe22Cr foil with a thickness of 50-100 pm is laminated together with the foils manufactured in first step. This component comprises thus four layers, with the dense FeCr foil laminated against layer 3. This process results in a second base component as indicated in Figure 3, with the interconnect layer being thicker than shown in the Figure. The lamination is performed by the use of heated rolls in one pass.<br>
The fourth step corresponds to the third step of Example 1.<br>
The fifth step comprises the cutting of the laminated tapes obtained in the second step in square-shaped pieces having about the same size as described for the second base component manufactured in the third step. This cutting is done by knife punching.<br>
The further manufacturing of the stack is then carried out as described in Example 1, steps 6-9.<br>
The obtained stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
Example 4a: Manufacture of a monolithic stack with internal manifolding and cross flow of fuel and oxidizing gas.<br>

The green thickness is about 400 um. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 70% with an average pore size of about 10-15 um.<br>
In the second step, the above mentioned foils are laminated into the base component, as shown in Figure 2. The lamination is performed by the use of heated rolls in one pass.<br>
In the third step, holes are cut in the base component on two opposite sides (as shown in Figure 5), followed by cutting the base component in smaller pieces. The process may be performed with either knife punching or laser cutting. The diameter of the holes is about 5-7 mm, and the size of the base component pieces are in the range of 12x12 to 20x20 cm2 after sintering.<br>

After further 3 hours of soaking, the furnace is heated to 1300 °C with a temperature increase of about 100 °C/h and left for 5 hours before cooling to room temperature.<br>
The twelfth step is the impregnation of the cathode. The in- and outlets to the anode compartment are closed by a rubber seal. A nitrate solution of Gd, Sr, Co and Fe is vacuum infiltrated into the porous structure. The infiltration is performed four times with an intermediate heating step for decomposition of the nitrates. The resulting composition of the impregnated perovskite cathode is: (Gdo.eSr0,4)o.9g(Coo.2Feo.B)O2-o.<br>
The thirteenth step is the impregnation of the anode. The in- and outlets to the cathode compartment are closed by a rubber seal. A nitrate solution of Ni, Ce and Gd is vacuum infiltrated in to the porous structure. The infiltration is performed five times with an inter-<br><br>
mediate heating schedule between each infiltration for decomposition of the impregnated nitrates. The resulting composition of the impregnated anode part is 40 vol% Ni and 60 vol% (Ceo.oGd0.i)O2-5 (after reduction of NiO).<br>
The thus obtained stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>

The eleventh step is the sintering of the stack. The stack is placed in a furnace under a vertical load of 50 - 250 g/cm2. The stack is heated with a temperature increase of about 50 °C/h to 500 °C under air flow. After further 2 hours of soaking, the furnace is cooled to room temperature and a metallic titanium sponge is introduced into the furnace in front of the stack, the furnace is subsequently evacuated and H2 introduced. The furnace is heated to 1300 °C with a temperature increase of about 100 °C/h and left for further 3 hours before cooling to room temperature.<br>
The twelfth step is the impregnation of the cathode. The in- and outlets to the anode compartment are closed by a rubber seal. A colloid suspension of 60 vol % (Gdo.eSro.4)o.99(Coo.2Feo.8)O2-a and 40 vol% (Ce0.9Gdo.i)O2^ is vacuum infiltrated into the<br><br>
porous structure. The infiltration is performed four times with an intermediate heating step.<br>

The resulting stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
Example 6: Manufacture of a monolithic stack with external manifolding and partial impregnation of the electrode<br>
The first step is the tape-casting of four metal containing layers (layer 1, 2, 3, and 4). The suspensions for tape-casting are manufactured by means of ball milling of powders with various organic additives such as surfactants, binders and solvents. After control of particle size distribution, the suspensions are tape-cast using a double doctor blade system, and the tapes are subsequently dried. The composition of the suspensions is adjusted so that the desired porosity as well as sintering shrinkage is achieved.<br>
Layer 1: The suspension comprises 55 wt% NiO and 45 wt% Zro.78Sco.2Yo.o2O2-a. PMMA spheres are used as a pore former. The green thickness is around about 50 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 50%, with a pore size in the range of about 1-2 urn.<br>
Layer 2: The suspension comprises Zro.78Sco.2Y0o2O2.a and Fe22Cr powder in a 1:2 volume ratio. Charcoal is used as a pore-former. The green thickness of the foil is 50-70 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 50%, with an average pore size of about 4 urn.<br>
Layer 3: The suspension is based on Fe22Cr powder using charcoal as a pore-former. The green thickness of the foil is 50-70 urn. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 55%, with an average pore size of about 4 urn.<br><br>
Layer 4: The same alloy composition as for layer 3 is used, but in this case with a larger particle size distribution. Cellulose and graphite fibers are used as pore-formers. The green thickness is about 300 urn. Sintered porosity of the layer is about 60%, with an average pore size of about 10 urn.<br>
The second step is the manufacturing of the first base component by lamination of the foils manufactured in step 1. The lamination of the foils is in the order of layer 1, 2, 3 and 4 and is performed by the use of heated rolls.<br>
The third step is the deposition of the electrolyte on the base component made in the second step by spray painting a Zro./eScaaYo.ozO^-a suspension on the surface (layer 1 side) and edges of the base component, as indicated in Figure 2. The suspension is manufactured as described for the suspensions in step 1.<br>
The fourth step is the cutting of the sprayed laminated tapes in squared pieces. This is done by knife punching, resulting in piece dimensions after sintering in the range of 12x12 to 20x20 cm2.<br>
The fifth step is the sintering of the first base component obtained in steps 2-4. The sintering is carried out as described in the seventh step of Example 1.<br>
The sixth step is the coating of the sintered electrolyte on the first base component with a ceria barrier layer. The layer is deposited by spin coating of a nitrate solution of Ce and Gd. The resulting composition is (Ce0.gGdo.i)O2^.<br>
The seventh step is the manufacturing of the second base component by lamination of foils 2-4 obtained in step 1. The lamination of the foils is in the order of layers 2, 3 and 4, and is performed by the use of heated rolls.<br>
The eighth step is the deposition of the interconnect on the base component obtained in the sixth step by spray painting of a Fe22Cr suspension on the surface (layer 4 side) and edges of the base component, as indicated in Figure 2. The suspension is manufactured as described for the suspensions in step 1.<br><br>
The ninth step is the cutting of the sprayed laminated tapes into squared pieces. This is done by knife punching, resulting in piece sizes after sintering in the range of 12x12 to<br>
20x20 cm2.<br>
The tenth step is the sintering of the second base component obtained in steps 6-8. The sintering is done as described in the seventh step of Example 1.<br>
The eleventh step is the deposition of a Ca-AI-SiO2 based ink on the outer 5 mm on each side of the interconnect sealed side on the second base component.<br>
The twelfth step is the deposition of a cathode layer on the layer 2 side of the second base component. The cathode layer that comprises a 1:1 volume mixture of (La0.6Sro,4)o.99(Coo.2Feo.8)O2-c and (Ceo.gGd0.i)O2^ is deposited by screen printing. The screen printing is carried out as previously described.<br>
The thirteenth step is the stacking of the two different base components in an alternating order.<br>
The fourteenth step is the sealing and bonding of the stack by heat treatment at 850 °C for 2 hours in air. The stack is subjected to a vertical load of 50 g/cm2 prior to the heat treatment.<br>
The fifteenth step is the impregnation of NiO into the anode compartment by vacuum infiltration of Ni-nitrate solution.<br>
The resulting stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
Example 7: Manufacture of a monolithic stack with external manifolding and partial impregnation of the electrode<br>
Example 7 basically corresponds to Example 6, with the exception that layer 1 in step 1 is manufactured with a mixture of a non-nickel containing anode material and Fe22Cr.<br>
The resulting stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
 Example 8: Manufacture of a tubular cell stack<br>
The first step is the tape-casting of an electrolyte layer and two metal containing layers. The suspensions for tape-casting are manufactured by means of ball milling the powders with various organic additives such as surfactants, binders and solvents. After control of particle size distribution, the suspensions are tape-cast using a double doctor blade system and the tapes are subsequently dried. The composition of the suspensions is adjusted so that the desired porosity as well as sintering shrinkage is achieved.<br>
Layer 11: The suspension comprises Zr0.78Sco.2Yo.o2O2-8 The green thickness is in the range of 20-25 urn. The layer is sintered to &gt;96% of theoretical density.<br>
Layer 12: The suspension comprises Zr0 78Sco 2 Yo.ozC^-e and Fe22Cr powder in a 1:2 volume ratio. The green thickness is in the range of 50-70 urn. Sintered porosity of the layer is 50% with a pore size in the range of about 1-2 urn.<br>
Layer 13: The same alloy composition as for layer 12 is used, but in this case a with larger particle size distribution. Cellulose and graphite fibers are used as pore-formers. The green thickness is about 400 um. The sintered porosity of the layer is about 60% with an average pore size of about 10 um.<br>
The second step is the manufacturing of the base component by lamination of the foils manufactured in step 1 . The lamination of the foils is in the order of layer 11,12 and 13, as illustrated in Figure 21 , and is performed by the use of heated rolls.<br>
The third step is the cutting of the base component into a sheet with the dimensions of about 77x300 mm2.<br>
The fourth step is the wrapping of the base component around an yttria stabilized zirco-nia tube with an outer diameter of about 25 mm (see Figure 22).<br>
The fifth step is the filling of the gap between the ends of the sheet with a paste comprising Fe22Cr powder (see Figure 23).<br><br>
The sixth step is inserting the wrapped tube into a larger support tube made from yttria stabilized zirconia (see Figure 24).<br>
The seventh step is sintering under reducing conditions, as described in the seventh step of Example 1.<br>
The eighth step is the welding of an interconnector rod to the tube, as illustrated in Figure 25.<br>
The ninth step is the impregnation of the anode into the porous layer on the inside of the tube. The impregnation is done by vacuum infiltration of Ni-, Ce-, Gd-nitrates, as described in the previous examples.<br>
The tenth step is the depositing of a cathode by dip coating the tube into a slurry containing (Lao.eSr0i4)o.99(Coo.2Feo.8)02-« and (Ceo.gGdo.i)O2!j5 in a 1:1 volume ratio, as illustrated in Figure 26.<br>
The eleventh step is bundling the single tubes into a stack, as illustrated is Figure 27.<br>
The resulting stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
Example 9: Manufacture of a tubular cell stack<br>
The first step corresponds to the first step of Example 7.<br>
The second step is the manufacturing of the base component by lamination of the foils manufactured in step 1. The lamination of the foils is in the order of layer 14,11, 12 and<br>
13	and is performed by the use of heated rolls (layer 14 may be similar to layer 12. Layer<br>
14	is shorter than the other 3 layers so that the distance to the ends of the component<br>
after wrapping is more than about 3 mm, as illustrated in Figure 21.<br>
The third step is the cutting of the base component into a sheet with a dimension of 77x300 mm2.<br>
The fourth to eighth steps correspond to steps four to eight of Example 8.<br><br>
The ninth step is the impregnation of the anode into the porous layer on the inside of the tube. The impregnation is done by vacuum infiltration of Ni-, Ce-, Gd-nitrates, as described in the previous examples.<br>
The tenth step is the impregnation of the porous layer on the outside of the tube. The tube is closed in both ends and a colloidal suspension of about 60 vol% (Gd0.eSro,4)o.99(C°o.2Feo.8)O2-8 and 40 vol% (Ce09Gdo.i)O2^ is impregnated by dipping the tube into said suspension.<br>
The eleventh step is the bundling of the single tubes into a stack, as illustrated is Figure 27.<br>
The resulting stack is ready to be installed in an SOFC system.<br>
