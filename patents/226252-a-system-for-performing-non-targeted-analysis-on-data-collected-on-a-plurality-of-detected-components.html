				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
'['he present invention relates to system of displaying data from analytical instruments. More specifically, the present invention relates to system of displaying data from mass spectroscopy instruments and data structures containing such data.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metabolite profiling is an emerging science that is used in determining gene function, effects of genetic engineering on an organism, substantive equivalence, drug mechanisms of action, adverse drug reaction monitoring and the biochemical basis of diseases. Non-targeted metabolic profiling using FT-ICR-MS identifies a large number of metabolites from complex biological extracts. The final output from such analyses is the masses and intensities of observed metabolites. The masses can be used to determine the molecular formulas, and thus the identity of the metabolites present in the sample, whereas the intensity is used to determine the amount of the metabolite present in the sample. fix comparing the metabolite profiles of different biological samples, metabolite changes can be observed. These biochemical changes can then be used to understand the effect of the experimental event.<br>
Although multiple visuali/ation tools have been developed to display mass spectral and chromalographic data as well as databases to store, organize, and search this type of data, these tools work only for targeted analyses of known molecules. Currently, there is no effective way to display or organize information from multiple non-targeted sample analyses such that a user can quickly identify changes in metabolite profiles.<br>
The ability to view and interpret large amounts of metabolite data is a rate-limiting step in the study of biological systems using non-targeted metabolomic methods. The creation of a process that would allow users to quickly interpret and report their<br>
thelT findings would dramatically reduce the time and thus the cost of functional genomics utilizing non-targeted metabolomics.<br>
There is a need in the art for novel methods of displaying data obtained by analytical instruments. Further, there is a need in the art for novel methods of displaying or visualizing data from large numbers of non-targeted samples. Also, there is a need in the art for methods and data structures to organize and display in a 2-D array format, non-targeted metabolomic data arising from FT-ICR-MS. There is also a need to link the displayed data to additional databases to characterize or analyse further the displayed data.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
The above object is met by a combination of the features of the main claims. The sub claims disclose further advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>

In an aspect of an embodiment, there is provided a method of displaying data obtained from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) of complex multi-component biological samples. The method is described with reference to Figures 1-6. However, reference to the figures is meant for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to limit the invention in any manner.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown data which may be obtained from a mass spectroscopy instrument. The data shown in Figure 1 was obtained by FT-ICR-MS. of a single sample (V'=l) arbitrarily termed #170. Sample #170 comprises 10 components. Each of the components may be characterized by at least an ordered pair (X,Y) of data that is, its neutral mass {nMass (X)) and its intensity (Intensity. (Y)) values. Also shown in Figure 1 are members of elements (NE), molecular formulae, and errors (Err) associated with the formulae, and thus the ordered data may be expanded if desired, for example, but not limited to (X,Y,A,B,C) corresponding to for example, but not limited to (nMass (X), Intensity (Y),NE (A), Molecular Formula#l (B), Err (C)). Determination of molecular formulae and errors associated therewith are easily determined by a person of skill in the art, based on the mass of a component in the sample. There are numerous algorithms known in the art for determining such formulae and any one or a combination thereof may be employed in the method of the present invention.<br>
As will be evident to a person of skill in the art, each independent sample that is analyzed by FT-ICR-MS produces data which may be organized in a manner similar to the data shown in Figure 1. Also, as will be evident to someone of skill La the art* individual samples may comprise one or more identical components, for example., but not limited to as determined by their nMass. These components may be present in similar amounts or dissimilar amounts. Further, individual samples may comprise different components.-<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown mass spectroscopy data obtained for 4 independent samples arbitrarily indicated by sample #s 170, 171, 172 and 173. Each independent sample comprises a plurality of components as shown by the mass numbers and their corresponding intensities. As illustrated, independent sample #170 comprises 10 components, independent sample #171 comprises 16 components, independent sample #172 comprises 10 components and independent sample # 173 comprises 22 components. Also evident by Figure 2 is that the first component in sample#170 having mass 300.057819 and intensity 7.19 x 106 is a unique component that is not found in any of the other independent samples. In contrast, the second component of Sample .170<br>
characterized by mass 300.205935 and intensity 6.84 x 106 is also present in Sample # 171, 172 and 173 as components characterized by mass values of 300.20593, 300.205883, and 300.205886, respectively. As will be evident to aperson of skill in the art, the mass of two identical components resolved by a mass spectrometer in separate analyses may yield slightly different mass values, as shown above. However, there are various methods known-in the-art which may be employed to determine whether-the components are the same, and such methods are fully contemplated by the present invention.<br>
As further shown in Figure 2, spectroscopic data from multiple samples may be combined into a single data structure and optionally sorted and processed to determine all of the unique masses that are present in all of the independent samples. Other information that may be determined includes, but is not limited to the average, standard deviation, and number of times each mass is present hi the samples. Preferably, the information is tabulated in a data structure or an array as shown in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows a data structure tabulating results of the mean masses (average) obtained for each unique component present in ail of the samples analyzed. For example, but not to be considered limiting in any manner, mean mass 300.057819 is the mass of the first component of Sample #170 (see Figures 1 and 2) and comprises a mean intensity of 7.188800 x 106. Since the component is not found in any of the other samples, the standard deviation of its mass and standard deviation of its intensity is 0. In contrast, the mean mass shown as 300.205909 is the average mass of 4 components identified in samples 170, 171, 172 and 173 comprising individual mass values of 300.205935, 300.20593, 300.205883 and 300.205886 and corresponding intensity values-of 6.84 x 106,3.56 x 107,1.43 x 107 and 3.77 x 107 respectively (see Figure 2). Shown hi Figure 3 is the mean mass for all components in the independent samples, standard deviation of the mean mass, mean intensity of all components with common mass, the standard deviation of the mean intensity, the number of samples comprising a unique mass, and the intensity of each mass hi its "respective sample #. In the event that a particular, component is not found in a specific sample #, no value is entered. For example, mean<br>
mass 300.057819 comprising mean intensity 7.188800 x 106 is found only in sample #170 and thus the remaining specific sample intensities cells are blank. Each intensity value listed in the specific sample may be assigned a color code, or other identifiable characteristic based on the magnitude of intensity value, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown a data structure wherein each specific intensity value listed for a specific sample number has been assigned a specific color code depending on the magnitude of the intensity value. For example, but not to be considered limiting in any manner, non-present intensity or intensity values from 0 to less than 1 x 106 are assigned a first color, while intensity values ranging from 2 xlO5 to less than or equal to 2x106 are assigned a second color, and so on. The ranges may be adjusted as necessary and may be defined by any colors desired.<br>
Also contemplated by the present invention, the data in the data structure' may be processed further or displayed in alternate ways. For example, the intensity values for each sample number may be compared to the average intensity of the component for all independent samples for example, but not limited to as shown in Figure 5. Alternatively, but not wishing to be considered limiting, the data may be processed to compare all of the intensities of components in a specific sample, for example, but not limited to sample #170 as shown in Figure 6.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, there is provided ajnetfapd for visualizing multiple FT-ICR-MS metabolite analysis data files that contain mass and intensity values. The method comprises the following steps:<br>
i) selecting the files that are to be visualized;<br>
ii) combining all of the selected files together, sorting all of the metabolites according to their mass, and identifying all of the unique masses that are present in all of the selected files. The average and standard deviation of each unique mass and the average and standard deviation of the intensities observed and the number of files in which the unique mass is found is determined. •<br>
iii) creating a data structure comprising a two dimensional (2-D) array in which the unique mass list defines the vertical axis and the number of files selected defines the horizontal axis. The amount of the metabolite present is displayed in cells defined by the vertical and horizontal axis coordinates according to a user-defined color code. The user may be provided the option of viewing the data in any number of ways, for example but not limited to by a) observed metabolite intensity; b) the ratio or percentage of the observed intensity to the average intensity of that metabolite from the files selected; c) the ratio or percentage of the observed intensity to the observed intensity of one of the selected files, or a combination thereof. Thus, the method allows for the rapid and condensed display or visualization of multiple metabolite data files, As a result, the determination and identification of metabolite changes in complex mixtures may be greatly simplified.<br>
The present invention further contemplates any of the above mentioned data structures. Further, the present invention contemplates any of the above mentioned data structures on a computer readable medium, for example, but not limited to a compact disc, floppy disc, hard drive or the like, as will be understood by a person'of skill in the art.<br>
Also contemplated by the present invention is the data structure of the present invention in combination with necessary hardware, software, or a combination thereof which permits Hie data structure of the present invention to obtain data from or pass data to.one or more other databases, for example, but not limited to natural product databases, metabolic pathway databases, bioinformatics programs or a combination thereof. Further the cells of the data structure can be linked to one or more databases containing all the experimental information regarding the metabolite including, but not limited to the file name, observed mass, observed intensity, quality assurance control data, such as, but not limited to, internal standard data, molecular formulas and mass errors.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the present invention provides a method as defined above wherein the ordered pair of data is derived from a higher ordered data set (Aj-An, X, Y,<br>
in the art, for example, but not limited to<br>
a)	the average or median of all Y values in one or more ordered data sets;<br>
b)	the average or median of all Y values with unique data element X;<br>
c)	an extrinsic value obtained from a program, database or the like; or<br>
d)	a value input by a user.<br>
Thus, the method of the present invention provides a means to analyze, display, visualize and process large amounts of data .from complex samples, such as but not limited to, biological samples and extracts. Further, the method provides a means to analyze the information in a non-targeted and unbiased fashion to determine the differences between samples.<br>
The above description is not intended to limit the claimed invention hi any manner, Furthermore, the discussed combination of features might not be absolutely necessary for the inventive solution.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated in the following examples. However, it is to be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only, and should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Analysis of multiple non-targeted samples<br>
Processed data files from complex samples are first analyzed as described in a previous patent application (No. 2,298,181, Canada, No. PCT/CA01/00111). The results of this analysis are in the format as shown in Figure 1. Data from multiple files are then combined together as shown in Figure 2. At this stage the data is reduced such that only file name, ionization/extraction code, mass and intensity values remain. This, combined file is then processed to determine all of the unique masses. The average, standard<br>
deviation, and number of each unique mass is then determined. This list represents the y-axis. A column is created for each file that was originally selected to be analyzed. This list represents the x-axis. The intensity for each mass found hi each of the files selected is then filled into its representative x,y coordinate as is shown in Figure 3. Coordinates that do not contain an intensity are left blank. Once in the array, the data can be further processed and visualized by using color codes. Three such possibilities are shown. As shown in Figure 4 a user may visualize data by intensity values using color codes without any additional processing; As shown hi Figure 5 a user may further process the data (relative to figure 4) by comparing the intensity to the average intensity of that metabolite from all samples selected; and in Figure 6 the user may further process the data (relative to Figure 4) to compare all of the intensities to a specific file (in this case file 170). Thus, the user can simultaneously display and interpret multiple files. An important consideration is that this method may comprise, but is not limited to a self-creating array. The final x and y axes are may not be determined prior to the creation of the array but during its creation.<br>
