FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a modified ceramic resin for use in dental and related applications, and a process for the preparation thereof<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tailoring of malfunctional organically modified ceramics precursors in the basis for their use as matrices for dental composites including various fillers. Low shrinkage during curing, good mechanical abrasion resistance, suitable elasticity, adhesion to the teeth and good toxicological data led to the successful development of organicaJly modified ceramics as matrix components or matrix with an adapted bonding for dental composite applications. Inorganic-organic polymers are basically known from the prior art and are designated as 'ormocer' or *ormosir. The sol-gel process m the presence of acidic or basic catalysts prepares these polymers.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to propose a modified ceramic resin for<br>
use in dental and related applications which is easy to prepare and is<br>
cost-effective.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a modified ceramic<br>
resin for use in dental and related applications which is a single paste<br>
system.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br><br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular fonn of this embodiment. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and the teachings of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention is provided a modified ceramic resin for use in dental and related applications. According to this invention is further provided a process for the preparation of a modified ceramic res'm for use in dental and related applications, comprising the steps of preparing a precursor followed by hydrolysis of tlie precursor to yield the hydrolysed precursor,<br>
subjecting the hydrolysed precursor to a step of post-condensation to obtain the oligomer,<br>
mixing an inorganic and organic matrix at the molecular level in a solvent and in the presence of a base catalyst to obtain a resin followed by drying and inhibiting the same to obtain the modified ceramic resin.<br>
hi accordance with this invention, and by v/ay of an exemplary embodiment, 0.75-L5 moles of a compound, such as for eg, 1,3-bis (methacryloxy)2-hydroxy propane (MHP) is reacted with (0.7-1.55 mobs) of a compound, such as for eg. chloropropyl trimethoxy siiane in the presence of a basic catalyst at 45-5 5^C for 3-5 hrs. in an  inert<br><br>
atmosphere to obtain the precursor. The catalyst is for eg. benzyl triethyl ainmoiiium chloride aiid the inert atmosphere comprises aii atmosphere of nitrogen. The inhibitor usod is such  as for eg. 4-methoxy phenol It was characterised using infrared spectroscopy.<br>
The second step involved is of 0.8-1.5 moles of the said precursor v^ith 2.4-4.5 moles of distilled water in the presence of a catalyst at a temperature 25-3S^'C for a duration of 6-10 hrs. under constant stirring.<br>
**' The third step involved post-condensation of the hydrolyzed precursor<br>
for a duration of 10-14 hrs. at 25-35'^C followed by washing with<br>
distilled water.<br>
The fourth step involved mixing of organic (90-99.1 parts) and inorganic (0.9-10 parts) matrix at the molecular level by dissolvmg in an organic solvent such as diethyl ether (30-40% solution in ether) in presence of abase catalyst (0.1-5% by weight of reactants) at 25-35''C for duration of 3-5 hrs. The resultant resin is dried at 30-40^^0 for 100-144 hrs. and inhibited with 150-300 ppm inhibitor and stored at 22±2^C.<br>
The catalyst used is preferably a base catalyst such as 0.2 to 10% by weight of the reactants, of benzyltriethylammonium chloride or 0.5 to 2N sodium hydroxide. The refractive index of the resin was measured<br><br>
using an ABBE refractonieter (Model 3T, Atago, Japan). The infrared spectrum w^ recorded using an FTIR infrared spectrophotometer (Nicelet Impact 4000 USA). High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis was carried out using ethanoJ sohition. Methanol was usod as the mohlk phase (Flow rate Iml/m'm, 4S6 tiinabh UV-detector, 210 nm, Waters Associates Model 440).<br>
The inorgtuiic compound is such as for eg. an alkoxide having (he general formula MaOt,(OR)c where M k selected from the group Si, Al, CB. and Ti and (OR) is the methacrylate group, a-4-6 b &gt; I and c = 4-8<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of this invention, there is a second step of formation of an additional network after the build-up of the inorganic network. The resin obtained from the reaction is stort^d at 22-24"C.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of this invention, the product is used for the preparation of a novel dctiVd fiUmg m aterial by using a thinner and filhr. The thinner is selected from compounds such as triethylene glycol dim eth aery late (TEGDMA), ethylene glycol dim eth aery late (EDMA) and other similar monomers and the filler is for eg. silanated quartz. The dental filling material is prepared using<br><br>
20-40 parts of resin mixture with 60-80 parts of filler. The particle size of the filler is less than 5 microns. The filler is treated with 0.5-1.5% by weight of a silane-coupling agent before being mixed with the thinned oligomer. The dental filling composition further comprises additives such as photo initiator, inhibitor and accelerator. The inhibitor (H) also includes UV stabilisers. The photoinitiator is present in 0.1-1% by weight of resin mixture and the accelerator is used in 10-1000 ppm based on the weight of resin mixture. The accelerator is a tertiary amine such as 2-(4"dimethyl aminophenyethyl) ethanol (DMAPEA) or dimethyl paratouiidine (DMPT). Mixing is carried out at room temperature. The paste cutf^s into a hard solid when exposed to a visible light of 440-480 nm wavelength for a period of 20-60 sees. and the cured paste provides a CS 250-300 MPa, DTS 40-40 MPa, FS 70-120 MPa, FM 740 GPa, VMH 80-100 kg/mm^ WS
