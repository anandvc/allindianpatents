FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a prepayment system for electric energy<br>
meters, and more particularly to a more efficient system and method to control the<br>
supply of electric energy and to obtain outstanding information from the meter by<br>
means of the use of contactless intelligent cards.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The energy utilities Companies had carried out the traditional reading<br>
and elaboration of invoices to collect the supplying services after these services had<br>
been used by the consumer-client. Recently, there had been proposed state ;of the art<br>
prepayment systems techniques for the supply of public services for example: light,<br>
water or gas, like a form of overcoming some of the inconveniences of the traditional<br>
collection systems.<br>
 A sort of prepayment system was designed of such form; that the<br>
purchase of the supply of electricity (water or gas) is done directly from a central station<br>
and the information regarding the bought amount then is communicated to the client's<br>
site where this supply is consumed. In the consumption point (local, establishment,<br>
home, etc.) of the client, a measuring deviceis installed and it receives the information<br>
of the prepayment communication and it also confirms the bought amount to the central<br>
station. Typically, the electricity measuring device is installed in the exterior of the<br>
business or home and a terminal that reads the prepayment information is placed along<br>
with the meter or is connected by means of a cable or by the electric supply cables to<br>
 <br>
the meter, which is instead located in the inside. A disadvantage with these type of<br>
prepayment systems is that are difficult to install and expensive. Another problem with<br>
this typical prepayment system is that it doesn't provide two-way communication about<br>
the consumption information, of how the credit is used, where or which meter is using<br>
the credit, and information about tampering done to the meter.<br>
<br>
Another sort of well-known prepayment systems is also based on the<br>
purchase of the electricity supply directly from a sales point previously determined,<br>
being the information of the supply bought amount stored in a magnetic card or in<br>
contact intelligent cards. This particular prepayment system requires the use of an<br>
electronic meter that includes a card reading: device or a magnetic key and a series of<br>
additional control devices to manage the supplying of the electric energy.<br>
Examples of the type of prepayment system above mentioned are<br>
disclosed in The United States of America patent No. 4,240,030 titled "Intelligent<br>
Electric Utility meter" granted to Jess R. Baterman and collaborators on December 16th,<br>
1960, which describes an intelligent meter that uses an insertable magnetic card to<br>
regulate the energy supply. The United States of America patent; No. 4,629,874 titled<br>
"Prepayment metering system" granted on December 16m, 1980; describes a system<br>
that uses an intelligent card and additional elements to determine the credit to regulate<br>
the supply of energy. The United States of America patent No. 4,731,575 "Prepayment<br>
metering system using encoded purchase cards" granted on March 15th of 1988 to<br>
Joseph W. Sloan, discloses a system that uses coded magnetic ribbon cards to<br>
transfer the purchase information from the collection office to the consumer. The U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,795,892 "Pre-paid commodity system" issued on January 3rd, 1989, given<br>
to CIC Systems, Inc., consists of a system that uses a prepayment activated by a<br>
selling card for the supply of electricity, water, gas, etc. The U.S. Patent No. 4,803,632<br>
titled "Intelligent utility system" granted to Utility Systems Corp., issued on February 7th,<br>
1989, describes a type of an externa data processor meter that has a screen that uses<br>
 <br>
reader equipment to accede and recover information, and a card payment reader device<br>
included in the LCD located inside the property. The U.S. Patent No. 4,908,769 titled<br>
"Commodity metering systems" granted to Schlumberger Electronics (UK) Ltd., on March<br>
13* of 1990, discloses a measurement system by prepayment that includes an electronic key<br>
and a slot to receive this electronic key. The U.S. Patent No. 5,146,047 titled "Prepayment<br>
metering system using encoded purchase cards from multiple locations" granted to CIC<br>
Systems, Inc., on September 8*, 1992, is related with a prepayment system to supply public<br>
services using magnetic ribbon cards. The U.S. Patent No. 5,668,538 titled "Modular<br>
electricity meter arrangement having remotely controllable switch" granted to Siemens<br>
Measurements Ltd., on September 16th, 1997, describes a meter disposition that includes a<br>
prepayment module that has a slot to insert intelligent cards, memory cards, etc. The U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,529,883 titled "Prepayment energy metering system with two-way smart card<br>
communications" granted to David M. Yee and collaborators on March 4th, 2003, describes<br>
a prepayment energy measurement system that uses an intelligent card to provide two way<br>
data communication to send information of the client to the supplier of the service.<br>
Indian Patent No. 204139, tided "Electrical Energy Meter", granted to MRK Family<br>
Ltd, in respect of patent application No. IN/PCT/2001/01666/MUM, discloses a meter<br>
comprising : a card reader slot; a display; an interface; a microprocessor; a plurality of<br>
sensors; a multiplexer; a command unit; a relay bank for switching off the electrical energy.<br>
It further describes a contact card-reader system, wherein a contact smart card must be<br>
inserted into the meter via a card reader slot in order to transfer the prepaid amount of<br>
electricity supply into the modified meter. Indian patent application<br>
No.IN/PCT/2001/01186/MUM discloses an electronic purse that is connected to the<br>
prepayment meter by connection means. That is, the electronic purse has to be inserted into<br>
the connection means in order to transfer the prepaid amount to the meter.<br>
 <br>
However, a disadvantage with this type of prepayment meters with magnetic<br>
card reader or contact intelligent card lies on while the reader is being exposed to<br>
receive the prepayment cards, it turns vulnerable to damages (intentionally or not<br>
intentionally) by the user or due to saline atmospheres or high relative humidity.<br>
Another problem arises when the card reader is connected by a cable to the meter,<br>
since this cable is also susceptible to suffer damages. As well when the reader is<br>
incorporated to the meter, the meter has to undergo to important physical changes<br>
increasing its volume and turning it vulnerable to damages by exposing part of it to<br>
the environment, independently of turning them incompatible to the market existent<br>
connectors as the connectors S or A type.<br>
There is still another type of prepayment systems to control the supply of<br>
 <br>
electric energy, are those that incorporate ways of shutting off the supply when the<br>
credit has been finished. An example of such system is disclosed in the U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,959,549 titled "Communal metering system" granted to Andreas J. Synesiou and<br>
collaborators, on September 28; 1999, which describes a measuring system that<br>
supplies electricity previously paid to a plurality of clients, where the supply and the<br>
energy shut off is done in a remote way. A disadvantage of this type of prepayment<br>
systems for electric energy supply control is that they require equipments for<br>
transmission and reception of information (for example, MODEM) toward and from the<br>
power station, besides of being expensive. Another problem with this system is that<br>
doesn't provide information about meter tampering.<br>
Keeping in mind the defects of the previous technique is a purpose of<br>
the present invention to provide a prepayment system to control efficiently the supply of<br>
electric energy in electronic meters ir stalled in the client's site.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a prepayment<br>
measurement system of energy that uses a meter tightly closed and an intelligent<br>
contactless card.<br>
Yet more, another object of the present invention is to provide an energy<br>
prepayment measurement system that incorporates an automatic device for energy<br>
supply shut off.<br>
Is still another object of the present invention to provide an energy<br>
prepayment system for measurement that by means of the use of contactless<br>
intelligent card could provide information to the supplier about the consumption, how<br>
the credit is being used, where or what meter is using the credit, and information about<br>
illicit and tampering done the meter.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an electric energy<br>
supply prepayment method by means of a contactless card-reader system.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventibn refers to the use of a meter completely integrated<br>
in a single piece, totally covered and with no contact with the exterior, that incorporates<br>
a prepayment system and a more efficient;method to control the supply of electric<br>
energy and to obtain excellent information from the meter by means of contactless<br>
intelligent cards.<br>
The prepayment sys'em of the present invention letter includes a<br>
prepayment control contactless card with energy supply shut off that also is in charge<br>
of detecting and validating a prepayment card as well as controlling the prepayment<br>
system and of supplying energy to the meter. In a preferred modality, the prepayment<br>
control contactless card with energy supply shut off includes a reader-writer element of<br>
contactless intelligent cards, a microcontroller, a zero cross detector of the AC voltage<br>
supply, a controller of the supply shut off element and a feeding source of this control<br>
card. The prepayment system of the present invention not all the time is searching for<br>
a contactless prepayment card, since it would waste too much energy for an operation<br>
that is done only few times, so the search of the prepayment card only occurs during<br>
few seconds every minute.<br>
The electric energy prepayment method using a contactless intelligent<br>
card and an electric energy electronic meter with internal reader-writer of contactless<br>
intelligent cards, manages the steps of interchanging information between the meter<br>
and the contactless intelligent cards by radiofrequency; authenticate the intelligent<br>
prepayment card and the internal ree der-writer of contactless intelligent card, in mutual<br>
form, by means of two or more digital signatures and the serial number of the meter;<br>
discharging and storing the credit of the intelligent prepayment card in the memory of<br>
the electronic meter; and storing the information generated about the state of the meter<br>
in the prepayment contactless intelligent card.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The term "CONTACT LESS CARD" as is used hereby, refers to the<br>
interchange of a command between the card and a reader- writer module without the<br>
use of galvanic elements (for example, the absence of a ohmic contact of the reader-<br>
writer module toward the integrated circuit inserted inside the card), where the power<br>
that makes function the integrated circuit inserted in the card, is taken by the command<br>
generated by the reader-writer module, the communication and power toward these<br>
integrated circuits is given by the coupling. Therefore, a contactless card could be<br>
separated from a not constant distance of some millimeters up to several centimeters<br>
 <br>
from the reader writer module and there, is still data transmission between them.<br>
The term "Intelligent Card" refers to a card that its size is similar to a<br>
plastic credit card, with an integrated circuit (microprocessor, memory or dedicated<br>
circuit), with a reader that has the; processing power to be used in several applications,<br>
with great security.<br>
The term "digital signature" or "digital key" means a data sequence, by<br>
which it could deciphered a coded command with the same data sequence.<br>
The term "tampering" as is used in the present invention refers to all the<br>
activities done to alter the consumption registration of electric energy consumed by the<br>
user of the meter.<br>
The term "Disconnections" means the action of de-energizing the electric<br>
energy meter without cutting off the supply of electric energy to the user in such way<br>
that the meter could not register the consumption of energy of the user during the time<br>
that the meter is de-energized. The term "Inversions" means to change the mechanical<br>
position of the meter in the connection socket, with the purpose of discounting or<br>
counting less energy than what is really consumed. The term "Derivations" is used<br>
hereby to imply the bridge of minimum electric resistance placed externally to the<br>
meter, is done with the purpose of that not all the current consumed by the user passes<br>
by the meter sensors and therefore it senses less current than the real amount<br>
consumed by the user, these bridges are commonly known like "bridges".<br>
The "Anticollision" term is an arbitrate among cards in which depending<br>
on the serial number of the cards only one is selected, this is specified in the ISO<br>
14443-3A ISO14443-4A<br>
The present invention provides a prepayment system and meth'od for the<br>
measurement of electric energy with contactless data communication, where the<br>
electronic meter is completely integrated in a single piece, totally covered arid without<br>
any contact with the outside environment. In accordance with the preferred modality,<br>
 <br>
the prepayment system and methoc of energy measurement reduces the installation<br>
cost providing an integral electronic meter that allows the data communication; as much<br>
to the user meter as to the energy utility company, without using the existent power<br>
lines or communication transmission equipments via additional MODEMS. Also, and<br>
according to the preferred modalities of the present invention, the contactless data<br>
communication is provided through a prepayment module of a contactless intelligent -<br>
reader-writer integrated in the electronic meter, where the intelligent card ;transfers<br>
directly to the meter the amount bought data and also receives and stores information<br>
about the variables of the operation of the meter as well as the meter tampering that<br>
are transferred into the data base of the supplier of energy when the contactless<br>
intelligent card is recharged. The. prepayment system of energy allows the payment of<br>
the supplying service before the consumption by using a contactless intelligent card.<br>
This contactless intelligent card is reloaded in a sales point terminal or directly in the<br>
power station of the energy supplier.<br>
In the present invention, the client receives the electricity from the<br>
generating station over the power ines directly in the owner's meter and it is not<br>
necessary to connect the meter to any communication terminal or to an external<br>
equipment that could serve as link (for example, infrared connection, direct cable<br>
connection, a RF connection or communication through a AC line) to control the supply<br>
of electricity.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a simplified diagram of a prepayment system for<br>
energy measurement in accordance to the preferred modality of the present invention.<br>
As it is shown in Figure 1, the prepayment system for energy measurement preferably<br>
includes terminals of sales point 20 that could be located in the central station and/or in<br>
the collection offices of the supplier. The terminals of point of sale 20 are equipped with<br>
a reader-writer module of intelligent cards 23, which could be of conventional type for<br>
contactless cards or it could be one of a specific development. The terminal of point of<br>
 <br>
sale 20 has a communication interface 27 to interconnect itself through server a 21 with<br>
a collect system that maintains informed about the clients' bills and of the information<br>
stored in the data base 22 of the supplier. The communication method used in the<br>
interface 27 could be, for example, through a MODEM using the Internet net or an<br>
intranet, or a dedicated link. The data base 22 also will store the quantity of<br>
prepayment kWh bought by the user, the kWh measured during the life of the meter, as<br>
well as the tampering done by the user for its analysis and to: take actions in place of<br>
the energy utilities company.<br>
To provide a secure communication as well as validating the<br>
transmission-reception of data between the terminal of point of sale 20 and the server<br>
21, the prepayment system for enorgy measurement will include a pair of security<br>
modules 24 and 25 that, as is observed in figure 1, are to be installed as well in the<br>
server as in the points of sale. Preferably, 'the security modules 24 and 25 provide<br>
encryptation and deencryptation functions for the data transmission between server 21<br>
the terminal of point of sale 20, for example by means of the use of digital keys in<br>
which the data will be only deencrypted through the use of such digital keys, so when<br>
data is transmitted from the terminal of point: of sale toward the server and vice versa,<br>
even when the transmission of this data could be intercepted, this data would not be<br>
deciphered if the deencryptation keys are not available. The transmitted data between<br>
the terminal of point of sale 20 and the prepayment intelligent card 15 are encrypted by<br>
the security module 24 by the use of digital keys written in the intelligent cards 15. The<br>
security module 24 also provides; the security of the data for the transactions that are<br>
done by the contactless intelligent card 15 and writer-reader module of intelligent card<br>
23. Preferably, the contactless intelligent card 15 and the electronic meter 18 also<br>
include the encryptation / desencryptation modules installed in their respective<br>
microcontroller or integrated circuit (IC) for specific use for prepayment systems to<br>
perform this interchange function of encrypted information. In a particularly preferred<br>
 <br>
modality, the encryptation module of the electronic meter is located in the<br>
microcontroller of a prepayment control contactless card with energy supply shut off or<br>
could be in the Reader of the contactless intelligent cards.<br>
At the moment of Hiring or renovating the electric energy supply service,<br>
the energy utilities company will install an electronic meter with the prepayment system<br>
of the present invention in the home of the user 19 and will hand over a reusable<br>
prepayment contactless intelligent card 15 previous loaded with certain amount of kWh<br>
prepaid in a point of sale 20. In a preferred modality, the prepayment contactless<br>
intelligent card 15 will be personalized with the information stored-in the memory of the<br>
microcontroller, such information would be the number of meter, contract number, last<br>
date of loading the card, security keys [for example: digital signatures as well as the<br>
specified in the Mifare© encryptatior system, (such way, that in the preferred; modality,<br>
a A key is used for discharging certain amount of prepaid kWh and a B, that could load<br>
and discharge certain amount of prepaid kWh in a sector of the card], or a triple<br>
encryptation system DES, etc.), amount of prepaid kWh data, amount of prepaid kWh,<br>
to be transfer to the meter by:discharge. In a particularly preferred modality, the<br>
microcontroller memory of the prepayment contactless card is able to admit and store<br>
information generated by the electronic meter regarding the energy consumed by the<br>
user during the life of the meter and the meter tampering.<br>
In order to start the supply of energy the user will place the contactless<br>
prepayment intelligent card 15 near to the contactless electronic meter reader-writer<br>
18, this reader-writer of the electroric meter will validate the prepayment card 15 and<br>
will discharge totally or partially the amount of prepaid kWh bought. The determination<br>
of the total or partial discharge of the amount of prepaid kWh bought in card 15 to the<br>
meter 18 will depend on the value recorded in the card regarding the amount of prepaid<br>
kWh to be transfer to the meter by discharge or when the credit is minor to this<br>
discharging value. In the present invention the term "quantity of prepaid kWh to be<br>
 <br>
transfered by discharge" is a predetermined amount defined by the user or by the<br>
energy utilities company, lets say that this number would be fifty, when card is placed<br>
near to the prepayment meter, the discharges will be of 50 by 50 kWh except when the<br>
amount of prepaid kWh remaining in the card would minor to 50, in this case will be<br>
discharged the entirety of the amount of prepaid kWh , from the card to the meter.<br>
Simultaneously or after discharging the amount of prepaid kWh, the contactless reader-<br>
writer of the meter will load all the information generated by the electronic meter<br>
regarding the energy consumed by the user during the life of the meter in thecard and<br>
the meter tampering. The electronic meter 118 will continually display in its screen the<br>
information about the remaining amount of the supply of the prepaid electric energy so<br>
the user could go in the right time to a terminal of point of sale 20 to reload to the<br>
contactless intelligent card 15. The terminal of point of sale 20 accepts, reads and<br>
writes data toward and from a prepayment intelligent card 15 specific for the<br>
prepayment system of electricity measurement as is ordered by the program of the<br>
supplier. As it was mentioned, the card can be reloaded in a point of sale 20, but also is<br>
discharged the data gathered by the card about electronic meter to have it sent-to the<br>
data base 22 so it would be revised by the energy utilities company. The terminal of<br>
point of sale 20 accepts amounts either in pesos (or any another currency type<br>
depending of the country) as well as in kilowatts/hour and it communicates back this<br>
transaction to the server 21 of the supplier of the service for its storage in the data base<br>
22. However, this information as it is recorded 15 in the prepayment intelligent card 15<br>
so the user discharges the amount of prepaid kWh in the meter 18 it would be in kWh<br>
form. Therefore, the screen of the meter will display this prepayment information in<br>
kWh form.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a functional electronic meter diagram simplified in<br>
blocks that incorporates the contaotless prepayment system to control the supply of<br>
electric energy and obtains relevant information of it, appropriate to be used in<br>
 <br>
accordance with a preferred modality of the present invention. The energy electronic<br>
meter 18 with prepayment includes an electric energy measurement card 9, a<br>
prepayment control contactless card with energy supply shut off card 3, a device for<br>
shutting off energy supply 1 and an antenna 14.<br>
The electric energy measurement card 9 includes an energy<br>
measurement module 10 that registers the electric energy consumed by the user, a<br>
microcontroller 11 that controls the operation of the energy measurement module 10<br>
that has a flash memory to store:the information of the prepaid electric energy that is<br>
discharged from the prepayment control contactless card 3, as well as the information<br>
generated in the measurement module 10 regarding the energy consumed by the user<br>
during the meter life and the meter tampering (for example, disconnections, inversions,<br>
presence of derivations, etc.) a liquid crystal display 13 controlled by a microcontroller<br>
that displays, among other variables, the information of the available energy previously<br>
paid by the user, when could it be discharged the quantity of prepaid kWh from the<br>
contactless card 15, and special information that indicates the user to place the card<br>
near the meter to start the discharge of the quantity of prepaid kWh and a<br>
independent feeding source 12 for the measurement module 10 and the<br>
microcontroller 11 of the energy messurement card 9. The energy source works when<br>
there is supply of electric energy, it works at most for one second when there is a<br>
supply failure, time enough to back up the information of any energy transaction.<br>
The prepayment control contactless card with energy supply shut off<br>
card 3 is the main module entrusted of detecting and validating a prepayment card 15<br>
as well as controlling the prepayment system and the energy supply to the meter. In a<br>
preferred modality, the contactless prepayment control and energy shut off card 3<br>
includes a reader-writer element of contactless intelligent card 8 that also has a<br>
radiofrequency generator, a microcontroller 7, a cross zero detector of the AC voltage<br>
supply 6, a controller of the of the supply cutting off element 5 and a feeding: source 4<br>
 <br>
of this control card 3. The prepayment control contactless card with energy supply shut<br>
off card 3 not always is looking for a contactless prepayment card 15, since it would<br>
waste too much energy in an operation that is rarely done so the search of the<br>
prepayment card 15 only occurs a few seconds every minute.<br>
The reader-writer element for contactless prepayment card system of<br>
the present invention provides, in a first way, the information of the prepayment<br>
intelligent card 15 to a microcontroller 11 of the electronic meter 18 by means of the<br>
microcontroller 7. In a second way, the reader-writer element for contactless cards 8<br>
provides the information of the micrccontroller 11 of the meter 18 toward the intelligent<br>
card 15 through this microcontroller 7. The communication of information among the<br>
contactless intelligent card 15 and the electronic meter 18 is done through a printed<br>
circuit antenna and one inserted in he contactless prepayment card (of the meter and<br>
of the prepayment cards 14 and 17, respectively, which are sensitive to the<br>
radiofrequency band in which are transmitted. Preferably, the reader- writer element of<br>
cards 8 is an integrated circuit that detects the presence of a contactless prepayment<br>
card, interprets the commands of the contactless prepayment card, and generates and<br>
sends a radiofrequency power command. This antenna 14 also captures the changing<br>
commands of radiofrequency power sent being the radiofrequency transmission<br>
protocol the specified in. the standard ISO 14443-3A, and even the specified by the<br>
standard ISO 14443-4A or any; other radiofrequency transmission of data protocol<br>
appropriate for such objective.<br>
The reader-writer element of contactless card 8 generates and sends a<br>
radiofrequency power command through the antenna 14 to the meter 18. The<br>
changing command for radiofrequency power perceived by the antenna 14 is caused<br>
by the presence of a contactless prepayment intelligent card 15. Upon detecting the<br>
reader-writer element of contactless card 8 the presence of a prepayment card 15,<br>
reads and transfers the prepaid amount of the contactless prepayment card 15 to the<br>
 <br>
microcontroller 7 previous verificaton and; validation of card 15 by means of a<br>
encryptation a deencryptation of this reader-Writer of contactless cards 8. This means,<br>
the encryptation / deencryptation module of the reader-writer of the contactless cards 8<br>
verifies and validates via digital signatures the information stored in the memory of the<br>
microcontroller or IC of specific use for prepayment cards 16 of the card 15 as, for<br>
example, the meter number, contract number, last date of loading the card, security<br>
keys, data of the, amount of prepaid kWh data, quantity of prepaid kWh to be transfer<br>
to the meter by discharge, etc. If t lis information is not verified and validated, the<br>
reader won't discharge the amount or the prepayment information of card 15 in the<br>
electronic meter 18.<br>
Once verified and vaidated the contactless prepayment card 15, the<br>
data of the prepaid amount of the electric energy supply is discharged from the<br>
contactless intelligent card 15 to the electric ;energy measurement card 9, through the<br>
prepayment control card 3, where the. electric energy measurement card 9 is in charge<br>
of reducing the amount of energy as well as the user is consuming it. In general, the<br>
information of the amount or the quantity of prepaid kWh is stored in the flash memory<br>
of microcontroller 11 of the ^electric energy measurement: card 9 and this<br>
microcontroller 11 is in charge of controlling the reduction of the prepaid amount of<br>
electric energy supply as the user consumes one kWh in base of the consuming<br>
information sent by this energy meas jring module.<br>
In an alternate way, the relevant information about the historical data of<br>
the meter that will be recorded in the contactless intelligent'prepayment card 15 would<br>
also be stored in the microcontrolle- 11 Flash memory of he measurement card 9.<br>
Therefore, the interchange of information between the electronic meter 18 and the<br>
intelligent card 15 is particularly; done by the microcontroller 7 of the prepayment<br>
control card 3 and the microcontroller 11 of the measurement card through a serial<br>
interface. In other words, the microcontroller 11 is the element that stores the<br>
 <br>
information in its Flash memory, while microcontroller 7 detects the presence of a card<br>
15 it reads the data stored in the Flash memory of the microcontroller 11 through a<br>
serial interface and it also reads the data of the prepayment card 15 through the<br>
reader-writer of the prepayment cards 8, and works as intermediary to transfer the<br>
information from one system to the oi her.<br>
In an alternating modality oi, the present invention, the prepayment<br>
system for electric energy meters; by contactless intelligent card includes an automatic<br>
supply of electric energy shutting ioff device to the user 19. In particular reference to<br>
Figure 2, where is shown that the prepayment control card also includes a cross zero<br>
detector of electric energy 6 and a controller supply shutting off device 5 that manages<br>
a device that shuts off / reestablishes the supply of energy 1. In.a preferred; modality<br>
of the present invention, the microcontroller 7 of the prepayment control card 3 knows<br>
how much electric energy is left to be consumed by the user because it reads this<br>
information from the electric energy measurement card 9. Therefore, microcontroller 7<br>
will control the supply or will shut off the.electric energy to the user 19.<br>
Typically, the electric energy shut off to the user 19 will occur when the<br>
available amount of energy stored in the electric energy measurement card 9 of meter<br>
18, that is read by microcontroller 7, would be equal to zero. The electric energy<br>
supply will be reestablished when the available amount stored in electric energy<br>
measurement card 9 that is readiby microcontroller 7, would be greater than zero. All<br>
the time, the microcontroller 7 of the prepayment card 3 will read the available amount<br>
. of electric energy for the user from th3 energy measuring card 9.<br>
The shut off or reestablishmsnt of energy supply is provided by a controller<br>
device of. the supply shut off and failure alarm 5, where the supply. shut off<br>
/restablishment device 1 could be, ir a preferred modality, a relay. The energy supply<br>
could be shut off by the relay and failure alarm controller 5, this, controller 5 has the<br>
function of opening as much as closing the relay 1 when microcontroller 7 requires it<br>
 <br>
through a shut off or opening command, the controller 5 opens or closes the relay by<br>
mean of a solid state device 2 . Also, the relay and failure energy alarm controller 5<br>
also advices the microcontroller 7 if a failure of energy has occurred, this is aware of<br>
the electric energy failures by a c oss zero detector 6, so. it takes the necessary<br>
precautions and the information doss not get lost during any failure of the electric<br>
supply. All these devices are fed by t ie feeding source 4.<br>
When the microcontroller 7 reads that an available amount of energy<br>
stored in the electric energy measurement card equal to zero, thisjmicrocontroller 7 will<br>
send a shut off command to the of the relay and failure of energy control 5. The relay<br>
and failure of energy control 5 inclides a microcontroller (not shown) that has three<br>
entering ports and of two exit ports. Dne entering port of the microcontroller serves for<br>
indicating that it should close the relay of shutting off or supplying;of energy 1,. Another<br>
entering port of the microcontroller serves to indicating it that it should open the shut off<br>
or supplying of energy.relay 1, while the last entering port of the microcontroller<br>
indicates the cross zero AC line (it means, by the ground of the; circuit or zero volts),<br>
the command that indicates the cross through zero also indicates the polarity toward it<br>
has crossed the AC supply. In other words, this last entering port indicates the moment<br>
when the phase has become positive with regard to the neutral (that is the ground of<br>
the prepayment module card 3) anc vice versa (the phase has become negative.with<br>
regard to the neutral). This function is given by the cross zero detector of electric<br>
energy 6 (this is a level detector circuit with an histeresis carried out with Operational<br>
Amplifiers and a voltage divisor), the zero cross is used for two purposes: one is when<br>
the microcontroller of the control of failure of energy relay 5 (not shown) detects that<br>
there is no zero crossings then is inferred that the supply of electric energy has been<br>
suspended and that will generates a lack of supply of electric energy in the prepayment<br>
control contactless card with shut of of supply of energy 3, in that moment it sends by<br>
one of its exits a command to indcate to the microcontroller 7 that must;keep the<br>
 <br>
convenient information for its own good operation and for not loosing the transactions<br>
data that it could being carrying out. The second purpose is the .function of opening and<br>
closing the relay 1, to be closed this relay should receive a command of direct current<br>
(DC) between its activation terminas, and to be opened it must also receive a DC<br>
command but in an inverse way to the command that closes it, so to activate it upon<br>
detecting the zero crossing and polarity of the electric supply of AC, one could open<br>
the relay activating a solid state devi oe 22 when the polarity of the phase is negative in<br>
regard to the neutral and closing it by activating the solid state device 2 when the<br>
phase is positive,in regard to the neutral. On the contrary, when ;the microcontroller 7<br>
reads an available amount of energy greater than zero, this microcontroller 7. will send<br>
a supplying command to the microcontroller of the relay and failure alarm control,<br>
which activates the solid state device 2 of the energy zero cross detector 6 during a<br>
positive line cycle. It should be understand that the supply shut off and energy failure<br>
alarm controller device 5 could be ncorporated in a small card or like an additional<br>
function of the microcontroller 7 of tr e contactless prepayment,and energy supply shut<br>
off card 3.<br>
As itwas previously meitioned,;the intelligent card 15 will be reusable and<br>
specific for each meter; it means that it must be used in only one specific meter. The<br>
intelligent card includes a microcontroller or circuit of specific use in contactless<br>
prepayment cards 16 and an antenna 17. The personalized information of the card is<br>
recorded in the internal memory of microcontroller 16. Preferably, the intelligent card<br>
could be of the size of a conventional credit card and still being: in the standard ISO<br>
14443-1, 14443-2, 14443-3, 14443-'-, although this is not obligatory. Likewise, the use<br>
of contactless prepayment intelligent cards in a prepayment system of supply of<br>
electric energy for electricity meters of the present invention has three main functions:<br>
1) discharging the amount of prepad kWh :to be integrated to the energy electronic<br>
meter; 2) to receive the data of consumed energy during the entire life of meter, meter<br>
 <br>
tampering such as disconnections, ir versions and presence of: derivations, without the<br>
necessity of hiring a reader or incorporating sophisticated and expensive systems; and<br>
3) to avoid failures and mechanical wasting of the meter.<br>
In operation, the prepayment; system of electric energy by contactless<br>
intelligent cards of the present invenion is loaded to the meter through the contactless<br>
prepayment control contactless care with energy supply shut off; that carries out the<br>
operations of detecting and validating a prepayment card, as well as controling the<br>
prepayment system and supply • of energy :to the meter in accordance to. the flow<br>
diagram of Figures 3 and 3A. In a particular way, the microcontroller 7 of the<br>
contactless prepayment control and energy supply shut off card .3 and it controls the<br>
prepayment system of the present invention, as well as the communications regarding<br>
the prepayment between meter 18, prepayment card 15 and energy measurement card<br>
9, and has an independent operalion from the rest of the microcontrollers of the<br>
system.<br>
Before beginning the control and communication functions,<br>
microcontroller 7 initializes the communication serial ports; with which it will<br>
communicate with the microcontroller 11 ,and configures the reader-writer of the<br>
contactless intelligent cards 8 so it would works in accordance with, for example, the<br>
standard ISO 14443-4A. Once initial zed the ports and configured ;the reader-writer, the<br>
microcontroller 7 reads the data stared in the electric energy measurement card 9,<br>
such as the client serial number; stored kWh during the meter life, disconnections #,<br>
inversions #, derivations and accumulated energy during the presence of derivations<br>
(the serial number of the meter will only be. read in this part of the program because<br>
this never changes). After reading the data, an internal, temporizer of the<br>
microcontroller 7' is initialized so; it generates an interruption each 70 milliseconds so<br>
this microcontroller 7 does a specific task. Microcontroller 7 then is set on inactive<br>
state, it means that stops doing any task and goes to "sleep" to save the maximum of<br>
 <br>
energy, is of vital importance save energy to meet the standards and avoiding<br>
monetary unnecessary losses to the energy: utilities company. Microcontroller 7 could<br>
only come out from the inactive state by the interruption of the temporizer or by the<br>
interruption of the energy supply failure. .Therefore, the microcontroller 7 of the<br>
prepayment control contactless card with energy supply shut off 3 is waiting for an<br>
interruption, the microcontroller will be in this condition most part of the time.<br>
This way, if the tempo'izer generates a interruption command (block 90)<br>
microcontroller 7,leaves the inactive state and reads the balance of the meter, the<br>
accumulated kWh, the number of disconnections, interruptions, derivations and<br>
inversions (block 100). In an opposite case, microcontroller 7 returns to the inactive<br>
state to save the maximum of ene'gy while is-waiting for an interruption command<br>
(block 80).<br>
Once the microcontro ler 7 does the function of reading the data stored<br>
in the energy measurement card 9 block 100), this verifies and Changes the state of<br>
the relay with regard to the prepayment balance of the user. Microcontroller 7 based on<br>
the information obtained in the block 100 verifies that this prepaid balance of supply<br>
would be greater than 0 (block 110), if the credit isn't greater than cero, then it verifies if<br>
the relay 1 is opened (block 120). If the result of verifying the state of the relay 1 of the<br>
block 120 is negative, then the microcontroller 7 sends a command to the controller of<br>
the device of supply shut off and failure alarm 5 which executes the function of opening<br>
the relay 1 (block 130) to shut off th 5 electric energy supply to meter 18. After opening<br>
the relay 1 in the'block 130, the microcontroller 7 reads the information displayed in the<br>
LCD of the meter 18 (block 160). However, if the result that is:determined in the block<br>
120 is satisfactory, this means that tie relay 1 is open, then the microcontroller 7 reads<br>
the information displayed in the scre3n of .meter 18 (block 160).<br>
Otherwise, if the balance read in the block 110 is greater than,zero then<br>
the microcontroller 7 verifies if the relay 1 is closed (block 140). Iflthe result of verifying<br>
 <br>
the state of the relay 1 of the block 140 is negative, then the microcontroller 7 sends a<br>
command to the controller of the device of supply shut off and failure alarm 5 which will<br>
execute the function of closing the relay 1 (block 150) to aloud the electric energy<br>
supply to the meter 18. After closing the relay 1 in the block 150,:the microcontroller 7<br>
reads the information displayed in the screen of the meter 18 (block 160). Anyway, if<br>
the result that is determined in the b ock 140 is affirmative, this means that the relay 1<br>
is closed, then the microcontroller 7 reads the information displayed in the screen of<br>
the meter 18 (block 160).<br>
Right after the verification of the state of the relay 1 as it was described<br>
in blocks 110 to 160, the microcont oiler 7 verifies through the microcontroller of the<br>
energy measurement module TO thai the screen is displayed in the meter (block 170).<br>
If the screen displayed in block 170 is the one of "prepayment", then the microcontroller<br>
7 verifies if the radiofrequency generator is turned on (block 180) of the contactless<br>
intelligent card reader-writer element 8 and then starts the search of a prepayment<br>
card. If the determination in the bloc c 180 is negative, a command to turn on the radio<br>
frequency (block 190) is generated and then the microcontroller 7 returns to the<br>
inactive state to save the maximum of energy while waiting for a interruption command<br>
(block 80) and restarts the routine describediin blocks 90 to 180. In affirmative case in<br>
the block 180, it means that the radio frequency is turned on, and then the<br>
radiofrequency command will start to be emitted through the antenna 14 to detect the<br>
presence of a contactless intelligent card 15 that is nearby (block 220).<br>
When the displayed screen on block 170 corresponds to the "kWh,<br>
inversions, disconnections, derivations", microcontroller 7 revises if the radio frequency<br>
emission (block 200) is turned off, in case that the radiofrequency emission would be<br>
turned off, the microcontroller 7 returns to the inactive state to save the maximum of<br>
energy while is waiting for a interruption command (block 80) and restarts the routine<br>
described in blocks 90 to 180. If the result of verifying the state of the radiofrequency<br>
 <br>
emission is negative, this means that the radiofrequency emission is turned on, then<br>
the microcontroller 7 turns off or deactivate the radiofrequency emission (block 210)<br>
and then the microcontroller 7 returns to the inactive state to save the maximum of<br>
energy while is waiting for a interruption command (block 80) and restarts the routine<br>
described in the blocks 90 to 180.<br>
After microcontroller 7 have done the functions of reading the data<br>
stored in the energy measurement card 9, verifies and changes the state of the relay 1,<br>
and checks that LCD is displayed in ihe meter to activate/deactivate the radiofrequency<br>
emission, it will proceed to detect tho presence of a contactless intelligent prepayment<br>
card 15 and will do the transaction of prepayment discharge.<br>
As it was mentioned before, when the microcontroller confirms that the radio<br>
frequency is turned on, the microcon' roller will emit a radiofrequency command through<br>
the antenna 14 executing a function of a,search call for cards 15 (block 220) in<br>
accordance with the standard ISO 1A 443-3A. After the search call for the cards of block<br>
220 is done, the microcontroller 7 verifies if there is an intelligent card 15 in the<br>
detection field (block 230). If an intel igent card is inside the detection field in the block<br>
230, an anti-collision is done'(block 240) to determine if there is more than one<br>
intelligent card in -the detection field (in case there is more than orie intelligent card 15,<br>
one will be disabled according to the ISO 14443-3A norm). If there is no intelligent<br>
card 15 inside the detection field in ihis block 230, the microcontroller 7 returns to the<br>
inactive state to!save the maximum of energy while is waiting for a interruption<br>
command (block 80) and restarts the routine described in the blocks 90 to 180.<br>
Once a card is detected inside the field, the system selects the card<br>
(block 250) in accordance with the data transmission protocol by radiofrequency (for<br>
example, the specified in the standard ISO 14443-3A, and even: the specified by the<br>
standard ISO 14443-4A). After selecling the card in the block 250,'the microcontroller 7<br>
authenticates the card by the digital signature of discharge of thte amount of prepaid<br>
 <br>
kWh and with the serial number of the meter (block 260). The microcontroller then<br>
verifies if the intelligent card corresponds to the meter (block 270), if the card doesn't<br>
correspond to this meter the microcontroller 7 returns to the inactive state to save the<br>
maximum of energy while is waiting or a interruption command (block 80) and restarts<br>
the routine described in the blocks 90 to 180. However, if the card corresponds to this<br>
meter then it will read the balance of the card (block 280), At this point, the<br>
microcontroller 7 verifies if the prepayment intelligent card has credit (block 290), if the<br>
determination in the block 290 is negative the microcontroller 7 returns to the inactive<br>
state to save the maximum of energy while is waiting for a interruption command (block<br>
80) and restarts the routine described in the blocks 90 to 180. If the result of verifying<br>
the block 290 is determined affirmative, then the microcontroller will aloud the credit<br>
discharge of the intelligent card 15 ir the Flash memory of the microcontroller 11 of the<br>
energy measurement card 9 by the contactless prepayment control card (block 300). It<br>
could occur that not all the prepayment credit is discharged in a single discharge, since<br>
the credit to be discharged depends on the amount stored in the card in the variable<br>
"Quantity of prepaid kWh to be transferred by discharge". Right after discharging the<br>
credit in the block 300, the system reads the remaining credit in the meter (block 310)<br>
and adds the discharged credit from card 15: to the remaining credit in the meter (block<br>
320). The new prepaid credit value that results in the operation done in the block 320 is<br>
sent to the Flash memory of the energy meter (block 330) by microcontroller 11. After<br>
receiving the new credit value or. at he same time, the microcontroller 11 sends to the<br>
intelligent card 15 (block 340) the information generated in the measurement module<br>
10 regarding the .energy consumed by the user during the life of ithe meter and meter<br>
tampering (for example, such as. disconnections, inversions, presence of derivations,<br>
etc.). After sending the information to the; intelligent card 15, the microcontroller 7<br>
returns to the inactive state to save the maximum of energy while is waiting for a<br>
interruption command (block 80) to restart the routine described in the blocks 90 to<br>
 <br>
180.<br>

realization of the present invention, it will be obvious for whom:have knowledge in this<br>
matter that could be done other diverse changes and modifications without being apart<br>
of the spirit and ;the scope of the invention. Therefore, is sought to protect in the<br>
