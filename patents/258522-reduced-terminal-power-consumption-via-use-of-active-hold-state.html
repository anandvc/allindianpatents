				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>An access terminal (AT) in a cellular communication system is configured to operate in an active hold (AH) state, a transitional state between traffic and dormant states. The AT applies power to its transmit chain with a low duty cycle while in the AH state, conserving battery power. To improve robustness of the communications, the radio network may power control the AT to a higher level relative to the power control level of the AT in the traffic state. Transition from the traffic state to the AH state may be initiated after a brief period of inactivity on the reverse link. The AT may remain in the AH state while receiving forward link payload data. Transmission of a reverse link payload packet in the AH state may initiate transition to the traffic state. A prolonged period of inactivity may initiate a transition from the AH state to the dormant state.</td>

WO 2007/098481	2	PCT/US2007/062524<br>
REDUCED TERMINAL POWER CONSUMPTION VIA USE OF<br>
ACTIVE HOLD STATE<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial Number 60/775,443, entitled "Wireless Communication System and Method?" filed on February 21, 2006; the present Application for Patent also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 60/775,693, entitled "DO Communication System and Method," filed on February 21, 2006. Each of these Provisional Patent Applications is assigned to the assignee of the present Application and is expressly incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including all figures, tables, and claims.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002]	The  present  invention  relates  generally to telecommunications,  and,  more<br>
specifically, the invention relates to wireless communication systems and cellular communication systems.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	A   modern   communication   system   is   expected   to   provide   reliable   data<br>
transmission for a variety of applications, such as voice and data applications. In a point-to-multipoint communications context, known communication systems are based on frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and perhaps other multiple access communication schemes.<br>
(0004]	A CDMA system may be designed to support one or more CDMA standards,<br>
such as (1) the "TIA/EIA-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" (this standard with its enhanced revisions A and B may be referred to as the "IS-95 standard"), (2) the "TIA/EIA-98-C Recommended Minimum Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Mobile Station" (the "IS-98 standard"), (3) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP) and embodied in a set<br><br>
WO 2(107/098481	3	PCT/US2007/062524<br>
of documents known as the "W-CDMA standard." (4) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2) and embodied in a set of documents including "TR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," the "C.S0005-A Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," and the "TIA/EIA/IS-856 cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification" (the "cdma2000 standard" collectively), (5) the lxEV-DO standard, and (6) certain other standards. The standards expressly listed above are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including annexes, appendices, and other attachments.<br>
[0005]	Data-only and data-optimized or "DO" cellular communication systems have<br>
been developed to satisfy the constantly increasing demand for wireless data services. As the name implies, DO systems are optimized for data transmission (as opposed to voice transmission), and in particular such systems are optimized for downlink data transmission. Data-optimized systems need not exclude uplink data transmission, or voice transmission in either direction. It should be noted that voice may be transmitted as data, for example, in the case of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) transmissions.<br>
(0006]	In wireless networks, an access terminal configured for communication may be<br>
in a traffic state/mode or in a dormant state/mode. In the traffic state, air link resources for communication between the access terminal and the radio network are allocated at the radio network and powered on at the access terminal. Air link resources at the access terminal may include, for example, finger resources and channel elements. In the dormant state, the traffic channel is torn down, and air link resources are powered off at the access terminal. Power required for operating these resources is consequently not spent during the dormant state, and battery life at the access terminal is extended. Other subsystems of the access terminal may also be powered off or put into a power saving mode for most of the time during the dormant state; the access terminal then wakes up every so often to listen to the paging channel of the wireless system, in order to respond to the incoming pages or communication requests. The duty cycle of such periodic paging channel checks is low, to reduce the stand-by power consumption.<br>
[0007|	For a given battery capacity, power consumption determines the amount of time<br>
that the access terminal can operate without recharging. Conversely, for a specified operating time between recharging the battery, average power consumption determines<br><br>
WO 2007/098481	4	PCT/US2007/(I62524<br>
the required battery capacity and, consequently, the size, weight, and cost of the battery. Reducing power consumption of an access terminal is thus quite important.<br>
[(11081	Because  transmissions  from  a  given   access  terminal   are  interference   for<br>
transmissions from other access terminals, it is also desirable to reduce the duration and/or power levels of such transmissions.<br>
[0009]	Therefore, there is a need in the art for methods and apparatus that would reduce<br>
power consumption and interference of access terminals. There is also a need in the art for methods and apparatus for reducing power consumption and interference of the access terminals without excessively compromising performance characteristics of the access terminals and of the radio networks with which the terminals communicate. There is a further need for methods of upgrading previously-deployed networks to provide for reduced access terminal power consumption and interference, while at the same time maintaining backward compatibility with legacy access terminals, and minimizing or eliminating hardware changes to the radio network.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0010]	Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing<br>
methods, apparatus, and machine-readable articles of manufacture for implementing an active hold state in a wireless access terminal, and for communicating with the wireless access terminal.<br>

The word "traffic" generally refers to payload or user traffic, such as data other than air interface control and pilots.<br>
|00271	An access terminal, also referred to as AT, subscriber station, user equipment,<br>
UE, mobile terminal, or MT, may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more base transceiver stations. An access terminal may be any of a number of types of devices, including but not limited to PC card, external or internal modem, wireless telephone, and personal digital assistant (PDA) with wireless communication capability. An access terminal transmits and receives data packets to or from a radio network controller through one or more base transceiver stations.<br>
|00281	Base transceiver stations and base station controllers are parts of a network<br>
called radio network, RN, access network, and AN. Radio network may be a UTRAN or UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network. The radio network may transport data packets between multiple access terminals. The radio network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio network, such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, a conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN), or another radio<br><br>
WO 2007/098481	10	PCT/US2007/062524<br>
network, and may transport data and voice packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. Depending on conventions and on the specific implementation variants, a base transceiver station may be referred to by other names, such as Nodc-B, base station system (BSS). or simply base station. Similarly, a base station controller may be referred to by other names, such as radio network controller, RNC, controller, mobile switching center, or serving GPRS support node.<br>
[0029]	The scope of the invention extends to these and similar wireless communication<br>
system components.<br>
10030]	FIG. 1 illustrates selected components of a communication network 100, which<br>
includes a radio network controller 110 coupled to wireless base transceiver stations 120A, 120B, and 120C. The base transceiver stations 120 communicate with access terminals 130A, 130B, 130C, and 130D through corresponding wireless connections 140A through 140E. Each of the wireless connections 140 represents both a forward link (from the BTS to the AT, also known as downlink) and a reverse link (from the AT to the BTS, also known as uplink). The radio network controller 110 is coupled to a public switched telephone network 150 through a telephone switch 160, and to a packet switched network 170 through a packet data server node (PDSN) 180. Data interchange between various network elements, such as the radio network controller 110 and the packet data server node 180, can be implemented using any number of protocols, for example, the Internet Protocol (IP), an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocol, Tl, El, frame relay, and other protocols.<br>
100311	The radio network controller 110 and the base transceiver stations 120 may be<br>
part of a data-optimized radio network, such as a IxEV-DO network. In the illustrated embodiment, the radio network provides both data communication services and cellular telephone services to the access terminals 130. In alternative embodiments, the radio network may provide only data services (including VoIP and similar packetized data-based voice communications), or only voice services.<br>
(00321	Multiple or even all the access terminals 130 may be in the same cell or site, or<br>
each access terminal 130 may be in a separate cell or site.<br>
[0033]	A typical access terminal, for example, the access terminal  130A, includes<br>
receiver circuitry 131, transmitter circuitry 132, encoder 133, decoder 134, equalizer 135, processor 136, and memory device 137. The receiver, transmitter, encoder, decoder, and equalizer are configured by the processor executing program code stored<br><br>
WO 2007/098481	11	PCT/US2007/062524<br>
in the memory device. Each access terminal 130 is configured to communicate data using at least one transmission protocol, such as the wireless packet transmission protocols described in the specifications mentioned above. The access terminals 130 communicate with the base transceiver stations 120 via communication channels 140A through 140E, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
J00341	Each of the base transceiver stations 120 includes one or more wireless receivers<br>
(e.g., receiver 121 of the BTS 120A), one or more wireless transmitters {e.g., transmitter 122 of the BTS 120A), radio network controller interface {e.g., interface 123), a memory {e.g., memory 124), a processor {e.g., processor 125), and encoder/decoder circuitry {e.g., encoder/decoder circuitry 126). A receiver/transmitter pair and other components of each base transceiver station are configured by the station's processor operating under control of the program code stored in the BTS's memory, to establish forward and reverse links with the access terminals 130 in order to send packets to and receive packets from the access terminals 130. In the case of data services, for example, the base transceiver stations 120 may receive forward link data packets from the packet switched network 170 through the packet data server node 180 and through the radio network controller 110, and transmit these packets to the access terminals 130. The base transceiver stations 120 may receive reverse link data packets that originate at the access terminals 130, and forward these packets to the packet switched network 170 through the radio network controller 110 and the packet data server node 180. In the case of telephone (voice) services, the base transceiver stations 120 may receive forward link data packets from the telephone network 150 through the telephone switch 160 and through the radio network controller 110, and transmit these packets to the access terminals 130.

|0037|	The network 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 includes one public switched telephone<br>
network, one packet switched network, one base station controller, three base transceiver stations, and four access terminals. A person skilled in the art would recognize, after perusal of this document, that alternative embodiments in accordance with aspects of the invention need not be limited to any particular number of these components. For example, a lesser or a greater number of base transceiver stations and access terminals may be included in some embodiments. Furthermore, the communication network 100 may connect the access terminals 130 to one or more additional communication networks, for example, a second wireless communication network having a number of wireless access terminals.<br>
[0038]	As has already been mentioned, a known  access terminal  configured  for<br>
communication may be in a dormant or traffic state, depending on the status of the network traffic between such known access terminal and the radio network. The traffic state corresponds to traffic activity between the radio network and the mobile terminal. For example, an access terminal may transition from dormant to traffic state in response to a voice call or data communication. The voice call or the data communication may be incoming (to the access terminal) or outgoing (from the access terminal). Conversely, the access terminal may transition from the traffic state to the dormant state when traffic activity ceases for some predetermined period of time. Typically, the radio network controls the transitions between the two states.<br>
10039]	Traffic activity may be quite asymmetrical between the radio network and the<br>
access terminal. In other words, considerably more traffic may be communicated in one direction than in the opposite direction. This is particularly so for data communication, when downlink traffic flow typically exceeds uplink traffic flow by a large margin. For example, a user at an access terminal may be downloading a large file for a relatively long period of time, with mostly control information being communicated uplink. The control information may be from various layers, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) acknowledgements, and power control, rate control, and pilot of the physical air link. Similarly, a VoIP conversation may be one-sided, with the user at the access terminal mostly listening or holding the line for long stretches of the time. During such time periods, uplink resources of the access terminal continue to be powered on and consequently consuming power, although they are not needed to carry user (payload) data from the access terminal to the radio network.<br><br>
13<br>
|0040)	In an embodiment, an access terminal  130 (e.g., the access terminal  130A)<br>
communicates with a base transceiver station {e.g., BTS 120A) of a radio network. The<br>
radio network may be, for example, a data-optimized radio network such as IxEV-DO<br>
network, a data-only network, or a voice-only network. The access terminal is<br>
configured to be in one of three states while connected to the radio network: (1) traffic<br>
state, (2) dormant state, and (3) active hold (AH) state. The first two states are similar<br>
or identical to the conventional traffic and dormant states of an access terminal,<br>
respectively. The active hold state is a transitional intermediate state between the<br>
dormant and traffic states. This state allows additional reduction in the power<br>
consumption of the access terminal, particularly during prolonged periods of reverse<br>
link traffic inactivity that coincide with forward link traffic activity of the access<br>
terminal.<br>
(0041)	In the active hold state, certain air link resources are used with a low duty cycle<br>
by the access terminal. For example, channel elements, fmger resources, and other<br>
transmit chain components may be powered down (off) on the reverse link side of the<br>
access terminal for a substantial percentage of the time. For example, the duty cycle of<br>
the transmit chain may be less than fifty percent, less than twenty-five percent, or less<br>
than five percent. In some variants, the access network (e.g., BTS) does not deallocate,<br>
deassign, or power off channel elements and finger resources from serving the access<br>
terminal in the active hold state. Moreover, in some variants the radio network does not<br>
deallocate any resources from the access terminal in this state.<br>
[0042]	FIG. 2 is a state diagram showing transitions between the traffic state 210,<br>
dormant state 220, and active hold state 230. In the traffic state 210, the access terminal 130 is actively communicating with the base transceiver station 120. A transition 213 from the traffic state 210 to the active hold state 230 takes place in response to a brief period of traffic inactivity. (It should be noted that the references to activity and inactivity that cause or initiate the transitions between the traffic, dormant, and active hold'states are references to payload traffic activity or inactivity, respectively.) The transition 213 may take place after a period of reverse link inactivity, and/or after a period of both reverse and forward link inactivity. In some embodiments, the transition 213 is initiated after expiration of a reverse link AH (active hold) inactivity timer, or after expiration of a reverse link AH inactivity timer and a forward link AH inactivity timer. (The two timers may be set to.expire after the same or different time periods.)<br><br>
WO 2007/098481<br><br>
14<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062524<br><br>
[00431	A transition 231 from the active hold state 230 to the traffic stale 210 is initialed<br>
when traffic activity between the access terminal and the radio network renews. For example, reverse link traffic will initiate the transition 231. In variants where the access terminal enters the active hold state 230 due to brief inactivity on both reverse and forward links (rather than on the reverse link alone), renewed forward link activity may also initiate the transition 231.<br>
[0044]	A transition 232 from the active hold state 230 to the dormant state 220 is<br>
initiated in response to another period of traffic inactivity while in the active hold state 230. The transition 232 may take place after a period of inactivity on both the reverse and the forward links. In some embodiments, the transition 232 is initiated after expiration of a reverse link dormant inactivity timer and after expiration of a forward link dormant inactivity timer. As in the case of the transition 213, the two timers may be set to expire after the same or different time periods. The transition 232 is therefore initiated after some period of inactivity on both the reverse and the forward links.<br>
[0045]	A transition 221 from the dormant state 220 to the traffic state 210 is initiated in<br>
response to presence of reverse link traffic. In some embodiments, the transition 221 may be initiated in response to any traffic (payload) between the access terminal and the base transceiver station. In some embodiments, however, a transition 223 from the dormant state 220 to the active hold state 230 is initiated in response to solely forward link traffic, while the transition 221 is initiated whenever reverse link traffic appears.<br>
10046]	The transitions between the different states shown in FIG. 2 may be initiated by<br>
the access terminal, for example, by sending an otherwise unused (spare) codeword on the reverse rate indicator (RRI) channel. The use of a spare RRI codeword is advantageous because it is unlikely to be mistaken for anything else at the radio network. The radio network (the radio network controller 110, for example) then decides whether to grant the transition requested. The grant may be sent to the access terminal on one of the forward link control channels, for example on the acknowledge (ACK) channel. In effect, the ACK in response to the RRI indicates that the radio network also transitioned the access terminal to the active hold state. Alternatively or additionally, the radio network may initiate some of the transitions, by sending an appropriate control message to the access terminal. In specific variants, the transitions are initiated as follows:<br><br>
WO 2007/098481	15	PCT/US2007/062524<br>
100471	■     The transition 213 from the traffic state 210 to the active hold state 230 -<br>
Initiated by the access terminal through the RRI channel using a special RRI codeword, and granted by the access network through the ACK channel;<br>
10048]	■     The transition 232 from the active hold state 230 to the dormant state 220 -<br>
Initiated by either the access terminal or the radio network after prolonged inactivity (at least 2 seconds) of both reverse and forward link traffic;<br>
[0049]	•    The transition 231 from the active hold state 230 to the traffic state 210 -<br>
Initiated by the access terminal due to a reverse link packet and granted by the radio network. The special RRI codeword may be used to transition to the active hold state (access terminal may use this to indicate to the radio network that it is attempting to enter the active hold state), and the ACK channel in response to the special RRT codeword may be the radio network indicating to the access terminal that the access terminal is now in the active hold state.<br>
[0050]	Jt should be noted that the ACK channel messages may remain the same as in<br>
existing systems, but the interpretation of these messages may change when the access terminal is in the active hold state. For example, when the access terminal in the active hold state sends a reverse link packet, the acknowledgement of the packet by the radio network on the ACK channel also serves to take the access terminal from the active hold state to the traffic state.<br>
[0051]	Let us now turn to the operation in the active hold state, e.g., the state 230. As<br>
has already been discussed, in some variants the access terminal (e.g., the terminal 130A) can be in this state while receiving forward link payload traffic. In these variants, the access terminal can power down the transmit chain elements for most of the time, turning the transmit chain back on when providing downlink feedback information. Because of the low duty cycle of the transmit chain being powered on while in the active hold state, as compared to the traffic state, significant power savings may be achieved. In some specific variants, the access terminal powers on its transmit chain to provide feedback (e.g., power control, data rate control, reverse link pilot, data source control) to the radio network once every 8 slots, corresponding to about 75 Hertz update rate; in other specific variants, the access terminal powers on its transmit chain once every 16 slots, corresponding to the update rate of about 37.5 Hertz. These update rates are two and four times slower, respectively, than the 150 Hertz update rate (once in every 4 slots in IxEV-DO revision B) used in the traffic state. It should be noted that<br><br>
WO 2007/098481	16	PCT/US2007/062524<br>
the invention is not limited to the particular update rates, or to the particular ratios<br>
between the active hold and traffic state update rates.<br>
(0052]	Providing feedback information at a slower rate may make communications<br>
between the access terminal and the radio network less robust, particularly in dynamic environments with fast changing physical propagation paths. For example, the physical propagation path between the access terminal and the base transceiver station may deteriorate (fade) faster than the radio network can compensate for by increasing the power control set point of the access terminal. To counteract this potential problem, in some variants the radio network increases the power control set point of the access terminal in the active hold state, relative to the power control set point in the traffic state with the same signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR). In some specific variants, the power control set point maybe increased by approximately ldB, 2dB, 3dB, or4dB. The increase in the power control set point and the decrease in the update rate may depend on each other and be varible. For example, the power control set point may to increased by 2dB (over the corresponding set point in traffic state given the same SINR) every time the update rate is halved (also relative to the corresponding rate in the traffic state). Furthermore, in some variants, the radio network increases the set point only up to a certain power limit. The power limit may be such that the increase of power beyond the limit would begin to affect power consumption of the access terminal. In many access terminals, the total power consumption is essentially the same (within 0.1 mW, for example) regardless of the actual transmit power, up until the transmit power reaches the power limit. Therefore, there is little penalty from the power consumption perspective in increasing the power control set point, as long as the transmit power does not exceed the aforementioned power limit. The power limit may be approximately 0 dBm, 5 dBm, or 10 dBm. These are of course exemplary values, and the actual power limit may differ.<br>
10053|	TIG. 3 is a simplified overview of operation of certain variants in the active hold<br>
state.<br>
10054]	FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary process 400 performed by an access terminal in<br>
the active hold state. At flow point 401, the access terminal has entered the active hold state due to some period of inactivity on the reverse link (during which period no payload data had been transmitted from the access terminal to the base transceiver station serving the access terminal).   At step 405, the access terminal decreases the<br><br>
WO 2007/098481	17	PCT/US2O07/0fi2524<br>
frequency of providing feedback updates to the base transceiver station. The base transceiver station may concurrently increase the power control set point of the access terminal.<br>
|0055]	At decision block 410, the access terminal determines if traffic (payload) activity<br>
has renewed on the reverse link. If there is renewed traffic activity on the reverse link, a transition to the traffic state is initiated at step 415, and the process 400 ends at flow point 499.<br>
100561	If there is no renewed traffic activity on the reverse link, process flow continues<br>
to decision block 420, in which the access terminal determines whether the elapsed time since last traffic is greater than some limit. The limit may be predetermined. If the elapsed time does not exceed the limit, as may be the case when the base transceiver station continues to transmit forward link traffic, process flow returns to decision block 410.<br>
[00570]	If the elapsed time exceeds the limit, a transition to me dormant state is initiated<br>
in step 425, and the process 400 ends at flow point 499.<br>
