				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
FIELD OF THE ART<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to an wig and more particularly to a disposable wig.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE ART<br>
[0002]	A wig has been manufactured by handwork and, therefore, is expensive. There<br>
has been no concept that a wig is used once or only several times and thrown away.<br>
[0003]	The wig has been manufactured by handwork in such a manner that a hair<br>
segment to be implanted is folded in two, which is one by one implanted by hand onto a thick<br>
base formed into a three-dimensional shape, for example. When one folded hair segment is<br>
implanted, it looks as if two hairs are implanted. In another operation, a bundle of several<br>
folded hair segments have been implanted at one time.<br>
[0004]	A disposable wig has first been proposed by the present inventor, one example<br>
of which is disclosed in the following patent document 1.<br>
[0005]	Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application No. 1999-264131<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	Such a prior art handwork hair-implantation is extremely inefficient, because it<br>
would take about three weeks to implant 20,000 hair segments, for example, to the utmost. In<br>
addition, when a wig is manufactured in foreign countries in order to save labor costs, it tends to<br>
increase inferior products and reduce a yield of production.<br>
[0007]	The inventors have made some attempts to form an adhesive layer on the<br>
underside of the base by coating and spraying methods, but they have ended in failure because<br>
the adhesive layer formed by such methods would be too thick or have uneven surface.<br>
[0008]	If the base, including the adhesive layer formed on the underside of the base,<br>
should not be formed as a thin skin, it provides a remarkable level difference when it is fitted<br>
onto a human skin. It looks really like a wig and sould easily be recognized as artificial hair.<br>
[0009]	Further, if the surface of the adhesive layer is not even, the fitting surface of the<br>
wig tends to wrinkle, resulting in unnatural appearance.<br>
[0040]	Still further, If the surface of the adhesive layer is not even, the adhesive strength<br><br>
would not be uniform, so that it becomes easier to be partially peeled off.<br>
[0011]	The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the above-described<br>
problems and more specifically to provide a wig that is hardly recognized as artificial hair and<br>
can be thrown away after it has been deteriorated with time.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0012]	To achieve the above objects, a disposable wig according to the present<br>
invention comprises a base formed of an extremely thin sheet, hair segments implanted onto<br>
the base and an adhesive layer formed on the underside of the base, characterized in that the<br>
thickness of the base is of the order of microns(µ), the adhesive layer is formed on the entire<br>
underside of the base with a uniform thickness, having projected portions and remaining<br>
portions, the projected portions engaging the root portions of the implanted hair segments<br>
protruding from the underside of the base, and the projected portions are raised toward the<br>
surface side of the base when the wig is fitted onto a human skin.<br>
The disposable wig defined in claim 1 may further be characterized in that the thickness<br>
of the adhesive layer is in a range of up to about 20 times greater than the thickness of the<br>
base.<br>
The disposable wig defined in claim 1 may further be characterized in that the projected<br>
portions of the adhesive layer have height of 80 microns.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]	When the wig is fitted onto a substantially flat surface of a human skin<br>
(such as scalp), the projected portions at the underside of the base become<br>
substantially flat because the entire underside of the base is in planar contact with the<br>
flat surface of the scalp, so that the projected portions will now appear at the top<br>
surface of the base. Accordingly, at the base surface, the projected portions that<br>
engage the root portions of the implanted hair segments are raised when compared<br>
with the remaining (recessed) portions.<br>
[0014]	When the entire top surface of the base becomes so rugged with the<br>
projected portions and the remaining portions, light that hits the base is irregularly<br>
reflected so that the base will not glisten and the wig is hard to be distinguished from<br>
true hair.<br><br>
[0015]	In addition, due to a reversal phenomenon of the rugged underside<br>
of the base (that is a phenomenon wherein the underside of the base having the<br>
downward projected portions becomes flat and the top surface of the base becomes<br>
rugged with upward projected portions), the root portions of the implanted hair segments<br>
are urged by the scalp, through the thin adhesive layer, toward the surface side of the<br>
base, thereby reinforcing the fixing of the implanted hair segments and prevent the<br>
implanted hair segments from being removed from the base.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0016]	[Fig.1] is a perspective view showing a disposable wig according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[Fig. 2] is an enlarged view taken along ll-ll line in Fig. 1.<br>
[Fig. 3] is a view showing a disposable wig according to the present<br>
invention when it is fitted onto a human scalp.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF INVENTION<br>
[0017]	Next, a disposable wig according to the present invention will be<br>
described in more detail with reference to those drawings. For the sake of convenience,<br>
parts having the same function are indicated by the same reference numerals and<br>
explanation thereof will be omitted. Reference numeral 1 indicates a base that is<br>
formed of an extremely thin sheet having thickness substantially equal to that of a<br>
human skin (for example, 30 microns). The base 1 is made from elastic, colorless,<br>
transparent material such as polyurethane. and formed as substantially a flat sheet.<br>
Reference numerals 3 indicate hair segments 3 implanted onto the bases tnat are made<br>
from polyester fiber. The hair segments 3 are implanted by V-implanting method, for<br>
example. Reference numeral 4 indicates adhesive that is applied in a dotty pattern to a<br>
root portion 5 of each hair segment 3 by using a pin, not shown, when the hair segment<br>
3 is implanted, so as to secure the root portion 5 to the underside of the base 1. This<br>
reinforces the fitting of the implanted hair segment 3 onto the base 1 and supports the<br>
upstanding condition of the hair segment 3. The root portion 5 of the implanted hair<br>
segment 3 is projected from the underside of the base 1. Reference numerals 6<br>
indicate free ends of the implanted hair segment 3. Reference numeral 7 indicates an<br>
adhesive layer that is formed on the entire underside of the base 1 with a uniform<br><br>
thickness. The thickness B of the adhesive layer 7 is formed in such a manner that there is a<br>
rugged underside with projected portions 9 that engage the root portions 5 and the remaining<br>
portions (recessed portions 11).<br>
[0018]	The adhesive layer 7 is formed by a transfer process from acryl-based<br>
adhesive. More particularly, an acryl-based adhesive sheet with release papers 15,<br>
17 at opposite sides thereof is prepared and one 15 of the release papers (PET) is<br>
removed so that the exposed surface of the adhesive is adhered to the entire<br>
underside of the base 1. For use, the other release paper 17 is removed so that the<br>
base is fitted onto a desired portion of the scalp or other human body.<br>
[0019]	Table 1 shows examples of the thickness B of the adhesive layer 7, ratios<br>
between them and the thickness A of the base 1 (B/A ratios), examples of the heights<br>
C of the projected portions 9 from the surface of the recessed portions 11 and ratios<br>
between them and the thickness A of the base 1 (C/A ratios). The actual numerical<br>
values have been rounded to two decimal places and the resulting rounded values are<br>
shown in Table 1<br><br>
[0021]	The B/A ratios are proportional to the thickness B of the adhesive layer 7<br>
because the thickness A of the base 1 is constant, but all examples have the constant<br>
C/A ratio because the adhesive layer 7 has the uniform thickness B and the constant<br>
height C. This provides the following results.<br>
[0022]	First, when the wig is fitted onto a human skin (such as the scalp 13), the<br>
rugged underside of the base becomes into press-contact with the scalp 13 so that the<br>
projected portions 9 now appear at the surface side of the base, as shown in Fig. 3.<br><br>
[0023]	Accordingly, at the surface of the base 1, the projected portions 9 that<br>
engage the root portions 5 of the implanted hair segments 3 are raised when<br>
compared with the recessed portions 11. This is called a reversal phenomenon of the<br>
unevenness (that is a phenomenon wherein the projected portions originally directing<br>
downward becomes one directing upward). This is caused by the fact that the base 1<br>
and the adhesive layer 7 are both formed to have extremely thin, but uniform thickness.<br>
The projected portions 9 that become raised are shown by reference numerals 9A.<br>
[0024]	When the entire surface of the base 1 becomes so rugged with the<br>
projected portions and the remaining portions, light (shown by an arrow) that hits the<br>
base 1 is irregularly reflected so that the base 1 will not glisten and the wig is hard to<br>
be distinguished from true hair.<br>
[0025]	Due to the above-described reversal phenomenon of the projected<br>
portions which can be seen when the wig is fitted onto the human body, as shown by<br>
the arrows F, the implanted hair segments 3 become into press-contact with the scalp<br>
13, through the thin adhesive layer 7, toward the surface side of the base 1, thereby<br>
reinforcing the fixing of the implanted hair segments 3 and prevent the implanted hair<br>
segments 3 from being removed or epilated from the base 1.<br>
[0026]	As shown in Fig. 3, the portions (the recessed portions 11) at which no<br>
hair segments 3 are implanted are well transparent because the base 1 and the<br>
adhesive layer 7 are both extremely thin, so that the scalp 13 beneath these portions<br>
11 can be seen therethrough. This will also contribute to the fact that the wig is hard<br>
to be distinguished from true hair.<br>
[0027]	The adhesive layer is formed by the transfer process and has constant<br>
C/A ratio, so that the adhesive layer having uniform but extremely thin thickness may<br>
be mechanically and industrially produced.<br>
[0028]	The base 1 formed of elastic material shrinks after the wig is fitted onto<br>
the human body, so that there is an advantage that the portions of hair-implantation<br>
becomes inconspicuous.<br>
[0029]	Once integrally fitted on the human skin, anyone wearing the wig is free<br>
to scratch the head, brush, shampoo while wigged, swim, etc. without no anxiety for<br><br>
displacement of the wig. Moreover, the wig may be tightly fitted with no clearance or<br>
gap between the wig and the skin, so that it has improved compatibility to natural hair<br>
and any one holds no strange feelings when touching the wig. In addition, because<br>
there is no gap between the wig and the skin, no sound may be heard when tapping<br>
the wig. Therefore, the user will be free from any uneasy and stress.<br>
[0030]	In comparison with the conventional wig that is placed onto the head and<br>
connected with the own hair, the wig according to the present invention is in direct<br>
contact with the skin and, therefore, is applicable to any desired skin area even if such<br>
has no own hair, including private parts of atrichosis. In addition, there is no load to<br>
the own hair.<br>
[0031]	The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment.<br>
For example, it should be understood that numerical values designating the thickness<br>
of the base 1, the thickness of the adhesive layer 7 and the height of the projected<br>
portions 9 in the above-described embodiment are only examples and may be<br>
changed without departing the gist of the present invention. For example, the<br>
thickness A of the base 1, the thickness B of the adhesive layer 7 and the height C of<br>
the projected portions 9 may be changed as shown in Table 2.<br><br>
[0033]	Variations of B/A ratios shown in Table 1 or Table 2 may be selectively<br>
used depending upon the skin area and condition to which the wig or the adhesive<br>
sheet with the implanted artificial hair according to the present invention is applied.<br>
For example, when applied to a sudoresis or a skin area of greater sebum secretion, a wig<br>
having a greater B/A ratio is preferred, because the adhesive layer 7 absorbs sweat and sebum.<br><br>
When applied to a skin area at which own hair is to be grown, a wig having a smaller B/A ratio is<br>
used to prevent interruption of growth of the own hair.<br>
[0034]	The tensile strength of the base 1 increases with its thickness, whereas<br>
its compatibility to skin increases as it becomes thin. Accordingly, when applied to a<br>
skin area such as eyebrow and mustache, for example, that requires the compatibility<br>
rather than the tensile strength, a wing having a thin base 1 is preferred.<br>
[0035]	How to implant the hair segments is optional.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0036]	The present invention may be used as a wig or an adhesive sheet with<br>
implanted artificial hair of a completely novel type.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A disposable wig comprising a base formed of an extremely thin sheet, hair<br>
segments implanted onto the base and an adhesive layer formed on the underside of<br>
the base, characterised in that the thickness of the base is of the order of microns (µ),<br>
the adhesive layer is uniformly formed on the entire underside of the base with such a<br>
thickness that there is a little unevenness with projected portions and remaining<br>
portions, the projected portions engaging the root portions of the implanted hair<br>
segments protruding from the underside of the base, the projected portions are raised<br>
toward the surface side of the base when the wig is fitted onto a human skin, and the<br>
thickness of the adhesive layer is in a range of up to about 20 times greater than the<br>
thickness of the base.<br>
2.	The disposable wig as claimed in claim 1, wherein the adhesive layer has the<br>
unevenness of 80 microns.<br><br>
A disposable wig, comprising a base (1) formed of an extremely thin sheet, implanted hair materials (3) implanted<br>
in the base, and an adhesive layer (7) installed on the rear surface of the base. The thickness of the base is in unit of micron (µ ). The<br>
adhesive layer is formed on the entire rear surface of the base with such a uniform thickness that irregularities are formed between<br>
the projected parts (9) put over the root parts (5) of the implanted bair materials projected from the rear surface of the base and the<br>
other portions, and when the wig is fitted to the skin of a person, the projected parts are raised to the surface side of the base. When<br>
the wig is fitted onto a scalp (13), the irregularities on the rear surface of the base are pressed by the surface of the scalp and raised,<br>
and the projected parts pur over the root parts on the surface of the base are brought in a state that are raised from the other portions.<br>
Accordingly, light hitting the base is irregularly reflected, and the wig becomes hard to be distinguished from true hair. Since the<br>
implanted hair materials are brought in a state of being pressed by the scalp on the surface side of the base, the fixing of the implanted<br>
hair materials is reinforced and the implanted hair materials are prevented from being released (so-called the epilation).</td>
