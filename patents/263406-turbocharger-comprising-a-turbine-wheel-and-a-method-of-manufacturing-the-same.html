				<td>COMPRESSOR WHEEL ASSEMBLY<br>
This invention relates to the assembly of a compressor wheel to a rotating shaft In particuiar, the invention relates to the compressor wheel assembly of a iurbocharger., .<br>
Turbochargers arc well known devices for suplting  air to the intake of an internal  combustion engine at pressures above atmospheric (boost pessures). A conventional turbocharger  essecntially corrrpriscs snexhaust gas driven turbine wheel mounted on a rotatabls shaft within  a turbine housing. Rotation of the turbine wheel rotates a compressor wheel  mounted on the other end of the shaft  within a ccnnpressor housing.The  compressor wheel delivers compressed air to the intake manifold of the migine, thereeby increasing engine power. The shaft is supported on journal and tbiiist bearing located within a coitral bearing housing connected between  the turbine and compressor  wheel housings. .<br>
A cnventional  compressor  wheel comprises an array of blades extending from s central hub provided -with  a here for receiving one end of the turbocharger shaft. The compressor wheel is secured to the  shaft by a nut which threads onto the end of the shaft where it extends through  the wheel bore, and bears against the nose end of the wheel to clamp the wheel gainst a shaft shoulder (or other radially extending abutment that rotates  with the shaft). Tt is important that the clamping force is sufficiently great to prevent slippage  of the wheel on the shaft which could threw the wheel out of balance. An unbalanced wheel will at at the  very least experience increased vibration, which could shorten the woiking life of the  wheel, and at worst could suffer catastrophic failure.<br>
Modem donands on turbocharger  performance require increased airflow from a turbocharger of a given size, leading to increased rotational speeds, for instance in excess of 100,000 ipm. To accommodate such high rotational  speeds the tuibochargcr bearings, and thus the tmbocharger shaft diameter, must be minimize. However, the use of a relatively small diameter shaft is probomatical with the conventional compressor wheel mounting assembly because the shaft must be able to withstatid the high clamping force required to prevent slippage of the wheel. Thus,<br><br>
the strength of the shaft, i.e. the clamping load it can withstand, may limit  the mass of compressor wheel that may be mounted to the shaft.<br>
The above problem is exacerbated  as continued  turbocharger development requires the use of higher  performance materials such as titanium which has a greater density than  the aluminium alloys conventionally  used. The increased inertia of such materials increasesthe slikelihod of compressor wheel slippage, particulariy as fte compressor wheel rapidly accelerates during transient operating conditions. The clamping force required from a convcntionsl compressor  wheel mounting assembly may well exceed that which the shaft can withstand.<br>
One possible way of avoiding the above problem is to use a so-called 'bore-less' compressor wheel such as disclosed in US patent number 4,705,463. With this compressor wheel assembly only a relatively short threaded bore is provided in the compressor wheel to receive the threaded end of a shortened tuibocharger shaft. However, such assemblies can also experience balancing problems as the threaded conection  between the compressor  wheel and the shaft, and the clearance inherent in such a connsotioa, tnay make it difficult to maintain the required degree of connectricity. <br>
It is 30 object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the above problems.<br>
Accordmg to a first  aspect of the present invention there is provided a turboscharger cmprising a turbine wheel mounted to a first end of a shaft for rotation withng a turbine  housing, and a compressor wheel mounted to a second end of the shaft for rotation within a compressor housing, the compressor wheel having an axial through bore extending  between a first end of the wheel and a second  end of the wheel, said second end being remote from said turbine, wherein the second end  of the shaft extends through  the bore and a short distance beyond the second end of the compressor wheel and a nut is threaded onto said second end of the shaft to apply  a clamping force to the compressor wheel either directly, or indirectly through an intcnnediate clamping monber disposal around said shaft adjaceut the second end of the compressor wheel, such that the second end of the  compressor wheel  has a radial sur&amp;ce contacting a radial surface of the nut or intermediate clarnping member, and<br>
wherein at least one of said radal surface is treated to increase its co-efficient  of friction with respect  to the other surface.<br>
Thepresent  invention thus increases the torque capacity of the clamping coupling without significant modification of the components of the compressor  wheel assembly. The sorface treatment may for instance simply increase the roughness  of the respective surface, for example hy laser etching an appropriate pattern into the suraface. .<br>
The preset invention also provides a method of increasing the torque capacity of an axial clamping assembly of a compressor wheel.<br>
Specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is an axial cross-section through  a conventional turbocharger  illustrating the major components of a turbnocharger  and a conventional compressor wheel assembly.<br>
The illustratedturbocharger  comprises a turbine 1 joined to a compressor 2 via a central bearing housing 3. The turbine  l comprises a turbine  housing 4 which houses a turbine -wheel  S. Similarly, thecompressor 2 comprises a compressor housing 6 which houses acompressor  wheel 7. The turbine wheel 5 and compressor wheel 7 are mounted on opposite ends  of a common shaft 8 which is supported  on bearing assemblies 9 within the besting housing 3.<br>
The turbine housing 4 is provided with an exhaust gas inlet 10 and an exhaust gas outlet 11. The inlet 10 directs incomnig exhaust gas to an annular inlet chamber 12 surrounding the turbine wheel 5. The exhaust gas flows through the turbine and into the outlet 11 via a circular outlet opening which is co-axial with the turbine wheel 5. Rotation of the turbine wheel 5 rotates the compressor wheel 7 which draws in air through axial inlet 13 and delivers compressed air to the ragine intake via an aimular outlet volute 14.<br>
Referring in more detail to the compressor wheel assembly, the compressor wheel comprises a piuraliiy of blades 15 extending from a central hub 16 which is provided with a through bore to receive one end of the  shaft 8. The shaft 8 extends slightly from  the nose of the compressor wheel 7 and is threaded to receive a nut 17 which bears against the compr^sor wheel nose to clamp the compressor wheel 7<br>
gainst a thrust bearing and oii seal assembly 18. Details of the thrust bearing/oil seal assembly may vary and are not important to understanding  of the compressor wheel mounting arrangement, Essentially, the compressor wheel 7 is prevented from slipping on the shaft 8 by the clamping force applied by the nut 16.<br>
Problems associated with the conventional compressor wheel assembly described above are discussed in the introduction to this specification.<br>
in accordance within the present invention the rotational  drive force transmitted to the compressor wheel I may be iJscreased without increasing the clamping force,  or significantly modifying the clamping components. This  is achieved by treating the clamping surface of components to increase the co-efficient  of diction therebetween.<br>
Referring to the convcntiooal clamping assembly of Figure 1, the radial surface of the nose portion of die conn»essor wheel 7, against which the nut 17 bears, may be treated to increase its co-efficient of friction with respect to the nut, for instance by increasing the surface roughness. For examine, a laser may be used to etch an an appropriate pattern into the surface to increase the surface roughness.  This has been found to increase the torque capacity of the clamping joint without compromising the component form tolerances.<br>
The contact surface of the nut may similarly be treated, in addition to or instead  of, the treatment of the compressor wheel surface, again to increase the coefficient of friction between the contacting  surfaces.<br>
In some clamping  arrangements  a washer or the like may be disposed between the nut  and the compressor wheel in which case the washer surface contacting the compressor  wheel may be treated to provide the increased co-efficient of friction.<br>
It may also be desirable to increase  the co-efficient of friction between tide back surface of the compressor wheel and the thrust bearing assembly, or other radial surface against which  the compressor wheel is clamped by the force supplied by the nut 16. With the iUustmed embodiment  descnbed above, this would involve treating either the back surface of the compressor wheel or the radial surfece of the thrust bearing assenihly. On other embodtments, , the shaft may be provided with an annular<br><br>
shoulder which bears against the bade surface  of the compressr  wheel and  which may similarly  be treated. .<br>
It will be appreciated that surface treatments other than laser etching may be employed to implement  the present invention, including mechanical and chemical treatments  to  increase the surface roughness of the respective materials. Appropriate  surface treatment methods will be readilyapparent to the skilled person <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
