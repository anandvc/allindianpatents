				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a beveling machine which makes a slanting surface on the<br>
edge of a member to be processed, and more particularly, to a beveling machine which is<br>
capable of easily controlling the extent of bevel, by minutely controlling the extent of<br>
bevel by a simple method of using a bevel-extent controlling unit which is one-touch<br>
operated, accurately maintaining the extent of bevel which is automatically controlled at<br>
the moment of unloosing the bevel-extent controlling unit which is held, and quickly and<br>
easily resetting a reference point of the extent of bevel which is changed after replacing a<br>
cutting tip.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, a beveling process is to chamfer a sharp edge portion of steel, nonferrous or<br>
resin materials. The beveling process is typically performed at a last processing process.<br>
Since the quality of a product depends on the quality of a beveled edge, special attention<br>
needs to be paid to the beveling process for obtaining the slanting surface which is clear<br>
and neat like a mirror by maximally improving the level of surface.<br>
For the beveling process, when a motor is driven by an electric power and a cutting tip is<br>
rotated by a driving force of the motor, a beveling machine processes the edge of a<br>
member to be processed.<br>
An example of a conventional bevel is illustrated in FIG. 10. The conventional bevel<br>
includes: a beveling body 1 in which a driving device such as a motor is positioned; a<br>
supporting holder 4 which is connected, by a screw, to a lower part of a direction changing<br>
unit 2, connected to one side of the beveling body 1, so as to be transferred up or down<br>
and is fixed by a fixing unit 3; a guide plate 6 which is positioned below the supporting<br>
holder 4 and guides a position to be beveled on a member to be processed, the guide plate<br>
6 including a cutter exposing opening 5 formed in the middle part thereof; and a rotary<br>
cutting unit 8 which is mounted onto a rotation shaft driven by the motor, allows a guide<br>
roller 7 to be exposed through the cutter exposing opening 5 and includes a cutting tip on a<br>
slope being in a cone shape.<br>
When the beveling machine is operated while the guide plate 6 is secured against a<br>
horizontal surface of the member to be processed and simultaneously the guide roller 7 is<br>
secured against an adjacent vertical surface of the member, the rotary cutting unit 8 rotates<br>
to shape a slanting surface.<br><br>
The extent of bevel by the beveling machine is determined according to the extent of<br>
exposure of the rotary cutting unit 8 to the outside through the cutter exposing opening 5<br>
on the guide plate 6. The more the rotary cutting unit 8 is exposed to the outside, the<br>
larger the slanting surface is processed.<br>
Disclosure<br>
Technical Problem<br>
However, to control the extent of bevel in the conventional beveling machine, the extent<br>
of exposure of the rotary cutting unit needs to be controlled by releasing the fixing state by<br>
the fixing unit and then rotating the supporting holder 4 being connected by the screw by<br>
eye measure. Thus, it is very difficult to control the extent of bevel and it takes a long<br>
time to perform a beveling process due to the control of the extent of bevel, thereby<br>
lowering the work efficiency. Moreover, when the extent of bevel according to kinds of<br>
members to be processed needs to be controlled every work, the extent of bevel is not<br>
uniform and the members are not precisely processed, thereby considerably deteriorating<br>
the quality of work.<br>
Moreover, the extent of bevel cannot be minutely controlled as a predetermined unit, and<br>
as the supporting holder is little by little loosened during the process, the preset extent of<br>
bevel cannot be accurately maintained.<br>
Moreover, after replacing the cutting tip by separating the supporting holder and when<br>
reassembling the supporting holder, it is very difficult to set an original reference point of<br>
the extent of bevel.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to solve the aforementioned problems<br>
caused by a conventional bevel and to provide a beveling machine in which the extent of<br>
bevel is minutely and accurately controlled by rotating a bevel-extent controlling unit by<br>
beveling graduations being divided into equal parts when the bevel-extent controlling unit<br>
is slidingly transferred and a rotation locking state is temporarily released, and in which<br>
the controlled extent of bevel is accurately maintained when the bevel-extent controlling<br>
unit is unloosed and a locking state is automatically set, thereby improving the quality of<br>
work.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a beveling machine which is used<br>
by selectively connecting to a conventional bevel basic frame or an air tool according to<br>
the kind of an adapter connected to an upper part of a cutting unit housing, thereby<br>
improving a wide use.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
A beveling machine according to the present invention has the effects of minutely and<br>
accurately controlling the extent of bevel as desired, by a simple method of transferring a<br>
bevel-extent controlling unit by sliding, temporarily releasing a locking state, and rotating<br>
the bevel-extent controlling unit to be set to a divided beveling graduation; and therefore,<br>
improving the quality of work and expanding the range of work by significantly<br>
shortening a time for controlling the extent of bevel and processing a member to be<br>
processed in more various sizes.<br>
Furthermore, since the bevel-extent controlling unit continuously maintains the locking<br>
state unless it is artificially operated, the extent of bevel being preset is accurately<br>
maintained, thereby consistently providing the quality of work with uniformity.<br>
Furthermore, the beveling machine is used by being selectively connected to a<br>
conventional beveling body or an air tool, according to the kind of an adapter connected to<br>
an upper end of the bevel-extent controlling unit, thereby improving the wide use thereof.<br>
Since a reference setting graduation is indicated in the bevel-extent controlling unit, an<br>
original reference point of the extent of bevel is accurately reset after replacing a cutting<br>
tip, thereby additionally providing the convenience in the use thereof.<br>

Best Mode<br>
To effectively achieve the aforementioned objects of the present invention, a beveling<br>
machine easily controlling the extent of bevel will be described with reference to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
The core technical constitution of the present invention is formed by interconnecting the<br>
constituents illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4. A beveling machine according to the present<br>
invention comprises: a cutting unit housing 10 including a fixed spline 12 formed on the<br>
upper outer surface thereof; an adapter 20 or 20a which is connected to the cutting unit<br>
housing 10 and selectively connected to a tool of supplying rotation power to a rotary<br>
cutting unit 8; a ruler 30 with graduations which is fitted between the adapter 20 or 20a<br>
and the cutting unit housing 10; a transfer guiding holder 40 which is connected to the<br>
cutting unit housing 10, transfers up or down, and includes a rotary spline 41 formed on<br>
the outer surface thereof; a supporting holder 50 which is connected to a lower part of the<br>
transfer guiding holder 40 by a screw; a bevel-extent controlling unit 60 which includes a<br>
rotary spline 61 formed on the inner surface thereof and controls and maintains the extent<br>
of bevel while being selectively transferred up or down, wherein the rotary spline 61 is<br>
connected to the rotary spline 41 of the transfer guiding holder 40 and the fixed spline 12<br>
of the cutting device housing 10; and an elastic member 70 which provides the bevel-<br>
extent controlling unit 60 with elasticity.<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
The cutting device housing 10 is formed in a multistage shape and has the diameter which<br>
becomes smaller progressively towards a lower part thereof. The rotary cutting unit 8 is<br>
rotatively positioned at a protruding part formed inside the cutting device housing 10 by a<br>
rotation supporting unit 11. The fixed spline 12 is positioned at the upper outer surface of<br>
the cutting device housing 10, to continuously and accurately maintain the preset extent of<br>
bevel and minutely and uniformly control the extent of bevel.<br>
The adapter 20 or 20a being connected to an upper part of the cutting unit housing 10 by a<br>
screw functions as an agent for the integration connection with each tool, such as a<br>
beveling body 1 or an air tool 9. That is, the adapter 20 or 20a transfers the rotation<br>
power generated in the beveling body 1 or the air tool 9 to the rotary cutting unit 8.<br>
To this end, when the adapter 20 is connected to the beveling body 1, a connection part 21<br>
positioned at a lower part of the adapter 20 is connected to the upper part of the cutting<br>
unit housing 10 by a screw, and a power shaft 23 with a spiral bevel gear 22 is rotatively<br>
positioned in the inner middle part of the adapter 20. A lower end of the power shaft 23 is<br><br>
connected to a rotation shaft 24, using a screw. The rotation shaft 24 is connected to the<br>
rotary cutting unit 8.<br>
Accordingly, as illustrated in FIG. 1, when a mounting plate 25 positioned on the adapter<br>
20 is connected to a direction changing unit 2 of the beveling body 1, the spiral bevel gear<br>
22 is engaged with another spiral bevel gear positioned on the motor shaft of the beveling<br>
body 1, the rotary cutting unit 8 is operated, using the rotation power of the beveling<br>
machine.<br>
Further, the use of the beveling machine according to the present invention is not limited<br>
to the conventional beveling body 1. The beveling machine is usable in connection to the<br>
air tool 9 being operated by high pressure air. As illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9, a connection<br>
part 21 positioned at a lower part of the adapter 20a is connected to the upper part of the<br>
cutting unit housing 10 by a screw, and a power shaft 23 of the air tool 9 penetrates the<br>
connection part 21 and is connected by a screw. The power shaft 23 of the air tool 9 is<br>
connected to the rotation shaft 24, which is connected to the rotary cutting unit 8, by a<br>
screw, so that the rotary cutting unit 8 is operated, using the rotation power of the air tool<br>
9.<br>
The ruler 30 with graduations is fitted between an outward flange 26 which is formed on<br>
the outer side of the adapter 20 or 20a and an upper end of the cutting unit housing 10.<br>
The outward flange 26 is connectedly held in an inserted part 31 formed on an inner<br>
circumference of the ruler 30 with graduations.<br>
The transfer guiding holder 40, which is connected to the outside of the cutting unit<br>
surface 10 and transfers selectively up or down, includes the rotary spline 41 formed on<br>
the outside of the transfer guiding holder 40. When the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is<br>
rotated, the rotary spline 41 transfers the rotation force to the transfer guiding holder 40<br>
and simultaneously guides the smooth upward or downward sliding transfer of the bevel-<br>
extent controlling unit 60.<br>
The supporting holder 50 is connected to the lower outside of the transfer guiding holder<br>
40 by a screw. A guide plate 6 is formed in a single body under the supporting holder 50.<br>
The guide plate 6 is held on the upper surface of the member to be processed and guides<br>
the position to be beveled upon work. An exposure groove 52 is formed in the middle of<br>
the guide plate 6 and allows the rotary cutting unit 8 to be exposed to the outside.<br><br>
Then, the present invention combines the technical constitution to prevent the transfer<br>
guiding holder 40 from being separated from the cutting unit housing 10 by the excessive<br>
rotation when the transfer guiding holder 40 is rotated and transferred downward.<br>
For this technical constitution, a ring groove 43 is formed on the outer circumference of a<br>
lower part of the cutting unit housing 10. A snap ring 44 is fitted into the ring groove 43.<br>
The snap ring 44 is restrictively transferred by a stopper 45 formed to protrude on the<br>
inner circumference of the transfer guiding holder 40, thereby preventing the transfer<br>
guiding holder 40 from being separated.<br>
In the bevel-extent controlling unit 60, the rotary spline 61 formed at the inner<br>
circumference of the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is connected to the rotary spline 41<br>
of the transfer guiding holder 40 and the fixed spline 12 of the cutting unit housing 10.<br>
When the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is selectively transferred by upward or<br>
downward sliding, the rotary spline 61 maintains the rotation locking state resulting from<br>
the connection to the fixed spline 12, thereby consistently maintaining the preset extent of<br>
bevel.<br>
Further, as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, when the rotary spline 61 is separated from the<br>
fixed spline 12, the rotation locking state is temporarily released. Then, the bevel-extent<br>
controlling unit 60 is rotated and the transfer guiding holder 40 is simultaneously rotated<br>
and transfers up or down, so that the extent of exposure of a cutting tip 8a of the rotary<br>
cutting unit 8 being exposed to the outside is changed, to control the extent of bevel.<br>
In the beveling machine according to the present invention, when the bevel-extent<br>
controlling unit 60 is transferred up or down, the elastic member 70 which maintains<br>
consistent elasticity and simultaneously maintains resilience to be returned to an original<br>
state is fitted between the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 and the supporting holder 50.<br>
A spring cover 80 is insertedly positioned on the outside of the bevel-extent controlling<br>
unit 60 and the elastic member 70 and prevents the elastic member from being exposed to<br>
the outside, to be neater. The spring cover 80 includes an inwardly protruding part 81<br>
formed at its lower end. A lower part of the elastic member 70 is elastically supported by<br>
the inwardly protruding part 81, thereby smoothly supplying the elasticity and the<br>
resilience to the bevel-extent controlling unit 60.<br><br>
In the fixed spline 12 and the rotary splines 41 and 61 of the beveling machine according<br>
to the present invention, an irregular surface part is divided into equal parts (for example,<br>
thirty equal parts in the present invention) according to the extent of bevel to be minutely<br>
controlled. The ruler 30 with graduations includes beveling graduations 32 which are<br>
equally divided to be same as the irregular surface part being equally divided. Each<br>
beveling graduation 32 is divided into thirty equal parts by 0.1 mm. The range of<br>
controlling the extent of bevel may be set as 0 to 3 mm.<br>
However, the splines and the beveling graduation 32 of the ruler with graduation are not<br>
limited to the embodiment of the present invention. The splines and the beveling<br>
graduations 32 may be divided into a number of equal parts. As the splines and the<br>
beveling graduations are divided into more equal parts, the extent of bevel can be<br>
controlled more minutely. The spline and the beveling graduations 32 should be divided<br>
into equal parts to be same as each other within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In the beveling machine according to the present invention, reference setting graduation 63<br>
is indicated on the outer circumference of the bevel-extent controlling unit 60. The<br>
reference setting graduation 63 enables an original reference point of the extent of bevel to<br>
be accurately reset.<br>
This constitution is to easily reset the original reference point of the extent of bevel which<br>
is changed when reassembling the beveling machine according to the present invention to<br>
be the original state after it is dissembled to replace the cutting tip 8a of the rotary cutting<br>
unit 8. The reference setting graduation 63 is indicated vertically. Thus, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7, when the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is rotated after the locking state thereof<br>
is released, the supporting holder 50 and the spring cover 80 are transferred up or down to<br>
be set to the reference setting graduation 63.<br>
Accordingly, even though the reference point of the extent of bevel is changed after<br>
replacing the cutting tip 8a, the reference point of the extent of bevel is easily and<br>
accurately reset, thereby providing the convenience.<br>
A process of controlling the extent of bevel according to the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
When the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is transferred by downward sliding, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5, the rotary spline 61 of the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is separated from the<br><br>
fixed spline 12 of the cutting unit housing 10, thereby temporarily releasing the locking<br>
state to allow the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 to rotate.<br>
When the locking state is released and the bevel-extent controlling unit 60 is rotated, the<br>
transfer guiding holder 40 and the supporting holder 50 which are connected to the rotary<br>
splines 41 and 61 are simultaneously rotated to be transferred up or down, thereby<br>
changing the extent of exposure of the cutting tip 8a to control the extent of bevel.<br>
In the process of controlling the extent of bevel, when the bevel-extent controlling unit 60<br>
is rotated to be set to the beveling graduation 32 of the ruler 30 with graduations, the<br>
extent of bevel is accurately and minutely controlled. When the bevel-extent controlling<br>
unit 60 being held is unloosed after the extent of bevel is controlled, the bevel-extent<br>
controlling unit 60 is transferred by upward sliding by the elasticity of the elastic member<br>
70, and the rotary spline 61 is connected to the fixed spline 12, to automatically maintain<br>
the locking state.<br>
Since the fixed spline 12 has a lower end which is processed so as to be round-shaped (not<br>
shown), the rotary spline 61 is more easily connected to the fixed spline 12. When the<br>
connection of the fixed spline 12 and the rotary spline 61 is completed, the extent of bevel<br>
being preset is continuously and consistently maintained, thereby continuously securing<br>
the uniform extent of bevel and consequently improving the quality of work.<br>
The invention has been described using preferred exemplary embodiments. However, it is<br>
to be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiments. On the contrary, the scope of the invention is intended to include various<br>
modifications and alternative arrangements within the capabilities of persons skilled in the<br>
art using presently known or future technologies and equivalents. The scope of the claims,<br>
therefore, should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such<br>
modifications and similar arrangements.<br><br><br>

4.	The beveling machine of claim 1, further comprising:<br>
a spring cover 80 which is insertedly positioned on the outside of the bevel-extent<br>
controlling unit 60 and the elastic member 70, wherein a lower part of the elastic member<br>
70 is elastically supported by an inwardly protruding part 81 formed on a lower end of the<br>
spring cover 80.<br>
5.	The beveling machine of claim 1, wherein a ring groove 43 is formed on an outer<br>
circumference of a lower part of the cutting device housing 10, a snap ring 44 is positioned<br>
in the ring groove 43 and prevents the transfer guiding holder 40 from being separated<br>
from the cutting unit housing 10 when the transfer guiding holder 40 is excessively rotated,<br>
and a stopper 45 is formed in the transfer guiding holder 40 and limits the transfer of the<br>
snap ring 44.<br>
6.	The beveling machine of claim 1, wherein a reference setting graduation 63 is indicated<br>
on an outer circumference of the bevel-extent controlling device 60 and accurately resets<br>
an original reference point of the extent of bevel when reassembling the beveling machine<br>
which is dissembled to replace a cutting tip 8a of the rotary cutting unit 8.<br>
7.	The beveling machine of claim 1, wherein a beveling graduation 32 is indicated in the<br>
ruler 30 with graduations, and the beveling graduation 32 is divided into equal parts to be<br>
same as equal parts divided from an irregular surface part in each of the fixed spline 12<br>
and the rotary splines 41 and 61.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a beveling machine which makes a slanting surface on the<br>
edge of a member to be processed, and more particularly, to a beveling machine which is<br>
capable of easily controlling the extent of bevel, by minutely controlling the extent of<br>
bevel by a simple method of using a bevel-extent controlling unit which is one-touch<br>
operated, accurately maintaining the extent of bevel which is automatically controlled at<br>
the moment of unloosing the bevel-extent controlling unit which is held, and quickly and<br>
easily resetting a reference point of the extent of bevel which is changed after replacing a<br>
cutting tip.</expianation></td>
