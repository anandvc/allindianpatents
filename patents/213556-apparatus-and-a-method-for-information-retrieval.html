TITLE<br>
Apparatus and a method for information retrieval<br>
JAPAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGENCY,<br>
4-1-8 Hon-cho, Kawaguchi-shi Saitama 332-0012,<br>
Japan, a Japanese Corporation<br>
INVENTOR Under Section 28(2)<br>
HASIDA Koiti, 5-3-311, Hinobe Urayasu-shi, Chiba 279-0013, Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes   the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a method for information retrieval.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention   relates   to an information     retrieval method, an<br>
information   retrieval program   and   to a   computer-readable recording<br>
medium on which the information retrieval program is recorded.   More<br>
specifically, the invention   relates to an interactive information   retrieval<br>
method related to   labeled graphs, an information  retrieval program and<br>
to   a    computer-readable   recording   medium on which the information<br>
retrieval program   is recorded.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the traditional information retrieval, a query consists of keywords and ID numbers combined with logical connectives such as AND and OR. Character-string matching and statistical methods have been basic technologies there. For the interaction with the user, keywords / words and phrases characterizing several subsets of the set of solution candidates are found by statistical methods, and presented as hints to let the user select some of them to augment the query. Related  art has been disclosed in the following documents:<br>
2<br><br>
Yoshihiko Hayashi, Yoshitsugu Obashi, "Technical Trend of Retrieval Service on WWW", Information Processing, Vol. 39, No. 9, 1998, and<br>
Sumio Fujita, "Approach to Retrieving / Classifying Information by utilizing Natural Language Processing", Information Processing, Vol. 40, No. 4, 1999.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Difficulty in the information retrieval usually stems from the difficulty in filling the gap in the expression between the retrieval query and the solution (difficulty in predicting the expression of solution from the retrieval query). Suppose a candidate "President Tanaka was hit by a car in the U.S.A." is detected for a retrieval request "a Japanese businessman involved in an accident while he is on business trip overseas". In this case, a complex inference is necessary, but automating such an inference is technically impossible for the time being.<br>
3<br><br>
Therefore, there will be no other way to conduct such an inference but to rely upon the interaction between the human user and the machine. To realize the interaction, the machine must provide a hint to the user concerning what to do at each stage of the interaction. The above conventional method of giving a hint based on the statistic method can deal with the general nature of a set of candidates but cannot deal with the structure specific to a particular  retrieval query.<br>
To give the user an effective hint for the interaction, further, the structure, specific to the retrieval query must be reflected on the retrieval. For example, the retrieval query "a Japanese businessman involved in an accident while he is on business trip overseas" has a semantic structure containing relations between "a Japanese" and a "businessman", "businessman" and "on business trip", "overseas" and "on business trip", and "on business trip" and "accident". However, such a structure has almost not been employed by the conventional information retrieval. In particular, it has never been systematically used as a clue to the   interaction.<br>
4<br><br>
An objective of this invention is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of retrieval by conducting an effective interaction by giving proper information to the user in the information   retrieval.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to conduct the information retrieval maintaining a high efficiency and a high pin-point accuracy by utilizing and the semantic structure specific to the retrieval query, and by interactively revising the retrieval query and retrieval space   while automatically narrowing   down the retrieval space.<br>
A further objective of this invention is to treat the retrieval query and the database to search as graphs without formal structure like a sentence of a natural language, and to improve the efficiency and accuracy of retrieval enabling the user to conduct a retrieval engine   and a suitable interaction with the   structure   as a clue.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred  Embodiments of the Invention<br>
This embodiment considers a graph (network) with labels at the nodes as the above mentioned semantic structure. It is presumed that both the retrieval query Q and the database D to be retrieved are such graphs. Based on an approximate matching or the like among the graphs, further, the retrieval query Q and the retrieval space are allowed to be modified interactively and effectively. In the case of retrieval a sentence, for example, the nodes are objects of referenced by words, a link is a semantic relationship between them, and a label is a word.<br>
14<br><br>
In this embodiment, the "retrieve / retrieval" is to find a subgraph of the database D resembling the retrieval query Q. It is considered that each node of the retrieval query Q corresponds to some of the nodes of the partial graph. Such a correspondence relationship is expressed by a function mapping each node in the retrieval query Q to a node in the database D, and the function is called a solution candidate. It is further presumed that the scores (e.g., degree of similarity, degree of relationship, values related to probability) of the candidates are defined. A set of several solution candidates having high scores is referred to as a set F of solution candidates, and there are established,<br>
F(x) = (f(x) | feF} (x is a node in retrieval query Q, and f(x) is a node in the database corresponding to the  node x), and<br>
f(Q) = (f(x) | x is a node in retrieval query Q} (feF)<br>
The retrieval query Q, the set F of solution candidates and the like will now be concretely described.<br>
15<br><br>
Fig 1 is a diagram illustrating the nodes, links and   retrieval query<br>
Q.<br>
*	The nodes x in the retrieval query Q and labels   thereof are, for example, "function", "analysis", "meaning" and "automatic".<br>
*	The   links   in the   retrieval   query Q are   "function   - analysis", "analysis - meaning" and "analysis - automatic".<br>
*	The  retrieval query Q  is  as  shown, constituted by the nodes and labels.<br>
Fig 2 is a diagram illustrating nodes f(x) in the database corresponding to the nodes x in retrieval query Q in the solution candidates f, and sets F(x) of nodes in the database corresponding to x in the set F of candidates.<br>
*	When, for example, x is   node (labeled with)  "function", f(x) is<br>
expressed    as     f(function),  (f1 (function),  f2 (function) —),  one     of<br>
16<br><br>
"function", "program", "functor", "relation", "subroutine", "projection" and "surjection" as a label.<br>
*	When, for example, x is node (label) "function", F(x) is expressed<br>
as F (function), and stands for the set ("function", "program", "functor",<br>
"relation", "subroutine", "projection", "surjection") of the f(function) over<br>
all feF.<br>
Fig 3 is a diagram illustrating ranges f(Q) of solution candidates f in the retrieval query Q and the set F of solution candidates, f '(Q), f "(Q)and f"'(Q)are ranges of solution candidates f, f" and f".<br>
*	f (Q) s correspond to "analyze ... the language ... with a program", "a iunction representing ... an intended investment", "wish to automatically rearrange ... the contents", "presuming ... implicit will", "program ... the meaning of data ... that cannot be comprehended", and "stands for ...a method  used for the analysis", respectively.<br>
*	F is a set of f, expressed as a set of f(Q), and stands for ("analyze ...  the language ...  with a program", "a function representing<br>
17<br><br>
...an intended investment", "wish to automatically rearrange ...the contents", "presuming ... implicit will", "program ... the meaning of data ... that cannot be comprehended ", stands for ...a method used for the analysis").<br>
In the embodiment described below, further, the thesaurus T is, for example, a partial function from a combination of a label L and a label M of nodes in the graph to a numerical value T (L, M) representing the degree of similarity between the two labels, and is used for the calculation of scores. At the time of finding a set F of solution candidates, there is used a subset R of thesaurus T instead of using the whole thesaurus T. For example, the thesaurus T includes a portion R that can be used being determined in advance by the user through the input unit or the storage unit, and the other portion that cannot be used. The set F of solution candidates is found not by using the whole thesaurus T but by using a utilizable portion R of the thesaurus T. Several methods have been known ("execution of retrieval" in a flowchart of Fig 5 described later and the description related to step S2 thereof) for finding a set F of solution candidates from the definition of score, expression of graph, database  D, thesaurus  T  or a<br><br>
subset R of T and retrieval query Q, and can be   suitably employed, though they are not described here in detail.<br>
For example, a score representing the similarity between the label "function" and "analysis" is given as a numerical value T (function, analysis) by the thesaurus T stored in the thesaurus storage unit 6.<br>
Fig 4 is a diagram illustrating the constitution of a retrieval apparatus.<br>
The retrieval system includes a display unit 1, an input unit 2, a processing unit (CPU) 3, amain storage unit 4, a thesaurus storage unit 5, a database (object to be retrieved) 6 and a bus 7.<br>
The processing unit 3 is connected to the input unit 2, display unit 1, main storage unit 4, thesaurus storage unit 5 and database (search space) 6 through the bus 7, and receives and outputs various kinds of information. The display unit 1 is a display device for displaying, for example, retrieval input, retrieval output, interim results of retrieval and<br>
19<br><br>
the like on a screen. The input unit 2 is means for receiving various kinds of data or the like necessary for, for example, the retrieval query, instruction and retrieval the conditions or the like, and a suitable device is used such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device or the like. The input unit 2 may further be provided with an output unit for sending data to other units, storage medium and the like. The main storage unit 4 stores various data such as retrieval program, initial setting and parameters, as well as data related to the retrieval conditions such as the final results of retrieval and interim results. The thesaurus storage unit 5 stores the thesaurus T which includes the data representing I relationships among the nodes necessary for the retrieval, degree of relation or degree of non-relation, degree of similarity or degree of difference, probability, certainty and the like. The database 6 stores the data (database D) to be retrieved, i.e., storing the nodes, labels, links and the like.<br>
Fig   5 is   a    flowchart illustrating a   retrieval   processing.   The retrieval is conducted according to the following procedure.<br>
20<br><br>
As the initial input, first, the database D is stored in advance in the database storage unit 6, and the thesaurus T or a subset R, that is, part of the thesaurus T is stored in advance in the thesaurus storage unit 5.<br>
At step SI, the CPU 3 initializes the set G of the deleted solution candidates to null, and receives from the user the input of retrieval query Q containing information related to the nodes, labels of nodes and links among the nodes. The CPU 3 stores the data related to the retrieval query Q in a suitable storage portion of the main storage unit 4, and reads them therefrom as required.<br>
At step S2, when the user clicks a "RETRIEVAL EXECUTION BUTTON" displayed on the display unit 1 the CPU 3 initiates the retrieval (or re-retrieval) as requested by the user. The CPU 3 makes reference to the thesaurus storage unit 5 and the database storage unit 6 according to the retrieval query Q that is input, and finds a set F of solution candidates as a result of searching the database D according to the retrieval query Q by using a degree of similarity among the labels defined in a portion R that   is   usable of the thesaurus T   (this method<br>
21<br><br>
has been known as mentioned above, and is not described here). Here, neither the solution candidates which are the elements of the set G of the deleted solution candidates nor the solution candidates including the elements of the set G of the deleted solution candidates, are included in the set F of solution candidates (the solution candidate is a function which is a set of ordered pairs and, hence, an inclusion relation holds among the solution candidates).<br>
At step S3, the CPU 3 offers the following information (1) to (5) to the user through the display unit 1 as a clue to the interaction (the display of a list of (2), (4) and (5) complies with the order of decreasing maximum score values of solution candidates, for example, including nodes having labels which are the elements of the list). The user is allowed to check whether the solution candidates in the set F of solution candidates are solutions, or to change the set F of solution candidates, the set G of deleted solution candidates, the thesaurus T or the subset R of thesaurus T and the retrieval query Q in an itemized manner depending upon the following information. The CPU 3 displays information related to each of the case list elements on the display unit 1. The CPU 3 deletes,    adds    or    changes     the case    list    elements   according    to<br>
22<br><br>
information input by the user through the input unit 2, stores the data in the main storage unit 4, and suitably reads the thesaurus related to the data and the data related to the search space from the thesaurus storage unit 5 and the database 6.<br>
Fig 6 is a diagram illustrating a display screen. This diagram illustrates a display of the procedure at step S3 concerning the retrieval of a sentence of a natural language and an interface for supporting the interaction. (1) to (5) in the drawing correspond to (1) to (5) described below.<br>
(1)     Set F of solution candidates.<br>
Displayed here is a list of solution candidates having high scores. In the drawing, bold characters represent words corresponding to the thesaurus expansion ofwordsinthe retrieval query. The user can carry out the operation on the display in a manner as described below.<br>
* Check whether some elements in the set F of solution candidates are solutions. This can be done by, for example, using only those data that are displayed on the list.   When they cannot be checked   by those<br>
23<br><br>
data only, the individual solution candidates are clicked to display a wider surrounding range.<br>
*	Some elements in the set F of solution candidates are deleted<br>
from the set F of solution candidates and are registered as elements of<br>
the set G of the deleted solution candidates. This in Fig 6 is to<br>
exclude the solution candidates (represented by black circles in the<br>
drawing) included in F from F (as represented by open circles).<br>
(2)     Retrieval query Q.<br>
Here, a &gt; retrieval query is displayed. The user is   allowed to add or delete   nodes, and to insert or delete links as   described below.<br>
*	In some cases where there is no link connecting two nodes in the retrieval query Q, such insert such a link.<br>
*	Delete some link   from the retrieval query Q.<br>
*	Add some   new node to the retrieval query Q.<br>
24<br><br>
*	Delete some node from the retrieval query Q.<br>
(3) Displayed here are the results having high scores obtained by expanding the labels ("functions", etc. in Fig 6) of nodes in the retrieval query Q by using thesaurus. More specifically, this is a list of labels (elements) M of nodes of the database D in which T (L,M) is defined in the thesaurus T concerning the labels L of nodes x (for each of the nodes x of the retrieval query Q). The user can specify weather the elements be included in the retrieval range (represented by black circles in Fig 6) or not (represented   by open circles).<br>
*	Subset R of the thesaurus T, which has not defined R(L, M) for several elements M of the list, is expanded for their definition such that R(L,M) = T(L,M). Or, concerning some elements M of the list, the definition  of T(L,M) can be used in the thesaurus T.<br>
*	For some elements M of the list that have been defined for their R(L,M), the definition of R is reduced and R(L,M) is not defined. Equivalently, for some elements M of the list, use of the definition T(L,M)is inhibited.<br>
25<br><br>
(4) Displayed here are labels of nodes that can be added to the retrieval query being directly connected to the nodes (such as "functions" in Fig 6) of the retrieval query Q. In more details, the list is the list of the labels L for which there exists a node zeF(x) and a node y such that the link y - z is included in the database D (for each in the nodes x of the retrieval query Q) and the label of y is L. When there are small number of such that there exists a node zeF (x) and the link y - z is in the database D and the label of y is L) corresponding to the label L, the labels of some nodes around y may be added to L as an element of the list for every such y. The user can specify whether the retrieval query Q can be expanded (black circles) or not (open circles) depending upon the elements of the list in a manner as described  below.<br>
* A node Y with M as a label and a link x-Y are added to the retrieval query Q concerning some element M of the list. Namely, the retrieval query Q is expanded by M. M can also be directly input instead of being selected from the list.<br>
26<br><br>
(5) Displayed here are labels of nodes to be inserted between the two nodes (between the "function" and the "analysis" in Fig 6) of the retrieval query Q. In more detail, this is a list of labels of nodes z included in the shortest paths connecting the node f(x) to the node f(y) in the solution candidate f(for each of the links x-y of the retrieval query Q) and not contained in the range f (Q) for some solution candidate f. The user can specify whether each element of the list be inserted in the retrieval query Q (represented by black circles in Fig 6) or not (represented by open circles) in a manner as described below.<br>
* A node z having the specified element of this list as a label, a link x-z and a link z-y are added to the retrieval query Q. Namely, this element is inserted in the retrieval query Q.<br>
Step S4 returns back to step S2 if the user requests the re-retrieval by clicking the "RETRIEVAL EXECUTION BUTTON". On the other hand, the processing ends if there is no request for the re-retrieval.<br>
27<br><br>
