				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ARYLSULFUR PENTAFLUORIDES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[001] The invention relates to methods and compositions useful in the<br>
preparation of arylsulfur pentafluorides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Arylsulfur pentafluorides compounds are used to introduce one or more<br>
sulfur pentafluoride groups into various commercial organic molecules. In<br>
particular, arylsulfur pentafluorides have been shown as useful compounds (as<br>
product or intermediate) in the development of liquid crystals, in bioactive<br>
chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides, and in other like<br>
materials [see Fluorine-containing Synthons (ACS Symposium Series 911), ed by<br>
V. A. Soloshonok, American Chemical Society (2005), pp. 108-113]. However, as<br>
discussed herein, conventional synthetic methodologies to produce arylsulfur<br>
pentafluorides have proven difficult and are a concern within the art.<br>
[003] Generally, arylsulfur pentafluorides are synthesized using one of the<br>
following synthetic methods: (1) fluorination of diaryl disulfies or arylsulfur<br>
trifluoride with AgF2 [see J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 84 (1962), pp. 3064-3072, and<br>
J. Fluorine Chem. Vol. 112 (2001), pp. 287-295]; (2) fluorination of<br>
di(nitrophenyl) disulfides, nitrobenzenethiols, or nitrophenylsulfur trifluorides with<br>
molecular fluorine (F2) [see Tetrahedron, Vol. 56 (2000), pp. 3399-3408; Eur. J.<br>
Org. Chem., Vol. 2005, pp. 3095-3100; and USP 5,741,935]; (3) fluorination of<br>
diaryl disulfides or arenethiols with F2, CF3OF, or CF2(OF)2 in the presence or<br>
absence of a fluoride source (see US Patent Publication No. 2004/0249209 Al); (4)<br>
fluorination of diaryl disulfides with XeF2 [see J. Fluorine Chem., Vol. 101 (2000),<br>
pp. 279-283]; (5) reaction of l,4-bis(acetoxy)-2-cyclohexene with SF5Br followed<br>
by dehydrobromination or hydrolysis and then aromatization reactions [see J.<br>
Fluorine Chem., Vol. 125 (2004), pp. 549-552]; (6) reaction of 4,5-dichloro-l-<br>
cyclohexene with SF5CI followed by dehydrochlorination [see Organic Letters,<br>
Vol. 6 (2004), pp. 2417-2419 and PCT WO 2004/011422 Al]; and (7) reaction of<br>
SF5CI with acetylene, followed by bromination, dehydrobromination, and reduction<br>
with zinc, giving pentafluorosulfanylacetylene, which was then reacted with<br><br>
butadiene, followed by an aromatization reaction at very high temperature [see J.<br>
Org. Chem., Vol. 29 (1964), pp. 3567-3570].<br>
[0041 Each of the above synthetic methods has one or more drawbacks making it<br>
either impractical (time or yield), overly expensive, and/or overly dangerous to<br>
practice. For example, synthesis methods (1) and (4) provide low yields and require<br>
expensive reaction agents, e.g., AgF2 and XeF2. Methods (2) and (3) require the use<br>
of F2, CF3OF, or CF2(OF)2, each of which is toxic, explosive, and corrosive, and<br>
products produced using these methods are at a relatively low yield. Note that<br>
handling of these gasses is expensive from the standpoint of the gasses production,<br>
storage and use. In addition, synthesis methods that require the use of F2, CF3OF,<br>
and/or CF2(OF)2 are limited to the production of deactivated arylsulfur<br>
pentafluorides, such as nitrophenylsulfur pentafluorides, due to their extreme<br>
reactivity, which leads to side-reactions such as fluorination of the aromatic rings<br>
when not deactivated. Methods (5) and (6) also require expensive reactants, e.g.,<br>
SF5CI or SF5Br, and have narrow application because the starting cyclohexene<br>
derivatives are limited. Finally, method (7) requires the expensive reactant SF5Cl<br>
and includes many reaction steps to reach the arylsulfur pentafluorides (timely and<br>
low yield). Therefore, problems with the production methods for arylsulfur<br>
pentafluorides have made it difficult to prepare the material in a safe, cost effective<br>
and timely fashion.<br>
[005] Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride, p-methylphenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride,<br>
and p-nitrophenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride were detected in the reaction of<br>
diphenyl disulfide, bis(p-methylphenyl) disulfide, and bis(p-nitrophenyl) disulfide,<br>
respectively, with XeF2 in the presence of tetraethylammonium chloride (see Can.<br>
J. Chem., Vol. 75, pp. 1878-1884). Chemical structures of the chlorotetrafluoride<br>
compounds were assigned by analysis of the NMR data of the reaction mixtures,<br>
but these compounds were not isolated. Therefore, the physical properties of the<br>
chlorotetrafluorides were unknown. This synthesis method using XeF2 was<br>
industrially impractical because XeF2 is overly expensive for large scale<br>
production.<br>
[006] The present invention is directed toward overcoming one or more of the<br>
problems discussed above.<br><br>

Prepared arylsulfur pentafluorides can be used, for among other things, to<br>
introduce one or more sulfur pentafluoride (SF5) groups into various target organic<br>
compounds. Unlike previous methods in the art, the processes of the invention<br>
utilize low cost reagents to prepare moderate to excellent yields of arylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride compounds. Further, methods of the invention provide a greater<br>
degree of overall safety in comparison to most prior art methodologies (for<br>
example the use of F2 gas).<br>

other like compounds. Each of the above formula (IIb) compounds is available<br>
(see for example Sigma, Acros, TCI, Lancaster, Alfa Aesar, etc.) or can be<br>
prepared in accordance with understood principles of synthetic chemistry.<br>
[0044]	Typical halogens employable in the present invention include chlorine<br>
(Cl2), bromine (Br2), iodine (I2), and interhalogens such as C1F, BrF, ClBr, C1I,<br>
CI3I, and BrI. Among these, chlorine (Cl2) is preferable due to low cost.<br>
[0045]	Fluoro salts, having a formula (III), are those which are easily<br>
available and are exemplified by metal fluorides, ammonium fluorides, and<br>
phosphonium fluorides. Examples of suitable metal fluorides are alkali metal<br>
fluorides such as lithium fluoride, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride (including<br>
spray-dried potassium fluoride), rubidium fluoride, and cesium fluoride. Examples<br>
of suitable ammonium fluorides are tetramethylammonium fluoride,<br>
tetraethylammonium fluoride, tetrapropylammonium fluoride, tetrabutylammonium<br>
fluoride, benzyltrimethylammonium fluoride, benzyltriethylammonium fluoride,<br>
and so on. Examples of suitable phosphonium fluorides are<br>
tetramethy Iphosphonium fluoride, tetraethylphosphonium fluoride,<br>
tetrapropylphosphonium fluoride, tetrabutylphosphonium fluoride,<br>
tetraphenylphosphonium fluoride, tetratolylphosphonium fluoride, and so on. The<br>
alkali metal fluorides, such as potassium fluoride and cesium fluoride, are<br>
preferable from the viewpoint of availability and capacity to result in high yield,<br>
and potassium fluoride is most preferable from the viewpoint of cost.<br>
[0046]	As a fluoro salt (formula III), there can be used a mixture of a metal<br>
fluoride and an ammonium fluoride or a phosphonium fluoride, a mixture of an<br><br>
ammonium fluoride and a phosphonium fluoride, and a mixture of a metal fluoride,<br>
an ammonium fluoride, and a phosphonium fluoride.<br>
[0047]	As a fluoro salt (formula III), there can also be used a mixture of a<br>
metal fluoride and an ammonium salt having an anion part other than F-; a mixture<br>
of a metal salt having an anion part other than F- and an ammonium fluoride; a<br>
mixture of a metal fluoride and a phosphonium salt having an anion part other than<br>
F-; a mixture of a metal salt having an anion part other than F- and a phosphonium<br>
fluoride; a mixture of an ammonium fluoride and a phosphonium salt having an<br>
anion part other than F-; and a mixture of an ammonium salt having an anion part<br>
other than F- and a phosphonium fluoride. Furthermore, there can be used a mixture<br>
of a metal fluoride, an ammonium fluoride, and a phosphonium salt having an<br>
anion part other than F-; a mixture of a metal fluoride, an ammonium salt having an<br>
anion part other than F-, and a phosphonum fluoride; a mixture of a metal salt<br>
having an anion part other than F-, an ammonium fluoride, and a phosphonium<br>
fluoride; a mixture of a metal fluoride, an ammonium salt having an anion part<br>
other than F-, and a phosphonium salt having an anion part other than F-; and so on.<br>
These salts can undertake a mutual exchange reaction of the anion parts between<br>
and among these salts (for example, see Scheme 2).<br>
Scheme 2: Mutual anion exchange reaction between salts<br><br>
[0048]	The combination of these salts may accelerate the reactions in Process<br>
I, because the reaction may depend on the solubility of the fluoro salts to the<br>
solvent used. As such, a high concentration of fluoride anions (F-) will increase the<br>
available fluoride anion during the reaction. Therefore, one may choose a suitable<br>
combination of these salts in order to increase the effective concentration of F-. The<br>
amount (used against the amount of the metal fluoride, ammonium fluorides,<br>
and/or phosphonium fluorides) of the metal, ammonium, and phosphonium salts<br>
having anion parts other than F- can be chosen from the catalytic amounts to any<br>
amounts that do not interfere with the reactions or do not so decrease the yields of<br>
the products. The anion parts other than F- can be chosen from any anions which do<br>
not limit the reactions or do not so decrease the yields of the products. The<br>
examples of the anion parts other than F- are, but are not limited to, Cl-, Br-, I-, BF4-,<br><br>
PF6-, SO4-, -OCOCH3, -OCOCF3, -OSO2CH3, -OSO2CF3, -OSO2C4F9, -OSO2C6H5,<br>
-OSO2C6H4CH3, -OSO2C6H4Br, and so on. Among them, the anion parts (other than<br>
F") which do not have an oxygen anion(s) are preferable, and Cl-, BF4- and PF6- are<br>
more preferable because of high yield reactions. In addition, Cl- is most preferable<br>
because of the cost.<br>
[0049]	From the viewpoint of efficiency and yields of the reactions, Process I<br>
is preferably carried out in the presence of one or more solvents. The solvent is<br>
preferably an inert, polar, aprotic solvent. The preferable solvents will not<br>
substantially react with the starting materials and reagents, the intermediates, and<br>
the final products. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, nitriles, ethers,<br>
nitro compounds, and so on, and mixtures thereof. Illustrative nitriles are<br>
acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile, and so on. Illustrative ethers are<br>
tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether,<br>
dioxane, glyme, diglyme, triglyme, and so on. Illustrative nitro compounds are<br>
nitromethane, nitroethane, nitropropane, nitrobenzene, and so on. Acetonitrile is a<br>
preferred solvent for use in Process I from a viewpoint of providing higher yields<br>
of the products.<br>
[0050]	In order to obtain good yields of product in Process I, the reaction<br>
temperature can be selected in the range of about -60°C ~ +70°C. More preferably,<br>
the reaction temperature can be selected in the range of about -40°C ~ +50°C.<br>
Furthermore preferably, the reaction temperature can be selected in the range of<br>
about -20°C ~ +40°C.<br>
[0051]	Reaction conditions of Process I are optimized to obtain economically<br>
good yields of product. In one illustrative embodiment, from about 5 mol to about<br>
20 mol of halogen are combined with about 1 mol of aryl sulfur compound<br>
(formula Ha) to obtain a good yield of arylsulfur halotetrafluorides (formula IV).<br>
In another embodiment, from about 3 to about 12 mol of halogen are combined<br>
with 1 mol of aryl sulfur compound of formula lib (R6=a hydrogen atom, a silyl<br>
group, a metal atom, an ammonium moiety, or a phosphonium moiety) to obtain<br>
good yields of arylsulfur halotetrafluorides (formula IV). From about 2 to about 8<br>
mol of halogen are combined with 1 mol of aryl sulfur compound of formula lib<br>
(R6=a halogen atom) to obtain good yields of arylsulfur halotetrafluorides (formula<br>
IV). The amount of a fluoro salt (formula III) used in embodiments of Process I<br>
can be in the range of from about 8 to about 24 mol against 1 mol of aryl sulfur<br><br>
compound of formula (IIa) to obtain economically good yields of product. The<br>
amount of a fluoro salt (formula III) used in embodiments of Process I can be in the<br>
range of from about 4 to about 12 mol against 1 mol of aryl sulfur compound of<br>
formula (IIb) to obtain economically good yields of product.<br>
[0052]	Note that the reaction time for Process I varies dependent upon<br>
reaction temperature, and the types and amounts of substrates, reagents, and<br>
solvents. As such, reaction time is generally determined as the amount of time<br>
required to complete a particular reaction, but can be from about 0.5 h to several<br>
days, preferably, within a few days.<br>
[0053]	Scheme 3: Reaction mechanism for Process I<br><br>
[0054]	A more complete reaction mechanism of Process I is shown in Scheme<br>
3 above. Aryl sulfur compound of formula (IIa) reacts with halogen to form<br>
arylsulfur halide (IIb'=IIb when R6=a halogen atom), which then reacts with<br>
halogen and fluoro salt (M+F-) to form arylsulfur trifluoride (formula V). The<br>
arylsulfur trifluoride further reacts with halogen and fluoro salt to give the<br>
arylsulfur halotetrafluoride (formula (IV)). As such, the compounds as represented<br><br>
by formula (V) act as intermediates in the formation of compounds of formula<br>
(IV). The compounds as represented by formula (IIb') also act as intermediates.<br>
The starting aryl sulfur compound of formula (IIb when R6=a halogen atom) reacts<br>
with halogen and fluoro salt to form the arylsulfur trifluoride. Aryl sulfur<br>
compounds as represented by formula (IIb when R6=a hydrogen atom, a metal<br>
atom, an ammonium moiety, or a phosphonium moiety) react with halogen to form<br>
aryl sulfur compounds as represented by formula (IIa) or formula (IIb'), which then<br>
reacts with halogen and fluoro salt to give the arylsulfur trifluoride (formula V). As<br>
such, the compounds as represented by formula (IIa) or (IIb') act as intermediates<br>
in the formation of compounds of formula (IV) from aryl sulfur compounds of<br>
formula (IIb, R6 except for a halogen atom). The reaction mechanism for the<br>
production of arylsulfur halotetrafluoride (formula IV) via arylsulfur trifluoride<br>
(formula V) was confirmed by 19F NMR of an intermediate reaction mixture. In<br>
addition, the arylsulfur trifluoride can be converted to the arylsulfur<br>
halotetrafluoride (formula IV) under the similar reaction conditions as<br>
demonstrated by at least Example 14.<br>
Process II (Scheme 1)<br>
[0055]	Embodiments of the invention include Process II: a reaction of<br>
arylsulfur halotetrafluoride, obtained by the process I, with a fluoride source, as<br>
shown in Scheme 1.<br>
[0056]	The substituent(s), R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, of the products represented<br>
by the formula (I) may be different from the substituent(s), R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5,<br>
of the materials represented by the formula (IV). Thus, embodiments of this<br>
invention include transformation of the R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 to different R1, R2,<br>
R3, R4, and R5 which may take place during the reaction of the present invention or<br>
under the reaction conditions as long as the -SF4X is transformed to a -SF5 group.<br>
[0057]	Fluoride sources employable in Process II are anhydrous compounds<br>
that display fluoride activity to the arylsulfur halotetrafluoride (formula IV). The<br>
fluoride sources can be selected from fluorides of typical elements in the Periodic<br>
Table, fluorides of transition elements in the Periodic Table, and mixture or<br>
compounds between or among these fluorides of typical elements and/or transition<br>
elements. The fluoride source may be a mixture, salt, or complex with an organic<br><br>
molecule(s) that does(do) not limit the reactions of this invention. The fluoride<br>
sources also include mixtures or compounds of fluoride sources with fluoride<br>
source-activating compounds such as SbCl5, AlC13, PCl5, BCl3, and so on. Process<br>
II can be carried out using one or more fluoride sources.<br>
[0058]	Suitable examples of fluorides of the typical elements include fluorides<br>
of Element 1 in the Periodic Table such as hydrogen fluoride (HF) and alkali metal<br>
fluorides, LiF, NaF, KF, RbF, and CsF; fluorides of Element 2 (alkaline earth metal<br>
fluorides) such as BeF2, MgF2, MgFCl, CaF2, SrF2, BaF2 and so on; fluorides of<br>
Element 13 such as BF3, BF2Cl, BFCl2, AlF3, AlF2Cl, AlFCl2, GaF3, InF3, and so<br>
on; fluorides of Element 14 such as SiF4, SiF3Cl, SiF2Cl2, SiFCl3, GeF4, GeF2Cl2,<br>
SnF4, PbF2, PbF4, and so on; fluorides of Element 15 such as PF5, AsF5, SbF3, SbF5,<br>
SbF4Cl, SbF3Cl2, SbF2Cl3, SbFCl4, BiF5, and so on; fluorides of Element 16 such<br>
as OF2, SeF4, SeF6, TeF4, TeF6, and so on; fluorides of Element 17 such as F2, ClF,<br>
ClF3, BrF, ElrF3, lF6, and so on.<br>
[0059]	Suitable examples of fluorides of the transition elements (transition<br>
meal fluorides) include fluorides of Element 3 in the Periodic Table such as ScF3,<br>
YF3, LaF3, and so on; fluorides of Element 4 such as TiF4, ZrF3, ZrF4, HfF4, and so<br>
on; fluorides of Element 5 such as VF3, VE5, NbF5, TaF5, and so on; fluorides of<br>
Element 6 such as CrF3, MoF6, WF6, and so on; fluorides of Element 7 such as<br>
MnF2, MnF3, ReF6, and so on; fluorides of Element 8 such as FeF3, RuF3, RuF4,<br>
OsF4, OsF3-, OsF6, and so on; fluorides of Element 9 such as CoF2, CoF3, RhF3, TrF6,<br>
and so on; fluorides of Element 10 such as NiF2, PdF2, PtF2, PtF4, PtF6, and so on;<br>
fluorides of Element 11 such as CuF2,CuFCl, AgF, AgF2, and so on; fluorides of<br>
Element 12 such as ZnF2, ZnFCl, CdF2, HgF2, and so on.<br>
[0060]	Suitable examples of mixture or compounds between or among the<br>
fluorides of typical elements and/or transition elements include, but are not limited<br>
to, HBF4 [a compound of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and BF3], HPF6, HAsF6, HSbF6,<br>
LiF/HF [a mixture or salt of lithium fluoride(LiF) and hydrogen fluoride(HF)],<br>
NaF/HF, KF/HF, CsF/HF, (CH3)4NF/HF, (C2H5)4NF/HF, (C4H9) 4NF/HF, ZnF2/HF,<br>
CuF2/HF, SbF5/SbF3, SbF5/SbF3/HF, ZnF2/SbF5, ZnF2/SbF5/HF, KF/SbF5, KF/SbF5/<br>
HF, and so on.<br>
[0061]	Suitable examples of mixtures, salts, or complexes of the fluorides<br>
with organic molecules include, but are not limited to, BF3 diethyl etherate<br>
[BF3-O(C2H5)2], BF3 dimethyl etherate, BF3 dibutyl etherate, BF3 tetrahydrofuran<br><br>
complex, BF3 acetonitrile complex (BF3-NCCH3), HBF4 diethyl etherate,<br>
HF/pyridine (a mixture of hydrogen fluoride and pyridine), HF/methylpyridine,<br>
HF/dimethylpyridine, HF/trimethylpyridine, HF/trimethylamine, HF/triethylamine,<br>
HF/dimethyl ether, HF/diethyl ether, and so on. As HF/pyridine, a mixture of about<br>
70wt% hydrogen fluoride and about 30wt% pyridine is preferable because of<br>
availability.<br>
[0062]	Among these examples of fluoride sources mentioned above, transition<br>
metal fluorides, fluorides of the Elements 13-15, hydrogen fluoride, and mixtures<br>
or compounds thereof, and mixtures, salts, or complexes of these fluorides with<br>
organic molecules are preferable.<br>
[0063]	Among the transition metal fluorides, the fluorides of Elements 11 (Cu,<br>
Ag, Au) and 12 (Zn, Cd, Hg) are exemplified preferably. ZnF2 and CuF2 are<br>
furthermore preferable from the viewpoint of practical operation, yields, and cost.<br>
Among the fluorides of the Elements 13-15, BF3, AlF3, AlF2Cl, SbF3, SbF5,<br>
SbF4Cl, and SbF3Cl2 are preferably exemplified. Fluorides of Elements 13-15 can<br>
be used preferably for the preparation of polyfluorinated arylsulfur pentafluorides.<br>
Among the organic molecules usable for the mixtures, salts, or complexes with the<br>
fluorides, pyridine, ethers such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, and<br>
diisopropyl ether, alkylamines such as trimethylamine and triethylamine, and<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile are preferable. Among these, pyridine,<br>
diethyl ether, triethylamine, and acetonitrile are more preferable because of<br>
availability and cost.<br>
[0064]	In some cases, since the reaction of an arylsulfur halotetrafluoride and<br>
a fluoride source can be slowed down by flowing an inactive gas such as nitrogen<br>
(see Examples 18 and 19), it is not preferable that the vapor on the reaction mixture<br>
and/or the gas which may be generated from the reaction mixture be removed, for<br>
example by flowing an inactive gas on or through the reaction mixture or other<br>
methods. This was an unexpected finding discovered by the inventor, as one would<br>
not expect removal of the reaction vapor to slow the reaction. Therefore, there is a<br>
case that it is preferable that the reaction be carried out in a closed or sealed<br>
reactor, by maintaining the reactor at a constant pressure, or by equipping the<br>
reactor with a balloon filled with an inactive gas such as nitrogen, or in any other<br>
like manner. In this manner, embodiments of the invention facilitate the presence<br>
of the reaction vapor.<br><br>
[0065]	Process II can be carried out with or without a solvent. However, in<br>
many cases, unlike most organic reactions, the present invention typically does not<br>
require a solvent. This presents an added advantage to performing embodiments of<br>
the invention (due to lower cost, no solvent separating requirements, etc). In some<br>
cases, the use of solvent is preferable for mild and efficient reactions. Where a<br>
solvent is utilized, alkanes, halocarbons, ethers, nitriles, nitro compounds can be<br>
used. Example alkanes include normal, branched, cyclic isomers of pentane,<br>
hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, dodecan, undecane, and other like<br>
compounds. Illustrative halocarbons include dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon<br>
tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, terachloroethane,<br>
trichlorotrifluoroethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene,<br>
hexafluorobenzene, benzotrifluoride, bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene,<br>
perfluorohexane, perfluorocyclohexane, perfluoroheptane, perfluorooctane,<br>
perfluorononane, perfluorodecane, perfluorodecalin, and other like compounds.<br>
Illustrative ethers include diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, di(isopropyl) ether, dibutyl<br>
ether, t-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, glyme (1,2-dimethoxyethane), diglyme,<br>
triglyme, and other like compounds. Illustrative nitriles include acetonitrile,<br>
propionitrile, benzonitrile, and other like compounds. Illustrative nitro compounds<br>
include nitromethane, nitroethane, nitrobenzene, and other like compounds. Where<br>
the fluoride source used for the reaction is liquid, it can be used as both a reactant<br>
and a solvent. A typical example of this is hydrogen fluoride and a mixture of<br>
hydrogen fluoride and pyridine. Hydrogen fluoride and a mixture of hydrogen<br>
fluoride and pyridine may be usable as a solvent.<br>
[0066]	In order to optimize yield with regard to Process II, the reaction<br>
temperature is selected in the range of from about -100°C to about +250°C. More<br>
typically, the reaction temperature is selected in the range of from about -80°C to<br>
about +230°C. Most typically, the reaction temperature is selected in the range of<br>
from about -60°C to about +200°C.<br>
[0067]	In order to obtain economically good yields of die products, the<br>
amount of a fluoride source which provides n number of reactive fluoride<br>
(employable for the reaction) per molecule can be selected in the range of from<br>
about 1/n to about 20/n mol against 1 mol of arylsulfur halotetrafluoride (see<br>
formula IV). More typically, the amount can be selected in the range of from about<br>
1/n to about 10/n mol from the viewpoint of yield and cost, as less amounts of a<br><br>
fluoride source decrease the yield(s) and additional amounts of a fluoride source do<br>
not significantly improve the yield(s).<br>
[0068]	As described in Process I, the reaction time of Process II also varies<br>
dependent on reaction temperature, the substrates, reagents, solvents, and their<br>
amounts used. Therefore, one can modify reaction conditions to determine the<br>
amount of time necessary for completing the reaction of Process II, but can be from<br>
about 0.1 h to several days, preferably, within a few days.<br>
[0069]	Embodiments of the invention include processes which comprise (see<br>
for example Scheme 4, Processes I and II') reacting at least one aryl sulfur<br>
compound having a formula (IIa) or a formula (IIb) with a halogen selected from<br>
the group of chlorine, bromine, iodine, and interhalogens, and a fluoro salt having a<br>
formula (III), to form an arylsulfur halotetrafluoride, represented by formula (IV).<br>
The arylsulfur halotetrafluoride is then reacted with a fluoride source in the<br>
presence of a halogen selected from the group of chlorine, bromine, iodine, and<br>
interhalogens to form the arylsulfur pentafluoride as represented by a formula (I).<br><br>
[0070] Process I is as described above.<br>
[0071]	Process II' is the same as Process II above except for die following<br>
modifications: The reaction of an arylsulfur halotetrafluoride and a fluoride source<br>
can be accelerated by a halogen selected from the group of chlorine, bromine,<br>
iodine, and interhalogens (see Examples 15-17).<br>
[0072]	The substituent(s), R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, of the products represented<br>
by the formula (I) may be different from the substituent(s), R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5,<br>
of the materials represented by the formula (IV). Thus, embodiments of this<br>
invention include transformation of the R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 to different R1, R2,<br><br>
R3, R4, and R5 which may take place during the reaction of the present invention or<br>
under the reaction conditions as long as the -SF4X is transformed to a -SF5 group.<br>
[0073]	The acceleration of the reactions by the presence of a halogen in some<br>
cases was an unexpected and surprising finding as discovered by the inventor.<br>
While not wanting to be tied to a particular mechanism, it is believed that the<br>
halogen activates a fluoride source and/or prevents disproportionation of an<br>
arylsulfur halotetrafluoride (formula IV) which may occur during this reaction.<br>
Therefore, other fluoride source-activating and/or disproportionation-preventing<br>
compounds are within the scope of the invention. The reaction in the presence of<br>
the halogen may be carried out by methods such as by adding a halogen to the<br>
reaction mixture, dissolving a halogen in the reaction mixture, flowing a halogen<br>
gas or vapor into the reaction mixture or the reactor, or others like means. Among<br>
the halogens, chlorine (Cl2) is preferable because of cost.<br>
[0074] The amount of halogen is from a catalytic amount to an amount in<br>
large excess. From the viewpoint of cost, a catalytic amount to 5 mol of the<br>
halogen, can be preferably selected against 1 mol of arylsulfur halotetrafluoride<br>
(formula IV).<br>
[0075]	Embodiments of the present invention include a process (Process III)<br>
which comprises reacting an arylsulfur trifluoride having a formula (V) with a<br>
halogen (chlorine, bromine, iodine, or interhalogens) and a fluoro salt having a<br>
formula (III) to form an arylsulfur halotetrafluoride having a formula (IV) and<br>
(Process II) reacting the obtained arylsulfur halotetrafluoride with a fluoride source<br>
to form the arylsulfur pentafluoride having a formula (I). Scheme 5 showing<br>
Processes III and II are shown as follows:<br><br>

[0077]	Embodiments of the present invention provide processes for producing<br>

formula (V) with a halogen selected from the group of chlorine, bromine, iodine,<br>
and interhalogens and a fluoro salt (formula III) to form an arylsulfur<br>
halotetrafluoride having a formula (IV).<br>
[0078]	The substituent(s), R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, of the products<br>
represented by the formula (IV) may be different from the substituent(s), R1, R2, R3,<br>
R4, and R\ of the starting materials represented by the formula (V). Thus,<br>
embodiments of this invention include transformation of the R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5<br>
to different R', R2, R3, R4, and R3 which may take place during the reaction of the<br>
present invention or under the reaction conditions as long as the -SF3 is<br>
transformed to a -SF4X<br>

[0080]	As mentioned in the reaction mechanism for the Process I, arylsulfur<br>
trifluorides (formula V) can be the intermediates in the Process I.<br>
[0081]	A halogen employable in the present invention for Process III is the<br>
same as for Process I described above except for the amount used for the reaction.<br>
[0082]	Fluoro salts having a formula (III) for Process III are the same as for<br>

[0083]	It is preferable that the reaction of Process III be carried out using a<br>

preferably, the temperature can be selected in the range of-40°C ~ +50°C.<br>
Furthermore preferably, the temperature can be selected in the range of -20°C ~<br>
+40°C.<br>
[0085]	In order to get good economic yields of product, the amount of a<br>
halogen used can be preferably selected in the range of from about 1 to about 5<br>
mol, more preferably from about 1 to about 3 mol, against 1 mol of arylsulfur<br>
trifluoride (V).<br>
[0086]	In order to get good economic yield of the products, the amount of<br>
fluoro salt (III) used can be preferably selected in the range of about 1 to about 5<br>
mol against 1 mol of arylsulfur trifluoride (V).<br>
[0087]	The reaction time for Process III is dependent on reaction temperature,<br>
the substrates, reagents, solvents, and their amounts used. Therefore, one can<br>
choose the time necessary for completing each reaction based on modification of<br>
the above parameters, but can be from about 0.5 h to several days, preferably,<br>
within a few days.<br>

[00108] The following examples will illustrate the present invention in more<br>
detail, but it should be understood that the present invention is not deemed to be<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[00109] The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and<br>
are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Table 2 provides structure<br>
names and formulas for reference when reviewing the following examples:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[00110] (Process I) A 500 mL round bottom glassware flask was charged with<br>
diphenyl disulfide (33.0 g, 0.15 mol), dry KF (140 g, 2.4 mol) and 300 mL of dry<br>
CH3CN. The stirred reaction mixture was cooled on an ice/water bath under a flow<br>
of N2 (18 mL/min). After N2 was stopped, chlorine (Cl2) was bubbled into a<br>
reaction mixture at the rate of about 70 mL/min. The Cl2 bubbling took about 6.5 h.<br>
The total amount of Cl2 used was about 1.2 mol. After Cl2 was stopped, the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for additional 3 h. N2 was then bubbled through for 2<br><br>
hours to remove an excess of Ch. The reaction mixture was then filtered with 100<br>
mL of dry hexanes in air. About 1 g of dry KF was added to the filtrate. The KF<br>
restrains possible decomposition of the product. The filtrate was evaporated under<br>
vacuum and the resulting residue was distilled at reduced pressure to give a<br>
colorless liquid (58.0 g, 88 %) of phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride: b.p. 80°C/20<br>
mmHg; 'H NMR (CD3CN) 7.79-7.75 (m, 2H, aromatic), 7.53-7.49 (m, 3H,<br>
aromatic); 19F NMR (CD3CN) 136.7 (s, SF4Cl). The NMR analysis showed<br>
phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride obtained is a trans isomer.<br>
[00111] (Process II) A 100 mL fluoropolymer (TEFLON®PFA) vessel was<br>
charged with PhSF4Cl (44 g, 0.2mol) and dry ZnF2 (12.3 g, 0.12 mol) in a dry box<br>
filled with N2. The vessel was then equipped with a condenser made of<br>
fluoropolymer and a balloon filled with N2. The reaction mixture was slowly<br>
heated to 120°C over a period of one hour. The reaction mixture changed from<br>
colorless to yellow, pink, and then eventually green. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred at 120°C for 20 h. After being cooled to room temperature, about 50 mL of<br>
pentane was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was filtered to remove all<br>
insoluble solid to give a yellow solution, which was concentrated. The resulting<br>
residue was distilled at reduced pressure to give 30.6 g (75%) of phenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride; b.p. 70-71°C/120 mmHg; 1H NMR(CDCl3) 7.77-7.74 (m, 2H,<br>

also shows the starting materials and other chemicals necessary for the Processes I<br>
and II, solvents, reaction conditions, and the results, together with those of<br>
Example 1. FC-72 (Fluorinert®) was used as a solvent in Process II in Examples 9<br><br>
and 10. The Fluorinert® FC-72 was a perfluorinated organic compound having a<br>
boiling point of 56 °C, which was a product made by 3M Company.<br>

[00132] (Process I) Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride was prepared in a high<br>
yield in the same manner as in Process I in Example 1.<br>
[00133] (Process II) A reaction vessel made of fluoropolymer was charged with<br>
341 mg (1.54 mmol) of trans-phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride, and 0.5 mL of a<br>
mixture of about 70wt% hydrogen fluoride and about 30wt% pyridine was added at<br>
room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour<br>
and heated at 50 °C for 3 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled<br>
to room temperature. An analysis of the reaction mixture by 19F-NMR showed that<br>
phenylsulfur pentafluoride was produced in 93% yield.<br><br>
[00134] (Process I) Chlorine (Cl2) was passed with a flow rate of 27 mL/min<br>
into a stirred mixture of 10.0 g (90.8 mmol) of thiophenol and 47.5 g (0.817 mol)<br>
of dry KF in lOOmL of dry acetonitrile at 6~10°C. Chlorine was passed for 3.7 h<br>
and the total amount of chlorine passed was 10.2 L (0.445 mol). After 10 mL of<br>
1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane was added to the reaction mixture, the reaction<br>
mixture was filtered. After removal of the solvent in vacuum, phenylsulfur<br>
chlorotetrafluoride (16.6 g, 83%) as a light green-brown liquid was obtained. The<br>
physical properties and spectral data of the product are shown in Example 1. The<br>
product was a trans isomer.<br>
[00135] (Process II) Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride obtained in Process I<br>

(Process II) trans-Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride (trans-PhSF4Cl) used for this<br>
Process was prepared in high yields by the Process I or III as shown by Examples<br>
1, 11, 12, or 14. In a dry box, a 50 mL reaction vessel made of fluoropolymer was<br>
charged with 10.0 g (0.045 mol) of trans-PhSF4Cl and 2.8 g (0.027 mol) of dry<br>
ZnF2. The reaction vessel was brought out from the dry box and connected to the<br>
gas flowing system. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to 120°C while Cl2 gas<br>
was added into the reaction vessel at the rate of 4.6 mL/minute. The progress of<br>
the reaction was monitored by 19F NMR. After 40 minutes at 120°C, three major<br>
compounds (trans-PhSF4Cl, cis-PhSF4Cl, and phenylsulfur pentafluoride (PhSF5))<br>
were detected to be present in the reaction mixture. The mol ratio of trans-<br>
PhSF4Cl: cis-PhSF4Cl: PhSF5 was 0.5 : 3.3 : 100. After additional 60 minutes at<br>
120°C, trans- and cis-PhSF4Cl disappeared and only PhSF5 was detected from 19F<br>
NMR. The reaction was completed within 1.7 h at 120°C. After N2 (5.4<br>
mL/minute) was flowed for 0.5 hour, the examination of the reaction mixture by<br>
19F NMR using benzotrifluoride as a standard showed that phenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride was produced in 92% yield. This experiment showed that the<br>
reaction is greatly accelerated by the presence of chlorine and the product is<br>
obtained in a high yield. This experiment also showed that cis-PhSF4Cl is formed<br>
intermediately by the isomerization of trans-PhSF4Cl, and cis-PhSF4Cl is converted<br>
to the product, PhSF5.<br>

[00140] (Process II') trans-Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride (trans-PhSF4Cl)<br>
used for this Process was prepared in high yields by the Process I or III as shown<br>
by Examples 1, 11, 12 or 14. In a dry box, a 50 mL reaction vessel made of<br>
fluoropolymer was charged with 10.0 g (0.045 mol) of trans-PhSF4Cl and 2.8 g<br>
(0.027 mol) of dry ZnF2. The reaction vessel was brought out from the dry box and<br>
connected to the gas flowing system. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to<br>
120°C while Cl2 gas was added into the reaction vessel at the rate of 23 mL/minute.<br>
The progress of the reaction was monitored by 19F NMR. After 45 minutes at<br>
120°C, three major compounds (trans-PhSF4Cl, cis-PhSF4Cl, and phenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride (PhSF5)) were detected to be present in the reaction mixture. The mol<br>
ratio of trans-PhSF4Cl : cis-PhSF4Cl : PhSF5 was 18 : 83 : 100. After additional 45<br>
minutes at 120°C, trans- and cis-PhSF4Cl disappeared and only PhSF5 was detected<br>
from 19F NMR. The reaction was completed in about 1.5 h at 120°C. After N2<br>
(26.9 mL/minute) was flowed for 1 hour, the examination of the reaction mixture<br>
by 19F NMR using benzotrifluoride as a standard showed that phenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride was produced in 83% yield. This experiment showed that the<br>
reaction is greatly accelerated by the presence of chlorine and the product is<br>
obtained in a high yield. This experiment clearly showed that cis-PhSF4Cl is<br>
formed intermediately by the isomerization of trans-PhSF4Cl, and cis-PhSF4Cl is<br>
converted to the product, PhSF5.<br>
Example 17. Reaction of 2.6-difluorophenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride and ZnF2 under a flow<br>
of chlorine (presence of halogen)<br><br>
[00141] (Process II') A 6:1 mixture of trans and cis-2,6-difluorophenylsulfur<br>
chlorotetrafluoride used for this Process was prepared in high yields by the Process<br><br>
I or III as shown by Examples 8. In a dry box, a 100 mL reaction vessel made of<br>
fluoropolymer was charged with 13.03 g (0.126 mol) of dry ZnF2. The reaction<br>
vessel was brought out from the dry box and connected to the gas flowing system.<br>
After nitrogen purge, Cl2 gas started to flow into the reaction vessel at the rate of<br>
15 mL/minute as the reaction vessel was heated to 130-140°C, at which point<br>
addition of 32.36 g (0.126 mol) of the mixture of trans- and cis-2,6-<br>
difluorophenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride was started. A total of 32.36 g (0.126 mol)<br>
of the mixture of trans- and cis-2,6-difluorophenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride was<br>
added over 1 h. After this, heat and chlorine flow were maintained for an additional<br>
3 hours. At this point, the NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed that the<br>
starting materials (trans- and cis-2,6-difluorophenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride) were<br>
consumed and 2,6-difluorophenylsulfur pentafluoride and 3-chloro-2,6-<br>
difluorophenylsulfur pentafluoride were produced in 63:37 molar ratio. The<br>
reaction mixture was then extracted with pentane and washed with aqueous sodium<br>
carbonate solution. The extract was dried with dry Na2SO4, filtered, and<br>
concentrated to give a residue which was distilled at reduced pressure to give four<br>
fractions of the product in the range of boiling point 75~120 °C at 110 mmHg. The<br>
first three fractions (total 15.37g) was a 1:1 mixture (by GC) of 2,6-<br>
difluorophenylsulfur pentafluoride and 3-chloro-2,6-difluorophenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride. The final fraction (the fourth fraction, b.p. 112-120 °C/110 mmHg)<br>
had 6.22 g of 3-chloro-2,6-difluorophenylsulfur pentafluoride (93% purity,<br>
determined by GC). The spectral data of 3-chloro-2,6-difluorophenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride were as follows; 19F NMR (CDCl3) δ 77.9-75.7 (m, IF, SF), 73.2-<br>
72.5 (m, 4F, SF4), -103.3 (m, IF), -105.2 (m, IF); 1H NMR. (CDCl3) δ 7.60 (m,<br>
1H), 7.04 (m, 1H); high resolution mass spectrum, found 275.942071 (36.0%)<br>
(calcd for C6H237ClF7S; 275.942447), found 273.945943 (100%) (calcd for<br>
C6H235ClF7S; 273.945397). The other product, 2,6-difluorophenylsuflur<br>
pentafluoride was identified by the data obtained by Example 8 (Process II).<br>
Example 18. Reaction of phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride and ZnF2 under a slow<br>
flow of an inactive gas (nitrogen)<br><br><br>
[00142] (Process II) trans-Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride (trans-PhSF4Cl)<br>
used for this Process was prepared in high yields by the Process I or III as shown<br>
by Examples 1, 11, 12 or 14. In a dry box, a 50 mL reaction vessel made of<br>
fluoropolymer was charged with 10.0 g (0.045 mol) of trans-PhSF4Cl and 2.8 g<br>
(0.027 mol) of dry ZnF2. The reaction vessel was brought out from the dry box and<br>
connected to the gas flowing system. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to<br>
120°C with N2 flowing at the rate of 5.4 mL/minute. The reaction mixture changed<br>
from colorless to light yellow, to pink, and eventually to brown in about 30<br>
minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at 120°C with N2 flowing for 5 hours.<br>
After being cooled down to room temperature, the reaction mixture was checked<br>
with 19F NMR. Three major compounds (trans-PhSF4Cl, cis-PhSF4Cl and PhSF5)<br>
were present in the reaction mixture. The ratio of trans-PhSF4Cl : cis-PhSF4Cl :<br>
PhSF5 was 15 : 20 : 100. PhCF3 (1.0 g) was added to the reaction mixture and the<br>
NMR yield of each compound was determined. The yield of trans-PhSF4Cl was<br>
2.4%, cis-PhSF4Cl was 14.6 %, and PhSF5 was 67.2 %. The reaction was not<br>
complete in 5 h at 120°C. Therefore, this experiment showed that the reaction<br>
under the flow of nitrogen was slowed down.<br>
Example 19. Reaction of phenylsulfiir chlorotetrafluoride and ZnF2 under a fast<br>
flow of inactive gas (nitrogen)<br><br>
[00143] (Process II) trans-Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride (trans-PhSF4Cl)<br>
used for this Process was prepared in high yields by Process I or III as shown by<br>
Examples 1, 11, 12 or 14. In a dry box, a 50 mL reaction vessel made of<br>
fluoropolymer was charged with 10.0 g (0.045 mol) of trans-PhSF4Cl and 2.8 g<br>
(0.027 mol) of dry ZnF2. The reaction vessel was brought out from the dry box and<br>
connected to the gas flowing system. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to<br>
120°C with N2 flowing at a rate of 26.9 mL/minute. The reaction mixture changed<br><br>
from colorless to light yellow, to pink, and eventually to brown in about 30<br>
minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at 120°C with N2 flowing for 5 hours.<br>
After being cooled down to room temperature, the reaction mixture was checked<br>
with 19F NMR. Three major compounds (trans-PhSF4Cl, cis-PhSF4Cl and PhSF5)<br>
were present in the reaction mixture. The ratio of trans-PhSF4Cl : cis-PhSF4Cl :<br>
PhSF5 was 22 : 117: 100. PhCF3 (2.8g) was added to the reaction mixture and the<br>
NMR yield of each compound was determined by 19F NMR. The yield of trans-<br>
PhSF4Cl was 6.7 %, cis-PhSF4Cl was 42.1 %, and PhSF5 was 38.4 %. The reaction<br>
was not complete in 5 h at 120°C and the conversion of PhSF4Cl to PhSF5 was<br>
lower than in Example 18. This reaction showed that the reaction under the fast<br>
flow of nitrogen was slowed down more than the reaction under the slow flow of<br>
nitrogen. In either case a flow of inactive gas has an inhibitory effect on reaction<br>
yield.<br>
Example 20. Synthesis of phenylsulfur pentafluoride by using SbF3 as a fluoride<br>

[00144] (Process II) trans-Phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride used for this Process<br>
was prepared in high yields by the Process I or III as shown by Examples 1, 11, 12,<br>
or 14. In a dry box, a reaction vessel made of fluoropolymer was charged with 1.0<br>
g (4.54 mniol) of trans-phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride and 0.397 g (2.22 mmol) of<br>
dry SbF3. The reaction vessel was brought out from the dry box and equipped with<br>
a balloon filled with N2. The mixture was stirred at 80°C for 5 h. The analysis of<br>
the reaction mixture by 19F-NMR technique showed that phenylsulfur pentafluoride<br>
was produced in 33% yield.<br>

chlorotetrafluoride (trans-PhSF4Cl) (3.0 g, 13.6 mmol) was slowly added. The<br>
reaction vessel was brought out from the dry box and equipped with a balloon<br>
filled with nitrogen. SbCl5 is a fluoride source-activating compound. SbCl5 (strong<br>
Lewis acid) can complex with ZnF2 to form ZnF(SbFCl5), which can also be made<br>
by ZnFCl and SbFCl4 both are fluoride sources usable in this invention. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was<br>

Example 33. Reaction of phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride and BF3 gas (Comparative<br>
Example)<br><br>
[00155] A reaction vessel made of steel was charged with 1.0 g (4.5 mmol) of<br>
trans-phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride and cooled on a dry ice-acetone bath. The<br>
reaction vessel was evacuated by a vacuum pump and boron trifluoride gas (BF3;<br>
this boiling point is -100°C at 1 atm) was introduced into the reaction vessel till the<br><br>
pressure reached 18 psi. The reaction mixture was then warmed to room<br>
temperature and stood for 3 days. During the time, the pressure was increased to<br>
100 psi with additional BF3 gas. After the reaction, it was found that all the<br>
reaction mixture became a solid residue. Phenylsulfur pentafluoride was not<br>
detected.<br>
Example 34. Reaction of phenylsiiflur chlorotetrafluoride and BF3 gas in<br>
methylene chloride (Comparative Example)<br>
[00156] A reaction vessel made of steel was charged with 1.42 g (6.44 mmol)<br>
of trans-phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride and 6.4 mL of dry methylene chloride and<br>
cooled to about -100°C by using a liquid nitrogen bath. The reaction vessel was<br>
evacuated by a vacuum pump and BF3 gas (boiling point is -100°C at 1 atm) was<br>
introduced into the reaction vessel till the pressure reached 80 psi. The reaction<br>
mixture was warmed to room temperature and stood for 5 h. During this time, the<br>
pressure was increased to 100 psi with additional BF3 gas. An analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture by 19F-NMR showed that phenylsulfur pentafluoride was formed<br>
in 28% yield.<br>
[00157] Examples 33 and 34 show that as Ou et al. reported, it was found that,<br>
when boron trifluoride (boiling point -100°C at 1 atm) was flowed through a<br>
solution of phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride in a deuterium methylene chloride,<br>
phenylsulfur chlorotetrafluoride was slowly transferred to phenylsulfur<br>
pentafluoride (see Can. J. Chem., Vol. 75, pp. 1878-1884). As shown herein,<br>
however, the yield was very low or the desired product was not obtained because<br>
an undesired polymerization occurred. Examples 33 and 34 show the utility of the<br>
present invention over the conventional art production method using a fluoride gas<br>
such as boron trifluoride whose boiling point is -100°C at 1 atm. The present<br>
invention preferably uses fluoride liquids or solids at least at 0°C and at 1 atm, as<br>
compared to a gaseous reactant. A liquid or solid is preferable because it is easy to<br>
handle and reacts more completely than a gaseous reactant. Also, the reactant of<br>
Ou et al., although shown to react at atmospheric pressure, would require high<br>
pressure to proceed at an appreciable rate with a necessary and minimum amount<br>
of the reactant.<br>

reference to a number of embodiments, it would be understood by those skilled in<br><br>
the art that changes in the form and details may be made to the various<br>
