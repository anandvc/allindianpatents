TECHANICAL FIELD     PROCESS<br>
The invention relates to a method  and an apparatus of grading of seeds<br>
according to vigor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional method of grading simply processes the seeds on a single screen and gives only one grade of seeds. All the seeds, which meet the minimum criteria of size of the screen, are taken as final output and the seeds, which do not, are considered as reject.<br>
For example, conventional grading process for soybeans has been described to under stand prior art technique. The input raw soybean seed contains seeds of different sizes ranging from 2 mm to 6.5 mm along with impurities like sticks, soil particles, inert matter etc.<br>
When the input is fed into the machine, it goes to the scalping screen, which removes oversize impurities, sticks and mud particles. The remaining material goes on to the grading screen of 4 mm, which removes seed below 4 mm. All the seeds above 4 mm is considered as accepted. Hence the output obtained from the process contains seeds of different vigor, germination and size.<br>
This poses several problems in the field. When seeds of different vigor are put together in a lot, the seeds having higher vigor absorb maximum nutrients from the soil and grow rapidly compared to average vigor seeds. This creates skewed and uneven growth pattern of the crop. The plant growth in field looks uneven and there is intense inter-plant competition. As a result of all this, the yield is reduced.<br>
The new process that would work on an entirely new principle of differentiating the seeds on basis of vigor and making homogenous grades of seeds.<br><br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
■	The main objective of the invention is to get the homogeneous graded seed according to their vigor, germination and size.<br>
■	The further objective of the invention is   to make   available   the graded seed required per hectare less than the non graded seeds.<br>
■	The further invention of the invention is to remove the impurities like sticks, soil particles, inert matter etc. from seeds<br>
■	The next objective of the invention is to make sorting of equal vigor seeds to get the uniform growth of the plant.<br>
■	The next objective of the invention is make available seeds   to improve the germination of the plant.<br>
■	The further object of the invention is to provide seeds to reduce the inter-plant competition.<br>
■	Further objective of the invention is to provide equal vigor seeds to get the maximum yield.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of grading of seeds comprising steps of:<br>
a) feeding the seed into the hopper of the first pre-cleaning machine from where it gets divided into two equal parts for efficient grading and goes on to the first deck which has two scalping screens of 7 mm size, where each of the above two parts is processed on a 7 mm screen, having scalp pins, which removes oversize impurities, soil particles, sticks and like impurities and pure seed (2 - 6.5 mm) passes through the 7mm screen while the above impurities do not pass through and are Collected in a reject outlet and the pure seed obtained through both the screens is combined and passed to the next deck;<br><br>

c)	the said seeds obtained from the step (b) divided into two equal parts and distributed between the two screens of the cleaner deck third stage, where each of the above two parts is processed on a 5 mm screen, which separates the seeds of highest vigor and germination grade 1(5 - 6.5 mm) from the rest of the seeds;<br>
d)	the said rest of the seeds of step 3 divided into three equal parts and distributed over the three screens of the deck of fourth stage of 4.5 mm screen, which further classifies the seeds into two grades in vigor and germination seeds having size 4.5 -5mm is collecting top of the screen as grade 2 seeds and the seeds having average vigor and germination of size 4 - 4.5 mm are collected at the bottom of the screen as grade 3 seeds<br>
and also the present invention provides an The apparatus for grading the seed comprising a pair of cleaner; one of the said pair cleaner is a pre-cleaner having two stage screens consisting of two screens of 7mm having scalp pins in the top deck forming first stage and three screens of 4 mm screen in lower deck forming second stage; a belt mechanism provided for the carrying from first stage two second stage screen; a hopper with feed pipe provide to the first stage screen; second one of the said pair cleaner is cleaner having two stage screens consisting of two screens of 5 mm screen on top deck forming third stage and three screens of 4.5 mm screen at bottom deck forming forth stage; a second belt mechanism provided between out put of third stage to input to fourth stage; and second hopper is provided to said cleaner with feed pipe for feeding to third stage.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
FIG-1 shows the schematic view of apparatus used for grading of seeds for 1<br>
stage <br>
FIG-2 shows the schematic view of apparatus sued for grading for 3rd and 4<br>
stage<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The PROCESS of grading of seeds is done in four different stages in which seeds are differentiated according to their vigor, germination and size. This method has four steps for seed processing, which differentiates the seeds according to their vigor (a technical term which describes the inner strength of the seed which determines its ability to grow and give yield), germination and size compared to the conventional process of simply screening the seeds for a single grade. The output is obtained in form of three homogenous grades which have seeds of similar vigor and germination unlike conventional process that gives a single heterogeneous grade having seeds of all kinds. A homogenous output reduces the seed-rate per acre, increases germination, reduces inter-plant competition in the field and increases the yield.<br>
The process as shown in the diagram is a 4-stage process for soybean seeds, wherein seed is cleaned at every stage to get 3 final homogeneous grades. The input contains soybean seeds of all sizes from 2 mm - 6.5 mm along with impurities.<br>
During stage I, oversize seed is separated from the input and rest of the seed goes to second stage. At the Stage 2, undersize seed is removed from the seed. During the next two stages, the seed is fine cleaned and classified according to vigor, germination and size. At stage 3, grade I is prepared by taking out the seed of highest vigor. At stage 4, the seed is again divided into two other grades having high and average vigor.<br><br><br>
This method uses advanced precision technology processing machines to accomplish the task of classifying the seeds according to their inherent characteristics of vigor, germination and size. This as explained above, gives us three homogenous grades, which has several advantages over conventional grading which gives us only one heterogeneous grade containing seeds of different characteristics.<br>
The process is performed in 4 main stages for efficient precision grading of seeds. First two stages are performed on one pre cleaner apparatus and the next two stages are performed on the second fine cleaner apparatus. Each fine cleaner used in the process is state-of-the-art machine different from the ones used in conventional method. The fine cleaner apparatus comprising a hopper(l) and a feed pipe through which seed is fed for grading, the fine cleaner has a total of five screens( 3,4„and 8,9,10) present on two decks(12 and 13). The first deck(12) contains two screens(3,4) and the next deck has three(8,9,10)screens. there are two collector(6,7) for dust, reject sticks and over size seed. A return path from stage 1 to stage 2 is done by a belt mechanism, from which seed moves from screen(3.4) of 1st stage to screen(8,9,10) second stage. It is run by the motor.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
Seed of different sizes with reject sticks and soil particles are fed in hopper of the cleaner .through pipe it comes to the first deck which has two screens, seeds are equally distributed and moves downward by sliding, reject sticks, soil particles and oversize seeds are collected by the collector and rest seeds are moved to the screen of second stage through belt mechanism. Similarly smaller size seeds are collected by the collector(l 1).I n second stage seeds are equally distributed in three parts and finally a particular size seed is obtained by the collector. In 3rd and 4th stage same process is repeated .and finally at the collector two different sized seeds are collected.<br>
r<br><br><br>
Here is example of soybean seed of different sizes, they are collected at three different places in four stages. There is also a facility to divide the seeds equally between the screens of a deck for efficient and fine tuned grading.<br>
The process diagram has been drawn for the grading of soybean seeds. The input shown in the diagram contains soybean seeds of all vigor, germination and sizes, which have been shown using circles of different sizes. The input is fed into the first fine cleaner and goes to stage 1 for processing. Now let us look at each stage in detail.<br>
Stage 1 (First pre-cleaner first deck)<br>
.The seed is fed into the hopper of the first pre-cleaning machine from where it gets divided into two equal parts for efficient grading and goes on to the first deck which has two scalpinp screens of 7 mm size.<br>
Each of the above two parts is processed on a 7 mm screen, which removes oversize impurities, soil particles, sticks etc. Pure soybean seed (2 - 6.5 mm) passes through the 7mm screen while the above impurities do not and are Collected in a reject outlet.<br>
The pure seed obtained through both the screens is combined and passed to the next deck for further processing.<br>
..Stage 2 (First pre-cleaner, second deck)<br>
The seed in the second stage is divided into three equal parts and distributed on the three screens of the second deck.<br>
Each of the above three parts is processed on a 4 mm screen, which removes the undersize seed (2 - 4mm). Good soybean seed in the range of 4 - 6.5 mm gets collected on the top of the 4mm screen and undersize seed gets collected at the bottom of the screen, which is considered as a reject. The good seed obtained from all the three screens is combined and goes to the second fine cleaner machine for classification.<br><br><br>
Stage 3 (Second pre-cleaner to first of fine cleaner)<br>
The good seed obtained from second stage is divided into two equal parts and distributed between the two screens of the deck.<br>
Each of the above two parts is processed on a 5 mm screen, which separates the seeds of highest vigor and germination (5 - 6.5 mm) from the rest of the seeds. This seed gets collected at the top of the screen and is taken out to give the first final output in form of Grade 1 seed.<br>
Rest of the seed passes through the 5 mm screen and is combined. Then it goes to the second deck for final<br>
Stage 4 (Second pre-cleaner, second<br>
The seed obtained from third stage is divided into three equal parts and distributed the three screens of the deck.<br>
Each of the above three parts is processed on a 4.5 mm screen, which further classifies the seeds into two grades. High vigor and germination seeds having size 4.5 - 5mm is collected on top of the screen and the seeds having average vigor and germination of size 4 - 4.5 mm are collected at the bottom of the screen.<br>
The top output of the three screens together gives the Grade 2 seed and the Bottom of the screens gives the Grade 3 seed<br>
Thus at the end of the 4th stage, we have three homogeneous grades of seeds wherein each grade is uniform in terms of vigor, germination, size and physical<br>
Contrasting the above three grades obtained as final output with the output of the conventional process, we see that in conventional process only undersize seed has been removed and the final output contains all other types of seeds which have different vigor and germination characteristics. This kind of an output is heterogeneous and has drawbacks that have already been mentioned before.<br><br><br>
