can be conveniently performed by palladium catalysed cross coupling as described in<br>

Interconversion of one of the R1 to R5 groups to the corresponding R1 to R4 groups<br>
typically arises when one compound of formula (I) is used as the immediate precursor of<br>
another compound of formula (I), or when it is easier to introduce a more complex or<br>
reactive substituent at the end of a synthetic sequence.<br>
For example, conversion of R1 from a t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) group to hydrogen is<br>
conducted by the treatment of the N-BOC protected compound with hydrogen chloride in<br>
ethanoi or dioxan at room temperature.<br>
Conversion of R1 from hydrogen to an alkyl group is conducted by the treatment of the<br>
NH compound with the appropriate aldehyde in dichloroethane in the presence of a<br>
reducing agent, such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or by the treatment of the NH<br>
compound with the appropriate alkyl halide, such as iodomethane, under standard<br>
alkylation conditions (potassium carbonate in DMF at 60°C).<br>
Compounds of formula (II) are known in the literature or may be prepared by known<br>
processes, for example, chlorosulfonation of the aromatic ring using chlorosulfonic acid.<br>
Conversion to the sulfonyl fluoride can be achieved, if required, by reaction with<br>
potassium fluoride in acetonitrile at room temperature. Suitable examples of an R1'<br>
protecting group are trifluoroacetyl or the t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) group.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) are commercially available or may be prepared by established<br>
procedures, for example lithiation of the corresponding bromobenzene in tetrahydrofuran<br>
at low temperature, with for example t-butyl lithium or formation of the Grignard reagent<br>
from the appropriate bromobenzene.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared using a similar process to general process<br>
A, using a suitably functionalised Grignard or organolithium reagent, where necessary<br>
utilising protection or interconversion of the functional group W. For example, compounds<br>
of formula (IV) in which W is 4-NH2 can be prepared from the corresponding 4-fluoro<br>
analogue by displacement with the anion of trifluoroacetamide followed by hydrolysis, or<br>
alternatively by hydrolysis of a protected amine function e.g. bis(trimethylsilyl)N.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) in which W is OH can be prepared by hydrolysis of the<br>
corresponding t-butyldimethylsilyl ether.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) are commercially available or readily prepared from<br>
commercially available starting materials.<br>
19<br>
Compounds of formula (VI) may be prepared using a similar process to general process<br>
A, using a suitably functionalised Grignard or organolithium reagent, where necessary<br>
utilising protection or interconversion of the functional group W. For example, compounds<br>
of formula (VI) in which W is CHO and r is 0 can be prepared by hydrolysis of the<br>
corresponding diethyl acetal. Compounds of formula (VI) in which r is 1 and W is OH can<br>
be prepared by NaBH4 reduction of the corresponding aldehyde. Compounds of formula<br>
(V!) in which r is 1 and W is Br can be prepared from the corresponding alcohol by<br>
treatment with CBr4 and triphenylphosphine.<br>
Compounds of formula (VII) are commercially available or readily prepared from<br>
commercially available starting materials.<br>
Compounds of formula (VIII) can be prepared by halogenation (e.g. iodination or<br>
bromination) of compounds of formula (VIII) where M is H, followed by formation of the<br>
lithium or Grignard reagent.<br>
Compounds of formula (IX) may be prepared by chlorosulfonylation of the aromatic ring,<br>
or by oxidation of the corresponding thiol or disulfide. Conversion to the sulfonyl fluoride<br>
can be achieved, if required, by reaction with potassium fluoride in acetonitrile at room<br>
temperature.<br>
Compounds of formula (X) may be prepared by reduction of compounds of formula (II)<br>
using for example lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to give the thiol, or using<br>
sodium bisulphite and sodium bicarbonate in tetrahydrofuran/water to give the sulfinic<br>
acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (XI) are commercially available or readily prepared from<br>
commercially available starting materials.<br>
Compounds of formula (XII) can be prepared by halogenation (e.g. iodination or<br>
bromination) of compounds of formula (XII) where L is H, or conversion of L is OH to<br>
triflate using standard methodology.<br>
Compounds of formula (XIII) may be prepared by reduction of compounds of formula (IX)<br>
using for example lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to give the thiol, or using<br>
sodium bisulphite and sodium bicarbonate in tetrahydrofuran/water to give the sulfinic<br>
acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) have antagonist affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A and<br>
5-HTg receptors. These properties may give rise to anti-psychotic activity (e.g. improved<br>
effects on cognitive dysfunction) activity with reduced extrapyramidal side effects (eps),<br>
and/or anxiolytic/antidepressant activity. These could include, but are not limited to,<br>
attenuation of cogniiive symptoms via 5-HT6 receptor blockade (see Reavill, C. and<br>
Rogers, D.C., 2001, Investigational Drugs 2, 104-109), and reduced anxiety (see for<br>
example Kennett et al., Neuropharmacology 1997 Apr-May; 36 (4-5): 609-20), protection<br>
against EPS (Reavill et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol., 1999; 126: 572-574) and antidepressant<br>
activity (Bristow et al., Neuropharmacology 39:2000; 1222-1236) via 5-HT2C receptor<br>
blockade.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) have also been found to exhibit affinity for dopamine<br>
receptors, in particular the 03 and D£ receptors, and are useful in the treatment of<br>
disease states which require modulation of such receptors, such as psychotic conditions.<br>
Many of the compounds of formula (I) have also been found to have greater affinity for<br>
dopamine 03 than for D2 receptors. The therapeutic effect of currently available<br>
antipsychotic agents (neuroleptics) is generally believed to be exerted via blockade of D£<br>
receptors; however this mechanism is also thought to be responsible for undesirable eps<br>
associated with many neuroleptic agents. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it has<br>
been suggested that blockade of the dopamine 03 receptor may give rise to beneficial<br>
antipsychotic activity without significant eps (see for example Sokoloff et al, Nature, 1990;<br>
347: 146-151; and Schwartz eta!, Clinical Neuropharmacology, Vol 16, No. 4, 295-314,<br>
1993).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may also exhibit affinity for other receptors not mentioned<br>
above, resulting in beneficial antipyschotic activity.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are of use as antipsychotic agents for example in the<br>
treatment of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders, schizophreniform diseases,<br>
psychotic depression, mania, acute mania, paranoid and delusional disorders.<br>
Furthermore, they may have utility as adjunct therapy in Parkinsons Disease, particularly<br>
with compounds such as L-DOPA and possibly dopaminergic agonists, to reduce the side<br>
effects experienced with these treatments on long term use (e.g. see Schwartz et al.,<br>
Brain Res. Reviews, 1998, 26, 236-242). From the localisation of 03 receptors, it could<br>
also be envisaged that the compounds could also have utility for the treatment of<br>
substance abuse where it has been suggested that D3 receptors are involved (e.g. see<br>
Levant, 1997, Pharmacol. Rev., 49, 231-252). Examples of such substance abuse include<br>
alcohol, cocaine, heroin and nicotine abuse. Other conditions which may be treated by<br>
the compounds include dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neurolepticinduced<br>
parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias; depression; anxiety; agitation; tension;<br>
social or emotional withdrawal in psychotic patients; cognitive impairment including<br>
memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; psychotic states associated with<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. Alzheimer's disease; eating disorders; obesity; sexual<br>
dysfunction; sleep disorders; emesis; movement disorders; obsessive-compulsive<br>
disorders; amnesia; aggression; autism; vertigo; dementia; circadian rhythm disorders;<br>
convulsions; epilepsy; and gastric motility disorders e.g. IBS.<br>
Therefore, the invention provides a compound of formula (I) as hereinbefore described or<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for use in therapy.<br>
The invention also provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>

separately or sequentially.<br>
For use in medicine, the compounds of the present invention are usually administered as<br>
a standard pharmaceutical composition. The present invention therefore provides in a<br>
further aspect a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) as<br>
hereinbefore described or a pharmaceutically (i.e. physiologically) acceptable salt thereof<br>
and a pharmaceutically (i.e. physiologically) acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical<br>
composition can be for use in the treatment of any of the conditions described herein.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be administered by any convenient method, for<br>
example by oral, parenteral (e.g. intravenous), buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal or<br>
transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions adapted accordingly.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore described and their pharmaceuticaily<br>
acceptable salts which are active when given orally can be formulated as liquids or solids,<br>
for example syrups, suspensions or emulsions, tablets, capsules and lozenges.<br>
A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a suitable liquid cam'er(s) for example an aqueous<br>
solvent such as water, ethanol or glycerine, or a non-aqueous solvent, such as<br>
polyethylene glycol or an oil. The formulation may also contain a suspending agent,<br>
preservative, flavouring or colouring agent.<br>
A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical<br>
carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid formulations. Examples of such carriers<br>
include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose.<br>
A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation<br>
procedures. For example, pellets containing the active ingredient can be prepared using<br>
standard carriers and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule; alternatively, a dispersion or<br>
suspension can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s), for example<br>
aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils and the dispersion or suspension then filled<br>
into a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil,<br>
for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil.<br>
Alternatively, the solution can be lyophilised and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent<br>
just prior to administration.<br>
Compositions for nasal administration may conveniently be formulated as aerosols, drops,<br>
gels and powders. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine suspension<br>
of the active substance in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent<br>
and are usually presented in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in a sealed<br>
container, which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for use with an atomising device.<br>
Alternatively the sealed container may be a unitary dispensing device such as a single<br>
dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve which is intended<br>
for disposal once the contents of the container have been exhausted. Where the dosage<br>
form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant which can be a<br>
compressed gas such as compressed air or an organic propellant such as a fluorochlorohydrocarbon.<br>
The aerosol dosage forms can also take the form of a pump-atomiser.<br>
Compositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets, lozenges<br>
and pastilles, wherein the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier such as sugar and<br>
acacia, tragacanth, or gelatin and glycerin.<br>
Compositions for rectal administration are conveniently in the form of suppositories<br>
containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter.<br>
Compositions suitable for transdermal administration include ointments, gels and patches.<br>
Preferably the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or ampoule.<br>
Each dosage unit for oral administration contains preferably from 1 to 250 mg (and for<br>
parenteral administration contains preferably from 0.1 to 25 mg) of a compound of the<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of the invention will normally be<br>
administered in a daily dosage regimen (for an adult patient) of, for example, an oral dose<br>
of between 1 mg and 500 mg, preferably between 10 mg and 400 mg, e.g. between 10<br>
and 250 mg or an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of between 0.1 mg<br>
and 100 mg, preferably between 0.1 mg and 50 mg, e.g. between 1 and 25 mg of the<br>
compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as<br>
the free base, the compound being administered 1 to 4 times per day. Suitably the<br>
compounds will be administered for a period of continuous therapy, for example for a<br>
week or more.<br>
No toxicological effects are indicated/expected when a compound of the invention is<br>
administered in the above mentioned dosage range.<br>
Biological Test Methods<br>
Binding experiments on cloned dopamine (e.g. D2 and D3) receptors<br>
The ability of the compounds to bind selectively to human D2/D3 dopamine receptors can<br>
be demonstrated by measuring their binding to cloned receptors. The inhibition<br>
constants (Kj) of test compounds for displacement of [125l]-lodosulpride binding to human<br>
D2/D3 receptors expressed in CHO cells were determined as follows. The cell lines were<br>
shown to be free from bacterial, fungal and mycoplasmal contaminants, and stocks of<br>
each were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cultures were grown as monolayers or in<br>
suspension in standard cell culture media. Cells were recovered by scraping (from<br>
monolayers) or by centrifugation (from suspension cultures), and were washed two or<br>
three times by suspension in phosphate buffered saline followed by collection by<br>
centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored frozen at -80°C. Crude cell membranes were<br>
prepared by homogenisation followed by high-speed centrifugation, and characterisation<br>
of cloned receptors achieved by radioligand binding.<br>
Preparation of CHO cell membranes: Cell pellets were gently thawed at room<br>
temperature, and resuspended in about 20 volumes of ice-cold Extraction buffer; 5mM<br>
EDTA, 50mM Trizma pre-set crystals (pH7.4@37°C), 1mM MgCl2, 5mM KCI and 120mM<br>
NaCl. The suspension was homogenised using an Ultra-Turrax at full speed for 15<br>
seconds. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 r.p.m for 15 min at 4°C in a Sorvall<br>
RC5C centrifuge. Supernatant was discarded, and homogenate re-suspended in<br>
extraction buffer then centrifugation was repeated. The final pellet was resuspended in<br>
50mM Trizma pre-set crystals (pH 7.4 @ 37°C) and stored in 1ml aliquot tubes at -80°C<br>
(D2 = 3.0E+08 cells, D3 = 7.0E+07 cells and D4 = 1.0E+08 cells). The protein content<br>
was determined using a BCA protocol and bovine serum albumin as a standard (Smith, P.<br>
K., et al., Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid. Anal. Biochem. 150, 76-85<br>
(1985)).<br>
Binding experiments: Crude D2yD3 cell membranes were incubated with O.OSnM [125I]-<br>
lodosulpride (-2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, U. K., and the test compound in a buffer<br>
containing 50mM Trizma pre-set crystals (pH 7.4 @ 37°C), 120mM NaCl, 5mM KCI, 2mM<br>
CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The total volume is 0.2ml and<br>
incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 40 minutes. Following incubation, samples were<br>
filtered onto GF/B Unifilters using a Canberra Packard Filtermate, and washed four times<br>
with ice-cold 50mM Trizma pre-set crystals (pH 7.4 @ 37°C). The radioactivity on the<br>
filters was measured using a Canberra Packard Topcount Scintillation counter. Nonspecific<br>
binding was defined with 10jJvl SKF-102161 (YM-09151). For competition<br>
curves, 10 serial log concentrations of competing cold drug were used (Dilution range:<br>
10nM-10pM). Competition curves were analysed using Inflexion, an iterative curve fitting<br>
programme in Excel. Results were expressed as pKj values where<br>
pKj = -log10[Ki].<br>
The exemplified compounds have pKj values within the range of 6.3 - 8.9 at the<br>
dopamine D3 receptor.<br>
The exemplified compounds have pKj values within the range of 5.6 - 8.5 at the<br>
dopamine D2 receptor.<br>
Binding experiments on cloned 5-HTfi receptors<br>
Compounds can be tested following the procedures outlined in WO 98/27081.<br>
The exemplified compounds have pKj values within the range of 7.2 - 10.0 at the<br>
serotonin 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
Binding experiments on cloned 5-HT?^ and 5-HTgr receptors<br>
Compounds can be tested following the procedures outlined in WO 94/04533.<br>
The exemplified compounds have pKj values within the range of 7.0 - 9.9 at the<br>
serotonin 5-HT2c receptor and 7.5 - 9.9 at the serotonin S-HT^ receptor.<br>

Sodium hydride (60% in oil) (2.52 g, 63 mmol) was suspended in dry dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(30 ml) and 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol (12 g, 84 mmol) in dry dimethylsulfoxide (30 ml) was<br>
added over 15 min by syringe keeping the temperature below 30°C (internal). This<br>
solution was stirred for 15 minutes to give a grey clear solution. The fluorosulfone D5 (15<br>
g) was then added as a solid portionwise over 10 minutes keeping the temperature below<br>
35 °C and the solution was stirred until the temperature began to fall, (approximately 10<br>
minutes). The solution was then heated to 40 °C and stirred at this temperature for 1.5<br>
hours with monitoring by LC and MS. The reaction mixture was then poured into 2M HCI<br>
( 600 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (400 mL x 1 and 250 mL x 2) [this extraction<br>
was done by decantation into a separating funnel as leaving the oil which had precipitated<br>
in the conical flask along with some aqueous]. The ethyl acetate extracts were washed<br>
with a mixture of water 200 mL, brine 20 mL and 2M HCI 10 mL. The combined aqueous<br>
layers were cooled and basified with 12.5M sodium hydroxide and extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate (400 mL x 1 and 250 mL x 2), washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate.<br>
