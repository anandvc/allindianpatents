				<td>(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention herein relates to an accordion laser disc protective<br>
folder structure, more specifically a protective folder with two lateral<br>
expanding structure of continuous accordion folds for storing laser disc<br>
to display with proper interval distance convenient for the user to quickly<br>
glance over the contents of the laser disc.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art<br>
The innovation of the laser disc has been a blessing to the<br>
interested collecting huge quantity of laser discs. Therefore, various<br>
kinds of inventions of laser disc protective folders, such as the invention<br>
herein, have become available on the market.<br>
The present conventional laser disc protective folders are<br>
generally in the forms of loose-leaf and fixed envelope, as shown in<br>
FIGs. 1-1,2-1 and 2-2.<br>
The conventional laser disc protective folders usually have a notebook<br>
body with a plurality of internal protective pockets formed by opposing<br>
two pieces into a pocket shape; for the secured protective pockets,<br>
there are fixed and loose-leaf styles. The fixed style has either the<br><br><br>
sealed sides of the protective pockets bounded into an album with one<br>
or two disc pockets on each page or the loose-leaf with several holes in<br>
proper interval distance for the ring on the folder to go through, also with<br>
one or two pockets on each page. However, for the fixed structure of<br>
both the forgoing conventional protective sheets, the user has to turn<br>
the pages in order to get access to the laser disc. That is very<br>
inconvenient.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to improve the problems associated with the prior art<br>
laser disc containers, the inventor herein has redesigned the fixed<br>
mechanism of the conventional protective folders for the benefit of easy<br>
access and integral storage. Therefore, the inventor of the invention<br>
herein, based on the experience accumulated from the engagement in<br>
years in professional research, manufacture and improvement, through<br>
continuous experimental production and trail, culminated in the<br>
development of the accordion laser disc protective folder, wherein<br>
accordion folding sheets on the two sides of the protective folder and<br>
several protective pockets mounted according to the interval distances<br>
of the folds for storing the laser disc; the design of the accordion folds<br>
allow each of the protective pocket to display with a proper interval<br>
distance to further allow the user foe only opening the cover of the<br><br><br>
protective folder to fast glance over the whole contents of all the stored<br>
laser discs.<br>
The primary objective of the invention herein is to solve the<br>
problem of<br>
the conventional folders of unable of allowing the user to glance over<br>
the whole contents of the laser discs but requiring the user to turn pages<br>
for searching and ending in wasting the accessing time.<br>
In order to achieve the forgoing objective, the accordion laser disc<br>
protective folder of the invention herein comprises accordion folding<br>
sheets on the two sides of the protective folder and several protective<br>
pockets mounted according to the interval distances of the folds for<br>
storing the laser disc; through utilizing the design of the accordion folds,<br>
each of the protective pocket can be displayed with a proper interval<br>
distance convenient for the user to only open the cover of the protective<br>
folder to fast glance over the whole contents of all the stored laser discs.<br>
To enable a further understanding of the said objective, the<br>
technological methods and the efficiency of the invention herein, the<br>
brief description of the drawings below is followed by the detail<br>
description of the preferred embodiment. Therefore, whatever features<br>
may be similar to the structure and usage of the invention herein should<br><br>
not be departing from the spirit of scope of the invention herein as<br>
defined in the appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3-1 and 3-2, the isometric drawings of the<br>
assembled and disassembled invention herein. The invention herein<br>
comprises an external shell body(10), a plurality of protective pockets (11)<br>
and two corresponding sides of accordion folding sheets (12, 12'), wherein<br>
the partitions (113) of the protective pockets (11) are made of flannel<br>
fabric as the main body, with pocket body (111) on the respective sides to<br>
form the pocket container (114) to store the laser disc; furthermore, an<br>
opening at the center of the said pocket body (111) is designed for the<br>
easy access to the laser disc (2) with fixing ears (115) on both sides of the<br>
protective pocket (11) for securing to the internal folding surface (121) of<br>
the accordion folding sheet (12); the accordion folding sheet (12) is a<br>
folding structure in a fan-shape, wherein the first fixing end (122) secured<br>
to the front plane (102) of the shell body (10) with the second fixing end<br>
(123) secured to the shell body (10), wherein the front plane (102) can be<br>
covered by the cover plane (101) for covering; furthermore, proper interval<br>
slots (13) between protective pockets (11) are formed by parting every<br>
protective pocket (11) according to the folding partition of the accordion<br>
folding sheets (12); the laser disc (2) stored in the protective pocket (11)<br>
can be displayed through the interval slot (13) to enable the user to glance<br>
all the laser discs (2) in order to access to the one predetermined.<br><br><br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the two ends of the required pair of<br>
corresponding accordion folding sheets (12, 12') are secured<br>
respectively to the shell body (10) and the front plane (102) of the shell<br>
body to enable the protective pockets (11) to be opened as a fan,<br>
whereat the two sides of the partition (113) fixed respectively to the<br>
pocket body (111, 111') to form the containing slot; furthermore, the<br>
fixing ears (115) on both sides are secured to the internal folding<br>
surface (121) of the accordion folding sheet (12) as an integral structure;<br>
every protective pocket (11) is placed in a certain parting interval<br>
distance for the protective pocket (11) to be opened with partition to<br>
form interval slot (13) allowing the user to read the contents of the laser<br>
disc (2).<br>
Referring to FIGs. 5 &amp; 6, the isometric drawings of the invention<br>
herein in embodiment in the style of two pockets and four pockets,<br>
wherein the folding sheets (12, 12') of the accordion protective folder<br>
can be embodied in two slots on one side as the double-slot protective<br>
pockets (110) with the similar spirit of the single-slot protective pocket<br>
(11), but with longer length of the protective pocket (11) and the larger<br>
size of the cover plane (101) of the shell body (10) and the front plane<br>
(102); the structure of the four-slot style is formed by using the opposing<br>
surfaces of two sets of double-slot protective pockets (110) as the<br><br><br>
partition and the user only has to turn to the other side in order to<br>
access to the laser disc.<br>
In summation of the foregoing section, the innovative integral<br>
structure of the laser disc protective folder of the invention herein is<br>
simple and practical in use, and has achieved the objective of<br>
enhancing the convenient effect. Although this invention has been<br>
described in connection with specific forms and embodiments thereof, it<br>
will be appreciated that various modifications other than those<br>
discussed above may be restored to without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. The invention herein fully complies with all new<br>
patent application requirements and is here by submitted to the patent<br>
bureau for review and the granting of the commensurate patent rights.<br><br>
