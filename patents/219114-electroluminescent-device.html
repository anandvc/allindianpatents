ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to organo-electroluminescent (EL) devices, in particular EL devices that comprise durable, blue-emitting organo-electrouminescent layers. The organo-electroluminescent layers comprise certain organic compounds containing one or more pyrimidine moieties.<br>
Progress has been made towards developing organic-based electroluminescent devices suitable for full color displays. Generally, an EL device is comprised of a light-emitting layer or layers and a pair of facing electrodes sandwiching the light-emitting layer(s). Application of an electric field between the electrodes results in the injection of electrons and holes to the system, resulting in the release of energy as light.<br>
However, organo EL devices have not been developed that have suitable stability under continuous operation. In particular, there remains a need for blue-emitting, stable organo EL devices.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,740 teaches an electroluminescent element that comprises a fluorescent layer containing a coumarinic or azacoumarinic derivative and a hole transoort la^r hnth "made" oforgahic compounds and laminated on tap-cttoe other.<br>

The electroluminescent devices of the present invention are otherwise designed as is known in the art, for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,518,824, 6,225,467, 6,280,859, 5,629,389, 5,486,406, 5,104,740, 5,116,708 and 6,057,048, the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
For example, organic EL devices contain one or more layers such as: substrate; base electrode; hole-injecting layer; hole transporting layer; emitter layer; electron-transporting layer; electron-injecting layer; top electrode; contacts and encapsulation. This structure is a general case and may have additional layers or may be simplified by omitting layers so that one layer performs a plurality of tasks. For instance, the simplest organic EL device consists of two electrodes which sandwich an organic layer that performs all functions, including the function of light emission.<br>
A preferred EL device comprises in this order:	-   -<br>
(a)	an anode,<br>
(b)	a hole injecting layer and/or a hole transporting layer,<br>
(c)	a light-emitting layer,<br>
(d)	optionally an electron transporting layer and<br>
(e)	a cathode.<br>

The light emitting compounds of this invention exhibit intense fluorescence in the solid state and have excellent electric-field-applied light emission characteristics. Further, the light emitting compounds of this invention are excellent in the injection of holes from a metal electrode and the transportation of holes; as well as being excellent in the injection of electrons from a metal electrode and the transportation of electrons. They are effectively used as light emitting materials and may be used in combination with other hole transporting materials, other electron transporting materials or other dopants.<br>
The organic compounds of the present invention form uniform thin films. The light emitting layers may therefore be formed of the present organic compounds alone. Alternatively, the light-emitting layer may contain a known light-emitting material, a known dopant, a known hole transporting material or a known electron transporting material as required. In the organic EL device, a decrease in the brightness and !i'e caused by quenching can be prevented by forming it as a multi-layered structure. The light-emitting material, a dopant, a hole-injecting material and an electron-injecting material may be used in combination as required. Further, a dopant can improve the light emission brightness and the -<br><br>
light emission efficiency, and can attain the red or blue light emission. Further, each of the hole transporting zone, the light-emitting layer and the electron transcorting zone may have the layer structure of at least two layers. In the hole transporting zone in this case, a layer to which holes are injected from an electrode is called "hole-injecting layer", and a layer which receives holes from the hole-injecting layer and transport the holes to a light-emitting layer is called "hole transporting layer". In the electron transporting zone, a 'aver to which electrons are injected from an electrode is called "electron-injecting layer", and a layer which receives electrons from the electron-injecting layer and transports the electrons to a light-emitting layer is called "electron transporting layer". These layers are selected and used depending upon factors such as the energy level and heat resistance of materials and adhesion to an organic layer or metal electrode.<br>

That is, the organic compounds of the present invention may provide a main component for forming a light-emitting layer, or they may be a doping material in another main material, depending upon a combination of the above compounds with the organic compounds of the present invention.<br>
The hole-injecting material is selected from compounds which are capable cf transporting holes, are capable of receiving holes from the anode, have an excellent erect of'injecting holes to a light-emitting layer or a light-emitting material, prevent the movement of excitons generated in a light-emitting layer to an electron-injecting zone or an electron-injecting material and have the excellent capability of forming a thin film.

In the organic EL device of the present invention, the light-emitting layer may contain, in<br>
addition to the light-emitting organic material of the present invention, at least one of other<br>
light-emitting material, other dopant, other hoie-injecting material and other electron-injecting<br>
material. For improving the organic EL device of the present invention in the stability against<br>
temperature, humidity and ambient atmosphere, a protective layer may be formed on the<br>
surface of the device, or the device as a whole may be sealed with a silicone oil, or the like.<br>
The electrically conductive material used for the anode of the organic EL device is suitably<br>
selected from those materials having a work function of greater than 4 eV. The electrically .<br>
conductive material includes!^	ircnr cobattr-nicked tungsten-,<br>
silver, gold, platinum, palladium, alloys of these, metal oxides such as tin oxide and indium oxide used for ITO substrates or NESA substrates, and organic electroconducting polymers such as polythiophene and polypyrrole.<br>
The electrically conductive material used for the cathode is suitably selected from those having a work function of smaller than 4 eV. The electrically conductive material includes magnesium, calcium, tin, lead, titanium, yttrium, lithium, ruthenium, manganese, aluminum and alloys of these, while the electrically conductive material shall not be limited to these. Examples of the alloys include magnesium/silver, magnesium/indium and lithium/aluminum, while the alloys shall not be limited to these. Each of the anode and the cathode may have a layer structure formed of two layers or more as required.<br>
For the effective light emission of the organic EL device, at least one of the electrodes is desirably sufficiently transparent in the light emission wavelength region of the device. Further, the substrate is desirably transparent as well. The transparent electrode is produced from the above electrically conductive material by a deposition method or a sputtering method such that a predetermined light transmittance is secured. The electrode on the light emission surface side has for instance a light transmittance of at least 10%. The<br><br>
substrate is not specially limited so long as it has adequate mechanical and thermal strength and has transoarency. For example, it is selected from glass substrates and substrates of transparent resins such as a polyethylene substrate, a polyethylene terephthalate substrate, a poiyether sulfone substrate and a polypropylene substrate.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present inventicn, each layer can be formed by any one of dry film forming methods such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, a plasma method and an ion piating method and wet film forming methods such as a spin coating method, a dipping method and a flow coating method. The thickness of each layer is not specially limited, while each layer is required to have a proper thickness. When the layer thickness is tco large, inefficiently, a high voltage is required to achieve predetermined emission of light. When the layer thickness is too small, the layer is Hable to have a pinhole, etc., so that sufficient light emission brightness is hard to obtain when an eiectric field is applied. The thickness of each layer is for example in the range of from about 5 nm to about 10 urn, for instance about 10 nm to about 0.2 jim.<br>
In the wet film forming method, a material for forming an intended layer is dissolved or<br>
dispersed in a proper solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, and<br>
a thin film is formed from the solution or dispersion. The solvent shall not be limited to the<br>
above solvents. For improving the film formability and preventing the occurrence of pinholes<br>
in any layer, the above solution or dispersipji jorfor^	a proper roctfv—<br>
and a proper additive. Th4"_"resia"ttiat can-J»-used includes fnsutattt^ resfns stictT":as^^ polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyarylate, polyester, poiyamide, polyurethane, polysulfone, poiymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate and cellulose, copolymers of these, photoconductive resins such as poly-N-vinylcarbozole andpolysilane, and electroconducting polymers such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. The above additive includes an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorbent and a plasticizer.<br>
When the light-emitting organic material of the present invention is used in a light-emitting layer of an organic EL device, an organic EL device can be improved in organic EL device characteristics such as light emission efficiency and maximum light emission brightness. Further, the organic EL device of the present invention is remarkably stable against heat and electric current and gives a usable light emission brightness at a low actuation voltage. The problematic deterioration of conventional devices can be remarkably decreased. The organic EL device of the present invention has significant industrial values since it can be adapted for a flat panel display of an on-wall televisicn set, a fiat light-emitting device, a light source for a copying machine or a printer, a light source for a liquid crystal display or counter, a display signboard and a signal light.<br><br>
The material of the present invention can be used in the fields of an organic EL device, an electrophotographic photoreceptor, a photoelectric converter, a solar cell, an image sensor, dye lasers and the like.<br>
