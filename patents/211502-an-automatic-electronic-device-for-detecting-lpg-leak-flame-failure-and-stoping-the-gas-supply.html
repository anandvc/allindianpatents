or modified features have been indicated by separate numerals.	<br><br><br>
Figure (1) of the accompanying drawing shows schematic diagram of an automatic electronic device for detecting L.P.G. leakage / flame failure and stopping the gas supply, incorporating the improvements / modifications according to this invention<br>
Referring to figure (1) an automatic electronic device for detecting L.P.G leakage / flame failure and stopping the gas supply, comprises sensor (1) for sensing the electrical charges from the molecules of flowing / leaking gas in a L.P.G. appliance and or gas supply pipe. The sensor (1) is fixed at any desired place such as out let nozzle of L.P.G. regulator, rubber tube and its joints or the gas supply pipe of hot plate.<br>
The sensor (1) consists of sensor chip (2) which has an electronic circuit (ECl) comprising of resistances Rl, R2, R3, and a integrated circuit (IC1), an electrical charge collection means from the gas molecules such as tin di-oxide plate (3) which collects electrical charges from the gas molecules of flowing / leaking gas and triggers electronic circuit ECl to switch on full load (6 to 9 volts) DC power supply to the device through DC eliminator (known type) or batteries (el).<br>
A pressure sensing wheel mechanism (4), is housed in the nut (NT), consists of wheel (wl) and (w2), link (7), pivot point (8), shaft (SI), spring (SPl) plate (PLl) and plate (PL2), one end of the spring (SPl) is fixed in to nut (NT) at point (a) while other end of spring (SPl) is fixed at<br>
       point (b) of link-(7). When diaphragm (S) fluctuates with varying gas pressure the plate (PL2)on<br>
shaft (S1) pushes wheel (w2) which turns wheel (w3) and pointer (PTI) attached to wheel (w3) makes electrical contact between insulated tooth of wheel (wl), the link (7) attached to wheel (w2) and pivoted at point (8) moves and puts spring (SPl) in tension, this pressure sensing wheel mechanism (4), is to control and regulate the power requirement of device and gas leak sensitivity with the help of diaphragm (5) fluctuating with the flowing/ leaking gas pressure. Maximum area of tin di-oxide plate (3), attached to diaphragm (5), get exposed to leaking / flowing gas at different pressure to collect constant charge from gas molecules.<br>
The DC power supply switched on by electronic circuit EC1 now reaches to a single modified electronic circuit (EC4) which comprises a electronic circuit (9) consisting a press switch (known type) a (IC2), resistance (R7) and (R8) to distribute the current and to disconnect audio (B) and visual    (L1) and to connect flame indication light lamp (L2) with the help of a<br>
Mechanism (Me) of the heat-sensing switch (HSS1), when gas is ignited at burner during normal use.<br>
The said heat sensing switch (HSS1) which comprises a body (BO) housing in it a mechanism (Me). The said mechanism (Me) consisting of a heat sensing Bi-metallic strip (BM1) whose one end (Al) is fixed at the end (A2) of a swing shaft (SW1) and its other end (Bl) is kept pressed against the body (BO) by giving it a parabolic or any other shape.<br>
The said swing shaft (SW1), at its center, pivotally mounted on a pin (Pn) whose two ends (A3) and (B3) are supported in to the body (BO) a moving electrical contact (P7) and one end of a spring (SP) is fixed at end (B2) of swing shaft (SW1) and other end of the spring (SP) is fixed in to the body (BO) and kept in tension so the moving electrical contact point (P7) is in contact with<br><br><br>
Affixed electrical contact point (P8) in normal condition. The said electrical contact point (P8) provides electrical signal to (IC2) of electronic circuit (EC4) which is further connected to audio (BO) and /or Visual (L1) alarm and light lamp (L2) through resistances (R4), (R5), (R6) and (R7) and a diode (D1) to indicate the leak of gas, when gas molecules are passing through sensor chip (2) in sensor (1) i je. either the gas is leaking or flowing for normal use.<br>
In case when gas is ignited at burner for normal use, the heat of flame, appeared on burner, is provided to heat sensing Bi-metallic bend strip (BM1), whose one end ((B1) kept pressed against body (BO), moves away from body (BO) by its bending action due to heat of flame so the spring (SP) drags end (B2) of swing shaft (SWl) and turn it on pin (Pn) thus the moving electrical contact point (P7) disconnects fixed electrical contact point (P8) which provides electrical signal to (IC2) to change the out put electrical polarity of (IC2) to stop the function of audio(B)and/or visual (Ll)alarm and to start the function of flame indication light lamp (L2) shows gas is ignited at burner . The function of heat sensing Bi-metallic bend strip (BM1) is shown by dotted lines. (BM1)<br>
In case of failure of flame at burner, the heat sensing Bi-metallic bend strip (BM1) will not receive heat of the flame, and start to cool so its end (Bl) will start to bend back to words the body (BO) and puts spring (SP) back in tension and turn the swing shaft (SWl) on pin (Pn) thus the end.(B2) of swing shaft (SWl) moves and moving electrical point (P7) makes contact with fixed electrical point (P8) which again provides electrical signal to (IC2) to cliange out put electrical polarity of (IC2) to stop the function of the flame indication light lamp (L2) and to start function of the audio(B) and/or visual (L1) alarm, indicating gas is leaking/flowing from burner.<br>
An electronic timer (JET), known type, is connected to audio (B) and / or visual (L1) alarm at point (01) and in case of continuous audio visual alarm signals for a predetermined time, say 15 seconds, indicating a continuous leak of gas either from L.P.G. installation or from burner or due to failure of flame at burner, the current passes through electronic timer (ET) to a electro-magnet (EM2) of a solenoid, known type, of an automatic gas supply stopping mechanism (10) to stop the supply of gas to hot plate.<br>
The automatic gas supply stopping mechanism (10) housed in a body of two plates (CP1) and (CP2) and consisting in it a solenoid, known type, having an electro-magnet (EM2), a shaft (SS)<br>
And a spring (SSP2), a shaft (SHI) mounting on it gear (Gl), pin (Pn3), knob (KB1), knob (KB2) covers the knob (KB3) of regulator (Rg) mounted on gas cylinder (GC), a spiral spring (CS3) whose one end (El) is fixed on plate (CP1) and other end is fixed on the shaft (SHI), a shaft (SH2) mounting on it gear (G2) and (G3), shaft (SH3) mounting on it pins (Pnl) and (Pn2) and a leaf switch, known type having two strip (ST1) and (ST2) with electrical contact points (EP1) and (EP2).<br>
In the said automatic gas supply stopping mechanism (10), the gear (Gl) is kept engaged with gear (G2) and the knob (KB 1) fixed at the end (A4) of shaft (SHI) is to turn the shaft (SHI) and to put spring (CS3) in tension which also to turn regulator knob (KB3) to on position for the gas supply, at this time the pin (Pnl) locks with ratchet gear (G3) and pin (Pn3) is stopped by solenoid shaft (SS).<br><br><br>
The current so passed by electronic timer (ET) to electro-magnet (EM2) of solenoid, known type, creates electromagnetic force, which pulls shaft (SS) and releases the pin (Pn2) and so the pin (Pnl) turns on shaft (SH3) to UN locks the ratchet gear (G3). The gear (G2) mounted on the (SH2) rotates so the gear(Gl) and shaft (SHI) rotates to release the tension of spring (CS3) and closes the regulator knob to stop the supply of gas to L.P.G. installation.<br>
The said automatic gas supply stopping mechanism (10) is apart of a cover (18) and knob (KB1) is to operate the mechanism, manually, from outside of cover (18) when it is fixed at the neck of L.P.G. cylinder (GC) enclosing the regulator (Rg).<br>
The said cover (18) is of removable type and became gas tight when fixed at L.P.G. Cylinder (CG)<br>
A pressure sensor (PS) is provided inside of cover (18) comprises a diaphragm (19) and a press switch (200, known type, The said press switch (20) is having two electrical contact points (P10) and (P11), where in point (PI 1) is connected to dry battery cells (e2) and point (P10) is connected to point (01) to audio (B) and / or visual (LI) through resistance (R5) and (R6). The leaked gas from L.P.G. cylinder (GC) and regulator (Rg) joint get trapped and collected in side of cover (18), exerts pressure on diaphragm (19) to press the point (PI 1) of press switch (20), to contact point (P10),thus the DC power supplied by-dry-battery cell(e2) passes-to audio (B) and/or visual (L1) alarm to indicate the leak of gas.<br>
The above description with references to fig (1) is only given to understand the invention and improvements and or modifications rather than to limit its scope, as various modifications are possible with in the scope of this Jnvention, some of them are press switch(9)heat sensing" switch  (HSS1) and electronic circuit (EC4) may vary in its number according to the number of burners in a L.P.G. appliance, similarly dry battery cells (e2) can be dispense with and pressure sensor (PS) can be connected through batteries (el) however press switch (9) can be eliminated for single burner   L.P.G. appliance   as current distribution is not required and DC current |<br>
