				<td>A SYNERGISTIC ANTILEUKOTRIENE ANTIHISTAMINIC ANTI-ALLERGY ANTIINFLAMMATORY COMPOSITION COMPRISING NIMESULIDE AND CETIRI2INE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel antileukotnene, antihistaminic, antiallergic and antiinflammatory composition of non-steroidal antiinflammatory sulfonanilide and salts thereof With second generation antihistamines (H1. blockers)<br>
More particularly the invention relates to a novel composition of Nimesulide and Cetinzine in a pharmaceutically acceptable combination in a suitable pharmaceutical base acceptable and excipients<br>
More particularly the invention relates to a composition for use in allergic disorders namely rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, urticaria etc<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The clinical symptoms produced in the course of allergic reaction are the result of an early specific immune response and a late inflammatory reaction The inhaled allergens (e g pollens, mite dust) mediate the early phase by stimulating high affinity immunoglobulin (lgE) receptors e g. mast cells and basophils which in turn release histamine and cytokines. This early phase lasts for about 30 minutes The cytokines released from mast cells and basophils then mediate the late phase by recruiting inflammatory cells into the nasal and upper respiratory tract passages (Serafin, WE, In Goodman and Gillmans " The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics ", Hardmen, Ja, Limbird, L,E eds, Mc Graw - Hill, New York, 1996, 659 - 682) The influx of eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets starts the vicious inflammatory cycle This late phase<br>
lasting for 8-48 hours amplifies the initial immune response which in turn triggers the release of more inflammatory cells (Townley RG and Okada, C, Annals of Allergy, 68, 1991, 190-196)<br>
Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is caused by deposition of allergens on the nasal mucosa resulting in an immediate hypersensitivity reaction If the allergens (e,g   dust mite) are carried to the lower airways (i e   bronchioles), in susceptible<br>
subjects, the result is bronchoconstnction of the airways (i.e asthma) The allergen-induced release of leukotrienes, the 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism in activated airway cells, is critical in the pathophysiology of asthma. Leukotrienes are produced by mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. The use of specific leukotnene receptor antagonists or 5-iipoxygenase pathway inhibitors results in increased airflow and reduction of symptoms in asthmatic patients (Henderson WR, Jr., Annals of Allergy, 72, 1994, 272-277) Immunologic concepts of asthma and related allergic disorders are undergoing revolutionary changes All asthma are now proposed to have an allergic basis and all chronic allergic disorders have a basal ongoing inflammation which is never fully resolved In the annual meeting of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology which took place in Greece, June 1-5, 1997, the clinical implications of minimal persistent inflammation (MPI) have been emphasized A mild presence of inflammatory cells and ICAM -1 receptors on epithelial cells has been demonstrated even during asymptomatic periods in allergic subjects. So the correct treatment of allergic disorders should address allergic inflammation and not just the symptoms In this annual meeting a redefinition of allergic disorders was also emphasized Rhinitis and asthma were pooled together as the inflammatory mechantsms that represent a common unifying concept for the pathogenesis of allergic disorders Allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma frequently co-exist Upto 40% of rhinitics have concomitant asthma and upto 80% of asthmatics also have rhinitis Rhinitics have upto three fold greater risk<br>
of developing asthma as the inflammatory mediators, constantly being released in the airways, may produce alterations in the airway epithelium such that an allergic person becomes prone to asthmatic attacks (Wenzel, S E, Annals of Allergy, 72, 1994, 261 - 271) It was thus proposed that treating nasal and airway inflammation may be a key to asthma control It was concluded that development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention and prophylaxis of respiratory allergy should be approached rather than the treatment except for asthmatic emergencies<br>
Thus it is self-evident that although antihistamines (second generation H-,-blockers) are the most widely used agents for the treatment of allergic conditions (Gong, H, Tashkin, D P, Dauphinee, B et al, J.AIIergy. Clin. Immunol., 85, 1990, 632 - 641), NSAIDS can also prove to be very useful as anti-inflammatory drugs Till date, NSAIDS like aspirin, its analogues and even unrelated chemical moieties could not<br>
be used in allergic disorders because of the precipitation of a pseudoallergic reaction in aspirin intolerant patients Despite their anti-inflammatory effects, almost all NSAIDS potentiate lgE-mediated histamine release from mast cells and basophils resulting in vasomotor rhinitis, urticaria and bronchial asthma in these patients (Bianco, S, Robuschi, M, Petngni, Getai, Drugs, 46, 1993, 115-120)<br>
However, one unique NSAID stands out from the rest Nimesulide, a sulfonanilide NSAID, is well tolerated by patients with all allergic disorders and aspirin idiosyncrasy (Casolaro,V, Meliota,S, Marino,O et al, J Pharmacol Exp. Ther, 267, 1993, 1375 - 1385) It has a profound antihistamine, antianaphylactic activity (Berti.F, Rossoni.G, Buschi, A et al, Arznemittel Forschung, 40, 1990, 1011-1016). in addition to its potent anti inflammatory action (Serafin, WE, 1996; Bellusi, L, Passah, D, Drugs (46) Suppl. 1, 1993, 107 - 110) Nimesulide inhibits the allergen induced immunologic release of<br>
histamine and also improves bronchial responsiveness in asthmatic patients exposed to bronchoconstnctors (Casolaro.V, et al 1993, Berti.F, et al 1990).<br>
All above studies only indicated the possible extension of antiinflammatory action of Nimesulide for control of inflammation of upper respiratory tract However, the use of Nimesulide as an antiasthmatic due to antiallergic and leukotnene inhibiting activities of Nimesulide has not been reported so far, and by careful experimentation and application of scientific logic, the inventors combined Nimesulide with Cetirizme in different proportions and carried out several experiments to see the utility of such a combination for use as an antiasthmatic agent It has been surprisingly observed by the inventors and described in the present invention that a combination of Nimesulide with Cetirizme is synergistic composition and of immense utility in asthma<br>
Other anti-inflammatory drugs used in chronic rhinitis, chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma are cromolyn sodium, nedocromil and glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid therapy is not without an accompanied risk of myriad side effects (Serafin, WE, 1996) Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil can only be given by inhalation, only about 1% of an oral dose of cromolyn is absorbed Even when inhaled, cromolyn sodium has to be taken 4 times daily due to its short half-life  of<br>
45-100 minutes Nedocromil is reported to leave a bad taste in mouth Several other anti-inflammatory agents have been assessed, mainly as steroid-sparing agents These include methotrexate, gold, troleandomycin, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone and cyclosporin But their efficacy has not been firmly established (Szefler, S., Antiinflammatory drugs in the treatment of allergic diseases., Medical Clinics of North America, 76, 1992, 953 - 975)<br>
US Patent 5658948 granted to ALLERGAN INC., discloses a formulation and method includes an acceptable drug, such as Prostaglandins, Flurbiprofen, Keterolac, Tromethamine, Cetinzine HCI, Indomethacin and Bufrolin, which are interactive with benzalkonium chloride to form a precipitate along with benzalkonium chloride acting as a preservative and an amino acid having enough positive charge at the pH of the formulation and/or Tromethamine present in an amount sufficient to interfere with the interaction between the drug and benzalkonium chloride in order to maintain the preservative activity of the benzalkonium chloride Further, the use of Lysine, L-arginine, or Histidme is also useful in reducing the cytotoxicity of the formulation<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel composition of Nimesulide and salts thereof and Cetirizme possessing antileukotriene, antihistaminic, antiallergic and antiinflammatory action<br>
The composition is useful in the cure of allergic disorders such as rhinitis, bronchitis,<br>
asthma, urticaria and the like<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following unique features of Nimesulide may prove to be quite beneficial in all allergic disorders<br>
1)	Nimesulide is a potent stabilizer of mast cells and basophils. Thus, it prevents the release of histamine, proteases, TNF- 71, Prostaglandins, teukotnenes, PAF and other cytokines from activated mast cells.<br>
2)	Nimesulide indirectly blunts the eosinophil deluge in asthmatic attacks because of its mast cell and basophil stabilizing property Mast cells and basophils release an eosinophil chemotactic factor that causes eosinophils to migrate towards inflamed allergic tissue. Nimesulide is also reported to inhibit chemotaxis and synthesis of platelet activating factor and teukotnenes by human eosinophils<br>
3)	Nimesulide potently inhibits the phosphodiesterase type IV in human<br>
polymorphonuclear leukocytes The resultant increase in cAMP accounts for a<br>
marked decrease in chemotaxis, degranulation and free radical generation. PDE-IV<br>
inhibitors are finding a place as anti-asthmatic drugs<br>
4)	Nimesulide inhibits the neutrophil respiratory burst and hence the release of free radicals, cytokines, eicosanoids, prostaglandins etc<br>
5)	Nimesulide is a potent anti-oxidant. Hence it prevents tissue injury at sites of inflammation by maintaining natural host protective systems<br>
Second generation Histamine (H-treceptor) antagonist (e g cetirizine, fexofenadine, acrivastine, astemizole, loratidine etc) are the drugs of choice in the treatment of allergic rhinitis as they are long acting and are free from sedative and anticholinergic effects. In addition, second generation antihistamines have the following unusual and potentially beneficial properties<br>
1)	These non-sedative anti-histamines have demonstrated dose-related protection against histamine induced bronchoconstriction<br>
2)	These have been shown to protect against exercise, ultrasonic nebulized distilled water and cold air induced bronchoconstriction<br>
3)	These produce modest but statistically significant acute bronchodilation in mild to moderate asthma<br>
4)	Cetirizine is reported to have an anti inflammatory property tn addition to its Hr antagonizing action Cetirizine inhibits inflammatory celt migration by potently inhibiting eosinophil influx and eosinophil degranulation<br>
5)	ICAM-1 expression is a sensitive marker of mucosal allergic inflammation. ICAM-1 is also the receptor for most human rhinoviruses, which are the cause of more than 80% of asthmatic attacks in children It has been reported that<br>
Cetirizine is able to modulate and down regulate ICAM -1 expression in epithelial cells<br>
6)	Cetirizine is very effective in inhibiting the cutaneous early &amp; late phase responses<br>
by inhibiting PAF and eosinophil recruitment in skin In a recent report, almost 70%<br>
chronic hives patients reported excellent results on a daily regimen of 10mg of<br>
cetirizine. Compared to other antihistamines cetirizine treatment produced faster,<br>
more potent and more long-lasting relief of wheals and flares<br>
7)	Cetirizine does not cause cardiac arrhythmias reported by some other antihistamines<br>
8)	Continuous Cetirizine treatment is reported to be better than on-demand treatment in rhinitis sensitive to pollens<br>
Our findings as disclosed in this patent application indicate that sulfonanilide NSAIDs e g Nimesulide and thereof when combined with cetirizine forms an excellent synergistic antileukotnene, antihistaminic, anti-allergy and antiinflammatory composition<br>
By careful experimentation the inventors have found that although Nimesulide does not block an exogenousfy administered histamine but very effectively blocks the release of histamine by stabilizing the mast cells and basophills as evident from egg albumin experiment as disclosed in the present invention<br>
The histamine released if any will be blocked by Cetirizine. Surprisingly, we also found out that Nimesulide as well as Cetirizine have a leukotnene action which is synergistic when the drugs are combined as evident from the Table 3.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is disclosed a novel composition of Nimesulide and salts thereof and Cetirizine possessing antileukotnene, antihistaminic, anti-allergy and antiinflammatory action<br>

EXPERIMENT TO STUDY THE ANTIASTHMATIC ACTIVITY OF NIMESULIDE AND CETIRIZINE<br>
Antiasthmatic activity of Nimesulide and Cetinzine was studied on histamine-induced, egg albumin-induced and leukotnene-D4-induced brochospasm in guinea pig in vivo.<br>
Materials &amp; Method : Animals<br>
Guinea pig 300 - 350 g either sex, housed in the Central Animal house of Panacea Biotec Ltd , Lalru and kept under standard laboratory conditions, were used<br>
Procedure<br>
Urethane - anaesthetised, 18-h fasted guinea pigs 300 - 350 g were used d-tubocurarme (3 mg/kg i v) was administered to prevent spontaneous respiratory movements Guinea pigs were artificially ventilated by a UGO Basile Rodent ventilator through a tracheal cannula at a rate of 60 strokes/min. and a stroke volume of 1 ml/100 g Insufflation pressure was measured by attaching a pressure transducer (UGO Basile) to a Gemini two channel recorder (UGO Basile) A polyethylene catheter was inserted in the left jugular vein for iv administration of drugs The animals were stabilized for 10 minutes<br>
% Insufflation pressure was calculated as the % increase in pressure due to constriction of the airways with respect to the basal pressure Less % insufflation pressure denotes less bronchoconstriction caused due to the effect of test compounds with respect to the basal tone of the airways<br>
Drugs<br>
Nimesulide and Cetinzine dihydrochlonde (Panacea Biotec Ltd., India), Histamine, Leukotnene D4 and Urethane (all from Sigma, USA), d-tubocuranne chloride (Diosynth, Netherlands), Egg albumin (Qualigens Fine Chemicals, Bombay). Cetirizine was dissolved in deionized water Nimesulide was suspended in 0 25% Xanthum gum. Histamine and d-tubocuranne chloride were dissolved in saline and Leukotnene D4 was diluted with Methanol and Ammonium Acetate buffer in a ratio of 70   30 at a pH of 5 4<br>
Statistical Analysis<br>
Unpaired students t-test was applied and p 
Experimental Protocol Group I        Histamine treated<br>
Histamine challenge (5 ng/kg and 10 _1g/kg iv) was given to the animal and increase in insufflation pressure was noted in the control group (Table 1)<br>
Test compounds (Nimesulide, Cetinzine, Ntmesulide + Cetirizine) were given 2 hours before histamine challenge in the test group Any decrease in the insufflation pressure was noted (Table. 1)<br>
Group II	Egg albumin treated<br>
Guinea pigs were sensitized by injections of 100 mg of Egg albumin ip and 100 mg Egg albumin sc in saline Guinea pigs were used after day 21st Animals were chaffenged with 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg of Egg albumin and increase in insufflation pressure was noted (Table 2)<br>
Group III       Leukotriene D4 treated<br>
LTD4 challenge (1 pg/kg and 2 ug/kg) was given to the animal and increase in<br>
insufflation pressure was noted in the control group (Table 3).<br>
Test compounds (Nimesulide, Cetinzine, Nimesulide + Cetinzine) were given 2 hours before LTD4 challenge in the test group Any decrease in the insufflation pressure was noted (Table 3) with respect to the control group<br>
Results :<br>
Cetirizine (1 66 mg/kg) significantly reduced the histamine (5 and 10 Dg/kg) induced increase in insufflation pressure Nimesulide (single dose, S, 1166 mg/kg and double dose, D, 23 32 mg/kg) had no significant inhibitory effect on the insufflation pressure<br>
Combination of Nimesulide (single dose, S) and Cetinzine showed no significant effect whereas Nimesulide (double dose, D) and Cetirizine had potent antihistaminic effect<br>
Nimesulide (1166 mg/kg) significantly reduced the egg albumin  induced (1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg) insufflation pressure, the effect of Nimesulide was 92 0 to 94.0% Cetirizine (1.66 mg/kg) also reduced the insufflation pressure but it is slightly less than that of Nimesulide In combination Nimesulide and Cetinzine also showed a highly significant effect as compared to the control (Table. 2).<br>
Nimesulide (11 66 mg/kg) had no effect on the insufflation pressure whereas Cetirizine   (1 16   mg/kg)    significantly   blocked    LTD4-induced    contractions Combination of Nimesulide (11 66 mg/kg) and Cetirizine (1.16 mg/kg) potently blocked the leukotriene induced contractions   Double dose Nimesulide (23 32 mg/kg) itself had a potent inhibitory effect on LTD4-induced contractions.<br>
Combination of Nimesulide (23 32 mg/kg) and Cetirizine (1 16 mg/kg) had the maximum (H 90%) inhibitory action on LTD4-induced contractions (Table. 3).<br>
Discussion<br>
Cetirizine but not Nimesulide acts as a potent antihistaminic in guinea pig model of bronchoconstriction Nimesulide double dose in combination with Cetirizine shows a potent antihistaminic effect which may be due to Cetirizine alone.<br>
Hence Nimesulide itself has no antihistaminic action once histamine has been released to occupy the receptors Nevertheless, Nimesulide can have an inhibitory effect on the pre-formed allergic mediators thus having an indirect antihistaminic action<br>
Preliminary study reports suggest that Nimesulide has a highly potent anti-allergic action in antigen (egg albumin) induced bronchospastic studies. Combination of Nimesulide and Cetinzine offer a dual protection in cases of allergic asthma, as Cetirizine is a potent antihistaminic It is inferred that Nimesulide - Cetinzine combination can be used as a prophylactic for chronic allergic asthma<br>
Cetirizine and double-dose Nimesulide, both can block LTD4-induced bronchoconstnction in guinea pigs Combination of Cetirizine and Nimesulide is a very potent blocker of LTD4-mduced bronchoconstnction This effect may be due to selective inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozyme III and IV. Such inhibition has been shown substantially anti-inflammatory effects in vivo PDE4 inhibitors act by inducing an increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP which in turn suppresses inflammatory cell activity and causes relaxation of airway smooth muscles Nimesulide is reported to be a potent PDE IV inhibitor in vitro with an IC50 H 40 µM. That the combination is effectively blocking exogenously administered LTD4 implies that either Nimesulide and Cetirizine have a combined PDE III and PDE IV isozyme inhibiting capacity or Nimesulide/Cetinzine are working as LTD4 receptor antagonists<br>
The inhibition, by this combination, of the antigen-induced (egg albumin) bronchoconstnction may also be through its capacity to act as a PDE lll/IV inhibitor<br>
These preclinical results indicate the potential therapeutic efficacy of the combination of Nimesulide and Cetirizine in the treatment of allergic inflammatory airway disorders such as asthma<br>
Inference<br>
As asthma is now viewed primanly as a chronic allergic disease with an underlying inflammatory activity the ideal antiasthmatic drug should possess the following three properties<br>
Antiallergic action<br>
Anti Leukotriene action<br>
Antihistamine action<br>
Nimesulide and Cetirizine when given together posses all the three properties as<br>
is evident from the following observations<br>
1	Cetirizine (1 16 mg/kg p o) produces a decrease in % insufflation pressure<br>
by 42.86%, Nimesulide (23.32 mg/kg p o) by 61 0% whereas Nimesulide +<br>
Cetirizine synergistically decrease the pressure by<br>
80 21%  in  case  of LTD4-mduced  bronchoconstriction  in  guinea  pigs (Table. 3).<br>
2.	Cetinzine (1 16 mg/kg p o) produces a decrease in % insufflation pressure by 70 52%, Nimesulide (11 66 mg/kg p,o) by 90 24% whereas Nimesulide + Cetiriztne synergistically decrease the pressure by 96.57% in case of egg albumin induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs (Table. 2).<br>
3.	In case of histamine induced bronchoconstriction Cetinzine {1.16 mg/kg p o) decreases the % insufflation pressure by 62.71% whereas Nimesulide shows no antihistamine effect.<br>
Hence a combination of these two is required to produce a synergistic action in case of 1 and 2 as stated above In case of 3 any histamine which escapes the mast cell stabilizing action of Nimesulide and gets released would be blocked by Cetiriztne to reach the receptor sites and bronchoconstriction would be prevented.<br>
These preclinical results indicate a three pronged antiasthmatic action provided by the combination of Nimesulide and Cetinzine<br>
The inflammation associated with asthmatic decrease wilt be reduced by Nimesulide by selective COX-2 inhibition activity<br>
Therefore this invention teaches an art of treating asthma by a combination of NSAID Nimesulide alongwith an antihistamine drug Cetinzine and this combination due to a synergistically pharmacological action will have usefulness to elevate symptoms of asthmatic and related disorders in a much better fashion than the known agents for the drugs alone<br>
