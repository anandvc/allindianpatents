of distinct user interfaces. Each user interface from the plurality of distinct<br>
user interfaces can be adapted to configure a corresponding software<br>
application from a plurality of software applications associated with operating<br>
a programmable logic controller (PLC).<br>
[26] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system 1000,<br>
which can comprise a PLC 1100. PLC 1100 can comprise a circuit 1120.<br>
 <br>
Circuit 1120 can be adapted to automatically perform any method or activity<br>
described herein. For example, circuit 1120 can be adapted to<br>
communicatively couple PLC 1100 to a first chain of modules 1040, which<br>
can comprise a first module 1200, a second module 1300, and a third module<br>
1400. First module 1200, second module 1300, and third module 1400 can be<br>
communicatively coupled in a series arrangement. Each adjacent pair of first<br>
chain of modules 1040, such as first module 1200 and second module 1300<br>
can be communicatively coupled in series. Each of first module 1200. second<br>
module 1300, and third module 1400 can be, and/or can be referred to as, I/O<br>
modules and/or I/O expansion modules, which can each be communicatively<br>
coupled to a corresponding plurality of sensors, such as a first sensor 1240, a<br>
second sensor 1340, and a third sensor 1440. Each of first module 1200,<br>
second module 1300, and third module 1400 can be communicatively coupled<br>
to a corresponding plurality of actuators such as a first actuator 1280, a second<br>
actuator 1380, and a third actuator 1480. Each of first module 1200, second<br>
module 1300, and/or third module 1400 can be adapted to communicate with<br>
PLC 1100 in hard real-time.<br>
[27] PLC 1100 can be communicatively coupled to a second chain of modules<br>
1080, which can comprise a fourth module 1500, a fifth module 1600, and a<br>
sixth module 1700, which can be communicatively coupled in a series<br>
arrangement. Each adjacent pair of second chain of modules 1080, such as<br>
fourth module 1500 and fifth module 1600 can be communicatively coupled in<br>
series. Fourth module 1500, fifth module 1600, and sixth module 1700 can<br>
be, and/or can be referred to as, communications modules and/or annex<br>
modules, each of which can be communicatively coupled to a plurality of<br>
information devices, such as an information device 1540 (illustrated as being<br>
communicatively coupled to fourth module 1500).<br>
[28] Programmable logic controllers can be used for monitoring parameters and/or<br>
controlling devices. Certain exemplary systems can incorporate one or more<br>
sensors, such as first sensor 1240, second sensor 1340, and third sensor 1440,<br>
which can be communicatively coupled to a PLC 1100. Certain exemplary<br>
systems can comprise devices controllable by the PLC, such as first actuator<br>
 <br>
1280, a second actuator 1380, and a third actuator 1480. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, PLC 1100 can communicate with sensors and/or controlled<br>
devices via one or more input/output (I/O) buses.<br>
[29] In certain exemplary embodiments, system 1000 and/or a device<br>
communicatively coupled thereto can comprise circuit 1120 and/or a user<br>
interface renderer 1140. Circuit 1120 and/or user interface Tenderer 1140 can<br>
be adapted to cause a plurality of distinct user interfaces to be rendered. Each<br>
user interface from the plurality of distinct user interfaces can be adapted to<br>
configure a corresponding software application from a plurality of software<br>
applications associated with controlling and/or operating a programmable<br>
logic controller (PLC). User interface renderer 1140 can be adapted to change<br>
at least one of the plurality of distinct user interfaces responsive to an<br>
automatic detection of access rights associated with the user. At least one of<br>
the plurality of distinct user interfaces can be adapted to cause an automatic<br>
comparison of at least one value of a received configuration input to a<br>
predetermined value and/or a predetermined range of values. User interface<br>
renderer 1140 can be adapted to initially render one of the plurality of user<br>
interfaces responsive to a placement of a corresponding icon of a<br>
hierarchically-organized instruction tree in proximity to and/or in an editor<br>
and/or a rendered editor icon. User interface renderer 1140 can be adapted to<br>
provide a subsequent rendering of the user interface that comprises values<br>
modified via the configuration input.<br>
[30] At least one of the plurality of distinct user interfaces can be adapted to cause<br>
an automatic generation of a proportional/integral/derivative (PID) control<br>
procedure. The proportional/integral/derivative (PID) control procedure can<br>
be adapted to be executed by PLC 1100. At least one of the plurality of<br>
distinct user interfaces can be adapted to cause an automatic generation of a<br>
high-speed counting procedure and/or a high speed control procedure. The<br>
high-speed counting procedure and/or the high speed control procedure can be<br>
adapted to be executed by PLC 1100. At least one of the plurality of distinct<br>
user interfaces can be adapted to cause an automatic configuration of one or<br>
more non-PLC devices, such as first module 1200, second module 1300, third<br>
 <br>
module 1400, fourth module 1500, fifth module 1600, and sixth module 1700,<br>
one or more of which can be communicatively coupled to PLC 1100. One or<br>
more of first module 1200, second module 1300, third module 1400, fourth<br>
module 1500, fifth module 1600, and sixth module 1700 can be a<br>
communication module. At least one of the plurality of distinct user interfaces<br>
can be adapted to cause an automatic generation of a report indicative of<br>
automatically determined differences between a first version of the control<br>
program and a second version of the control program of the PLC.<br>
[31] For a selected software application from the plurality of software applications,<br>
user interface renderer 1140 can be adapted to automatically provide a first<br>
user interface if the PLC is executing a control program and a second user<br>
interface if the PLC is not executing the control program. The selected<br>
software application can be selected based upon a specified configuration.<br>
User interface renderer 1140 might not use a PLC language editor to configure<br>
the selected software application. The selected software application can be<br>
adapted to be referenced via an automatically rendered hierarchically-<br>
organized instruction tree. The instruction tree can be indicative of an<br>
organized structure associated with available PLC machine instructions. The<br>
first user interface can be adapted to provide a current set of configuration<br>
parameters associated with the selected software application. The first user<br>
interface can be adapted to receive a configuration input from the user.<br>
Responsive to the configuration input, the first user interface can be adapted to<br>
change one or more configuration parameters from the current set of<br>
configuration parameters. The second user interface can be adapted to<br>
facilitate debugging the selected software application. The second user<br>
interface can be adapted to receive a debugging input from a user.<br>
[32] User interface renderer 1140 can be adapted to render each of the plurality of<br>
user interfaces responsive to meta-data obtained from a hierarchical<br>
representation of the plurality of software applications, such as meta-data<br>
associated with a hierarchical tree. User interface renderer 1140 can be<br>
adapted to be modified to add at least one user interface to the plurality of user<br>
interfaces without changing a control program of the PLC.<br>
 <br>
[33] In certain exemplary embodiments, one or more of first module 1200, second<br>
module 1300, third module 1400, fourth module 1500, fifth module 1600, and<br>
sixth module 1700 can be adapted to be configured via one of the plurality of<br>
distinct user interfaces.<br>
[34] In certain exemplary embodiments, system 1000 and/or a device<br>
communicatively coupled thereto can comprise a software generator 1160.<br>
Software generator 1160 can be adapted to automatically generate a PLC<br>
application responsive to information provided via at least one of the plurality<br>
of user interfaces.<br>
[35] PLCs can be used to solve complex application tasks. Exemplary application<br>
tasks can comprise:<br>
[36] In proportional/integral/derivative (PID) control, PID loops can be<br>
used in applications adapted to control a certain measurement to a<br>
predetermined setpoint. Examples of PID control can comprise<br>
maintaining control of a temperature and/or maintaining a constant<br>
flow rate. A PID algorithm can be adapted to measure current values<br>
of a variable being controlled and automatically adjust control<br>
parameters in an attempt to maintain a consistent temperature and/or<br>
flow.<br>
[37] In certain exemplary manufacturing operations, a high speed count<br>
might be desired of often require the measurement of events that occur<br>
at very high speeds. When the count reaches a certain value, certain<br>
applications can be adapted to control one or more variables in a<br>
process. Certain exemplary embodiments can be adapted to measure<br>
and/or count electrical pulses at a rate of approximately 200 kilohertz<br>
or approximately every 5 microseconds. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, relatively high speed operations can be counted and/or<br>
controlled.<br>
[38] Certain exemplary embodiments can be adapted to communicate with<br>
one or more non-PLC devices employed to assist in automation related<br>
 <br>
tasks. Certain exemplary embodiments can support custom<br>
communication protocols. For example, weigh scales, temperature<br>
transmitters, differential transmitters, ink-jet printers, and/or vision<br>
systems can each communicate with a specific, custom communication<br>
protocol. In order for the PLC to communicate to these types of<br>
devices, the PLC can be adapted to communicate with each custom<br>
protocol. Certain exemplary embodiments can support Freeport<br>
communications. Utilizing Freeport communications, a PLC<br>
application of a customer can be developed to control a communication<br>
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART). In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, the UART can be configured and/or<br>
controlled consistent with a custom communication protocol of a<br>
unique device.<br>
[39] In certain exemplary embodiments, a custom PLC application control program<br>
can be developed to take advantage of a generic capability provided by the<br>
PLC. The application program can be customer created software that controls<br>
electrical inputs and outputs of the PLC.<br>
[40] Application control programs created by a customer can be relatively<br>
complex. Setting up a configuration within the PLC can be relatively<br>
complex. Engineering Station (ES) software, such as Step-7 or Step-7 Micro-<br>
WIN, and/or a user interface renderer can be adapted to provide a view and<br>
interface to the customer into the PLC. The ES can be adapted for a user to<br>
configure the PLC and/or create a custom application program.<br>
[41] The ES can be adapted for the customer to create applications using the above<br>
capabilities. In some instances, such as Freeport, the customer can program<br>
the actual PLC memory locations in order to utilize the capability. In other<br>
cases, application wizards might be provided via the user interface renderer to<br>
help moderate the complexity of creating these applications.<br>
[42] For some control tasks, a customer can configure certain variables, such as<br>
those shown below in Table I specifically through application code. Once a<br>
 <br>
configuration is complete, the customer can insert programming instructions<br>
into the application code in order to initiate one or more desired operations.<br>
For Freeport, these instructions might be named XMT (Transmit) and RCV<br>
(Receive).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[43] For other control tasks, configuration capabilities can be provided in the form<br>
of wizards (i.e. graphical user interfaces). Wizards can be adapted to assist the<br>
customer to configure the application. An as example, a portion of the PED<br>
wizard is illustrated in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.<br>
 <br>
[44] FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 are exemplary user interfaces. A wizard can be executed<br>
independently, separately from a corresponding application program. The<br>
configuration created by executing this wizard can be visible within this form.<br>
The configuration might not be visible from a context of the application<br>
program. In certain exemplary embodiments, a first user interface, such as the<br>
user interface of FIG. 2 can be provided for configuration of an exemplary<br>
PHD control. Responsive to one or more user inputs, the user interface of FIG.<br>
3 can be provided, via which a user can provide additional inputs related to the<br>
PID control.<br>
[45] FIG. 4 is an exemplary user interface, which can comprise an instruction tree<br>
3100. As a result, when an instruction is dropped from an ES instruction tree<br>
into a selected editor, such as editor 3200, a configuration might not be visible.<br>
The configuration can be accessible separately from the wizard.<br>
[46] In certain exemplary embodiments, the application programming and<br>
configuration of complex application tasks can be simplified in relative terms.<br>
Complex application tasks can be implemented and configured through the<br>
"Smart Clients" and the configuration can be accomplished via instructions.<br>
[47] Certain exemplary embodiments permit dropping an instruction into an editor<br>
and causing the configuration by double-clicking upon the instruction. This<br>
sequence is illustrated below in FIG. 5.<br>
[48] FIG. 5 is an exemplary set of user interfaces 5000, which can comprise an<br>
instruction tree 5100 and an editor 5200. Via instruction tree 5100 and/or<br>
editor 5200, a predetermined set of distinct user interfaces, such as first user<br>
interface 5300, second user interface 5400, and third user interface 5500 can<br>
be provided and/or rendered to a user. The opening of an instance of an<br>
instruction can be context sensitive. When double-clicking upon the<br>
instruction while performing program edits, the configuration context can be<br>
activated, as illustrated in FIG. 5. Responsive to user inputs provided via first<br>
user interface 5300, second user interface 5400, and third user interface 5500,<br>
 <br>
an instruction tree context can change, which can result in one or more visible<br>
or invisible changes to instruction tree user 5100.<br>
[49] FIG. 6 is an exemplary user interface that corresponds to first user interface<br>
S300 of FIG. 5. FIG. 7 is an exemplary user interface that corresponds to first<br>
user interface S400 of FIG. 5. FIG. 8 is an exemplary user interface that<br>
corresponds to first user interface 5500 of FIG. 5.<br>
[50] FIG. 9 is an exemplary set of user interfaces 9000, which can comprise a first<br>
user interface 9000 and a second user interface 9200. User interface 9000 can<br>
comprise an instruction icon 9100. In certain exemplary embodiments, when<br>
double-clicking upon instruction icon 9100 while performing program<br>
debugging, the displayed context can be different than when not performing<br>
debugging. FIG. 10 is an exemplary user interface that corresponds to user<br>
interface 9100 of FIG. 9, which can be illustrative of a user interface provided<br>
during debugging. User interface 9100 can comprise a trend chart indicative<br>
of performance of one or more application programs related to the debugging.<br>
[51] Certain exemplary embodiments can, in relative terms, simplify the<br>
customer's configuration of complex application tasks by providing context<br>
sensitive, user interface elements that graphically lead the customer through<br>
the configuration process.<br>
[52] Certain exemplary embodiments can associate a particular configuration with<br>
each instance of a given application "Smart Client". Double-clicking upon<br>
each instance of "Smart Client" can provide a context sensitive, user interface<br>
environment that can be adapted to assist in configuring or debugging the<br>
user's application.<br>
[53] Smart Client Customization can define a means to customize one or more<br>
standard functionalities by adding so called Smart Clients to a system. From a<br>
user's point-of-view these Smart Clients can be qualified by either of the<br>
following: Smart Clients can be objects that augment standard functionality<br>
provided by Step 7+; and/or Smart Clients can be objects that provide a<br>
simplified user interface to the customer.<br>
 <br>
[54] From the system's point-of-view, Smart Clients can be extensions of standard<br>
Step 7+ objects that provide extra functionality. Smart Client Customization<br>
can specify a collection of rules and/or recommendations that can be adapted<br>
to enable a developer to add extra system functionality. Examples of such<br>
extra functionality can comprise:<br>
[55] grouping of specialized configuration sequences such as PID<br>
controllers. High Speed Counters, or hardware modules;<br>
[56] improved rendering and representation such as graphical display of<br>
controller settings instead of a table view of instance DB values; and/or<br>
[57] additional configuration rules such as checking and enforcing instance<br>
values between certain ranges or calculating instance values based<br>
upon customer specified configurations, etc.<br>
[58] Within the language editors, Smart Clients might be used in rung or network<br>
programming. Certain exemplary embodiments can utilize a call to a block<br>
that comprises the functionality of the Smart Client. These instances can<br>
utilize:<br>
[59] instantiation of a new Smart Client instance;<br>
[60] instance modification of a Smart Client's configuration; and/or<br>
[61 ] instance visualization of a Smart Client's online state, etc.<br>
[62] The instantiation of such Smart Clients can comprise:<br>
[63] dragging and dropping a Smart Client from an instruction list or task<br>
card into the rung or network; and/or<br>
[64] filling in any configuration or parameterization property page, etc.<br>
[65] This can result in a call (or inline code) and further data or objects (blocks)<br>
comprising an exemplary operation for this instance of the Smart Client. The<br>
following figure illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a procedure, a PCD<br>
controller provided as such a Smart Client might perform, when instantiated.<br>
[66] A modification of a Smart Client instance can comprise one or more of the<br>
following steps:<br>
 <br>
[67] the instance in question can be opened (by double click or context<br>
menu or appropriate action); and/or<br>
[68] instead of starting a block editor, the Smart Client can be invoked to<br>
re-run configuration, etc.<br>
[69] This can result in a modification on the call or further data or objects<br>
representing the instance of FIG. 5.<br>
[70] An instance visualization of a Smart Client can comprise one or more of the<br>
following steps:<br>
[71] the instance in question can be opened for visualization (by the<br>
appropriate action); and/or<br>
[72] instead of starting a block editor, the Smart Client can perform its<br>
specific instance visualization, etc.<br>
[73] This can result in the Smart Client's specific visualization functionality to be<br>
performed as illustrated in FIG. 9.<br>
[74] Whether the particular instance will be opened for online visualization or for<br>
offline visualization can be determined by the editor's current state. If the<br>
editor is in online state when opening the instance for visualization, the Smart<br>
Client can be asked to conduct online visualization. If the editor is in offline<br>
state, offline visualization can be initiated.<br>
[75] Within hardware configuration editors, Smart Clients can be used to configure<br>
built-in central processing unit (CPU) features such as high-speed counter<br>
configuration or external hardware modules such as Internet modules. Certain<br>
exemplary embodiments can configure hardware modules that might be too<br>
complicated to be supported by master device description(s) (MDD) or generic<br>
station description (GSD) configurations alone. Master device description(s)<br>
and generic station description can describe capabilities of an individual<br>
hardware device.<br>
[76] FIG. 11 is an exemplary user interface that can be adapted to obtain<br>
information from a user which can be used to configure a module of a PLC<br>
 <br>
system. The user interface can prompt a user to provide an IP address, a<br>
subnet mask, a gateway address, and/or a module connection type associated<br>
with the module. In certain exemplary embodiments, information obtained via<br>
the user interface can be used to configure the module and/or<br>
communicatively couple the module to the PLC system.<br>
[77] A Smart Client can offer programmatic support for a developer. Certain<br>
exemplary embodiments can utilize one or more of:<br>
[78] instantiation;<br>
[79] instance modification; and/or<br>
[80] instance visualization (online), etc.<br>
[81] The instantiation of a Smart Client can be performed by a drag and drop from<br>
a module list (task card showing available modules) into the hardware<br>
configuration pane. Certain exemplary embodiments can comprise property<br>
pages adapted to specify the module's parameterization. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can provide a device parameterization of the specific device or<br>
module.<br>
[82] Modification of Smart Client instances can comprise one or more of the<br>
following steps:<br>
[83] the module instance can be opened (by double click or context menu or<br>
appropriate action); and/or<br>
[84] the Smart Client can be invoked to re-run module configuration /<br>
parameterization, etc.<br>
[85] Certain exemplary embodiments can provide a modified device configuration.<br>
An instantiation visualization of module-related Smart Clients can comprise<br>
one or more of the following steps:<br>
[86] the instance in question can be opened (by double click or context<br>
menu or appropriate action); and/or<br>
[87] the Smart Client can be invoked to perform its specific module<br>
visualization, etc.<br>
 <br>
[88] Certain exemplary embodiments can provide a Smart Client's specific<br>
visualization functionality.<br>
[89] For some Smart Clients, a type of context-less use can comprise wizard type<br>
operations. Such a wizard might be designed to generate an entire program or<br>
hardware configuration and can be started without a specific context to a<br>
selected object. Instead the wizard can interrogate the context prior to starting.<br>
[90] FIG. 12 is an exemplary user interface, which can be adapted to receive one or<br>
more inputs from the user related to configuring alarms associated with the<br>
PLC system. The user interface can comprise a plurality of logical buttons<br>
and/or input fields associated with configuring the alarms.<br>
[91] Certain exemplary embodiments can be integrated into the Platform by the<br>
addition of a Main Menu entry named "Tools" or "Wizards". In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, a menu can comprise a list of currently installed<br>
Smart Clients. Upon activation, certain exemplary Smart Clients can<br>
determine their operating context.<br>
[92] The following can be a set of Smart Client characteristics for certain<br>
exemplary embodiments. These are services that might be utilized by add-on<br>
client applications or controls in order to perform specific, value-added<br>
customization.<br>
[93] Access Objects and Services Access to STEP 7+ project related services.<br>
These services can comprise one or more of the following:<br>
[94] an ability to programmatically create certain types of blocks (OB, DB,<br>
system data block (SDB), FC, function block (FB);<br>
[95] an ability to programmatically delete certain types of blocks (OB, DB,<br>
SDB, FC, FB);<br>
[96] an ability to specify and modify block properties comprising block<br>
privileges (read only, hidden, etc.);<br>
[97] an ability to programmatically generate and manage tag references;<br>
[98] an ability to programmatically generate and manage variable table;<br>
and/or<br>
 <br>
[99] certain object types represented within the object frame can be<br>
accessible, etc.<br>
[100] Regarding custom client objects, it might be desired that language-related<br>
Smart Clients have a similar appearance and behave in a similar manner tc<br>
typical box instructions in both the instruction tree and editor.<br>
[101] Regarding instruction properties certain exemplary embodiments can<br>
distinguish a Smart Client from a normal box instruction to indicate that<br>
additional configuration might be utilized in associated property pages. This<br>
could be accomplished by including custom icons in the instruction tree and<br>
some other distinguishing characteristic within the instruction in the editor.<br>
[102] Regarding instruction encoding and code generation, it might be desired that<br>
language-related Smart Clients behave as native box instructions. However,<br>
the code that is generated for these instructions can be inline code and/or code<br>
contained within an FC or FB. For example, the PID Smart Instruction can<br>
create a cyclic execution OB which can execute the actual PID instruction.<br>
Additional scheduling code can be added to separate execution of different<br>
PID instructions across different PLC scans.<br>
[103] Smart Clients can be able to persistently store information configured by a<br>
customer. Custom objects can be able to integrate with other standard services<br>
such as cross-reference, printing, undo, redo, find/replace, etc. Custom clients<br>
can be able to perform offline and online reads and writes of DBs and IDBs<br>
members. Today in STEP 7, symbol names for customer-defined functions<br>
(FBs, FCs) can be unique. This also comprises data blocks (DBs). In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, symbolic references of FCs/FBs and DBs can have<br>
the same name. This can allow any DBs used internally within a FC or with a<br>
FB to be visually associated since the symbolic reference might be exactly the<br>
same. Language-related Smart Clients can appear in the instruction tree just<br>
as native instructions. However, dropping these instructions might result in a<br>
FC or FB being instantiated into the project. When FCs or FBs are used,<br>
dropping of the instruction might generate a unique instance name.<br>
 <br>
Additionally, the Smart Client designer might be adapted for a customer to<br>
specify a custom name.<br>
[104] Uploads can re-create certain Smart Client objects. Upon uploading into a<br>
new project. Smart Clients can be re-configured through their associated<br>
property pages. Exporting and subsequent importing can also re-create all<br>
Smart Client objects. Upon importing into a new project, Smart Clients can be<br>
able to be re-configured through their associated property pages. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, visual representation of language-related Smart<br>
Clients can display information configured through property pages. Certain<br>
important information can be displayed without having to instantiate the<br>
property pages. Certain exemplary embodiments can comprise information<br>
inside the box instruction or within a specialized type of tooltip. A Smart<br>
Client can augment the Platform and/or other editor's context menus.<br>
[105] In certain exemplary embodiments, language-related Smart Client program<br>
can display information configured through property pages. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, information can be displayed without having to<br>
instantiate the property pages. This might be accomplished by including<br>
important information inside box instruction or within a specialized type of<br>
tooltip. In certain exemplary embodiments, current hardware configuration<br>
can be accessible from Smart Clients. In certain exemplary embodiments, the<br>
instruction to present configuration options can be based upon currently<br>
configured hardware. An example of this might be peer-to-peer<br>
communication instructions. These instructions might offer network<br>
selections for hardware that is currently configured.<br>
[106] Smart Clients can support Cut/Copy/Paste (CCP). When these operations are<br>
performed on Smart Clients, certain associated project components of the<br>
Smart Clients can be managed. Project components can vary depending upon<br>
the Smart Clients. These might be inline code, FCs, or FBs. Cut operations<br>
can delete the Smart Client and its associated components. However, there<br>
might be more than one instance of a Smart Client that also has references to<br>
existing components, copy and paste operations can vary depending upon the<br>
 <br>
Smart Client. Inline code can be copied. FCs and FBs can copy the call to the<br>
block. Smart Clients can support undo and redo operations. When these<br>
operations are performed on language-related Smart Clients, associated project<br>
components can be added and/or removed. Undo &amp; redo operations can be<br>
supported as a result of modifications to the existing Smart Client<br>
configuration. Instance modifications might be undoable events. Smart<br>
Clients can support Internationalization for user interface relevant components<br>
(dialogs, messages, help...). Certain exemplary embodiments can extend the<br>
software interface to satisfy future desires. Compatibility to existing clients<br>
can be maintained.<br>
[107] FIG. 13 is an exemplary user interface, which can comprise program editor<br>
13100 with a task card comprising an editor's instruction tree 13200. An<br>
editor's task card can comprise supported objects. Instructions can be<br>
arranged and assorted regardless of how the instructions are implemented.<br>
Instructions implemented as inline MC7 instructions, FCs, FBs, SFCs, SFCs,<br>
and/or Smart Clients can appear as normal instructions. Smart Clients can be<br>
visually distinct. Such a distinction can be utilized to visually identify<br>
instructions, in both the tree and the editor that might utilize additional<br>
configuration performed through some type of special "Guided Configuration"<br>
approach.<br>
[108] Smart Clients can be comprised within the editor's task card during<br>
installation through the use of meta-data. Categorization within the instruction<br>
tree can also be specified through the meta-data. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can comprise a common, generalized method to add Smart<br>
Clients to multiple editors with a single description.<br>
[109] A Smart Client task card object can be instantiated during the creation of the<br>
task card. These Smart Client task card objects can comprise meta-data that<br>
describe the characteristics of the instruction. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments might not utilize instructions added during run-time.<br>
 <br>
[110] Language-related Smart Clients can provide the following information for an<br>
editor (or any other hosting business logic):<br>
[ill]<br>
 <br>
[112] Instantiation can occur when an action is performed that inserts a Smart Client<br>
into the respective editor area. A new Smart Client instance can be created.<br>
[113] However, the methodology used to create the new Smart Client instance can<br>
be abstracted from the editor. The editor might have no explicit knowledge or<br>
binding regarding the type of Smart Client. This knowledge might only be<br>
known by a class or subclass that has an association with the Smart Client.<br>
[114] This can be accomplished architecturally through the use of some type of<br>
creational factory pattern. Some variation of factory, abstract factory, or<br>
builder patterns might be sufficient.<br>
[115] Creational factory patterns can abstract the creation of objects to an interface'<br>
or subclass that understands the class that might be created. Certain<br>
 <br>
exemplary embodiments can permit the editor to call a single factory method<br>
that might be responsible for instantiating different types of Smart Clients.<br>
[116] FIG. 14 is an exemplary user interface, which can comprise an instruction tree<br>
14100. An icon, such as a PID icon 14200 can be dragged in a user interface<br>
by a user to an editor 14300, which can cause a generation of one or more user<br>
interfaces associated with configuring PID control.<br>
[l17] Insertion of a Smart Client into an editor can occur in multiple ways. Once<br>
placed within the editor, the editor can create a "new" instance of the Smart<br>
Client using the supplied factory. Certain exemplary embodiments can call a<br>
factory supplied CreateInstance method. The factory supplied CreateInstance<br>
method can be adapted to call the Createlnstance method of the particular<br>
Smart Client to instantiate a new instance.<br>
[118] Instantiation of Smart Clients might be accomplished without the editor<br>
having any explicit knowledge of the Smart Client instance being created.<br>
Exemplary pseudo-code is illustrated below.<br>
[119] SmartClientFactory SCFactory = new SCFactory();<br>
[120] ...<br>
[121] //ISmartClient was previously declared as an interface<br>
[122] ISmartClient MySCInstance;<br>
[I23] SCFactory.CreateInstance(MyDev, Type, SubType, MySCInstance);<br>
[124] The program editor can be associated with instantiated Smart Clients.<br>
However, the editor might have no real knowledge of the Smart Client's<br>
capabilities and behaviors. Whenever one of the actions referenced within the<br>
ISmartClient interface occurs, the editor can call the appropriate<br>
implementation provided by the given Smart Client. For example, if a<br>
customer hovers over the above instantiated Smart Client, the editor can call<br>
the following ToolTip method:<br>
[125] MySCInstance.ToolTip(Block2Call, ToolTipStream);<br>
 <br>
[126] The system can be adapted to display the tool tip with a returned<br>
"ToolTipStream" stream. Smart Clients can be software additions that<br>
provide new functionality beyond the standard Platform environment. Certain<br>
exemplary participating editors (program and hardware configuration) use the<br>
displayed interfaces to provide control to the Smart Client implementations.<br>
Smart Clients can provide functionality associated with a task that they are<br>
designed to provide.<br>
[127] Certain exemplary Smart Clients can interact with the platform through<br>
standard external interfaces provided by the scripting object model. Standard<br>
functionality provided by the Platform or other Business Logic can be<br>
accessed by an external client through the scripting interfaces.<br>
[128] The changes initiated by Smart Clients using scripting can be automatically<br>
reflected within the editor's views by standard "On Change" notification<br>
mechanisms. These mechanisms can be provided by existing relationships<br>
between the Object Frame and the various editor's business logic.<br>
[129] Smart Client developers can be responsible to attempt to make new additions<br>
work properly and reliably with the platform. Certain exemplary Smart<br>
Clients can be extensions to standard products and can be relatively reliable.<br>
[130] FIG. 15 is a block diagram of an exemplary system 15000, which can<br>
comprise an illustrative flow related to application development. System<br>
15000 can comprise one or more editors 15100, a smart client factory 15200,<br>
one or more smart clients 15300, and a scripting object 15400.<br>
[131] Certain exemplary Smart Clients can expose particular interfaces that hosting<br>
business logic (i.e. editors, hardware configuration) might use to initiate<br>
execution of functionality provided by the Smart Client.<br>
[132] An [SmartClient interface can be a controlling interface used by participating<br>
editors. Certain exemplary embodiments can be implemented by the Smart<br>
Client in order to provide functionality that is unique to respective Smart<br>
Clients.<br>
 <br>
[133] The editor can call methods within this interface in order to invoke additional<br>
functionality provided by the Smart Clients. For example, to instantiate a new<br>
Smart Client object can invoke a "CreateInstance" method and to edit the<br>
configuration then can invoke an "Editlnstance" method. Exemplary<br>
pseudocode follows:<br>
[134] Public interface ISmartClient<br>
1135] {<br>
[136] int Createlnstance ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase,	<br>
[137] [in] int Type,<br>
[138] [in] int SubType,<br>
[139] Tout] ISmartClient MyInstance );<br>
[140] int Editlnstance ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[141] int EditType ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[142] int VisualizeInstanceOffline ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[143] int VisualizeInstanceOnline ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[ 144] int RunWizard ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[145] int CheckConsistency ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[146] int Delete ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[147] int Copy ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[148] int Paste ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase );<br>
[149] int Help ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase);<br>
[150] int Print ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase,<br>
[151] [in, out] Stream DataStream);<br>
[152] int ToolTip ( [in] IScriptObject IHomeBase,<br>
[153] [in, out] Stream DataStream);<br>
[154] }<br>
[155] Certain exemplary Smart Clients can be associated with program editors.<br>
These language-related Smart Clients can be adapted to perform operations<br>
consistent with existing language editors.<br>
[156] Certain exemplary Smart Clients can incorporate user interface behaviors<br>
adapted to support internationalization elements, which can comprise support<br>
for both language settings and regional options.<br>
 <br>
[157] Certain exemplary Smart Clients can use a "Guided Configuration" approach.<br>
Opening an instance of a Smart Client can initiate a "Guided Configuration".<br>
The type and complexity of the configuration might vary depending upon the<br>
client.<br>
[158] Upon completion of client configuration, various components and/or values<br>
may be inserted into the program. These program components can represent<br>
the execution characteristics of a successfully configured Smart Client. These<br>
components can be any combination of object blocks (OBs), (instance data<br>
block) IDBs, function calls (FCs), function blocks (FBs), system function calls<br>
(SFCs), and/or system function blocks (SFBs), etc. Executable code can be<br>
comprised in separate, unique blocks or might be generated inline.<br>
[1S9] Certain components might also be shared. For example, one common first<br>
scan OB might be used by multiple language-related Smart Clients that utilize<br>
first scan initializations. Each respective Smart Client can add separate<br>
networks into the same first scan OB, which can permit minimal resource<br>
usage since only one first scan block is used for a plurality of Smart Clients.<br>
[160] The type and organization of these components might be the responsibility of<br>
the Smart Client designer. Certain exemplary embodiments can be available<br>
to the Smart Client designer.<br>
[161] The editor can inquire from the Smart Client whether it has been successfully<br>
configured. In certain exemplary embodiments, the Smart Client might know<br>
if the customer has completed certain exemplary configurations. Checking the<br>
consistency can also permit Smart Clients to perform certain verifications of<br>
proprietary components, which might be performed during a compilation or<br>
before a download.<br>
[162] In certain exemplary embodiments, language editors can comprise a means to<br>
edit the type of a call's instance by starting from the call's instance. Since<br>
Smart Clients in language editors are sometimes calls and might be<br>
implemented as such, in certain exemplary embodiments a callback can be<br>
 <br>
provided for "Smart Clients". A Smart Client can provide a means to alter or<br>
modify a dialog procedure according to user's specification. The specific<br>
action to be performed by a particular Smart Client might be determined by<br>
the "Smart Client" designer.<br>
[163] The RunWizard call is a potential callback, which might not be provided by an<br>
editor. In certain exemplary embodiments, RunWizard can initiate the Smart<br>
Clients' contextless operation. The Workbench can be extended to provide a<br>
call embedded into an interface adapted for use by a user. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can comprise an extras menu "RunSmartClient", which can be<br>
adapted to show certain installed Smart Clients. Upon selection the selected<br>
Smart Client can be instantiated and receive a RunWizard callback.<br>
[164] A "Delete" operation can be adapted to delete an editor's instruction instance<br>
and/or related components. The delete method can be called when an instance<br>
of a Smart Client is deleted. The delete operation can occur in many different<br>
ways (e.g., delete instruction, delete rung, etc.). In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, the delete call can be executed regardless of how the instruction<br>
was deleted.<br>
[165] Deletion of a Smart Client instance can cause a deletion of certain associated<br>
components. Any component shared by more than one Smart Client can be<br>
referenced counted and/or deleted when no other instance of the Smart Client<br>
is using the component. In certain exemplary embodiments, the Smart Client<br>
can delete components.<br>
[166] For blocks shared by more than one Smart Client, one option instead of using<br>
reference counting might be to examine the number of networks within the<br>
block. When the number reaches 0, the block might be deleted.<br>
[167] A copy operation can copy a core object and places the core object in a<br>
clipboard. This object type can be a standard object model type and can be<br>
managed during future paste operations.<br>
 <br>
[168] In addition to the standard copy operation, the editor might invoke the Smart<br>
Client's copy operation, which can be adapted to augment the standard copy<br>
operation. The Smart Client might be adapted to comprise additional<br>
proprietary information into the clipboard which might be used during a<br>
subsequent paste operation.<br>
[169] The editor's Paste can insert the Smart Client previously copied into the<br>
clipboard at the current editor position. In addition to mis standard paste<br>
operation, the editor can invoke the Smart Client's paste operation. The Smart<br>
Client can be adapted to read a part of information out of the clipboard and<br>
might perform one or more predetermined tasks, which might augment the<br>
standard paste operation. For example, the Smart Client might perform a<br>
reference count of the number of instances. This might be used to delete a<br>
Smart Client's project components when the reference count is reduced to<br>
zero.<br>
[170] Smart Clients can provide support for customized user assistance through the<br>
provision of custom help topics. A Smart Client's help provision might be a<br>
separate one, which might not be integrated into the editor's help. Upon mis<br>
call a Smart Client can obtain the current internationalization setting, then<br>
display help information in this language (or fall back to a default language)<br>
and eventually return control back to the editor.<br>
[171] Smart Clients can be adapted to generate a formatted representation of their<br>
individual configuration that might be used for printing. The Smart Clients<br>
can provide formatted information to the program editor for printing.<br>
[172] Format of the configuration can be provided by the Smart Client designer.<br>
This format might vary depending upon each Smart Client. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can conform to standard printing usability styles. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments editors first print their own information and then<br>
append any Smart Clients' additional print pages.<br>
 <br>
[173] Smart Clients can be adapted to generate a custom, formatted tool tip. This<br>
tool tip can be used to display various pieces of information about the Smart<br>
Client. Information can comprise one or more of the following:<br>
[174] the title of the instruction;<br>
[175] an abbreviated helpful description of the instruction;<br>
[176] the set of desired configuration parameters along with their values;<br>
[177] a listing of the instruction prototypes IN, OUT, and IN/OUT<br>
parameters; and/or<br>
[178] an optional user supplied comment. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, a predetermined number of characters can be displayed.<br>
[179] The tool tip might become visible whenever the cursor is hovering inside a<br>
complete box instruction. Certain exemplary embodiments might not provide<br>
a specific tool tip sensitive sub-areas within an instruction.<br>
[180] Internationalization support can be provided.<br>
[181] FIG. 16 is an exemplary user interface, which can indicate information related<br>
to a data transfer from a remote PLC to a device associated with a specified<br>
local address. The user interface can provide information, as illustrated, that<br>
can comprise identities of a port, a remote station, remote buffer, and/or local<br>
buffer, etc.<br>
[182] A Smart Client might show the current values of configured items. These<br>
values can be determined using data reads.<br>
[183] In online visualization a Smart Client can be adapted to plot current values. In<br>
order for online plotting or repeated value display to go on smoothly, an<br>
asynchronous data read capability might be adequate. If scripting cannot<br>
provide for online plotting or repeated value display, a poll read as laid out<br>
following can be utilized.<br>
[184] A read flagged as poll read can return immediately with an indication if data<br>
were available and hence might have been provided or not. If a read did not<br>
provide any data, the Smart Client might nap for a predetermined time span<br>
 <br>
before repeating a read attempt. To avoid excessive system load factors, a nap<br>
of at least 50 Milliseconds might be conducted. Longer naps might be<br>
utilized.<br>
[185] A separate VisualizelnstanceOffline can be provided for a Smart Client, which<br>
can be adapted to comprise an instance value display and possible tuning for<br>
an offline side. Such tuned instance values can be stored in an offline<br>
database (DB) and can be subsequently downloaded.<br>
[186] In editors, there might be a user-addressable function "VisualizeInstance". If<br>
the editor is in an online mode at the time the user selects it, the Smart Client<br>
can be called via VisualizeInstanceOnline. If the editor is in offline mode, the<br>
Smart Client can be called via VisualizelnstanceOffline. Internationalization<br>
support can be provided for both functions.<br>
[187] An IScriptObject interface can be provided to access platform services<br>
exposed by a scripting object model. IScriptObject can be an interface for an<br>
abstracted "Object Frame" object. This interface can be cast to any<br>
specializations derived from an "Object Frame". These specializations might<br>
be defined in an object model of certain exemplary embodiments.<br>
[188] In certain exemplary embodiments, the Smart Client might understand the<br>
type of object(s) for an exemplary implementation. Upon activation of certain<br>
exemplary methods, each Smart Client can be adapted to cast and verify that a<br>
provided interface is compatible with an implementation. The following is an<br>
example of pseudocode for a Smart Client to perform a cast to a Deviceltem:<br>
[189] Deviceltem device = (IHomeBase as DevicItem);<br>
[190] if (device =-= NULL)<br>
[191] return false;<br>
[192] If the cast succeeds, the object can be used as desired. The method can be<br>
adapted to return if the cast is not successful. If a given SmartClient is a<br>
programmable object type, then the IHomeBase can be one of the following:<br>
[193] for Smart Clients that are represented by a block, the IHomeBase will<br>
be that block; or<br>
 <br>
[194] for Smart Clients that are represented by other means, such as inline<br>
code, the IHomeBase will be the editor's target object.<br>
[195] For Smart Clients that represent hardware configuration objects, their<br>
IHomeBase can be one of the following:<br>
[196] for Smart Clients that are represented by a DeviceItem, IHomeBase<br>
will be that Deviceltem; or<br>
[197] for Smart Clients that are represented by other means, IHomeBase will<br>
be an appropriate Deviceltem (e.g. a rack).<br>
[198] Parameters using Stream data types can be declared using an input/output<br>
declaration type. Although some of the streams can be used as an output type,<br>
such can be declared as input/output types in order to permit memory<br>
allocations to be garbage collected.<br>
[199] In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can utilize standard<br>
Platform support for undo and redo. In certain exemplary embodiments, core<br>
objects can be utilized and Smart Clients might not utilize support beyond<br>
standard object frame types.<br>
[200] In certain exemplary embodiments, the Smart Client can be stateless. In<br>
certain exemplary embodiments, upon completion of a configuration activity,<br>
editors can update the Smart Client's internal object representation into the<br>
attributes of the objects. Certain exemplary embodiments can be adapted to<br>
provide support for "Common Services" comprised within the Platform.<br>
[201] In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can generate configurations<br>
that are represented by many different types of objects. Each object can be<br>
generated or modified in a single configuration session. Undo and redo<br>
operations can identify and manage certain objects within a single<br>
configuration session as a single undo and redo transaction.<br>
[202] In certain exemplary embodiments, the caller (editor or workbench) can<br>
enable an undo transaction before the Smart Client is actually called. Certain<br>
undoable operations performed by the Smart Client before control is returned<br>
to the caller can be recorded within such a single transaction. Once the Smart<br>
 <br>
Client relinquishes control to the caller, the transaction can be closed. In this<br>
manner, all undoable actions can be recorded within an individual transaction.<br>
[203] An undo operation might not automatically display the view that originally<br>
was used to change the configuration. For example, assuming the editor's'<br>
property area was used to perform the Smart Client configuration, if the<br>
property area is not visible, an undo operation might not cause the window to<br>
become visible. In this context, the customer might not be able to visually see<br>
what is actually being undone.<br>
[204] Smart Clients can be aware that certain mnemonics can be subject to<br>
internationalization. Certain exemplary embodiments can handle such<br>
mnemonics according to the platform's current mnemonic setting. In order for<br>
a Smart Client to be capable of doing this, the smart client can obtain and/or<br>
receive the platform's current mnemonic setting via Scripting. Standard cross-<br>
reference support can provide appropriate visibility for Smart Clients<br>
component and resource usage.<br>
[205] As previously stated, Smart Clients can comprise many different program<br>
components (e.g., OBs, FCs/FBs, IDBs, etc). Cross-reference component<br>
usage can make use of the "generated" marker in order to determine<br>
appropriate visibility to the customer. The call-structure might show top-level<br>
calls to blocks representing the Smart Client. Certain calls within the Smart<br>
Client might not be visible.<br>
[206] In certain exemplary embodiments, certain shareable system-built-in resource<br>
used by the Smart Client can be visible within cross-reference usage. This<br>
means that any resource that might result in shared access by the customer's<br>
program can be identified as being used by the Smart Client. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, the resource can be a high-speed counter. Certain<br>
exemplary embodiments can comprise six high-speed counters. Cross-<br>
reference can be adapted to identify a usage of these resources.<br>
[207] Certain program components can be compared between a source and<br>
destination. The source and destination can vary between offline projects<br>
 <br>
contained on a disk and the online project being executed within the PLC.<br>
However, the Food &amp; Drug Association (FDA) can provide one or more<br>
regulations regarding a comparison operation to determine mat the application<br>
executing within the PLC is exactly the same application as stored in an<br>
offline state.<br>
[208] Consistent with the FDA regulations, Smart Client components and<br>
configurations can also be compared. The methodology used to perform these<br>
compares can be different depending upon decisions made within the<br>
architecture regarding visibility of generated components.<br>
[209] Certain exemplary embodiments can augment editor menus through the Smart<br>
Client. Certain exemplary Smart Clients can implement standardized<br>
interfaces that implement one or more public methods. An exemplary editor<br>
that supports Smart Clients can be adapted to interact with these interfaces.<br>
For menus, the editor can obtain this interface and provide certain context<br>
menu members for a predetermined Smart Client when receiving focus.<br>
[210] In certain exemplary embodiments, the interface in question can be a late<br>
binding interface. An early binding mechanism might be restricted to a<br>
prearranged set of interface members (e.g., methods, attributes, and/or iterator,<br>
etc.). An implementer might leave any of them out, but might not be able to<br>
add a method that has not been foreseen in the interface. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can add things that had not been made before. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, the Smart Client can be a unique new endeavor that<br>
may have novel specification.<br>
[211] The interface in question can be implemented by certain exemplary Smart<br>
Client and can be used (called) by an editor that uses a Smart Client. The<br>
interface can comprise two methods:<br>
[212] one to query a Smart Clients externally available functions; and/or<br>
[213] another one to invoke one of these functions.<br>
[214] The following pseudocode can be adapted to implement the interface.<br>
[215] Public interface ISmartClientMenu<br>
 <br>
[216] {<br>
[217] // Called by an editor to get to know a Smart client's specific<br>
functionality.<br>
[218] // (for instance to set up a context menu displaying these items)<br>
[219] int GetAvailableVerbs ( [out] string f] AvailableVerbs);<br>
[220] // Called by an editor to invoke one of the Smart client specific<br>
functionality<br>
[221 ] int Do Verb ( [in] string VerbName, [in] DeviceItem Dev);<br>
[222] }<br>
[223] In certain exemplary embodiments, an editor can query such an interface and<br>
call an associated GetAvailableVerbs method when a Smart Client comes into<br>
focus. The Smart Client can be adapted to return a list of verbs informing<br>
about its externally available functionality. The editor can be adapted to call<br>
the following function (expressed as pseudocode):<br>
[224] string[] AvailableVerbsOfSmartClient = this.GetAvailableVerbs O;<br>
[225] In certain exemplary embodiments, menu items can be shown as a context<br>
menu of the Smart Client instance, not in main menu. Upon a user's selection,<br>
the editor might call a DoVerb method to perform the selected action. The<br>
following pseudocode is an exemplary embodiment of the DoVerb method:<br>
[226] String VerbToPerform = "Configure";<br>
[227] if !( this.DoVerb (VerbToPerform, Device) )<br>
[228] // everything is alright<br>
[229] else<br>
[230] // raise exception<br>
[231] Public interface ISmartDeviccConfig<br>
[232] {<br>
[233] }<br>
[234] Such pseudocode describes what services might be provided by the methods<br>
and properties made available by the system (Engineering Platform and<br>
Domain Objects). In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can be<br>
adapted to interact with the system. In certain exemplary embodiments. Smart<br>
 <br>
Clients can be enhanced by associated capabilities of an externa] model<br>
exposed by a scripting subsystem. In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
capabilities such as get and set can be reflected in the scripting language<br>
directly as properties. For example, a get or set network might be<br>
implemented within the scripting language as follows:<br>
[235] Block[My_OB].CodeSection.Network[Network_Number]<br>
[236] The capabilities described below are not intended to represent all possible<br>
services. In certain exemplary embodiments, other services might be<br>
provided. In certain exemplary embodiments. Smart Clients can comprise one<br>
or more of functional attributes indicated in the following tables:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
[237] Each instantiation of a Smart Client can result in an instance object created by<br>
the factory. As previously stated, the factory might provide an interface to<br>
access this instance object to the editor.<br>
[238] FIG. 17 is an exemplary set of user interfaces 17000, which can comprise an<br>
instruction tree user interface 17100, an editor icon 17300, and a data structure<br>
user interface 17400. In set of user interfaces 17000, the instance object can<br>
represents a particular Smart Client instance. The state information of a Smart<br>
Client can be made persistent. Certain exemplary embodiments can use<br>
existing editor objects and expand them in such a way that storage is provided.<br>
[239] For Smart Clients that are represented by a block, storage might be reserved in<br>
the block. For Smart Clients that are represented by other means, such as<br>
 <br>
inline code, the storage might be reserved in the editor's target object. In<br>
certain exemplary embodiments, the editor can be adapted to distinguish<br>
between storage for multiple Smart Client instances (multiple expando<br>
attributes, each with a unique reference to the particular Smart Client<br>
instance).<br>
[240] In certain exemplary embodiments, a Smart Client can be visually represented<br>
by a call. The actual code can be generated as either an actual call or inline,<br>
once the general language pragma "inline" is available.<br>
[241] For Smart Clients that are represented by a block, the provided "IHomeBase"<br>
can be this block. For Smart Clients that are represented by other means, the<br>
provided "IHomeBase" might be the editor's target block. The "Smart Client"<br>
can be adapted to use "IHomeBase" to navigate through the object model to<br>
acquire appropriate objects. In certain exemplary embodiments, "IHomeBase"<br>
can be used to find the block container to create new blocks.<br>
[242] In certain exemplary embodiments, once the editor's target block is used, a<br>
correlation can occur between each Smart Client instance stored within the<br>
block.<br>
[243] A Smart Client's instance object can comprise specific configuration data that<br>
is not stored in other locations (e.g., instance DBs). For example, a<br>
"configuration complete" flag can be utilized, which can indicate whether the<br>
Smart Client has been successfully configured. A successful configuration<br>
can be detected and/or determined during program compilation. Typed OBs<br>
can permit multiple instances of the same OB type, such as cyclic, timed<br>
interrupt, and/or first scan, etc.<br>
[244] Smart Clients can use their own specific instances of typed OBs. The typed<br>
OBs can be independent and distinct from the typed OBs specifically inserted<br>
into a project by a customer. The Smart Client OBs can be marked as<br>
"generated" and can therefore be filtered from being visible to the customer.<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments can support typed OBs.<br>
 <br>
[245] An editor can be adapted to flag the particular expando attribute holding the<br>
Smart Client internal object as a "component to be downloaded", which can<br>
result in these parts of the objects (blocks) being downloaded and uploaded<br>
just as the code section. After an upload, internal objects can appear just as<br>
before download and thus can be available for further operation.<br>
[246] Other information specified by the configuration sequence can be stored as<br>
parts of other objects (for instance actual values in DBs). These parts can be<br>
downloaded and/or uploaded along with objects and hence are also available.<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments can be adapted to support not only upload,<br>
but also import and export of Smart Client data.<br>
[247] In certain exemplary embodiments, project components specifically created by<br>
Smart Clients can be hidden from the customer's view. Certain exemplary<br>
customers might wish to regard Smart Clients as black boxes. Such customers<br>
might not understand additional components being made visible within a<br>
project. As a result, the customer might not desire to manage these<br>
components. In certain exemplary embodiments, generated components can<br>
remain in the customer's project.<br>
[248] Making components invisible can have architectural implications. Operations<br>
such as compare, delete, and copy might involve the Smart Client. The Smart<br>
Client, for example, might know what components should be deleted and<br>
when they should be deleted. Also, the Smart client might know what<br>
components might be compared to determine equality.<br>
[249] Additionally, these operations can be performed by the Smart Client<br>
regardless of where the operation was initiated. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, the Smart Client might be adapted to perform such operations<br>
whether the operation was initiated by an action within the language editor or<br>
from the Project Navigator. The Smart Client can be informed of such a<br>
request so the operation can be performed.<br>
[250] If certain architectural changes cannot be provided, another solution can be<br>
provided, which might comprise making the project components visible within<br>
 <br>
the project navigator via a special filter, which might be based upon a special<br>
"generated" flag. Each component generated by the Smart Client might<br>
include the "generated" flag as a property.<br>
[251] The Project Navigator might use this "generated" flag to organize or filter<br>
these components in a different way. For example, an additional system<br>
generated folder(s) might be added to a tree and certain "generated"<br>
components be contained within folder(s). Certain exemplary embodiments<br>
can help minimize the impact to the customer, whilst fulfilling FDA<br>
requirements.<br>
[252] Making elements visible can permit the customer to perform basic project<br>
operations such as comparing or viewing properties (such as, according to<br>
FDA regulations). Manual deletion of such components might be permitted so<br>
customers can manage potential cluttering.<br>
[253] A language editor that supports Smart Clients can be extended to support<br>
additional capabilities. The language editor can be adapted to recognize when<br>
Smart Clients are dealt with rather than regular instructions. When an editor<br>
receives a command for a Smart Client, the editor can surrender execution to<br>
the Smart Client. Commands supported by a Smart Client can be defined by<br>
interface specifications.<br>
[254] In certain exemplary embodiments, language editors can support language-<br>
related Smart Clients through the use of blocks. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, macro (inline code) capabilities can be supported. For example,<br>
a user's view can appear as a block, but can be implemented as a macro.<br>
[255] Several capabilities might be realized when utilizing block functionality,<br>
which can comprise:<br>
[256] operand tooltips;<br>
[257] operand online status;<br>
[258] power flow connectors (EN/ENO);<br>
[259] default and dynamic prototypes as described below; and/or<br>
[260] textual language integration; etc.<br>
 <br>
[261] Certain exemplary language-related Smart Clients can have a default<br>
prototype (the number of inputs and outputs along with their data types),<br>
which can be used upon instantiation. Such Smart Clients can be adapted to<br>
change the default prototype depending upon a configuration selected by the<br>
customer. The number of inputs or outputs or the associated data types might<br>
change from the defaults, which might involve programmatically changing<br>
prototypes of existing instructions. In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
updating cab maintain an existing operand configuration of an existing call.<br>
[262] The following functionality for Smart Client Customization can be<br>
implemented as general functionality:<br>
[263] specific icons for calls rather than the standard call icon can be used in<br>
ladder instances;<br>
[264] a flag for defining that the component can be "generated" by a Smart<br>
Client;<br>
[263] a flag that can associate a Smart Client assembly with a normal block<br>
call, which can allows the platform to start a Smart Client rather than a<br>
typical editor when the user performs an action on a block (visual<br>
instance offline and online); and/or<br>
[266] generate inline code rather than submit a call through the use of the<br>
inline "pragma" directive; etc.<br>
[267] In certain exemplary embodiments, discussions within each of interfaces and<br>
methods of these interfaces can comprise implications regarding interactions<br>
with scripting interfaces.<br>
[268] In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can be associated with<br>
program editors. As a result, the following example will focus upon a<br>
particular type of Smart Client using a P1D instruction as an example.<br>
[269] The developer(s) of Smart Clients can define the various inheritance and<br>
aggregation models associated with these instructions. Although the various<br>
inheritance and aggregation models might not be part of the SPH-<br>
considerations, an example is provided below for further clarification.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
[270] The "ISmartClient" interface can define a set of behaviors that can be<br>
implemented by a Smart Client object. In addition to the "ISmartClient"<br>
interface, a "SmartClientBase" class can be made available. This base class<br>
can derive from the "ISmartClient" interface and provide basic behaviors for<br>
the required interface. Providing both an interface and base class can allow a<br>
client to inherit from either definition depending upon which provides the<br>
most value for a particular client.<br>
[271] Some particular types of Smart Clients might optionally provide their own<br>
base behaviors. For example, different types of P1D instructions can be<br>
adapted to provide standard PID behaviors within a common base. Such a<br>
PID base can comprise a container for PID instructions, which might provide a<br>
way for other PID related objects, such as the PID Tuning Control Panel, to<br>
list or iterate through the different PID instances.<br>
[272] FIG. 18 is a block diagram of an exemplary system 18000, which can<br>
comprise an Ismartclient object 18100, a Smartclientbase object 18200, a<br>
SCCollection object 18300, a PIDBase object 18400, a PIDCollection object<br>
18500, a PIDContinuous object 18600, a PIDStepControIler object 18700, and<br>
a NextSmartClient object 18800<br>
[273] Certain exemplary embodiments provide an interface "ISmartClient" that can<br>
be inherited by certain Smart Clients. Each Smart Client can be adapted to<br>
provide a specific implementation for its own behavior as mentioned above.<br>
Implementing pseudocode can be as follows:<br>
[274] public class ContinuousPID : PIDBase or<br>
[275] public class ContinuousPID : SmartClientBase or<br>
[276] public class ContinuousPID : ISmartClient<br>
[277] {<br>
[278] // implementation of a Smart Client can go here<br>
 <br>
[279]	int CrcateInstance (IScriptObject IHomeBase, ...){...}<br>
[280]	int EditInstance (IScriptObject IHomeBase) {...}<br>
[281 ]	int Tooltip (IScriptObject IHomeBase) {...}<br>
[282]	...<br>
[283] }<br>
[284] In certain exemplary embodiments, some types of Smart Clients might have<br>
additional base classes that provide standard behaviors for the given type. In<br>
certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients might conform to standard<br>
specifications associated with a Platform usability model. Such specifications<br>
can be defined within the Platform usability model.<br>
[285] In certain exemplary embodiments, standard platform controls can be used for<br>
user interfaces. In certain exemplary embodiments, standard platform controls<br>
might not be exposed through a scripting interface. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, standard platform controls can be accessed via a duplicate of<br>
common services assemblies dedicated to external use. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, standard platform controls of the Platform's common service<br>
interface can be exposed to certain participating Smart Clients.<br>
[286] Any Smart Client can conform to standard Platform internationalization<br>
specifications. Any textual user interface item can be displayed within<br>
property pages, error messages, tool tips, help, icons, etc, must conform to<br>
these standard requirements. A Smart Client can interrogate current<br>
internationalization settings via Scripting to fulfill this requirement.<br>
[287] In certain exemplary embodiments, access to the Project Navigator might not<br>
be provided from Smart Clients. In certain exemplary embodiments, actions<br>
performed by Smart Clients can be accomplished via interfaces provided by<br>
the scripting subsystem. For such embodiments, potential compatibility issues<br>
and concerns might be comprehended by the scripting interfaces.<br>
[288] In certain exemplary embodiments. Smart Clients might not be affected by<br>
future revisions of the Platform. New versions of the platform might not<br>
invoke software changes to existing Smart Clients.<br>
 <br>
[289] In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can use common service<br>
interfaces. The scripting subsystem can be adapted to determine if such<br>
service interfaces are exposed via the scripting interface or are accessed<br>
directly.<br>
[290] In certain exemplary embodiments, common platform actions performed by<br>
Smart Clients can be accomplished through a duplicate of the common service<br>
interface dedicated to external use. To ensure mat Smart Clients have a<br>
consistent appearance and behavior, certain exemplary embodiments can use<br>
external platform common services. Common services can comprise customer<br>
feedback services such as error message displays, error message reporting,<br>
and/or message boxes, etc.<br>
[291] In certain exemplary embodiments, each individual Smart Client can establish<br>
levels of compatibility for succeeding Smart Client versions. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can provide a similar level of<br>
compatibility as the Platform. For example, a particular version of a Smart<br>
Client might be able to understand previous versions.<br>
[292] In certain exemplary embodiments, individual project components (e.g., OBs,<br>
DBs, FBs, and/or FCs, etc.) might become visible to the customer. Such<br>
decisions might be made individually during the development of each Smart<br>
Client. In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients can be deployed<br>
within additional packages such as "Hardware Support Packages" or<br>
"Optional Packages". Each additional package can be individually installed<br>
upon a given programmable logic controller (PLC). In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, a particular Smart Client might be saved to a project with the<br>
project being provided to a different PLC that docs not have the same<br>
additional packages installed.<br>
[293] In certain exemplary embodiments, customers can acquire and install<br>
additional packages to be able to operate Smart Clients. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments. Smart Clients can be downloaded to the PLC and/or executed.<br>
In certain exemplary embodiments, further edits to Smart Client<br>
 <br>
configurations might not be supported until the additional packages are<br>
installed.<br>
[294] In certain exemplary embodiments, Smart Clients might not have<br>
compatibility specifications with existing legacy applications. In situations<br>
where existing legacy projects are opened, conversions might not be<br>
performed from a legacy application to the new Smart Client representations.<br>
For example, if the application originally developed in the classic world<br>
includes application code for a high-speed counter, the high-speed counter<br>
might not be converted into a corresponding Smart Client representing the<br>
high-speed counter.<br>
[295] FIG. 19 is a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method 19000. Each<br>
activity of method 19000 can be implemented manually and/or automatically.<br>
Each activity of method 19000 can be encoded and/or embodied in machine<br>
executable instructions stored on a machine-readable medium. The machine<br>
instructions can be adapted to perform any activity or subset of activities of<br>
method 19000. At activity 19100, a hierarchical tree can be defined. The<br>
hierarchical tree can be a logical tree that comprises branches and/or leaves.<br>
Each branch and/or leaf of the hierarchical tree can represent an available<br>
subset of machine instructions that can be adapted to configure a PLC system<br>
component and/or automatically generate other machine instructions, such as a<br>
PLC control program.<br>
[296] At activity 19200, an editor can be defined. The editor can be adapted to<br>
configure one or more applications associated with the PLC control program.<br>
The editor can be adapted to receive instructions in a programming language<br>
specified in IEC 61131L3.<br>
[297] At activity 19300, a user interface Tenderer can be provided, which can be<br>
adapted to automatically cause a plurality of distinct user interfaces to be<br>
rendered. Each user interface from the plurality of distinct user interfaces can<br>
be adapted to configure a corresponding software application from a plurality<br>
of software applications associated with operating a programmable logic<br>
 <br>
controller (PLC). For a selected software application from the plurality of<br>
software applications, the user interface renderer can be adapted to<br>
automatically provide a first user interface if the PLC is executing a control<br>
program and a second user interface if the PLC is not executing the control<br>
program.<br>
[298] At activity 19400, a user interface can be rendered. For example, the first user<br>
interface can be adapted to facilitate debugging the selected software<br>
application. The first user interface can be adapted to receive a debugging<br>
input from a user. The second user interface can be adapted to provide a<br>
current set of configuration parameters associated with the selected software<br>
application. The second user interface adapted to receive a configuration input<br>
from the user, and responsive to the configuration input, the second user<br>
interface can be adapted to change one or more configuration parameters from<br>
the current set of configuration parameters.<br>
[299] At activity 19500, a device and/or application can be configured. The device<br>
and/or application can be automatically configured based upon the<br>
configuration input. In certain exemplary embodiments, responsive to the<br>
configuration input by the user, the application can be automatically generated<br>
and can be used as a portion of a control program of the PLC.<br>
[300] At activity 19600, the user interface can be regenerated. The regenerated user<br>
interface can have context information and/or values comprised therein from<br>
the configuration input and can thereby be distinct and/or different that<br>
previously generated versions of the user interface.<br>
[301] FIG. 20 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of an information<br>
device 20000, which in certain operative embodiments can comprise, for<br>
example, information device 1540 of FIG. 1. Information device 20000 can<br>
comprise any of numerous components, such as for example, one or more<br>
network interfaces 20100, one or more processors 20200, one or more<br>
memories 20300 containing instructions 20400, one or more input/output (I/O)<br>
 <br>
devices 20500, and/or one or more user interfaces 20600 coupled to I/O device<br>
20500, etc.<br>
[302] In certain exemplary embodiments, via one or more user interfaces 20600,<br>
such as a graphical user interface, a user can view a rendering of information<br>
related to researching, designing, modeling, creating, developing, building,<br>
manufacturing, operating, maintaining, storing, marketing, selling, delivering,<br>
selecting, specifying, requesting, ordering, receiving, returning, rating, and/or<br>
recommending any of the products, services, methods, and/or information<br>
described herein.<br>

[367] hard deadline - the special case where completing an activity within<br>
the deadline results in the system receiving all the utility possible from<br>
mat activity, and completing the activity outside of the deadline results<br>
in zero utility (i.e., resources consumed by the activity were wasted,<br>
such as when one travels to the beach to photograph a sunrise on a<br>
particular day and arrives after the sun has already arisen) or some<br>
negative value of utility (i.e., the activity was counter-productive, such<br>
as when firefighters enter a burning building to search for a missing<br>
person seconds before the building collapses, resulting in injury or<br>

[368] hard real-time - relating to computer systems that provide an absolute<br>
deterministic response to an event. Such a response is not based on<br>

well-defined time. Systems operating in hard real-time typically<br>
interact at a low level with physical hardware via embedded systems,<br>
and can suffer a critical failure if time constraints are violated. A<br>
classic example of a hard real-time computing system is the anti-lock<br>
 <br>
brakes on a car. The hard real-time constraint, or deadline, in this<br>
system is the time in which the brakes must be released to prevent the<br>
wheel from locking. Another example is a car engine control system,<br>
in which a delayed control signal might cause engine failure or<br>
damage. Other examples of hard real-time embedded systems include<br>
medical systems such as heart pacemakers and industrial process<br>
controllers.<br>

 <br>
reaction based on a current error, an integral calculation determines a<br>
reaction based on a sum of recent errors, and a derivative calculation<br>
determines a reaction based on a rate at which the error has. been<br>

time, continuously generated, continuously varying, analog, discretely<br>
 <br>
generated, discretely varying, quantized, digital, continuously<br>
measured, and/or discretely measured, etc.<br>
[434] soft deadline - the general case where completing the activity by the<br>
deadline results in the system receiving a utility measured in terms of<br>
lateness (completion time minus deadline), such that there exist<br>
positive lateness values corresponding to positive utility values for the<br>
system. Lateness can be viewed in terms of tardiness (positive<br>
lateness), or earliness (negative lateness). Generally, and potentially<br>
within certain bounds, larger positive values of lateness or tardiness<br>
represent lower utility, and larger positive values of earliness represent<br>
greater utility.<br>
[435] soft real-time - relating to computer systems that take a best efforts<br>
approach and minimize latency from event to response as much as<br>
possible while keeping throughput up with external events overall.<br>
Such systems will not suffer a critical failure if time constraints are<br>
violated. For example, live audio-video systems are usually soft real-<br>
time; violation of time constraints can result in degraded quality, but<br>
the system can continue to operate. Another example is a network<br>
server, which is a system for which fast response is desired but for<br>
which there is no deadline. If the network server is highly loaded, its<br>
response time may slow with no failure in service. This is contrasted<br>
with the anti-lock braking system where a slow down in response<br>
would likely cause system failure, possibly even catastrophic failure.<br>
