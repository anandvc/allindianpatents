The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an Indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative with other antitumor agent wInch exInbits an excellent effect, particularly a synergistic effect of<br>
inInbiting the growth of cancer cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to a combined preparation of an indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative and other antitumor agent(s), a treating method comprising the administration of an indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative and other antitumor agent(s), and use of an indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative and other antitumor agent(s) for manufacturing a preparation for cancer treatment.<br>
Background Art<br>
The development of various pharmaceuticals, particularly, therapeutic agents for infectious diseases, therapeutic agents for hypertension, therapeutic agents for hyperlipemia, and the like has prolonged the human life span. The prolonged life span, however, has increased the death rate from diseases wInch are considered to be Inghly associated with aging, and tIns has become serious issues in developed countries as well as in developing countries, In particular, the death rate from a malignant neoplasm, what is called a cancer, has dramatically increased in Japan, Europe and the United States. There are various methods for cancer treatment, for example, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immune therapy, and the combination of several treating methods has improved the survival ratio. In the treatment of metastasis to other tissues, wInch is one problem of cancer, however, the treatment by surgery or radiation therapy is limited. Thus, chemotherapy, i.e., medicinal treatment is mainly attempted.<br>
Many agents for chemotherapy have been reported. These antitumor agents are roughly classified into: antitumor alkylating agents that are typified by cyclophosphamide; antitumor antimetabolites that are typified by 5-fiuorouracil; antitumor antibiotics that are typified by<br><br>
doxorubicin hydrochloride; plant-derived antitumor agents that are typified by vincristine and paclitaxel; antitumor platinum-complex compounds that are typified by cisplatin; and the like. The present inventors have found a novel indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative having potent antitumor activities, and had applied for patent on the series of compounds (for example, United States Patent Nos. 5591842, 5668271, 5804564, and 5922860, WO 95/30682, WO 96/04293, WO 98/0743, EP-A-0528030, and JP-A-10-245390).<br>
Heretofore, a combined use of staurosporine, i.e., an indolocarbazole derivative, or a derivative thereof with other antitumor agent(s) has been described in literature (for example, JP-A-02-108636, WO 94/20106, WO 2001/04125, JP-A-08-50012, and JP-A-10-500394). However, staurosporine and its derivatives are significantly different from the compound of general formula I according to the invention of the present application in their structures. Also, wInle staurosporine and its derivatives exInbit the inInbitory action on protein kinase C, the compound of general formula I according to the present invention exInbits the inInbitory action on topoisomerase I (T. YosInnari et al., Cancer Research, 55, 1310-1315 (1995)). Further, the prior art documents do not disclose or suggest the combined use of the compound of general formula I according to the present invention with other antitumor agent(s).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention is aimed to expand the application range of chemotherapeutics by combining an antitumor indolocarbazole derivative with other antitumor agent(s) and to provide a better antitumor effect, in particular, a synergistic effect compared to the use of one agent.<br>
More specifically, an object of the present invention is to provide a combined preparation or mixture for synergistically enhancing the antitumor effects, wInch comprises an indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative in combination with other antitumor agent(s). Another object of the present invention is to treat cancer patients by administering the indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative in combination with other antitumor agent(s). A further object of the present invention is to use the indolopyrrolocarbazole derivative and other antitumor agent(s) to produce a preparation for cancer treatment.<br>
The present inventors had conducted concentrated studies on combinations of the already<br><br>
disclosed indalapycrolacarbazole antitumor compound witti other antitumor ageut(s). As a insult, they foiind a combination exInbiting an excellent antitumor effect, in particular, a synergistic effect.<br>

Example 1<br>
Effect of a combined use of drugs using cells<br>
a)	Reagent<br>
Fetal calf serum (FCS) was obtained from Moregate, and DMEM medium was obtained from AsaIn Techno Glass Corporation. Compound A (the compound of formula IA) was synthesized in accordance with the method by Ohkubo et al. (M. Ohkubo et al., Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett., 9, 3307-3312 (1999)). Cisplatin (CDDP, randa injection) was obtained from Nippon Kayaku; campthotecin (CPT) was obtained from Sigma; adriamycin (ADM, Adriacin) was obtained from KYOWA HAKKO KOGYO Co., Ltd.; vincristine (VCR, Oncovin) was obtained from SInonogi &amp; Co. Ltd.; and carboplatin (CBDCA) was obtained from Sigma.<br>
b)	Cells<br>
HCT116 human large intestine cancer cells, SCC-25 human tongue cancer cells, A427 human non-small cell lung cancer cells, and J82 human bladder cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).<br>
c)	Evaluation method of effect<br>
Cells were suspended in 10% FCS-added DMEM medium, and a cell suspension in an amount of 1,000 cells/50 ul/well was inoculated on a 96-well plastic plate. Culture was conducted at 37°C in 5% C02-95% air overnight. Each drug was diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide or a suitable solvent, and 50 ul each of one drug or two drugs were added on the plate having cells inoculated thereon. Culture is further conducted for 3 days at 37CC in 5% CCV95% air. Cell growth was mesured by the WST-8 method (H. Tominaga et al., Anal. Commun., 36, 47-50 (1999)). The WST-8 method used herein refers to a method comprising the steps of adding 10 pi of WST-8<br><br>
reagent solution to each well, continuing the culture for 1 to 6 hours at 37°C, stirring the plate, measuring the amount of formazan produced by colorimetry, and determining the inInbitory rate of the drug.<br>
The drug interaction of two drugs was evaluated by the isobologram method (G. G. Steel and M. Peckham, Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys., 5, 85-91 (1979)).   In accordance with the isobologram method, the 50% growth inInbitory concentration QCX) of each drug was determined, and graphs were prepared using cell survival ratios and relative concentrations (the concentration of the drug when IC50 is 1.0).   Subsequently, the graph obtained from each drug was used; and the case where the drugs, wInch were used together, were a combination of drugs having action mechanisms different from each other (mode 1) and the case where the drugs had similar action mechanisms (mode 2) were hypothesized; and two lines were plotted (see Fig. 1).   When the point representing the cell growth inInbitory ratio in the case of actual combined use was present in the region sandwiched between these two lines, the drug interaction was evaluated as an additive effect. When the point was below the region surrounded by the two lines, it was evaluated as an synergistic effect.   When the point was above the region, it was evaluated as an antagonistic effect. Fig. \ shows a synergistic effect exInbited by the combined use of compound A and cisplatin.   Fig. 2 shows a synergistic effect exInbited by the combined use of compound A and carboplatin.   The evaluation of effects is described in the following.<br><br><br>
Example 2 Effect ofa combined use of dmes using animals (1)<br>
a)	Mouse and cancer cells<br>
Female CDF1 mice (4- or 5-week old) were obtained from Charles River Japan, Inc. P388 mouse leukemia cells were obtained from the National Cancer Center Institute.<br>
b)	Reagent<br>
Compound A, cisplatin, etoposide, and adriamycin (doxorubicin) are the same as in Example 1.<br>
c)	Evaluation method of effect<br>
P388 mouse leukemia cells (1 x 106 cells) were transplanted intraperitoneally per mouse (day 0). One drug or two drugs were intraperitoneally administered on the next day (day 1). The control group wInch was not treated with dmgs and the group wInch was treated with drugs were observed for the number of days they survived. The mice who had survived by the end of the experiment (day 30) and did not retain peritoneal fluids were determined as complete remission, and calculation was made by determining the number of days they survived as 60 days. The ratio of increased life span QLS%) was determined according to the following equation:<br>
ILS% = ((the number of survived days for the group treated with drug) / (the number of survived days for the control group without drug) -1) x 100<br>
The combination index (CI) showing combination effect was determined by the following equation in accordance with the method by UcInda et al. (UcInda et al., Gan to Kagaku Ryouhou (Cancer and Chemotherapy), 25, 75-78 (1998)) based on the BLS% obtained from the treatment using one dmg and the ILS% obtained from the combined treatment.<br>
CI = JLSfc of the combined treatment / (ILS% with J-107088 (Compound A) alone + ILS% with another drug)<br>
The effect exInbited by the combined use of two drugs was evaluated as follows based on CI.<br>
CI &gt; 1: synergistic effect, CI = 1: additive effect, CI 
 <br><br>
As is apparent from Table 2, compound A exInbits synergistic antitumor effects by the combined use with cisplatin, adriamycin, or etoposide.<br>
Example 3<br>
Effect of combined use of drugs using animals (2)<br>
a) Mouse and cancer cells<br>
Female nude mice (5-week old) were obtained from Charles River Japan, Inc. Human large intestine cancer HCT116 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.<br>
b)	Reagent<br>
Compound A was synthesized in accordance with the method by Ohkubo et al. as in Example 1. 5-FluorouracU (5-FU) was obtained from KYOWA HAKKO KOGYO Co., Ltd., and leucovorin (trade name, Isovorin injection) was obtained from Takeda Chemical Ind.<br>
c)	Evaluation method of effect<br>
The HCT116 cells, wInch are continuously maintained subcutaneously in nude mice, were sliced in 3-mm square, and a piece was subcutaneously transplanted to each of nude mice that were to be subjected to the experiment. When the subcutaneous tumor volume reached 0.07 cm3 to 0.36 cm3, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups as shown in Table 3 (day 0).<br><br><br>
Compound A (0.3 mg/kg) was administered into the tail vein on days 0 and 7. Leucovorin (83.3 mg/kg) was administered into the caudate vein on days 2,4, 9, and 11. One hour after the leucovorin administration, 10 mg/kg of 5-FU was administered into the tail vein.<br>
The tumor volume was determined by the following equation based on the longer axis and the shorter axis of the tumor:<br>
Tumor volume (cm3) = (longer axis (cm)x (shorter axis (cm))2/2).<br>
The tumor volume was measured with time to compare with the tumor volume when the administration was initiated. TIns value was subject to the test evaluating significant differences (Mann-WInteney's U-test) among the group to wInch only compound A was administered, the group to wInch 5-FU + leucovorin were administered, and the group to wInch compound A + 5-FU + leucovorin were administered. The group to wInch compound A + 5-FU + leucovorin were administered was determined to be significantly different (P 
 <br><br>
Example 4<br>
Effect of lowering toxicity by the combined use of drugs<br>
a)	Mouse and cancer cells<br>
Female CDF1 mice (4- or 5-week old) and P388 mouse leukemia cells are the same as in Example 2.<br>
b)	Reagent<br>
Compound A and adnamycin (doxorubicin) are the same as in Example 1.<br>
c)	Evaluation method of effect<br>
P388 mouse leukemia cells (1 x 106 cells) were transplanted intraperitoneally per mouse (day 0). One drug or two drugs were intraperitoneally administered on the next day (day 1). The control group wInch was not treated with drugs, and the group wInch was treated with drugs were observed for the number of days they survived. The mice who had survived by the end of the experiment (day 30) and did not retain peritoneal fluids were determined as complete recovery, and calculation was made by regarding the number of days they survived as 60 days. The ratio of increased life span (ILS%) was determined in the same manner as in Example 2.<br>
The dose wInch exInbits the equivalent ILS% in the use of compound A alone, in the use of ADM alone, or in the combined use of compound A and ADM, was determined. TIns dose was intraperitoneally administered to mice once a day for consecutive 5 days. Thereafter, whether the animal was alive or dead was observed, and the effect of lowering toxicity was judged. As the toxicity index, the changes in the body weight between that before the administration and that on the subsequent day after the administration were recorded.<br><br><br><br>
As is apparent from Tables 5 and 6, the combined use of compound A with adriamycin can significantly decrease the amount of each drug, and it exInbited the effect of reducing side effects.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The compound of general formula I (particularly compound A) and other antitumor agents (e.g., cisplatin, adriamycin (doxorubicin), carboplatin, and 5-FU/leucovorin) exInbited synergistic antitumor activities in vitro or in vivo. The combined administration of these drugs significantly decreased the amount of each drug (e.g., the combined use of compound A and adriamycin (doxorubicin)). Accordingly, it can be expected that the use of the compound of general formula I (particularly compound A) with other drugs can be applied for wider applications. Specifically, when the compound of general formula I (particularly compound A) exInbits synergistic effects with other drugs, the dose of the compound of general formula I (particularly compound A) can be smaller than the case when it is administered alone. TIns also led to alleviation of side-effects , wInch is a side benefit.<br><br><br>
