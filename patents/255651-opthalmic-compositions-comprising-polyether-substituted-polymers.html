Ophthalmic Compositions comprising Polyether Substituted Polymers<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to ophthalmic compositions comprising<br>
polyether substituted polymers. More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
ophthalmic formulations, solutions and devices comprising polyether substituted<br>
polymers.<br>
Dry eye syndrome is an ocular surface disorder, which leads to severe<br>
irritation, redness, and itchiness of the eye. The problem may arise from disruptions<br>
in any one of the three major components of the tear film, namely the lipid, aqueous,<br>
and mucous layers, or from abnormalities in the expression of their constituent<br>
molecules.<br>
Currently the majority of dry eye treatments involve the use of inorganic<br>
salts, viscous solutions of hydrophilic polymers, and combinations of the two as<br>
topical applications. It has been reported that an exponential loss of tear fluid occurs<br>
via the puncta upon instillation of artificial tear substitutes. Accordingly, is not<br>
limited to soft contact lenses, hard contact lenses, intraocular lenses, overlay lenses,<br>
ocular inserts, and optical inserts.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise, consist essentially and<br>
consist of at least one lens forming component and at least one water soluble<br>
polymer. As used herein the term water soluble, means both soluble in water at or<br>
above room temperature as well as dispersible in water at or above room<br>
temperature. Water soluble polymers of the present invention comprise linear or<br>
branched polyether pendant groups having a molecular weight of at least about 300.<br>
The water soluble polymers have a weight average molecular weight of at least<br>
about 300,000 Daltons, preferably.greater than about 500,000; more preferably<br>
greater than about 800,000 Daltons. The weight average molecular weight may be<br><br>
measured via gel permeation chromatography against appropriate standards, such as<br>
polymethyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable polyether pendant groups may be derived from monomers of the<br>
Formula I<br><br>
wherein n is greater than or equal to 7; m is 1 or 2; Z is a C1-C6 substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl group, q is 0,1 or 2 and p is 2-q, y is 2 to 4, A is any free radical<br>
polymerizable group and X is a substituent independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of H, hydroxyl, unsubstituted straight or branched alkyl groups,<br>
substituted straight or branched alkyl groups, substituted and un substituted amines,<br>
substituted and unsubstituted amides, mercaptans, ethers and esters.<br>
Examples of free radical polymerizable groups include acrylates, styryls,<br>
vinyls, vinyl ethers, C1-6alkylacrylates, acrylamides, C1-6alkylacrylamides, N-<br>
vinyllactams, N-vinylamides, C2-12alkenyls, C2-12alkenylphenyls,<br>
C2-12alkenylnaphthyls, or C2-6alkenylphenylC1-6alkyls. Preferred free radical<br>
polymerizable groups include methacrylates, acryloxys, methacrylamides,<br>
acrylamides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably X is selected from substituted or unsubstituted straight<br>
or branched C1-16 alkyl groups, and more preferably from substituted or<br>
unsubstituted straight or branched C1-12 alkyl groups.<br>
Substituents on the substituted alky groups for X include carboxylic acids,<br>
esters, acyl halides, amines, amides, ketones, aldehydes, halides, sulfides,<br>
mercaptans, quartenary ammonium salts combinations thereof and the like.<br>
Substituents on the substituted alky groups for Z include hydroxyl,<br>
carboxylic acids, esters, acyl halides, amines, amides, ketones, aldehydes, halides,<br>
sulfides, mercaptans, quartenary ammonium salts combinations thereof and the like<br><br>
Preferably n is 7 to 50 and more preferably 7 to 40.<br>
Examples of monomers of Formula I include polymerizable ethoxylated<br>
methanols having seven or more ether linkages, such as but not limited to mPEG<br>
350, mPEG 475, mPEG1100, greater homologues thereof, combinations thereof and<br>
the like. Preferred monomers of Formula I include mPEG 350, mPEG 475, mPEG<br>
1100 combinations thereof and the like. Suitable monomers may be purchased from<br>
various sources such as Aldrich, under the name polyethylene glycol methylether<br>
methacrylate, with an average molecular weight within the ranges stated herein.<br>
The water soluble polymer may further comprise pendant groups derived<br>
from comonomers. Suitable comonomers may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic and<br>
include polymerizable silicones, sugars, carbohydrates, polyethers, amides, lactams,<br>
sulfonic acids, sulfonates, amines, hydroxyls, ethers, esters, aldehydes, ketones,<br>
amino acids, methacrylated long chain hydrocarbons, polymerizable ionic<br>
compounds, reactive latent compounds which may be converted to ionic groups after<br>
the water soluble polymer is polymerized, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
Preferably suitable comonomers include polymerizable amides, lactams,<br>
polymerizable ionic compounds and glycosylated materials. Specific examples of<br>
copolymers include lauryl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate,<br>
methyl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methacrylic<br>
acid, glycerol monomethacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, 2-(-4-<br>
morpholinyl)ethyl methacrylate, morpholinyl methacrylamide, 2-(N,N-<br>
dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, dimethylacrylamide, N-vinyl polymerizable<br>
materials including N-vinyl-N-methylacetamide and N-vinyl pyrrolidone, styrene<br>
sulfonate, sodium 2- acrylamido-2-methyl-l-propanesulfonate,<br>
sulfopropylacrylamide, combinations thereof and the like. Preferred comonomers<br>
include dimethylacrylamide, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
It is believed that the water soluble polymers of the present invention act as<br>
artificial mucins, which help to retain the eyes natural tear film and lipid layer<br><br>
integrity. The many polyether pendant groups provide a hydrophilic, brush or<br>
comb-like structure to the water soluble polymers. Thus, in one embodiment, at<br>
least about 20%, and preferably at least about 30 of backbone units of the water<br>
soluble polymer have a pendant group bound thereto. In yet another embodiment at<br>
least about 20%, preferably at least about 60% and more preferably at least about<br>
75% of the pendant groups are polyether pendant groups of Formula I.<br>
The water soluble polymers may be made by a variety of methods including<br>
photopolymerization. The selected monomers of Formula I and comonomers are<br>
mixed with a photoinitiator, with or without a solvent and polymerized using<br>
radiation of the appropriate wavelength.<br>
Suitable photoinitiator systems include aromatic alpha-hydroxy ketones,<br>
alkoxyoxybenzoins, acetophenones, acylphosphine oxides, bisacylphosphine oxides,<br>
and a tertiary amine plus a diketone, mixtures thereof and the like. Illustrative<br>
examples of photoinitiators are 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, 2-hydroxy-2-<br>
methyl-1 -phenyl-propan-1 -one, bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl<br>
phosphine oxide (DMBAPO), bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphineoxide<br>
(Irgacure 819), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyldiphenyl phosphine oxide and 2,4,6-<br>
trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide, benzoin methyl ether and a combination<br>
of camphorquinone and ethyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzoate. Commercially<br>
available visible light initiator systems include Irgacure 819, Irgacure 1700, Irgacure<br>
1800, Irgacure 819, Irgacure 1850 (all from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and Lucirin<br>
TPO initiator (available from BASF). Commercially available UV photoinitiators<br>
include Darocur 1173 and Darocur 2959 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals). These and<br>
other photoinitators which may be used are disclosed in Volume HI, Photoinitiators<br>
for Free Radical Cationic &amp; Anionic Photopolymerization, 2nd Edition by J.V.<br>
Crivello &amp; K. Dietliker; edited by G. Bradley; John Wiley and Sons; New York;<br>
1998, which is incorporated herein by reference. The initiator is used in the reaction<br>
mixture in effective amounts to initiate photopolymerization of the reaction mixture,<br><br>
e.g., from about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts of reactive monomer.<br>
Polymerization of the reaction mixture can be initiated using the appropriate choice<br>
of heat, visible or ultraviolet light or other means depending on the polymerization<br>
initiator used. Alternatively, initiation can be conducted without a photoinitiator<br>
using, for example, e-beam. However, when a photoinitiator is used, the preferred<br>
initiators are bisacylphosphine oxides, such as bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl<br>
phosphine oxide (Irgacure 819®) or a combination of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl<br>
ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide<br>
(DMBAPO), CGI 1850and the preferred method of polymerization initiation is<br>
visible light.<br>
Suitable solvents include medium to high polarity systems such as toluene,<br>
ethyl acetate, tertiary butyl alcohol, methyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide,<br>
methanol, combinations thereof and the like. Preferable solvents are those which are<br>
readily miscible with hexanes while preparing a polar polymer, and water soluble<br>
solvents while preparing a water immiscible polymer.<br>
The solvent is used in amounts between about 10 and about 90 weight %,<br>
based upon the amounts of all components in the reaction mixture (monomer,<br>
comonomer, photoinitiator, solvent, etc.).<br>
The reaction mixture is degassed prior to the reaction to remove dissolved<br>
oxygen and the reaction is conducted under an inert atmosphere. Polymerization is<br>
completed quickly, generally in times less than about 4 hours and preferably less<br>
than about 2 hours.<br>
The polymers may be isolated by known techniques, such as precipitation in<br>
a non-polar solvent, followed by washing and or reprecipitation processes, and<br>
evaporation of the residual solvent. These methods are well known in the art.<br>
The water soluble polymers may be incorporated into a variety of ophthalmic<br>
solutions and devices. For example, the water soluble polymers of the present<br><br>
invention may be incorporated into eye drops, contact lens rewetting solutions,<br>
contact lens packing and/or cleaning solutions or contact lenses themselves. When<br>
the water soluble polymers are included in solutions, suitable amounts include<br>
between about 50 ppm by weight and about 5 wt%, and preferably between about<br>
100 ppm and about 3 wt%. When the water soluble polymers are included in<br>
contact lenses they may be included in amounts up to about 15 weight % and<br>
preferably in amounts between about 0.05 and about 10 weight %. The ophthalmic<br>
solutions may include known additional components such as tonicity adjusting<br>
agents (such as but not limited to buffers), viscosity adjusting agents, antimicrobial<br>
agents, polyelectrolytes, stabilizers, chelants, antioxidants, combinations thereof and<br>
the like.<br>
The water soluble polymer may be incorporated into a contact lens in a<br>
number of ways, including adding the water soluble polymer to the lens reaction<br>
mixture and curing the mixture to form a lens, or soaking a preformed lens in a<br>
solution comprising the water soluble polymer, coated onto a lens by any method,<br>
including but not limited to grafting, mold transfer, dip coating, spin coating, etc,<br>
combinations thereof and the like.<br>
The water soluble polymer may be incorporated into any contact lens<br>
formulation or used with any contact lens. A variety of formulations are known in<br>
the art and include etafilcon A, galyfilcon A, lotrafilcon A and B, vifilcon,<br>
balafilcon, omafilcon, genfilcon A, lenefilcon A, polymacon, acquafilcon A, and the<br>
like. Other lens formulations using polymerizable components known in the art may<br>
also be used.<br>
The contact lenses may be hard or soft contact lenses. In one embodiment<br>
the contact lenses are soft contact lenses. Soft contact lenses may be made from<br>
conventional hydrophilic formulations or silicone hydrogel formulations.<br>
In one embodiment, the water soluble polymers of the present invention are<br>
incorporated into the hydrogel formulations without significant covalent bonding to<br><br>
the hydrogel. The absence of significant covalent bonding means that while a minor<br>
degree of covalent bonding may be present, it is incidental to the retention of the<br>
wetting agent in the hydrogel matrix. Whatever incidental covalent bonding may be<br>
present, it would not by itself be sufficient to retain the water soluble polymer in the<br>
hydrogel matrix. Instead, the vastly predominating effect keeping the wetting agent<br>
associated with the hydrogel is entrapment. The polymer is "entrapped", according<br>
to this specification, when it is physically retained within a hydrogel matrix. This is<br>
done via entanglement of the polymer chain of the water solublepolymer within the<br>
hydrogel polymer matrix. However, van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole<br>
interactions, electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding can also contribute to this<br>
entrapment to a lesser extent.<br>
The water soluble polymers may be incorporated into the hydrogel by a<br>
variety of methods. For example, the water soluble polymers may be added to the<br>
reaction mixture such that the hydrogel polymerizes "around" the water soluble<br>
polymer, forming a semi-interpenetrating network. Alternatively, the water soluble<br>
polymer may be included in the solution in which the lens is packaged. The water<br>
soluble polymer permeates into the lens. The packaged lens may be heat treated to<br>
increase the amount of water soluble polymer which permeates the lens. Suitable<br>
heat treatments, include, but are not limited to conventional heat sterilization cycles,<br>
which include temperatures of about 120°C for times of about 20 minutes. If heat<br>
sterilization is not used, the packaged lens may be separately heat treated.<br>
Alternatively, the water soluble polymers may be included in a coating<br>
formulation and coated onto at least a portion of an ophthalmic device, and in one<br>
embodiment a contact lens via suitable coating method, such as dip coating, mold<br>
transfer, spin coating, grafting.<br>
The non-limiting examples below further describe this invention.<br>
The dynamic contact angle or DCA, was measured at 23°C, with borate<br>
buffered saline, using a Wilhelmy balance. The wetting force between the lens<br><br>
surface and borate buffered saline is measured using a Wilhelmy microbalance while<br>
the sample strip cut from the center portion of the lens is being immersed into the<br>
saline at a rate of 100 microns/sec . The following equation is used<br><br>
where F is the wetting force, y is the surface tension of the probe liquid, p is the<br>
perimeter of the sample at the meniscus and 9 is the contact angle. Typically, two<br>
contact angles are obtained from a dynamic wetting experiment - advancing contact<br>
angle and receding contact angle. Advancing contact angle is obtained from the<br>
portion of the wetting experiment where the sample is being immersed into the<br>
probe liquid, and these are the values reported herein. At least four lenses of each<br>
composition are measured and the average is reported.<br>
The water content was measured as follows: lenses to be tested were allowed<br>
to sit in packing solution for 24 hours. Each of three test lens were removed from<br>
packing solution using a sponge tipped swab and placed on blotting wipes which<br>
have been dampened with packing solution. Both sides of the lens were contacted<br>
with the wipe. Using tweezers, the test lens were placed in a weighing pan and<br>
weighed. The two more sets of samples were prepared and weighed as above. The<br>
pan was weighed three times and the average is the wet weight.<br>
The dry weight was measured by placing the sample pans in a vacuum<br>
oven which has been preheated to 60°C for 30 minutes. Vacuum was applied until<br>
at least 0.4 inches Hg is attained. The vacuum valve and pump were turned off and<br>
the lenses were dried for four hours. The purge valve was opened and the oven was<br>
allowed reach atmospheric pressure. The pans were removed and weighed. The<br>
water content was calculated as follows:<br>
Wet weight = combined wet weight of pan and lenses - weight of weighing pan<br>
Dry weight = combined dry weight of pan and lens - weight of weighing pan<br>
% water content = (wet weight - dry weight) x 100<br>
wet weight<br><br>
The average and standard deviation of the water content are calculated for<br>
the samples are reported.<br>
Modulus and elongation were measured by using the crosshead of a constant<br>
rate of movement type tensile testing machine equipped with a load cell that is<br>
lowered to the initial gauge height. A suitable testing machine includes an Instron<br>
model 1122. A dog-bone shaped sample having a 0.522 inch length, 0.276 inch<br>
"ear" width and 0.213 inch "neck" width was loaded into the grips and elongated at<br>
a constant rate of strain of 2 in/min. until it broke. The initial gauge length of the<br>
sample (Lo) and sample length at break (Lf) were measured. Twelve specimens of<br>
each composition were measured and the average is reported. Tensile modulus was<br>
measured at the initial linear portion of the stress/strain curve.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
The following compounds in the following amounts were mixed to form a<br>
homogenous mixture.<br>
mPEG350	59.66g<br>
Norbloc 7966	340mg<br>
CGI 1850	400mg<br>
Isopropyl acetate	100mL<br>
The homogeneous mixture was degassed under a vacuum of 80mm Hg over a period<br>
of one hour. The vacuum was interrupted with a positive nitrogen flow on three to<br>
four occasions during the degassing process. The material was moved to a glove<br>
box, which was under a nitrogen environment. The mixture was transferred to a<br>
crystallizing dish and covered with a watch glass. The system was then exposed to<br>
visible light (Philips type T103 bulbs) for one hour at room temperature to form the<br>
desired polymer.<br>
The polymer was precipitated by the addition of 50mL of hexanes followed<br>
by vigorous agitation. The solvent and any soluble material was decanted. Further<br>
washes were performed using 300mL of hexanes followed by thorough mixing and<br>
decantation of the liquids. The washing process was continued until the polymer<br>
appeared tacky and very thick.<br>
The product was dissolved in 50mL of ethyl acetate and reprecipitated by the<br>
addition of hexanes to the system. The wash process described above was repeated<br>
and the product was rid of all solvent in a rotary evaporator at 55°C. Yield of the<br>
desired product was 39g. The material was obtained as a clear, thick paste whose<br>
average molecular weight was determined to be 25000 by GPC.<br>
Example 2<br>
The following compounds in the following amounts were mixed to form a<br>
homogenous mixture.<br><br>
mPEG 475	45g<br>
tertbutyl alcohol 70mL<br>
Norbloc	75mg<br>
CGI1850	300mg<br>
The homogeneous mixture was degassed for 1 hour under a pressure of 100mm<br>
Hg. The system was purged with nitrogen every 15 minutes during the degassing<br>
process. The reaction mixture was transferred to a glove box under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere and into 110 ID x 175 OD x 70 mm height silvered crystallizing dish.<br>
The dish was placed on a shelf approximately 115mm from the light source (visible<br>
light bulbs, Philips - TL03). The vessel was covered with a 2mm thick filter cover<br>
(Schott, VG-6, 339732) and the reactants were polymerized for one hour at room<br>
temperature.<br>
The polymer was precipitated in a beaker flask (Buchi - 450mL) with 100mL of<br>
hexanes and vigorous agitation. The liquids were decanted and the polymer was<br>
washed twice with 100mL of hexanes each time. The residual solid was then<br>
dissolved in 50mL of ethyl acetate, reprecipitated and washed with hexanes as<br>
described above. The ethyl acetate/hexanes sequence was repeated once more and<br>
some of the crude product (2-4g) removed, dried under reduced pressure, and in a<br>
vacuum oven at 50°C prior to obtaining molecular weight data by GPC.<br>
An accurately weighed amount (W1) of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)<br>
was added to the beaker flask (approximately 250g) and the system is gently mixed<br>
on a rotary evaporator until the system is completely homogeneous. The bath was<br>
then heated at 40°C under a vacuum of 10-15mbar. The evaporation was continued<br>
for two hours after the point at which no solvent was being distilled over.<br>
The weight of the beaker flask and solution was accurately measured (W2 =<br>
weight of flask + polymer + HEMA). After transferring the solution to an<br>
appropriate container, the beaker flask was thoroughly cleaned, dried, and accurately<br>
weighed (W3 = weight of beaker flask).<br>
W2-W3 - weight of HEMA + polymer = W4<br><br>
W4 - W1 = total yield of polymer = W5 (typical yield = 45%)<br>
Concentration of the polymer solution (weight percent) was determined as<br>
W5/(W4). Molecular weights (Mn) were determined against polymethyl<br>
methacrylate (PMMA) standards to be greater than about 300,000.<br>
Example 3<br>
One weight% of the polymer of Example 1 was added to Packing Solution.<br>
5 ml of the Packing Solution polymer mixture was places in glass vials, and a 1-Day<br>
ACUVUE brand contact lens (commercially available from Johnson &amp; Johnson)<br>
was placed in the vial. The vial was sealed and autoclaved at 121°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The lenses were allowed to equilibrate after autoclaving for at least about 1 day at<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
Five subjects were recruited to wear the test lens in one eye and the control<br>
lens in their other eye. The lenses were allowed to settle for 30-minutes prior to any<br>
observations.<br>
After 30 minutes, the non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT) and lipid<br>
layer thickness were observed for both lenses using the Tearscope Plus™ (Keeler).<br>
The test lens was found to have a longer NIBUT than the control lens (10.4 seconds<br>
vs. 7.6 seconds). The test lens was also found to have a thicker lipid layer than the<br>
control lens in 4 of the 5 of the subjects.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
The copolymer (MM-44) formed in Example 2 was used as a monomer<br>
component in the formulation listed in Table 3, below. .<br><br>
The components were mixed in a glass jar with 40 weight % boric acid<br>
glyceryl ester, sealed and rolled on a jar roller until homogeneous.<br>
The lenses were were made on a single cavity lens machine utilizing<br>
polystyrene + 1% zinc front curve and back curve lens molds. Monomer was dosed<br>
into the front curve, back curve was deposited, and parts were placed under pre-cure<br>
lights for 10 seconds. Molds were cured for 4 minutes at approximately 4 mW/cm2<br>
and 65°C. Lenses were demolded and placed into leach solution at 70±5°C for<br>
180±30 minutes, followed by rinse at 45±5°C for 15 to 60 minutes and equilibration<br>
at 45±5°C for a minimum of 3 hours. Lenses were visually inspected, packaged in<br>
vials with packing solution and sterilized for 30 minutes at 121 °C. Physical<br>
properties were measured for the lenses and are shown in Table 4, below.<br><br><br><br>
Thirty myopic, current soft contact lens wearers were recruited to wear test<br>
lenses and control lenses (1-DAY ACUVUE). Each lens type was worn daily wear<br>
for 1-week and replaced on a daily disposable basis. The study design was a<br>
randomized, bilateral cross-over design with investigator masking. Twenty-nine<br>
subjects completed the study.<br>
After wearing the lenses for 1-week, the subjects completed preference<br>
questionnaires comparing their experiences with both lens types. The lenses from<br>
this Example 4 were preferred 2:1 over 1-DAY ACUVUE® in the areas of overall<br>
comfort, end of day comfort, dryness, wearing time, and moisture. Symptoms<br>
reported by the subjects at the 1-week visit were reduced for the test lenses by 50%<br>
compared to the control lens.<br><br>
