predetermined input stream to bit data and a Low density parity bit scheme (LDPC)<br>
decoder for performing afirst error correction decoding of the demapped bit data based<br>
on the LDPC scheme. The TFS frame may include a first pilot signal and a second<br>
pilot signal located at the beginning part for transmission parameter.<br>
[8] The apparatus may further include a time deinterleaver for performing deinterleaving<br>
in the time domain of the output predetermined input stream from the parser. The<br>
apparatus may further include a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) decoder for<br>
performing asecond error correction decoding of the first error correction decoded bit<br>
data based on the BCH scheme. The TFS frame includes at least one RF band and at<br>
least one input stream on each RF band.<br>

terleaved broadcasting signals, outputting a predetermined input stream among the<br>
frequency-deinterleaved broadcasting signals based on the parsed result, demapping<br>
symbols corresponding to the output predetermined input stream to bit data and<br>
performing a first error correction decoding of the demapped bit data based on a low<br>
density parity bit scheme (LDPC).<br>
[10] The method may further include performing deinterleaving in the time domain of the<br>
output predetermined input stream. The method may further include performing dein-<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[43] In the following description, the term "service" is indicative of either broadcast<br>
contents which can be transmitted by the signal transmitting/receiving apparatus, or<br>
content provision.<br>
[44] Prior to describing embodiments of the signal transmitting/receiving apparatus<br>
according to the present invention, a signal frame transmitted/received by the signal<br>
transmitting/receiving apparatus will hereinafter be described.<br>
[45] FIG. 1 shows a signal frame for transmitting a service according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[46] The signal frame shown in FIG. 1 shows an exemplary signal frame for transmitting<br>
a broadcast service including audio/video (A/V) streams. In this case, a single service<br>
is multiplexed in time- and frequency- channels, and the multiplexed service is<br>
transmitted. The above-mentioned signal transmission scheme is called a time-<br>
frequency slicing (TFS) scheme. Compared with the conventional art in which a single<br>
service is transmitted to a single radio frequency (RF) band, the signal transmission<br>
apparatus according to the present invention transmits the signal service via several RF<br>
bands, such that it can acquire a statistical multiplexing gain capable of transmitting<br>
many more services. The signal transmission/reception apparatus transmits a single<br>
service over several RF channels, such that it can acquire a frequency diversity gain.<br>
[47] First to third services (Services 1-3) are transmitted to four RF hands (RF1-RF4).<br>
However, this number of RF bands and this number of services have been disclosed for<br>
only illustrative purposes, such that other numbers may also be used as necessary. Two<br>
reference signals (i.e., a first pilot signal (P1) and a second pilot signal (P2)) are<br>
located at the beginning part of the signal frame. For example, in the case of the RF1<br>
band, the first pilot signal (P1) and the second pilot signal (P2) are located at the<br>
beginning part of the signal frame. The RF1 band includes three slots associated with<br>
the Service 1, two slots associated with the Service 2, and a single slot associated with<br>
the Service 3. Slots associated with other services may also be located in other slots<br>
(Slots 4-17) located after the single slot associated with the Service 3.<br>
[48] The RF2 band includes a first pilot signal (P1), a second pilot signal (P2), and other<br>
slots 13-17. In addition, the RF2 band includes three slots associated with the Service<br>
1, two slots associated with the Service 2, and a single slot associated with the Service<br>
3.<br>
[49] The Services 1-3 are multiplexed, and are then transmitted to the RF3 and RF4<br>
bands according to the time-frequency slicing (TFS) scheme. The modulation scheme<br>
for signal transmission may be based on an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme.<br>
[50] In the signal frame, individual services are shifted to the RF bands and a time axis.<br>
[51] If signal frames equal to the above signal frame are successively arranged in time, a<br>
super-frame can be composed of several signal frames. A future extension frame may<br>
also be located among the several signal frames. If the future extension frame is<br>
located among the several signal frames, the super-frame may be terminated at the<br>
future extension frame.<br>
[52] FIG. 2 shows a first pilot signal (P1) contained in the signal frame of FIG. 1<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[53] The first pilot signal P1 and the second pilot signal P2 are located at the beginning<br>
part of the signal frame. The first pilot signal P1 is modulated by a 2K FFT mode, and<br>
may be transmitted simultaneously while including a 1/4 guard interval. In FIG. 2, a<br>
band of 7.61Mhz of the first pilot signal Plincludes a band of 6.82992Mhz. The first<br>
pilot signal uses 256 carriers from among 1705 active carriers. A single active carrier<br>
is used for every 6 carriers on average. Data-carrier intervals may be irregularly<br>
arranged in the order of 3, 6, and 9. In FIG. 2, a solid line indicates the location of a<br>
used carrier, a thin dotted line indicates the location of an unused carrier, and a chain<br>
line indicates a center location of the unused carrier. In the first pilot signal, the used<br>
carrier can be symbol-mapped by a binary phase shift keying (BPSK), and a pseudo-<br>
random bit sequence (PRBS) can be modulated. The size of a FFT used for the second<br>
pilot signal can be indicated by several PRBSs.<br>
[54] The signal reception apparatus detects a structure of a pilot signal, and recognizes a<br>
time-frequency slicing (TFS) using the detected structure. The signal reception<br>
apparatus acquires the FFT size of the second pilot signal, compensates for a coarse<br>
frequency offset of a reception signal, and acquires time synchronization.<br>
[55] A transmission type and basic transmission parameters can be established in the first<br>
pilot signal.<br>
[56] The second pilot signal P2 may be transmitted with a FFT size and a guard interval<br>
equal to those of the data symbol. In the second pilot signal, a single carrier is used as a<br>
pilot carrier at intervals of three carriers. The signal reception apparatus compensates<br>
for a fine frequency synchronization offset using the second pilot signal, and performs<br>
fine time synchronization. The second pilot signal transmits information of a first layer<br>
(L1) from among Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers. For example, the second<br>
pilot signal may include a physical parameter and frame construction information. The<br>
second pilot signal transmits a parameter value by which a receiver can access a<br>
Physical Layer Pipe (PLP) service stream.<br>
[57] L1 (Layer 1) information contained in the second pilot signal P2 is as follows.<br>
[58] The Layer-1 (L1) information includes a length indicator indicating the lengthof data<br>
including the L1 information, such that it can easily use the signaling channels of<br>
Layers 1 and 2 (L1 and L2). The Layer-1 (L1) information includes a frequency<br>
indicator, a guard-interval length, a maximum number of FEC (Forward Error<br>
Correction) blocks for each frame in association with individual physical channels, and<br>
the number of actual FEC blocks to be contained in the FEC block buffer associated<br>
with a current/previous frame in each physical channel. In this case, the frequency<br>
indicator indicates frequency information corresponding to the RF channel.<br>
[59] The Layer-1 (L1) information may include a variety of information in association<br>
with individual slots. For example, the Layer-1 (L1) information includes the number<br>
of frames associated with a service, a start address of a slot having the accuracy of an<br>
OFDM carrier contained in an OFDM symbol, a length of the slot, slots corresponding<br>
tothe OFDM carrier, the number of bits padded in the last OFDM carrier, service<br>
modulation information, service mode rate information, and Multi-Input-Multi-Output<br>
(MIMO) scheme information.<br>
[60] The Layer-1 (L1) information may include a cell ID, a flagfor service like noti-<br>
fication message service(e.g., an emergency message), the number of current frames,<br>
and the number of additional bits for future use. In this case, the cell ID indicates a<br>
broadcast area transmitted by a broadcast transmitter<br>
[61] The second pilot signal P2 is adapted to perform channel estimation for decoding a<br>
symbol contained in the P2 signal. The second pilot signal P2 can be used as an initial<br>
value for channel estimation for the next data symbol. The second pilot signal P2 may<br>
also transmit Layer-2 (L2) information. For example, the second pilot signal is able to<br>
describe information associated with the transmission service in Layer-2 (L2) in-<br>
formation. The signal transmission apparatus decodes the second pilot signal, such that<br>
it can acquire service information contained in the time-frequency slicing (TFS) frame<br>
and can effectively perform the channel scanning. Meanwhile, this Layer-2 (L2) in-<br>
formation may be included in a specific PLP of the TFS frame. According to another<br>
instance, L2 information can be included in a specific PLP, and the service description<br>
information also can be transmitted in the specific PLP.<br>
[62] For example, the second pilot signal may include two OFDM symbols of the 8k FFT<br>
mode. Generally, the second pilot signal may be any one of a single OFDM symbol of<br>
the 32K FFT mode, a single OFDM symbol of the 16k FFT mode, two OFDM<br>
symbols of the 8k FFT mode, four OFDM symbols of the 4k FFT mode, and eight<br>
OFDM symbols of the 2k FFT mode.<br>
[63] In other words, a single OFDM symbol having the size of a large FFT or several<br>
OFDM symbols, each of which has the size of a small FFT, may be contained in the<br>
second pilot signal P2, such that capacity capable of being transmitted to the pilot can<br>
be maintained.<br>
[64] If information to be transmitted to the second pilot signal exceeds capacity of the<br>
OFDM symbol of the second pilot signal, OFDM symbols after the second pilot signal<br>
can be further used. L1 (Layerl) and L2 (Layer2) information contained in the second<br>
pilot signal is error-correction-coded and is then interleaved, such that data recovery is<br>
carried out although an impulse noise occurs. As described the above, L2 information<br>
can also be included in a specific PLP conveying the service description information.<br>
[65] FIG. 3 shows a signaling window according to the present invention. The time-<br>
frequency slicing (TFS) frame shows an offset concept of the signaling information.<br>
Layer-1 (L1) information contained in the second pilot signal includes frame con-<br>
struction information and physical layer information required by the signal reception<br>
apparatus decoding the data symbol. Therefore, if information of the following data<br>
symbols located after the second pilot signal, is contained in the second pilot signal,<br>
and the resultant second pilot signal is transmitted, the signal reception apparatus may<br>
be unable to immediately decode the above following data symbols due to a decoding<br>
time of the second pilot signal.<br>
[66] Therefore, as shown in FIG. 3, the L1 information contained in the second pilot<br>
signal (P2) includes information of a single time-frequency slicing (TFS) frame size,<br>
and includes information contained in the signaling window at a location spaced apart<br>
from the second pilot signal by the signaling window offset.<br>
[67] In the meantime, in order to perform channel estimation of a data symbol con-<br>
structing the service, the data symbol may include a scatter pilot and a continual pilot.<br>
[68] The signal transmission/reception system capable of transmitting/receiving signal<br>
frames shown in FIGS. 1-3 will hereinafter be described. Individual services can be<br>
transmitted and received over several RF channels. A path for transmitting the in-<br>
dividual services or a stream transmitted via this path is called a PLP.<br>
[69] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for transmitting a signal according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, the signal<br>
transmission apparatus includes an input processor 110, a coding and modulation unit<br>
120, a frame builder 130, aMIMO/MISO encoder 140, a plurality of modulators (150a,<br>
..., 150r) of the MIMO/MISO encoder 140, and a plurality of analog processors<br>
(160a,...,160r).<br>
[70] The input processor 110 receives streams equipped with several services, generates P<br>
number of baseband frames (P is a natural number) which includes modulation- and<br>
coding- information corresponding to transmission paths of the individual services, and<br>
outputs the P number of baseband frames.<br>
[71] The coding and modulation unit 120 receives baseband frames from the input<br>
processor 110, performs the channel coding and interleaving on each of the baseband<br>
frames, and outputs the channel coding and interleaving result.<br>
[72] The frame builder 130 forms frames which transmit baseband frames contained in P<br>
number of PLPs to R number of RF channels (where R is a natural number), splits the<br>
formed frames, and outputs the split frames to paths corresponding to the R number of<br>
RF channels. Several services may be multiplexed in a single RF channel in time. The<br>
signal frames generated from the frame builder 140 may include a time-frequency<br>
slicing (TFS) structure in which the service is multiplexed in time- and frequency-<br>
domains.<br>
[73] The MEMO/MISO encoder 140 encodes signals to be transmitted to the R number of<br>
RF channels, and outputs the coded signals to paths corresponding to A number of<br>
antennas (where A is a natural number). The MIMO/MISO encoder 140 outputs the<br>
coded signal in which a single to be transmitted to a single RF channel is encoded to<br>
the A number of antennas, such that a signal is transmitted/received to/from a MTMO<br>
(Multi-Input-Multi-Output) or MISO (Multi-Input-Single-Output) structure.<br>
[74] The modulators (150a,..., 150r) modulate frequency-domain signals entered via the<br>
path corresponding to each RF channel into time-domain signals. The modulators<br>
(150a,..., 150r) modulate the input signals according to an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and outputs the modulated signals.<br>
[75] The analog processors (160a,..., 160r) converts the input signals into RF signals,<br>
such that the RF signals can be outputted to the RF channels.<br>
[76] The signal transmission apparatus according to this embodiment may include a pre-<br>
determined number of modulators (150a,... 150r) corresponding to the number of RF<br>
channels and a predetermined number of analog processors (160a,...,160r) corre-<br>
sponding to the number of RF channels. However, in the case of using the MIMO<br>
scheme, the number of analog processors must be equal to the product of R (i.e., the<br>
number of RF channels) and A (i.e., the number of antennas).<br>
[77] FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an input processor 110 according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 5, the input processor 110 includes the first stream mul-<br>
tiplexer 11 la, the first service splitter 113a, and a plurality of first baseband (BB)<br>
frame builders (115a,..., 115m). The input processor 110 includes a second stream<br>
multiplexer 11 lb, a second service splitter 113b, and a plurality of second baseband<br>
(BB) frame builders (115n,..., 115p).<br>
[78] For example, the first stream multiplexer Ilia receives several MPEG-2 transport<br>
streams (TSs), multiplexes the received MPEG-2 TS streams, and outputs the mul-<br>
tiplexed MPEG-2 TS streams. The first service splitter 113a receives the multiplexed<br>
streams, splits the input streams of individual services, and outputs the split streams.<br>
As described above, provided that the service transmitted via a physical-channel path<br>
is called a PLP, the first service splitter 113a splits the service to be transmitted to each<br>
PLP, and outputs the split service.<br>
[79] The first BB frame builders (115a,..., 115m)build data contained in a service to be<br>
transmitted to each PLP in the form of a specific frame, and output the specific-<br>
frame-formatted data. The first BB frame builders (115a,..., 115m) build a frame<br>
including a header and payload equipped with service data. The header of each frame<br>
may include mode information based on the modulation and encoding of the service<br>
data, and a counter value based on a clock rate of the modulator to synchronize input<br>
streams.<br>
[80] The second stream multiplexer 111b receives several streams, multiplexes input<br>
streams, and outputs the multiplexed streams. For example, the second stream mul-<br>
tiplexer 111b may multiplex Internet Protocol (IP) streams instead of the MPEG-2 TS<br>
streams. These streams may be encapsulated by a generic stream encapsulation (GSE)<br>
scheme. The streams multiplexed by the second stream multiplexer 111b may be any<br>
one of streams. Therefore, the above-mentioned streams different from the MPEG-2<br>
TS streams are called generic streams (GS streams).<br>
[81] The second service splitter 113b receives the multiplexed generic streams, splits the<br>
received generic streams according to individual services (i.e., PLP types), and outputs<br>
the split GS streams.<br>
[82] The second BB frame builders (115n,..., 115p) build service data to be transmitted to<br>
individual PLPs in the form of a specific frame used as a signal processing unit, and<br>
output the resultant service data. The frame format built by the second BB frame<br>
builders (115n,..., 115p) may be equal to that of the first BB frame builders (115a,...,<br>
115m) as necessary. If required, another embodiment may also be proposed. In another<br>
embodiment, the frame format built by the second BB frame builders (115n,..., 115p)<br>
may be differentfrom that of the first BB frame builders (115a,..., 115m). The MPEG-<br>
2 TS header further includes a Packet Syncword which is not contained in the GS<br>
stream, resulting in the occurrence of different headers.<br>
[83] FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a coding and modulation unit according to the<br>
present invention. The coding and modulation unit includes a first interleaver 123, a<br>
second encoder 125, and a second interleaver 127.<br>
[84] The first encoder 121 acts as an outer coder of the input baseband frame, and is able<br>
to perform the error correction encoding. The first encoder 121 performs the error<br>
correction encoding of the input baseband frame using a Bose-<br>
Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) scheme. The first interleaver 123 performs in-<br>
terleaving of the encoded data, such that it prevents a burst error from being generated<br>
in a transmission signal. The first interleaver 123 may not be contained in the above-<br>
mentioned embodiment.<br>
[85] The second encoder 125 acts as an inner coder of either the output data of the first<br>
encoder 121 or the output data of the first interleaver 123, and is able to perform the<br>
error correction encoding. A low density parity bit (LDPC) scheme may be used as an<br>
error correction encoding scheme. The second interleaver 127 mixes the error-<br>
correction-encoded data generated from the second encoder 125, and outputs the mixed<br>
data. The first interleaver 123 and the second interleaver 127 are able to perform in-<br>
terleaving of data in units of a bit.<br>
[86] The coding and modulation unit 120 relates to a single PLP stream. The PLP stream<br>
is error-correction-encoded and modulated by the coding and modulation unit 120, and<br>
is then transmitted to the frame builder 130.<br>
[87] FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a frame builder according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 7, the frame builder 130 receives streams of several paths<br>
from the coding and modulation unit 120, and arranges the received streams in a single<br>
signal frame. For example, the frame builder may include a first mapper 131a and a<br>
first time interleaver 132a in a first path, and may include a second mapper 13 lb and a<br>
second time interleaver 132b in a second path. The number of input paths is equal to<br>
the number of PLPs for service transmission or the number of streams transmitted via<br>
each PLP.<br>
[88] The first mapper 131a performs mapping of data contained in the input stream<br>
according to the first symbol mapping scheme. For example, the first mapper 131a<br>
may perform mapping of the input data using a QAM scheme (e.g., 16 QAM, 64<br>
QAM, and 256 QAM).<br>
[89] If the first mapper 131a performs mapping of the symbol, the input data may be<br>
mapped to several kinds of symbols according to several symbol mapping schemes.<br>
For example, the first mapper 131a classifies the input data into a baseband-frame unit<br>
and a baseband-frame sub-unit. Individual classified data may be hybrid-<br>
symbol-mapped by at least two QAM schemes (e.g., 16 QAM and 64 QAM).<br>
Therefore, data contained in a single service may be mapped to symbols based on<br>
different symbol mapping schemes in individual intervals.<br>
[90] The first time interleaver 132a receives a symbol sequence mapped by the first<br>
mapper 131a, and is able to perform the interleaving in a time domain. The first<br>
mapper 131a maps data, which is contained in the error-corrected frame unit received<br>
from the coding and modulation unit 120, into symbols. The first time interleaver 132a<br>
receives the symbol sequence mapped by the first mapper 131a, and interleaves the<br>
received symbol sequence in units of the error-corrected frame.<br>
[91] In this way, the p-th mapper 131p or the p-th time interleaver 132p receives service<br>
data to be transmitted to the p-th PLP, maps the service data into symbols according to<br>
the p-th symbol mapping scheme. The mapped symbols can be interleaved in a time<br>
domain. It should be noted that this symbol mapping scheme and this interleaving<br>
scheme are equal to those of the first time interleaver 132a and the first mapper 131a.<br>
[92] The symbol mapping scheme of the first mapper 131a may be equal to or different<br>
from that of the p-th mapper 131p. The first mapper 131a and the p-th mapper 131p are<br>
able to map input data to individual symbols using the same or different hybrid symbol<br>
mapping schemes.<br>
[93] Data of the time interleavers located at individual paths (i.e., service data interleaved<br>
by the first time interleaver 132a and service data to be transmitted to R number of RF<br>
channels by the p-thtime interleaver 132p) is interleaved, such that the physical<br>
channel allows the above data to be interleaved over several RF channels.<br>
[94] In association with streams received in as many paths as the number of PLPs, the<br>
TFS frame builder 133builds the TFS signal frame such as the above-mentioned signal<br>
frame, such that the service is time-shifted according to RF channels. The TFS frame<br>
builder 133 splits service data received in any one of paths, and outputs the service<br>
data split into data of the R number of RF bands according to a signal scheduling<br>
scheme.<br>
[95] The TFS frame builder 133 receives the first pilot signal and the second pilot signal<br>
from the signaling information unit (denoted by Ref/PL signal) 137, arranges the first<br>
and second pilot signals in the signal frame, and inserts the signaling signal (LI and<br>
L2) of the above-mentioned physical layer in the second pilot signal. In this case,<br>
thefirst and second pilot signals are used as the beginning signals of the signal frame<br>
contained in each RF channel from among the TFS signal frame received from the<br>
signaling information unit (Ref/PL signal) 137. As shown in FIG. 2, the first pilot<br>
signal may include a transmission type and basic transmission parameters, and the<br>
second pilot signal may include a physical parameter and frame construction in-<br>
formation. Also, the second pilot signal includes a L1 (Layer 1) signaling signal and a<br>
L2 (Layer 2) signaling signal. Network information (hereinafter illustrated as NIT)<br>
including the RF construction information is transmitted via the L1 signaling signal.<br>
Service description information (hereinafter illustrated as SDT) for providing service<br>
information is transmitted via the L2 signaling signal. Meanwhile, the L2 signaling<br>
signal including the service description information can also be transmitted in the<br>
specific PLP.<br>
[96] The R number of frequency interleavers (137a,..., 137r) interleave service data, to be<br>
transmitted to corresponding RF channels of the TFS signal frame, in a frequency<br>
domain. The frequency interleavers (137a,..., 137r) can interleave the service data at a<br>
level of data cells contained in an OFDM symbol.<br>
[97] Therefore, service data to be transmitted to each RF channel in the TFS signal frame<br>
is frequency-selective-fading-processed, such that it may not be lost in a specific<br>
frequency domain.<br>
[98] FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a MIMO/MISO encoder according to the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 8, the MIMO/MISO encoder encodes the input<br>
data using the MIMO/MISO encoding scheme, and outputs the encoded data to several<br>
paths. If a signal reception end receives the signal transmitted to the several paths from<br>
one or more paths, it is able to acquire a gain (also called a diversity gain, a payload<br>
gain, or a multiplexing gain).<br>
[99] The MIMO/MISO encoder 140 encodes service data of each path generated from the<br>
frame builder 130, and outputs the encoded data to the A number of paths corre-<br>
sponding to the number of output antennas.<br>
[100] FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating a modulator according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the modulator includes a first power controller (PAPR Reduce 1)<br>
151, a time-domain transform unit (IFFT) 153, a second power controller (PAPR<br>
Reduce2) 157, and a guard-interval inserter 159.<br>
[101] The first power controller 151 reduces a PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio) of<br>
data transmitted to the R number of signal paths in the frequency domain.<br>
[102] The time-domain transform (IFFT) unit 153 converts the received frequency-domain<br>
signals into time-domain signals. For example, the frequency-domain signals may be<br>
converted into the time-domain signals according to the IFFT algorithm. Therefore, the<br>
frequency-domain data may be modulated according to the OFDM scheme.<br>
[103] The second power controller (PAPR Reduce2) 157reduces a PAPR (Peak-to-Average<br>
Power Ratio) of channel data transmitted to the R number of signal paths in the time<br>
domain. In this case, a tone reservation scheme, and an active constellation extension<br>
(ACE) scheme for extending symbol constellation can be used.<br>
[104] The guard-interval inserter 159 inserts the guard interval into the output OFDM<br>
symbol, and outputs the inserted result. As described above, the above-mentioned em-<br>
bodiment can be carried out in each signal of the R number of paths.<br>
[105] FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating an analog processor 160 according to the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 10, the analog processor 160 includes a digital-<br>
to-analog converter (DAC) 161, an up-conversion unit 163, and an analog filter 165.<br>
[106] The DAC 161 converts the input data into an analog signal, and outputs the analog<br>
signal. The up-conversion unit 163 converts a frequency domain of the analog signal<br>
into an RF area. The analog filter 165 filters the RF-area signal, and outputs the filtered<br>
RF signal.<br>
[107] FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for receiving a signal according<br>
to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, the signal reception apparatus includes a<br>
first signal receiver 210a, ann-th signal receiver 2 lOn, a first demodulator 220a, an n-th<br>
demodulator 220n, a MIMO/MISO decoder 230, a frame parser 240, and a decoding<br>
demodulator 250, and an output processor 260.<br>
[108] In the case of a reception signal according to the TFS signal frame structure, several<br>
services are multiplexed to R channels, and are then time-shifted, such that the time-<br>
shifted result is transmitted.<br>
[109] The receiver may include at least one signal receiver for receiving a service<br>
transmitted over at least one RF channel. The TFS signal frame transmitted to the R<br>
(where R is a natural number) number of RF channels can be transmitted to a multi-<br>
path via the A number of antennas. The A antennas have been used for the R RF<br>
channels, such that a total number of antennas is R x A.<br>
[110] The first signal receiver 210a is able to receive service data transmitted via at least<br>
one path from among overall service data transmitted via several RF channels. For<br>
example, the first signal receiver 210a can receive the transmission signal processed by<br>
the MIMO/MISO scheme via several paths.<br>
[111] The first signal receiver 210a and the n-th signal receiver 210n can receive several<br>
service data units transmitted over n number of RF channels from among several RF<br>
channels, asa single PLP. Namely, this embodiment shows the signal reception<br>
apparatus capable of simultaneously receiving data of the R number of RF channels.<br>
Therefore, if this embodiment receives a single RF channel, only the first receiver 210a<br>
is needed.<br>
[112] The first demodulator 220a and the n-th demodulator 220n demodulate signals<br>
received in the first and n-th signal receivers 210a and 210n according to the OFDM<br>
scheme, and output the demodulated signals.<br>
[113] The MIMO/MISO decoder 230 decodes service data received via several<br>
transmission paths according to the MEMO/MISO decoding scheme, and outputs the<br>
decoded service data to a single transmission path. If the number R of services<br>
transmitted over several transmission paths are received, the MIMO/MISO decoder<br>
230 can output single PLP service data contained in each of R services corresponding<br>
to the number of R channels. If P number of services are transmitted via the R<br>
numberof RF channels, and signals of individual RF channels are received via the A<br>
number of antennas, the receiver decodes the P number of services using a total of (R x<br>
A) reception antennas.<br>
[114] The frame parser 240 parses the TFS signal frame including several services, and<br>
outputs the parsed service data.<br>
[115] The decoding demodulator 250 performs the error correction decoding on the service<br>
data contained in the parsed frame, demaps the decoded symbol data into bit data, and<br>
outputs the demapping-processed result.<br>
[116] The output processor 260 decodes a stream including the demapped bit data, and<br>
outputs the decoded stream.<br>
[117] In the above-mentioned description, each of the frame parser 240, and the decoding<br>
demodulator 250, and the output processor 260 receives several service data units as<br>
many as the number of PLPs, and performs signal processing on the received service<br>
data.<br>
[118] FIG. 12 is a block diagram illustrating a signal receiver according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 12, the signal receiver may include a tuner 211, adown-<br>
converter 213, and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 215.<br>
[119] The tuner 211 performs hopping of some RF channels capable of transmitting user-<br>
selected services in all RF channels, and outputs the hopping result. The tuner 211<br>
performs hopping of RF channels contained in the TFS signal frame according to an<br>
input RF center frequency, and at the same time tunes corresponding frequency<br>
signals, such that it outputs the tuned signals. If a signal is transmitted to A number of<br>
multi-paths, the tuner 211 performs the tuning to a corresponding RF channel, and<br>
receives reception signals via the A number of antennas.<br>
[120] The down converter 213 performs down conversion of the RF frequency of the signal<br>
tuned by the tuner 211, and outputs the down-conversion result. The ADC 215<br>
converts an analog signal into a digital signal.<br>
[121] FIG. 13 is a block diagram illustrating a demodulator according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 13, the demodulator includes a frame detector 221, a<br>
frame synchronization unit 222, a guard-interval remover 223, a frequency-domain<br>
transform unit (FFT) 224, a channel estimator 225, a channel equalizer 226, and a<br>
signaling-information extractor 227.<br>
[122] If the demodulator acquires service data transmitted to a single PLP stream, the<br>
following signal demodulation will be carried out. A detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
[123] The frame detector 221 identifies a delivery system of a reception signal. For<br>
example, the frame detector 221 determines whether the reception signal is a DVB-TS<br>
signal or not. And, the frame detector 221 may also determine whether a reception<br>
signal is a TFS signal frame or not. The frame synchronization unit 222 acquires time-<br>
and frequency- domain synchronization of the TFS signal frame.<br>
[124] The guide interval controller 223 removes a guard interval located between OFDM<br>
symbols from the time domain. The frequency-domain converter (FFT) 224 converts a<br>
reception signal into a frequency-domain signal using the FFT algorithm, such that it<br>
acquires frequency-domain symbol data.<br>
[125] The channel estimator 225 performs channel estimation of a reception channel using<br>
a pilot symbol contained in symbol data of the frequency domain. The channel<br>
equalizer 226 performs channel equalization of reception data using channel in-<br>
formation estimated by the channel estimator 225.<br>
[126] The signaling information extractor 227 can extract the signaling information of a<br>
physical layer established in the first and second pilot signals contained in channel-<br>
equalized reception data.<br>
[127] FIG. 14 is a block diagram illustrating a MIMO/MISO decoder according to the<br>
present invention. The signal receiver and the demodulator are designed to process a<br>
signal received in a single path. If the signal receiver and the demodulator receive PLP<br>
service data providing a single service via several paths of several antennas, and de-<br>
modulate the PLP service data, the MIMO/MIMO decoder 230 outputs the signal<br>
received in several paths as servicedata transmitted to a single PLP. Therefore, the<br>
MIMO/MISO decoder 230 can acquire a diversity gain and a multiplexing gain from<br>
service data received in a corresponding PLP.<br>
[128] The MIMO/MISO decoder 230 receives a multi-path transmission signal from<br>
several antennas, and is able to decode a signal using a MfMO scheme capable of re-<br>
covering each reception signal in the form of a single signal. Otherwise, the MIMO/<br>
MISO decoder 230 is able to recover a signal using a MIMO scheme which receives<br>
the multi-path transmission signal from a single antenna and recovers the received<br>
multi-path transmission signal.<br>
[129] Therefore, if the signal is transmitted via the R number of RF channels (where R is a<br>
natural number), the MIMO/MISO decoder 230 can decode signals received via the A<br>
number of antennas of individual RF channels. If the A value is equal to " 1", the<br>
signals can be decoded by the MISO scheme. If the A value is higher than "1", the<br>
signals can be decoded by the MIMO scheme.<br>
[130] FIG. 15 is a block diagram illustrating a frame parser according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 15, the frame parser includes a first frequency de-<br>
interleaver 241a, a r-th frequency de-interleaver241r, a frame parser 243, a first time<br>
de-interleaver 245a, a p-th time de-interleaver245p, a first symbol demapper 247a, and<br>
a p-th symbol demapper. The value of "r" can be decided by the number of RF<br>
channels, and the value of "p"can be decided by the number of streams transmitting<br>
PLP service data generated from the frame parser 243.<br>
[131] Therefore, if p number of services are transmitted to p number of PLP streams over R<br>
number of RF channels, the frame parser includes the r number of frequency de-<br>
interleavers, the p number of time de-interleavers, and the p number of symbol<br>
demappers.<br>
[132] In association with a first RF channel, the first frequency interleaver 241a performs<br>
de-interleaving of frequency-domain input data, and outputs the de-interleaving result<br>
[133] The frame parser 243 parses the TFS signal frame transmitted to several RF channels<br>
using scheduling information of the TFS signal frame, and parses PLP service data<br>
contained in the slot of a specific RF channel including a desired service. The frame<br>
parser 243 parses the TFS signal frame to receive specific service data distributed to<br>
several RF channels according to the TFS signal frame structure, and outputs first-path<br>
PLP service data.<br>
[134] The first time de-interleaver 245a performs de-interleaving of the parsed first-path<br>
PLP service data in the time domain. The first symbol demapper 247a determines<br>
service data mapped to the symbol to be bit data, such that it can output a PLP stream<br>
associated with the first-path PLP service data.<br>
[135] Provided that symbol data is converted into bit data, and each symbol data includes<br>
symbols based on the hybrid symbol-mapping scheme, the p number of symbol<br>
demappers, each of which includes the first symbol demapper, can determine the<br>
symbol data to be bit data using different symbol-demapping schemes in individual<br>
intervals of the input symbol data.<br>
[136] FIG. 16 is a block diagram illustrating a decoding demodulator according to the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 16, the decoding demodulator may include several<br>
function blocks corresponding to the coding and modulation unit. In this embodiment,<br>
the decoding demodulator of FIG. 16 may include a first de-interleaver 251, afirst<br>
decoder 253, a second de-interleaver255, and a second decoder 257. The second de-<br>
interleaver 255 can be selectively contained in the decoding demodulator.<br>
[137] The first de-interleaver 251 acts as an inner de-interleaver, and is able to perform de-<br>
interleaving of the p-th PLP stream generated from the frame parser.<br>
[138] The first decoder 253 acts as an inner decoder, can perform error correction of the<br>
de-interleaved data, and can use an error correction decoding algorithm based on the<br>
LDPC scheme.<br>
[139] The second de-interleaver 255 acts as an outer interleave^ and can perform de-<br>
interleaving of the error- correction-decoded data.<br>
[140] The second decoder 257 acts as an outer decoder. Data de-interleaved by the second<br>
de-interleaver 255 or error-corrected by the first decoder 253 is error-corrected again,<br>
such that the second decoder 257 outputs the re- error-corrected data. The second<br>
decoder 257 decodes data using the error correction decoding algorithm based on the<br>
BCH scheme, such that it outputs the decoded data.<br>
[141 ] The first de-interleaver 251 and the second de-interleaver 255 are able to convert the<br>
burst error generated in data contained in the PLP stream into a random error. The first<br>
decoder 253 and the second decoder 257 can correct errors contained in data.<br>
[142] The decoding demodulator shows operation processes associated with a single PLP<br>
stream. If the p number of streams exist, the p number of decoding demodulators are<br>
needed, or the decoding demodulator may repeatedly decode input data p times.<br>
[143] FIG. 17 is a block diagram illustrating an output processor according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 17, the output processor may include p number of<br>
baseband (BB) frame parsers (251a,..., 261p), a first service merger 263a, a second<br>
service merger 263b, a first demultiplexer 265a, and a second demultiplexer 265b.<br>
[144] The BB frame parsers (261a,..., 261p) remove BB frame headers from the first to p-<br>
th PLP streams according to the received PLP paths, and output the removed result.<br>
This embodiment shows that service data is transmitted to at least two streams. A first<br>
stream is an MPEG-2 TS stream, and a second stream is a GS stream.<br>
[145] The first service merger 263a calculates the sum of service data contained in payload<br>
of at least one BB frame, such mat it outputs the sum of service data as a single service<br>
stream. The first demultiplexer 255a may demultiplex the service stream, and output<br>
the demultiplexed result.<br>
[146] In this way, the second service merger 263b calculates the sum of service data<br>
contained in payload of at least one BB frame, such that it can output another service<br>
stream. The second demultiplexer 255b may demultiplex the GS-format service<br>
stream, and output the demultiplexed service stream.<br>
[147] FIG. 18 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for transmitting a signal<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 18, the<br>
signal transmission apparatus includes a service composer 310, a frequency splitter<br>
320, and a transmitter 400. The transmitter 400 encodes or modulates a signal<br>
including a service stream to be transmitted to each RF band.<br>
[148] The service composer 310 receives several service streams, multiplexes several<br>
service streams to be transmitted to individual RF channels, and outputs the mul-<br>
tiplexed service streams. The service composer 310 outputs scheduling information,<br>
such that it controls the transmitter 400 using the scheduling information. By this<br>
scheduling information, the service composer 310 modulates several serviceframes to<br>
be transmitted to several RF channels by the transmitter 400, and transmits the<br>
modulated service frames.<br>
[149] The frequency splitter 320 receives a service stream to be transmitted to each RF<br>
band, and splits each service stream into several sub-streams, such that the individual<br>
RF frequency bands can be allocated to the sub-streams.<br>
[150] The transmitter 400 processes the service streams to be transmitted to individual fre-<br>
quencybands, and outputs the processed resultant streams. For example, in association<br>
with a specific service stream to be transmitted to the first RF channel, the first mapper<br>
410 maps the input service stream data into symbols. The first interleaver 420 in-<br>
terleaves the mapped symbols to prevent the burst error.<br>
[151] The first symbol inserter 430 can insert a signal frame equipped with a pilot signal<br>
(e.g., a scatter pilot signal or a continual pilot signal) into the modulated signal.<br>
[152] The first modulator 440 modulates the data interleaved by the signal modulation<br>
scheme. For example, the first modulator 440 can modulate signals using the OFDM<br>
scheme.<br>
[153] The first pilot symbol inserter 450 inserts the first pilot signal and the second pilot<br>
signal in the signal frame, and is able to transmit the TFS signal frame.<br>
[154] Service stream data transmitted to the second RF channel is transmitted to the TFS<br>
signal frame via several blocks 415, 425, 435, 445, and 455 of different paths shown in<br>
the transmitter of FIG. 18.<br>
[155] The number of signal processing paths transmitted from the transmitter 400 may be<br>
equal to the number of RF channels contained in the TFS signal frame.<br>
[156] FIG. 19 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for receiving a signal according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 19, the signal<br>
reception apparatus may include a reception unit 510, a synchronization unit 520, a<br>
mode detector 530, an equalizer 540, a parameter detector 550, a de-interleaver 560, a<br>
demapper 570, and a service decoder 580.<br>
[157] The reception unit 500 is able to receive signals of a first RF channel selected by a<br>
user from among the signal frame. If the signal frame includes several RF channels, the<br>
reception unit 500 performs hopping of the several RF channels, and at the same time<br>
can receive a signal including the selected service frame.<br>
[158] The synchronization unit 510 acquires synchronization of a reception signal, and<br>
outputs the synchronized reception signal. The demodulator 520 is able to demodulate<br>
the synchronization-acquired signal. The mode detector 530 can acquire a FFT mode<br>
(e.g., 2k, 4k, 8k FFT operation length) of the second pilot signal using the first pilot<br>
signal of the signal frame.<br>
[159] The demodulator 520 demodulates the reception signal under the FFT mode of the<br>
second pilot signal. The equalizer 540 performs channel estimation of the reception<br>
signal, and outputs the channel-estimation resultant signal. The de-interleaver560 de-<br>
interleaves the channel-equalized reception signal. The demapper 570 demaps the in-<br>
terleaved symbol using the symbol demapping scheme corresponding to the<br>
transmission-signal symbol mapping scheme (e.g., QAM).<br>
[160] The parameter detector 550 acquires physical parameter information (e.g., Layer-1<br>
(LI) information) contained in the second pilot signal from the output signal of the<br>
equalizer 540, and transmits the acquired physical parameter information (for example,<br>
the network information of the NIT) to the reception unit 500 and the synchronization<br>
unit 510. The reception unit 500 is able to change the RF channel to another channel<br>
using network information detected by the parameter detector 550.<br>
[161] The parameter detector 550 outputs service-associated information (for example, the<br>
service description information of the SDT), service decider 580 decodes service data<br>
of the reception signal according to the service-associated information from the<br>
parameter detector 550, and outputs the decoded service data.<br>
[162] Next, specific information capable of describing broadcast signals while the signal<br>
frame of FIG. 1 or 3 is transmitted/received will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
Under the condition that the above-mentioned signal frame is transmitted/received, if<br>
the specific information describes the broadcast signals, is transmitted on the basis of a<br>
section, and is configured in the form of a single table, the above-mentioned specific<br>
information is called service table information. For example, PSI/SI information may<br>
be used as the above service table information.<br>
[163] The exemplary signal frame is designed to enable several RF channel groups to<br>
transmit several services. Network Information Table (NIT) capable of describing<br>
network information such as a physical channel may be contained in each RF channel,<br>
and may be then transmitted and received. For example, the NTT contained in a first<br>
RF channel (RF channel 1) describes channel information of four RF channels (RF<br>
channels 1-4) constructing the signal frame. The signal reception apparatus can<br>
acquire information associated with three services (Services 1-3) from the service<br>
table information.<br>
[164] If the signal reception apparatus tunes the first RF channel (RF channel 1) from<br>
among the signal frame, the first pilot signal P1 and the second pilot signal P2 can<br>
acquire corresponding information without performing the descrambling or de-<br>
interleaving. The NIT may be contained in the first signaling signal L1, such that the<br>
resultant NIT contained in the first signaling signal L1 is transmitted. In this case, the<br>
NIT may include network-associated information or TS (Transport Stream) in-<br>
formation constructing the network.<br>
[165] FIG. 20 shows a NIT contained into service table information according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[166] Referring to FIG. 20, the "table_id" field indicates an identifier capable of identifying<br>
the NIT. The "section_syntax_indicator" field may be set to the value of "1", and may<br>

" transport_stream_id"field indicates a TS (Transport Stream) identifier capable of dis-<br>
tinguishing a TS stream of a delivery system transmitting a current signal from another<br>
TS stream of another delivery system.<br>
[170] The "original_network_id" field is indicative of an identifier capable of identifying a<br>
network identifier of an original delivery system. A descriptor B which describes a cor-<br>
responding TS associated with a TS identifier, and a field indicating the length of the B<br>
descriptor are located after the "reserved_future_use" field.<br>
[171] Therefore, the NIT includes a descriptor describing all networks, and a TS (Transport<br>
Stream) loop describing transport streams of individual networks. Also, the NIT may<br>
include another descriptor describing a current transport stream (TS) from among<br>
transport streams.<br>
[172] FIG. 21 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for acquiring signal frame in-<br>
formation using the NTT according to the present invention. As described above, the<br>
NIT may be contained in the first signaling signal (L1), and a descriptor of the NIT<br>
may describe not only information of a corresponding RF channel but also information<br>
of another RF channel contained in the signal frame. The NTT may be contained in the<br>
first signaling signal L1. The NIT may include network-associated information of a<br>
signal transmitted by a current delivery system. The NIT may include specific in-<br>
formation capable of acquiring a desired service from the above signal frame in the<br>
above-mentioned descriptor A.<br>
[173] The descriptor A may include not only physical frequency information transmitting<br>
the above-mentioned signal frame, but also information associated with the signal<br>
frame. In the following description, the aforementioned descriptor A will hereinafter<br>
be referred to as "delivery_system_descriptor".<br>
[174] The "transportstream_loop" field of the delivery system descriptor may include a<br>
TS identifier for transmitting a service contained in the signal frame, and a descriptor<br>
B describing the TS identifier. This descriptor B is called a transport stream (TS) de-<br>
scriptor.<br>

the TFS signal frame transmitted by the delivery system. The "centre_frequency"field<br>
indicates a center frequency of the RF channel contained in the TFS signal frame.<br>
[179] If a super-frame is composed of a plurality of the above signal frames, the<br>
"num_of_frames_per_superframe" field indicates the number of signal frames<br>

transmitted. The "num_of_slots_per_frame" field may be variable according to table<br>
versions.<br>
[182] The "constellation" field indicates a constellation used for the symbol mapping. For<br>
example, 256QAM, 1024QAM, and hybrid symbol-mapping scheme information may<br>
be set to the "constellation" field. A detailed description of the "constellation" field will<br>
be described later.<br>

field can indicate each of the scatter pilot signals and the continual pilot signals.<br>
[185] The "RF_mode_indicator" field indicates whether the RF mode is used as a TF or FF<br>
(Fixed-Frequency) mode. In case of the TF mode, the "time_frequency_slicing"<br>
parameter is used. In case of the FF mode, the "time_frequency_slicing" parameter is<br>
not in use.<br>
[186] The "P2_error_correnction_mode" field indicates an error correction mode used for<br>
the exemplary signal frame. For example, in the case of using the LDPC error<br>
correction algorithm, the short mode and the long mode may be established in the<br>
"P2_error_correnction_mode" field. A detailed description thereof will hereinafter be<br>
described.<br>
[187] In association with the first signaling signal L1 equipped with RF-channel con-<br>
struction information and the second signaling signal L2 equipped with service con-<br>
struction information, the "P2_symbol_number" field indicates the size of the second<br>
signaling signal L2, i.e., the number of symbols contained in the second signaling<br>
signal L2.If a table version is changed to another, the value of the<br>
"P2_symbol_number" field may also be changed to another value. Next, information<br>
associated with the "P2_symbol_number" field will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
[188] The second signaling signal may include a Service Description Table (SDT) de-<br>
scribing the service. The SDT is able to describe the service contained in a single TS.<br>
For example, another service contained in another RF channel which is not contained<br>
in the above-mentioned signal frame may also be described in the SDT.<br>
[189] FIG. 23 shows the SDT according to the present invention. The SDT contained in the<br>

scriptor. The "descriptor_length" field indicates a length of the TS descriptor.<br>
[206] The transport stream (TS) can be transmitted to slots contained in a predetermined<br>

[209] FIG. 29 shows values of the "MIMO_indicator" field according to the present<br>
invention. Transmission structure information of a signal transmitted to a multi-path<br>

the "MIMCLindicator" value is set to "01", the value of "01" indicates the 2x2 (i.e., the<br>
number of transmission paths x the number of reception paths) MIMO scheme. If the<br>
"MIMCLindicator" value is set to "10", the value of "01" indicates the 4x4 (i.e., the<br>
number of transmission paths x the number of reception paths) MIMO scheme.<br>
[210] FIG. 30 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for receiving a signal according<br>
to yet another embodiment of the present invention. In more detail, FIG. 30 illustrates<br>
the signal reception apparatus capable of receiving the above-mentioned signal frame<br>
using the above service table information. Referring to FIG. 30, the signal reception<br>
apparatus includes a tuner 610, a demodulator 620, a demultiplexer 630, a service-<br>
information buffer 635, a stream buffer 637, a service-information decoder 640, a<br>
service-information storage unit 650, a manager 660, an interface unit 665, a data<br>
processor 670, a decoder 680, and a post-processor 690.<br>
[211] The tuner 610 receives the above-mentioned signal frame, and is able to tune the RF<br>
channel contained in the received signal frame. The tuner 610 performs hopping of RF<br>
channels contained in the signal frame to receive the PLP stream, and at the same time<br>
can receive signals contained in the RF channel.<br>
[212] The demodulator 620 can identify the TFS signal frame using the first signaling<br>
signal L1 contained in the signal frame. The demodulator 620 can acquire RF-channel<br>
information contained in the signal frame using the network information contained in<br>
the first signaling signal.<br>
[213] The network information contained in the first signaling signal L1 may include a<br>
variety of information, for example, the number of RF channels contained in the signal<br>
frame, the number of TFS signal frames contained in the super-frame, the frame<br>
duration, a constellation used for the symbol mapping, a guard interval, a pilot pattern,<br>
an error correction mode, etc.<br>
[214] The demodulator 620 can acquire the service description information from the<br>
second signaling signal L2. The service description information includes service<br>
location information from among a corresponding RF channel.<br>
[215] If the demodulator 620 demodulates the signal frame, the PLP stream contained in<br>
several RF channels may be outputted.<br>
[216] The demulitplexer 630 demultiplexes the service table information contained in the<br>
PLP stream and the service data stream. The service table information is stored in the<br>
service-information buffer 635, and the service data stream is stored in the stream<br>
buffer 637.<br>
[217] The interface unit 660 receives a control signal from a user, and outputs the received<br>
control signal to the manager 660 and the post-processor 690.<br>
[218] The manager 660 receives user-selected channel information and user-selected<br>
service information from the interface unit 665, and is able to control the above-<br>
mentioned function blocks to carry out the received information.<br>
[219] The manager 660 may include a channel manager for channel selection and a service<br>
manager for controlling services provided from the channel. If the service is selected,<br>
the channel manager can control the tuner 610 and the demodulator 620 to perform<br>
hopping of the channel equipped with a corresponding service stream. The channel<br>
manager is able to use network- and service- information decoded by the service-<br>
information decoder 640 to select a channel and a service.<br>
[220] The service manager controls A/V data contained in the service stream to be<br>
outputted, such that it can provide the service, and performs the application such that<br>
data contained in the service stream is outputted.<br>
[221] The service-information decoder 640 decodes the service table information stored in<br>
the service information buffer 635, and stores service information contained in the<br>
service table information in the service-information storage unit 650. If the service<br>
table informationis contained in the first and second signaling signals from among the<br>
signal frame demodulated by the demodulator 620, the service-information decoder<br>
640 receives and decodes the resultant service table information. For example, the<br>
service-information decoder 640 receives the service table information describing the<br>
network information from the first signaling signal. The service-information decoder<br>
640 receives the service table information describing the service from the second<br>
signaling signal, and decodes the received service table information.<br>
[222] The data processor 670 de-packetizes the stream data packet stored in the stream<br>
buffer 637. The packet filter 671 contained in the data processor 670 filters packet<br>
having a desired packet identifier from among the stream data packet stored in the<br>
stream buffer 637, such that only the corresponding packet can be transmitted to the<br>
decoder 680. If the corresponding packet acts as a packet for transmitting data, the data<br>
handler 673 of the data processor 670 extracts data to be provided as the service, and<br>
the middleware engine 675 can transmit the output data of the data handler 673 to the<br>
application implementing the data broadcasting.<br>
[223] The post-processor 690 outputs OSD (On Screen Display) on which the user selects a<br>
control signal received from the interface unit 665. Then, the post-processor 690<br>
performs post-processing of the output signal to output the audio/video/data<br>
broadcasting.<br>
[224] FIG. 31 is a flow chart illustrating a method for receiving a signal according to the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 21, the signal reception apparatus selects any one<br>
of RF channels transmitting a desired service to acquire the service contained in the<br>
above signal frame at step S110.<br>
[225] The signal reception apparatus receives the first signaling signal of the selected RF<br>
channel at step SI20, acquires specific information for describing network information<br>
from the first signaling signal, and acquires RF-channel information from the network<br>
information at step SI30. In this case, the specific information describing the network<br>
information may be contained in the first service table information, and may be then<br>
transmitted.<br>
[226] The signal reception apparatus receives the second signaling signal of the selected<br>
RF channel from among the signal frame at step S140. The signal reception apparatus<br>
acquires the service description information, and also acquires service construction<br>
format information contained in the signal frame via the above service description in-<br>
formation at step S150. The service description information may be contained in the<br>
second service table information, and may be then transmitted.<br>
[227] The above-mentioned apparatus decodes slots, each of which includes service data,<br>
from among the signal frame at step S160. The apparatus selects the transport stream<br>
(TS) using the TS information acquired from the network description information at<br>
step S170, and selects another TS stream including the service from the service de-<br>
scription information at step S180.<br>
[228] The apparatus acquires a desired service from the selected TS stream at step S190.<br>
According to the method and apparatus for transmitting/receiving a signal according to<br>
the present invention, a transmissionsignal can be easily detected and recovered, and a<br>
signal transmission/reception performance of an overall transmission/reception system<br>
can be improved.<br>
[229] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations<br>
can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and<br>
variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended<br>
claims and their equivalents.<br>

The present invention relates to a method for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing system. The method<br>
comprises receiving broadcasting signals according to Time Frequency Slicing frame multiplexed with at least one input stream in<br>
the time and frequency domain; performing deinterleaving of the received broadcasting signals in the frequency domain; parsing the<br>
frequency-deinterleaved broadcasting signals outputting a predetermined input stream among the frequency-deinterleaved broadcasting<br>
signals based on the parsed result; demapping symbols corresponding to the outputpredetermined input stream to bit data;<br>
and performing a first error correction decoding of the demapped bit data based on the low density parity bit scheme. The invention<br>
also relates to a corresponding apparatus for carrying out the method.</td>
