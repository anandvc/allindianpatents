INTRODUCTION<br>
The invention disclosed in this application relates to an importing nulation containing aspirin. The formulation is useful for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and decrease in recurrence of a heart attack and other heart related problems. The formulation does not react with gastric juices thereby enhancing its pharmaceutical efficacy. The formulation may be in the form of tablets &amp; capsules. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of above said formulation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aspirin or acetyl salicylic acid is a well-known therapeutic agent, which has been employed for many years as an analgesic as well as for its antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also well known that aspirin is an acidic drug which can cause gastric distress. Such gastric distress is caused primarily because the aspirin particles do not dissolve and such particles attach to the walls of the stomach. Equally well known today is the significant role which aspirin plays in the successful treatment and management of two of the most common major diseases that afflict the world's population, i.e. arthritis and heart attacks. According to the PDR (Physicians Desk Reference) Asprin also temporarily relieves the minor aches and pains of arthritis, muscle aches, colds, flu and menstrual discomfort. In some patients, a small daily dose of aspirin may be used to ensure sufficient blood flow to the brain and prevent stroke. Aspirin may also be taken to decrease recurrence of a heart attack or other heart problems.<br>
In addition, the beneficial effect of aspirin on the human immune system may make it a promising drug for possible use in the treatment of cancer, AIDS, cataracts, allergies and a number of other diseases in which the immune system is involved These valuable pharmacological properties have made aspirin the most widely used drug in the world. "It is also being studied for cancer prevention'* as per the National Cancer Institutes Cancer GOV Dictionary. As per AIDS treatment news no. 109- dated August 17,1990, Laboratory studies have suggested that reducing certain inflammatory reactions as aspirin does, may affect the pathogenesis of the disease, improving some immune functions, and possibly showing the<br><br>
replication of HIV by reducing the levels of certain chemical messengers which may trigger the growth of the Virus.<br>
Nevertheless, it has been documented that aspirin does possess a number of undesirable side effects, although the true severity of these side effects has not been recognized until recently. For example, being a sparingly soluble substance (only 0.33 gm in 100 ml of water), the undissolved particles of aspirin will normally adhere to the gastrointestinal mucosa Such adherence can cause lesions, gastric and duodenal ulcers and bleeding. These undesirable side effects are usually persistent and cumulative and they occur in a number of patients in which aspirin is used as a ther^y.<br>
To meet the above situation and to make good use of the activity of aspirin, delayed release aspirin pellets have been developed to reduce gastric irritation by not releasing the drug in the stomach and releasing the drug in intestine.<br>
The corrosive effects that aspirin may display on the gastrointestinal mucosa were recognized early in the history of aspirin therapy. Consequently, attempts to produce a soluble form of this drug have been made almost continuously since then. As far as in 1903, Prior art U.S. Pat. No. 740,703 reveals efforts were made to develop the drug, exclusively on the preparation of various soluble salts, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium as well as with organic amines and amino acids (lysine and ornithine). The main disadvantages of these particular salt products were that, in contrast to the aspirin itself, they were not stable.<br>
In order to make aspirin more useful as an oral dosage form for its use as preventive agent in Cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and decrease in recurrence of a heart attack and other heart problems, it is necessary to protect it against gastric juices v^ich are acidic in nature. Such a protection will enable the formulation to release aspirin in the intestine. To prevent contact of aspirin with gastric juices, the formulation is to be enteric coated.<br>
In US patent No: 4,775,536 an enteric coated aspirin tablet and process for making is described, in v^ich the core of the tablet is coated with enteric coating layer of film forming polymers and an over coat layer of non enteric film forming polymers. The drawback of<br><br>
aqueous enteric coating of aspirin tablet may lead to the hydrolysis/cleavage of parent molecule increasing the free salicylic acid content during storage period.<br>
In US Patent No: 5,576,024 a buffered aspirin tablet composed of aqueous based polymer coated aspirin, a buffering system and a hydrophilic gel forming matrix material was described, in vAdch the buffering system and matrix material, provide a microenvironment of pH 5.0 thus increasing the solubility of the aspirin. Though the solublity may show improvement, the formulation can still cause gastric irritation.<br>
The US Patent No: 5,582,837 alkyl -substituted cellulose based sustained release oral dosage forms are described. Sustained release oral dosage form comprise a tablet or capsule containing a plurality of particles of solid state dispersed in alkyl cellulose such as hydroxyethylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose. The tablet / c^sule upon ingestion disintegrates to disperse the particles into stomach vAievQ they imbibe water to cause them swell thus enhancing their retention in stomach. Imbibed water dissolves the drug entrj^ped in the particles and the resulting solution diffuses from the dispersed particles, assuring no solid drug contacts the mucosal tissue.<br>
The US Patent No: 5,603,957 relates to a controlled release microtablets &amp; capsules of acetyl salicylic acid coated with mixture of cellulose film formers, thus controlling release of acetyl salicylic acid throughout the length of gastrointestinal tract.<br>
JPO 2001-139469 dated 22/05/01, a novel sustained release preparation composition consists of Aspirin with coating material, which would be used in cardiovascular diseases, primarily a process of mixing sustained release particles, excipient and homogenizing them, used for oral adminstration.<br>
In all the above four patents the drug is released over a period of time , the drug in low doses may not provide immediate relief<br>
In US patent No: 5,683,721 a galenic preparation of therapeutic composition containing aspirin as sublingual administration was described, in which the active ingredient is in micro<br><br>
administration of aspirin may cause unpleasant taste and further keeping the large size dosage form beneath the tongue may cause discomfort to the consxmier.<br>
In US Patent No: 5,723,453 a stabilized , sodium free, alkaline and aspirin combination compound is described, in v^ch the compoimd is readily soluble in a preselected fluid i.e.water and produces potassium acetyl salicylate. This combination compound contains aspirin (USP 60 # mesh) within a range 325 -1000 mg per unit dose and alkaline compound between 250 -3000 mg per unit dose, having a pH generally within a range of between about 8.0 and about 10.0 and being present in a molar amount which is greater than a molar amount required to neutralize aspirin granules. As the tablet is effervescent and has to be dissolved in a large amount of water before administration, some users may find inconvenience and hence non- acceptable.<br>
In J^anese Publication Nbr 09-263538- 07/10/97 it is provided a stable pharmaceutical composition based on acetylsalicylic acid and tochoperol, for peroral administration, in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular and cancer ther^y. The pharmaceutical composition is based on capsule and is prepared by mixing with usually used additive used as excepients. The product appears to be a powder c^sule, which can cause gastric irritation.<br>
In our continued efforts to provide valuable and effective drug for effective prevention of cardiovascular disease such as stroke and decrease in recurrence of a heart attack and other heart problems, we directed our research towards developing dosage form aspirin which will have no effect by the gastric juices<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a delayed release oral dosage form of aspirin which prevents gastric irritation in individuals taking it as well as a process for preparing such forms of aspirin<br>
Delayed release composition resists the action of the acidic stomach fluids on the drug. The coating can protect the gastric mucosa from the irritating effects of aspirin. However this coating dissolves in the neutral or alkaline milieu of the intestine and active ingredients become available for absorption into blood stream.<br><br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved stable formulation containing aspirin useful for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and decrease in recurrence of a heart attack and other heart problems, v^toch will be resistant to gastric juices<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved stable formulation containing aspirin useful for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and decrease in recurrence of a heart attack and other heart problems, \\4iich delays release of aspirin in the stomach and facilitate immediate release in intestine for speedy absorption as against delayed release in the prior art.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the preparation of an improved and stabilized formulation containing aspirin useful for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and decrease in recurrence of a heart attack and other heart problems, which will be resistant to gastric juices and will dissolve in neutral to alkaline media and has good stability.<br>
We have developed this invention based on our finding that if the core containing aspirin is effectively protected its stability as well as its resistance to the action of gastric juices can be enhanced.<br>

Enteric coated pellets may be filled into hard gelatin c^sules or compressed into tablets in a conventional maimer and may be packed into a moisture resistant primary pack. For the long term stability of formulation, water content of the pellets in formulation is kept below 2.0%<br>
It would be observed that the active ingredient was available by using a buffered environment by enc^sulating the inert core surrounded by drug layer followed by intermediate layer and covered by enteric layer, that makes the drug stable over the entire shelf life of the product to enable it to pass from acidic layer in stomach to the alkali/neutral layer in the intestine. By doing so. Not only the stabilization of the drug is achieved but it also improve the solubility of drug, which facilitate the maximxjm bioavailability after the administration of dosage form.<br>
Another advantage of preparing the dosage form in the form of pellets is that there are less chances of degradation of the product, as it is an individual discrete particle unlike the tablets..<br>
The pellets are enc^sulated or compressed into tablets with a low moisture content vviiich avoids the degradation of aspirin due to moisture. The incorporation of preservatives in the<br><br>
formulation makes the product free of any additional microbial burden throughout its shelf life.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the Examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. It should be noted that in all the Examples the pellets formed according to the invention can be enc^sulated by any conventional method.<br>
