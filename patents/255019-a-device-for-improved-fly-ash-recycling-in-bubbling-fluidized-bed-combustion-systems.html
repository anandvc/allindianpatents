				<td>Title:  Fly ash recycling systems for fluidized bed System<br>
Field of Invention.<br>
This invention relates to Atmospheric fluidized Combustion systems using the<br>
conventional bubbling Fluidized Beds. The invention more particularly relates to a<br>
device for improved fly ash recycling in bubbling fluidized bed combustion systems.<br>
Background of the art:<br>
Atmospheric fluidized bed combustion ( AFBC) boilers and systems are being adopted<br>
extensively for coal, lignite, washery rejects and other waste fuels. In this system, the<br>
fuel is fed to a fluidized bed or inert/ ash particles maintained at 550 to 1200° C. Due to<br>
the fluid like property of the bed, the fuel particle is instantaneously heated by the inert<br>
particles and the fuel burns in the presence of oxygen available in the air being used for<br>
fluidizing the bed particles. A part of the ash which is coarser in size having unburnt<br>
carbon of about 1% is removed via overflow/bottom drains. Rest of the ash which is<br>
generally of finer size along with the unburnt particles ( the proportion of un-burnt is<br>
usually higher than that in the bottom ash and is a function of many variables like the<br>
coal size distribution, attrition characteristics of the coal ash, fluidizing velocity) is<br>
elutriated with the flue gas. The carbon conversion/combustion efficiency obtained in<br>
this system is low compared to the Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion ( CFBC)<br>
Systems in which the fly ash is separated in high efficiency cyclones and recycled back<br>
into the combustor, thus giving the carbon particles several cycles for completing the<br>
combustion. While the ABFBC boilers and systems are adopted for smaller sizes,<br>
CFBCs are preferred for larger capacity because of higher combustion efficiency even<br>
though CFBCs investment costs are higher . This invention facilitates increase in carbon<br>
conversion efficiency in atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed boiler( ATBC) thereby<br>
optimizing the overall economic competitiveness at least in a specific capacity range of<br>
systems, apart form increasing the boiler turn down capability.<br><br>
Fly ash recycling is adopted only in select ABFBC boilers and systems. In order to<br>
improve the carbon burn up, the fly ash which has some unburnt carbon particles are<br>
collected in a mechanical device and re-injected back into the bed by methods like<br>
gravity flow or pneumatic transport. Unlike the CFBC, the quantum collected and<br>
recycled is usually only a limited portion due to the problems associated with high-scale<br>
re-injecting. Since the fly ash collection is done after economizer, the temperature of ash<br>
would be of the order of 350° C only. This low temperature ash would naturally absorb<br>
heat from the furnace, which will ultimately result in reduced efficiency. While the<br>
gravity method warrants that the material is put back above the bed, thereby increasing he<br>
chances of the material getting carried away again by the flue gas without a chance for<br>
the unburnt carbon particles to reside/ remain long enough in the bed/ combustion<br>
system. Further pneumatic recycle system disturbs the bed and also puts a limitation on<br>
the quantity of ash that could be reinjected. In CFBC the furnace has a single fluid bed<br>
compartment. In ABFBC, depending on the boiler capacity there are multiple<br>
compartments and the fly ash is to be recycled to each compartment by each dedicated<br>
feed system. Even in CFBC boiler with increased boiler capacities, there is a need to opt<br>
an interlinked multiple feeding system.<br>
Objects of the invention.<br>
It is an object of the present inyention to provide a device for improved fly ash recycling<br>
in bubbling fluidized bed combustion system.	<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a device adaptable to bubbling fluidized<br>
bed combustion systems which can achieve improved burn-up of residual carbon in the<br>
fuel-burn.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a device which facilitates adaptation of<br>
the existing fluidized beds to feed maximum quantity of fuel-burn for recycling at an<br>
optimum temperature.<br><br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a device for selective fly ash recycling<br>
and /or disposal from any desired bed compartment in the event of segmental operation of<br>
the fluidized bed combustor.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a device for improved fly ash recycling<br>
having means to bypass recycling fly ash of one or more bed compartments in case of<br>
segmental operation of the fluidized bed combustor.<br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
Accordingly, there is a provided a device for repeated recycling at high temperature of<br>
fly ash having partly and /or fully unburnt carbon in operating compartments or segments<br>
of fluidized bed systems, the device comprising at least one fly ash dust collection means<br>
collecting a predetermined quantity of dust from the flue gas; at least one stand pipe<br>
sealingly coupled to the collection means for leading the collected material to a return<br>
leg , the atleast one return leg is angularly disposed in reference to the stand pipe such<br>
that the collected material finds a freeslide down by means of fluidizing air into at least<br>
one active fluidized bed compartment or a bed segment; a drain pipe connected to the<br>
stand pipe for disposal of the excess collection; and at least one gravity flow<br>
interconnection between each two bed segments for transferring ash in an event of<br>
slumping any or more bed segments .<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawing.<br>
Fig. 1. shows a schematic block diagram of elevational, plan and side sectional view of<br>
an embodiment of the present invention incorporated in an ABFBC system. ,<br>
Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment of the Invention.<br>
As shown in the Fig. 1, the novel recycling device consists of at least one ash separation<br>
means (1) which removes required proportion of the dust in the flue gas, a stand pipe (2)<br><br>
which leads the ash/ unburnt carbon to a return leg (3). The return leg (3) feeds the<br>
material into an active fluidized bed (4). Air is used as the fluidizing medium for the<br>
return leg (3) and optionally from the stand pipe (2). The angular disposition of the<br>
return leg (3) corresponds to achieve a free slide down of the material by means of the<br>
fluidizing air. The material of construction of the device components (1, 2, 3, 4) is<br>
selected to have a capability to withstand the temperature of the material (in which case<br>
it is insulated from outside to prevent heat loss and for safety). Alternatively, the selected<br>
materials should be capable of being cooled or refractory lined. The collection means<br>
may be the conventional cyclones (s) configured as a square/rectangular enclosure with<br>
suitable vortex finders or mechanical impingement type separator as required. During<br>
operation, the dust collection means (1) separates the ash/unburnt carbon particles and<br>
through the stand pipes (2) ( at least one per bed segment) feeds the return leg (3). The<br>
number of the collection means (1) may correspond the number of stand pipes (2), or<br>
could be increased in multiples of the number of stand pipes (2) for improved<br>
distribution.<br>
If, for operational and other requirements, one or more of the bed segments (4) are<br>
slumped, the ash through the corresponding stand pipe (2) is transferred to the adjoining<br>
return leg (3) through fluidized/gravity flow interconnection (5) and /or sent to disposal<br>
through drain pipes (6). During this time the fluidization air to a second compartment is<br>
cut off and thereby the ash recycling to the slumped bed is cut-off. This is in contrast to<br>
the existing practice of CFBC boilers in which there is no demarcation called "segments"<br>
and hence the need of by passing the return leg is not encountered. Due to the unique<br>
requirement of segmental operation in ABFBC boilers, there exists a need for return leg<br>
bypassing. This is achieved by the unique construction of the device as shown in the<br>
figure 1.<br><br>
