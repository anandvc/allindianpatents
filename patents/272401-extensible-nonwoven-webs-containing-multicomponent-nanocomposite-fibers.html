				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates to extensible nonwoven webs comprising multicomponent nanocomposite fibers and disposable articles comprising such nonwoven webs<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nonwoven webs formed by nonwoven extrusion processes such as, for example, meltblowing and spunbonding processes may be manufactured into products and components of products so inexpensively that the products could be viewed as disposable after only one or a few uses Exemplary products include disposable absorbent articles, such as diapers, incontinence briefs, training pants, feminine hygiene garments, wipes, and the like<br>
There is an existing consumer need for nonwovens that can deliver softness and extensibility when used in disposable products Softer nonwovens are gentler to the skin and help provide a more garment-like aesthetic for diapers Nonwovens that are capable of high extensibility can be used to provide sustained fit in products such as disposable diapers, for example, as part of a stretch composite, and facilitate the use of various mechanical post-treatments such as stretching, apertunng, etc Extensible matenals or structures are defined herein as those capable of elongating, but not necessarily recovering all or any of the applied strain Elastic matenals, on the other hand, by definition, must recover a substantial portion of their elongation after the load is removed<br>
There exists within the industry today a need for extensible nonwovens with moderate to low denier fibers that can be made from resins without the need for high cost specialty polymers or elastic polymers It is well known to those trained in the art that as spinning attenuation velocities increase, molecular onentation increases and fiber elongation decreases For strong, low denier fibers with low elongation, this is not a problem, but producing low denier fibers with high elongation remains a significant challenge It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide nonwoven webs compnsing low denier fibers that can be made from conventional resins without the need for costly additives It is a further object of the present invention to provide disposable articles compnsing such soft extensible nonwoven webs<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Extensible nonwoven webs compnsing multicomponent nanocomposite fibers are disclosed The multicomponent nanocomposite fibers comprise two or more components Each component of the multicomponent nanocomposite fibers comprises a polymer composition, and at least one component comprises a nanoparticles composition The weight of the nanoparticles composition relative to the weight of the multicomponent nanocomposite fiber is between about 01% and about 70% The nonwoven webs of the present invention may further compnse non-nanocomposite monocomponent or multicomponent fibers<br>
In one embodiment, the average elongation at peak load of the nonwoven web of the present invention may exceed about 80% in at least one direction In another embodiment, the nonwoven webs of the present invention may have an average elongation at peak load which is greater man the average elongation at peak load of comparable nonwoven webs without the multicomponent nanocomposite fibers In still another embodiment, the cross-direction (also called transverse direction, CD) elongation index of the nonwoven web of the present invention is at least about 1 5 relative to a comparable nonwoven web without the multicomponent nanocomposite fibers<br>
The nonwoven web of the present invention may have a basis weight of from about 5 to about 100 grams per square meter (g/m , gsm) and may be produced by a spunbonding process The diameter of the fibers compnsing the nonwoven web will typically be from about 5 to about 50 Âµm<br>
The polymer composition of any multicomponent nanocomposite fiber may contain a single polymer The single polymer may be polypropylene Alternatively, the polymer composition of any multicomponent nanocomposite fiber may comprise a blend of two or more polymers These polymers might be polypropylenes or polypropylene and one or more different polymers In one embodiment, the melt flow rate of the polymer composition is from about 10 to about 1000 grams per 10 minutes (g/10 mm)<br>
The present invention is also directed to the fibers used in the nonwoven webs The nonwoven webs of the present invention may be used to make disposable articles<br>

refers to a fiber having more than one component, 1 e, more than one separate part in spatial relationship to one another The term "multicomponent fiber" includes "bicomponent fiber", which is defined as a fiber having two separate parts in spatial relationship to one another The different components of a multicomponent fiber are arranged in substantially distinct regions across the cross-section of the fiber and extend continuously along the length of the fiber The multicomponent fibers may have various configurations, such as side-by-side, nbbon, sheath-core, segmented pie, islands-in-the-sea, or combinations thereof Examples of these configurations are described in U S Pat No 6,746,766 B2 issued to Bond et al<br>
As used herein, the term "absorbent article" refers to devices that absorb and contain body exudates, and, more specifically, refers to devices that are placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body<br>
As used herein, the term "disposable" is used to describe absorbent articles that are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as absorbent articles (1 e , they are intended to be discarded after a single use and, to be recycled, composted or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally compatible manner) A "unitary" absorbent article refers to an absorbent article that is formed of separate parts united together to form a coordinated entity so that it does not require separate manipulative parts like a separate holder and liner<br>
As used herein, the term "nonwoven web", refers to a web that has a structure of individual fibers or threads which are interlaid, but not in any regular, repeating manner Nonwoven webs have been, in the past, formed by a variety of processes, such as, for example, air laying processes, meltblowing processes, spunbonding processes and carding processes, including bonded carded web processes<br>
As used herein, the term "microfibers" refers to small diameter fibers having an average diameter not greater than about 100 Âµm, and a length-to-diameter ratio of greater than about 10 Those trained in the art will appreciate that the diameter of the fibers compnsing a nonwoven web impact its overall softness and comfort, and that the smaller denier fibers generally result in softer and more comfortable products than larger denier fibers For fibers of the present invention, it is preferable that the diameters are in the range of about 5 to 50 Âµm to achieve suitable softness and comfort, more preferable in the range from about 5 to 35 Âµm, and even more preferable in the range from about 15 to 30 Âµm The fiber diameter can be determined using, for example, an optical microscope calibrated with a 10 Âµm graticule<br>
As used herein, the term "meltblown fibers", refers to fibers formed by extruding a molten thermoplastic matenal through a plurality of fine, usually circular, die capillaries as molten threads or filaments into a high velocity gas (e g, air) stream which attenuates the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce their diameter to generally from 0 5 to 10 Âµm, but more typically in the range from 1 to 5 Âµm Thereafter, the meltblown fibers are earned by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface to form a web of randomly dispersed meltblown fibers<br>
As used herein, the term "spunlaid fibers" refers to small diameter fibers that are formed by extruding a molten thermoplastic matenal as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular, capillanes of a spinneret with the diameter of the extruded filaments then being rapidly reduced by drawing A spunlaid nonwoven web may be produced, for example, by the conventional spunlaid process wherein molten polymer is extruded into continuous filaments which are subsequently quenched, attenuated by a high velocity fluid, and collected in random arrangement on a collecting surface After filament collection, any thermal, chemical or mechanical bonding treatment, or any combination thereof (I e , "spunbonding" process), may be used to form a bonded web such that a coherent web structure results Thermal point bonding of a spunlaid nonwoven web produces a "spunbonded" nonwoven web<br>
In one embodiment, nonwoven webs in the present invention may contain only spunlaid fibers In another embodiment, the nonwoven webs may contain a mixture of spunlaid fibers and meltblown fibers either in discrete layers or mixtures In another embodiment, the nonwoven webs may contain multiple layers of spunlaid fibers and meltblown fibers that differ in concentrations of nanoparticles   These unbonded fibers are the consolidated together<br>
As used herein, the term "staple fibers" refers to small diameter fibers that are formed by extruding a molten thermoplastic matenal as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular, capillanes of a spinneret with the diameter of the extruded filaments then being rapidly reduced by drawing, typically using conventional godet winding systems The fiber diameter can be further reduced through post-extrusion drawing pnor to cutting the fibers into discontinuous lengths The fibers may also have finish applied or be enmped to aid in, for example, a carding process Staple fibers may be used, for example, to make nonwoven fabnes using carding, air-laid or wet-laid processes<br>
As used herein, the term "nanocomposite fiber" refers to a fiber compnsmg nanoparticles<br>
Multicomponent continuous, staple, hollow, shaped (such as multi-lobal) fibers can all be produced by using the methods of the present invention The fibers of the present invention may have different geometnes that include round, elliptical, star shaped, rectangular, and other various eccentricities As used herein, the diameter of a noncrrcular cross section fiber is the equivalent diameter of a circle having the same cross-sectional area<br>
As used herein, the term "extensible nonwoven" refers to any nonwoven, which upon application of an extending force, has an average CD elongation at peak load of at least about 80%, in one embodiment, at least about 100%, and in another embodiment, at least about 140% The average elongation at peak load described herein is determined according to the method outlined in the tensile testing methods section for nonwoven webs<br>
As used herein, the term "elongation index" refers to the average elongation at peak load for a nonwoven web containing nanocomposite fibers divided by the average elongation at peak load for a comparable nonwoven web without nanocomposite fibers "Comparable" refers to nonwoven webs which are produced with about the same throughput, have about the same basis weight, and their fibers have about the same diameter and comprise the same polymer composition but lack the nanoparticles composition In one embodiment, the elongation index is greater than 1, in another embodiment, it is greater than 1 2, and in yet another embodiment, it is greater than 1 5 In some cases, the elongation index is greater than 2<br>
As used herein, the terms "consolidation" and "consolidated" refer to the bnnging together of at least a portion of the fibers of a nonwoven web into closer proximity to form a site, or sites, which function to increase the resistance of the nonwoven to external forces, e g, abrasion and tensile forces, as compared to the unconsolidated web "Consolidated" can refer to an entire nonwoven web that has been processed such that at least a portion of the fibers are brought into closer proximity, such as by thermal point bonding Such a web can be considered a "consolidated web" In another sense, a specific, discrete region of fibers that is brought into close proximity, such as an individual thermal bond site, can be described as "consolidated" Consolidation can be achieved by methods that apply heat and/or pressure to the fibrous web, such as thermal spot (I e, point) bonding Thermal point bonding can be accomplished by passing the fibrous web through a pressure nip formed by two rolls, one of which is heated and contains a plurality of raised points on its surface, as is described in U S Pat No 3,855,046 issued to Hansen et al Consolidation methods can also include, but are not limited to, ultrasonic bonding,  through-air bonding,  resin bonding,  and hydroentanglement   Hydroentanglement<br>
typically involves treatment of the fibrous web with high pressure water jets to consolidate the web via mechanical fiber entanglement (friction) in the region desired to be consolidated, with the sites being formed in the area of fiber entanglement The fibers can be hydroentangled as taught in U S Pat No 4,021,284 issued to Kalwaites and U S Pat No 4,024,612 issued to Contrator et al<br>

Experimental Procedures Fiber Analysis<br>
Mounting of Fiber Samples For each sample tested, 10-12 fibers were prepared Fibers are randomly selected and separated from the bundle The fiber is then taped to a rectangular paper frame, being sure to wrap tape and the end of the fiber over the backside the frame Care is taken not to stretch or deform the fiber in any way<br>
Diameter Measurements Mounted fibers are viewed on a Zeiss Axioskope microscope equipped with a color video camera and a display monitor With the fiber in focus under a 40x objective lens and a lx eyepiece the diameter of the fiber is measured on the monitor in inches with a pair of calipers The microscope is calibrated for this magnification, using a 1 mm scale divided into lOOths, manufactured by Graticules LTD<br>
Tensile Testing Mounted samples are tensile tested on an MTS Synergie 400 material tester equipped with a calibrated 10N load cell and Testworks 4 software version 4 04 Fibers are tested according to ASTM D3822, with a test gauge length of 1 in and a crosshead speed of 2 in /mm Mounted fibers are loaded into tester gnps The paper frame is cut away on both sides of the fiber so paper does not interfere with test An average of ten fibers is tested, and the average elongation at break is used as the measure of extensibility<br>
Spunbonded Nonwoven Web Production and Tensile Testing<br>
Web Production Polyolefin compositions are converted into spunbonded nonwoven webs on a pilot scale spunbonded nonwoven line equipped with a slot jet attenuation system, a perforated moving belt under vacuum and a thermal calendar bonding system Webs are produced using a mass throughput of 0 4 grams per hole per minute (ghm), and the line speed is adjusted to achieve a basis weight of approximately 20 gsm, unless specified otherwise The bonding temperature is optimized for each sample, but was generally found to be about the same as the Comparative Example The bonding temperature is the actual surface temperature of the calender with one calender roll being "engraved" with a bond area of 18% and the other calender being a smooth roll The bonding pressure is kept constant at 350 pounds per linear inch, unless otherwise specified The bonding temperature is optimized to be the best combination of CD tensile strength and elongation at peak load In any case, the conditions chosen were for CD tensile strengths no less than 10% below the CD maximum<br>
Tensile Testing For each nonwoven web, one tensile test strip is prepared by first cutting a 1 in width strip in the direction of interest using a JDC Precision Sample Cutter (Thwing-Albert Instrument Company, Philadelphia, PA) The length of the sample strip is then trimmed to about 7 in Each sample stop is tensile tested on a testing machine, for example, on an Instron 1122 modified with a MTS Sintech ReNew Upgrade Package and equipped with a 50 lb load cell, 1 in width serrated grip faces, and Testworks Software Version 3 1, or on a MTS Synergie 400 test stand equipped with a 100 N load cell, 1 in width rubber grip faces, and Testworks Software Version 4 07 (Instron Corporation, Canton, Mass , MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Praire, MN) Sample strips are tested with a gauge length of 5 in and a crosshead speed of 5 in /min An average of ten nonwoven stnps is tested, and the average elongation at peak load is used as the measure of extensibility<br>
