23-7-20008<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
7 APR 2005<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to stable oil-in-water emulsion compositions for<br>
intravenous administration having preservative efficacy.   It particularly relates to<br>
5	stable   oil-in-water   emulsion   compositions   of   Propofol   for   intravenous<br>
administration, having preservative efficacy. Other embodiment of this invention<br>
relates to oil-in-water emulsion compositions having preservative efficacy of oils<br>
and fats for intravenous feeding. Another embodiment of this invention relates to<br>
oil-in-water emulsion compositions having preservative efficacy containing<br>
10	combination of lipophilic drugs and hydrophilic drugs.   Yet another embodiment<br>
of this invention relates to oil-in-water emulsion compositions having preservative efficacy comprising intravenous fat emulsion compositions and hydrophilic / lipophilic drugs.<br>
15	Compositions   for   intravenous   administration   need   to   satisfy   more<br>
stringent requirements of safety than those prepared for other mode of administration such as oral dosage forms, dosage forms for external use etc.<br>
Background and Prior Art 20<br>
A: Intravenous Propofol Emulsion Compositions:<br>
Propofol (i.e. 2,6-Diisopropylphenol) is a well-known and widely used<br>
intravenous anaesthetic agent. Propofol is a hydrophobic, water-insoluble oil. To<br>
25	overcome the solubility problem, it must be incorporated with solubilising agents,<br>
surfactants, and/or solvents.<br>
US-A-5637625  (issued   10th  June   1997;   corresponding  to  EP-A-<br>
07996616,   published   24th   September   1997)   discloses   formulations   of<br>
30	phospholipid-coated microdroplets of propofol devoid of fats and triglycerides<br>
providing chronic sedation over extended periods of time without fat overload.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Being  free  of nutrients that  support  bacterial  growth,  these  microdroplet formulations are bacteriostatic and bactericidal (e.g. self-sterilizing) and thus have extended   shelf  life.   The   following   paragraphs   from   the   US-A-5637625 specification are reproduced for clear understanding. 5<br>
	"The coating material of the propofol microdroplet can be chosen from<br>
the lipids described in my U.S. Pat. No. 4,725,442 (incorportated herein by reference) columns 5-7, particularly the phospholipids described in Class A, B and C. Additionally, the microdroplet can be coated by certain mono-glycerides<br>
10	capable of forming oriented monolayers and bilayers in the presence of decane<br>
(Benz et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 394:323-334, 1975). Examples of useful mono-glycerides include, but are not limited to, the following: 1-monopalmitoyl-(rac)-glycerol (Monopalmitin); l-monocaprylol-(rac)-glycerol (Monocaprylin); 1-monooleoyl-(rac)-glycerol    (C18:1,    cis-9)    (Monoolein); 1 -monostearyl-(rac)-<br>
15	glycerol (Monostearin)" <br>
	"The phospholipid-coated microdroplets at about 0.1 Âµm diameter<br>
droplet of drug in the oil state, coated with a stabilizing monolayer of phospholipid are described in my earlier patents U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,622,219 and<br>
20 4,725,442, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Microdroplet formulations have been made for many compounds including<br>
methoxyflurane, isoflurane and Vitamin E. The present invention provides a<br>
formulation of microdroplet propofol which allows the administration of propofol<br>
without the fat."	<br>
25<br>
The microdroplet composition described in this US patent does not contain any fat, and therefore does not support any microbial growth. Also, the injection becomes painful beyond tolerance.<br>
30	Propofol injections usually are made by diluting Propofol in oils and then<br>
formulated into    oil-in-water type of emulsions.     The compositions of the<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br><br>
Propofol incorporated into the oily phase and made into oil-in-water emulsions for intravenous administration are termed hereafter "intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions."<br>
5	Intravenous fat emulsions used for total parenteral nutrition are termed<br>
hereafter "intravenous fat emulsion compositions".<br>
A Propofol / soybean oil emulsion has gained widespread use for<br>
induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia, for maintenance of monitored<br>
10	anaesthesia care and for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).    It is<br>
advantageous in that it possesses both a rapid onset anaesthesia and a short<br>
recovery time.<br>
However, the presence of vegetable oils and phospholipids makes the<br>
15	emulsion highly prone to the risk of microbial growth due to adventitious<br>
extrinsic contamination especially during long term use in patients undergoing ICU sedation.<br>
Intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions are being increasingly used<br>
20	for   sedation   of seriously   ill   patients  particularly   in   ICUs  wherein  it   is<br>
continuously infused. There are noscomial (i.e. hospital acquired) infections<br>
observed very often in ICU patients. Microbial contamination of total<br>
intravenous nutritional emulsion formulation supplements administered through<br>
infusion sets is recognized as one of the main reasons of noscomial infection<br>
25	among   ICU   patients.      Hence   it   is   recommended   that   the   intravenous<br>
administration sets are changed frequently, at least every 6 or 12 hours. Continuous infusion makes the product susceptible to microbial growth.<br>
In order to reduce the risk of uncontrolled microbial growth, additions of<br>
30	various potential preservatives into intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions<br>
have been tried.   Some of the potential agents found to cause instability of the<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
emulsion. Other potential agents failed to provide the level of antimicrobial<br>
activity being sought. It is necessary to preserve the compositions with<br>
preservatives that would provide the required levels of antimicrobial activity at as<br>
low a concentration as possible in order to minimise the potential for physical<br>
5	instability and to minimise toxicity concerns.<br>
EP-A-0814787 (published 7th January 1998; corresponding to US-A-5714520, issued 3rd February 1998) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing an edetate as an antimicrobial agent. The amount of edentate<br>
10	is preferably no more than 0.1% by weight but is sufficient to prevent a no more<br>
than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) Eschericha coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of<br>
15	said   composition   at   approximately   50  colony-forming  units  per  ml   at   a<br>
temperature in the range 20 - 25 Â°C, incubated in that temperature range and tested for viable counts of said organism after 24 hours. The currently marketed formulation comprises 1% w/v Propofol, 10% w/v Soybean Oil, 1.2% w/v Egg Phosphatides as an emulsifier, 2.25% w/v Glycerol and 0.0055% w/v disodium<br>
20	edetate, Sodium hydroxide and Water for Injection.<br>
Edetate has been shown to delay but not to prevent the onset of microbial<br>
growth in Propofol emulsions (see WO-A-00/24376, infra).   Propofol emulsion<br>
compositions are required to be diluted up to 5 times (1:4) for long-term infusion.<br>
25	On dilution the edetate concentration gets reduced to 0.0011%. Edetate is found<br>
to be ineffective in preventing a no more than 10 fold increase in broad spectrum microbial growth at concentrations of 0.0025% and below (see US-A-6028108; infra).<br>
30	Edetate acting as a preservative in this formulation is a metal ion chelator<br>
that removes essential trace elements like zinc.  This can be potentially dangerous<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
to patients who are administered Propofol for a prolonged duration as it will cause deficiency of zinc in certain individuals. Even the manufacturer of this product recommends supplemental zinc therapy to overcome the untoward effects.<br>
5	WO-A-99/39696 (published 12th August 1999; corresponding to US-A-<br>
6469069 issued 22nd October 2002) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing a sulphite as an antimicrobial agent. The amount of sulphite preferably is in the range 0.0075% to 0.66% by weight and is sufficient to prevent a no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus aureus<br>
10	(ATCC   6538)   Escherichia   coli   (ATCC   8739),   Pseudomonas   aeruginosa<br>
(ATCC9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition at approximately 50 colony-forming units per ml and incubated at a temperature in the range 30 - 35 Â°C and tested for viable<br>
15	counts of said organism after 24 hours.   The use of sulphite has two problems;<br>
viz. (a) stability of the emulsion is affected and (b) it is potentially toxic material at little higher dose level.<br>
Reference is made to the water-immiscible solvent of the oil-in-water<br>
20	emulsion being a mono-, di-, or triglyceride. The preferred amount of solvent is 5<br>
to 25 % by weight.<br>
Infusion of preferred compositions is accordance with WO-A-99/39696/US-A-6469069 at a rate of 50 Âµg/kg/min for 24 hours will result in<br>
25	sulphite concentrations approaching the toxic levels.   Further, the compositions<br>
may cause allergic reactions because of the sulphite molecule and the compositions have been reported to be physically and chemically unstable on exposure (see Han J et al International Journal of Pharmaceutics 2001, 215(1-2):207 - 220 &amp; Baker MT et al Anesthesiology 2002, 97(5): 1162 -1167).<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
US-A-6028108 (issued 22nd February 2000; corresponding to WO-A-<br>
00/23050, published 27th April 2000)    discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of<br>
Propofol containing a pentetate as an antimicrobial agent.    Preferably, the<br>
pentetate is present in an amount of  0.0005% to 0.1% by weight sufficient to<br>
5	prevent a no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus<br>
aureus (ATCC 6538) Eschericha coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours after adventitious extrinsic contamination.<br>
10	Pentetate, as used herein, refers to diethylene triamine pentaacetate or<br>
"DTPA", and derivatives thereof. Tn general suitable derivatives of DTPA are those salts having lower affinity for DTPA than calcium. Particular derivatives include but are not limited to calcium trisodium pentetate.<br>
15	Pentetate acting as a preservative in this formulation is a metal ion<br>
chelator that removes cations like calcium, magnesium and zinc. This can be potentially dangerous to patients who are administered Propofol for a prolonged duration.<br>
20	WO-A-00/24376 (published 4th May 2000; corresponding to US-A-<br>
6140373 &amp; US-A-6140374, both issued 31st October 2000) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing an antimicrobial agent selected from (a) benzyl alcohol alone or, preferably, together with either sodium edetate or sodium benzoate and (b) benzethonium chloride.   Preferably, the composition comprises<br>
25	Propofol 0.1 -5.0 % by wt.; vegetable oil, preferably soybean oil, 1- 30 % by wt;<br>
surfactant, preferably egg phosphatide, 0.2 to 2 % by wt.; glycerol 2 - 3 % by wt.; and antimicrobial agent selected from (i) benzyl alcohol 0.0175 - 0.9 % by wt., (ii) benzyl alcohol 0.07 - 0.9 % by wt and sodium edetate 0.005% by wt., (iii) benzethonium chloride 0.01% to 0.1% by wt. and, most preferably, (iv) benzyl<br>
30	alcohol 0.0175 - 0.9 % by wt. and sodium benzoate 0.07% by wt.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Reference is made to the water-immiscible solvent of the oil-in-water emulsion being an ester of a medium or long chain fatty acid, exemplified as a mono-, di-, or triglyceride.   The preferred amount of solvent is 10 to 20 % by weight. 5<br>
For long-term use, the antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and benzethonium chloride are not recommended as they are toxic.<br>
WO-A-00/56364 (published 28th September 2000; corresponding to US-<br>
10	A-6177477,    issued   23rd   January   2001)   discloses   sterile   pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for parenteral administration containing Propofol in an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion containing tromethamine (i.e. 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-l,3-<br>
propanediol) as an antimicrobial agent in an amount sufficient to prevent<br>
significant growth of microorganisms for at least 24 hours after adventitious<br>
15	extrinsic contamination.  Preferably, the tromethamine is present in an amount of<br>
0.15% to 0.25% by weight. The pH of the composition is highly alkaline and will degrade phospholipids and Propofol on long-term storage.<br>
Further, tromethamine is known to cause extravasation at the site of<br>
20	injection and may cause tissue damage and also is reported to cause respiratory<br>
depression.<br>
WO-A-00/59471 (published 12th October 2000; corresponding to US-A-6100302, issued 8th August 2000) discloses intravenous anaesthetic Propofol<br>
25	emulsions having decreased levels of soybean oil, fats or triglycerides.    The<br>
formulation preferably consists of phospholipid-coated microdroplets ranging from 160 to 200 nanometers in diameter. These microdroplets contain a sphere of Propofol dissolved in a solvent, such as vegetable oil, surrounded by a stabilizing layer of a phospholipid.   It is reported that this formulation can safely provide<br>
30	sedation over extended periods of time and that the low oil concentration<br>
emulsion  containing Propofol  provides  a  stable  oil-in-water  emulsion  and<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
unexpectedly exhibits antimicrobial properties comparable to higher water immiscible solvent concentration emulsions containing preservatives.<br>
Typically the emulsion comprises from 0.1 to 5%, by weight, preferably<br>
5	1% to 2% by weight, of Propofol.    The water-immiscible solvent, preferably<br>
soybean oil, is suitably present in an amount that is from 0.1 to 3% and more suitably from 1 to 3% by weight of the composition. However, the reduction in the oil content makes the injection more painful because of free Propofol in the aqueous phase.<br>
10<br>
WO-A-00/59475 (published 12th October 2000; corresponding to US-A-6383471' issued 7th May 2002) describes a pharmaceutical composition including a hydrophobic therapeutic agent having at least one ionizable functional group and a carrier.   The carrier includes an ionizing agent capable of ionizing the<br>
15	functional group,  a surfactant,  and optionally solubilisers,  triglycerides,  and<br>
neutralizing agents. It also describes a method of preparing such compositions by providing a composition of an ionizable hydrophobic therapeutic agent, an ionizing agent, and a surfactant, and neutralizing a portion of the ionizing agent with a neutralizing agent.   The compositions are particularly suitable for use in<br>
20	oral dosage forms and can be filled in capsules or made into a dosage form by<br>
coating on a particulate carrier. They also can be formulated as a solution, a cream, a lotion, an ointment, a suppository, a spray, an aerosol, a paste or a gel. Alternative dosage forms can be administered by routes selected from the group consisting of oral, parenteral, topical, transdermal, ocular, pulmonary, vaginal,<br>
25	rectal and transmucosal.<br>
Listed surfactants for use in the compositions include monoglycerides<br>
with specific reference to Monolaurin and listed therapeutic agents include<br>
Propofol but there is no exemplification of any monoglyceride-containing or<br>
30	Propofol-containing composition.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
It is believed that of the prior art compositions discussed above, only two products, one with edetate and another with metabisulphite are commercially available.    Thus a need exists to develop an intravenous Propofol emulsion composition with improved preservative efficacy. 5<br>
B: Intravenous Fat Emulsion Compositions:<br>
Intravenous fat emulsion compositions containing emulsified vegetable<br>
oils have been in clinical use for nearly forty years.    These were originally<br>
10	introduced to provide a source of calories for patients unable to ingest food. The<br>
total intravenous nutrition supplements are oil-in-water type emulsions. These intravenous oil feeding emulsion compositions are continuously improved with the advances in the nutritional requirements of the patients.<br>
15	JP-A-58-230918 (acknowledged in US-A-5874470 infra) describes an<br>
emulsion containing eicosapentaenoic acid for oral and non-oral use. Said emulsion contains from 1 to 40% w/v of eicosapentaenoic acid or, preferably, its methyl or ethyl ester; from 1 to 30% w/v of a vegetable oil, preferably soybean oil; from 0.01 to 30% w/v of alpha-tocopherol; and, as emulsifiers, from 0.1 to<br>
20	5% w/v of a phospholipid, preferably from egg yolk and/or soybean; and from 0.1<br>
to 10% w/v of a non-ionic synthetic emulsifier.<br>
DE-A-3409793 (published 20th September 1984; corresponding to US-A-5034414, issued 23rd July  1991) discloses a nutritional liquid emulsion for<br>
25	transfusion comprising at least one C20-22 fatty acid or ester thereof or a mixture<br>
thereof , a vegetable oil, an emulsifier and water.. It is reported to possess antithrombic and antiarteriosclerotic activity as well as being nutritionally valuable. Preferably, the composition comprises 5 to 20% w/v of the fatty acid(s) or ester(s), 1 to 19% w/v of a vegetable oil, 1 to 2% w/v of an emulsifier, and 1 to<br>
30	5 % w/v of an emulsion stabilizer.   The vegetable oil preferably is soybean oil<br>
and/or safflower oil, and the emulsifier preferably is egg yolk or soybean lecithin.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
EP-A-0145873   (published   26th   June   1985)   discloses  a  transfusion<br>
emulsion comprising fat, an emulsifier and water and intended as a nutritional<br>
supplement.  The fat phase consists of from 10 to 50% w/v of an alpha-linolenic<br>
acid ester, preferably the triglyceride or ethyl ester.  The balance of the fat can be<br>
5	a vegetable oil, preferably safflower oil or soybean oil<br>
EP-A-0311091 (published 12th April 1989; corresponding to US-A-5,874,470, issued 23rd February 1999) discloses isotonic fat emulsions incorporating   omega-3-fatty   acids,   omega-6-fatty  acids,   and  medium-chain<br>
10	triglycerides.    The emulsions are intended for parenteral application in post-<br>
aggression metabolism, in cases of chronic inflammatory diseases, and in neonatology and paediatrics and can provide a liver protective effect. Due to the combination of omega-3-fatty acids and/or their physiologically acceptable esters with medium-chain-triglycerides, the medium-chain triglycerides are preferred to<br>
15	be oxidized in the organism, and the omega-3 fatty acids are protected from rapid<br>
oxidation, so that they are available to a higher extent for the formation of triply unsaturated eicosanoids.. The emulsions have a total fat content of 5 to 30% and an emulsifier content of 5 to 12% of the fat content. The emulsifier preferably is a phospholipid, glycerol can be used as isotonic agent and the preferred pH of the<br>
20	emulsion is 6 - 9.<br>
There is no reference to the presence of antimicrobial agents; the only preservatives mentioned are antioxidants for the omega-3 fatty acid components.<br>
25	None of such total intravenous nutritional formulation supplements are<br>
protected from possible microbial growth arising from extraneous contamination and leading to infections. Thus there is a need to improve such products and overcome the disadvantages of the intravenous fat emulsion compositions and particularly commercially available marketed formulations.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Object of Invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a sterile, stable<br>

A;lntravenous Propofol Emulsion Compositions:<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there<br>
is  provided  a  sterile  pharmaceutical  oil-in-water  emulsion  composition  for<br>
30	intravenous administration comprising<br>
(i)       Propofol;<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
(ii)      one or more triglyceride oil - natural such as vegetable oils or synthetic such as MCT oil;<br>
(iii)     one or more naturally occurring phosphatides such as purified egg<br>
lecithin, soya lecithin;<br>

Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Staphylococcus aureus  ATCC<br>
      10	6538 for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed<br>
suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of said<br>
composition at approximately 50 colony forming units per ml and<br>
incubated at a temperature in the range of 20 - 25Â°C for culture of<br>
Candida albicans and at a temperature in the range of 30 - 35Â°C<br>
15	for the remaining cultures and are tested for viable counts of said<br>
organisms  after  24   hours  and  wherein  the  said  amount  of Monolaurin being no more than 1% w/v of the said composition.<br>
One preferred composition of this embodiment comprises<br>
20	Propofol about 1% w/v,<br>
Soybean oil about 10% w/v,<br>
Purified egg lecithin about 1.2% w/v,<br>
Glycerin about 2.25% w/v,<br>
Monolaurin about 0.05% w/v,<br>
25	Sodium hydroxide sufficient to bring the pH between 6 and 8.5 and<br>
Water for Injection to make up to 100% by volume.<br>
Another preferred composition of this embodiment comprises<br>
Propofol about 2% w/v,<br>
30     Soybean oil about 10% w/v, Purified egg lecithin about 1.2% w/v,<br><br>

Another preferred composition of this embodiment comprises<br>
Propofol about 1% w/v,<br>
Soybean oil about 10% w/v,<br>
Purified egg lecithin about 1.2% w/v,<br>
10	Glycerin about 2.25% w/v,<br>
Monolaurin about 0.01% w/v,<br>
Sodium hydroxide sufficient to bring the pH between 6 and 8.5 and<br>
Water for Injection to make up to 100% by volume.<br>
15	As  explained  above,  Propofol  emulsion compositions are  prone to<br>
microbial contamination and hence they need to be preserved with preservatives so that the product does not support the growth of microorganisms in case of adventitious extrinsic contamination. As all antimicrobial agents are toxic, for maximum protection of the patients, the concentration of the preservative is<br>
20	required to be kept at a minimum level to achieve required inhibition of the<br>
growth of the organisms.<br>
Of the prior art patents cited above, five of them are oil-in-water emulsions and use preservatives.   The requirement of the preservatives in these<br>
25	compositions is to provide preservative efficacy to the extent that there will be no<br>
more than 10 fold increase for at least 24 hours in growth of each of Vseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, after adventitious extrinsic contamination and the preservative used will be safe.<br>
30<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Edetate, Pentetate and Metabisulphite used in acidic pH fulfil the above test. However, Edetate and Pentetate deplete zinc from the body and Metabisulphite is harmful in the long run.<br>
5	Benzyl  alcohol,   sodium  ethylene  diamine tetraacetate;  benzethonium<br>
chloride and sodium benzoate are broadly classed as antimicrobial agents which delay onset or retard rate of growth to less than 1 logarithmic increase over a 24 hour period as compared to an unpreserved formulation. However, they are toxic in the long run.<br>
10<br>
Tromethamine used as a preservative in sterile intravenous fat emulsions is in an amount sufficient to prevent an at least ten fold increase in growth of microorganisms for at least 24 hours after extrinsic contamination. However, it causes extravasation at the site of injection and may cause tissue damage and also<br>
15	respiratory depression.<br>
Propofol:<br>
The Propofol compositions of the present invention typically comprise<br>
20	0,01% to 5% w/v of Propofol. Preferably the compositions comprise 0.1% to 2%<br>
w/v of Propofol. More preferably the compositions comprise about 1% and about 2% w/v of Propofol.<br>
Triglyceride:<br>
25<br>
The triglyceride oil(s) content in preferred compositions of the invention is up to 30% w/v of the composition, preferably in the range of 5% to 20% w/v of the composition, more preferably about 10% w/v and about 20% w/v of the composition.<br>
30<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Triglyceride oil suitable for the compositions of present invention include<br>
natural oils such as vegetable oils, or synthetic oils such as MCT oil.   Typically,<br>
the natural oil will be a vegetable oil and preferably is selected from the group<br>
consisting of Soybean oil, Sunflower oil, Safflower oil, Arachis oil, Cottonseed<br>
5	oil.   The synthetic oil typically is manufactured from a vegetable oil which is<br>
chemically and/or physically modified and/or purified. MCT oil is a typical<br>
example of synthetic oil and is obtained from the fixed oil extracted from the<br>
hard, dried fraction of the endosperm of Cocos nucifera L. Hydrolysis of the<br>
fixed oil followed by distillation yields the required fatty acids, which are then re-<br>
10	esterified to produce MCT oil (Medium-chain Triglycerides).     The present<br>
invention may also comprise any combination of one or more vegetable oils and / or synthetic oils. Soybean oil is the preferred natural vegetable oil used in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
15	Phosphatide:<br>
In the preferred compositions of present invention natural phosphatide is present in the range of 0.1% to 3% w/v, more preferably in the range of 0.6% to 1.5% w/v and most preferably about 1.2% w/v of the composition. 20<br>
In the oil-in water emulsion compositions of the present invention natural<br>
phosphatide is used as an emulsifier for stabilization of the oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
The preferred natural phosphatide used is either purified egg lecithin or purified<br>
soya lecithin or a mixture thereof.  More preferably the natural phosphatide used<br>
25	is purified egg lecithin.<br>
In  the  present  invention,   it  is  preferred  no  emulsifiers  other than phosphatides are used.<br>
30	Phosphatides are well known for forming liposomes when hydrated with<br>
aqueous media and are used in the present invention as emulsifier and for<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
stabilizing the emulsion. They are not used in the present forming liposomal compositions.<br>
Isotonic agents:<br>
5<br>
The composition of the present invention preferably is isotonic with blood by incorporating a suitable tonicity modifying agent such as Glycerin, Dextrose, or Mannitol. Glycerin is the preferred tonicity modifying agent.<br>
10	Monoglycerides:<br>
Fatty acid esters of the alcohol glycerol are called acylglycerols or glycerides. They are the major components of depot, or storage, fats in plant and animal cells, especially in the adipose cells of vertebrates.     When one of the<br>
15	hydroxyl   group   of  glycerol   is   esterified   with   fatty   acids,   it   is   called<br>
monoacylglycerols or monoglycerides. The saturated fatty acids include caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachadic acid, lignoceric acid. The unsaturated fatty acids include palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid.   The<br>
20	preferred monoglyceride is Monolaurin.<br>
Monolaurin:<br>
US-A-5714520 {supra) discloses that for effectiveness, the antimicrobial properties of any preservatives have to be exerted in the aqueous phase.    A<br>
25	preservative with lipophilic properties incorporated at typical usage levels would<br>
not be effective as although there would some partitioning between the phases, the concentration in the aqueous phase is insufficient to exert preservative effect. Increasing the overall quantity of such a preservative would result in unacceptably high levels of preservative in the lipid layer leading to toxicity problems at least.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
US-A-6469069 {supra) discloses that the preservative should be soluble in the aqueous phase and does not partition into the organic phase.<br>
Contrary to the teachings of both US-A-5714520 and US-A-6469069, it<br>
5	has surprisingly been found that the monoglyceride of lauric acid (Monolaurin)<br>
which has no aqueous solubility is effective as a preservative in a concentration as low as 0.01%.<br>
Food   grade   materials   as   preservatives   in   food,   cosmetics   and<br>
10	pharmaceutical preparations employing a combination of monoglycerides such as<br>
monolaurin, and medium chain fatty acids including caproic, caprylic fatty acids<br>
have been described in EP-A-0244144 (published 4th November 1987;<br>
corresponding to US-A- 6638978, issued 28th October 2003) and references<br>
therein. However, these compositions are not relevant for preserving oil-in-water<br>
15	emulsion compositions for intravenous administration.<br>
Monolaurin as a preservative in this system provides preservative efficacy<br>
to the extent that there will be no more than 10 fold increase for at least 24 hours<br>
in growth of each of Vseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus<br>
20	aureus and Candida albicans, after adventitious extrinsic contamination and it is<br>
toxicologically safe.<br>
Monolaurin as used in this application refers to all pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable glyceryl esters of lauric acid having molecular formula C15H30O4 and a<br>
25	molecular weight of about 274.4.   Commercially available Monolaurin is also<br>
known by other names such as "rac-1-Lauroylglycerol", "1-Monododecanoyl-rac-glycerol", "1-Monolauroyl-rac-glycerol", "rac-Glycerol 1-laurate", and "DL-a-Laurin".<br>
30	A mixture of 1 and 2 monoglycerides, or 2-monoglycerides of lauric acid<br>
are also Monolaurins.   Monolaurin may contain some diglycerides of lauric acid.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
The purity of Monolaurin is not critical, it should be rich in C12 (lauric) fatty acid but presence of some amounts of Cio, C14 etc fatty acids are acceptable.<br>
Monolaurin exhibits polymorphism,   a form, Ã' form and (3 form have<br>
5	been reported to have melting points of 44Â°C, 59.5Â°C and 63Â°C respectively.<br>
The nature of Monolaurin used in this invention is not critical as long as it<br>
fulfils the requirements of preventing significant growth of microorganisms for at<br>
least 24 hours in the event of adventitious extrinsic contamination as described<br>
10	above.   The requirements of the quantities may, to some extent, depend on the<br>
nature of the Monolaurin used.<br>
Monolaurin is insoluble in aqueous media but is highly soluble in the so-called fat solvents such as chloroform, benzene, ethanol, or acetone. 15<br>
In rats when Monolaurin is administered orally, the LD50 has been reported to be about 53,000 mg/kg body weight.<br>
It will be apparent to one skilled in the pharmaceutical arts that other<br>
20	monoglycerides such as Monostearin, Monopalmitin, Monocaprylin, Monoolein<br>
etc or mixture thereof may be used along with Monolaurin and that their<br>
concentration used preferably will be sufficient to prevent a no more than 10-fold<br>
increase in the growth of microbial cultures as described earlier. It will also be<br>
apparent to one skilled in the pharmaceutical arts that ethoxylated or propoxylated<br>
25	monoglycerides may be used to prevent a no more than 10-fold increase in the<br>
growth of microbial cultures as described earlier.<br>
HLB value of Monolaurin is less than 10 and therefore it is suitable as an<br>
emulsifier or solubiliser only for making water-in-oil emulsions and not oil-in-<br>
30	water emulsions.    It is used in small quantities in the present invention as a<br>
preservative and not as an emulsifier or as a solubiliser.<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
Compositions:<br>
Typically Monolaurin will be present in the composition of the present<br>
invention  in  a  concentration  range  of 0.001%  to   1.5%  w/v.     Preferably<br>
5	Monolaurin is present in the range of 0.01% to 1% w/v, more preferably 0.01% to<br>
0.5% w/v. The most preferred concentration of the Monolaurin is between 0.01%<br>
w/v and 0.1% w/v of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also be made as a<br>
10	concentrate containing higher quantities of lipophilic drugs and Monolaurin and<br>
appropriately diluted at the time of administration, for example emulsion<br>
concentrate containing higher quantities of Propofol and Monolaurin can be made<br>
and diluted appropriately at the time of administration. The weight ratio of<br>
Monolaurin to Propofol in such compositions is from 1 : 0.01 to 1 : 5000 by<br>
15	weight.   Preferably it is from 1 : 0.2 to 1 : 1000 by weight, more preferably it is<br>
from 1 : 4 to 1 : 200 by weight and most preferably it is from 1 : 20 to 1 : 100 by weight.<br>
The pH of the composition of the present invention usually is between 6 to<br>
8.5 and may be adjusted as required using an alkali for example Sodium<br>
20	hydroxide.<br>
A typical oil-in-water emulsion composition of the present invention comprises<br>
Propofol about 1 % w/v<br>
25	soybean oil about 10 %w/v<br>

Glycerin about 2.25% w/v<br>
Monolaurin about 0.01 % w/v<br>
Sodium hydroxide q.s. to adjust to required pH<br>
30	Water to 100%.<br>
In another composition, the Propofol is about 2 % w/v<br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
The Propofol-containing compositions of the invention can be prepared by a process comprising the steps of<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
15	Oil-in-water compositions with Monolaurin do not support microbial<br>
growth in case of accidental contamination. Further, compositions containing Monolaurin have been observed to be safe in mice when administered intravenously,<br>
20	Unlike sodium edetate and sodium pentetate, Monolaurin does not chelate<br>
trace metal ions from the biological system and therefore the safety profile is better than the products containing chelating / sequestering agents.<br>
Use of Monolaurin in Propofol compositions is better than use of sulphites<br>
25	because   sulphites make the product physically and chemically unstable on long<br>
term storage.    Sulphites have been reported to support lipid peroxidation in<br>
Propofol    emulsion    and    also    cause    allergic    reactions    on    intravenous<br>
administration.<br>
30	For long term use, benzoates and benzyl alcohol may cause toxicity on<br>
intravenous administration whereas Monolaurin can be used without induction of any toxicity (for over 7 days).<br><br><br>
PPA-PRO/001<br>
The products of present invention give a Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition that can be used for intravenous administration for prolonged period required clinically without the fear of microbial contamination and infection.<br>
5	The  oil-in-water  intravenous  fat  emulsion  compositions   of present<br>
invention can be used as a total parenteral nutrition mixture for a prolonged period without the fear of microbial contamination and infection.<br>
Oil-in-water   emulsion   compositions   of present   invention   containing<br>
10	hydrophilic / and lipophilic drugs can be used for a prolonged period without the<br>
fear of microbial contamination and infection.<br>
