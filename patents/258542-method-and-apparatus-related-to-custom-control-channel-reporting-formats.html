QUALCOMM INCORPORATED,<br>
an American company of 5775 Morehouse Drive , San Diego, California 92121-1714, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/097804<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048674<br><br>
METHODS AND APPARATUS RELATED TO CUSTOM CONTROL CHANNEL REPORTING FORMATS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to wireless communications methods and apparatus and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for implementing and using control channels.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]     In multiple access wireless communications systems, multiple wireless terminals are typically in competition for limited air link resources. A wireless terminal, operating in a state supporting uplink and downlink user data traffic signaling, typically tries-to routinely communicate control information to a base station attachment point. In some systems control information may be communicated in the form of control information reports which allow the base station attachment point to obtain information about the wireless terminal status and effectively allocate resources. As the popularity and variety of wireless communication services has increased, the need to support ever larger numbers of concurrent users has grown. In addition, events and/or time of day can drive peak concurrent user demand.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
2<br>
[0003]     Changes in the number of.concurrent users can affect the demand for control information communication resources. However, it should also be appreciated that different wireless terminals can have different needs at different times and that the demand for resources in many cases is not simply a matter of the total number of terminals in the system that have the ability to communicate user data to the base station.<br>
[0004]     Different wireless terminals using the same base station attachment point often have different reporting needs and priorities. For example, a first wireless terminal operating from a current stationary position, with no or minimal obstructions between itself and the base station attachment point, and needing to communicate small amounts of user data infrequently may have very different control information reporting needs than another, e.g., second, wireless terminal, e.g., a mobile node in a moving automobile, experiencing rapidly changing channel conditions and/or needing to communicate large amounts of data frequently. Using a .universal single control information reporting format to report control information to a base station although simple to implement can result in inefficiencies due to tradeoffs made to accommodate the wide variety of different types of anticipated concurrent users with reasonable degree of effectiveness.<br>
[0005]     In view of the above, it should be appreciated that there is a need for methods and apparatus which provide flexibility with regard to control information reporting, e.g., flexibility in terms of supported report formats. Improved methods and/or apparatus which tend to match a wireless terminal's current needs and/or conditions to a well suited control information report format would tend to increase efficiency and be beneficial, e.g., in terms of increasing traffic throughput capability. The ability to change control information reporting formats, if it could be supported, could also be useful in some cases.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]     Various embodiments are directed to methods and apparatus related to control information reporting over wireless communication channels including<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
communicating control information format definition information over a wireless link. For example, in some embodiments, a base station downloads reporting format definition information, e.g., corresponding to a new release or a custom reporting format, into a wireless terminal. The reporting format information may define, e.g., control information report formats. The reporting format information may include, e.g., one or more report definitions. In some but not necessarily all embodiments the report format information may specify content to be included in one or more reports in addition to report transmission scheduling information indicating a schedule according to which defined reports should be transmitted. As another example, a wireless terminal generates a custom reporting format, that it intends to use, and communicates report format definition information corresponding to the generated custom reporting format to a base station.<br>
[0007]     An exemplary method of operating a first communications device, e.g., a wireless terminal, which interacts with a second communications device, e.g., a base station, includes: performing at least one of receiving and transmitting control information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link. In some embodiments a wireless terminal receives report format definition information while in other embodiments it generates and transmits such information. In various exemplary embodiments, the first communications device generates a control information report in accordance with received and/or transmitted reporting format definition information. An exemplary communications device, e.g., wireless terminal, in accordance with some but not necessarily all embodiments, includes: at least one of: i) a receiver module for receiving control information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link and ii) a transmitter module for transmitting control information reporting format definition information via a wireless communications link. The communications device may also include a control information report generation module for generating a control information report in accordance with at least one of i) received reporting format definition information and ii) transmitted reporting format definition information.<br>
[0008]     An exemplary method of operating a first communications device, e.g., a base station, which interacts with a second communications device, e.g., a wireless<br>

WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
terminal, in accordance with some embodiments, includes: performing at least one of receiving report format definition information from a wireless communications link and transmitting report format definition information over a wireless communications link. .The report definition information may define a control information report format. In one such exemplary embodiment, the first communication device recovers control information corresponding to a received control information report in accordance with one of received reporting format definition information and transmitted reporting format definition information. A communications device, e.g., a base station, in some but not necessarily all embodiments, includes: at least one of: i) a receiver module for receiving control information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link and ii) a transmitter module for transmitting control information reporting format definition information via a wireless communications link. In such an exemplary embodiment the communications device may further include a control information report recovery module for recovering control information reports' information in accordance with at least one of i) received reporting format definition information and ii) transmitted reporting format definition information.<br>

format indicating a reporting schedule and a set of report definitions. The report format selection module 320 includes: an input for receiving application type information 308, an input for receiving user quality of service information 312, an input for receiving channel condition information 314, an input for receiving device capability information 316, an input for receiving system loading information 318, and an input for receiving a report format selection control signal 306.<br>
[0044]     In some embodiments, report format selection module 320 selects a reporting format as a function of an application being executed by one of said communications device and another communications device. In some such embodiments, said application is one of a voice and a data application. In some embodiments, the reporting format stored in memory that is selected in response .to a voice application includes a latency report. In some embodiments, the reporting format stored in memory that is selected in response to a data application includes less frequent uplink request reports than the format selected in response to a voice application but more bits per uplink request on average than used for reports selected in response to a voice application. For example, a reporting format used for a voice application may use 1 bit uplink request reports and a 1 bit uplink request report may be included in each successive dedicated control channel segment, while a reporting format used for a data application may use 4 bit uplink request reports, and a 4 bit uplink request report may be included in once for every 4 successive dedicated control channel segments.<br>
[0045]     In various embodiments, the report format selection module 320 selects a reporting format as a function of at least one of device capability information, user quality of service information, channel condition information 314, and system loading information 318. Device capability information includes, e.g., number of antennas; number of antennas per channel; device classification information, e.g., strong receiver, weak receiver, voice capable, data capable, voice and data capable, stationary device, low velocity mobile device, high velocity mobile device; rate capability information; power capability information; remaining battery power information, etc.<br>
[0046]     Receiver module 304 is coupled to receive antenna 302 via which the communication devices receives signals. In some embodiments, received signals<br>

WO 2007/097804<br><br>
12<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048674<br><br>
include a report format selection contro.l signal 306, e.g., a command from a base station to switch to a particular reporting format. The received signal 306 is conveyed to the report format selection module 306 which selects the format as a function received . signal 306.<br>
[0047]     The report format selection module 320 is coupled to memory 324 via bus 322. Memory 324 includes a plurality of predetermined reporting format<br>
infonnation sets (reporting format 1 information 326	reporting format N information<br>
334) and report definition information (report definition 1 information 336,..., report definition X information 338). Report definition information, e.g., report definition 1 information 336, specifies a type of control information and control information to bit mapping information to be communicated in a report, e.g., an SNR report format, a traffic request report format, a power information report format, an interference request format. Report format 1 information 326 includes a reporting schedule 328, a set of report definitions 330, and a coding and modulation scheme 332. The set of report definitions 330 identifies a subset of set of report definitions (336,.., 338) used when the wireless terminal is operating in reporting format 1. The reporting schedule 328 includes infonnation identifying a sequence of reports to be communicated within a reporting structure, e.g., a predetermined recuning reporting structure, when using reporting format 1. Coding and modulation scheme 332 identifies a coding and modulation scheme to be used to communicate control information reports when using reporting format 1, e.g., BPSK or QPSK, a number of information bits per. segment, a number of coded bits per segment, and a mapping between coded bits and modulation symbols.<br>
[0048]     Report generation module 342 generates a sequence of reports 354 in accordance with the selected reporting schedule and at least some definitions in the set of report definitions. Report generation module 342 includes a plurality of different report type generation modules (report type 1 generation module 348,.., report type X generation module 350) and a multiplexer module 352. Report type 1 generation module 348 implements the report definition 1 336 mapping report control infonnation 344 to generate a set of control information report bits 349. For example, consider that report type 1 is a 4 bit uplink traffic channel request report which communicates<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
backlog information about queued frames of information waiting to be communicated. In one such a case module 348 maps a count of frames to a quantization level represented by one of the sixteen potential 4 bit pattern which can be communicated by the report. Similarly report type X generation module 350 implements the report definition X 338 mapping report control information 346 to generate a set of control information report bits 351. For example, consider that report type X is a 5 bit SNR report. In one such case module 350 maps a determined SNR level to a quantization level represented by one of the thirty-two potential 5 bit patterns which can be communicated by the report.<br>
[0049]     Report format selection module 320 sends report generation control signal 340 to report generation module 342 to control which reports are to be generated and the sequencing of the reporting in accordance with the selected reporting format to be implemented. For example, control signal 340 enables a sub-set of report generation modules corresponding to the set of report definition corresponding to the selected reporting format. Report format selection module 320 also sends a control signal 356 to the transmitter module 358 to control the coding and modulation scheme to be implemented by coding and modulation module 360 corresponding to the selected reporting format. Coding and modulation module 360 performs a coding and modulation operation on the generated sequence of reports using a predetermined coding and modulation scheme corresponding to selected reporting format. For example, in one exemplary embodiment for one particular reporting format, a first coding and modulation scheme is used where the sequences of reports are grouped into sets of 6 information bits and the six information bits are coded into 21 QPSK modulation symbols. In the same exemplary embodiment, for another particular reporting format, a second coding and modulation scheme is used where the sequence of reports are grouped into sets of 8 information bits, and the eight information bits are coded into 21 QPSK modulation symbols. In some embodiments, different reporting formats may correspond to different modulation constellations, e.g., a BPSK modulation constellation and a QPSK modulation constellation. Transmitter module 358, e.g., an OFDM transmitter, transmits OFDM signals including the sequence of generated reports via transmit antenna 362. The generated sequence of reports, in some embodiments, corresponds to dedicated control channel reports.<br>

For example, the first communications device may be a wireless terminal and the second communications device may be a base station, said first and second communication devices being included in a multiple access wireless communications system, e.g., an OFDM multiple access wireless communications system.<br>
[0084]     Operation starts in step 1002, where the first communications device is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 1002 to step 1004. In step 1004, the first communication device uses a default report format as a current reporting format when communicating with said second communications device. Then, in step 1006, the first communications device performs at least one of receiving and transmitting control information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link. In some embodiments, the reporting format definition   • information is received from a base station, e.g., the base station which the first communications device is using as its current attachment point. In some embodiments, the reporting format definition information is received from a centralized server. Operation proceeds from step 1006 to step 1008.<br>
[0085]     In step 1008, the first communications device checks at least one of device capability information, channel conditions, application information, quality of service information and system loading. Then, in step 1010, the first communications device determines if the result of the check of step 1008 indicates that the reporting • ' format should be changed. If the determination of step 1010 is that the reporting format<br>

should be changed, then opertion proceeds to step 1012; otherwise, operation proceeds to step 1014. In step 1012, the first wireless terminal switches the current reporting format to a new reporting format, e.g., said new reporting format in accordance with said control.information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link. Operation proceeds from step 1012 to step 1014. In step 1014, the first communications abvice generates a controf information report in accordance with the current report format definition information. Operation proceeds from step 1014 to step 1008, where the first communication device performs another check of at least one of device capability information, channel condition, application information, quality of service mformation and"system loading.<br>
[0086]     In some embodiments, the reporting format provides a definition mapping information to be included in said report to possible report values. In various embodiments, the reporting format further defines a reporting schedule according to which reports are to be transmitted. in some, the reporting format defines a set of reports which are to be transmitted in accordance with the defined reporting schedule. A reporting forrnat may, and sometime does, specify a coding and modulation scheme to be applied tlo aset of reports.<br>

Fourth row 1614 indicates that exemplary WT 4 is a multiple antenna device, and the DCCH reporting format being used includes additional SNR reports for reporting various alternatives. Fifth row 1616 indicates that exemplary WT 5 is experiencing low battery power level, and the DCCH reporting format being used has less segments per unit time to conserve energy. Sixth row 1618 indicates that exemplary WT 6 is a stationary device, and the DCCH reporting format being used less frequently reports SNR and transmission power information, e.g., transmission power backoff information.

reports SNR and transmission power information, e.g., transmission power backoff ' information. Eighth row 1622 indicates that exemplary WT 8 includes an expensive high quality receiver, and the DCCH reporting format being used omits self-noise reports. Ninth row 1624 indicates that exemplary WT 9 is using an isolated base station, and the DCCH reporting format being used omits interference reports comparing signals from different base stations, e.g., beacon ratio reports are not included. Tenth row 1626 indicates that exemplary WT 10 is experiencing very good and stable channel conditions, and the DCCH reporting format being used includes an SNR report that has a narrow range around relatively high values, and the DCCH reporting format being used includes at least some differential reports, e.g., delta reports with respect to previously communicated DCCH reports.

Twelfth row 1630 indicates that exemplary WT 12 is experiencing widely varying channel conditions, and the DCCH reporting format being used include an SNR report that has a wide reporting range. Thirteenth row 1632 indicates that exemplary WT 13 is using a base station experiencing high system loading, and the DCCH reporting format being used has less segments allocated to WT per time interval to free up resources for the other wireless terminals. Fourteenth row 1634 indicates that exemplary WT 14 has high QoS requirements, and the DCCH reporting format being used provides for additional opportunities for traffic requests.

[00104]     Figure 17 is a drawing 1700 of exemplary uplink dedicated control channel (DCCH) segments in an exemplary uplink timing and frequency structure in an exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access wireless communications system. The uplink dedicated control channel is used to send Dedicated Control Reports (DCR) from wireless terminals to base stations. Vertical axis 1702 plots logical uplink tone index while horizontal axis 1704 plots the uplink index of the halfslot within a beaconslot. In this example, an uplink tone block includes 113 logical uplink tones indexed (0,..., 112); there are seven successive OFDM symbol transmission time periods within a halfslot, 2 additional OFDM symbol time periods<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
35<br>
followed by 16 successive half-slots within a superslot, and 8 successive superslots within a beacon slot.' The first 9 OFDM symbol transmission time periods within a superslot are an access interval, and the dedicated control channel does not use the air link resources of the access interval.<br>
[00105]     The exemplary dedicated control channel is subdivided into 31 logical' tones (uplink tone index 81 1706, uplink tone index 82 1708,..., uplink tone index 111 1710). Each logical uplink tone (81,..., 111) in the logical uplink frequency structure corresponds to a logical tone indexed with respect to the DCCH channel (0,..., 30).<br>
[00106]     For each tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments in the beaconslot corresponding to forty columns (1712,1714, 1716,1718,1720,1722, ... 1724). The segment structure repeats on a beaconslot basis. For a given tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments corresponding to a beaconslot 1728; each of the eight superslots of the beaconslot includes 5 successive segments for the .given tone. For example, for first superslot 1726 of beaconslot 1728, corresponding to tone 0 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [0][0], segment [0][1], segment [0][2], segment [0][3], segment [0][4]). Similarly, for first superslot 1726 of beaconslot 1728, corresponding to tone 1 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [1][0], segment [1][1], segment [1][2], segment [1][3J, segment [1][4]). Similarly, for first superslot 1726 of beaconslot 1728, corresponding to tone 30 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [30][0], segment [30][1], segment [30][2], segment [30][3], segment [30][4]).<br>
. [00107]     In this example each segment, e.g., segment [0][0J, comprises one tone for 3 successive half-slots, e.g., representing an allocated uplink air link resource of 21 OFDM tone-symbols. In some embodiments, logical uplink tones are hopped to physical tones in accordance with an uplink tone hopping sequence such that the physical tone associated with a logical tone may be different for successive half-slots, •but remains constant during a given half-slot.<br>
[00108]     Each logical tone of the dedicated control channel may be assigned by the base station to a different wireless terminal using the base station as its current point<br>
36<br><br>

of attachment. For example, logical tone (506, 508,... ,510) may be currently assigned to (WT A 1730, WT B .1732,..., Wt N' 1734), respectively.<br>
[00109]     Each uplink DCCH segment is used to transmit a set of Dedicated Control Channel Reports (DCRs). A list of exemplary DCRs is given in table 1800 of Figure 18.    First column 1802 of table 1800 describes abbreviated names used for each exemplary report. The name of each report ends with a number which specifies the number of bits of the. DCR. Second column 1804 of table 1800 briefly describes each named report.<br>
[00110]     Figure 19 is a table 1900 describing the exemplary format of exemplary 5 bit absolute report of downlink signal to noise ratio (DLSNR5). Column 1902 lists the 32 possible information bit patterns for the report, and column 1904 lists a corresponding reported WT measured downlink pilot channel SNR conveyed by the report. A wireless terminal measures downlink pilot channel SNR, determines the SNR reported value possibility closest to the measured value, and then determines the corresponding 5 bit pattern to be reported in the report. Each report in table 1800 has its own corresponding mapping information.<br>
[00111 ]     Figure 20 is a drawing 2099 illustrating an exemplary reporting format information in an exemplary beaconslot for a given DCCH tone, e.g., corresponding to a wireless terminal. In Figure 20, each block (2000, 2001,2002,2003,2004,2005, 2006, 2007,2008, 2009, 2010,2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,2015, 2016, 2017, 2018,2019,2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032,2033,2034, 2035, 2036, 2037, 2038, 2039) represents one segment whose index s2 (0,..., 39) is shown above the block in rectangular region 2040. Each block, e.g., block 2000 representing segment 0, conveys 6 information bits; each block comprises 6 rows corresponding to the 6 bits in the segment, where the bits are listed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit downwards from the top row to the bottom row as shown in rectangular region 2043.<br>
[00112]     Figure 20 illustrates one exemplary reporting format, e.g., a default reporting format. Numerous variations are possible. Some reporting formats may be<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
additional pre-stored reporting formats. Some reporting formats may be custom reporting formats, e.g., tailored for a particular wireless terminal, set of wireless terminals, type of wireless terminal, and/or set of conditions. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, use different numbers of information bits/segment, e.g., 8 information bit/per segment instead of 6 information bits/segment. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, use different modulation schemes. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiment, have a different set of reports used. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, have different orderings and/or frequencies of reports. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiment, intentionally omit certain types of reports. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, have a concentration of certain types of reports. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, use different sets of segments. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, refrain from transmitting of subsets of segments. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, have different durations, e.g., different durations of a recurring pattern.<br>
[00113]     Different wireless terminals may be using different control information reporting formats at the same time. In addition the same wireless terminal may use different control information reporting formats at different times.<br>
[00114]     Figure 21 is a drawing of a flowchart 2100 of an exemplary method of operating a base station to interact with one or more wireless terminals. Operation starts in step 2102, where the base station is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 2104, for each wireless terminal of some wireless terminals allocated a dedicated control channel by the base station. At different times different wireless terminals are . allocated dedicated control channels by the base station. In addition, in the communications system, some wireless terminal may support a plurality of control information reporting formats, while some less capable wireless terminals may support a single control informationreporting format.<br>
[00115]     In step 2104, the base station determines a set of control information reports to be received, said set of control information reports corresponding to a reporting format. Step 2104 includes sub-step 2106. In sub-step 2106, the base station<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
38<br>
selects between a plurality of predetermined reporting formats. Sub-step 2106 includes one or more of sub-step 2108, 2110, and 2112. In sub-step 2108, the base station selects the control information reporting format as a function of an application being executed, e.g., by said base station or said wireless terminal or a peer node in a communications session with said wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the application is one of a voice and a data application. In some such embodiments, a reporting format selected in response to a voice application includes a latency report or includes latency information embedded in a traffic channel request report, and a reporting format selected in response to a data application includes less frequent uplink request reports than a reporting format used for voice but more bits per uplink request on average than used for voice. For example, frequently scheduled 1 bit uplink request reports may be used in an exemplary reporting format tailored for a voice application, while less frequently scheduled 3 and/or 4 bit uplink traffic channel request reports may be used in an exemplary reporting format tailored for a data application. In sub-step 2110, the base station selects the control information reporting format as a function of at least one of: device, capability information, channel condition information, system loading information, and user quality of service (QoS) information. In sub-step 2112, the base station selects the control information reporting format as a function of at least one of: a command signal or a request signal received from said wireless terminal.<br>
[00116]     In some embodiments, each of said plurality of predetermined reporting formats specifies a plurality of different types of reports and an ordering of said different types of reports. In some embodiments, the different reporting types includes at least two of a SNR report, a traffic request report, a power information report, an interference report, and a delay report, e.g., a latency report. In some embodiments, the reporting format specifies the control information to be communicated in the different types of reports, e.g., counts of frames of traffic backlog with defined quanitization, SNR level in dB with defined quantization, power gain level in dBs with defined quantization, etc.<br>
[00117]     Operation proceeds from step 2104 to step 2114. Instep2114,.thebase station receives signals, e.g., dedicated control channel segment OFDM signals, conveying said determined set of reports. Then, in step 2116, the base station performs<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2007/097804	PCT/US2006/048674<br>
-39<br>
a demodulation and decoding operation on said received signals to generate sets of ordered information bits, each set of ordered information bits corresponding to a communications segment. Step 2116 includes sub-step 2118. In sub-step 2118, the base station uses a predetermined decoding and demodulation scheme corresponding to said reporting format, different decoding and demodulation schemes being used for at least some of said plurality of reporting formats. For example, in one exemplary embodiment one exemplary control information reporting format uses a demodulation and decoding scheme which obtains 6 information bits from 21 QPSK modulation symbols corresponding to a dedicated control channel communications segment; while a different exemplary control information format uses a demodulation and decoding scheme which obtains 8 information bits from 21 QPSK modulation symbols corresponding to a dedicated control channel communications segment. Operation proceeds from step 2116 to step 2120.<br>
[00118]     In. step 2110, the base station maps the ordered bits of a segment to one or more control information reports in accordance with said reporting format. For example, corresponding to one exemplary control information reporting format, a first segment in a recurring structure may convey 6 ordered information bits, and bits 1-5 convey a 5 bit downlink SNR report, while bit 0 (LSb) conveys a 1 bit uplink traffic channel request report. Operation proceeds from step 2120 to step 2122.<br>
[00119]     In step 2122, the base station recovers information from said set of determined control information reports in accordance with said reporting format. For example, the bit pattern, e.g.,. 01110, of a received SNR report may report a pilot channel SNR measurement value, e.g., 2 dB.<br>
[00120]     Operation proceeds from step 2122 to step 2104, where the base station determines another set of control information reports to be received by the wireless terminal assuming the wireless terminal is still allocated a dedicated control channel by the base station.<br>
[00121]     In some embodiments, the received signals, e.g., dedicated control channel segment signals, from multiple wireless terminal using the base station are<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2007/097804<br><br>
40<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048674<br><br>
received concurrently, and the control information reporting format for at least some of the different wireless terminals, at at least some times is different For example, a first wireless terminal communicating with the base station may be using a control information reporting format tailored for a yoice application, and a second wireless terminal communicating with the base station may be using a control information reporting format tailored to delay insensitive data communications, e.g., file transfers.<br>
[00122]     Figure 22 is a drawing of a flowchart 2200 of an exemplary method of operating a base station to interact with one or more wireless terminals. For example, the base station and wireless terminal may be part of a multiple access OFDM wireless communications system including a dedicated control channel for uplink control information reports and using dedicated control channel segments. Operation starts in step 2202, where the base station is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 2202 to step 2204, for each wireless terminal of some wireless terminals allocated a dedicated control channel by a base station. In step 2204, the base station uses a default format as a current reporting format when communicating with said wireless terminal, e.g., as part of an initial communications with the wireless terminal.<br>
[00123]     Operation proceeds from step 2204 to step 2206, where the base station . performs at least one of receiving and transmitting control information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information providing definition mapping information to be included in said report to possible report values. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information defining a reporting schedule according to which reports are to be transmitted. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information defining a set of reports which are to be transmitted, e.g., by a wireless terminal to the base station, in accordance with the defined reporting schedule. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information specifying a coding and modulation scheme to be applied to the set of reports.<br>

[00124]   • Then, in step 2208, the base station checks at least one of device capability information, channel condition information, application information, quality of service information, system loading information, and the reception of a control information format switching command or request from said wireless terminal.<br>
[00125]     In step 2210, the base station decides how to proceed based on the result of the check of step 2208. If the result of the check indicates that the reporting format should be changed, operation proceeds to step 2212; otherwise operation proceeds to step 2214.<br>
[00126]     In step 2212, the base station switches the current reporting format to a new reporting format, e.g., said new reporting format in accordance with said control information reporting format definition information received or transmitted from a wireless communication link of step 2206. Operation proceeds from step 2212 to step 2214.<br>
[00127] In step 2214, the base station recovers control information corresponding to a received control information report in accordance with the current reporting format. Operation proceeds from step 2214 to step 2208, where the base station perform another check.<br>
[00128]     In some embodiments, reporting format information, e.g., corresponding to customized control information reports, is communicated between a base station and a wireless terminal using the base station as its attachment point. Li some embodiments, reporting format information corresponding to a wireless terminal is communicated to and/or stored at a centralized server and/or a home agent node! In some such embodiments, state information corresponding to a control information reporting format, for a wireless terminal is stored, e.g., in a centralized server, home agent node, and/or base station. In some embodiments such stored information can,- and sometimes is, retrieved and transferred to a new base station, e.g., as part of a handoff process and/or initialization process when attaching to a new base station.<br>
