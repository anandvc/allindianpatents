BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
31-10-2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>

The present invention relates to novel pyrazolylbiphenylcarboxamides, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use for controlling undesirable microorganisms.<br>
It is already known that numerous carboxanilides have fungicidal properties (compare WO 93/11 117, EP-A 0 545 099, EP-A 0 589 301, WO 99/09013, DE 198 40 322). Thus, N-(2-cyclohexyl)-l,3-dimethyl-5-fiuoropyrazole-4-carboxanilide, N-(2-phenyl)-l,3-dimethyl-pyrazole-4-carboxanilide and N-2[2-(2-fluoro-phenyl)]-l,3-dimethyl-pyrazole-4-carboxanilide can be employed for controlling fungi. The activity of these substances is good; however, in some cases it is unsatisfactory at low application rates.<br>
This invention, accordingly, provides novel pyrazolylbiphenylcarboxamides of the formula (I)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Finally, it has been found that the novel pyrazolylbiphenylcarboxamides of the<br>
formula (I) have very good microbicidal properties and can be used for controlling<br>
undesirable microorganisms both in crop protection and in the protection of<br>
10	materials.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have<br>

1	The list of these fungi by no means limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only<br>
	for illustration.<br>
I	The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
1	forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
I        powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a<br>
20	customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting,<br>
dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active<br>
compounds by the ultra-low volume method, or to inject the active compound<br>
preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the<br>
seeds of the plants.<br>
25<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of<br>

The compositions used for protecting industrial materials comprise the active compounds generally in an amount of from 1 to 95%, preferably from 10 to 75%.<br>
The use concentrations of the active compounds according to the invention depend<br>
on the nature and occurrence of the microorganisms to be controlled and on the<br>
composition of the material to be protected. The optimum amount employed can be<br>
10	determined by a series of tests. In general, the use concentrations are in the range<br>

The activity and the activity spectrum of the active compounds to be used according to the invention in material protection, or the compositions, concentrates or quite generally formulations preparable therefrom can be increased by adding, if appropriate, further antimicrobially active compounds, fungicides, bactericides, herbicides, insecticides or other active compounds for widening the activity spectrum or obtaining particular effects, such as, for example, additional protection against insects. These mixtures may have a wider activity spectrum than the compounds according to the invention.<br>

Process (a):<br>
At room temperature, a solution of 1.3 g (0.0057 mol) of 2"-amino-l,l"-biphenyl-4-carbaldehyde O-methyloximine in 20 ml of toluene is admixed with 0.57 g (0.0057 mol) of triethylamine. At room temperature, a solution of 1.0 g (0.0057 mol) of 5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chloride in 5 ml of toluene is added dropwise with stirring to this mixture. After the addition has ended, the reaction mixture is heated to 50Â°C and stirred at this temperature for a further 2 h. For workÂ¬up,, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, mixed with another 25 mJ of toluene and washed with water. The organic phase is separated off, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue that remains is recrystallized from diisopropyl ether. In this manner, 1.45 g (69.4% of theory) of 5-fluoro-N- {4"-[(methoxyimino)methyl]-l, 1 "-biphenyl-2-yl}-1,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide are obtained as colourless crystals of melting point 114 toll6Â°C.<br>

The reaction mixture is then heated to reflux temperature and kept at this temperature for 15 h. For work-up, the reaction mixture is stirred into 200 ml of water. The resulting precipitate is filtered off with suction and dried. The residue that remains is chromatographed on silica gel using the mobile phase cyclohexane : ethyl acetate = 1:1. Concentration of the eluate gives 0.20 g (48% of theory) of N-{3,5-difluoro-4"-[(methoxyimino)methyl]-1,1 "-biphenyl-2-yl} -5-fluoro-l ,3-dimethyl- lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide in the form of a solid of melting point 164 to 167Â°C.<br><br>

For work-up, the reaction mixture is stirred into 400 ml of water and the precipitate is filtered off with suction and dried. The crude product is then purified by silica gel column chromatography using the mobile phase cyclohexane : ethyl acetate =1:1.

For work-up, the reaction mixture is stirred into water and the resulting precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed with water and then with a little diisopropyl ether and dried. This gives 0.91 g (85.4% of theory) of 5-fluoro-N-[4"-(N-methoxyethaneimidoyl)-l,r-biphenyl-2-yl]-l,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide of melting point 153Â°C. !H-NMR spectrum (DMSO/TMS): 5 = 3.60 ppm. <br><br><br><br>

Solvents:	24.5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
24.5 parts by weight of dimethylacetamide<br>
Emulsifier:	1.0 part by weight of alkyl-aryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
To test for protective activity, young plants are sprayed with the preparation of active compound at the stated application rate. After the spray coating has dried on, the plants are inoculated with an aqueous conidia suspension of the apple scab pathogen Venturia inaequalis and then remain in an incubation cabin at approximately 20Â°C and 100% relative atmospheric humidity for 1 day.<br>
The plants are then placed in a greenhouse at approximately 21Â°C and a relative atmospheric humidity of approximately 90%.<br>
Evaluation is carried out 12 days after the inoculation. 0% means an efficacy which corresponds to that of the control, whereas an efficacy of 100% means that no infection is observed.<br>
