Cable connector for printed circuit boards<br>
The invention relates to a cable connector for printed circuit<br>
boards.<br>
DE 102 57 308 B3 has disclosed a connector for printed circuit<br>
boards, comprising a number of contact elements, the contact<br>
elements each having two connection sides, one connection side<br>
being in the form of an insulation displacement contact for<br>
connecting wires and the other connection side being in the form<br>
of a fork contact for making contact with connection areas on a<br>
printed circuit board, and a plastic housing in which the insulation<br>
displacement contacts of the contact elements can be inserted,<br>
the insulation displacement contact and the fork contact being<br>
arranged such that they are rotated towards one another, and at<br>
least one lower edge of the insulation displacement contact being<br>
supported on the plastic housing such that the contact elements<br>
are held in the plastic housing such that they are secured against<br>
falling out in the event of connection forces occurring on the<br>
insulation displacement contacts, the plastic housing comprising<br>
at least one region in the form of a chamber, and the fork<br>
contacts being completely accommodated in the longitudinal<br>
direction by the plastic housing, ribs being arranged on the inner<br>
sides in the region in the form of a chamber and defining the<br>
guides for the fork contacts, the contact regions of the fork<br>
contacts protruding beyond the ribs, and the ribs being beveled in<br>
the front region.<br>
Such cable connectors serve the purpose, for example, together<br>
with a housing part which bears the printed circuit board, of<br>
forming a distribution board connection module, which has also<br>
already been described in DE 102 57 308 B3.<br>
Such a distribution board connection module is also already<br>
known from DE 100 29 649 A1, comprising a housing in which<br>
input and output contacts are arranged such that they are<br>
accessible from the outside for connecting lines and wires, the<br><br>
housing being formed with a cavity in which functional elements<br>
are arranged between the input and output contacts. The<br>
functional elements are arranged on at least one printed circuit<br>
board which is supported in the housing, the functional elements<br>
providing, for example, overvoltage protection. In addition, the<br>
functional elements may also be filter circuits such as XDSL<br>
splitters.<br>
The arrangement of the filter circuit on the same printed circuit<br>
board as the surge arresters has a few disadvantages, however.<br>
In addition to the increased production complexity in terms of<br>
population, in particular the number of contact points required for<br>
the line path is increased. However, the reliability of the<br>
distribution board connection module is thus decreased in<br>
particular if these contact points need to withstand high current<br>
loads. In addition, owing to the placement of the surge arresters<br>
on the main board, the physical area available there for the filter<br>
circuits is decreased. Furthermore, surge arresters usually require<br>
greater copper thicknesses, which is likewise reflected in the<br>
costs and space requirement. Such main boards are generally<br>
designed for a plurality of subscribers and are arranged in<br>
stacked fashion in rack systems. Furthermore, the complete main<br>
board needs to be removed in order to replace a defective surge<br>
arrester. In this case, subscribers which are not involved would<br>
also be interrupted and adversely affected. As an alternative, the<br>
surge arresters could also be plugged onto the cable connector<br>
from above, in this case, however, the contacts no longer being<br>
freely accessible for jumpering.<br>
The invention is based on the technical problem of providing a<br>
cable connector by means of which overvoltage protection of the<br>
wires or lines to be connected can be implemented in a simple<br>
and cost-effective manner.<br>
The solution to the technical problem is given by the subject<br><br>
matter having the features of claim 1. Further, advantageous<br>
refinements of the invention are described in the subclaims.<br>
For this purpose, a surge arrester which is arranged within the<br>
housing is arranged electrically between the contact elements.<br>
This brings about a number of advantages. Firstly, a main board<br>
can now be used more effectively in terms of space. Secondly,<br>
the overvoltage protection takes place even before the main<br>
board and overvoltages can be dissipated directly at the point of<br>
entry. In particular, in embodiments having only two contact<br>
elements per subscriber, the cable connector may be withdrawn<br>
in the case of defective surge arresters and the defective surge<br>
arrester or the cable connector as a whole can be replaced<br>
without the other subscribers being disrupted. In an embodiment<br>
having four contact elements, only one other subscriber would be<br>
disrupted.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the surge arrester is connected to<br>
the contact elements such that it can be detached. This means<br>
that, in the event of there being a defect in the surge arrester,<br>
only this surge arrester need be replaced and not the complete<br>
cable connector. Furthermore, this also has advantages as<br>
regards ease of recycling.<br>
In order to arrange the surge arrester such that it can be<br>
detached, in each case a further fork contact is preferably<br>
arranged on the contact elements. The shape of the fork contacts<br>
is in this case preferably matched to the shape of the contacts of<br>
the surge arrester.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, the fork contacts for the<br>
printed circuit board (main board) and the surge arresters are<br>
aligned parallel to one another, the fork contact for the printed<br>
circuit board (main board) being arranged in the region of the<br>
side walls of the housing, and the fork contact for the surge<br>
arrester being moved laterally inwards. This makes optimum use<br><br>
of the physical space for the cable connector, since the surge arrester is<br>
positioned between the fork contacts for the printed circuit board (main board).<br>
The fork contact for the printed circuit board preferably protrudes up to the<br>
lower edge of the housing such that it is largely guided in the housing.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, the fork contact for the surge arrester is<br>
moved back into the housing and/or is displaced parallel to the fork contact such<br>
that the surge arrester with which contact has been made does not hinder the<br>
insertion process on the printed circuit board.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, the surge arrester is arranged on a separate<br>
printed circuit board, which significantly simplifies in particular the replacement<br>
process.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, fine protection elements such as PTC<br>
resistors and diodes are arranged on the printed circuit board (main board).<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, the housing of the cable connector is of<br>
two-part design.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, the contact elements are of two-part design,<br>
one contact part comprising the contact for connecting the wires and the other<br>
contact part comprising the fork contact for the printed circuit board (main<br>
board), each contact part comprising a resilient contact arm which together form<br>
an isolating contact.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to a<br>
preferred exemplary embodiment. In the figures;<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view from below of the cable connector without a<br>
lower housing part,<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view from below of the cable<br>
connector with a lower housing part,<br>
Figure 3 shows a side view of the cable connector with an upper<br>
and a lower housing part,<br>
Figure 4 shows a cross section along the section A-A,<br>
Figure 5 shows a cross section along the section B-B, and<br>
Figure 6 shows a plan view of the cable connector.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective lower view of the cable connector 1<br>
without a lower housing part 2 (see figure 2). The cable<br>
connector 1 comprises an upper housing part 3, in which contact<br>
elements 4 can be inserted from below which are guided through<br>
corresponding guides in the housing part 3. The contact elements<br>
4 are of two-part design, a first contact part 5 comprising two<br>
fork contacts 6, 7 which are connected to one another via a U-<br>
shaped bend 8. In addition, a resilient contact arm 9 (which can<br>
be seen particularly well in figure 4) branches off upwards from<br>
the U-shaped bend. The second contact part 10 comprises an<br>
insulation displacement contact 11 (see figure 4) and a further<br>
resilient contact arm 12. The two resilient contact arms 9, 12<br>
then form an isolating contact (see figure 4). The two fork<br>
contacts 6, 7 are in this case aligned parallel to one another, the<br>
fork contact 7 however being moved upwards (in the direction of<br>
the upper housing part 3) and displaced parallel (away from the<br>
U-shaped bend 8). Furthermore, the cable connector 1 comprises<br>
a printed circuit board 13 on which a surge arrester 17 is<br>
arranged (see figure 2). Contact is in this case made with the<br>
printed circuit board 13 via the two fork contacts 7. However, in<br>
this case the fork contacts 6 remain freely accessible owing to the<br>
moved arrangement of the fork contacts 7 such that contact can<br>
be made with a further printed circuit board having functional<br>
elements (main board) via said fork contacts 6. The printed<br>
circuit board 13 also has a ground contact 14, by means of which<br>
a ground connection, for example via a mounting rack, can be<br>
produced. The upper housing part 3 is formed on the side faces<br><br>
with latching lugs 15 which serve the purpose of latching with the<br>
lower housing part 2, as is illustrated in figure 2. The housing<br>
part 3 also has latching openings 16 which serve the purpose of<br>
accommodating latching knobs of a plug (not illustrated). The<br>
lower housing part 2 likewise has latching lugs 18, by means of<br>
which the cable connector 1 can be latched with a further housing<br>
(not illustrated) which bears the main board.<br>
Figure 3 shows a side view of the cable connector 1, the cross<br>
sections along the section lines A-A and B-B being illustrated in<br>
figures 4 and 5, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates how the second<br>
contact part 10 is supported on a bearing 20 of the lower housing<br>
part 2, as a result of which the connection forces occurring are<br>
absorbed by the housing. It is also illustrated how the two<br>
resilient contact arms 9, 12 form an isolating contact 21.<br>
Provided in the upper housing part 3 is an insertion channel 22,<br>
in which an isolating plug or test plug (not illustrated) can be<br>
inserted which can be used to isolate the isolating contact 21. If<br>
the isolating plug or test plug is withdrawn again, the two contact<br>
arms 9, 12 spring back again and make contact with one another.<br>
Figure 6 shows a plan view of the cable connector 1 such that, in<br>
particular, the elongated insertion channel 22 can be seen as well<br>
as the rotation of the insulation displacement contacts 11 through<br>
45° towards the fork contacts 6, 7.<br><br>
