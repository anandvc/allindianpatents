				<td>DESCRIPTION POLYETHER POLYOL, RIGID POLYURETHANE FOAM AND PROCESSES FOR<br>
PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to polyether polyols obtained by dehydration condensation of glycerins, rigid polyurethanes obtained from reaction between the polyether polyols and polyisocyanates, and processes for the production thereof<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002]<br>
Polyether polyols are used as materials for rigid polyurethane foams  They are conventionally produced by a method of ring-opening polymerization of cyclic ether compounds such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or tetrahydrofuran with active hydrogen compounds as initiators  Because the cyclic ether compounds possess high activity, the reaction proceeds under relatively mild conditions  Further, the polyether polyols obtained by this process have narrow molecular weight distribution  However, the cyclic ether compounds have a low boiling point and high toxicity, and this makes the storage and<br><br>
handling thereof during the synthesis difficult [0003]<br>
With respect to polyether polyols obtained from the cyclic ether compounds, the average number of hydroxyl groups cannot be more than the number of active hydrogen atoms m the initiators because of the nature of the reaction  In some cases, the average number of hydroxyl groups can be reduced by side reactions during the reaction  Polyether polyols for rigid polyurethane foams require a large number of hydroxyl groups, and therefore the production thereof should involve hydroxyl-rich initiators such as pentaerythritol, sorbitol or sugars  However, the hydroxyl-rich initiators are frequently solid, and handling thereof as initiators is difficult [0004]<br>
On the other hand, polyether polyols may also be produced by dehydration condensation of alcohols  According to this method, the number of hydroxyl groups per polyether polyol molecule may be theoretically increased by using polyol compounds having three or more hydroxyl groups m the molecule as the alcohol  With respect to the polyether polyols obtained from dehydration condensation of polyol compounds having three of more hydroxyl groups in the molecule, JP-A-H02-172938 and JP-A-H07-216082 disclose polyglycenns obtained by dehydration condensation of glycerins in the presence of alkalis  When<br>
polyglycerins are used as polyol components for rigid polyurethane foams, the polyglycerins should have a high degree of condensation  However, the polyglycerins show very high viscosity when the degree of condensation is high  It is difficult to use such polyglycerins alone as polyol components for rigid polyurethane foams, and the polyglycerins should be mixed with other polyols to a polyglycerin concentration of 30 wt% or less (JP-A-2004-359891)<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION [0005]<br>
The present invention is aimed at solving the problems in the conventional art described above  It is an object of the invention to provide highly-functionalized, low-viscosity polyether polyols obtained by dehydration condensation of alcohols [0006]<br>
A polyether polyol according to the present invention is obtained by dehydration condensation of glycerin and monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol with the glycerin percentage being more<br>
than 50 mol% relative to 100 mol% of the total of the glycerin<br>
and alcohol<br>
[0007]<br>
Preferably, the polyether polyol has a hydroxyl value of 200 to 1200 mg KOH/g and a viscosity at 25°C of not more than 50000 mPa s, and has an average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule of not less than 3 [0008]<br>
The glycerin is preferably crude glycerin obtained by hydrolysis or alcoholysis of natural fat and oils [0009]<br>
A first process for producing polyether polyols according to the present invention comprises dehydration condensing glycerin and monohydric and/or dihydnc alcohol with the glycerin percentage being more than 50 mol% relative to 100 mol% of the total of the glycerin and alcohol [0010]<br>
A second process for producing polyether polyols according to the present invention comprises dehydration condensing glycerin to produce a condensate, and dehydration condensing the condensate and monohydric and/or dihydnc alcohol with the glycerin being used at a percentage of more than 50 mol% relative to 100 mol% of the total of the glycerin and alcohol [0011]<br>
The glycerin is preferably crude glycerin obtained by hydrolysis or alcoholysis of natural fat and oils [0012]<br>
A rigid polyurethane foam according to the present invention is obtained by reacting a polyol component comprising the polyether polyol and a polyisocyanate in the presence of a catalyst, a foaming agent and a foam stabilizer [0013]<br>
A process for producing rigid polyurethane foams according to the present invention comprises reacting a polyol component comprising the polyether polyol and a polyisocyanate in the presence of a catalyst, a foaming agent and a foam stabilizer<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION [0014]<br>
According to the present invention, polyether polyols having many hydroxyl groups and low viscosity may be easily obtained  The polyether polyols are useful as polyol components for rigid polyurethane foams  The rigid polyurethane foams obtained using the polyether polyols are useful as thermal insulating materials for building panels, refrigerators, freezers and pipes, and as structure support materials for houses and vehicles<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION [0015]<br>
The polyether polyols according to the present invention can be obtained by dehydration condensation of glycerin and monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol with the glycerin percentage being more than 50 mol% relative to 100 mol% of the total of the glycerin and alcohol  If glycerin alone is condensed to a degree of condensation such that it may be used as a polyol component for rigid polyurethane foams, the viscosity becomes so high that the glycerin cannot be used as a polyol component for rigid polyurethane foams  On the other hand, if the glycerin percentage is 50 mol% or less, a number of hydroxyl groups of the polyether polyols is so decreased and hence the obtainable rigid polyurethane foams have poor strength  The glycerin percentage is preferably in the range of more than 50 mol% to not more than 95 mol%, and more preferably 60 mol% to 90 mol% [0016]<br>
In the present invention, the glycerin is not necessarily refined glycerin, and crude glycerin obtained by hydrolysis or alcoholysis of natural fat and oils such as vegetable oil may be used and the purity thereof may be 95% or below as long as the final products such as rigid polyurethane foams reliably achieve desired properties According to the carbon neutral concept, the use of plant-derived crude glycerin leads to reduced<br>
emission of carbon dioxide which is released by combustion of the polyols and polyurethane foams manufactured using the crude glycerin Whether polymers are produced from biomass materials may be confirmed by measuring the content of 14C and the content of 12C/13C and determining the proportion of 14C (14C percentage) in accordance with ASTM D 6866 [0017]<br>
In detail, CO2 released from a burning sample is accurately guantified and is fed to an AMS (accelerated Mass Spectrometry) apparatus to determine the 14C content and the 12C/13C content, and the 14C percentage is compared to the 14C percentages found in air or petrochemicals to distinguish, as described in ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D 6866 04 (Standard Test Method for Determining the Biobased Content of Natural Range Materials Using Radiocarbon and Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry Analysis) [0018]<br>
Whether the polymers are of biomass origin or not may also be determined by absorbing C02 from a burning sample with a C02 absorbent, or converting CO2 into benzene, then determining the 14C content with a liquid scintillation counter, and comparing the 14C percentage thus obtained with the percentages found in petroleum products [0019]<br>
14C is not detected in polyols synthesized from petroleum-derived materials alone, and is detected in polyols from plant-origin materials  To achieve reduced carbon dioxide emission, the 14C percentage should be not less than 10 pMC (Percent Modern Carbon), preferably not less than 30 pMC, and more preferably 50 pMC [0020]<br>

The condensation reaction of the glycerin and monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol may be carried out using any reaction apparatus equipped with devices for distilling away the by-product water An exemplary reaction apparatus is connected with a distillation column at the top of the reaction apparatus and is connected with a condenser [0038]<br>
In the distillation column, the glycerin and monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol that are the starting materials, and by-produced water, low polymers and the like are distilled such that the necessary components such as the starting materials and low polymers are refluxed into the reaction apparatus and unnecessary components such as water are discharged into the condenser The number of theoretical plates of the distillation columns is not particularly limited, but it is generally 1 to 20 The packing materials in the distillation columns are not particularly limited, but raschig rings, berl saddles, McMahon<br>
packing, Canon packing, Stedman packing, Sulzer packing and Dixon packing may be generally used  The temperature of the distillation columns is not particularly limited and may be appropriately controlled using a cooling medium or a heating medium [0039]<br>
The condenser is used to condense water or by-produced low-boiling fractions The condensation is generally performed with use of a cooling medium The temperature of the cooling media is not particularly limited, but is generally m the range of about -30 to 60°C [0040]<br>
The reaction temperature in the dehydration condensation is not particularly limited as long as the dehydration condensation is induced at the temperature  The reaction temperature is preferably 160 to 280°C, and more preferably 200 to 260°C  The reaction pressure is not particularly limited, and the reaction may be carried out under any condition of normal pressure, reduced pressure or increased pressure as long as a large part of the glycerin and monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol will not be distilled away together with water [0041]<br>
The glycerin and the monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol may be mixed together at any time as  long as the percentage of<br>
the glycerin units in the reaction system is maintained above 50 mol%  For example, the glycerin and the monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol may be all at once added to the reaction apparatus and the condensation reaction may be initiated Alternatively, the glycerin alone may be placed into the reaction apparatus and condensed partially or completely, and the condensate may be further condensed with the monohydric and/or dihydric alcohol [0042] [Polyether polyols]<br>
By the processes as described hereinabove, there may be obtained polyether polyols that preferably have a hydroxyl value of 200 to 1200 mg KOH/g, more preferably 300 to 800 mg KOH/g, and a viscosity at 25°C of not more than 50000 mPa s  The polyether polyols are suitably used as polyol components for rigid polyurethane foams  If the hydroxyl value is below the lower limit, the glass transition temperature of rigid polyurethane foams is lowered and thus sufficient rigidity cannot be achieved in the rigid polyurethane foams  On the other hand, if the hydroxyl value exceeds the upper limit, the hydroxyl group concentration in the polyol component is excessively high and scorching may be caused by rapid heat generation m the production of rigid polyurethane foams  The viscosity m the above range permits foaming at from room temperature to 50°C<br>
in the production of rigid polyurethane foams [0043]<br>
The polyether polyols preferably have an average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule of not less than 3, whereby the degree of crosslinkmg in the rigid polyurethane foams is increased and the resin strength is enhanced [0044] [Monomer removal from polyether polyols]<br>
The polyether polyols obtained in the present invention may contain unreacted monohydric and/or dihydric alcohols Such unreacted monomers may be removed by known methods, for example by stripping under reduced pressure, prior to the production of rigid polyurethane foams [0045] [Purification of polyether polyols]<br>
