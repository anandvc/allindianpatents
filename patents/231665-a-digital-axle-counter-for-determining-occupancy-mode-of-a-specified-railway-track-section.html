				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a digital axle counter for determining<br>
occupancy mode of a specified railway track section. In particular,this invention relates to a digital counter to determine as to whether a particular section of a railway track is occupied by a train or clear and the direction of movement of the train, on the basis of which the next train is moved in the section.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
To ensure the safety of the movement of a rolling stock, it is necessary to determine as to whether the rolling stock is occupying a particular section of a railway track and the direction of movement of the rolling stock. For this purpose, the section of the railway track could be of any Length, such as 10 to 15 kilometres. Systems comprising axle detectors installed to rails and connected to an electronic junction box which is connected to an evaluator are known in the art to detect the occupation of a particular section of a railway track. The disadvantages associated with the known system are that the system is bulky, consumes considerable power, cable requirement is considerable. The detectors are installed to the rails and connected to the rails and connected to the junction box by means cable and therefore the system is not efficient.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a novel single section digital axle counter for detecting the occupation of a particular section of a railway track and the direction of movement of the roiling stock.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a single section digital axle counter which is no longer bulky.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a single section digital axle counter which does not consume substantial power.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a single requirement is less in comparison to that of the prior art.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a digital axle counter for determining occupancy mode of a specified railway track section including movement direction of an occupied train, in order to control rail traffic, comprising:<br>
- a first sensor (1) comprising a high frequency transmitter coil (TX) and a high frequency receiver coil (RX), the first sensor (1) being mounted on a web section of a rail (S) constituting the proximal end of the specified railway track section;<br>
a second sensor (2) comprising one each of identical transmitter coil and receiver coil disposed on a section of a rail constituting the distal end of the specified railway track section;<br>
the first sensor (1) and the second sensor (2) operably connected via optical cable respectively to two identical micro-controller electronic counting unit one each disposed at the proximal end and the distal end, the micro-controller based electronic counting units being interconnected via one of telecom cable, radio and optical cable, where in,<br>
the proximal end electronic counting unit (3) is operable the receive, register and store data in respect of the wheel counts when a train entering the proximal end of the specified track section<br>
the distal end electronic counting unit (3) is operable to receive, register and store data relating to the wheel count when the train leaving the distal end of the specified track section,<br>
the distal end electronic counting unit is further operable to receive data from the proximal end counting unit so as to compare the data and determine the occupancy mode of the specific track section including movement direction of the train.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the digital counter has axle detectors or sensors of high frequency and which are installed on the web of the rail. The sensors are connected to a mkro controller based evaluator provided for determining the occupancy of a section of railway track. Thus it is clear that the device of the present invention has high frequency sensors and the electronic junction box is not at all provided. Further, the evaluator provided in the device of the present invention is micro controller based.<br>
Thus the use of low frequency sensors, and electronic junction box and hardware based evaluator has been avoided to make the device of the present invention more efficient.<br>
A single section digital axle counter for use in railway track-side according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig.l shows the plan view of the device of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig.2 shows the front panel of the device of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig.3  shows block diagram of axle counter provided on<br>
one side of the track.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig.l the axle counter has a set of first sensor and second sensor 1 and 2 of high frequency provided at one end of a section of rail S and is connected to an evaluator unit 3. Each sensor 1 and 2 comprises a transmitter TX and a receiver RX respectively and which are adapted to be mounted on the web portion of the rail S. One set of sensors 1 and 2 is provided to determine the occupancy of the particular section of the railway track and the other set of sensors is provided to determine the direction of the movement of the rolling stock. The sensors SI and S2 is connected to a signal conditioners cards 3A of the evaluator unit 3 which is connected to a micro controller logic block 3B of the evaluator unit 3 A relay driver 3C is provided with said micro controller logic block 3B for operating a vital signal relay 3D which is provided to switching ON switching OFF the respective signalling means. A modem 4 is provided on the front panel of the device and as shown in fig.2 is connected with the micro controller logic block 3B for connecting the other unit having the same components as herein described above and provided at the other end of the rail section. The evaluator unit is provided to receive the signals from the sensors when the wheel of a rolling stock comes between the transmitter and receiver coils TX and RX of said sensors. A modulation of the carrier signal occurs for each wheel of the rolling stock. The modulation signal passes through amplifier and filters of the electronic evaluation unit and fed to micro controllers for a count of the pulses which is stored in memory and an identical electronic evaluation unit and sensors are provided at a distal location/other end of the section of railway track S and the stored pulses from the electronic evaluation unit of the proximal location are transmitted to the electronic unit of the distal location and vice versa.<br>
Specifically, the system consists of high frequency track side sensors fitted to the railway track at detection points. The sensors are energized from track-side electronic unit. The electronic unit consists of signal conditioner card, micro-controller card, relay driver card, modem and dc-dc converter. The two numbers of electronic units are required for monitoring one track section.<br>
The signal conditioner card is built with carrier signal generation circuits, input matching transformers, tuned filters, pulse shaper circuits. The card also consists of trolley protection circuits and noise rejection.<br>
The microcontroller are state of the art processor ICS including memory and peripheral ICs. The processors work and run external crystal clock and software. The date of wheel pulses entering at the detection points is received, validated and stored. The health of the system is also continuously monitored. The 2 out of 2 decision is arrived ok when wheels counted by both processors are agreed. The count information from these processors is sent through the modem card to the next detection point for comparison and track section clearance.<br>
The relay driver card assumes the function of driving 24v vital fail safe relay. When counts from both detection points are equal the relay is driven on for signaling to the trains.<br>
Modem card transmits the data of the counts stored in its detection to the next detection point via cable, OFC and radio. It also received the data from next detection point. These data are fed to microcontroller card. It: sends and receives the data in the form of packet information.<br>
DC-DC converter card generates the multiple dc supply voltages required for operation and working of the electronic cards.<br><br><br><br>
