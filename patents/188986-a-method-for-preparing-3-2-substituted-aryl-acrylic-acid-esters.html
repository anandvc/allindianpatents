The present invention relates to 3-(2-substituteci aryl)-acrylic acid esters, especially 3-(2-hydroxyaryl)-acrylic acid esters and 3-(2-aminoaryl)-acrylic acid esters. These compounds are useful as precursors for organoleptic compounds, especially for flavors, fragrances and masking agents, antimicrobial compounds and for fluorescent whitening agents.<br>
A principal strategy currently employed in imparting odour to consumer products is the admixing of the fragrance directly into the product. There are, however, several drawbacks to this strategy. The fragrance material can be too volatile and/or too soluble, resulting in fragrance loss during manufacturing, storage, and use. Many fragrance materials are also unstable over time. This again results in loss during storage.<br>
In many consumer products it is desirable for the fragrance to be released slowly over time. Micro encapsulation and inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins have been used to help decrease volatility, improve stability and provide slow-release properties. However, these methods are for a number of reasons often not successful. In addition, cyclodextrins can be too expensive.<br>
Fragrance precursors for scenting fabrics being washed in the presence of a lipase-containing detergent are described inwo 95/04809.  The  fragrance  precursors<br><br>
contained in the detergent and/or in the softener are cleaved by the lipase and a single active compound, either an odoriferous alcohol or aldehyde or ketene is yielded. Thereby a prolonged scenting effect on the fabric is obtained. The need for a lipase-containing detergent is limiting. In many parts of the world, detergents do not contain lipase. Other consumers prefer to use ^nuncio' detergents.<br>
Fluorescent whitening agents or brighteners have been added to laundry detergents since the 1950s to help maintain the original brightness of white clothing.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide new precursors for compounds with different activities and thus impart different activities to a product by the addition of just one compound. A further object of the invention is to provide new compounds which are stable under transport and storage conditions. A further object of the present invention is to provide precursor molecules supplying different active compounds simultaneously or successively.<br>
The present invention relates to 3-(2-substituted aryl)-acrylic acid esters of the formula I<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
A is a benzene or naphthalene ring,<br>
R^ is a saturated or unsaturated, straight, branched, salicylic or aromatic C10-C30 hydrocarbon residue which can contain heteroatom and can be substituted by an ionic substituent,<br>
R' in 2- or 3-position is hydrogen, a straight or branched Ci-Cs residue; an optionally substituted aromatic or optionally substituted heterocyclic residue,<br>
R^ and R"* stand for hydrogen, a straight or branched Ci-C;-alkyl or Ci-Cg alkoxy residue, a substituted or condensed heterocyclic residue, -OH, -NO2, -NK2, -N(Ci-C5 alkyl):, -M(hydroxyalkyl)2, -NHCO2CK3 or -MK(heterocycle),<br>
R", R' and R' may be the same or different,<br>
X stands for -OH or NHR^, v/herein R^ is hydrogen ^ saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched C1-C2C hydrocarbon or an optionally substituted aromatic 01 heterocyclic residue,<br><br>
and the acrylic double bond is of the E configuration.<br>
In the above formula I, all possible enantiomer and diastereomers and all mixtures are included within the scope of the invention.<br>
Compounds wherein R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched C10-C30 hydrocarbon residue containing one or more 0 and/or N atoms and/or C(0) groups and/or alkoxy groups or substituted by an ionic substituent of the formula NR53+, in which R5 is the residue of a fatty acid or an alkyl group with 1 to 30 carbon atoms are preferred.<br>
R2 is preferably a heterocyclic residue of the formula<br><br>
R3 and/or R4 are preferably hydrogen, -N(C1-C6 alkyl)2, -NH2, a five membered heterocyclic residue optionally containing N and/or 0 atoms, substituted by C1-C6 aliphatic and/or aromatic substituents.<br>
R1 may be the residue of an olfactory alcohol of the formula R1OH, the enol form of an olfactory aldehyde of the formula R1HO or of an olfactory ketone of formula R1O. R1 may also be an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl or<br><br>
arylalkyl residue carrying an 1-alkoxy, 1-aryloxy, or 1-arylalkoxy residue.<br>
The compounds of formula I are mostly or nearly odourless at room temperature, atmospheric conditions and about 20 to 100 % relative humidity. However, under activating conditions, they are cleaved. Thereby the residue of formula la<br><br>
yields a coumarin of the formula II<br><br>
wherein X1 stands for 0 or MR6 R2 R3, R4 have the meaning as defined above. The coumarins of formula II can have organoleptic and/or antimicrobial properties and/or optical brightening activity. Preferred are coumarins with olfactory properties. If R1 is the residue of an olfactory alcohol or of the enol form of an olfactory aldehyde or<br><br>
ketone, upon cleavage two active compounds with the above properties can be obtained. Thus, the compounds of formula I permit the development of useful consumer products with enhanced organoleptic and/or antimicrobial properties and/or optical brightening properties. The organoleptic coumarins and alcohols or aldehydes or ketones obtained are useful as fragrances, flavours, masking agents and antimicrobial agents.<br>
The  activating conditions which  lead to	cleavage and<br>
thereby to  the desired active  compounds	comprise the<br>
presence of UV light such as sunlight	and elevated<br>
temperatures.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
A is a benzene or naphthalene ring,<br>
R1 is hydrogen, unsaturated or saturated, straight or branched, alicyclic or aromatic C1-C30 hydrocarbon residue which can contain heteroatoms and can be substituted by an ionic substituent,<br><br>
R2 in 2- or 3-position is hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6 residue; an optionally substituted aromatic or optionally substituted heterocyclic residue,<br>
R3 and R4 stand for hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl or C1-C6 alkoxy residue, a substituted or condensed heterocyclic residue, -OH, -NO2, -NH2, -N(C1-C6 alkyl)2, -N(hydroxyalkyl)2, -NHCO2CH3 or -NH (heterocycle),<br>
R2, R3 and R4' may be the same or different,<br>
X stands for -OH or NHR6, wherein R6 is hydrogen a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched C1-C20 hydrocarbon or an optionally substituted aromatic or heterocyclic residue,<br>
and the acrylic double bond is of the E configuration,<br>
as precursors for organoleptic compounds, e.g. flavours, fragrances, odour masking agents and as precursors for antimicrobial agents and as precursors for fluorescent whitening agents.<br>
Preferred substituents are mentioned above.<br>
The esters of formula I can act as fragrance precursors in laundry products. They can also act as precursors for odour masking agents in the same products as the fragrance precursors. They also can act as precursors for antimicrobial agents. In addition, they can also act as<br><br>
precursors for fluorescent whitening agents. The fragrance precursors and the precursors for odour masking agents as well as the flavour precursors of the invention may be used individually in an amount effective to enhance or to mask the characteristic odour or flavour of a material. More commonly, however, the compounds are mixed with other fragrance or flavour components in an amount sufficient to provide the desired odour or flavour characteristics.<br>
The brightener precursors may be used also individually in an effective amount and mixed with one or more other brightener or colorant substance.<br>
Due to the in situ generation of the active compounds the desired effect is prolonged and the substantivity on .■ different substrates is enhanced. If two active compounds are provided by one ester of the formula I, they can be generated, depending on the precursor and/or the activating conditions, simultaneously or successively. Further, the precursors of the invention provide slow release of the active compounds.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method for preparing a 3-(2-substituted ary])-acryjic acid ester of the formula<br><br>
in which;<br>
A is a benzene or naphthalene ring,<br>
R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched, alicylic or •<br>
aromatic C10-C30 hydrocarbon residue which can contain heteroatoms<br>
and can be substituted by an ionic substituent of the formula NR53+ in<br>
which R5is the residue of a fatty acid or an alkyl group with 1 to 30<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
R2 in 2- or 3-position is hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6,<br>
residue; an aromatic or heterocyclic residue of the formula<br><br><br>
R3 and R4 stand for hydrogen, a straight or branched C1- C6 alkyl or<br>
C3-C6    alkoxy residue,  -OH,  -NO2,  -NH2,  -N(C1,-C6 alkyl )2,  -<br>
N(hydroxyalkyl)2,   -NHCO2CH3      or  -NH  (heterocycle),   a   five<br>
membered heterocyclic residue, substituted by C1-C6 aliphatic and/or<br>
aromatic substituents,<br>
R2,R3andR4 may be the same or different,<br>
X stands for -OH or NHR6, wherein R6 is hydrogen a saturated or<br>
unsaturated, straight or branched C1- C20 hydrocarbon ;<br>
and the acryUc double bond is of the E configuration;<br>
the said method comprising the steps of a transesterification or a<br>
Wittig reaction of a compound of formula<br><br>
in which R2 R3 and R4 are as defined above with a compound of formula R1OH, in which R1 is as defined above and recovering the 3-(2-substituted aryl)-acrylic acid ester of formula I by a known manner.<br>

The skilled person is, however, quite aware of those alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and coumarins which provide the desired<br><br>
organoleptic, e.g. fragrance, flavour and odour masking, antimicrobial and/or brightening effects.<br>
The compounds of formula I may preferably be used as sustained release odorants and flavours but also as sustained agents to mask or attenuate undesirable odours or to provide additional odours not initially present in consumer products, i.e. laundry detergents, fabric softeners, fabric softener sheets, toiletries and cosmetics such as sunscreens. Further applications are sustained brighteners and antimicrobial agents in the same products. The brighteners are especially useful for wool, rayon and polyamides. These compounds are also useful for flavouring and aromatizing tobacco products, e.g. cigarettes.<br>
The amount required to produce the desired, overall effect varies depending upon the particular compounds of formula I chosen, the product in which it will be used, and the particular effect desired.<br>
For example, depending upon the selection and concentration of the compound chosen, when a compound of the formula I is added either singly or as a mixture, e.g. to a laundry product composition at levels ranging from about 0.001 to about 10 % by weight, a coumarin and if desired an odoriferous alcohol or aldehyde or ketone in an organoleptically effective amount is released when the product is used. These newly formed odorant(s) serve to enhance  the odour of the fragrance.  Depending on the<br><br>
compound of formula I an antimicrobial agent or a brightener can be released.<br>
Depending upon the selection and concentration, addition of the compounds 1, either singly or as a mixture, to cigarette tobacco at levels ranging from about 5 ppm to about 50'000 ppm tends to enhance the smoking flavour and/or mask undesirable smoking odours. An important property of these compounds I is that the flavourant or odorant is covalently bound as a non-volatile compound and the flavourant or odorant is released only when the tobacco product is ignited and burns.<br>
Addition of the compounds of formula I either separately or as a mixture at levels suitably ranging from about 5 ppm to about 50'000 ppm by weight onto the media enclosing the tobacco serves to incorporate the odorant/flavourant in the side-stream smoke of the tobacco. Air borne flavourants and/or odorants are thus introduced. This newly formed odorant or flavourant serves to enhance or mask the smoking odours depending upon selection and use levels of the compounds I.<br>
As is evident from the above compilation of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and coumarins, a broad range of known odorants or flavours or mixtures can be generated from precursors of the invention. While manufacturing compositions the precursors of the invention may be used according to methods known to the perfumer, such as e.g. from W.A. Poucher, Perfumes, Cosmetics, Soaps, 2^, 7th Edition, Chapman and Hall, London 1974. The fluorescent whitening agents may be added in the same manner.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I can be prepared by using standard methods known to the skilled chemist. Convenient methods are outlined in the Examples without limiting the invention thereto.<br>
