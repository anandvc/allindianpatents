SALT OF (2S,3S)-3-[[(lS)-l-ISOBUTOXYMETEIYL-3-METHYLBUTYL] CARBAMOYL] OXIRANE-2-CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
[FIELD OF THE INVENTION]<br>
The present invention relates to a salt of (2S,3S)-3- [ [ (1S) -l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] -oxirane-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
[BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION]<br>
The below-illustrated sodium (2S,3S)-3-[ [ (1S)-1-iso-butoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] -oxirane-2-carboxyl-ate (hereinafter referred to as Compound A) shows a ca-thepsin-inhibitory action and is useful as a remedy for treating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis (Patent reference 1: WO 99/11640 pamphlet):<br><br>
Patent reference 1 describes a process for producing Compound A according to the following reaction scheme (see Example 48 of Patent reference 1):<br><br>
The starting ester material of the above-mentioned reaction scheme is generally purified by column chroma-tography to obtain a purified Compound A.<br>
[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br><br>
Amorphous Compound A is so hygroscopic and so ther¬mally unstable that various troubles in producing the remedy are expected, and is hence difficult to treat as material for the pharmaceutical preparation. According¬ly, there is a need to provide a thermally stable crys¬tal 1 ine (2S,3S)-3-[[{lS)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbu-tyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carboxylic acid salt having a long storage-life.<br>
If crystalline Compound A is prepared according to the conventional recrystallization or salt-making process in which Compound A is converted from a free form into the desired form, the product often precipitates in the form of too fine crystallites to filter or occasionally in the form of agar-like jelly.  Further, since Compound A is very hygroscopic, moisture in air causes to conver¬sion of Compound A from the crystal state into the amor¬phous state and, as a result, the filterability of the product lowers.<br>
In the industrial preparation of Compound A, puri¬fication by column chromatography is a troiiblesome proce¬dure. Accordingly, it is also desired to provide a sim¬ple purification process for Compound A.<br>
When Compound A is prepared in an industrial scale, it is important to purify Conpound A in the free acid form.  As described hereinafter, it is very simple and industrially advantageous to prepare Compound A in the free acid form from the after-described organic amine salt.  In addition, it makes the preparation process fur¬ther simple and advantageous that Compound A in an ester form is hydrolyzed with a basic sodium or potassium com¬pound to convert directly into a sodium or potassium salt.<br>
The present invention has an object to provide a thermally stable crystalline sodium or potassium (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl]-oxirane-2-carboxylate having a long storage-life. The<br><br>
invention also has objects to provide a simple and industrially advantageous process for preparing crystallites of the above-mentioned compound and to provide a salt of the compound with an organic amine employable in the process.<br>
The invention relates to crystalline sodium (2S,3S)-3-[[(lS)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]carbamoyl]-oxirane-2-carboxylate having the following characteristics:<br>
DSC: an exothermic peak observed at a temperature in the range of 170 to 175°C with weight decrease; and characteristic absorption bands of infrared absorption spectrum (KBr tablet) : 3255, 2950, 2860, 1670, 1630, 1550, 1460, 1435, 1395, 1365, 1310, 1260, 1110,890 cm"'.<br>
The invention also relates to crystalline potassium (2S,3S)-3-[[(lS)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carboxylate having the following characteristics:<br>
DSC: an exothermic peak observed at 177°C with weight decrease; and characteristic absorption bands of infrared absorption spectrum (KBr tablet): 3270, 3080, 2950, 2870, 1680, 1625, 1560, 1460, 1380, 1300, 1240, 1110, 895 cm"'.<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for preparation of crystalline<br>
sodium	or	potassium	(2S,3S)-3-[[(lS)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methyl-<br>
butyl]carbamoyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate, comprising the following steps (i) to (vi):<br>

[MOST PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION]<br>
The present invention is explained below in more de¬tail.<br>
Crystalline sodium or potassium (2S,3S)-3-[ [ (1S)-1-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carbox-ylate of the invention can be obtained according to the<br><br>
following flow chart. (Flow chart) Process 1:<br>
ester forro (A) - free form (B) - salt with an organ¬ic amine (C) - free form (D) - Na or K salt (E) - recrys-tallized product (F) - immediately dried crystallites (G);<br>
or otherwise Process 2:<br>
ester form (A) - Na or K salt (E) -^  recrystallized product (F) -* immediately dried crystallites (G) .<br>
Each step is explained below.<br>
(Process 1)<br>
(1) Step of ester form (A) - free form (B)<br>
In a mixed solvent of water and an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]carbamoyl]-oxirane-2-carboxylic ester (A) is hydrolyzed in the pres¬ence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and is then neutralized to obtain (2S,3S)-3-<br>
[ [ (1S)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid [free form (B)].<br>
In the above procedure, the starting (2S,3S)-3-<br>
[ [ (1S) -l-isobutoxyraethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carboxylic ester is an ester with an aliphatic alcohol, preferably an ester with a primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably an ester with ethanol, methanol, n-propyl alcohol or isopro¬pyl alcohol.<br>
For synthesizing the ester of the starting material,<br>
(2S,3S)-3-alkoxycabonyloxirane-2-carboxylic acid and<br>
(1S) -l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutylamine are, for exam¬ple, condensed according to the normal condensation pro¬cess (e.g., DCC-HOSu method, acid chloride method, and acid anhydride method).<br><br>
(2) Step of free form (B) - salt with an organic amine (C)<br>
The free form (B) prepared in Step (1) is caused to react with an organic amine in a solvent.  Examples of the solvents include aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol; aliphat¬ic ethers such as diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether; aliphatic esters such as ethyl acetate; aliphatic ketones such as acetone and ethyl methyl ketone; and water. They may be used singly or may be mixed.  In consideration of flammability and toxicity, the solvent preferably is ethyl acetate, acetone, water or a mixture thereof. Thus, the salt with a desired organic amine can be ob¬tained .<br>
The organic amine is, for example, represented by the formula of:<br>
(R2) (R2) (R3)N<br>
in which R2 is hydrogen or a linear-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms; R2 is hydrogen or a linear-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkyl or aralkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms; and R2 is a linear-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkyl group (including a crosslinked cyclic hydrocarbon group such as adamantyl) having 1 to 10 carbon atoms which may have a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen atoms, nitro, hydroxyl, carboxyl, guanidino, amino and aralkylamino groups; or otherwise R2 and R2 can be com¬bined to form a 5- to 7-membered ring comprising the ni¬trogen atom to which R2 and R2 are connected (the ring may contain additional nitrogen atom).  In consideration of cost, toxicity and crystallization, the organic amine preferably is piperazine, an adamantane amine, cyclohex-ylamine, dicyclohexylamine, tris (hydroxymethyl)aminometh-ane, arginine (preferably in L-form), lysine (preferably<br><br>
in D-form or DL-form) , benzathine or meglumine.  The salts with D- or DL-lysine, benzathine, meglumine and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane can be immediately used as medicaments without further processing.<br>
(3)	Step of salt with an organic amine (C) -* free form<br>
(D)<br>
The salt with an organic amine (C) obtained in Step (2) is treated with an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) in the conventional manner, to obtain (2S,3S)-3-[ [ (1S)-1-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carbox-ylic acid (D) of high purity.  Thus obtained free form (D) gave no peak attributed to cleavage products (9.8 minutes, see Example 14) while the peak is given by the free form or the metal salt thereof obtained by hydro-lyzing the ester form (A) purified by silica-gel column chromatography.<br>
(In the case of preparing a sodium salt)<br>
(4)	Step of free form (D) -&gt; Na salt (E)<br>
The free form (D) is converted into a sodium salt using a sodium source in an organic solvent capable of dissolving the free form (D) or in a water-containing or¬ganic solvent.  Examples of the sodium sources include sodium metal, sodium alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium organic carboxylate.<br>
The solvent preferably is a mixed solvent of water and methanol, ethanol or acetone, in consideration of flammability and toxicity.  If the water content is in the range of 1 to 5%, the product is obtained in a high yield.<br>
Thus obtained solid product is well filtered so that the product is collected by conventional filtration.<br>
(5)	Step of Na salt (E) - recrystallized product (F)<br><br>
The solid sodium salt (E) obtained in Step (4) is dissolved in an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol at a temperature of form room temperature to 60°C, and then an organic solvent is added to precipitate a crystalline product.  The organic solvent preferably is a mixed sol¬vent of ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol, in consider¬ation of flammability and toxicity.  If the mixing ratio of ethyl acetate/alcohol is in the range of 10/1 to 5/1, the product is obtained in a high yield.<br>
Thus recrystallized product (F) is well filtered so that the product is collected by conventional filtration.<br>
(6) Recrystallized product (F) -*  immediately dried crys¬tallites (G)<br>
The recrystallized product (F) is collected by fil¬tration in a stream of nitrogen gas, and immediately dried to obtain, in a high yield, crystalline sodium (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]carbamo¬yl] oxirane-2-carboxylate (G) of high purity having the following characteristics:<br>
DSC (the same as that in Example 15): exothermic peak observed in the range of 170 to 175°C with weight de¬crease / and<br>
characteristic absorption bands of infrared absorp¬tion spectrum (KBr tablet): 3255, 2950, 2860, 1670, 1630, 1550, 1460, 1435, 1395, 1365, 1310, 1260, 1110, 890 cm"^.<br>
The product preferably is in the form of white crys¬talline needles.<br>
The crystalline Na salt of the invention (described in Example 9) was subjected to a comparative stability test.  In the test, the Na salt was left at 80°C for three days together with both the substance obtained by con¬densing the solution to dryness and the product collected by filtration and left at room temperature after re-crystallization. As a result, it was found that the Na<br><br>
salt of the invention was superior to the substances for comparison in storage stability (see Exanple 15).<br>
(In the case of preparing a potassium salt)<br>
(7)	Step of free form (D) - K salt (E)<br>
The free form (D) is converted into a potassium salt using a potassium source in an organic solvent capable of dissolving the free form (D) or in a water-containing or¬ganic solvent. Examples of the potassium sources include potassium metal, potassium alkoxides such as potassium methoxide and potassium ethoxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and potassium organic carboxylate.<br>
The solvent preferably is a mixed solvent of water and methanol, ethanol or acetone, in consideration of flammability and toxicity.  If the water content is in the range of 1 to 5%, the product is obtained in a high yield.<br>
Thus obtained solid product is well filtered so that the product is collected by conventional filtration.<br>
(8)	Step of K salt (E) -*  recrystallized product (F)<br>
The solid potassium salt (E) obtained in Step (7) is dissolved in an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol at a temperature from room temperature to 60°C, and then an organic solvent is added to precipitate a crystalline product.  The organic solvent preferably is a mixed sol¬vent of ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol, in consider¬ation of flammability and toxicity.  If the mixing ratio of ethyl acetate/alcohol is in the range of 30/1 to lO/l, the product is obtained in a high yield.<br>
Thus recrystallized product (F) is well filtered so that the product is collected by conventional filtration.<br>
(9)	recrystallized product (F) - immediately dried crys¬<br>
tallites (G)<br>
The recrystallized product (F) is collected by fil-<br><br>
tration in a stream of nitrogen gas, and immediately dried to obtain, in a high yield, crystalline potassium (2S,3S) -3- [ [ (1S) -l-isobutoxyT\ethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamo¬yl] oxirane-2-carboxylate (G) of high purity having the following characteristics:<br>
DSC (the same as that in Example 15): exothermic peak observed at 177°C with weight decrease; and<br>
characteristic absorption bands of infrared absorp¬tion spectrum (KBr tablet): 3270, 3080, 2950, 2870, 1680, 1625, 1560, 1460, 1380, 1300, 1240, 1110, 895 cm'^<br>
The product is preferably in the form of white crys¬talline needles.<br>
The crystalline K salt of the invention (described in Example 11) was subjected to a stability test in which the K salt was left at 80°C for three days. As a result, it was found that the K salt of the invention was excel¬lent in storage stability (see Example 15).<br>
(In the case of preparing a calcium or lithium salt)<br>
Crystalline calcium or lithium (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-1-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carbox-ylate of high purity can be prepared in a high yield through the steps similar to the above-mentioned Steps (4) to (9) .<br>
(Process 2)<br>
(1) Ester form (A) - Na or K salt (E)<br>
[Preparation of Na salt (E)]<br>
The Na salt (E) can be obtained by causing the ester form (A) described in Step (1) of Process 1 react with a basic sodium compound (e.g., sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide) to hydrolyze, by condensing the reaction mix¬ture, and then by adding a water-conpatible organic sol¬vent such as acetone to crystallize the salt.  If the water content is in the range of 1 to 5%, the product is<br><br>
obtained in a high yield.<br>
[Preparation of K salt (E)]<br>
The K salt (E) can be obtained by causing the ester form (A) react with a basic potassium compound (e.g., potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide) to hydrolyze, by condensing the reaction mixture, and then by adding a water-compatible organic solvent such as acetone to crys¬tallize the salt.  If the water content is in the range of 1 to 5%, the product is obtained in a high yield.<br>
(2) Na or K salt (E) - recrystallized product (F) -* imme¬diately dried crystallites (G)<br>
The steps of Na salt (E)   recrystallized product (F) -*  immediately dried cirystallites (G) can be the same as Steps (5) and (6) of Process 1 described above.<br>
The steps of K salt (E)  recrystallized product (F)  immediately dried crystallites (G) can be the same as Steps (8) and (9) of Process 1 described above.<br>
As described above, the purification process in which (2S,3S)-3-[[(lS)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]-carbamoyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid is converted to a salt with an organic amine, as well as the process in which the ester form of (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-1-isobutoxy-methyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carboxylic acid is hydrolyzed with a basic sodium or potassium cotrpound to prepare directly a sodium or potassium (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-1-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]carbamoyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate, does not need to involve the step for purifying the ester form by silica-gel column chromatog¬raphy.  They are, therefore, simple and industrially advantageous processes for purifying (2S,3S)-3-[ [ (1S)-1-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-car¬boxylic acid.<br>
The crystalline sodium or potassium (2S,3S)-3-<br><br>
[ [ (1S) -l-isobutoxytnethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-carboxylate of the invention has a long storage life and excellent thermal stability, and accordingly is use¬ful as a material for pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Form thus obtained crystalline sodium or potassium<br>

[Exanple 1]  Preparation of free form (B)<br>
Crude ethyl (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]carbamoyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (164.54 g) synthesized according to the process described in Patent reference 1 was dissolved in ethanol (520 mL). While the solution was cooled with ice (at a temperature of 10°C or below), 1 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (522 mL) was dropped. After the solution was stirred for 1.5 hours while the tenperature was kept, ethanol was removed under reduced pressure. Water (340 mL) was added, and then the mixture was filtered through Celite to remove insoli±)le materials.  The mixture was washed twice with ethyl acetate (300 mL).  While the aqueous portion was cooled with ice, 6 mol/L aqueous hydrochloric acid (110 mL) was dropped to adjust the pH value to 1 and then the mixture was extracted twice with ethyl acetate (300 mL). The ethyl acetate portion was washed with water (300 mL) and with aqueous saturated sodium chloride solution (200<br><br>
mL) , and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.  The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to ob¬tain (2S,3S)-3-[[(1S)-l-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl]-carbamoyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid (139.61 g, 93.1%) as orange oil.  The NMR data were the same as those in Exam¬ple 6.<br>

[Exarnple  15]     Comparative stability test<br>
(Procedure)<br>
As a sample, 10 mg of sodium or potassium (2S,3S)-3-<br>
[ [ (1S) -1 - i sobutoxymethyl - 3 -methylbutyl ] carbamoyl ] oxirane -2-carboxylate was weighed and placed in a test tube. After the sample was kept in a thermostat at 80°C for three days under a light-shaded and airtight condition, the amount of remaining substance was measured by HPLC.<br>
(HPLC conditions)<br>
The same as those in Example 14.<br>
(Conditions of DSC: differential scanning calorimetiry)<br>
Each of the sodium or potassium (2S,3S)-3-[ [ (1S)-1-isobutoxymethyl-3-methylbutyl] carbamoyl] oxirane-2-car-boxylate (sample) and 0.01 g of a-alumina (standard) was placed in a container, and heated at temperatures elevat¬ing from room temperature to approx. 200°C at the heating rate of 2°C/minute.  (A differential scanning calorimetric thermobalance [TASIOO, TG-DCS type, Rigaku Corporation] was used.)<br>
(Results)<br>
The results are set forth in Table 1.<br><br><br>
1)	obtained by condensation to dryness;<br>
2)	recrystallized and collected by filtration, and then left at room temperature; and<br>
3)	presumed to be more in amorphous state than in crystal state.<br>
The results in Table 1 clearly indicate that the crystalline Na salt prepared in Example 9 (in which the salt was recrystallized, collected by filtration in a stream of nitrogen gas and immediately dried) was superi¬or in storage stability to the salt obtained by condensa¬tion to dryness (according to the conventional process) or obtained through recrystallization and drying in air. Further, the results in Table 1 indicate that the crys¬talline K salt prepared in Example 11 also had excellent storage stability.<br><br><br>
