COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
          PROCESS     FOR     THE     PREPARATION     OF     SPIRO     [(4-     CYCLOHEXANONE)-[3H]INDOL]-2'[l'H]-ONE DERIVATIVES"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO,   pf   174,   Avenue   de   France,   F-75013   Paris,<br>
France,	<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of spiro[(4-cyclohexanone)-[3H]indo]-2' [l'H]-one derivatives.<br>
Spiro[(4-cyclohexanone)-[3H]indol-2'[lH]-one and dispiro[(l,3-dioxolan)-2,4'-cyclohexane-[3H]indol]-2"[lH]-one derivatives are important intermediates to the vasopressine V2 antagonistic compound, SR 121463. For example, as described in patentapplication WO9715556 the dispiro[(l,3~dioxolan)~2,4'-cyciohexane-l,3"-(5"-ethoxy)-[3H]indol]-2"[lH]-one (compound of formula VII)<br><br>
H     •	.<br>
can be prepared by reacting 4-ethoxyphenylhydrazine with 4-(l,3-<br>
dioxolan)cyclohexane-carboxylate sodium salt followed by cyclization of the<br>
resulting	1 -(4 '-ethoxyphenyl)-2-(4"-/l ,3~dioxolan/-cyclohexane-carbonyl)-<br>
hydrazine.<br>
  According to another synthetic route (EP 636608) the compound of formula VII is obtained by oxidation of the spiro[(4-hydroxy-cyclohexane)-l,3'(5'-ethoxy)-[3H]indol-2'[1H]-one to the appropriate cyclohexanone derivative, from which the ketale of the formula VII is prepared by reaction with ethylene glycol.<br>
Disadvantages of both of the above syntheses are the toxic starting materials, many-step syntheses, low yields of some synthetic steps, expensive reagents and extreme reaction conditions in certain reactions.<br>
To our surprise, we have found that in contrast to the analogous reaction described in the literature (Annalen 1941, 548, 117-146; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953, 75, 5301-5305; L Chem. Soc. C, 1970, 796-800, J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 2459-2469) the addition   of methyl   or   ethyl   acrylate   to   5-ethoxy-indolinone,   followed   by<br><br><br><br>
00000008 <br>
Dieckmann-condensation, hydrolysis and decarboxylation does not lead to a homogeneous product, that is why the procedures described in the literature above are not suitable for industrial synthesis. We have found that the hydrogen in position-1 of the 5-ethoxy-indolinone has to be substituted by an appropriate protective group, if we want the subsequent reactions to proceed in the desired direction.<br>
In the case the substituent in position-1 is a phenyl group as described in USP 3395156 side reactions cannot be avoided. Before the Dieckmann-condensation the l|0     obtained l-phenyloxindole-3,3-dipropionic acid ester has to be hydrolyzed and reesterified to get a pure starting material.<br>
The subject of our invention is a process for the preparation of spiro[(4-cyclohexanone)-[3H]indol]-2' [l'H]-one derivatives of the general formula I<br><br><br>
