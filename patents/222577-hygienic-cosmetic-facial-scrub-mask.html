FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of hygienic/cosmetic facial scrub/mask and its preparation for moisturizing the skin and decreasing established acne and in some cases a prevention of acne and removal of makeup and dirt, and protects the skin from bacteria and contaminants comprising substances of natural origin.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
During their lifetimes, most people experience undesirable facial skin conditions, such as acne, often beginning at pre-adolescenee. Dry skin, loss of firmness and elasticity accompanies the aging process. Women, in particular, turn to cosmetic treatments for enhancing the appearance of the skin, however, men can also benefit from this procedure. This has been a multi billion business now-a-days and growing tremendously. The need of the hour is further research and development in this field and to come out with an invention for skin treatment that would be easy to use, economically benefit having no side effects.<br>
Skin care systems using masks are not a new idea as exemplified by the following patents: U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,593, to Swanbeck, issued Apr. 23, 1974. This invention is limited to treatment of skin problems, especially acne. U.S. Pat. No. 4,634,436, to La Tour, issued Jan. 6,1987 provided temporary relief fromaffliction. U.S. Pat.

Furthermore the objective of the invention is to devise a process for preparation of a facial/skin scrub/mask from the sources of natural origin.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Facial scrub/mask is prepared taking the ingredients multani matti, sandal wood powder, rose water, aloe vera extracts, caster oil and glycerine in varying weight percentage. The scrub/mask is prepared in a defined process involving mixing intimately the ingredients sequentially and adding balanced water to make the composition a dough type. Finally, shaping the mould and drying to obtain the soap in different shapes. The beneficial effect of using this soap is confirmed by applying to a panel of women for a specific duration in a specific way.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Multani matti is an excellent skin tone and astringent. Reduce oiliness and while nourishing the skin, keeps it soft and sparkling, helps in the removal of blemishes, impurities and grime. Improves complexion by facilitating better blood circulation. This can be used in daily bath as body pack for glowing health. The raw form of the multani matti was ground to fine powder and was subject to sieving. Particle size of -150|xm to +50|im were used for the composition for facial scrub/mask of the present invention.<br>
Sandalwood is a relaxant with sensual properties. With a fragrance described as rich, sweet, fragrant yet delicate, woody and warm, sandalwood promotes a feeling of well-being. The sandal tree grows mainly in south India, and is used not only for medicinal purposes, but also as a perfume because of<br>
3<br><br>
its aromatic property. Sandalwood is good for all skin types, in particular dry and oily skin and acne. Even as it has moisturizing properties, it is a mild astringent and antiseptic. Its main component santalol (~90%) has antimicrobal property. Sandalwood is also soothing for cracked, chapped and irritated skin. It is also recommended for mature and tired skin as well as stretch marks and scars. Sandalwood paste is found to be effective as an effective remedy for prickly heat. The paste applied prevents excessive sweating and heals inflamed skin. Having these properties it is chosen as a component for the facial scrub/mask of the present invention. The raw wood is ground into fine powder and sieved and particle size of -150 µm to +50 µm were used for the composition for facial scrub/mask.<br>
Rose water is one of the all-time best and most traditional facial cleansers, because rose is astringent, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and has a lovely scent. Pure Rose Water is considered an excellent facial toner, especially for dry or sensitive skin. The water is prepared as follows: 1 cup rose-infused water, 2 teaspoons glycerin, 5 to 10 drops rose essential oil. Placed a handful of dried rose petals in a mason jar, covered with boiling water, seal, and let set overnight. After the rose petal infusion has set overnight, strain. Combine the ingredients in a pretty jar, and shaked to blend. The antiseptic quality of essential oils also acts as a preservative. The enhanced property of rose water makes a good choice as an ingredient in facial scrub/mask. The final form of the rose water as obtained is taken as an ingredient for the present invention.<br>
Aloe vera, a tropical or subtropical plant of the genus Aloe, has lance-shaped leaves with jagged edges and sharp points. The leaves contain a viscous but essentially clear gel given structural rigidity by hair-like connected fibers that run through it. Freshly excised from the plant and applied in vitro, this gel has been used medicinally for centuries by those living where the plant normally grows to relieve the pain of plant and animal stings, such as jellyfish stings. Aloe Vera uses in all cosmetic industries (Aloe vera is very important ingredients in all cosmetics like powder, facial cream, shampoo, oil etc.), medical industries, food processing industries and etc. The gel of the aloe vera plant has been known to have healing powers for centuries. Practically everybody is aware of aloe vera gel for treating burns, skin inflammation etc. In higher concentrations, (60 to 90 %) aloe vera extracts can eliminate dozens of harmful bacteria.<br>
Aloe vera gel product is produced by mechanically separating the aloe vera gel matrix from the outer cortex of the aloe vera leaf and, after filtering particles of the aloe vera leaf from the gel matrix, the extracted gel is then mixed in a suitable vessel equipped for temperature control and heated to the range of from about 30.degree. C. to about 70.degree. C. When the gel reaches this range, ascorbic acid is added to compensate for the loss due to oxidation and exposure to air; while maintaining temperature and continuing mixing, other ingredients can be added to stabilize the color, stabilize the<br>
oxidant, and to adjust pH, as well as surfactants. The hot gel is admixed for a sufficient period of time<br>
4<br><br>
so that it is thoroughly admixed and bacteria is killed. The hot gel is immediately passed to a heat exchanger where the temperature is dropped to ambient temperature or below (25.degree. C. or below) within about one hour. The gel once cooled to ambient temperature is then ready for storage at room temperature and will exhibit an increased shelf life. The gel so obtained is ready for use in the facial scrub composition of the present invention.<br>
Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained from the castor bean (or preferably castor seed as the castor plant, Ricinus communis, is not a member of the bean family). Castor oil has an unusual composition and chemistry, which makes it quite valuable. About 1 % of global castor oil production goes into medical or health store products. It is used to ease constipation and as an emetic to induce vomiting. Castor Oil is regarded as one of the most valuable laxatives in medicine. Caster oil used in the present invention is extracted in the conventional manner.<br>
Glycerine is a clear, colourless liquid with a slightly sweet taste. Glycerine is used as an ingredient in cosmetics, medicines, toothpaste, esters, liquid soaps, tobacco products, and food products. It is also used extensively as an intermediate in the production of polyester, polyurethane, and alkyd resin formulations. In cosmetics, glycerine is a favorite in keeping the skin soft and is used in body and shaving creams. It is the basic material in which toothpaste is formed and preserves the desired smoothness and viscosity of the paste. Glycerine is used in cough medicines and anesthetics, for ear treatments, and in bacteriological media. Glycerine available in the market was used as such for the present invention. The main purpose of using glycerine in the composition is to produce a desired smoothness and making skin soft.<br>
The potential beneficial effect and versatile use of each components described above made it possible<br>
to think for a novel composition which behaves synergistkalry for use as a facial scrub/mask.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that a very specific combination of each of the components showed a<br>
promising effect once applied as facial scrub. The results obtained applying the scrub/mask is far<br>
more better than other products available for the same purpose. It is the synergistic effect of all the<br>
individual components that impart such an effect o the skin. The composition of the invention in the<br>
form of a soap is prepared following a well defined process given below varying the weight<br>
percentage the components. Each varying composition is tested for its effect on to the skin to assess<br>
the best formulation. The following examples are outlined taking different components in different<br>
weight percentage and their effect is observed. Table 1 gives a comprehensive out look of different<br>
compositions in varying weight percentage of different components of the scrub/mask containing<br>
examples (1-5). Compositions of examples (1-5) are prepared in a specific process is described as<br>
follows. Sandalwood powders described before is added to multani matti of the specific particle size<br>
and mixed thoroughly. Then glycerine and caster oil is added to the above mixture and mixed<br>
intimately. Finally, rose water and aloe vera extract is added to the above mixture and required<br>
5<br><br>
amount of water is added carefully with stirring to avoid curdling of the mixture. The dough so formed is moulded into different shape and left for dry for two days. The shaped materials so obtained in the form of a soap is packed and are ready for use.<br>

The final products obtained from almost all examples showed excellent mechanical properties and is very smooth for use.<br>
To assess the respect of the composition formed in Example (1-5) and its advantage over the control a study was conducted comprising a panel of complications women of 10 each. First panel of 10 women having such problems were advised to use the soap of example 1, 2nd panel women of example 2, 3rd panel women of example 3, 4* panel women of example 4, 5th panel women of example 5 and 6th panel women of a control, respectively. All were instructed to use the soap supplied with water only onto the facial portion for 15 days continuously once a day before bath. They were also advised to rub gently the face for 10 minutes along with the soap and water. After 15 days an indexing was made on the results obtained on the basis of the satisfaction after and % removal of complications. A score of 100 is allotted to those who were fully satisfied and observed full removal of complications. With respect to this score 100, panels were classified and different score was allotted.<br>

	PRODUCTS USED	INDEX NO.<br>
Panel -1	Example -1	75<br>
Panel - 2	Example - 2	85<br>
Panel - 3	Example - 3	100<br>
Panel - 4	Example - 4	70<br>
Panel - 5	Example - 5	80<br>
Panel - 6	Control	65<br>
From the forgoing it is observed that Panel - 3 using product of Example - 3 were most satisfied with the results and obtained maximum benefit.<br>
The component of Example - 3 was giving the most effect result due to the synergistic composition among the components. But the spirit of the invention is not limited to the wt % of components of Example - 3 only rather it covers all the examples and the wt % of different components in these. However, for further commercial exploitation, Example - 3 was practised.<br>
BENEFITS FROM USING THERAPEUTIC SKIN TREATMENT<br>
1.	Improved skin tone<br>
2.	Immediately noticeable improvement in skin texture<br>
3.	Removal of excess oils<br>
4.	Skin sloughing treatment performed<br>
5.	Acne dried and healed<br>
6.	Skin moisturized<br>
7.	Aging skin rejuvenated<br>
In addition, using a facial mask with the preparation helps to keep the compound on the surface of the skin. This allows the skin to draw from a reservoir during the sleeping hours-giving the face the moisture it needs. The mask also protects skin from contaminants and bacteria in the environment which clog pores that cause acne. The mask conforms to the contour of the face, is easy to use and allows for ease of movement.<br>
