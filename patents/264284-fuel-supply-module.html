				<td>DESCRIPTION FUEL SUPPLY MODULE TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention nnainly relates to a fuel supply module for supplying fuel to an engine fuel injection valve and, in particular, relates to an improvement of a fuel supply module that includes a mounting base member mounted on a ceiling wall of a fuel tank and having a fuel takeoff pipe projecting from an upper face, an electric pump supported by the mounting base member, housed within the fuel tank, pumping up fuel within the fuel tank, and sending the fuel to the fuel takeoff pipe, and a regulator valve for returning into the fuel tank part of the fuel discharged from the electric pump so as to regulate the discharge pressure, the fuel supply module having a coupler, for retaining an outside terminal, projectingly provided integrally with the upper face of the mounting base member, and having an inside terminal and a power-supplying terminal connected to each other via a lead wire, the inside terminal being connected to the outside terminal and projecting from a lower face of the mounting base member, and the power-supplying terminal being projectingly provided on an upper face of the electric pump. BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Such a fuel supply module is already known, as disclosed in Patent Publication 1.<br>
Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-77122 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] In such a conventional fuel supply module, since the inside terminal projectingly provided on the lower face of the mounting base is disposed substantially immediately above the power-supplying terminal projectingly provided on the upper face of the electric pump, it is necessary to make a working space between the two terminals in the vertical direction for connecting the lead wire, and since the regulator valve is disposed on one side of a longitudinal fuel passage<br>
1<br><br>
extending downward of the mounting base member and connected to a fuel discharge pipe of the electric pump, it is necessary to form the longitudinal fuel passage so that it is long, and for these reasons the mounting base member and the electric pump are prevented from being disposed close to each other, thereby hindering attempts to design a compact fuel supply module. [0004] The present invention has been accomplished under such circumstances, and it is an object thereof to enable a mounting base member and an electric pump to be disposed close to each other, thus providing a compact fuel supply module. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0005] To accomplish the above object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fuel supply module comprising a mounting base member mounted on a ceiling wall of a fuel tank and having a fuel takeoff pipe projecting from an upper face, an electric pump supported by the mounting base member, housed within the fuel tank, pumping up fuel within the fuel tank, and sending the fuel to the fuel takeoff pipe, and a regulator valve for returning into the fuel tank part of the fuel discharged from the electric pump so as to regulate the discharge pressure thereof, the fuel supply module having a coupler, for retaining an outside terminal, projectingly provided Integrally with the upper face of the mounting base member, and having an inside terminal and a power-supplying terminal connected to each other via a lead wire, the inside terminal being connected to the outside terminal and projecting from a lower face of the mounting base member, and the power-supplying terminal being projectingly provided on an upper face of the electric pump, characterized in that the mounting base member has integrally formed therewith a connection tube having a fuel discharge pipe of the electric pump fitted thereinto from below and providing communication between the fuel discharge pipe and the fuel takeoff pipe, the inside terminal is disposed radially outward of the electric pump, the regulator valve is mounted on the mounting base member between the inside terminal and the connection tube, and the mounting base<br>
2<br><br>
11<br>
member has formed therein a pressure regulation path providing a connection between a valve hole of the regulator valve and the fuel takeoff pipe. [0006] According to a second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect, the fuel discharge pipe and the power-supplying terminal, which are projectingly provided on an upper end face of the electric pump, are disposed on opposite sides of and sandwiching an axis of the electric pump, and the regulator valve is disposed immediately above the power-supplying terminal. [0007] According to a third aspect of the present invention, in addition to the second aspect, the regulator valve is disposed so that at least part thereof is above the upper face of the mounting base member.<br>
[0008] According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, in addition to any one of the first to third aspects, the fuel takeoff pipe and the coupler are disposed on the same diameter when looking at a plane of the mounting base member and have openings that face outward in diametrically opposite directions from each other, while a retaining hole formed in the lower face of the mounting base member and into which the regulator valve is fitted and retained, a guide tube similarly formed on the lower face of the mounting base member and surrounding the inside terminal, and the connection tube are disposed so that axes thereof are parallel to one another.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, since the inside terminal of the mounting base member is disposed radially outward of the electric pump, it is possible to connect the lead wire to the inside terminal and the power-supplying terminal without providing a working space between the inside terminal and the power-supplying terminal in the vertical direction for connecting the lead wire. Moreover, in the mounting base member, since a wide space between the inside terminal disposed radially outward of the electric pump and the connection tube connected to the fuel discharge pipe of the electric pump is utilized for installing the regulator valve, the space efficiency improves, and this regulator valve does not<br><br>
prevent the electric pump being disposed close to the mounting base member. It is thereby possible for the mounting base member and the electric pump to be disposed close to each other, and for the fuel supply module to be made compact. [0010] In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, the three, that is, the fuel discharge pipe, the power-supplying terminal, and the regulator valve can be efficiently disposed in a concentrated manner above the electric pump, which is effective in making the fuel supply module compact.<br>
[0011] Moreover, since fuel discharged from the regulator valve drops around the power-supplying terminal, the area around the power-supplying terminal is continuously washed by fuel discharged from the regulator valve, the fuel does not remain around the power-supplying terminal, and it is thereby possible to prevent corrosion of the power-supplying terminal due to moisture contained in fuel that has remained there.<br>
[0012] In accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, when the , mounting base member and the electric pump are disposed close to each other, it is possible to more reliably avoid interference from the regulator valve. [0013] In accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, it is possible to form, using a relatively small number of molds, the mounting base member including the fuel takeoff pipe, the coupler, the regulator valve mounting hole, the inside terminal guide tube, and the connection tube for the fuel discharge pipe.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] A mode for carrying out the present invention is explained below by reference<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in the attached drawings.<br>
EMBODIMENT 1<br>
[0017] First, in FIG. 1 to FIG. 3, a fuel supply module M of the present invention is<br>
mounted on a ceiling wall 1 of a fuel tank T mounted in a vehicle such as a<br>
motorcycle, the fuel supply module M supplying fuel within the fuel tank T to an<br>
engine fuel injection valve I.<br>
[0018] The fuel supply module M includes a mounting base member 2, an electric<br>
pump Ep, an upper pump holder 3A, a lower pump holder 3B, and a fuel strainer 4,<br><br>
the electric pump Ep being disposed immediately beneath the mounting base member 2 with its axial direction vertical, the upper pump holder 3A being formed integrally with the mounting base member 2, the lower pump holder 3B being detachably joined to the upper pump holder 3A and housing and retaining the electric pump Ep in cooperation with the mounting base member 2, and the fuel strainer 4 being mounted at the lower end of the electric pump Ep. [0019] The ceiling wall 1 of the fuel tank T is provided with an opening 5 through which the electric pump Ep is inserted into the interior of the fuel tank T, and is fixedly provided with a mounting ring 6 that surrounds the opening 5. This mounting ring 6 is fixedly provided with a plurality of mounting bolts 7 projecting from an upper face thereof.<br>
[0020] The mounting base member 2 has a disk-shaped flange portion 2a superimposed on the upper face of the mounting ring 6 so as to block the opening 5. This flange portion 2a is provided with a plurality of bolt holes 11 arranged along the outer periphery thereof, and the mounting base member 2 is fixed to the mounting ring 6 via the plurality of mounting bolts 7 inserted through these bolt holes 11 and a plurality of nuts 8 screwed and tightened on the mounting bolts 7. In this arrangement, an annular seal 9 for sealing the opening 5 is disposed between the flange portion 2a and the ceiling wall 1 of the fuel tank T.<br>
[0021] This mounting base member 2 is made of a synthetic resin; a fuel takeoff pipe 12 projecting horizontally outside the fuel tank T is formed integrally with an upper part of the flange portion 2a, and an outer end part of the fuel takeoff pipe 12 is connected to a fuel supply pipe 33 communicating with the engine fuel injection valve I.<br>
[0022] The upper pump holder 3A is formed integrally with a lower face of the flange portion 2a. This upper pump holder 3A projects into the interior of the fuel tank T, has a cylindrical shape so that it fits onto the outer periphery of an upper half of the electric pump Ep, and is provided with a plurality of T-shaped latching grooves 13F opening at the lower end and spaced at equal intervals in the peripheral direction.<br><br>
[0023] On the other hand, the lower pump holder 3B is made of a synthetic resin In a cylindrical shape so as to house and retain a lower half of the electric pump Ep. In this arrangement, a plurality of T-shaped latching tabs 13M projecting from the upper end of the lower pump holder 3B are integrally formed therewith. Engaging these latching tabs 13M with the latching grooves 13F joins the upper pump holder 3A to the lower pump holder 3B. The electric pump Ep is thus housed and retained between the upper pump holder 3A and the lower pump holder 3B. [0024] As is clearly shown In FIG. 2, the electric pump Ep is formed from an electric motor E having a rotor 20 facing In the vertical direction, and a fuel pump P driven by the electric motor E. The electric motor E is formed from a cylindrical stator 17 having a plurality of magnets 17a fixedly arranged on the inner periphery in the peripheral direction, an upper bearing bracket 18 joined to the upper end of the stator 17 by crimping, a lower bearing bracket 19 joined to a lower end part of the stator 17, and the rotor 20, which has a rotor shaft 20a supported by the upper and lower bearing brackets 18 and 19.<br>
[0025] The fuel pump P is arranged as a Wesco type from a pump case 23 and a pump impeller 24, the pump case 23, together with the lower bearing bracket 19, being joined to the stator 17 by crimping so as to form a pump chamber 22 between itself and a lower face of the lower bearing bracket 19, and the pump impeller 24 being rotatably housed in the pump chamber 22 and connected to a lower end part of the rotor shaft 20a.<br>
[0026] The pump case 23 is provided with a suction port 25 opening In the pump chamber 22, the fuel strainer 4, which Is disposed In a bottom part within the fuel tank T, Is connected to this suction port 25, and this fuel strainer 4 is mounted on a support shaft 26 projectingly provided on a lower face of the pump case 23. The lower bearing bracket 19 is provided with a discharge port 27 providing communication between the pump chamber 22 and the interior of the stator 17. [0027] Formed integrally with the upper bearing bracket 18 is a fuel discharge pipe 30 projecting thereabove and having a final discharge port 34 communicating with<br><br>
the interior of the stator 17, and provided in the interior of the fuel discharge pipe 30 is a check valve 31 for preventing backflow of fuel into the final discharge port 34. This fuel discharge pipe 30 is fitted from below, via a seal 32, into the inner periphery of a connection tube 29 projectingly provided integrally with a lower face of the mounting base member 2.<br>
[0028] Formed in the mounting base member 2 are a series of fuel passages 28 in an L shape running through the interior of the fuel takeoff pipe 12 and the interior of the connection tube 29 and communicating with the interior of the fuel discharge pipe 30, and a pressure regulation path 35 branching from a bent portion of the fuel passage 28 and having its downstream end opening within the fuel tank T. The pressure regulation path 35 is formed from a pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a formed as an extension of the fuel passage 28 on the fuel takeoff pipe 12 side, and a pressure regulation path downstream portion 35b bending downward from the downstream end of the pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a and having its downstream end opening within the fuel tank T. The pressure regulation path downstream portion 35b is provided with a regulator valve R for regulating the pressure of the interior of the fuel passage 28 so that it is at a predetermined pressure suitable for fuel injection from the fuel injection valve I. [0029] This regulator valve R includes a bottomed cylindrical valve housing 36 formed separately from the mounting base member 2, and the valve housing 36 has in an end wall a valve hole 37 running therethrough and a conical valve seat 38 connected to the inner end of the valve hole 37. A valve chamber 42 within the valve housing 36 houses a ball type valve body 39 that can be seated on the valve seat 38, a pressure-regulating spring 40 for urging the valve body 39 with a predetermined set load in a direction that seats it on the valve seat 38, and an annular retainer 41 supporting a fixed end of the pressure-regulating spring 40. This retainer 41 is press-fitted and fixed into the inner periphery of the valve chamber 42 and retained by a retaining ring 46 to prevent it from falling out, the retaining ring 46 being latched to an opening of the valve chamber 42.<br><br>
[0030] The valve housing 36 is fitted into and secured, with the valve hole 37 upward, to a retaining hole 43 opening on the lower face of the mounting base member 2, and the valve hole 37 communicates with the pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a via a though hole 44 provided in the ceiling wall of the retaining hole 43. The though hole 44, the valve hole 37, and the valve chamber 42 thus form the pressure regulation path downstream portion 35b.<br>
[0031] Furthermore, formed in the mounting base member 2 is a pouch-shaped recess 45 branching from the pressure regulation path 35 on the upstream of the regulator valve R. In the illustrated example, the pouch-shaped recess 45 is disposed on the downstream end of an extension of the pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a and, therefore, when the mounting base member 2 is molded, the fuel passage 28 within the fuel takeoff pipe 12, the pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a, and the pouch-shaped recess 45 can be formed by means of one common core.<br>
[0032] The fuel discharge pipe 30 is disposed on one side of an upper end face of the upper bearing bracket 18, and a power-supplying terminal 47 of the electric motor E is projectingly provided on the other side.<br>
[0033] A coupler 48 for retaining an outside terminal 49 is formed integrally with an upper face of the mounting base member 2, an inside terminal 52 connected to the outside terminal 49 projects from the lower face of the mounting base member 2, and a cylindrical guide tube 53 surrounding the inside terminal 52 is projectingly provided integrally with the lower face of the mounting base member 2. Connectors 50a and 50b attached to opposite ends of a lead wire 50 are connected to the power-supplying terminal 47 and the inside terminal 52 respectively, thereby providing electrical connection between the inside terminal 52 and the power-supplying terminal 47.<br>
[0034] In the above arrangement, the fuel discharge pipe 30 and the power-supplying terminal 47 on an upper face of the electric pump Ep are disposed on opposite sides relative to an axis Y of the electric pump Ep.<br><br>
[0035] The inside terminal 52 on tiie lower face of the mounting base member 2 is disposed radially outward of the electric pump Ep, and the regulator valve R is disposed immediately above the power-supplying terminal 47 between the inside terminal 52 and the connection tube 29 on the lower face of the mounting base member 2.<br>
[0036] Moreover, the regulator valve R is disposed so that at least part thereof is above the upper face of the mounting base member 2.<br>
[0037] Furthermore, the fuel takeoff pipe 12 and the coupler 48 are disposed on the same diameter X when looking at the plane of the mounting base member 2, while their openings face outward in diametrically opposite directions from each other. Moreover, the retaining hole 43, formed in the lower face of the mounting base member 2, into which the regulator valve R is fitted and retained, the guide tube 53 similarly formed on the lower face of the mounting base member 2 and surrounding the inside terminal 52, and the connection tube 29 are disposed so that their axes are parallel to one another.<br>
[0038] With regard to the regulator valve R, which is disposed immediately above the power-supplying terminal 47, since an opening end of the valve chamber 42 faces the power-supplying terminal 47, fuel discharged from the valve chamber 42 drops onto the upper face of the electric pump Ep around the power-supplying terminal 47. In order to make the fuel thus dropped return into the fuel tank T, a cutout window 51 is provided in a peripheral wall of the upper pump holder 3A. [0039] The operation of this embodiment is now explained.<br>
[0040] In the electric pump Ep, when the electric motor E operates, the pump impeller 24 is rotated by means of the rotor shaft 20a. Accompanying this, fuel within the fuel tank T is sucked into the pump chamber 22 via the suction port 25 while being filtered through the fuel strainer 4, pressurized by means of the pump impeller 24, then pumped to the interior of the stator 17 via the discharge port 27, and supplied from the final discharge port 34 to the fuel injection valve I via the fuel discharge pipe 30 and the fuel takeoff pipe 12, that is, the fuel passage 28.<br><br>
[0041] During this process, since tine pressure of the fuel passage 28, that is, the discharge pressure of the electric pump Ep, acts on the valve body 39 of the regulator valve R via the pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a, when the discharge pressure of the electric pump Ep exceeds a predetermined value, the valve body 39 opens against the set load of the pressure-regulating spring 40, part of the fuel within the fuel passage 28 is discharged to the valve chamber 42 side, and when the pressure of the fuel passage 28 returns to the predetermined value, the valve body 39 is closed again by the set load of the pressure-regulating spring 40. Since the pressure of the fuel passage 28 is thus automatically regulated at a predetermined value, the fuel injection pressure from the fuel injection valve I is controlled appropriately.<br>
[0042] Furthermore, fuel discharged from the valve chamber 42 of the regulator valve R drops onto an upper face 18a of the upper bearing bracket 18 around the power-supplying terminal 47, that is, the upper face of the electric pump Ep, and is returned into the fuel tank T after passing through the cutout window 51 of the upper pump holder 3A. Since the area around the power-supplying terminal 47 Is therefore continuously washed by fuel discharged from the regulator valve R, fuel does not remain around the power-supplying terminal 47, thereby preventing corrosion of the power-supplying terminal 47 by moisture contained in fuel that has remained there. [0043] Moreover, since fuel that has dropped onto the upper face 18a of the upper bearing bracket 18 has its kinetic energy attenuated there and then quietly flows down onto fuel held within the fuel tank T via the cutout window 51 of the upper pump holder 3A, the sound of fuel dropping can be eliminated.<br>
[0044] Furthermore, when the discharge pressure of fuel discharging from the electric pump Ep into the fuel passage 28 pulsates, the pulsations are transmitted to the pressure regulation path upstream portion 35a side, and in this case before reaching the regulator valve R the pulsations are transmitted to the pouch-shaped recess 45, which branches prior to the regulator valve R, and are attenuated by collision with the inner wall of the pouch-shaped recess 45. As a result, it is possible<br><br>
to prevent vibration of the valve body 39 of the regulator valve R due to pulsations of the discharge pressure of the electric pump Ep, thus guaranteeing that the regulator valve R exhibits a correct function in regulating pressure, and thereby stabilizing the fuel injection pressure of the fuel injection valve I.<br>
[0045] Furthermore, pulsations in the pressure might occur in the fuel passage 28 as a result of opening and closing of the fuel injection valve I, but these pulsations can be attenuated by the same action as above; moreover, pulsations in the pressure might occur in the fuel passage 28 as a result of opening and closing of the regulator valve R, and these pulsations can also be attenuated by the same action as above. [0046] Furthermore, since pulsations in the pressure of the fuel passage 28 can be attenuated by extremely simple attenuating means in which the pouch-shaped recess 45 branches prior to the regulator valve R, there is no increase in the number of components, and there is no increase in the cost of the fuel supply module M. [0047] Since the inside terminal 52 of the mounting base member 2 is disposed radially outward of the electric pump Ep, after the connector 50a at one end of the lead wire 50 is connected to the power-supplying terminal 47 on the upper face of the electric pump Ep, even after the electric pump Ep has been supported in close proximity to the mounting base member 2, the connector 50b at the other end of the lead wire 50 can be connected to the inside terminal 52 without interference by the electric pump Ep. It is therefore unnecessary to provide a working space between the inside terminal 52 and the power-supplying terminal 47 in the vertical direction for connecting the lead wire. Moreover, in the mounting base member 2, there is a wide space between the inside terminal 52 disposed radially outward of the electric pump Ep and the connection tube 29 connected to the fuel discharge pipe 30 of the electric pump Ep, and since this wide space is utilized for installation of the regulator valve R, the space efficiency improves, and this regulator valve R does not interfere with positioning the mounting base member 2 close to the electric pump Ep. As a result of the above, the mounting base member 2 and the electric pump Ep can be disposed close to each other, thus making the fuel supply module compact.<br><br>
[0048] Furthermore, since the fuel discharge pipe 30 and the power-supplying terminal 47 of the electric pump Ep are disposed on opposite sides of and sandwiching the axis Y of the electric pump Ep, and the regulator valve R is disposed immediately above the power-supplying terminal 47, the three, that is, the fuel discharge pipe 30, the power-supplying terminal 47, and the regulator valve R can be efficiently disposed in a concentrated manner above the electric pump Ep, which is effective in making the fuel supply module M compact. Moreover, since fuel discharged from the regulator valve drops around the power-supplying terminal, the area around the power-supplying terminal is continuously washed by fuel discharged from the regulator valve, the fuel does not remain around the power-supplying terminal, and it is thereby possible to prevent corrosion of the power-supplying terminal due to moisture contained in fuel that has remained there. [0049] Furthermore, by disposing the regulator valve R so that at least part thereof is above the upper face of the mounting base member 2, it is possible to dispose the mounting base member 2 and the electric pump Ep close to each other in an effective manner while reliably avoiding interference by the regulator valve R, thus making the fuel supply module M more compact.<br>
[0050] A method for molding the synthetic resin mounting base member 2 is now explained by reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5.<br>
[0051] When molding the synthetic resin mounting base member 2, a pair of left and right upper molds 60 and 60 and one lower mold 61 are prepared. Formed between the left and right upper molds 60 and 60 are an upper cavity 62a for molding portions that project from an upper face of the flange portion 2a, that is, the fuel takeoff pipe 12, the coupler 48, etc., and a gate 63 communicating with the upper cavity 62a. Open/close faces P of the two upper molds 60 and 60 are set so as to pass through the axes of both the fuel takeoff pipe 12 and the coupler 48. Disposed removably between the two upper molds 60 and 60 are cores 64 and 65 for molding horizontal portions of the fuel passage 28 and the pressure regulation path 35 and a hollow portion of the coupler 48.<br><br>
[0052] Formed between the upper molds 60 and 60 and the lower mold 61 is a lower cavity 62b for molding the flange portion 2a and its lower portion, that is, the flange portion 2a, the connection tube 29, the guide tube 53, etc.<br>
[0053] When molding the mounting base member 2, the inside terminal 52 is first supported at a predetermined position on the lower mold 61, the left and right upper molds 60 and 60 are superimposed on the lower mold 61 in a closed state, the cores 64 and 65 are then set, and the outside terminal 49 is supported on one of the cores 65. Following this, molten synthetic resin is injected and made to fill the cavities 62a and 62b via the gate 63, thus molding the mounting base member 2. After the mounting base member 2 has solidified, the cores 64 and 65 are pulled out, the left and right upper molds 60 and 60 are opened from each other, and the upper molds 60 and 60 are opened from the lower mold 61, thus enabling the mounting base member 2 to be removed from these molds.<br>
[0054] In this way, the mounting base member 2 can be molded using an extremely small number of molds, that is, the left and right upper molds 60 and 60 and one lower mold 61, and this is achieved as described above by disposing the takeoff pipe 12 and the coupler 48 on the same diameter X when looking at the plane of the mounting base member 2, while their openings face outward in diametrically opposite directions from each other, and by arranging the axes of the retaining hole 43, the guide tube 53, and the connection tube 29 for the fuel discharge pipe 30, which are formed in the lower face of the mounting base member 2, so that they are parallel to one another.<br>
[0055] The present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and may be modified in a variety of ways as long as the modifications do not depart from the spirit and scope thereof.<br><br><br>
