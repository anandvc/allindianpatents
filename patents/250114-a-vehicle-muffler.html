EMCON Technologies Germany (Augsburg) GmbH<br>
A 3051 WO<br>
Vehicle Muffler<br>
The invention relates to a vehicle muffler comprising opposite outer end walls,<br>
a closed outer circumferential wall formed by coiling a sheet metal part, at least<br>
one muffler insert, at least one inlet tube and at least one outlet tube.<br>
The invention relates in particular to a transverse downstream muffler.<br>
Concerning the manufacturing of the circumferential wall, mufflers are divided in<br>
two modes of manufacturing, namely mufflers made up of a shell construction<br>
and such made up of a coiled construction. In the case of a shell construction two<br>
deep-drawn sheet metal parts are connected with each other at their edge, while<br>
with the coiled construction a sheet metal part is coiled around a core and is<br>
closed, subsequently the insert piece and the outer plates are inserted from the<br>
side and then closed axially by crimping.<br>
The invention relates to a vehicle muffler in coiled construction. Usually, the<br>
gas inlet and gas outlet are provided on the end walls, namely optionally at<br>
opposite sides or on the same side. It is also common to lay the gas inlet through<br>
a circumferential wall into the muffler, with the inlet tubes being welded with their<br>
ends to the circumferential wall.<br>
The invention relates to an exhaust gas muffler in which the connection<br>
between the tube associated with the circumferential wall and the circumferential<br>
wall itself is more stable and stands under less strain.<br>
This is achieved in an exhaust gas muffler of the type initially mentioned in<br>
that one of the tubes extends through the circumferential wall into the muffler<br>
interior and is fastened to this circumferential wall and the insert piece. Thus, the<br>
tube is not only connected with the exhaust gas muffler through the<br>
circumferential wall, but is consequently supported at two spaced points on and<br>
in the exhaust gas muffler. This also has the advantage that a second vehicle-<br>
side supporting outside the exhaust gas muffler, which has been provided up to<br>
now, may be dispensed with. The fastening of the tube to the insert piece is not<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
restricted to an axial slide bearing, which would only act radially relative to the<br>
longitudinal extension of the tube. Rather, the tube is firmly connected with the<br>
insert piece both in its axial and radial direction.<br>
The fastening of the tube to the insert piece is preferably done by mechanical<br>
deformation. This mode of fastening is less susceptible to corrosion than welding.<br>
Further advantages over welding are the smaller distortion of the components<br>
and the higher strength.<br>
A mechanical deformation can also be performed starting in the tube interior,<br>
i<br>
which is of advantage to the effect that the tube end with a previously closed<br>
circumferential wall is not accessible from outside any more.<br>
The tube and the insert piece are usually pressed onto each other.<br>
It lends itself to connect the entire tube along its circumference with the insert<br>
piece in the region of the contact area. As an alternative, a segment-wise<br>
connection of the circumference is also possible.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment the insert piece has at least one inner<br>
end wall for the formation of a chamber, a support wall being fastened to this<br>
inner end wall to which, in turn, the tube is fastened. The support wall, however,<br>
usually lies fastened between two opposite end walls.<br>
A preferred embodiment makes provision that the insert piece, to which the<br>
circumferential wall is fastened which extends through the tube, is clamped in<br>
longitudinal direction of the muffler merely by the tube. This preferred<br>
embodiment allows an unhindered thermal expansion of the insert piece in axial<br>
direction (axial related to the muffler axis).<br>
It would also be possible, however, to provide more than one tube which is<br>
coupled with the muffler interior via the circumferential wall, so-called multi-pass<br>
systems (in particular two-pass and four-pass systems). Here, the invention<br>
provides for two tubes, for instance, which protrude through the circumferential<br>
wall into the muffler interior, which are fastened at their free end pieces to two<br>
neighboring insert pieces.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
following description and the following drawings to which reference is made and<br>
in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is an exploded view of a two-pass embodiment of the vehicle<br>
muffler according to the invention,<br>
-	Figure 1a is a sketch of the circumferential wall of the muffler according to<br>
the invention,<br>
-	Figure 2 shows an enlarged view of the middle region of the muffler<br>
according to Figure 1,<br>
-	Figure 3 is a view, partly in cross-section, of a one-pass muffler according to<br>
the invention,<br>
-	Figures 4 and 5 are sectional views through the region of the coupling of the<br>
inlet tube to the insert piece according to two different embodiments; and<br>
-	Figure 6 schematically shows a cross-section through the region of the<br>
coupling of the inlet tube to the insert piece according to an alternative<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a transverse two-pass vehicular exhaust gas muffler, in the<br>
following briefly referred to as vehicle muffler or muffler only. The muffler has an<br>
outer housing made up of opposite outer end walls 3, 5 and a circumferential wall<br>
7 which is illustrated in Figure 1a in a somewhat simplified manner. The<br>
circumferential wall 7 is coiled from a sheet metal part, with the outer longitudinal<br>
edge 9 being welded to the inner edge portion after coiling. As an alternative, the<br>
two longitudinal edges may also be connected with each other by crimping.<br>
In Figure 1 the circumferential wall is omitted so that the muffler interior can<br>
be better viewed. The muffler interior can be divided in two halves, namely a left<br>
and a right half. These halves are separated by end walls 11,13 which are axially<br>
spaced from each other. The left half has further end walls 17, 19, which are<br>
provided with through-flow openings 15 and subdivide the left half in three<br>
chambers 34, 36, 37 in total. An outlet tube 21, 39 in each of the halves is<br>
provided with (not illustrated) openings at thet outer periphery and extends<br>
through the end walls 3, 5, 17 and 19, it being welded at least to the end wall 3<br><br>
-4-<br>
and 5, respectively. Arranged between the end walls 11, 19 is a support wall 23<br>
made of sheet metal and welded to the end walls ,11, 19.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2, the end wall 19 is connected with the end walls 3<br>
and 17 through further connection tubes 25, 27 of differing cross-section. The<br>
end walls 17, 19, 11 together with the tubes 25, 27 and the support wall 23 form a<br>
muffler insert which is surrounded by the sheet metal part.<br>
The support wall 2.3 has, as can be clearly seen in Figure 2, cross-shaped<br>
embossments 29 which enhance its stability. An inlet tube 31 extends through an<br>
opening in the circumferential wall 7 (see Figure 2) and is welded to it along the<br>
entire tube circumference. The inlet tube 31 extends further into the muffler<br>
interior and also through a relative tight opening in the support wall 23 (see also<br>
Figures 4 and 5). The support wall has, in the region of the passage opening for<br>
the inlet tube 31, a sleeve-shaped edge 33 which is produced by plastic<br>
deformation.<br>
In Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that the left half the inlet tube 31 ends<br>
shortly after having passed through the support wall 23. At a certain distance<br>
from this point, a connection tube 27 begins which has a 90° bend. The tube 27<br>
extends through aligned through-flow openings 15 of the end walls 17, 19.<br>
As can be seen from a comparison of the left and right halves, the inlet tube<br>
31 of the right branch opens into a thicker connection tube 35 which leads into a<br>
middle chamber 37. The outlet tube 39 of the right branch opens likewise into this<br>
middle chamber 37. Moreover, further tubes 25 between the end walls 5, 13, 17,<br>
19 are also provided in the right branch, with corresponding end walls having<br>
reference symbols which have already been introduced for the left half. Some of<br>
the tubes 25 may be stabilizing bars which are provided between the end walls<br>
and have no gas flowing through them.<br>
The outlet tube 39 also extends through the outer end wall 5 and is welded to<br>
it. In the widened ends of the outlet tubes 21, 39 so-called end tubes 41 are<br>
inserted from the outside. The same applies for the inlet tubes 31. These also<br>
have an outwardly, widened end, into which so-called intermediate tubes 43 are<br>
inserted.<br><br>
-5-<br>
1<br>
In the following the manufacturing of the exhaust gas muffler according to the<br>
invention will be explained. First, the insert pieces consisting of the inner end<br>
walls and the connection tubes as well as the support wall 23 are produced and<br>
connected with the outer end walls 3, 5. A sheet metal part is wrapped or coiled<br>
around a core and is welded as illustrated in Figure 1a. The circumferential wall 7<br>
already has openings for the passage of the inlet tubes 31. Subsequently the<br>
insert pieces are axially inserted from both sides into in the circumferential wall 7,<br>
the so-called casing, and the end walls 3, 5 are connected with the casing 7.<br>
The inlet tubes 31 are inserted through these openings until they too protrude<br>
through the corresponding openings in the support walls 23.<br>
Subsequently, the inlet tubes 31 are fastened to the associated support walls<br>
23, more precisely, by mechanical deformation. For this purpose, a tool, e.g. a<br>
kind of embossing tool or rotating rolls, penetrate the interior of the corresponding<br>
tube 31. The tube 31 is plastically deformed e.g. along its entire tube<br>
circumference in the region of the sleeve-like edge 33 in outward direction under<br>
formation of a groove, with the edge 33 being deformed. In this way, the tube 31<br>
and the support wall 23 are axially and radially pressed and connected with each<br>
other in the manner of an interlocking and frictional fit.<br>
The groove between the two deformed portions has the reference symbol 51.<br>
In Figure 4, it is easy to identify the bulge-like protrusion 53 which has formed in<br>
the support wall 23.<br>
Instead of a closed surrounding groove 51 the tube 31 and the support wall<br>
23 can also be pressed onto each other in segments, as illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
Here, the tube 31 has been pressed outside only at a few sections 55 which are<br>
circumferentially spaced from each other, with the formation of bulges 53 on the<br>
edge 33.<br>
For the purpose of a radial locking it would also be possible to provide a<br>
press-fit between the two parts.<br>
Figure 6 schematically shows an alternative to the deformation shown in<br>
Figures 4 and 5. The difference to the embodiments of Figures 4 and 5 is that the<br>
tube 31, as seen in axial direction, is plastically deformed outwardly, i.e. in radial<br>
direction, in front of and behind the edge 33. In this process, the edge 33 is not<br><br>
-6-<br>
deformed. The resultant bulges lock the edge 33 in axial direction. It is also<br>
possible to deform the tube 31 only in sections, similarly as shown in Figure 5, in<br>
front of and behind the edge 33.<br>
Another possibility for deformation is to flange the free end part of the tube 31,<br>
which extends through the opening, in an outward direction, resulting in a locking<br>
in axial direction.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 3 essentially corresponds to the<br>
embodiment shown in the Figures which have been described so far, so that in<br>
the following only the differences need be discussed. Parts with the same<br>
function receive the reference symbols which already have been introduced<br>
earlier.<br>
This transverse exhaust gas muffler is also provided with a coiled<br>
circumferential wall 7. The muffler is a one-pass model and has only one central<br>
inlet tube 31. This inlet tube 31 is welded, as with the already mentioned example<br>
embodiments, to the circumferential wall 7 and protrudes through the latter and<br>
through the support wall 23. Downstream of the support wall 23 the tube 31 is<br>
expanded at the circumference at several sections 55 which are spaced from<br>
each other. A sleeve-like edge 33 may be dispensed with here, which incidentally<br>
also applies for the embodiment mentioned before. The central insert piece in the<br>
muffler interior consists of the end walls 11, 19, the support wall 23 as well as the<br>
connection tubes or corresponding connection bars 25. This insert piece is<br>
positioned in the axial direction A only by the inlet tube 31. The outlet tube 39<br>
protrudes with a slide fit through the end wall 19. Due to this design, smaller<br>
forces will be exerted on the walls during heating and cooling of the muffler and,<br>
as a consequence, all individual parts are subject to smaller strains, which also<br>
applies to the weld seams for the fastening of the tubes 21, 31, 39, 41.<br>
It would also be possible that - instead of the inlet tube 31 - the outlet tubes<br>
21, 39 pass through the circumferential wall 7.<br>
The support wall 23 is preferably aligned at right angles to the longitudinal<br>
axis X of the inlet tube 31 which passes through it.<br><br>
