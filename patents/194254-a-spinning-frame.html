				<td>The present invention relates to a spinning frame according to ,the preamble of claim 1, as was for instance disclosed in DE 40 00 226 Al.<br>
In order to produce a certain yarr^n a spinning frame by means of the drawing unit it is necessary t;o maintain a predetermined ratio of drawing. For this it is necessary that the numbers of revolutions of the single drawing unit cylinders required for the drawing remain in a defined relationship with one another. In older spinning frames this was achieved in that only one drive motor was provided together with a changing gear to drive all cylinders of the drawing unit at the same time.<br>
Recently however, spinning frames have been developed in which at least two drawing unit cylinders are driven separately, preferably, however each drawing unit cylinder is  being driven by an own motor on both ends. The required ratio of drawing can<br><br>
Due to the independent electronic control oi   the rotational speed of the single cylinders in such spinning frames the gear change, being required in older spinning frames, is not necessary. In order to produce different types of yarn it is, however, not only necessary to change the speed of the single drawing unit cylinders, but it is also necessary to adjust the distance between them. For this reason even in spinning frames with separately driven drawing unit cylinders, expensive mechanical changes are necessary.<br><br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a spinning •frame as described above which is capable of producing a great number of different types of yarns in a cost effective way.<br>
The object is achieved with a spinning frame<br>
In that the drive motors of at least one drawing unit cylinder, together with the pertaining gears and drawing unit cylinder, is being shiftable along the direction of drawing as a unit in relation to the at least one further driven drawing unit cylinder, only at both ends of the drawing unit cylinder a single mechanical adjustment is required in order to change the distance to the neighbouring drawing unit cylinder. A change of the spinning frame thus requires only minimal re-fitting efforts.<br>
The preferred embodiment according to which at least three driven drawing unit cylinders are provided in the spinning frame and whereby at least two of the cylinders are shiftable, automatically shiftable respectively, in relation to a third drawing unit cylinder being fixedly connected with the machine frame, thus increases the flexibility to produce different types of yams, whereby with a coplanar arrangement of the cylinders and the possibility to shift two cylinders in the direction of the drawing, the structure is simplified in so far as that both cylinders can be shifted together with their gears and motors along common guides for instance on a carriage.<br>
According to the invention the pre-cylinder, feeding cylinder respectively from which the yarn is delivered to the spindles, is not being shifted thus the travelling distance of the yarn from the drawing unit to the spindles remains unchanged.<br>
Furthermore it is preferred to provide an initial gear between each motor and the drwing unit cylinders comprising two tooth belt pulleys and a tboth belt running between said pulleys to<br><br>
'transfer the turning moment. This is of advantage because the tooth belt, particularly during slow rotation of the drive motor, can absorb the resulting jerks and thus prevent damage of the following gear stages usually comprising gear wheels and at the same time providing a reduction of the rotational speed of the motor. By providing a relocating gear within the drive line between at least one pair of motors and the pertaining cylinder being arranged on both sides of the cylinders the single drawing unit cylinders can be arranged particularly close to each other. This way spaces of below 30 mm can be achieved between said cylinders. Preferably the two outer cylinders, that means the front- and the back-cylinder are provided with relocating gears, while the middle cylinder being arranged between them is not provided with a relocating gear.<br>
Further, preferably on both sides of a cylinder, an intermediate gear is provided within the driving line between the drawing unit cylinder and the pertaining motor to reduce the motor rotations, so that the motor can be driven at preferably high rotational rate, thereby avoiding jerks. In connection with the toothed belt gear thus damage of the gear wheels can be prevented in a specially reliable way.<br>
The gear can be arranged in a particularly simple design if each drive motor is connected rotation locked with its pertaining cylinder during each operating phase of the spinning frame, thus eliminating expensive and difficult controllable clutches, as they are for instance described in DE 40 00 226. With the especially preferred application of reluctance motors as speed-controlled drive motors, even without the use of a clutch during start up and slowing down of the spinning frame, no drawin  deviations occur.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular, with a drawing unit comprising several, preferably three, driven drawing unit cylinders, and free rotatable counter-rollers being pressed against said drawing cylinders, to form at least one drawing zone, located between two respective drawing unit cylinders, together with counter-rollers assigned to them, whereby at least two drawing unit cylinders are being furnished with separate, preferably speed-controlled drive motors and whereby at least one gear is located in the drive line between the respective drive motor and the pertaining drive cylinder characterised in that at least one drive motor being located at one end of a drawing unit cylinder, together with the pertaining gear and the drawing unit cylinder is being shiftable at a right angle to a cylinder axis as a unit, in relation to the at least one further driven drawing unit cylinder.<br><br>
The invention is being described only as -ui example m connection with the drawing, <br><br>
fig. 3   a schematical side view of a drawing unit of a<br>
spinning frame according to the invention, seen from the opposite side as shown in figure 1.<br>
According to figure 1 a drawing unit 10 comprises a back cylinder i.e. entry cylinder 16 working together with a crosshatchedly indicated freely rotating upper counter roller 16', a middle cylinder 14 working together with a crosshatchedly indicated upper counter roller 14' and a front-i.e. feed cylinder 12 working together with a crosshatchedly indicated upper counter roller 12', being arranged coaxially and coplanar. At the entry gap between the back cylinder 16 and the counter roller 16' a roving to be drawn is supplied from a roving bobbin not further shown and being led through the clamping line between the middle cylinder 14 and a counter roller 14' and the clamping line betwtien the front-cylinder 12 and a pertaining counter roller 12' to a (not shown) spindle.<br>
The counter rollers 12', 14', 16' are arranged on a guide arm 58 being swivable in upward direction around an axis 60, whereby counter roller 12' of the front cylinder is being arranged fixedly and the counter rollers of the middle cylinder and back cylinder 14', 16' respectively are being arranged shiftably in the direction indicated with double arrows.<br><br><br>
preferred control system for the separatti drive motors 18, 20, , 22 is disclosed in the patent application P being submitted at the same time under the title „Electronic gear" (our reference R 3355), whose substance of disclosure by way of reference is also object of the present invention. At the opposite ends the drawing unit cylinders 12, 14 16 according to figure 3 are carried in supports 30", 30'", 30"" respectively, whereby<br><br>
One end of the back cylinder 16 and the gear 28 provided at this end, extending upwards from the drawing unit, and the motor 22 are, for instance, through an arrangement of carriages being guided on tracks, fixedly connected with one another to form one unit 30, which can be shifted parallel to the line II-II running through the axis of the drawing unit cylinder, which, further comprises the counter rollers 16' provided on each spinning unit and which is also connected with the support 30".<br>
In a similar manner, one end of the middle cylinder 14 and the gear 26 provided at this end, extending slantedly upwards from the drawing unit away from the gear 28 of the back cylinder 16, and the motors 20 by arrangement on a carriage are fixedly connected with one another to form a unit 30', which is shiftably guided in the same direction as the unit 30 and preferably on the same track as the unit 30, which further -, comprise a counter roller 14' at each spinning unit and which are connected with the support 30''.<br><br>
One end of the front cylinder 12 and the respective gear 24 extending from the drawing unit downwards and the motor 18 being attached below the drawing unit are supported fixedly on the machine frame 46, this in the same way as the support 30'' provided at the other end of the front cylinder.<br>
In the following the arrangement of the gears is described in detail with reference to figure 2.<br>
According to figure 2 the front cylinder 12 is on both drive sides being connected with a first output shaft 40a of a relocating gear 38a whose input shaft '52a is at greater distance from the middle cylinder 14 than the front cylinder 12 itself. The input shaft 42a of the relocating gear is rotation locked with an output shaft of an intermediate gear 44a, which preferably provides a ratio of reduction in the range from 1:5 to 1:10, and preferably provides a ratio of reduction of 1:7 in particular.<br><br>
On the input shaft of the intermediate gear 44b a belt pulley 34b is provided, around said pulley a tooth belt 52 is led to a<br><br>
tooth belt pulley 54 (figure 1) which is rotation locked on the output shaft of a motor 20 pertaining to it.<br>
The back cylinder 16 is on both ends rotation locked with the output shaft 40b of a relocating gear 38b, whose input shaft 42a like the relocating gear 38a of the front cylinders is rotation locked at approximately the same distance from the machine column with the output shaft of an intermediate gear<br><br><br>
The drive motors 18, 20 and 22 are preferably rotation-controlled drive motors, in particular synchronous/ reluctance motors respectively, which, compared to conventional synchronous motors have the advantage that they can draw themselves autonomously into synchronism. They can be controlled as described in our application mentioned above.<br>
The spinning frame of the present invention operates as follows:<br>
For readjusting the distances of the drawing unit cylinders, according to figure 1, at first the back cylinder 16 and its pertaining driving line are shifted tc their maximum distance away from the front cylinder 12. Then the distance between the<br><br>
front cylinder 12, which together with its gear 24 and its pertaining motor 18 as well as its support 30'' (figure 3) is fixedly mounted on the machine frame 46  and the middle cylinder 14, whose one end together with its pertaining gear 26 and drive motor 20 are being arranged on the carriage as a unit 30' (indicated with dotted line), and whose other end with the support 30'' (figure 3) are together shiftable, is adjusted to a distance necessary for the yarn to be produced of for instance between 29 and 42,5 mm between the centres of said drawing unit cylinders, whereby for the case that &amp; carriage is being furnished said carriage together with its gear 26 and its pertaining motor 20 slides on respective tracks provided for it. Both ends of the middle cylinder 14 are moved to the same extent. The middle cylinder 14 being shifted into its desired position is then fastened in said position.<br>
Thereafter the back cylinder 16 is then, according to the requirements of the yarn to be produced, l)Ging shifted together with its pertaining gear 28 and the drive motor 22 as a unit 30 and with the support 30' (figure 3), from its position at maximum distance to the front cylinder 12, towards the middle cylinder 14, to the required distance of Jor example 41,5 to 55 mm between the centres of the drawing unit cylinders 14 and 16, where it is fastened.<br><br>
Then the motor speeds, taking into account the ratios of reduction on the gear arrangement being required for the ratio of drawing, can be adjusted at a drawing unit control system (not shown), as is for instance described in our patent application P (our reference: R3355) also being submitted.<br>
At excitation of the motors 18, 20, 22 the gears 24, 26, 28 transmit the driving torque imiriediately to the pertaining drawing unit cylinders 12, 14, 16 without the necessity of a<br><br><br>
Due to the fact that within the driving line a reduction of the motor speed is provided by means of the spur wheel gear as well as the intermediate gears, each motor quickly reaches a rotational speed during start-up by which no more jerks can develop. Additionally at comparatively high rotational speed the motor speed can be better kept at the desired speed level, so that less drawing errors occur during the production.<br>
In long drawing unit cylinders the illustrated drive arrangement is preferably provided on both ends of the drawing unit cylinders, that means that instead of the supports 30', 30'' and 30'' according to figure 3 also on this end of the drawing unit cylinder drive motors like motor 18, 20, 22 respectively and gear 24, 26, 28 respectively and if necessary relocating gears 38 are provided, whereby possibly measures can be provided to prevent uneven shifting on both ends of a drawing unit cylinder. A structural unit 30' can be shifted automatically along a guide 70 by employing a motor 62 fitted in the frame 46, whereby said motor drives a spindle 64 which acts together with a screw socket 66 being attached to the structural unit 30'.<br>
Shifting of the units 30, 30' does not necessarily have to be done parallel to the direction of drawing, but could also be done in form of a swivel movement around a turning point which however, should be at a very far distance from the drawing unit cylinders 12, 14, 16 so that the shifting at   least basically is carried out parallel to the direction of   drawing.<br><br><br>
