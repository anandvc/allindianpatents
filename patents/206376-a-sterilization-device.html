The present invention relates to a sterilization device. Particularly the invention relates to a sterilization device for infant care and more particularly to a sterilization device for the sterilization of feeding bottles, artificial rubber teats and other articles.<br>
The sterilization unit is particularly suitable for articles such as particular plastic feeding bottles, artificial rubber teats and the like, which are buoyant and float in liquid.<br>
Sterilization in boiling water is the most commonly employed and effective way to sterilize feeding bottles, artificial teats and other articles, and such method has been used widely around the world. Scientific devices and apparatus have been made and used for the sterilization of surgical instruments, appliances and these are used in hospitals, labs, research centers and other places. The domestic use of such apparatus is not so common.<br>
The most common and popular method used for the sterilization of infants feeding bottles, artificial teats and other plastic/rubber and other articles which are for infant use is boiling in water. Doctors recommend that feeding bottles for infants should be sterilized before each use, but in practice, this is not practicable especially in the outdoors and during travel and the feeding bottles are therefore<br><br>
-2-<br>
used without proper sterilization. Sometimes the bottles are physically washed in running tap water which does not help in tackling bacteria on the contrary is a source of further contamination.<br>
To tackle such problem solutions that have been suggested are not very effective. It is known to dip the feeding bottles in aqueous sterilant medium. The sterilant medium is put in a container and feeding bottles are dipped in the container. The sterilization thus effected using such method is not very effective for the reason that the nipple portion of the bottle or the rubber teats tend to float on the medium and all portions of the nipple/teat is not submerged in the medium. Therefore such sterilization method is not reliable and effective.<br>
The applicant has developed a unique container for sterilization using conventional liquid sterilant to overcome the shortcomings of the existing facilities and methods.<br>
The novel container according to the invention comprises a body portion for holding the liquid sterilant therein, said body having a mouth for filling and removing the sterilant and for inserting and removing the article to be sterilized, a lid removably engaged to the said mouth portion, a pressing element held to the<br><br>
-3-<br>
lid and adapted to push the article to be sterilized below the level of the sterilant to keep it submerged.<br>
The container of the invention is substantially cylindrical. Some portions of the container may be flatenned in a manner that one or more bottles may be accommodated in the bottle which the volume inside the container is reduced whereby less sterilant is used. By the use of the device according to the invention the article to be sterilized can be fully submerged in the liquid sterilant and all parts of the article are exposed to the sterilant and the article is fully sterilized.<br>
The most common sterilant is sodium hypochlorite. This is available commercially in concentrated form to be diluted during use. One such sterilant concentrate which is suitable for such application is marketed under the brand name "Feedol". The prescribed dose of the sterilant is put in the water in the container and used as sterilant. Usually 10 (ten) ml of Feedol is put in 1.5 liters of water. Sterilants in tablet or other solid forms may also be used.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br><br>
-4-<br>
Fig. 1 is a preferred typical form of a container and lid closed and functional position;<br>
Fig. 2 is a preferred form of the container and lid in open position ;<br>
Fig. 3 is a view of the container without lid ;<br>
Fig. 4 is a view of the container from bottom ;<br>
Fig. 5 is an element of the pressing member which connected to the said member to the bottom of the lid ;<br>
Fig. 6 a view of the lower element of pressing member which presses the rubber articles in use.<br>
In the drawings a preferred embodiment of the device is shown for a clearer understanding of the invention but the scope of the invention will also cover other forms of the device within the scope of the claims of the specification.<br><br>
-5-<br>
In fig. 1 a typical embodiment of the container C is shown. The container C is substantially cylindrical and has flatenned portions 6 in a diametrically opposite portion. The flattered portions 6 have such dimensions that two feeding bottles 7 and 8 can be placed side by side inside the container. The flattened portions 6 reduces the volume of the container and thereby consumes less water/sterilant 9 in use and is particularly aimed at economizing the use and reducing the weight of the loaded container. The flatenned portion also helps to better grip the container with one hand and also prevents the container from slipping when used with wet hands.<br>
The container mouth has threads 10 and the lid has corresponding threads for engagement thereto. A pressing member (3, 4) is held to the bottom face of the lid. The container is provided with a level mark 11 which is a guidance for the end user. In use, drinking water is poured into the container C up to the level mark 11. The prescribed dose of sterilant material is added to the water. The sterilant material is wholly soluble in water and a homogeneous sterilizing fluid 9 is made which is ready to use.<br>
The article, namely two feeding bottles 7 and 8 and rubber teats 12, to be sterilized are put in the fluid sterilizing medium 9. The rubber teats 12 float in the<br><br>
-6-<br>
liquid 9. The lid 1 having the pressing member (3, 4) is then screwed onto the mouth of the container. The pressing member (3, 4) goes inside the container and presses the rubber articles 12 under the fluid level so that these are fully submerged in the sterilizing medium. In absence of the pressing member (3,4) the rubber articles would float and some part of its would not get properly sterilized.<br>
Therefore, by the use of the device according to the invention total sterilization may be achieved most efficiently including during travel and other outdoor conditions.<br>
The sterilization process is continuous and used articles may be sterilized any number of times during the period the sterilant has efficacy. The currently available sterilizing material e.g. Feedol is effective for about 24 hours. The instructions of the sterilant manufacturer should be strictly followed to achieve the desired results.<br><br>

CLAIMS :<br>
1.	A sterilization device comprising body portion for holding the liquid sterilant<br>
therein, said body having a mouth for filling and removing the sterilant and for<br>
inserting and removing the article to be sterilized, a lid removably engaged to<br>
the said mouth portion, a pressing element held to the lid and adapted to<br>
push the article to be sterilized below the level of the sterilant to keep it<br>
submerged.<br>
2..	A sterilization device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the container is<br>
