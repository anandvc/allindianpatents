CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Japanese Patent Application No.2008-236745, filed on September 16, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated heroin by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of Art<br>
The present invention relates to a solid-liquid separator for separating impurities to be collected from raw water.<br>
2.	Description of Relevant Art<br>
Water treatment employs in a process thereof a soUd-liquid separation treatment such as a gravitational settling, flocculation sedimentation, or dissolved air flotation.<br>
In the gravitational settling or flocculation sedimentation, raw water inflows to a settling tank, where impurities contained in raw water as targets of collection heavier in specific gravity than water are settled by use of differences in specific gravity between water and impurities, and a supernatant is taken as treated water, whereby raw water is separated into impurities and treated water. In this case, the settling rate is varied in accordance with impurities' specific gravity, size, etc. For instance, for impurities relatively small in settling rate, the settling rate is raised by increase in volume of the settling tank, or the settling efficiency is raised by use of an inclined plate or inclined pipes for enhancing the settlmg rate. However, even with such a rise in settling efficiency by use of an inclined plate or inclined pipes, there is an issue of the residence time still requiring one hour or more, because of the limit in reduction of residence time, as well as the size in volume of settling tank.<br>
In the dissolved air flotation, for buoyant impurities such as fat or solid materials relatively light in specific gravity, air is pressurized to dissolve in recirculating separated water or the like, which is let to inflow to a separation tank, where miaoscopic bubbles are formed and attadied to impurities to surface for separation, whereby raw water is separated into<br><br>
impuririss and treated water. For the dissolved air flotation, impurities with adherent bubbles have a surfacing speed of 200 mm/min or less. Therefore, dissolved air flotation also needs a long time for treatment, as an issue.<br>
For reduction of the treatment time having been a problem in giavitational settling or dissolved air flotation in the past, there is a method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 11-333320, in which raw water is swirled in a container to separate impurities by use of centrifugal forces.<br>
In the method of swirhng raw water as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 11-333320, swirhng streams should have high speeds to produce strong centrifugal forces, and impurities once separated are caused to roll up by high speeds, with a potential re-mbcing to treated water, as an issue.<br>
For prevention of the re-mixing of impurities, there is a technique disclosed in Japanese Utihty Model Registration AppHcation Laid-Open Publication No. 5-9656, which produces swirling streams in a container of a double-cylinder stmcture with an inner cylinder made of a porous material or as a filter.<br>
There is also a technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Application I^id-Open Publication No. 2002-66387, which includes a container for producing swirling streams, and has a nozzle provided to a lower portion of the container for discharging impurities, and adapted to function as a check valve made of an elastic material.<br>
However, the provision of a doubled container is unable to cope with a potential re-mixing of impurities due to a roll-up in a central region of the container. The provision of an elastic check valve constitutes, if the elasticity is too high, a difficulty for impurities to pass through, resulting in an insufScient collection of impurities, and if the elasticity is too low, a marred function of check valve, resulting in a damage on check valve while running.<br>
The present invention has been devised in view of such issues, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid-solid separator adapted to prevent impurities separated from raw water from being re-mixed in raw water, allowing for an enhanced separation performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, a solid-iiquid separator is adapted for raw water supplied to separate into impurities and treated water, and comprises a liquid cyclone configured for inflowing raw water containing impurities as targets of collection to be forced to swirl inside to spin down impurities contained in raw water, an inflow pipe connected with an upper portion of the liquid cyclone to supply the liquid cyclone with raw water, and configured for supplied raw water to be forced tf-i- swirl inside the liquid cyclone, a connecting portion connected with a lower portion of the liquid cyclone, and configured with a discharge port to discharge spun down impurities from the liquid cyclone, an impurity collector connected to the liquid cyclone with the connecting portion in between, and configured to collect impurities discharged fi-om the hquid cyclone, an obstacle disposed in or near the discharge port, and configured to prevent impurities collected in the impurity collector firara backing up into the liquid cyclone, and an outflow pipe coimected with a top portion of the liquid cyclone, and configured for raw water having got rid of impurities to outflow as treated water from the hquid cyclone.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS There will be described solid-liquid separators according to embodiments of the present invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like elements are designated by Uke reference characters, omitting redundant description.<br><br>
i First Embodiment)<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a solid-liquid separator la according to a first embodiment of the present invention, which includes: a Liquid cyclone 11 configured for raw water containing impurities as solid targets of collection to inflow therein to be swirled inside thereof to spin down impurities the raw water contain; an inlet or inflow pipe 10 connected with a cylindrical upper portion 12 of the hquid cyclone 11 to supply the liquid cyclone 11 with raw water, and configured for raw water being supphed to be guided to swirl inside the liquid cyclone 11; a short cylindrical connecting portion 15 integrated at an upper end thereof with a conical or tapered lower portion 13 of the liquid cyclone 11 and configured to define a discharge port 151 for discharging impurities spun down by the liquid cyclone 11; a short cylindrical impurity collector 14 integrated with a lower end of the connecting portion 15 and configured for collection of impurities discharged from the discharge port 151; an obstacle 16a disposed in or near the discharge port 151 to bafQe or prevent impurity-carrying countercurrents from backing up from the impurity collector 14 again inside the hquid cyclone 11; and an outlet or outflow pipe 20 inserted through a top wall of the hquid cyclone 11 and configured for raw water having got rid of knpurities to outflow as treated water from the hquid cyclone 11. It is noted that the liquid cyclone 11, the knpurity collector 14, and the connecting portion 15 in between are all coaxially arranged.<br>
The impurity collector 14 has a discharge line 18 connected to a central outlet at a bottom thereof for discharging collected impurities, and the discharge line 18 has a valve 19 installed therein.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the hquid cyclone 11 is composed of the cylindrical portion 12 and the taper portion 13 inchned relative to the cylindrical portion 12, and configured for raw water incoming from the inflow pipe 10 to be caused to swirl inside thereof. As raw water swirls in the liquid cyclone 11, such impurities that are suspended in raw water and heavier in specific gravity than water are forced outwards by centrifugal forces acting thereon, and spun down along the wall of the taper portion 13, so they pass through the discharge port 151 of the connecting portion 15, and enter the impurity collector 14, where they are collected.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the connecting portion 15 has the obstacle 16a held thereto by a holder 17a. The obstacle 16a is a circular planer member held horizontal by the<br><br>
holder 17a made of wire elements secured to the wall of the connecting portion 15, and co-centered with the discharge port 151, so the obstacle has a center thereof on a center axis of the hquid cyclone 11. The obstacle 16a has a thickness determined in consideration of probable swirling f)Ower of raw water, tensile forces of the holder 17a, etc. This thickness is not limited, but too thin obstacle might be broken by power of row water.<br>
Asffiscussed above, impurities being forced outwards are spun down along the wall of the connecting portion 15, so they pass through spaces between the obstacle 16a and the connecting portion 15, to be collected inside the impurity collector 14.<br>
The impurity collector 14 collects impurities together with raw water. In the unpurity collector 14, collected water moves, so collected impurities flow, rolling or backing up, with potentials to mn again into raw water in the liquid cyclone 11, as an issue. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the obstacle 16a stands between the hquid cyclone 11 and the impurity collector 14, whereby collected impurities in the impurity collector 14 are effectively prevented from running again into raw water in the hquid cyclone 11. In particular, collected impurities tend to roll up near the center axis of the liquid cyclone 11, with an inaeased potential re-mixing of impurities, which can be effectively prevented by the obstacle 16a arranged near the center axis.<br>
According to the first embodiment, a soUd-liquid separator la mcludes a liquid cyclone 11 for swirhng raw water, and an unpurity collector 14 for collecting unpurities, with an obstacle 16a disposed in between, thereby preventing a re-mixing of up-rolled impurities.<br>
(First modification of the first embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Fig. 3 of a solid-liquid separator lb according to a first modification of the first embodiment. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the solid-hquid separator lb is different from the solid-liquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has a conical obstacle 16b substituting for the circular obstacle 16a. The obstacle 16b also is held by a holder 17a made of wire elements secured to a connecting portion 15.<br>
Down-spinning impurities bemg forced outward with centrifugal forces actmg thereon have their weights and swirling speeds, and may well be settled on an obstacle, where they might have been accumulated if the obstacle were such a circular obstacle 16 as illustrated in Fig. 2. To this point, the conical obstacle 16b has an inclined lateral face serving for impurities to<br><br>
slide do'^T, to-^-ard an impurity collector 14 with an increased tendenc}', and can prevent accumulation of impurities on the obstacle 16b, allowing for a promoted collection of impurities at the impurity collector 14.<br>
(Second modification of the first embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Figs. 4, 5A, and 5B of a solid-liquid separator Ic according to a second modification of the first-embodiment. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the solid-liquid separator Ic is different from the soUd-liquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has a conical obstacle 16c formed with spiral grooves 161c substituting for the circular obstacle 16a. The obstacle 16c also is held by a holder 17a made of wire elements secured to a connecting portion 15.<br>
Down-spinning impurities being forced outward with centrifugal forces acting thereon have their weights and swirling speeds, and may well be settled on an obstacle, where they might have been accumulated if the obstacle were such a circular obstacle 16 as illustrated in Fig. 2. To this point, the conical obstacle 16c has an inclined lateral face with spiral grooves 161c cut therein serving for impurities to slope down toward an impurity collector 14 with an increased tendency, and can prevent accumulation of impurities on the obstacle 16c, allowing for a promoted collection of impurities at the impurity collector 14.<br>
(Third modification of the first embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Figs. 6, 7A, and 7B of a solid-liquid separator Id according to a third modification of the first embodiment. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the solid-liquid separator Id is different from the solid-liquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has an obstacle 16d suspended by a holder 17d, not fi-om the wall of a connecting portion 15, but fi:om a top wall of an impurity collector 14. The holder 17d is configured like a cradle in a different form relative to the holder 14a, while it is made up by wire elements like the holder 14a.<br>
The solid-liquid separator Id in f Fig. 6 is still different from the solid-Uquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that the obstacle 16d is formed, unlike the ckcular planer obstacle 16a, as a cylindrical obstacle provided with a conical top portion.<br>
The holder 17d has a flat receiver portion for the obstacle 16d to be placed thereon, and a suspender portion for suspending the receiver portion. If the suspender portion were long,<br><br>
the obstacle lo on the receiver portion would oscillate with ease. Therefore, the suspender portion is set short, and the obstacle is given a small height, to thereby render the obstacle 16d stable.<br>
There is a liquid cyclone 11 in which spiral swirUng flow of impurity-containing raw water is displaced in a vertical direction, whereto the suspender potion of the holder 17d extends in parallel, whereby tk^holder 17 is the less exposed to power of swirling flow, and has an enhanced durability. The conical top portion of the cylindrical obstacle 16 has a slope ending on a cylindrical obstacle face, which prevents accumulation of impurities on the obstacle 16d.<br>
The conical top portion of the cylindrical obstacle 16 has an aspect ratio set up by adjustments of, among others, slope inclination and bottom diameter, for a facilitated collection of impurities at the impurity collector 14. Adjustments are made also of spacing distances between the connecting portion 15 and the obstacle 16, for enhanced effects on the prevention against roll-up of impurities from the impurity collector 14 to the liquid cyclone 11.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Figs. 8 and 9 of a solid-liquid separator le according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the sohd-liquid separator le is different from the soUd-liquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has, in place of the obstacle 16a held by the holder 17a, a bar-shaped cylindrical obstacle 16e erected upright on a bottom wall of an impurity collector 14.<br>
There is a liquid cyclone 11 in which raw water incoming from an inflow pipe 10 swirls, with power producing forces that would have acted on, among others, the obstacle 16a and the holder 17a. During a long service exposed to such power, the obstacle 16a as well as the holder 17a might have become easy to break. To this point as illustrated in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, the obstacle 16e now employed is formed in an elongate cylindrical shape that should be kept hard to break even in exposure to flow of raw water.<br>
The obstacle 16e has a center axis thereof coincident with a center axis of the Uquid cyclone 11. Impurities are collected in an impurity collector 14, where they tend to axially roll up at the center of the impurity collector 14, where the obstacle 16e is erected for an effective prevention against a re-mixing of impurities. The obstacle 16e is coaxially arranged to the collector 14, and an outlet at the bottom of the collector 14 is offset relative to the center axis, for<br><br>
conneaion with a discharge line 18.<br>
According to the second embodiment, in a sohd-liquid separator le, an obstacle 16e erected in an impurity collector 14 is extended inside a discharge port 151, thereby enabling a prevention against a re-mixing of up-rolled impurities, allov^ing for an enhanced durabihty of the obstacle 16e.<br>
The obstacle 16e may have a top end thereof curved or foimed with grooves for a promoted introduction of impurities to the impurity collector 14. The obstacle 16e may have a modified shape, such as a conical shape, to prevent accumulation of impurities thereon.<br>
(Third Embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Figs. 10 and 11 of a solid-Uquid separator If according to a third embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 10, the soUd-hquid separator If is different from the solid-hquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has a magnet (or a loop of magnets) 21 arranged over an outer periphery of an impurity collector 14.<br>
Assuming impurities separated from raw water by the sohd-liquid separator If as magnetically attractive metaUic impurities, when having entered an impurity collector 14, they are attracted by magnetic forces, and remain inside the unpurity collector 14, with an enhanced effect on the prevention against a re-mixing into raw water in a Uquid cyclone 11.<br>
As the collection of impurities extends over a long term, there appears an increasing quantity of impurities attracted by the magnet 21 and accumulated on the wail of the impurity collector 14. However, the magnet 21 has a preset hmit of magnetic forces, which is exceeded before the impurity collector 14 becomes filled with impurities. Once the limit is exceeded, a discharge line 18 serves to discharge an exceeding quantity of impurities. As impurities are accumulated much on the wall of the impurity collector 14, the impurity collector 14 has a deaeased amount of impurities flowing inside, with a suppressed roU-up of impurities, allowing for a prevented re-mixing of impurities to raw water in the liquid cyclone 11.<br>
According to the third embodiment, in a sohd-liquid separator If, an impurity collector 14 has a magnet 21 arranged therearound, allowing for a prevented re-mixing of impurities.<br>
(Fourth Embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Fig. 12 of a soUd-liquid separator Ig according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the<br><br>
solid-liquid sepaiaior Ig is different from the solid-liquid separator If of Fig. 10, in that it has an electromagnet (or a loop of electromagnets or a solenoid) 22 arranged in place of the magnet 21, and a controller 23 adapted to control the electromagnet 22.<br>
In the solid-liquid separator If of Fig. 10, the wall of the hnpurity collector 14 would have impurities remaining attracted thereon, so long as they are attracted by magnetic forces of the magnet 21, with a difficulty to rid the impurity collector 14 of an entirety of collected impurities by discharging through a discharge line 18. To this point, magnetic forces of the electromagnet 22 are controllable to turn off by the controller 23, so those impurities attracted by the electromagnet 23 and accumulated on the wall of the impurity collector 14 can be discharged through a discharge line 18.<br>
According to the fourth embodiment, in a solid-liquid separator Ig, an impurity collector 14 has an electromagnet 22 arranged therearound, allowing for a prevented re-mixing of impurities, and a complete discharge of collected impurities through a discharge Une 18.<br>
(Fifth Embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Fig. 13 of a solid-liquid separator Ih according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 13, the solid-liquid separator Ih is different from the solid-hquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has pieces of cloth or fibers 24 glued on or adhering to the wall of an impurity collector 14.<br>
Impurities having entered the impurity collector 14 collide on fibers 24 adhering to the wall of the impurity collector 14, when they have smaller repulsive forces acting thereon than when colliding on a wall face free of fibers, so they have a suppressed flow rate in the impurity collector 14, resulting in a reduced roll-up of impurities, allowing for an effective prevention of a re-mixing of impurities. Fibers used may be raised fibers such as on towel or carpet.<br>
According to the fifth embodiment, in a solid-liquid separator Ih, an impurity collector 14 has fibers adhering to an inner periphery thereof, allowing for a prevented re-mixing of impurities.<br>
(Sixth Embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Figs. 14,15A, 15B, 16Ato 16E, and 17 of a sohd-Uquid separator li according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 14, the sohd-Uquid separator li is different from the soUd-liquid separator la<br><br>
ofFis. 1 . in ihat ir has an obstacle 16a held by a holder 17i substituting for the 17a.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 15, the holder 17i is composed of planer sector bafQes, unlike the 17a made of wire elements. Moreover, the holder 17i is inclined relative to the obstacle 16a.<br>
Assuming impurities as having breakable structures, when they collide on a holder, if<br>
. this were the holder 17 made of wire elements as illustrated in Fig. 1, forces acting on them<br>
&gt;!« from the holder 17a would be concentrated in part and intensified, resultingvin breakage of<br>
impurities. To this point, as illustrated in Fig. 15A, the holder 17i is composed of planer sector<br>
bafQes, and when impurities collide thereon, forces acting on them from the holder 17i are<br>
dispersed, so that impurities are kept from being broken.<br>
Further, as illustrated in Fig. 15B, the planer sector baffles are inclined, so that as illustrated in Fig. 17, streams fl of impurities being discharged from a Uquid cyclone 11 as well as streams f2 of impurities rolling or backing up from an impurity collector 14 are baffled to go in directions of arrows G and f4 to enter the impurity collector 14, thus preventing a re-mixing of impurities.<br>
In this connection, each baffle of the holder 17i may well have selective one of five sectional forms illustrated in Figs. 16Ato 16E, in accordance with, among others, impurity flow and stmcture, and raw water flow.<br>
According, to the sixth embodiment, in a solid-liquid separator li, a holder 17i is composed of planer baffles, allowing for impurities spun down from a liquid cyclone 11 to smoothly transfer to an impurity collector 14. Moreover, provision of the planer baffles in a discharge port 151 permits an effective prevention against a re-mixing of impurities.<br>
(Seventh Embodiment)<br>
Description is now made with reference to Figs. 18, 19A, and 19B of a solid-liquid separator Ij according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention. As illusfrated in Fig. 18, the solid-Uquid separator Ij is different from the solid-liquid separator la of Fig. 1, in that it has a separable cormecting portion 25. More specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 18,19A, and 19B, the connecting portion 25 is configured as a distance member separable from between a face of an upper flange 131 as a flanged bottom end of a taper portion 13 of a liquid cyclone 11, and a face of a lower flange 141 as a flanged top end of an impurity collector 14.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 18, the solid-liquid separator Ij is assembled by fastening<br><br>
together the upper flange 131 and the lower flange 141 by use of screws or bolts, with the connecting portion 25 sandwiched in between. As illustrated in Fig. 19B, the connecting portion 25 has an obstacle 16a supported by a holder 17a in between.<br>
The obstacle 16a as well as the holder 17a may become breakable under power of swirling raw water during a long-term seiyice. In this respect, the connecting portion 25 is configured to be separable, so simply the-obstacle 16a or the holder 17a as broken can be replaced with new one, without the need of replacing an entirety of the solid-liquid separator Ij.<br>
According to the seventh embodiment, in a soUd-Uquid separator Ij, an obstacle 16a is supported by a connecting portion 25 interposed between a liquid cyclone 11 and an impurity collector 14, thereby allowing for a prevented re-mixing of rolled-up impurities, in addition to that a separable configuration of the connecting portion 25 allows for a facilitated maintenance of the solid-liquid separator Ij.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described usmg specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departmg from the spirit or scope of the foUowmg claims.<br><br><br>
