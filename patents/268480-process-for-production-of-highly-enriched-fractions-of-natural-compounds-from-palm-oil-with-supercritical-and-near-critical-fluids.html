				<td>Process for production of highly enriched fractions of natural<br>
compounds from Palm Oil with supercritical and near critical<br>
fluids<br>
Background of the invention<br>
From palm oil valuable compounds like the tocochromanols, ca-<br>
rotenoids, phytosterols, and others can be derived. Enrichment<br>
to highly concentrated fractions is hindered by the enormous<br>
number of components involved, the very low volatility, the<br>
very low solubility of many of the compounds in organic sol-<br>
vents, and the high viscosity of the mixtures to be processed.<br>
As an example for the production of pre-concentrated frac-<br>
tions, the Carotech-process may be taken (Fig. 1). Caromin™,<br>
is a carotenoid enriched derivate of crude palm oil, contain-<br>
ing approximately 10% of carotenoids. The integrated process<br>
for extracting carotenoids and tocotrienols (vitamin E) is<br>
carried out according to U.S. Patent 5,157,142 and is summa-<br>
rized in Fig. 1. It involves the transesterification of crude<br>
palm oil (CPO) to methyl esters (FAME), followed by vacuum<br>
distillation and other steps, resulting in a carotene-rich<br>
layer and a tocotrienol-rich layer. The carotene-rich layer,<br>
as well as the tocotrienol-rich layer are further concentrated<br>
to produce highly concentrated products of a maximum content<br>
of 30 % for carotenoids, and a maximum content of about 50 %<br>
for tocochromanols, mostly tocotrienols. Further enrichmebnt<br>
with conventional methods proved to be not possible because of<br>
the high viscosity, very low volatility, and low solubility in<br>
conventional organics solvents. Although a number of investi-<br>
gations have been carried out on various mixtures, mostly to-<br>
copherols, with supercritical fluids, no process was able to<br>
produce fractions of high concentrations for both the to-<br>
cochromanols and the carotenoids from crude palm oil or other<br>
natural sources.<br><br>
Fig. 1. Process for production of concentrated fractions of<br>
mixed carotenoid and tocotrienols (U.S. Patent 5,157,142).<br>
Carotenes, which impart the distinctive orange-red colour to<br>
palm oil, together with tocopherols contribute to the stabil-<br>
ity and nutritional value of the oil. To a great extent these<br>
and other minor constituents determine the quality character-<br>
istics of palm oil Carotenoids are often recovered from natu-<br>
ral fat or oil, particularly from palm oil. Carotenoids can be<br>
extracted from unsaponified distillation residue. They can be<br>
also extracted employing adsorbent in some stage of the proc-<br>
ess. During the extraction, large amounts of organic solvents<br>
are needed. Adsorptive processes so far have not led to higher<br>
concentrated carotene fractions from natural sources. Reasons<br>
are the initial low concentrations, the high viscosity of<br>
carotene fractions, and the instability of carotenes on most<br>
adsorbents. Numerous attempts to design a process for produc-<br>
ing higher concentrated fractions of carotenes have been made.<br>
Carotenoids are the most widespread and important pigments in<br>
living organisms. The most widely known carotenes are the -,<br>
- and -carotenes, and lycopene. Beside their colour, carote-<br>
noids, especially -carotene, are well known to possess pro-<br>
vitamin A activity as they can be transformed into vitamin A<br>
in vitro. They have also been found to inhibit anti-cancer<br>
properties due to their ability to deactivate oxy-radicals. As<br>
the carotenes are natural compounds with vitamin A property,<br>
they played a positive role in commercial applications for<br>
pharmaceutical and nutritional products synthesis. [1, 2].<br>
Carotenoids are found in numerous vegetable oils, including<br>
groundnut oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower-seed oil and cottonseed<br>
oil. The concentration of carotenoids in these oils is gener-<br>
ally low, less than 100ppm. Among these, palm oil is the rich-<br>
est natural plant source of carotene in terms of retinol<br>
equivalent, with Malaysia contributing the highest percentage<br><br>
of world palm oil production. Palm oil contains the highest<br>
known concentration of carotenoids, ranging from 500 to<br>
3000ppm, depending on the species of the palm fruit from which<br>
the oil is obtained. [1, 2] The concentration of carotenes in<br>
crude palm oil from Malaysia varies between 500 to 700ppm,<br>
with - and -carotene form up to 90% of the total carotenes.<br>
[3].<br>
Nowadays, carotenes found on the market are chemically syn-<br>
thetic -carotene or carotene extracted from algae Dunaliella.<br>
Since carotenoids are most probably to grow in importance and<br>
value, the recovery of carotenoids from palm oil and its by-<br>
products becomes important. Various extracting methods for re-<br>
covering carotenes from palm oil have been developed over the<br>
years including saponification, urea processing, selective<br>
solvent extraction, molecular distillation, separation by ad-<br>
sorption, crystallization, and transesterification followed by<br>
distillation of esters. [1,4,5].<br>
Tocochromanols: Vitamins are important substances for the hu-<br>
man health. They are regulating various processes in the body<br>
and have positive effects on many vital functions. In general<br>
terms vitamins act as coenzymes or pro-hormones while most of<br>
their other functions like anti-carcinogen or anti-oxidizing<br>
effects are yet to be researched. Most of the vitamins cannot<br>
be synthesized by the human body and therefore these nutrients<br>
have to be ingested with the food. Since vitamins vary in<br>
their structure and their functions, a first approach is to<br>
categorize them into water soluble and oil soluble groups. Wa-<br>
ter soluble vitamins are distributed within the whole body and<br>
there-fore they are taking effect in almost all organs, while<br>
oil soluble vitamins are mostly present in the membranes. The<br>
transport in the blood stream and the digestion of these vita-<br>
mins can only be done if a sufficient amount of oil lipids and<br>
micelles are present.<br><br>
Vitamin E is the generic term for eight substances from the<br>
group of the tocochromanols that possess a Vitamin E activity.<br>
The tocochromanols can be subdivided into two groups: the to-<br>
cochromanols and the tocotrienols: with the tocotrienols pos-<br>
sessing three unsaturated double bonds in their hydrocarbon<br>
chain and the tocopherols possessing a completely unsaturated<br>
hy-drocarbon chain. Both tocopherol and -trienol subgroups<br>
consist of: four homologous, designated as -, -, -, and -<br>
tocopherol (-trienol), depending on the substitutes of their<br>
chroman-ring. The tocochromanols are oil soluble anti-oxidants<br>
which are mostly found in the cell membrane of organs, -<br>
tocopherol has the highest anti-oxidant activity and therefore<br>
it is mostly used as anti-oxidant in the food and cosmetic in-<br>
dustry. Nevertheless recent studys report further functions of<br>
the other tocochromanol homologous like anti-carcinogen or<br>
anti-tumor properties.<br>
As a consequence the demand on natural tocochromanol mixtures<br>
consisting of all homologous is steadily increasing. The<br>
fruits of the malaysian oil palm possess the highest content<br>
of tocochromanols in the world. Crude palm oil (CPO) consist<br>
of 94 wt.% tryglycerides, 3-4 wt.% free fatty acids (FFA), and<br>
only 1 wt.% of the CPO consist of tocochromanols, carotinoids<br>
and phytonutrients. Palm oil is available in large quantities<br>
and at a comparatively low price. It is the largest source for<br>
tocotrienols. Tocotrienols can be recovered from the distil-<br>
late fractions obtained during the refining and deodorisation<br>
of the crude palm oil. The carotenoids are destroyed during<br>
this process. It is therefore reasonable to try to recover<br>
both groups of valuble compounds in one process sequence. The<br>
most economic way would be to adsorb these compounds from the<br>
crude palm oil on an appropriate adsorbent and remove the com-<br>
pounds subsequently from the adsorbent. Numerous attempts have<br>
been made. So far no success was obtained. Therefore, the need<br>
for another approach led to the transesterification of the<br><br>
triglycerides of palm oil to fatty acid methyl esters and<br>
their removal by vacuum distillation. The further process of<br>
generating higher concentrated fractions is limited by the<br>
mentioned properties of the mixtures. The needs for a differ-<br>
ent process are obvious.<br>
Here, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is an alternative<br>
to conventional extraction with organic solvents. SFE is able<br>
to yield in a solvent free extract and due to its low critical<br>
temperature can be used for the treatment of temperature sen-<br>
sitive substances like vitamins. Supercritical fluids can dis-<br>
solve the low volatile components and carry them through any<br>
process via the gaseous phase. Furthermore, highly viscous<br>
liquid solutions dissolve a great amount of supercritical flu-<br>
ids, in particular carbon dioxide and propane, with the effect<br>
of a much reduced viscosity. Then, even the liquid solutions<br>
can be handled in a process.<br>
Although these facts have each for itself been known for some<br>
time, the surprising effects for a further enrichment of the<br>
tocochromanols and the carotenoids by applying appropriate<br>
combinations of counter current SFE separation and SFE-<br>
adsorptions with subsequent selective SFE-desorption have not<br>
been recognized. The state of the art achieved so far is re-<br>
viewed in the following.<br>
State of the art<br>
Tocochromanols:<br>
The research done on extraction of natural materials with su-<br>
percritical carbon dioxide is increasing these days. The<br>
critical parameters of carbon dioxide is 7,4MPa and 304,21K<br>
[6]. Because of these low critical parameters, using super-<br>
critical carbon dioxide is resulting in low operation cost and<br>
because of the low critical temperature even temperature sen-<br>
sitive materials can be extracted. In contrary to organic sol-<br>
vent, carbon dioxide is non toxical, non inflammable, and in-<br><br>
ert. Moreover, carbon dioxide is easy available and can be re-<br>
moved completely from the desired product without residues.<br>
The solubility of carbon dioxide can be adjusted by the den-<br>
sity, therefore it can be adjusted to the feed material. These<br>
are the reasons for the enormous amount of research work in<br>
the field of supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. Ill'es<br>
et al. [7] and Gnayfeed et al. [8] for example were research-<br>
ing the extraction of red pepper and pepper oil with super-<br>
critical C02 and subcritical propane in respect to the toco-<br>
pherol and carotine content. It was found that the solubility<br>
of the supercritical carbon dioxide was not sufficient to dis-<br>
solve carotine. The solubility of the tocopherols in both sol-<br>
vents was good, and it was possible to dissolve tocopherols in<br>
both C02 and propane. Nagesha et al. [9] and Shishikura et al.<br>
[10] have researched the enrichment of tocopherols from soy<br>
deodorizer distillate by supercritical uid extraction. Further<br>
research work has been done on the enrichment of squalene from<br>
an intermediate of the olive oil production (Dreschner et<br>
al.[ll]) and the enrichment of tocopherolacetate and toco-<br>
pherol (Fleck [12]) .<br>
The adjustment of the solubility of the supercritical carbon<br>
dioxide through the density gives the supercritical extraction<br>
a high flexibility. But because of the lacking polarity of the<br>
carbon dioxide the solubility for polar substances is limited.<br>
One possibility to increase the solubility is to add a modi-<br>
fier to the supercritical carbon dioxide. Common modifiers are<br>
iso-propanol, ethanol and propane. It should not be neglected<br>
that an increase of solubility with modifiers is often paired<br>
with a decrease in selectivity. Thus recent studies focus on<br>
an additional adsorption process prior the supercritical ex-<br>
traction. Due to the additional adsorption, the selectivity of<br>
the process can be increased, since the adsorbent has a dif-<br>
ferent affinity to the different components. The result is<br>
that the components are adsorbed and desorbed to a different<br><br>
extent. Wang et al. [13] researched the separation of -<br>
tocopherol and squalene using a pressure swing adsorption<br>
technique with supercritical carbon dioxide as solvent. In the<br>
first stage of the process the feed is mixed with supercriti-<br>
cal CO2 and enters a column filled with silica gel at low pres-<br>
sure, where the feed adsorbs on the silica gel. In the second<br>
stage the adsorbt is desorbed off the silicagel with pure su-<br>
percritical carbon dioxide under high pressure. During these<br>
experiments Wang et al. was able to enrich -tocopherol from a<br>
20 wt.% feed to 60 wt.% and squalene from 80 wt.% to 98 wt.%.<br>
Theoretical work on adsorption and desorption in supercritical<br>
carbon dioxide has been done by Reverchon et al. [14] and Goto<br>
et al. [15]. The research group of Reverchon used a Langmuir<br>
similar multi component adsorption isotherm in order to de-<br>
scribe the adsorption behaviour of a complex terpene mixture<br>
under supercritical conditions, wheras the research group of<br>
Goto used the BET adsorption isotherm to do their simulation.<br>
Both works lead to mathematical models which are capable to<br>
simulate experimental data with a high accuracy.<br>
Lee et al.. [16] published a work on the adsorption kinetics of<br>
phospholipids from treated soy oil on regenerated clay. The<br>
research group of Lee used a reaction kinetic equation in or-<br>
der to describe the adsorption process by measuring the con-<br>
centration before and after the adsorber. This was a totally<br>
different approach then the authors before, since no adsorp-<br>
tion isotherm is used at all to describe the system. Neverthe-<br>
less the research group of Lee was able to derive a reaction<br>
equation which is capable to predict the experimental data.<br>
The regeneration of modified clay with supercritical carbon<br>
dioxide was researched by Cavalcante et al. [17] and Carneiro<br>
et al. [18]. Modified clay is an important adsorbent in the<br>
environmental technology, since its ability to adsorb organic<br>
substances is very important in the field of water treatment.<br>
Therefore the regeneration of the clay is an important eco-<br><br>
nomical issue for the economical efficiency of the process.<br>
Zetzl [19] dealt with the separation of avors from lemon oil<br>
by applying a selective adsorption on silicagel followed by a<br>
desorption under supercritical carbon dioxide. The desorption<br>
curve of limonen and citral was researched and a model was in-<br>
troduced which described the experimental data with a high ac-<br>
curacy.<br>
A patent for the separation technique of selective adsorption<br>
followed by a desorption with supercritical CO2 was filed for<br>
separating terpenes out of essential oils. The European patent<br>
EP 0363971 A2 [20] describes such a process. The oil is mixed<br>
by stirring at a constant temperature with the adsorbent and<br>
then it is; extracted with supercritical CO2. This is possible<br>
because of the low viscosity of the treated oil.<br>
Carotenoicls:<br>
The Japanese patent JP200226723 [21] presents a method for the<br>
enrichment of carotene from palm oil. Palm oil is first trans-<br>
esterified. The ester is then extracted with a hydrophilic<br>
solvent such as methanol to separated it into a concentrated<br>
ester phase. This concentrate is then applied to a column<br>
packed with silica gel to adsorb carotene. Carotene is then<br>
desorbed using hexane which contains around 4000 ppm aceton.<br>
Adsorptive concentration of the carotene-rich concentrate was<br>
also employed in U.S. Pat. No. 6072092 [22], where silica gel<br>
is used ass adsorbent and a large amount of non-polar solvent<br>
is used to recover carotene.<br>
European patent EP0242148 [23] describes a similar method us-<br>
ing silica gel or activated alumina as adsorbent and a non po-<br>
lar solvent containing certain amounts of polar solvents as<br>
eluant for the enrichment of carotene.<br><br>
Japanese patent JP63132871 [24] describes a process to enrich<br>
carotene applying Zeolite as adsorbent and a non polar sol-<br>
vent, such as carbon tetrachloride as eluant.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5157132 [25] describes a process recovering<br>
carotene from oil through transesterification and saponifica-<br>
tion. The enriched carotene can be extracted from the saponi-<br>
fied residue with an organic solvent. The obtained residue has<br>
a carotene content of 20%.  Also European patent EP1398311<br>
[26] describes a similar process. 10% to 20% of carotene con-<br>
centrate can be obtained.<br>
German patent DE 4429506 [27] presents the extraction of caro-<br>
tenoids from dried material with propane or butane. It was<br>
found that the solubility of both gases can be greatly im-<br>
proved when a co-solvent is used.<br>
These patents require organic solvents in a large amount as<br>
eluant and recovery of the solvents by distillation to obtain<br>
the carotenoids concentrate. In the new process only propane<br>
and supercritical CO2 are used as solvents at low temperatures<br>
to obtain the concentrate. These solvents can be easily re-<br>
moved by expansion.<br>
Most techniques described in literature that use supercritical<br>
carbon dioxide or other compressed gases for the enrichment of<br>
both phytosterols and tocochromanols from edible oil start<br>
from very low concentrations of the here-treated components.<br>
Hence, the main focus of these works lies on depleting the oil<br>
from substances like triglycerides or FAME, because these are<br>
the by far most prominent substances when dealing with crude<br>
or esterified oil, respectively. Additionally, most described<br>
processes are batch-wise operated. Thus, the here-described<br>
approach, starting from an already enriched palm oil deriva-<br>
tives and employing a combination of a continuously operated<br>
extraction column with an adsorption/desorption operation on<br><br>
the one side and a subsequent extraction has not yet been ap-<br>
plied.<br>
Description of the Invention: General description<br>
The vitamin compounds of the group of the tocochromanols and<br>
carotenoids are enriched from mixtures derived from natural<br>
oils in the process described below. These mixtures contain<br>
fatty acid methyl esters or fatty acid ethyl esters, squalene,<br>
monoglycerides, diglycerides, sterols, and the target com-<br>
pounds.<br>
With supercritical carbon dioxide as solvent, in a first sepa-<br>
ration sequence (Fig. 2, columns Cl and C2), from the to-<br>
cochromanols or the carotenoids are removed the compounds more<br>
soluble in supercritical carbon dioxide than the target com-<br>
pounds at the top of a counter currently operated separation<br>
column, and the less solube soluble compounds at the bottom.<br>
This process leads to concentrations for the tocochromanols of<br>
about 70 wt.-%, and for the carotenoids of about 30wt.-%. The<br>
details of this separation are given below.<br>
In a second sequence, directly following the countercurrent<br>
process, the mixtures are processed by selective adsorption<br>
and desorption steps (Fig. 2, adsorbers A1, A2, A3). Adsorp-<br>
tion takes place from the mass flow taken from the countercur-<br>
rent separation comprising a supercritical or near-critical<br>
fluid and the target compounds, and is directly deposited on<br>
the adsorbent. In this way, the handling of the highly viscous<br>
solution or solid solution is made possible. Subsequently, de-<br>
sorption is carried out from the fixed bed loaded with the<br>
feed mixture. Desorption may be carried out with the same su-<br>
percritical or near critical fluid, or a different one, or in<br>
a sequence of two or more of such solvents. Desorption is also<br>
carried out at different conditions compared to the adsorp-<br>
tion, i.e. different values of pressure, temperature, flow<br>
rate of gas. Supercritical or near critical solvents may com-<br><br>
prise mixtures of supercritical or near critical fluids, pref-<br>
erably of carbon dioxide and propane.<br>
It was found that the separation by adsorption and desorption<br>
can be improved by not filling the whole adsorbent with the<br>
feed mixture, but only part of it. During desorption a se-<br>
quence of adsorption and desorption steps take place, which<br>
increase the separation efficiency, and thus the concentra-<br>
tions of the separated fractions. The ratio of the first ad-<br>
sorbed section to the free section of the fixed bed of adsorb-<br>
ent is variable, usually from (3.5 to 0.1.<br>
Fig. 2. Flow sheet of the process for concentrating tocochro-<br>
manols and carotenoids by SFE technology.<br>
Tocochromanols<br>
The new process for the production of highly enriched to-<br>
cochromanol-fractions, containing mostly tocotrienols from<br>
palm oil derived mixtures combines a continuous countercurrent<br>
multistage; separation using a supercritical fluid, preferably<br>
carbon dioxide, to remove the lighter volatile (i.e. the com-<br>
pounds more soluble in supercritical compound, resp. carbon<br>
dioxide) over the top of the column. The bottoms of the column<br>
are an enriched fraction in tocotrienols with a relatively<br>
high content in sterols and other somewhat polar compounds.<br>
This bottom fraction is passed over a suitable adsorbent.<br>
Silicagel was found to be an applicable adsorbent. The ad-<br>
sorbed mixture is desorbed by a supercritical fluid, prefera-<br>
bly carbon dioxide in two desorption steps. The first is car-<br>
ried out at a pressure of about 140 bar and removes more vola-<br>
tile or more in supercritical carbon dioxide soluble com-<br>
pounds. In the second desorption step, carried out at about<br>
250 bar, highly enriched tocochromanol fractions, containing<br>
mostly tocotrienols, are extracted. The extracted fractions<br>
can be split further by collecting them in different vessels.<br>
Depending on the cut of the fractions, the concentration of<br><br>
tocotrienols is in the range of 85 to nearly 100% with a yield<br>
of about 50% of the feed mixture. The adsorbent is regenerated<br>
with liquid solvents like ethanol etc. and reused for the ad-<br>
sorption step.<br>
The process starts with a pre-enriched fraction, which may be<br>
obtained by several methods, one may comprise transesterifica-<br>
tion of the glycerides with methanol and removing the obtained<br>
fatty acid esters by short-path-distillation or by extraction<br>
with supercritical fluids, like carbon dioxide. For example,<br>
the starting material for the first extraction step was a palm<br>
oil derivatives that among other substances contained 56 wt.-%<br>
tocochromanols (with -tocotrienol, -tocotrienol, and -<br>
tocopherol being the major components), 16 wt.-% squalene, 5<br>
wt-% phytosterols (with -sitosterol and campesterol being the<br>
most prominent species), and 11 wt.-% mono- and diglycerides.<br>
This material was fed into a continuously operated extraction<br>
column, employing supercritical carbon dioxide as solvent. The<br>
column was packed with a structured Sulzer EX packing and has<br>
an inner diameter of 17.5 mm and a total height of 7 m, of<br>
which 6 m are packed. Employing pressures of 20-30 MPa and<br>
temperatures of 323 to 358 K, it was possible to produce a<br>
sterol- and tocochromanol-free top product, only extracting<br>
specifically FAME, squalene, and monoglycerides, hence obtain-<br>
ing a bottom product enriched to about 70% tocochromanols with<br>
phytosterols and other most probably more polar compounds com-<br>
prising the rest.<br>
A longer column would have completely depleted the bottom<br>
phase from the higher-volatile components. With chemical engi-<br>
neering methods the necessary height for complete separation<br>
of FAME, squalene, and monoglycerides from tocochromanols,<br>
sterols, and other low-volatile components was calculated. The<br>
results are that a complete separation of these components is<br>
possible with 13 theoretical separation stages, corresponding<br><br>
to a height of the column of about 15 m, a solvent-to-feed ra-<br>
tio of 80 to 140, with a reflux ratio of 6 to 12, at a tem-<br>
perature of 323 K, and a pressure of 20-25 MPa.<br>
Theoretically, the further enrichment of tocotrienols should<br>
be possible by employing another countercurrent separation us-<br>
ing a supercritical fluid. Experimental investigations re-<br>
vealed that the solubility of the tocotrienol-enriched bottom<br>
product in supercritical carbon dioxide is too low to be con-<br>
sidered as a solvent for a separation process. Therefore,<br>
modifiers were mixed with the basic supercritical fluid, car-<br>
bon dioxide, in order to increase the solubility. The follow-<br>
ing solvent compositions were investigated: CO2 + propane with<br>
a propane content of 29, 55, and 83%, as well as CO2 + liquid<br>
organic solvent, namely ethanol, iso-propanol, 1-butanol, and<br>
ethyl acetate, each in a concentration of 5 and 10 wt.-%, re-<br>
spectively. The measurements were conducted in a pressure<br>
range of 5-30 MPa and at temperatures of 323, 343, and 358 K,<br>
respectively, in case of experiments with propane and at a<br>
fixed pressure of 20 MPa and at temperatures of 323 and 343 K<br>
in case of the liquid modifiers. At all conditions investi-<br>
gated the concentration of the low volatile compounds was en-<br>
riched in the gaseous phase, but the selectivity with respect<br>
to tocotrienols was reduced to such an extent that sterols<br>
were dissolved in the gas-phase, hence making it impossible to<br>
enrich the tocotrienol concentration further.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that the separation factors remained<br>
high, even increased, if the bottom material was mixed with<br>
special silica gels and then desorbed or extracted from this<br>
adsorbent with supercritical carbon dioxide. The bottom prod-<br>
uct from the first enriching step was mixed with certain<br>
amounts of adsorbent (silica gel) in a ration of 4 to 10. The<br>
mixture was introduced into a column as fixed bed. Then, ap-<br>
plying a supercritical fluid (carbon dioxide) at a pressure of<br>
about 14 at a temperature of about 333 K, remaining high vola-<br><br>
tile components such as fatty acid esters and squalene were<br>
desorbed. In a second desorption (extraction)-step, at about<br>
the same temperature, but a higher pressure of about 25 MPa<br>
tocotrienols were desorbed with high concentration. With a ra-<br>
tio of adsorbent to feed of 10, a solvent ratio of supercriti-<br>
cal carbon dioxide of about 300 [kgCO2/kg Feed and hour], a<br>
fraction of 27% of the feed was obtained during 1 h with a<br>
concentration of 75% tocotrienols, after that fraction, an-<br>
other fraction of 25% of the feed with a 100% concentration of<br>
tocotrienols could be recovered in another hour. Experiments<br>
with a mixture of carbon dioxide and propane showed that the<br>
solubility could be enhanced while the selectivity was main-<br>
tained. Therefore, the solvent ratio can be lower than with<br>
pure CO2.<br>
Description of the invention:Carotenoids.<br>
A carotenoid concentrate (1 to 10 wt.-%) is fed into a con-<br>
tinuously operated extraction device, constructed as a five-<br>
stage high pressure mixer-settler. In three separation se-<br>
quences with this apparatus, employing pressures of 20-30 MPa<br>
and temperatures of 323 to 358 K, it was possible to produce a<br>
product, containing up to 30 wt.-% of carotenoids. This prod-<br>
uct is passed over the adsorbent, a special silica gel, pref-<br>
erably Zeofree 5170, whereby the mixture of carotenoids, ster-<br>
ols and other substances, and the fatty acid esters are ad-<br>
sorbed. The mixing ratio is in the range of 4 to 10. Subse-<br>
quently, the loaded adsorbent is brought into contact first<br>
with suspercritical carbon dioxide, and then with near criti-<br>
cal propane at conditions of the state, e.g. 5 MPa and 323 K,<br>
preferably in the range of 2 to 7 MPa and 313 to 343 K. With<br>
carbon dioxide, mainly non-carotenoids are desorbed and<br>
eluted, and with near critical propane, the carotenoids are<br>
desorbed. The solvent ratio of propane to feed is in the range<br>
of 20 to 100 preferably about 30. Concentration of the eluted<br><br>
carotenoids were enhanced, if during the adsorption step only<br>
a fraction of the adsorbent was loaded with the feed.<br>
Examples: Tocochromanols.<br>
Example 1: First Extraction Step.<br>
A continuous operated multi-stage supercritical extraction was<br>
conducted with pure carbon dioxide as solvent and a feed mix-<br>
ture containing 50 wt.-% tocochromanols (with -tocotrienol, -<br>
tocotrienol, and a-tocopherol being the major components), 16<br>
wt.-% squalene, 3 wt-% phytosterols (with -sitosterol and<br>
campesterol being the most prominent species), and 11 wt.-%<br>
mono- and diglycerides. The employed column had an effective<br>
height of 6 m and was packed with a structured Sulzer EX pack-<br>
ing. Operating conditions were as follows: 20 MPa, 323 K, sol-<br>
vent-to-feed ratio = 19.8, reflux ratio = 7.3. These condi-<br>
tions resulted in a top phase product consisting of 2 wt.-%<br>
FAME, 58 wt.-% squalene and it was completely depleted from<br>
tocochromanols and phytosterols. The bottom product consisted<br>
of 8 wt.-% squalene, 58 wt.-% tocochromanols, 4 wt.-% phytos-<br>
terols, and it was completely FAME-free.<br>
Example 2: First Extraction Step.<br>
A continuous operated multi-stage supercritical extraction was<br>
conducted with pure carbon dioxide as solvent and a feed mix-<br>
ture containing 50 wt.-% tocochromanols (with -tocotrienol, -<br>
tocotrienol, and -tocopherol being the major components), 16<br>
wt.-% squalene, 3 wt-% phytosterols (with -sitosterol and<br>
campesterol being the most prominent species), and 11 wt.-%<br>
mono- and diglycerides. The employed column had an effective<br>
height of 6 m and was packed with a structured Sulzer EX pack-<br>
ing. Operating conditions were as follows: 20 MPa, 343 K, sol-<br>
vent-to-feed ratio = 4 0.3, reflux ratio = 1.3. These condi-<br>
tions resulted in a top phase product consisting of 2 wt.-%<br><br>
FAME, 60 wt:.-% squalene, 2 wt.-% tocochromanols, and 1 wt.-%<br>
sterols. The bottom product consisted of 7 wt.-% squalene, 54<br>
wt.-% tocochromanols, 4 wt.-% phytosterols, and it was com-<br>
pletely FAME-free.<br>
Example 3: Production of Concentrated Fractions of Tocotrie-<br>
nols -1<br>
1 g of the bottom product obtained from example 1 was used as<br>
feed material and mixed with 10 g of silica gel, Zeofree 5170.<br>
The mixture is introduced into an empty vessel and supercriti-<br>
cal CO2 was used to desorb FAME and squalene at 13 MPa and 333<br>
K for 120 minutes. The pressure was increased to 25MPa and af-<br>
ter 60 minutes, a fraction (0.27g), which contains 80 wt.~% of<br>
tocochormanols, was collected. The pressure was held constant<br>
for another 60 minutes, another fraction (0.24g) was col-<br>
lected. This fraction contains approximately 100% tocochro-<br>
manols.<br>
Example 4: Production of Concentrated Fractions of Tocotrie-<br>
nols -2.<br>
2.4 g of the bottom product obtained from example 1 was used<br>
as feed material and mixed with 10 g of silica gel, Zeofree<br>
5170. The mixture is introduced into an empty vessel and su-<br>
percritical CO2 was used to desorb FAME and squalene at 13 MPa<br>
and 333 K for 60 minutes. The pressure was increased to 19MPa<br>
and after another 120 minutes, a fraction(1.59g) was col-<br>
lected. It contains 80 wt.-% of tocochromanols.<br>
Example 5: Carotenoids.<br>
The carotenoids concentrate containing approximately 10 wt% of<br>
carotenoids was passed over the adsorbent in an high pressure<br>
pipe with an internal volume of 50 ml. Silica gel with a mini-<br>
mum surface area of 165m2/g was used as the adsorbent with a<br>
ratio of 4:1 (12g:3g) to the amount of feed. Extraction was<br><br>
then carried out first with supercritical carbon dioxide at<br>
150 bar and 60 °C, and then with supercritical carbon dioxide<br>
at 250 bar and 60 °C. In third step, near critical propane was<br>
used at 7 MPa, 60 oC. The fractions are collected. The last<br>
fraction consisted of about 60 % carotenoids.<br><br>

Claims<br>
1.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds (tocotrienols, carotenoids, and ster-<br>
ols) from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives, characterized<br>
by a first separation step comprising countercurrent multi-<br>
stage separation with supercritical and/or near critical<br>
fluids removing the higher volatile (better soluble in the<br>
supercritical or near critical fluid) over top, yielding a<br>
bottom fraction enriched in the natural compounds and an-<br>
other countercurrent multistage separation with supercriti-<br>
cal and/or near critical fluids removing the target natural<br>
compounds over top, thus cleaning it from low volatile im-<br>
purities, and a second step comprising selective adsorption<br>
and desorption by directly adsorbing the fraction from the<br>
countercurrent separation containing the supercritical or<br>
near critical fluid on an adsorbent, and subsequently<br>
eluting the mixture from the adsorbent by the same or an<br>
other supercritical or near critical fluid and collecting<br>
different fractions.<br>
2.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds (tocotrienols, carotenoids, and ster-<br>
ols) from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives, according to<br>
claim 1 using supercritical carbon dioxide and/or near<br>
critical propane at operating conditions for the tempera-<br>
ture of 313 to 383 K, preferably between 323 and 363 K, and<br>
pressures of 5 to 45 MPa, preferably between 10 and 30 MPa,<br>
a solvent-to-feed ratio of 1 to 500, preferably between 50<br>
and 300, using a reflux of extract at the top of the column<br>
in the range of 0.1 to 50, preferably between 2 and 20.<br>
3.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds (tocotrienols, carotenoids, and ster-<br>
ols) from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives, according to<br>
claim 1, wherein a second step comprising selective adsorp-<br><br>
tion and desorption by directly adsorbing the fraction from<br>
the countercurrent separation containing the supercritical<br>
or near critical fluid carbon dioxide and/or propane, at<br>
the same pressure and temperature or at reduced density, on<br>
an adsorbent, silica gel, preferably a special silica gel,<br>
commercial name Zeofree, in a ratio of 4 to 10, in such a<br>
way that only some part of the adsorbent is loaded with the<br>
incoming feed material. Desorption (elution, or extraction)<br>
is carried out with the same or another supercritical or<br>
near critical fluid in one or more steps, preferably in two<br>
pressure steps. In a first elution step, at lower pressure<br>
in the range of 12 to 15 MPa, the higher volatile compounds<br>
still remaining in the adsorbed mixture are being removed.<br>
In a subsequent second elution, at an enhanced pressure in<br>
the range of 22 to 35 MPa, preferably 25 MPa, at tempera-<br>
tures between 313 and 373 K the lower volatile compounds<br>
are extracted. A third elutions step comprises the use of<br>
near critical propane at conditions of 3 to 10 MPa, pref-<br>
erably 5 to 7 MPa.<br>
4.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives,<br>
according to claims 1 to 3, for tocochromanol fractions.<br>
5.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives,<br>
according to claims 1 to 3, for carotenoid fractions.<br>
6.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives,<br>
according to claims 1 to 3, for sterol fractions.<br>
7.	A process for the production of highly enriched fractions<br>
of natural compounds from Palm oil or Palm oil derivatives,<br>
according to claims 1 to 3, for coenzyme Q10.<br><br>
From palm oil valuable compounds<br>
like the tocochromanols, carotenoids, phytosterols,<br>
and others can be derived. Enrichment to highly<br>
concentrated fractions is hindered by the enormous<br>
number of components involved, the very low<br>
volatility, the very low solubility of many of the<br>
compounds in organic solvents, and the high<br>
viscosity of the mixtures to be processed. Starting<br>
materials for the new process are enriched fractions<br>
of tocochromanols (about 20 to about 50 wt.-%)<br>
and/or carotenoids (about 10 to 30 wt.-%) from<br>
palm oil obtained by conventional processes, or by<br>
counter current multistage processes with supercritical<br>
carbon dioxide. These processes, not addressed<br>
here, may comprise: Removal of free fatty acids,<br>
transesterification of the triglycerides to methyl or<br>
ethyl esters, removal of the esters, e.g. by short path<br>
distillation, separation of the tocochromanol fraction<br>
from the carotenoid fraction by cooling. In the new process, fractions derived from crude palm oil, already enriched to some<br>
extent in tocochromanols, carotenoids, phytosterols, and others, are being treated by supercritical fluid technology in a unique<br>
combination of counter current separation with selective adsorption and desorption using supercritical fluids. A first enrichment,<br>
comprising one or more separation steps by application of a near critical or a supercritical fluid in a single or multistage (counter<br>
current) separation process is combined appropriately with a second enrichment step wherein the product of the first enrichment<br>
step is directly adsorbed on an adsorbent (silicagel) by passing the product flow over a fixed bed of adsorbent without substantial<br>
pressure change, and subsequent desorption with the same (or an other) near critical or supercritical fluid at the same or a different<br>
pressure as in the first separation, or by a pre-designed sequence of pressures and temperatures. For the tocochromanol enrichment,<br>
carbon dioxide at near critical conditions above the critical temperature of carbon dioxide is used. For the carotenoid enrichment,<br>
propane at near critical conditions below the critical temperature of propane is used.</td>
