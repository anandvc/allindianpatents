				<td>The object of the invention is a torsional vibration damping the driving<br>
of a reciprocating diesel engine intended for limiting the amplitude of torsional vibration transferred between the engine main shaft and auxiliary mechanisms such as fuel injection pump, timing gear, oil or water pump, by means of flexible shafts.<br>
There are known constructions, the task of which Is to limit vibration on the drive shafts of diesel engine units/Including the limitation of torsional vibration on the drive shafts of these units. To serve this purpose, suitable materials are used, or stiffening the engine construction by the use of mufti-stage cylindrical gears, instead of bevel gears and flexible shafts employed in older designs. An example of such a solution can be mounting on the engine main shaft, from the side of power transfer to auxiliary mechanisms, a viscous torsional vibration damper. Another embodiment is adopted in a known solution using flexible shafts for transferring the drive to auxiliary mechanism, an application on the injection pump drive shaft of a toothed coupling with a plastic bush in co-operation with lubricating oil, damping the vibration on this shaft effectively enough.<br>
There are also known solutions, when considering a complete equipment, where torsional vibration is limited by means of more than one damping unit. As an example, a solution can be indicated here known from the American Patent Specification No. 4 955 833, where torsional vibration transmitted from the engine shaft to the boat propeller is limited by the use of a damper constructed of an elastomer sleeve, the said damper mating with also elastomer ring damper. Known solutions are going to limit torsional vibration in the area of Its occurrence and this is an  effective action, albeit in case of a sophisticated  construction  which  is undoubtedly a reciprocating diesel engine, where auxiliary drives needed for the fuel injection pump, timing gear, oil or water pump are performed through intermediary of flexible shafts, they do not allow to locate all sources of generation and amplification of said vibration and to control It successfully. The most, important of auxiliary mechanisms in such an engine, decisive for its reliability, is the drive of fuel injection<br>
pump and durability of its gear train. Just torsional vibration in the driving system is frequent<br>
cause of transmission damage, the source of generation of this vibration and its amplification is both main drive shaft, oil pump drive system and influence of other auxiliary mechanisms.<br>
The objective of the invention is a limitation of a torsional vibration in particular drive shafts of engine mechanisms while introducing minimum design changes to this engine. The basis for the adopted solution was determine the effect of localized sources of generation and intensification of this vibration on construction elements of the engine.<br>
To meet the aforementioned objectives the present invention provides for a torsional vibration damping device in the driving apparatus of a reciprocating diesel engine containing auxiliary mechanisms and comprising vibration dampers associated with elements or mechanisms of the engine characterized in that:<br>
-	a vibration damper (3) of the main shaft (4) is mounted on the shaft (4) close to the area of power take off (5),<br>
-	an additional damper (6) is mounted simultaneously on the injection pump coupling (7), said additional damper mating with the vibration damper (3) of the main shaft (4), and<br>
-	a gear oil pump (1) provided with the gears having oblique teeth.<br>
The essence of the torsional vibration damping unit in the driving system of a reciprocating diesel engine according to the present invention is, that the vibration damper of the main shafts is fitted on this shaft near the power take-off area, as well as at the same time on the injection pump coupling an additional damper is mounted, mating with the vibration damper of the main shaft. The solution is also featured by the fact that the multi-section gear oil pump is provided with oblique teeth gears. The known viscous damper is mounted on the engine main shaft, and the known friction damper mounted on the injection pump coupling .<br>
Such a design of the torsional vibration damping unit in the engine driving system allowed to effectively limit the destructive influence of torsional vibration on the driving trasmission of injection pump and on other mechanisms. The torsional vibration damper of main shaft mounted on this shaft close to the area of power take-off is located so that the corresponding harmonic of torsional vibration be of the lowest value in the area of power transmission from the main shaft to auxiliary mechanisms. It permitted to eliminate the need for mounting in this area an additional torsional vibration damper. Interaction of torsional vibration from another source, being a sum of pressure pulses, coming from particular sections of gear oil pump, was eliminated by the use as an element of the unit according to the invention, of the gears with oblique teeth, instead of the used before in the said, pump, gears having straight teeth. A consecutive element of the unit according to the invention is an additional damper mounted on the injection pump coupling, said damper mating with the damper of main shaft vibration which limits torsional<br>
vibration. This co-operation is a result of participation in the amplification of this vibration - a flexible shaft connected through a gear transmission to the drive shaft of said fuel Injection pump.<br>
It turned out that a construction unit developed in this manner, serving for torsional vibration damping in the driving system of a reciprocating diesel engine allowed to increase engine power by about 20% without necessity to increase its overall dimensions and strength parameters, or resistance. As an important result of the invention a reduced frequency of repairs should be pointed out resulting particularly from the extension of failure-free operation of the Injection pump driving transmission.<br>
The object of the Invention in an embodiment is shown on the drawing, in which Fig.1 Illustrates schematic arransement in the engine of particular elements"of the torsional vibration damping unit in the driving system of a reciprocating diesel engine.<br>
A torsional vibration damping unit in the driving system of a reciprocating diesel<br>
engine, according to the invention is used on an engine, in which the drive of<br>
auxiliary mechanisms such as the fuel injection pump, timing gear, oil pump 1 or<br>
water pump is performed through flexible shafts 2. The mechanism of oil pump for<br>
this engine is a multisection gear oil pump 1. A torsional vibration damping unit in<br>
the driving system of the engine is constructed of three, suitably arranged on the<br>
engine, structural members of this unit, accomplishing a common purpose which is<br>
damping said torsional vibration in the driving system of the engine. The first<br>
element of the unit according to the present invention is a torsional vibration damper<br>
3 of the main shaft 4, that is mounted on the shaft 4 near the area of power take-off<br>
5. The vibration damper 3 has been located at the same time close to the area of<br>
maximum amplitude of the determined form of this torsional vibration on the main<br>
shaft 4 of the engine. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, as a<br>
torsional vibration damper 3 the known viscous damper has been employed. The<br>
second element of the unit according to the invention is the use in the multi-section<br>
gear oil pump 1 of gears having oblique teeth, instead of the used until now gears<br>
with straight teeth. The third element of the unit is an additional damper 6 which is<br>
mounted on the injection pump coupling 7 and which is co-operating with the vibration damper 3 of the main shaft 4. In this case as an additional damper 6 in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a known friction damper is used. The first element of the unit according to the invention performs the limitation of torsional vibration amplitude of the engine main shaft 4 in the area of bifurcation 8 of engine auxiliary drives. The second element limits torsional vibration caused by periodical summing of pressure pulses coming from the particular sections of the gear oil pump 1.<br>
The third element reduces to a minimum the amplitude of torsional vibration, taken-over in the area of bifurcation 8 of engine auxiliary drives and then transferred by intermediary of flexible shaft 2 to the drive shaft 9 of injection pump transmission. The co-operation of the said three structural elements of the torsional vibration damping unit according to the invention reduced to a safe ievel the amplitudes of. torsional vibration in the engine driving system, and particularly in" the area of the injection pump drive and thus allowed to achieve the assumed working parameters of the engine. -<br><br><br><br><br><br>
