				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a substrate-attached parallel connector and a connector for use in a substrate. Background Art<br>
As an example of the connector of this kind, the connector for use in a substrate disclosed in the patent document 1 is described below. In the connector, the housing-fixing part is projectingly formed on each side surface of the housing. The housing can be fixed to the substrate by tightening screws into the housing-fixing parts.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-203896 In fixing a plurality of housings, for example, two housings 1 of the above-described connector of this kind to the substrate, with the housings 1 arranged in parallel widthwise, as shown in Fig. 6, the housing-fixing parts 2 are disposed adjacently in the widthwise direction of the connector. The entire widthwise dimension WO of the connector is the sum of 2 X WOI (= widthwise dimension of one housing 1) and the gap W02 between the two housings 1. The widthwise dimension WO of the connector is large. Therefore when there is a dimensional limitation in the widthwise direction of the connector, it is impossible to arrange the housings 1 in parallel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been completed in view of the above-described situation. Therefore it is an object of the present invention to save a space.<br>
As means for achieving the above-described object, the present invention provides a substrate-attached parallel connector in which a housing-fixing part is projected from a side surface of each of a plurality of connector housings fixed to a substrate, with the connector housings arranged in parallel in a widthwise direction thereof. The housing-fixing parts adjacent to each other are disposed in parallel in a longitudinal direction of the connector housings.<br>
It is preferable that the connector housings are fixed to the substrate, with each of the connector housings placed in a predetermined position in the longitudinal direction thereof; and the adjacent housing-fixing parts are disposed on the side surface of each of the connector housings at forward and rearward positions thereof.<br>
It is preferable that the housing-fixing part is disposed on both side surfaces of each of the connector housings; and the housing-fixing parts are disposed at forward and rearward positions.<br>
The present invention provides a connector for use in a substrate in which a housing-fixing part is projected from a side surface of a connector housing; and the housing-fixing part is disposed on both side surfaces of the connector housing; and the<br>
housing-fixing parts are disposed at forward and rearward positions.<br>
The effect of the present invention is described below. The adjacent housing-fixing parts are disposed in parallel at front and rear positions of the connector housing in the longitudinal direction thereof. Thus compared with the connector having the conventional mode in which the housing-fixing parts are disposed in parallel widthwise, it is possible to reduce the widthwise length of the space in which the housings are disposed.<br>
It is possible to reduce the longitudinal dimension of the space in which the housings are disposed.<br>
Both housing-fixing parts are disposed forward and rearward in the longitudinal direction of the connector housing. Therefore it is possible to arrange the adjacent housing-fixing parts forward and rearward by disposing the housings having the same construction at forward and rearward positions in parallel. That is, because the housings having the same construction are used, it is possible to manufacture the connector at a low cost.<br>
When a plurality of the connector housings are arranged widthwise, the adjacent fixing parts can be disposed in parallel at front and rear positions. Therefore compared with the conventional connector having the. conventional mode in which housing-fixing parts are arranged widthwise, it is possible to reduce the widthwise length of the space in which the housings are disposed. Further both housing-fixing parts are disposed forward<br>
and rearward in the longitudinal direction of the connector housing. Therefore it is possible to arrange the adjacent housing-fixing parts  forward and rearward by disposing the housings  having the same construction at forward and rearward positions in parallel. That is, because the housings having the same construction are used, it  is possible to manufacture the connector at a low cost.<br>
The present invention relates to a substrate-attached parallel connector JC) with a housing, said housing including: a terminal-holding pari capable of holding terminal fittings, a hood part projected forward from the terminal-holding part, a pair of side walls extended rearward from the terminal-holding part and the hood part, a pair of housing-fixing parts provided on both side walls respectively, which is formed integrally with the said connector housing, and an alignment plate mounted between both side walls, for arranging the terminal fittings in rows, the said alignment plate being provided with a sectional L-jshaped opening-preventing, portion projected outward and upward beyond a to-be-held portion, in which the said housing-fixing part is projected from a side surface of each of a plurality of connector housings fijced to a substrate, with said connector housings arranged in parallel |in a widthwise direction thereof; wherein said housing-fixing parts adjacent to each other are disposed in parallel in a longitudinal direction of said connector housings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS First Embodiment<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to Figs. 1 through 4. In this embodiment, two connectors C for use in a substrate 10 are fixed to the substrate 10 with the connectors C arranged in parallel in the widthwise direction of the connectors C. A housing-fixing part 25 into which a tapping screw N can be tightened is formed integrally with a connector housing (hereinafter referred to as merely housing) 20 of the connector C for use in the substrate 10. A mating female housing not shown in the drawings can be fitted on the housing 20. In the description made below, the fit-on side of the housing 20 that fits on the mating female housing is set as the "forward" (right-hand side in Fig. 2) side. The vertical direction is as shown in each drawing except Fig. 3.<br>
The housing 20 is made of synthetic resin. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the housing 20 has a terminal-holding part 22 capable of holding terminal fittings 21, a hood part 23 projected forward from the terminal-holding part 22, a pair of side walls 24 extended rearward from the terminal-holding part 22 and the hood part 23, and a pair of housing-fixing parts 25 provided on both side walls 24 respectively. An alignment plate 40 for arranging the terminal fittings 21 in rows can be mounted between both side walls 24 by sandwiching the alignment plate 40 therebetween.<br>
The terminal-holding part 22 is approximately block-shaped.<br>
Terminal insertion holes 26 into which the terminal fittings 21 can be inserted respectively from the rear side of the housing 20 are formed in the longitudinal direction of the housing 20 in penetration through the terminal-holding part 22. The terminal insertion holes 26 are provided in three steps vertically and seven rows widthwise. A portion of the terminal fitting 21 projecting rearward from the terminal-holding part 22 is bent downward to make each terminal fitting 21 L-shaped. The vertical lower portion of each terminal fitting 21 is inserted into a connection hole 11 of the substrate 10 and soldered thereto to form the vertical lower end of the terminal fitting 21 as a substrate-side connection portion 2 la which can be electrically connected to a conductive path (not shown) printed on the substrate 10. The lengths of the terminal fittings 21 to be inserted into the terminal insertion holes 26 are different according to steps on which the terminal fittings 21 are disposed. More specifically, the horizontal and vertical lengths of the terminal fitting 21 disposed at an upper step are set longer than those of the terminal fitting 21 disposed at a lower step. The vertical portion of the terminal fitting 21 disposed at the upper step is disposed rearward from the vertical portion of the terminal fitting 21 disposed at the lower step.<br>
The hood part 23 is projected outward from the periphery of the terminal-holding part 22 and projected forward. Thus the hood part 23 is approximately square pillar-shaped. The hood part 23 accommodates a connector-side connection portion 21b of the<br>
horizontal portion of each terminal fitting 21 projected from the front surface (fit-on surface) of the terminal-holding part 22. The mating female housing can be fitted on the housing 20 from the front side of the housing 20. The connector-side connection portion 21b of the terminal fitting 21 can be electrically connected to a corresponding female terminal fitting (not shown) accommodated inside the female housing. When the housing 20 is mounted on the substrate 10, the hood part 23 projects from the front end of the substrate 10.<br>
Both side walls 24 extend rearward from both sides of the rear end of the terminal-holding part 22 and the hood part 23 . Both side walls 24 are approximately rectangular plate-shaped in a side view. The size of both side walls 24 is so set as to sideways cover almost all of the portion of each terminal fitting 21 projected rearward from the rear surface of the terminal-holding part 22 except the substrate-side connection portion 2la. Thereby both side walls 24 protect the terminal fittings 21. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 3, the upper end position of the side wall 24 is set above the upper end surface of the terminal fitting 21 disposed at the uppermost step, and the rear end position of the side wall 24 is set rearward from the rear end surface of the terminal fitting 21 disposed at the uppermost step. A concave portion 27 open inward in its almost overall length is formed on the inner surface of the lower portion (vertical portion corresponding to housing-fixing part 25) of both side walls 24. A holding portion 28 capable of<br>
unremovably holding the mounted alignment plate 40 is inwardly projected from the concave portion 27 at approximately the center thereof in the longitudinal direction of the housing 20. Each of the side walls 24 has a sectionally approximately L-shaped opening-prevented portion 29 projected inward from the inner surface thereof at a position above the concave portion 27 and projected downward.  A sealing potting material (not shown) is filled into the rear side of the terminal-holding part 22 between both side walls 24, with the terminal fittings 21 mounted in the housing 20. The space between the upper portions of both side walls 24 is open.  Therefore air which is liable to stay in the space discharges easily in the hardening process of the potting material. The alignment plate 40 is flat plate-shaped and mounted on the housing 20 with the longer side of the alignment plate 40 substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the housing 20.  The alignment plate 40 has substantially circular positioning holes 41 formed vertically in penetration therethrough. The substrate-side connection portions 2la of the terminal fitting 21 can be inserted through the positioning holes 41 respectively. The number of the positioning holes 41 is equal to that of the terminal fittings 21.  The positioning hole 41 is disposed in coincidence with the corresponding connection hole 11 formed in penetration through the substrate 10.  Thus the substrate-side connection portions 2la inserted into the positioning holes 41 can be placed in position in the connection holes 11 respectively. The<br>
alignment plate 40 can be mounted between both side walls 24 from below. A to-be-held portion (not shown) which can be locked to the holding portion 28 of the side wall 24 is projected outward from approximately the center of both side surfaces (shorter side) of the alignment plate 40 extending in the longitudinal direction of the housing 20. The alignment plate 40 has a sectionally L-shaped opening-preventing portion 42 projected outward and upward beyond the to-be-held portion.  The opening-preventing portion 42 is disposed forward and rearward from each of the to-be-held portions. When the alignment plate 40 is mounted on the housing 20, the opening-preventing portion 42 enters the concave portion 27 formed on the inner surface of the side wall 24 and engages a portion of a side surface of the opening-prevented portion 29 facing toward the concave portion 27, thereby preventing both side walls 24 from deformably opening outward.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, both housing-fixing parts 25 are projected widthwise (outward) from the outer surface of both side walls 24. A screw-tightening hole 30 into which the tapping screw N can be tightened is formed vertically in penetration through the housing-fixing part 25. As shown in Fig. 4, the housing 20 can be fixed to the substrate 10 by upwardly inserting the tapping screw N into a screw insertion hole 12 formed in penetration through the substrate 10 and by engaging the tapping screw N with the screw-tightening hole 30. Both housing-fixing parts 25 are disposed at the lower end of the side wall 24. The height of each<br>
f the housing-fixing parts 25 is set to about 1/3 (about the same height as the height of the concave portion 27) of that of the side wall 24. The dimensions of the housing-fixing parts 25 projected widthwise are equally set. The housing-fixing part 25 is continuous with the side wall 24 projected rearward from the terminal-holding part 22 so that the position of the housing-fixing part 25 is correspondent with the position at which the housing 20 is fixed to the substrate 10 and the position at which the screw insertion hole 12 is disposed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the housing-fixing parts 25 are disposed front and rear on the outer surface of both side walls 24 in the longitudinal direction of the connector C. In the description made below, to distinguish the left housing-fixing part 25 and the right housing-fixing part 25 from each other and distinguish the left wall 24 and the right wall 24 from each other, a suffix L is attached to the reference numeral denoting the left housing-fixing part and the left wall, whereas a suffix R is attached to the reference numeral denoting the right housing-fixing part and the right wall. On the other hand, when they are not distinguished from each other but generically denoted, a suffix is not attached thereto. More specifically, the rear end of the housing-fixing part 25R disposed on the right wall 24R in Fig. 3 is almost flush with that of the right wall 24R.   On the other hand, the rear end of the housing-fixing part 25L disposed on the left wall 24L is set a little forward from the rear end of the right housing-fixing part 25R.<br>
That is, the housing-fixing part 25L is disposed a little forward from the right housing-fixing part 25R.<br>
Two housings 20 of the connector C, for use in the substrate 10, having the above-described construction are fixed to the substrate 10 by making the front ends of both housings 20 coincident with each other and by arranging both housings 20 in parallel in the widthwise direction of the connector C. In the description made below, to distinguish the left-hand housing 20 and the right-hand housing 20 from each other, the suffix L is attached to the reference numeral denoting the left-hand housing, whereas the suffix R is attached to the reference numeral denoting the right-hand housing. On the other hand, when they are not distinguished from each other but generically denoted, a suffix is not attached thereto.  In the state in which the housings 20 are arranged in parallel, the right-hand housing-fixing part 25LR of the left-hand housing 20L in Fig. 3 and the left-hand housing-fixing part 25RL of the right-hand housing 20R in Fig. 3, namely, the right-hand housing-fixing part 2SLR provided on the outer surface of the side wall 24LR of the left-hand housing 20L and the housing-fixing part 25RL, adjacent to the right-hand housing-fixing part 2SLR, provided on the outer surface of the side wall 24RL of the right-hand housing 2OR are disposed side by side (in confrontation) in the longitudinal direction of the connector C. The widthwise length W of a space in which both housings 20L and 2OR are disposed is almost equal to the distance obtained by subtracting the distance W2 (the<br><br>
distance obtained by subtracting the gap W4 between the projected end of the housing-fixing part 25LR and the side wall 24RL or the gap W4 between the projected end of the housing-fixing part 25RL and the side wall 24LR from the projected length W3 of the housing-fixing part 25LR or the projected length W3 of the housing-fixing part 25RL) between the projected end of the right-hand housing-fixing part 25LR and the projected end of the left-hand housing-fixing part 25RL from the sum of the widthwise length Wl of the left-hand housing 20L and the widthwise length Wl of the right-hand housing R. Each of the four insertion holes 12 is formed in penetration through the substrate 10 at a position corresponding to the position of the screw-tightening hole 30 of each housing-fixing part 25 when the housings 20L and 2OR are arranged in parallel by disposing the housing-fixing parts 25 at predetermined front and rear positions.<br>
The operation of the connector having the above-described construction is described below. In assembling the connector C for use in the substrate 10, after the terminal fittings 21 straight in the horizontal direction are inserted into the corresponding terminal insertion holes 26 from the rear side of the connector housing 20, a portion of each terminal fitting 21 projecting rearward from the terminal-holding part 22 is bent downward almost perpendicularly. After all the terminal fittings 21 are mounted on the housing 20, an operation of mounting the alignment plate 40 on the housing 20 is performed. While the substrate-side<br><br>
connection portion 2 la of each terminal fitting 21 is being inserted into the corresponding positioning hole 41, the alignment plate 40 is mounted between both side walls 24 from below. As a result, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the to-be-held portion is locked to the holding portion 28. Thereby the holding portion 28 unremovably holds the alignment plate 40 from being removed from the housing 20. Further the opening-preventing portion 42 enters the concave portion 27. As a result, the inner surface of the opening-•preventing portion 42 is locked to the inner surface of the opening-prevented portion 29. Thereby it is possible to prevent both side walls 24 from deformably opening outward.<br>
Thereafter an operation of fixing the housing 20 to the substrate 10 is performed. After placing the housing 20 on the substrate 10 and matching the position of the screw-tightening hole 30 of each housing-fixing part 25 with that of the screw insertion hole 12 of the substrate 10, an operation of tightening the tapping screw N inserted into the screw insertion hole 12 is performed by using a power tool such as an impact wrench. In the tightening operation, the tapping screw N moves forward with the tapping screw N cutting into the inner peripheral surface of the screw-tightening hole 30. Thereby screw threads are formed, and the housing 20 is fixed to the substrate 10 at a predetermined position thereof by means of the tapping screw N.<br>
When the two housings 20L and 2OR are fixed to the substrate 10 in the above-described manner, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the<br><br>
front-end and rear-end positions of the housing 20L and those of the housing 2OR are almost flush with each other. The housing-fixing parts 25RL and 2SLR are adjacently arranged front and rear in the longitudinal direction of the housings 20. That is, the housing-fixing parts 25LR and 25RL adjacent to each other are disposed in the space between the side walls 24LR and 24RL opposed to each other, with the housing-fixing parts 25RL and 25LR arranged front and rear. That is, the adjacent housing-fixing parts 2SLR and 25RL are arranged front and rear in the space between opposed side walls 24LR and 24RL. Therefore compared with the conventional connector (see Fig. 6) having the conventional mode in which the housing-fixing parts 2 are arranged widthwise, the entire widthwise length W of the space in which both housings 20L and 20R are disposed can be reduced by the projected dimension W3 of each of the housing-fixing parts 2SLR and 25RL.  In this state, the fit-on surface of the housing 20L and that of the housing 20R for the mating female housing are almost flush with each other.<br>
Thereafter the substrate-side connection portion 2la of the terminal fitting 21 inserted into the connection hole 11 is soldered to the connection hole 11. After the operation of filling the potting material into the rear side of the terminal-holding part 22 between both side walls 24, the mating female housing is fitted in the hood part 23 of each of the housings 20L and 2OR to connect the male and female terminal fittings to each other respectively. As described above, according to the embodiment, the adjacent<br><br>
housing-fixing parts 2 SLR and 25RL are arranged front and rear. Therefore compared with the conventional connector having the conventional mode, it is possible to reduce the entire widthwise length W of the space in which both housings 20L and 20R are disposed. Thereby when there is a dimensional limitation in the widthwise direction of the connector, it is possible to arrange the housings 20L and 20R in parallel.<br>
The housings 20L and 2 OR are fixed to the substrate 10 by placing them in position in the longitudinal direction thereof. The housing-fixing part 25LR is disposed on the side surface of the housing 20L, and the housing-fixing part 25RL is disposed on the side surface of the housing 2 OR by disposing the housing-fixing part 2 SLR forward from the housing-fixing part 25RL in the longitudinal direction of the connector. Therefore compared with a connector in which adjacent housing-fixing parts are arranged forward and rearward by disposing the housings having the same construction forward and rearward, the entire longitudinal dimension of the space in which both housings 20L and 20R are disposed can be reduced.<br>
The housing-fixing part 25L is disposed on one side surface of the housing 20, whereas the housing-fixing part 25R is disposed on the other side surface thereof by differentiating the longitudinal position of the housing- fixing part 25L and the housing-fixing part 25R. Therefore it is possible to arrange the adjacent housing-fixing parts 25LR and 25RL forward and rearward<br>
by disposing the housings 20 having the same construction at forward and rearward positions in parallel. That is, because the housings 20 having the same construction are used, it is possible to manufacture the connector at a low cost. Other Embodiments<br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above with reference to the drawings. For example, the following embodiments are included in the technical scope of the present invention. Further, various modifications of the embodiments can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
(1)	In the above-described embodiment,  the screw-<br>
tightening hole of the housing-fixing part and the screw insertion<br>
hole of the substrate can be matched with each other by fitting<br>
a positioning projection formed on the housing into a positioning<br>
concave portion formed on the substrate.<br>
(2)	In the above-described embodiment, a pair of the<br>
housing-fixing parts are disposed on the side surface of the<br>
connector housing by differentiating the positions of the<br>
housing-fixing parts in the longitudinal direction of the connector<br>
housing. But it is possible to dispose a pair of the housing-fixing<br>
parts by disposing the positions of the housing-fixing parts at<br>
the same position in the longitudinal direction of the connector<br>
housing. More specifically, as shown in Fig.5, it is possible to<br>
form a housing 20A in which a pair of housing-fixing parts 25A is<br>
disposed at the rear end of a side wall 24A and a housing 20B in which a pair of housing-fixing parts 25B is disposed at a position forward from the rear end of a side wall 24B and arrange the three housings 20A, 20B, and 20A in parallel, with the longitudinal positions of the three housing coincident with one another. Thereby the adjacent housing-fixing parts 25A and 25B can be arranged front and rear. In addition, it is possible to form housings of one type of and arrange them in parallel by differentiating the positions thereof in the longitudinal direction thereof.<br>
(3)	The number of the housing-fixing parts and the<br>
configuration thereof are alterable. The housing-fixing part may<br>
be disposed at a position other than the side wall of the housing.<br>
(4)	Four or more housings may be arranged in parallel.<br>
(5)	As the means for tightening a screw into the<br>
housing-fixing part, a bolt and a nut may be used instead of the<br>
tapping screw.<br>
(6)	In the above-described embodiment, the terminal<br>
fittings are soldered to the substrate. But the present invention<br>
is applicable to a connector using a press-fit terminal that is<br>
connected to the substrate by pressing the substrate-side<br>
connection portion of the terminal fitting into the substrate. The<br>
configuration of the terminal fitting is not limited to "L", but<br>
the present invention is applicable to the connector using a<br>
straight-type terminal fitting.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.       A substrate-attached parallel connector (C) with a housing (20), said housing (20) including:<br>
a terminal-holding part (22) capable of holding terminal fittings (21),<br>
a hood part (23) projected forward from the terminal-holding part (21),<br>
a pair of side walls (24) extended rearward from the terminal-holding part and the hood part (23),<br>
a pair of housing-fixing parts (25) provided on both side walls (24) respectively, which is formed integrally with the said connector housing (20), and<br>
an alignment plate (40) mounted between both side walls (24), for arranging the terminal fittings in rows, the said alignment plate (40) being provided with a sectional L-shaped opening-preventing portion (42) projected outward and upward beyond a to-be-held portion,<br>
in which the said housing-fixing part (25) is projected from a side surface of each of a plurality of connector housings (20) fixed to a substrate (10), with said connector housings (20) arranged in parallel in a widthwise direction thereof; wherein said housing-fixing parts (25) adjacent to each other are disposed in parallel in a longitudinal direction of said connector housings (20).<br>
2. A substrate-attached parallel connector (C) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said connector housings (20) are fixed to said substrate, with each of said connector housings (20) placed in a predetermined position in said longitudinal direction thereof; and said adjacent housing-fixing parts (25) are disposed on said side surface of each of said connector housings (20) at forward and rearward positions thereof.<br><br>
3. A substrate-attached parallel connector substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br><br></td>
