In vitro action:<br>
Anti-HCMV    (Anti-Human    Cytomegalovirus)    and    anti-MCMV    (Anti-Murine<br>
Cytomegalovirus) cytopathogenicity tests:<br>
The test compounds were employed as 50 millimolar (mM) solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir served as reference compounds. Following the addition of in each case 2 ixl of the 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 mM DMSO stock solutions to in each case 98 /x of cell culture medium in row 2 A-H, in duplicate determinations, 1:2 dilutions with in each case 50 /xl of medium were prepared up to row 11 of the 96-well plate. The wells in rows 1 and 12 each contained 50/xl of medium. 150 /xl of a suspension of 1 x 104 cells (human lung fibroblasts [HELF]) (row 1 = cell control) or, in rows 2-12, a mixture of HCMV-infected and non-infected HELF cells (M.O.I. = 0.001 - 0.002), i.e. 1-2 infected cells per 1000 non-infected cells, were then pipetted into each of the wells. Row 12 (without substance) served as virus control. The final test concentrations were 250-0.0005 tiM. The plates were incubated at 37°C/5%CO2 for 6 days, i.e. until all cells in the virus controls had been infected (100%cytopathogenic effect [CPE]). The wells were then fixed and stained by adding a mixture of Formalin and Giemsa Stain (30 minutes), washed with doubly distilled water and dried in a drying cabinet at 50°C. The plates were then evaluated visually using an overhead microscope (plaque multiplier from Technomara).<br>
From the test plates, the following data were determined:<br>
CC50 (HELF) = substance concentration in /xM at which, compared to the untreated cell control, no visible cytostatic effects on the cells were noticeable;<br>
EC50 (HCMV) = substance concentration in µM which inhibits the CPE (cytopathic effect) by 50% compared to the untreated virus control; SI (selectivity index) = CC50 (HELF)/EC50 (HCMV).<br>
Compared to the process described above for HCMV, the anti-MCMV test was carried out with the following changes: a cell-free virus suspension was mixed with a concentrated cell suspension (3T3 mouse cells) and incubated for 15 minutes for adsorption of the viruses, and the suspension was then diluted with medium to 1.3 x 105 cells/ml with a final multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of from 0.05 - 0.1, and in each case 150 /il were dispensed into the wells. The incubation time was 5 days.<br>
Representative activity data for the compounds according to the invention are given in Table 1:<br>

In vivo action:<br>
MCMV lethality test:<br>
Animals:<br>
2-3-week old female immunocompetent mice (12-14 g), strain Balb/C AnN or CD1, were purchased from commercial breeders (Bomholtgaard, Iffa, Credo). The animals were not kept under sterile conditions.<br>
Virus cultivation:<br>
Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), Smith strain, was passaged repeatedly in vivo in female CD1 mice. 21 days after intraperitoneal infection (2 x 10 plaque forming units / 0.2 ml/mouse), the salivary glands were removed, taken up in three times the volume of Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) + 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) and homogenized using an Ultraturrax. 10% DMSO v/v were added, 1 ml aliquots were prepared and the virus suspension was stored at -140°C. Following serial dilution of the salivary gland isolate in steps of ten, the titre was determined in cell culture for NIH 3T3 cells after staining with Giemsa stain, and the lethal dose was determined in vivo in 2-3 week old Balb/C mice.<br>
Virus infection of the test animals, treatment and evaluation:<br>
2-3 week old female immunocompetent Balb/C mice (12-14 g) were infected intraperitoneally with 3 x 105 PFU / 0.2 ml/mouse. Starting 6 hours after the infection, the mice were treated orally with substance twice a day (8.00 and 16.00 hours) for a period of 5 days. The dose was 3, 10, 30 or 90 mg/kg of body weight, and the volume administered was 10 ml/kg of body weight. The substances were formulated in the form of a 0.5% strength Tylose suspension, with 2% of DMSO. The placebo-treated control animals die within a period of 4-8 days after the infections. Evaluation was carried out by determining the percentage of surviving animals following treatment with substance, compared to the placebo-treated control group.<br>
HCMV xenograft Gelfoam® model:<br>
Animals:<br>
3-4-week old female immunodeficient mice (16-18 g), Fox Chase SOD or Fox Chase SCID-NOD, were purchased from commercial breeders (Bomholtgaard, Jackson). The animals were kept under sterile conditions (including bedding and feed) in isolators.<br>
Virus cultivation:<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DavisSmith strain, was cultivated in vitro on human embryonal foreskin fibroblasts (NHDF cells). The virus-infected cells were harvested 5-7 days after infection of the NHDF cells with a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I) of 0.01 and stored in the presence of Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) with 10% DMSO, at -140°C. Following serial dilution of the virus-infected cells in steps of ten, the titre was determined on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells, after vital staining with Neutral Red.<br>
Preparation of the sponges, transplantation, treatment and evaluation: Collagen sponges (dimensions lxlxl cm, Gelfoam®; from Peasel &amp; Lorey, order No. 407534; K.T. Chong et al., Abstracts of 39th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1999, p. 439) are initially wetted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the enclosed air bubbles are removed by degassing, and the sponges are then stored in MEM + 10% FCS. 3 hours after the infection, 1 x 106 virus-infected NHDF cells (infection with HCMV-Davis M.O.I = 0.01) are detached and, in 20 [i] MEM, 10% FCS, added dropwise to a moist sponge. 12-13 hours later, the infected sponges are incubated with 5 ng/fx] of basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) in 25 /xl of PBS/0.1% BSA/1 mM DTT. For transplantation, the immunodeficient mice are anesthetized with Avertin, the fur on the back is removed using an electric shaver, the epidermis is opened 1-2 cm and relieved and the moist sponges are transplanted under the skin of the back. The wound caused by the surgery is closed using tissue glue. 24 hours after the transplantation, the mice were treated orally with substance twice daily (8.00 and 16.00 hours) over a period of 8 days. The dose was 10 or 30 mg/kg of body weight, the administration volume was 10 ml/kg of body weight. The substances were formulated in the form of a 0.5% strength Tylose suspension with 2% of DMSO. 10 days after the transplantation and 16 hours after the last administration of substance, the animals were painlessly sacrificed and the sponge was removed. The virus-infected cells were released from the sponge by digestion with collagenase (330 U/1.5 ml) and stored in the presence of IvlEM, 10% foetal calf serum, 10% DMSO at -140°C. Following serial dilution of the virus-infected cells in steps of ten, evaluation was carried out by titre determination on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells, after vital staining with Neutral Red. What was determined was the number of infectious virus particles after treatment with substance, compared to the placebo-treated control group.<br>
The test described below is used to examine the substances according to the invention for potential side-effects with respect to an induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes.<br>
Examination of the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes in human liver cell cultures:<br>
At a cell density of 2.5 x 10 cells, primary human hepatocytes were cultivated between two layers of collagen in 24-well microtitre plates, at 37°C and 5% CO2, for 8 days. The cell culture medium was changed daily.<br>
After 48 hours in culture, the hepatocytes were treated for 5 days with different concentrations of the test substances, compared to the inductors rifampicin (50 piM) and phenobarbital (2 mM), each test being carried out twice. The final concentrations of the test substances were 0.1-10 /xg/ml.<br>
Using the cell cultures, the inductive effect of the test substances on the cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C19 and 3A4 was determined on day 8 by addition of the substrates 7-ethoxyresorufin (CYP1A2), [14C]S-mephenytoin (CYP2B6 and 2C19) and [14C]testosterone (CYP3A4). The inductive potential of the test substances was determined using the measured enzyme activities CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C19 and 3A4 of treated cells compared to untreated cells.<br>
The novel active compounds can be converted in a known manner into the customary formulations, such as tablets including coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients or solvents. In this case, the therapeutically active compound should in each case be present in a concentration from approximately 0.5 to 90% by weight of the total mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient in order to achieve the dosage range indicated.<br>
The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds with solvents and/or excipients, if appropriate using emulsifying agents and/or dispersing<br>
agents, it being possible, for example if the diluent used is water, to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents, if appropriate.<br>
Administrations carried out in a customary manner, preferably orally, parenterally or topically, in particular perlingually or intravenously.<br>
In the case of parenteral administration, solutions of the active compounds using suitable liquid carrier materials can be employed.<br>
In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of intravenous administration to administer amounts of from about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results, and in the case of oral administration the dose is about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight.<br>
In spite of this, it may be necessary, if appropriate, to depart from the amounts mentioned, namely depending on the body weight or on the type of administration route, on the individual response towards the medicament, the manner of its formulation and the time or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be adequate to manage with less than the abovementioned minimum amount, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual administrations over the course of the day.<br>
