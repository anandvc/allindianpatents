This invention relates to a first aid strip and a first aid guaze hat or cap for dressing wounds,sores,warts and the like. It can also be used for dressing localized cuts and bruises, boils, bums, and moles.<br>
A first aid strip known in the art comprises a strip of sterile, nonadherent gauze   pad to one side of which is attached a strip of adhesive tape , The adhesive tape is used to fix the guaze pad over the wound on the skin of a patient. The draw back of this known art is that if some medicine, in the form of jel, ointment or cream is applied to the skin and the first aid strip is applied over the skin, the medicine squishes out / oozes out. As a result, very little to no medicine is left behind over the skin   wound. Further, if there is some localized   swelling or   bulge, associated with the wound or skin condition, such as due to a deep cut, or when there is a wart or a raised mole over the skin , the medicine oozes out even more.<br>
US Pat.No. 4 641 643 discloses a bandage comprising a flexible body having a central opening , a water - repellent layer overlying said body and a removable cover attached to the water-repellent layer.<br>
US Pat. No. 4,909,243 of Frank et al relates to a   dressing comprising a base plate having a through hole, a wound pad inserted in said hole, and means for attaching the pad in the hole.<br>
