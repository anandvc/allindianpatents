				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to innplementing a nnessage service in which user data may be sent between actual signalling, such as a short message service, according to RLC/MAC protocol (Radio Link Control/Media Access Control) in a mobile communication system, and particularly to implementing the message service according to RLC/MAC protocol on an SACCH (Slow Associated Control Channel) which has a DPSCH (Dedicated Physical Sub-CHannel). The SACCH is an associated control channel in which one frame is available for control signalling in the direction in which the assigned channel is carrying traffic.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A mobile communication system generally refers to any telecommunication system which enables wireless communication when a user is located within the service area of the system. Examples of such systems are cellular mobile communication systems, such as the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), or corresponding systems, such, as the PCS (Personal Communication System) or the DCS 1800 (Digital Cellular System for 1800 MHz), third-generation mobile systems, such as the UMTS (Universal Mobile Communication System), and systems based on the above mentioned systems, such as GSM 2- systems and future fourth-generation systems. One typical example of a mobile communication system is a public land mobile network PLMN.<br>
In addition to normal speech and data connections set up on traffic channels in digital mobile communication systems, short digital data messages comprising user data can be transmitted between actual signalling on control and signalling channels of a system. The main reason for this is to avoid frame stealing from the traffic channel. These short digital data messages comprising user data are generally referred to as short messages. In the GSM, control channels used for short message transmissions are the SACCH used for transmission of measurements performed by a mobile station MS during the connection and an SDCCH (Stand alone Dedicated Control Channel) carrying out the actual signalling. If a mobile station has a connection on a traffic channel, short messages are forwarded on the SACCH. otherwise they are forwarded on the SDCCH.<br><br>
In the GSM, short message service has been implemented by using LAPDm (Link Access Protocol for the Dm channel) protocol in the data link layer, i.e. layer 2. The LAPDm provides services to an upper layer, layer 3, via Service Access Points (SAP), which are identified by a Service Access Point Identifier (SAPI). The LAPDm has two different values for the SAPI. Signalling is transferred in SAPI=0 frames using unacknowledged mode operation on the SACCH associated with a traffic channel. Short messages are transferred in SAPI=3 frames using acknowledged mode operation on the SACCH associated with a traffic channel. The LAPDm acknowledged mode operation prioritizes messages from a layer 3 entity, so that if a SAP1=3 frame, i.e. a short message, is waiting for transmission, two SAPI=0 frames are not sent in consecutive frames. It is also ensured that at least one SAPI=0 frame is transmitted after a SAPI=3 frame. In other words, short messages are transmitted on the SACCH associated with a traffic channel by pre-emption of every second signalling frame, i.e. SAPI=0 frame.<br>
However, in a GSM 2+ -system called GERAN (GSM/EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution) Radio Access Network) Release 5, it has been suggested to use the RLC/MAC protocol instead of the LAPDm in order to make the protocol stacks less complicated. One of the problems associated with the replacement of the LAPDm with the RLC/MAC is that there is no support in the RLC/MAC for the pre-emption mechanism illustrated above .<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is thus to provide a method and a system for implementing the method so as to solve the above problem. The object of the invention is achieved by a method and a system which are characterized by what is stated in the independent claims. The preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention is based on realizing the problem and providing the RLC/MAC protocol with a mechanism for pre-empting the signalling frames by defining at least two different identifiers, preferably signalling radio bearer identifiers, the first indicating a signalling message and the second indicating a possible short message and modifying the protocol to pre-empt every second frame with the first identifier.<br>
An advantage of the invention is that it allows transmission of short messages as if the LAPDm were used, and thus there is no need to steal<br><br>
speech frames for the short message transmission, for example. Another advantage is that the physical layer of the SACCH can be kept as it is.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in greater detail by means of preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 illustrates basic parts of a communication system;<br>
Figure 2 shows a protocol architecture according to a first preferred embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart illustrating the operations of the MAC according to the first preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention can be applied to any communication system where short message service, or a corresponding user data message service transmitted between the signalling on signalling channels, is provided by the RLC/MAC protocol. Such systems include the above-mentioned systems, for example. In the following, the invention will be described by using a GERAN system as an example, without restricting the invention thereto.<br>
Figure 1 shows a very simplified network architecture illustrating only basic parts of the communication system 1. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the system 1 comprises network nodes, functions and structures, which need not be described in greater detail here.<br>
A mobile station MS comprises the actual terminal and a detachably connected identification card SIM. also called a subscriber identity module. In this context, the mobile station generally means the entity formed by the subscriber identity module and the actual terminal. The MS can be any equipment capable of communicating in a mobile communication system and supporting the short message service or a corresponding service.<br>
In the example of Figure 1, the system 1 comprises a core network CN and a radio access network GERAN. The GERAN is formed of a group of radio network subsystems (not shown in Figure 1), which are connected to the core network CN via an luinterface 2. The GERAN may be a GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network and the CN may be a GSM/UMTS core network.<br>
For the short message service, the system 1 comprises a short message sen/ice gateway SMSGW having a connection to a short message<br><br>
service centre SMSC. The short message service gateway SMSGW is a common term for a Gateway Mobile Switching Centre for Short Message Service SMS-GMSC and an Interworking Mobile Switching Centre for Short Message Service SMS-IWMSC. The SMS-GMSC receives a short message from the SMSC, requests routing information and delivers the short message through the CN and the GERAN to the mobile station MS. Correspondingly the SMS-IWMSC can receive short messages from a mobile station to be forwarded to the short message service centre SMSC.<br>
Figure 2 shows the lu-interface protocol architecture of the SACCH having the DPSCH according to the first preferred embodiment of the invention. The protocol stack shown in Figure 2 is a protocol stack of a control plane. The corresponding layers and sublayers implemented according to the invention may be used in other interfaces, too. The thick lines between the layers and the sub-layers illustrate possible data flows, and the circles illustrate service access points for peer-to-peer communication.<br>
The lu-interface protocol architecture illustrated in Figure 2 comprises three protocol layers: a physical layer L1, the data link layer L2 and a network layer L3. The data link layer L2 comprises the following sublayers below an RRC (Radio Resource Control) of the layer L3: the radio link control RLC and the medium access control MAC.<br>
The RRC has a control interface (not shown in Figure 2) between the RRC and the RLC. between the RRC and the MAC, and between the RRC and the LI. Tnese interfaces allow the RRC to control the configuration of the lower layers.<br>
The RRC according to the invention provides in the control plane at least two different signalling radio bearers 0, 3, one of which is used among other things for the short message service or a corresponding user data message service and the other is used for signalling. Each signalling radio bearer is identified by a signalling radio bearer identity SRBid, or a corresponding identity which can be mapped one-to-one with an associated signalling radio bearer. In the first and the second preferred embodiment of the invention, SRBid 0 corresponds to the SAPI=0 of the LAPDm. and SRBid 3 corresponds to the SAPI=3 of the LAPDm. The RRC of the invention configures the RLC and the MAC accordingly via the interfaces. The signalling radio bearers may be configured at RRC Connection Setup and remain until the RRC connection is released, for example. Another possibility is that the signalling radio bearers<br><br>
use a predefined default configuration. In other words, the RRC of the invention differs from the prior art RRC in that it reserves at least two signalling radio bearers for a connection.<br>
The RLC provides the upper layer L3 with among other things, acknowledged and unacknowledged data transfer. The RLC of the invention provides acknowledged data transfer for those messages the frame header of which comprises the signalling radio bearer identity used also for short messages, i.e. SRBid 3 frames in the first and the second preferred embodiment of the invention. The unacknowledged data transfer is provided for signalling messages, i.e. SRBid 0 frames in the first and the second preferred embodiment of the invention.An RLC entity 4 is established preferably for each signalling radio bearer, i.e. for each identity, as soon as there is a frame to be sent, and the entity exists preferably until the corresponding DSPCH is released.<br>
The MAC handles the access to and multiplexing onto the physical sub-channels, thus defining among other things logical channels to be used for each radio bearer service. The MAC is also responsible for the MS measurement reporting. For a mobile station MS, there is one MAC entity in the mobile station side and one in the network side. The MAC according to the first preferred embodiment of the invention will pre-empt every second frame having signalling radio bearer identity indicating a signalling message in case there is a frame having the other signalling radio bearer identity. In other words, the MAC provides, in the lumode, priority handling between traffic flows on the basis of the signalling radio bearer identities.<br>
The operation of the MAC protocol in the first preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 3. For the sake of clarity, the figure does not mention the header information and the like added by the MAC to the received information. The functionality described in Figure 2 is performed in each cycle , i.e. in the GERAN something is sent on the SACCH every 480 ms. If there is no measurement reports to be sent, a fill frame is sent. In the first preferred embodiment of the invention, it is assumed that the fill frame is generated at the MAC layer. In some other embodiments of the invention, the fill frame may be generated in the RLC or in the RRC level.<br>
In the first preferred embodiment of the invention there are two inputs in the MAC. input 0 for SRBid 0 frames and input 3 for SRBid 3 frames, and three buffers: one input buffer called InBuffer 0 for SRBid 0 frames, an-<br><br>
oiner inpui Duner caiiea inbuner J Tor bKbid '6 trames, and an output buffer called OutBuffer. InBuffer 3 is a FIFO type buffer.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, the MAC reads input 3 for SRBid 3 frames in step 301, and if input 3 is not empty (step 302), it adds, in step 303, the content of input 3 to InBuffer 3 and reads, in step 304, input 0 for SRBid 0 frames. The MAC will proceed to the same step 304, if input 3 was empty (step 302). If input 0 is not empty (step 305), the MAC adds, in step 306, the content of input 0 to the InBuffer 0. After that the MAC checks, in step 307, if InBuffer 3 is empty. If not, the MAC checks, in step 308, whether the frame sent in the previous cycle was an SRBid 0 frame. If it was, the MAC removes, in step 309, the first element in InBuffer 3 from InBuffer 3 to the OutBuffer and empties, in step 310, InBuffer 0 and sends, in step 311, the content of the OutBuffer on the SACCH. In other words, the pre-emption of an SRBid 0 frame in the first preferred embodiment of the invention occurs in step 310. It is performed by a pre-emption function, which can be called a pre-emptor.<br>
If the frame sent in the previous cycle was not an SRBid 0 frame (step 308), or if InBuffer 3 is empty (step 307), the MAC removes, in step 312, the element in InBuffer 0 from InBuffer 0 to the OutBuffer and sends, in step 311, the content of the OutBuffer on the SACCH.<br>
If input 0 was empty (step 305), the MAC adds, in step 313, a fill frame to InBuffer 0 and continues to step 307 to check if InBuffer 3 is empty. The fill frame is added (step 313) for continuous transmission on the SACCH.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the SRBid 3 frames are not buffered in the MAC. In the embodiment the MAC acknowledges the corresponding RLC entity, when an SRBid 3 frame was sent, and the RLC sends another SRBid 3 frame only after it has received the acknowledgement. The acknowledgement may be performed between steps 309 and 310 of Figure 3, for example.<br>
Thus the MAC according to the first preferred embodiment of the invention discards half of the SRBid 0 frames whenever there is an SRBid 3 frame to be transferred simply by replacing one SRBid 0 frame with an SRBid 3 frame. In other words, the SRBid 3 frame steals bandwidth from SRBid 0 frames on the SACCH.<br>
The MAC according to the second preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes the round robin principles, which are well known by a person skilled in the art. Thus, in the second preferred embodiment of the invention<br><br>
the MAC sends a frame from InBuffer 0, then from InBuffer 3 if it contains a frame, then again a frame from InBuffer 0, etc. In InBuffer 0 there are SRBid 0 frames. In InBuffer 3 there are SRBid 3 frames. The inBuffers are emptied according to the FIFO principle.<br>
Although the invention has been described above by assuming that there are buffers in the MAC, it is obvious to one skilled in the art that the invention can be applied Vi/ithout buffers.<br>
Although the invention has been described by assuming that there are only two signalling radio bearers (and signalling radio bearer identities), the invention can be applied to any pre-emption mechanisms between several radio bearers by pre-empting the low priority frame by one with higher priority.<br>
In addition to prior art means, the system implementing the functions of the present invention and the network nodes of this system comprise means for providing pre-emption of user data sent in signalling channels. More precisely, the network nodes may comprise means for implementing the functions described above. The current network nodes comprise processors and memory, which can be utilized in the functions according to the invention. All changes necessary for implementing the invention can be made as added or updated software routines, by means of application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and/or programmable circuits, such as EPLD, FPGA.<br>
It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that as the technology advances, the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways. The invention and its embodiments are not limited to the examples described above but may vary within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
