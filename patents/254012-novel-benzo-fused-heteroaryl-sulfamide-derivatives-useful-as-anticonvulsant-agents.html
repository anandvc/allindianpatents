CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application<br>
60/604,134, filed on August 24, 2004, which is incorporated by reference herein<br>
in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel benzo-fused heteroaryl<br>
sulfamide derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their<br>
use in the treatment of epilepsy and related disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Epilepsy describes a condition in which a person has recurrent seizures<br>
due to a chronic, underlying process. Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon<br>
rather than a single disease entity, since there are many forms and causes of<br>
epilepsy. Using a definition of epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures,<br>
the incidence of epilepsy is estimated at approximately 0.3 to 0.5 percent in<br>
different populations throughout the world, with the prevalence of epilepsy<br>
estimated at 5 to 10 people per 1000.<br>
An essential step in the evaluation and management of a patient with a<br>
seizure is to determine the type of seizure that has occurred. The main<br>
characteristic that distinguishes the different categories of seizures is whether<br>
the seizure activity is partial (synonymous with focal) or generalized.<br>
Partial seizures are those in which the seizure activity is restricted to<br>
discrete areas of the cerebral cortex. If consciousness is fully preserved during<br>
the seizure, the clinical manifestations are considered relatively simple and the<br>
seizure is termed a simple-partial seizure. If consciousness is impaired, the<br>
seizure is termed a complex-partial seizure. An important additional subgroup<br>
comprises those seizures that begin as partial seizures and then spread<br><br>
diffusely throughout the cortex, which are known as partial seizures with<br>
secondary generalization.<br>
Generalized seizures involve diffuse regions of the brain simultaneously<br>
in a bilaterally symmetric fashion. Absence or petit mal seizures are<br>
characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural<br>
control. Atypical absence seizures typically include a longer duration in the<br>
lapse of consciousness, less abrupt onset and cessation, and more obvious<br>
motor signs that may include focal or lateralizing features. Generalized Tonic-<br>
clonic or grand mal seizures, the main type of generalized seizures, are<br>
characterized by abrupt onset, without warning. The initial phase of the seizure<br>
is usually tonic contraction of muscles, impaired respiration, a marked<br>
enhancement of sympathetic tone leading to increased heart rate, blood<br>
pressure, and pupillary size. After 10-20 s, the tonic phase of the seizure<br>
typically evolves into the clonic phase, produced by the superimposition of<br>
periods of muscle relaxation on the tonic muscle contraction. The periods of<br>
relaxation progressively increase until the end of the ictal phase, which usually<br>
lasts no more than 1 min. The postictal phase is characterized by<br>
unresponsiveness, muscular flaccidity, and excessive salivation that can cause<br>
stridorous breathing and partial airway obstruction. Atonic seizures are<br>
characterized by sudden loss of postural muscle tone lasting 1-2 s.<br>
Consciousness is briefly impaired, but there is usually no postictal confusion.<br>
Myoclonic seizures are characterized by a sudden and brief muscle contraction<br>
that may involve one part of the body or the entire body.<br>
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) have been widely used in<br>
medicine, mainly as antiglaucoma and antisecretory drugs or diuretic agents,<br>
and are valuable compounds. However, systemic antiglaucoma agents (such<br>
as acetazolamide) possess potentially unwanted side-effects including<br>
paresthesias, nephrolithiasis and Weight loss. Topiramate is a well known<br>
anticonvulsant drug that possesses single digit micromolar carbonic anhydrase<br>
inhibition, which is suspected as the cause of paresthesias noted by some<br>
patients taking topiramate.<br><br>
There remains a need to provide an effective treatment for epilepsy and<br>
related disorders, and preferably treatment which does not have the associated<br>
side-effects attributable to carbonic anhydrase inhibition.<br>

Additional embodiments of the present invention, include those wherein<br>
the substituents selected for one or more of the variables defined herein (i.e.<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, X-Y and A) are independently selected to be any individual<br>
substituent or any subset of substituents selected from the complete list as<br>
defined herein.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention are compounds of formula (I)<br>
wherein the MES activity, measured according to the procedure described in<br>
Example 17, at 300 mg/kg dosing is greater than or equal to 3/5 mice at any<br>
time interval. In another embodiment of the present invention are compounds<br>
of formula (I) wherein the MES activity, measured according to the procedure<br>
described in Example 17, at 100 mg/kg dosing is greater than or equal to 3/5<br>
mice at any time interval.<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention are as listed in<br>
Table 1 and 2, below.<br><br><br><br>
As used herein, "halogen" shall mean chlorine, bromine, fluorine and<br>
iodine.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" whether used alone or as part of a<br>
substituent group, include straight and branched chains. For example, alkyl<br>
radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-<br>
butyl, pentyl and the like. Unless otherwise noted, "C1-4alkyl" means a carbon<br>
chain composition of 1-4 carbon atoms.<br><br>
When a particular group is "substituted" (e.g., alkyl, phenyl, aryl,<br>
heteroalkyl, heteroaryl), that group may have one or more substituents,<br>
preferably from one to five substituents, more preferably from one to three<br>
substituents, most preferably from one to two substituents, independently<br>
selected from the list of substituents.<br>
With reference to substituents, the term "independently" means that<br>
when more than one of such substituents is possible, such substituents may be<br>
the same or different from each other.<br>
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative<br>
expressions given herein are not qualified with the term "about". It is<br>
understood that whether the term "about" is used explicitly or not, every<br>
quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also<br>
meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably<br>
be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due<br>
to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term "leaving group" shall<br>
mean a charged or uncharged atom or group which departs during a<br>
substitution or displacement reaction. Suitable examples include, but are not<br>
limited to, Br, CI, I, mesylate, tosylate, and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, the position at which the R1 substituent is<br>
bound will be determined by counting around the core structure in a clockwise<br>
manner beginning at the X-Y positions as 1,2 and continuing from thereon as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
Should the X-Y substituent be -CH=CH-CH-, then the X-Y group will be<br>
counted as 1, 2, 3 and counting then continued clockwise around the core<br>
structure as previously noted.<br>

Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to<br>
the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt<br>
formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid<br>
and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds<br>
may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and<br><br>
T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient<br>
subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
The present invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing one or more compounds of formula (I) with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of the<br>
compounds of the invention described herein as the active ingredient can be<br>
prepared by intimately mixing the compound or compounds with a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding<br>
techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending upon the<br>
desired route of administration (e.g., oral, parenteral). Thus for liquid oral<br>
preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and<br>
additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives,<br>
stabilizers, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations, such as<br>
powders, capsules and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches,<br>
sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like. Solid oral preparations may also be coated with substances such<br>
as sugars or be enteric-coated so as to modulate major site of absorption. For<br>
parenteral administration, the carrier will usually consist of sterile water and<br>
other ingredients may be added to increase solubility or preservation.<br>
Injectable suspensions or solutions may also be prepared utilizing aqueous<br>
carriers along with appropriate additives.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or<br>
more compounds of the present invention as the active ingredient is intimately<br>
admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration,<br>
e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in<br>
oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed.<br>
Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and<br>
solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols,<br><br>
flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral<br>
preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, caplets, gelcaps and<br>
tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents,<br>
granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the<br>
most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical<br>
carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or<br>
enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually<br>
comprise sterile water, through other ingredients, for example, for purposes<br>
such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included. Injectable<br>
suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers,<br>
suspending agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder,<br>
injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient<br>
necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g.,<br>
tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from<br>
about 50-100 mg and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.01-20.0<br>
mg/kg/day, preferably from about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day, more preferably from<br>
about 0.5-5 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 1.0-5.0 mg/kg/day. The<br>
dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the<br>
patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being<br>
employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may<br>
be employed.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as<br>
tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or<br>
suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector<br>
devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal<br>
administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively,<br>
the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-<br>
monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound,<br>
such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for<br><br>
intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the<br>
principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums,<br>
and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present<br>
invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to<br>
these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active<br>
ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms<br>
such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is<br>
then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing<br>
from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The<br>
tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged<br>
action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an<br>
outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the<br>
former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which<br>
serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component<br>
to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of<br>
material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl<br>
alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention<br>
may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous<br>
solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored<br>
emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or<br>
peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable<br>
dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic<br>
and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.<br><br>
The method of treating epilepsy and related disorders described in the<br>
present invention may also be carried out using a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising any of the compounds as defined herein and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may contain between about<br>
0.1 mg and 1000 mg, preferably about 50 to 500 mg, of the compound, and may<br>
be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected.<br>
Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not<br>
limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners,<br>
preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration<br>
include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including<br>
immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), granules,<br>
and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixers, emulsions, and<br>
suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions,<br>
emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered<br>
in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided<br>
doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present<br>
invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable<br>
intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery<br>
system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than<br>
intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and<br>
coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-<br>
lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth<br>
or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate,<br><br>
sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without<br>
limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms in suitably flavored suspending or dispersing agents such<br>
as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-<br>
cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and<br>
solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment of epilepsy or related disorders is required.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from<br>
0.01 to 1,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the<br>
compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01,0.05,<br>
0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0,10.0,15.0,25.0, 50.0,100, 150, 200, 250, 500 and 1000<br>
milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage<br>
to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied<br>
at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per<br>
day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.5 to about 10.0 mg/kg of body weight<br>
per day, most preferably, from about 1.0 to about 5.0 mg/kg of body weight per<br>
day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the<br>
particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br><br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that, both in vivo and in vitro trials<br>
using suitable, known and generally accepted cell and / or animal models are<br>
predictive of the ability of a test compound to treat or prevent a given disorder.<br>
One skilled in the art will further recognize that human clinical trails<br>
including first-in-human, dose ranging and efficacy trials, in healthy patients<br>
and / or those suffering from a given disorder, may be completed according to<br>
methods well known in the clinical and medical arts.<br>

in Vivo Assay: Maximal Electroshock Test (MES)<br>
Anticonvulsant activity was determined using the MES test, run<br>
according to the procedure described in detail below. Swinyard EA, Woodhead<br>
JH, White HS, Franklin MR. Experimental selection, quantification, and<br>
evaluation of anticonvulsants. In Levy RH, et al., eds. Antiepileptic Drugs. 3rd<br>
ed. New York: Raven Press, 1989:85-102<br>
CF-1 male albino mice (25-35g) were fasted for 16 hours before testing.<br>
Mice were randomly selected into control and test groups, with the animals<br>
dosed with vehicle or test compound, at varying concentrations, respectively.<br><br>
On the study date, at 30 minutes prior to shock, the mice were orally dosed<br>
with vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) or test compound (100-300 mg/kg).<br>
Seizures were induced by trans-corneal electric shock using a 60-Hz<br>
alternating current, 50 mA, delivered for 0.2 sec. The mice in the test groups<br>
were subjected to electrical stimulus at time intervals between 15 minutes and<br>
4 hours following administration of test compound. The shock resulted in an<br>
immediate full body tonic extension. The test was complete when the entire<br>
course of the convulsion has been observed (typically, less than 1 minute after<br>
electrical stimulation), and the mice were then immediately euthanized by<br>
carbon dioxide inhalation.<br>
Abolition of the full body tonic extensor component of the seizure was<br>
taken as the endpoint of the test. Absence of this component indicated that the<br>
test compound had the ability to prevent the spread of seizure discharge<br>
through neural tissue. The ED50 value of the test compound (calculated when<br>
appropriate) was the calculated dose required to block the hind limb tonic-<br>
extensor component of the MES-induced seizure in 50% of the rodents tested.<br>
A probit analysis was used to calculate the ED50 and 95% fiducial limits (FL).<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention were tested according<br>
to the procedure described above, with results as listed in Table 3 below. Results<br>
are listed as (number of mice with full body tonic extension prevented) / (total<br>
number of mice tested) (@ a given time).<br><br><br><br>
