				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SULFURM-CONTAINING ORGANOSILICON<br>
COMPOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a process for the production of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by phase transfer catalysis techniques. The process involves<br>
reacting the phase transfer catalyst with the aqueous phase components of the process to<br>
create an intermediate reaction product, which is reacted with a silane compound to form a<br>
product mixture, and then the organosilicon compound is separated from the product mixture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are useful as reactive coupling agents in<br>
a variety of commercial applications. In particular, sulfur containing organosilicon<br>
compounds have become essential components in the production of tires based on rubber<br>
vulcanates containing silica. The sulfur containing organosilicon compounds improve the<br>
physical properties of the rubber vulcanates containing silica resulting in automotive tires<br>
with improved abrasion resistance, rolling resistance, and wet skidding performance. The<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds can be added directly to the rubber vulcanates<br>
containing silica, or alternately, can be used to pre-treat the silica prior to addition to the<br>
rubber vulcanate composition.<br>
[0003] Numerous methods have been described in the art for the preparation of sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds. For example, U.S. 5,399,739 by French et al. describes<br>
a method for making sulfur-containing organosilanes by reacting an alkali metal alcoholate<br>
with hydrogen sulfide to form an alkali metal hydrosulfide, which is subsequently reacted<br>
with an alkali metal to provide an alkali metal sulfide. The resulting alkali metal sulfide is<br>
then reacted with sulfur to provide an alkali metal polysulfide which is then finally reacted<br>
with a silane compound of the formula X-R2-Si(R1)3, where X is either chlorine or<br>
bromine to produce the sulfur-containing organosilane.<br>
[0004] U.S. Patent Nos. 5,466,848, 5,596,116, and 5,489,701 describe processes for the<br>
preparation of silane polysulfides. The '848 patent process is based on first producing<br>
sodium sulfide by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with sodium ethoxylate. The sodium<br>
sulfide is then reacted with sulfur to form the tetrasulfide, which is subsequently reacted with<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane to form 3, 3'-bis (triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide. The '116<br>
patent teaches a process for the preparation of polysulfides, without the use of hydrogen<br>
sulfide, by reacting a metal alkoxide in alcohol with elemental sulfur, or by reacting sodium<br>
metal with elemental sulfur and an alcohol, with a halohydrocarbylalkoxysilane such as<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane. The '701 patent claims a process for the preparation of silane<br>
polysulfides by contacting hydrogen sulfide gas with an active metal alkoxide solution and<br>
subsequently reacting the reaction product with a halohydrocarbylalkoxysilane such as<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 5,892,085 describes a process for the preparation of high purity<br>
organosilicon disulphanes U.S. Patent No. 5,859,275 describes a process for the production<br>
of bis (silylorganyl) polysulphanes. Both the '085 and '275 patents describe anhydrous<br>
techniques involving the direct reaction of a haloalkoxysilane with a polysulphide.<br>
[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,752 teaches a process for producing sulfur-containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by reacting sulfur, an alkali metal, and a halogenalkoyxsilane in the<br>
absence of a solvent or in the presence of an aprotic solvent.<br>
[0007] Most recently, U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,524 describes a method for preparing short chain<br>
polysulfide silane mixtures of the formula (RO)3SiC3H6SnC3H6Si(RO)3 having a distribution<br>
where n falls in the range of 2.2 = n = 2.8. The '524 method reacts metal polysulfides,<br>
typically Na2Sn with a halogenopropyltrialkoxysilane having the formula<br>
(RO)3SiC3H6X wherein X is a halogen, in alcohol solvent.<br>
[0008] Alternative processes for the preparation of sulfur-containing organosilanes have<br>
been taught in the art based on the use of phase transfer catalysis techniques. Phase transfer<br>
catalysis techniques overcome many of the practical problems associated with the<br>
aforementioned prior art processes for producing sulfur-containing organosilicon compounds.<br>
Many of these problems are related to the use of solvents. In particular, the use of ethyl<br>
alcohol can be problematic because of its low flash point. Additionally, it is difficult to<br>
obtain and maintain anhydrous conditions necessary in many of the aforementioned prior art<br>
processes on an industrial scale.<br>
[0009] Phase transfer catalysis techniques for producing sulfur-containing organosilicon<br>
compounds are taught for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,405,985, 5,663,396, 5,468,893, and<br>
5,583,245. While these patents teach new processes for the preparation of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds using phase transfer catalysis, there still exist many practical<br>
problems with the use of phase transfer techniques at an industrial scale. For example, there<br>
is a need to control the reactivity of the phase transfer catalyst in the preparation of sulfur-<br>
containing organosilanes so as to provide efficient, yet safe reactions that can be performed<br>
on an industrial scale. Furthermore, there is a need to improve the final product stability,<br>
appearance and purity. In particular, the phase transfer catalysis process of the prior art<br>
results in final product compositions containing high quantities of un-reacted sulfur species'.<br>
These un-reacted sulfur species can precipitate in stored products with time causing changes<br>
in product sulfide distribution.<br>
[0010] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for<br>
the production of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer<br>
catalysis techniques.<br>
[0011] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for producing<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer catalysis techniques that<br>
result in a final product composition of greater stability, purity, and appearance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] The present invention provides a process for the production of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by phase transfer catalysis techniques. The process involves<br>
reacting a phase transfer catalyst with the aqueous phase components of the process to create<br>
an intermediate reaction product, which is then reacted a silane compound to form a product<br>
mixture. The sulfur containing organosilicon compound is then separated from the product<br>
mixture.<br>
[0013] The improvement of the present invention is characterized by adding the phase<br>
transfer catalyst to the aqueous phase prior to mixing the aqueous phase with the silane<br>
compound for the reaction and by additional separation steps. The improvements of the<br>
present invention result in a process that is controlled and operable on an industrial scale and<br>
produces a final product composition of greater purity and appearance.<br>

to form a product mixture<br>
(C) separating the organosilicon compound from the product mixture<br>
[0015] Examples of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds which may be prepared in<br>
accordance with the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,405,985, 5,663,396,<br>
5,468,893, and 5,583,245, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The preferred sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds which are prepared in accordance with the present<br>
invention are the 3,3'-bis(trialkoxysilylpropyl) polysulfides. The most preferred compounds<br>
are 3,3'-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide and 3,3'-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide.<br>
|0016] The first step of the process of the present invention involves reacting sulfur, a<br>
phase transfer catalyst, a sulfide compound having the formula M2Sn or MHS, where H is<br>
hydrogen, M is ammonium or an alkali metal, n is the same as above, and water to form an<br>
intermediate reaction product. The sulfur used in the reaction of the present invention is<br>
elemental sulfur. The type and form are not critical and can include those commonly known<br>
and used. An example of a suitable sulfur product is 100 mesh refined sulfur powder from<br>
Aldrich, Milwaukee WI.<br>
[0017] Sulfide compounds of the formula M2Sn or MHS are also added to the aqueous<br>
phase in the first step of the present invention. M represents an alkali metal or ammonium<br>
group and H represents hydrogen. Representative alkali metals include potassium, sodium,<br>
rubidium, or cesium. Preferably M is sodium. Generally, MHS compounds are used<br>
preferentially when the average value of n in the resulting product formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-<br>
AIk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m is desired to be 2. Suitable examples of the MHS compound<br>
include, but are not limited to NaHS, KHS, and NH4HS. When the sulfide compound is an<br>
MHS compound, NaHS is preferred. Suitable examples of the NaHS compound include, but<br>
are not limited to NaHS flakes (containing 71.5 - 74.5% NaHS) and NaHS liquors<br>
(containing 45 - 60 % NaHS) from PPG of Pittsburgh, PA. M2Sn compounds are used<br>
preferentially when the average value of n in the resulting product formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-<br>
Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m is desired to be 4. Suitable examples of compounds of M2Sn<br>
include, but are not limited to; Na2S, K2S, Cs2S, (NH4)2S, Na2S2, Na2S3, Na2S4, Na2S6, K2S2<br>
K2S3, K2S4, K2S6, and (NH4)2S2, Preferably the sulfide compound is Na2S. A particular<br>
preferred sulfide compound is sodium sulfide flakes (containing 60 - 63% Na2S) from PPG<br>
of Pittsburgh, PA.<br>
[0018] The amount of sulfur and sulfide compound used in the process of the present<br>
invention can vary, but preferably the molar ratio of S/ M2Sn or S/MHS ranges from 0.3 to<br>
5. The molar ratio of sulfur/sulfide compound can be used to affect the final product<br>
distribution, that is the average value of n in the formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-<br>
SiRm(OR)3-m, When the average value of n is desired to be 4 in the product formula, (RO)3-<br>
mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred range for the ratio of sulfur/sulfide compound<br>
is from 2.7 to 3.2. When the average value of n is desired to be 2 in the product formula,<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred range for the ratio of sulfur/sulfide<br>
compound is from 0.3 to 0.6.<br>
[0019] The phase transfer catalysts operable in the present invention are the quaternary<br>
onium cations. Examples of the quaternary onium cations that can be used as phase transfer<br>
catalysts in the present invention are described in U.S. 5,405,985, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. Preferably, the quaternary onium cation is tetrabutyl ammonium<br>
bromide or tetrabutyl ammonium chloride. The most preferred quaternary onium salt is<br>
tetrabutyl ammonium bromide. A particularly preferred quaternary onium salt is tetrabutyl<br>
ammonium bromide (99%) from Aldrich Chemical of Milwaukee, WI.<br>
[0020] The amount of the phase transfer catalyst used in the process can vary. Preferably<br>
the amount of phase transfer catalyst is from 0.1 to 10 weight %, and most preferably from<br>
0.5 to 2 weight % based on the amount of silane compound used.<br>
[0021] The phase transfer catalyst, sulfur, and sulfide compounds are mixed in water and<br>
allowed to react to form an intermediate reaction product. The amount of water used to<br>
create the intermediate reaction product can vary, but is preferably based on the amount of<br>
the silane compound used in the process. Water can be added directly, or indirectly, as some<br>
water may already be present in small amounts in other starting materials. For purposes of<br>
the present invention, it is preferable to calculate the total amount of water present, that is,<br>
accounting for all water added either directly or indirectly. Preferably, the total amount of<br>
water used to create the intermediate reaction product is 1 to 100 weight % of the silane<br>
compound used, with a range of 2.5 to 70 weight % being more preferred. Most preferred is<br>
a range of 20 to 40 weight % of water used for the intermediate reaction product based on the<br>
amount of silane compound used.<br>
[0022] The reaction of the first step involves mixing sulfur, a sulfide compound, a phase<br>
transfer catalyst, and water together in a reaction vessel. The reaction of the first step can be<br>
conducted at a variety of temperatures, but generally in the range of 40 - 100°C. Preferably,<br>
the reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from 65 - 95 °C. Generally, the first step<br>
can be conducted at various pressures, but preferably the first step reaction is conducted at<br>
atmospheric pressure. The time needed for the reaction of the first step to occur is not<br>
critical, but generally ranges from 5 to 30 minutes.<br>
[0023] The second step of the process of the present invention involves reacting the<br>
intermediate reaction product with a silane compound of the formula;<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X<br>
Each R is an independently selected hydrocarbon group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Thus, examples of R include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl.<br>
Preferably, R is a methyl or ethyl group. In the formula (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X, m is an integer<br>
and can have a value from 0 to 2. Preferably, m is equal to 0. Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon<br>
group containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Alk can be for example; ethylene, propylene,<br>
butylene, or isobutylene. Preferably Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon group containing 2 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, and most preferably, Alk is a propylene group. X is a halogen atom selected<br>
from chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Preferably X is chlorine. Examples of silane compounds<br>
that may be used in the present invention include chloropropyl triethoxy silane, chloropropyl<br>
trimethoxy silane, chloroethyl triethoxy silane, chlorobutyl triethoxy silane,<br>
chloroisobutylmethyl diethoxy silane, chloroisobutylmethyl dimethoxy silane,<br>
chloropropyldimethyl ethoxy silane. Preferably, the silane compound of the present<br>
invention is chloropropyl triethoxy silane (CPTES).<br>
[0024] The silane compound, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X, can be reacted directly with the<br>
intermediate reaction product described above, or alternatively, the silane compound can be<br>
dispersed in an organic solvent. Representative examples of organic solvents include toluene,<br>
xylene, benzene, heptane, octane, decane, chlorobenzene and the like. When an organic<br>
solvent is used, the preferred organic solvent is toluene.<br>
[0025] When conducting the process of the present invention, preferably the silane<br>
compound is reacted directly with the intermediate reaction product described above.<br>
[0026] The amount of the silane compound (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X used in the process of the<br>
present invention can vary. An example of a suitable molar range includes from 1/10 to 10/1<br>
based on the amount of sulfide compound used. When the average value of n is desired to be<br>
4 in the product formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the silane compound (RO)3-<br>
mRmSi-Alk-X is generally used from 2.0 to 2.10 in molar excess of the M2Sn sulfide<br>
compound, with a range of 2.01 to 2.06 being the most preferable. When the average value<br>
of n is desired to be 2 in the product formula,<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the silane compound (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X is<br>
preferably used from 1.8 to 2.1 in molar excess of the MHS sulfide compound, with a range<br>
of 1.9 to 2.0 being the most preferable.<br>
[0027] When conducting the second step of the present invention, preferably the silane<br>
compound is added to the intermediate reaction product at such a rate so as to maintain a<br>
constant reaction temperature. The reaction of the second step of the present invention can be<br>
conducted at a variety of temperatures, but generally is conducted in the range of 40 - 100°C.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from 65 - 95°C. Generally, the<br>
second step can be conducted at a various pressures, but preferably the second step reaction is<br>
conducted at atmospheric pressure. The time needed for the reaction of the second step to<br>
occur is not critical, but generally ranges from 5 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
[0028] The process of the present invention produces organosilicon compounds that are<br>
dialkyl polysulfides, containing on average 2 -6 sulfur atoms, via a phase transfer catalyzed<br>
reaction of an aqueous phase containing a polysulfide and a silane compound. A typical<br>
reaction of the present invention is exemplified according to the following equation;<br>
Na2S + 3 S + 2 Cl(CH2)3Si(OEt)3 ? (EtO)3Si(CH2)3SSSS(CH2)3Si(OEt)3 + 2 NaCI<br>
In a typical run, stoichiometric amounts of sulfur, Na2S are added to water, heated to 65°C<br>
and mixed until all solids are dispersed. An aqueous solution of the phase transfer catalyst is<br>
added. The organosilane compound is then added to the aqueous solution at such a rate to<br>
control the exothermic reaction, and maintain a temperature in the range of 40 to 110°C.<br>
Preferably the reaction temperature is maintained at 60 to 95°C. The reaction progress can be<br>
monitored by the consumption of the organosilane starting material. The precipitation of a<br>
salt, for example sodium chloride if Na2S is used as a starting reactant, also indicates<br>
progression of the reaction. The amount of catalyst and reaction temperature affects the<br>
reaction time necessary for completion.<br>
[0029] At the end of the reaction, a product mixture is produced containing an organic<br>
phase, an aqueous phase, and possibly precipitated solid materials that can include salts<br>
formed during the reaction. The organic phase contains the organosilane compound. The<br>
present invention provides for processing steps to enhance the separation of the organosilane<br>
compound from the product mixture. Furthermore, the present invention provides additional<br>
processing steps that provide for an organosilane compound having enhanced purity.<br>
[0030] Step (C) of the present invention involves separating the organosilicon compound<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m from the product mixture. This separation can be the<br>
phase separation of the organic and aqueous phase, resulting directly from the reaction from<br>
steps (A) and (B) above. Alternatively, if precipitated salts are formed during the reaction,<br>
the salts can be separated first by a filtering process or decanting method prior to the phase<br>
separation. Preferably, water or a dilute acidic solution is added to the product mixture prior<br>
to separation. The addition of water or a dilute acidic solution can enhance the phase<br>
separation by dissolving some or all of the precipitated salts. The amount of water or dilute<br>
acidic solution that is added during this step can vary from 10 to 50% based on the weight of<br>
the amount of silane compound used, preferably, the amount of water or dilute acidic solution<br>
added is from 20 to 40 wt% based on the amount of the silane compound used, and most<br>
preferably from 25 to 35. When a dilute acidic solution is used, it can be any of the common<br>
acids, for example HC1, HNO3, H2SO4, or the like, having a normal (N) concentration of<br>
0.0000001 to 5, preferably 0.01 to 1. The dilute acidic solution can also be prepared by the<br>
addition of a chlorosilane to water. Examples of chlorosilanes that can be used to create the<br>
dilute acidic solution include trichlorosilane, trichloromethylsilane, dimethyldichlorosilane,<br>
dimethylchlorosilane, trimethylchlorosilane . When a chlorosilane is used to create the dilute<br>
acidic solution, preferably .5 to 10 wt % chlorosilane can be used to prepare the dilute acidic<br>
solution, with 1 to 5 wt % being the most preferred. When a chlorosilane is used to create the<br>
dilute acidic solution, the chlorosilane is preferably trimethylchlorosilane.<br>
[0031] Following the addition of water or a dilute acidic solution to the product mixture,<br>
the organosilicon compound is isolated from the product mixture by phase separating the<br>
organic phase and aqueous phase. The organic phase containing the organosilicon compound<br>
can be further subjected to a drying step. One example of the drying step can be to treat the<br>
organic phase under vacuum to remove any volatile organic materials present along with any<br>
residual water that may be present. This drying step can involve, for example, heating the<br>
organic phase to a temperature of 20 to 160°C under a reduced pressure of 5 to 35 mm Hg<br>
(0.67 to 4.65 kPa), preferably the conditions are 90 to 120°C at 5 to 25 mm Hg (0.67 to 3.33<br>
kPa). Alternatively, the drying step of the organic phase can involve the use of a thin film<br>
stripper to remove volatile organics materials and residual water content in the organic phase.<br>
Yet another technique for the drying step of the organic phase can be to contact the organic<br>
phase containing the organosilicon compound with a desiccant material. The desiccant<br>
material can be any solid material known in the art to remove trace quantities of water in<br>
organic phases. These include known ionic hygroscopic materials like sodium sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, and the like, or silicate based materials such as zeolites, silica,<br>
aluminasilicates, and the like. The preferred desiccant material is either sodium sulfate or<br>
magnesium sulfate, with sodium sulfate being the most preferred.<br>
[0032] The dried organic phase can be subjected to additional steps according to the present<br>
invention that result in further improvements of the organosilicon compound final purity and<br>
appearance. The organic phase containing the organosilicon compound can be cooled to a<br>
temperature below 15°C. This cooling step results in the precipitation of un-reacted sulfur<br>
and sulfur compounds. Preferably, the organic phase containing the organosilicon compound<br>
is cooled to a temperature in the range of -20 to 30°C, and most preferably to a temperature<br>
in the range of -20 and -10°C. The precipitated un-reacted sulfur and sulfur compounds can<br>
then be separated, for example by filtration, from the organic phase containing the<br>
organosilicon compound. The present inventors have found that removing un-reacted sulfur<br>
and sulfur compounds minimizes or eliminates further precipitation of sulfur and un-reacted<br>
sulfur compounds with time. As a result, the long-term storage stability of the organosilicon<br>
compound is enhanced by producing a composition that does not change with time, or results<br>
in a product composition containing solid precipitates.<br>
[0033] The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention. These<br>
examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claims herein.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
[0034] The following general procedure was used to conduct runs 1-6, shown in Table I.<br>
A 100 ml 3 necked round bottom flask, fitted with a condenser, nitrogen sweep, and magnetic<br>
stirrer, was charged with varying amounts of Na2S, sulfur, (as shown in Table I) and 6.25 g of<br>
water. The contents were heated to 70°C while stirring under nitrogen. After the Na2S and<br>
sulfur dissolved, varying amounts of the catalyst (Table I) tetrabutylammonium bromide<br>
obtained from Aldrich of Milwaukee, WI, were added and allowed to mix for 10 minutes.<br>
Then, a solution containing 25 g of chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTES) and 1.25 g of<br>
toluene (used for a reference standard for gas chromatographic analysis) was added dropwise<br>
at such a rate to maintain the reaction temperature in the range of 70 - 80 °C. The reaction<br>
was monitored by gas chromatographic methods and allowed to proceed until all the CPTES<br>
had been consumed or until no further change in its concentration was observed. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 25°C and then 14.2 g<br>
of water were added to the reaction mixture to dissolve precipitated sodium chloride. The<br>
reaction mixture was then phase separated. The resulting organic phase was then treated with<br>
sodium sulfate and filtered. The resulting filtrate was then cooled and stored at a temperature<br>
of-13°C, and subsequently filtered again.<br>
[0035] The distribution of the various sulfur containing organosilicon compounds were<br>
analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Typical run conditions for HPLC<br>
analysis were as follows: 8-9 drops of the reaction sample were diluted in 8.5 g of<br>
cyclohexane, which was then filtered through a 0.2 urn PTFE membrane (e.g. PURADISC™<br>
25TF of Whatman®) into a vial, a 10 µl sample of the filtrate was injected via an<br>
autosampler into a HPLC system (e.g. Hewlett-Packard 1050). The sample was fractionated<br>
on a Lichrosorp RP18 column (e.g. Alltech Assoc, Inc; 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 10 urn) using a<br>
mixture of 96 % acetonitrile and 4 % tetrahydrofurane (vol/vol) as mobile phase. The<br>
fractions were investigated via UV-absorption detector using 254 nm as the appropriate<br>
excitation wavelength. Different UV-sensitivities of every single sulfide species were<br>
averaged by division of the respective peak area through specific, empirically evaluated,<br>
response factors* (RF) listed below that reflect the hyperchromy with every sulfur atom in<br>
the chain and elemental sulfur.<br>
HPLC Response Factors.<br>
*As reported by H.-D. Luginsland, "Reactivity of the Sulfur Functions of the Disulfane Silane TESPD and the<br>
Tetrasulfane Silane TESPT"; Rubber Division, American Chemical Society; Chicago, IL, April 13-16, 1999.<br>
[0036] The products were consistent with the general formula (EtO)3Si-CH2CH2CH2 -Sn-<br>
CH2CH2CH2-Si(OEt)3. The percentage of each discrete organosilicon sulfur species in the<br>
composition, as represented by the value of Sn in the above formula, is shown in Table II.<br>
[0037] The results from Runs 1-6 show the effects of using various stoichiometric ratios of<br>
CPTES and sodium sulfides based on sodium and sulfide, effect of catalyst concentration,<br>
reaction temperature, and mole ratio of S/S-2.<br>
a) based on amount of CPTES; b) approximate run time from start of CPTES addition until cooling cycle; c)<br>
Na2S flakes containing 56.20 wt% Na2S and 5.20 wt% NaSH; d) Na2S flakes containing 59.75 wt% Na2S and<br>
0.26 wt% NaSH; e) reaction was stopped incompletely because of high peak value of ethanol in gas<br>
chromatogram; f) washed with brine; g) washed with 1.0-normal HC1 solution.<br>

crystals, but contained small black to green particles)<br>
Example 2<br>
[0038] The following general procedure was used to conduct runs 7-15, as summarized in<br>
Table III. A 1 liter or 1.5 liter 3 necked reactor, fitted with a condenser, internal<br>
thermometer, one baffle, nitrogen sweep, and stirrer, was charged with varying amounts of<br>
Na2S, sulfur, (as shown in Table III) and 112.5 g of water. Contents were mixed at a constant<br>
stirring speed of 300 rpm and heated to 70°C under nitrogen. After the Na2S and sulfur<br>
dissolved, varying amounts of the catalyst, tetrabutylammonium bromide obtained from<br>
Aldrich of Milwaukee, WI, were added and allowed to mix for 10 minutes. Then, CPTES<br>
(amount as shown in Table III) was added dropwise at such a rate to maintain the reaction<br>
temperature. The reaction was monitored by gas chromatographic methods and allowed to<br>
proceed until all the CPTES had been consumed or until no further change in its<br>
concentration was observed. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was<br>
allowed to cool to 25°C and then 137.5 g of water was added to the reaction mixture to<br>
dissolve precipitated sodium chloride. The reaction mixture was then phase separated. The<br>
resulting organic phase was filtered then treated with sodium sulfate and re-filtered. The<br>
resulting filtrate was then cooled and stored at a temperature of-13°C, and subsequently<br>
filtered again.<br>
[0039] The final organic product from these runs was analyzed for the various polysulfide<br>
organosilicon compounds by HPLC. The products were consistent with the general formula<br>
(EtO)3Si-CH2CH2CH2 -Sn- CH2CH2CH2-Si(OEt)3 . The percentage of each discrete<br>
organosilicon sulfur species in the composition, as represented by the value of Sn, is shown in<br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE<br>
A 1-1-reactor, equipped with mechanical stirrer, 1 baffle, condenser, dropping<br>
funnel, and thermometer, was loaded at 75°C with 121.50 g of flaked disodium sulfide<br>
(59.75% Na2S, 0.26% NaHS), 89.82 g of elemental sulfur and 112.50 g of water. The<br>
mixture was vigorously stirred until all salts were dissolved. Then, 463.50 g of<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane were added to the aqueous solution. Then, 28.8 g of a 25%<br>
aqueous catalyst solution (7.20 g of tetrbutyl ammonium bromide in 21.6 g of water) were<br>
added in one portion, the mixture was stirred, and the reaction temperature uncontrollably<br>
increased to 103°C within 7 minutes causing the water to reflux. The heating circulator<br>
had to be cooled by addition of ice, and with this action, the reaction temperature could<br>
be lowered to 80°C within the next-8-10 minutes. After the decrease of the exotherm, the<br>
mixture was stirred at a temperature of 78°C, and the reaction progress was followed by<br>
gas chromatography analysis until the chloropropyltriethoxysilane reached a stable level,<br>
in 2Vi hours. The mixture was cooled to 15°C, and 135.00 g of water were added to<br>
dissolve the formed salts. The aqueous phase was separated (433.07 g). The remaining<br>
organic phase was also drained off and filtered in a Biichner funnel. The filter residue<br>
consisted of 7.14 g of green and black particles, and 501.33 g of a clear, light orange<br>
liquid were collected. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed an average<br>
sulfur rank of 3.86. Quantitative gas chromatography analysis showed 1.46% un-reacted<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
This comparative example demonstrates that the order of addition of the phase<br>
transfer catalyst and the silane is important. In examples 1 and 2 provided hereinbefore,<br>
the order of addition is as follows:<br>
A) sulfur + sulfide + catalyst ? intermediate<br>
B) intermediate + silane ? organosilicon product<br>
C) separation<br>
The process results in a controllable exotherm while the organosilicon product is<br>
forming. This is not the case when the addition steps according to the comparative<br>
example are followed :<br>
A) Sulfur + sulfide + silane<br>
B) A + catalyst ? uncontrollable exotherm<br>
When the process of the comparative example is followed, an uncontrollable<br>
exotherm results. This uncontrollable exotherm makes the process of the comparative<br>
example unfeasible on an industrial scale. However, when the process of examples 1 and<br>
2 are used, the exotherm can be controlled while producing the desired organosilicon<br>
product.<br>
