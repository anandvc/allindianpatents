				<td>COMPOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of compounds believed to be inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), compositions comprising said compounds, methods of synthesis and uses for such compounds in treating and/or preventing various diseases, including those mediated by SCD enzyme, such as diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, skin disorders such as acne, diseases or conditions related to cancer and the treatment of symptoms linked to the production of the amyloid plaque-forming A|342 peptide such as Alzheimer's disease and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acyl desaturase enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds in fatty acids derived from either dietary sources or de novo synthesis in the liver. Mammals synthesise at least three fatty acid desaturases of differing chain length that specifically catalyze the addition of double bonds at the delta-9, delta-6, and delta-5 positions. Stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) introduce a double bond in the C9-C10 position of saturated fatty acids. The preferred substrates for the enzymes are palmitoyl-CoA (16:0) and stearoyl-CoA (18:0), which are converted to palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1) and oleoyl-CoA (18:1), respectively. The resulting mono-unsaturated fatty acids may then be employed in the preparation of phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters, in vivo.<br>
A number of mammalian SCD genes have been cloned. For example, two genes have been cloned from rats (SCD1, SCD2) and four SCD genes have been isolated from mice (SCD1, 2, 3 and 4). While the basic biochemical roles of SCD has been known in rats and mice since the 1970's (Jeffcoat, R ef a/., Elsevier Science (1984), Vol 4, pp. 85-112; de Antueno, RJ, Lipids (1993), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 285-290), it has only recently been directly implicated in human diseases processes.<br>
A single SCD gene, SCD1, has been characterized in humans. SCD1 is described in Brownlie ef a/, WO 01/62954. A second human SCD isoform has been identified, and because it bears little sequence homology to known mouse or rat isoforms it has been named human SCD5 or hSCD5 (WO 02/26944).<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that inhibition of the activity of SCD<br>
in vivo can be used to ameliorate and/or treat one or more diseases such as dyslipidemia,<br>
hypoalphalipoproteinemia,	hyperbetalipoproteinemia,	hypercholesterolemia,<br>
hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, obesity, Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia, metabolic syndrome; other cardiovascular diseases<br>
e.g. peripheral vascular disease, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, thrombosis; hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other diseases related to accumulation of lipids in the liver.<br>
An SCD-mediated disease or condition also includes a disorder of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) disorder, or a skin disorder, including but not limited to eczema, acne, psoriasis, keloid scar formation or prevention, diseases related to production or secretions from mucous membranes, such as monounsaturated fatty acids, wax esters, and the like (US2006/0205713A1, WO2007/046868, WO2007/046867). SCD has been shown to play a physiological role in cholesterol homeostasis and the de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol esters, triglycerides and wax esters required for normal skin and eyelid function and therefore may be useful in the treatment of acne and other skin conditions (Makoto et al. J of Nutrition (2001), 131(9), 2260-2268, Harrison et al. J of Investigative Dermatology (2007) 127(6), 1309-1317).<br>
An SCD-mediated disease or condition also includes but is not limited to a disease or condition which is, or is related to cancer, neoplasia, malignancy, metastases, tumours (benign or malignant), carcinogenesis, hepatomas and the like (US2006/0205713A1, WO2007/046868, WO2007/046867). Recently, SCD-1 has been identified as playing a role in human tumor cell survival and therefore has potential as an anticancer target (Morgan-Lappe et al. 2007 Cancer Res. 67(9) 4390-4398).<br>
It has been shown that overexpression of Steroyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in human cells in culture leads to a specific increase in the production of the amyloid plaque-forming Aß42 peptide, and conversely, that reductions in SCD activity in human cells in culture leads to a specific decrease in the production of Aß42. Therefore, SCD inhibitors may also be useful for treating, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing the progression of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or dementia associated with Down Syndrome (DS) and other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the formation or accumulation of amyloid plaques comprising Aß42 (US2007/0087363A1; Myriad Genetics).<br>

In another aspect of the invention, the solvent used is water and the solvate may also be referred to as a hydrate.<br>
Solvates of compounds of formula (I) which are suitable for use in medicine are those wherein the solvent is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, solvates having non-pharmaceutically acceptable solvents are within the scope of the present invention, for example, for use as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Prodrugs of the compounds of formula (I) are included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "prodrug" means a compound which is converted within the body, e.g. by hydrolysis in the blood, into its active form that has medical effects. Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987 and in D. Fleishner, S.-Ramon and H. Barba "Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs", Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130. Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (I) in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by modifying functional groups in a way such that the nnodification is cleaved in vivo yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs may include, far example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxyl or amine groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy or amine groups. Thus, representative examples of prodrugs include (but are not limited to) phosphonate, carbamate, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of hydroxy and amine functional groups of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Phosphonates, acetates, benzoates and carbamates may be active in their own right and/or   be   hydrolysable   under   in   vivo   conditions   in   the   human   body.   Suitable<br>
pharmaceutically  acceptable in vivo hydrolysable ester groups include those which break down readily in the human body to leave the parent acid or its salt. A phosphonate is formed by reaction with phosphorous (phosphonic) acid, by methods well known in the art. For example, phosphonates may be derivatives such as RP(O)(OR)2 and the like. A acetate is an ester of acetic acid. A benzoate is an ester of benzenecarboxylic acid. A carbamate is an ester of carbamic acid.<br>

Creams, lotions, or ointments, may be prepared as rinse-off or leave-on products, as well as two stage treatment products for use with other skin cleansing or managing compositions. The compositions can be administered as a rinse-off product in a higher concentration form, such as a gel, and then a leave-on product in a lower concentration to avoid irritation of the skin. Each of these forms is well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, such that dosages may be easily prepared to incorporate the pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
Ointments are hydrocarbon-based semisolid formulations containing dissolved or suspended drugs. Creams and lotions are semi-solid emulsion systems and the term is applied both to water/oil or oil/water. Gel formulations are semi-solid systems in which a liquid phase is trapped in a polymeric matrix.<br>
By way of non-limiting example, the ointments may contain one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, for example, white soft paraffin or other mineral waxes, liquid paraffin, non-mineral waxes, long chain alcohols, long chain acids and silicones. The ointment may contain in addition to the hydrophobic carriers some hydrophillic carriers selected from, for example, propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol in combination with an appropriate surfactant/co-surfactant system. The carrier compositions of the creams or lotions are typically based on water, white soft paraffin and an appropriate surfactant/co-surfactant system,  in combination with other carriers/components selected from, for<br>
example,     propylene    glycol,    butylene    glycol	glycerinemonostearate,     PEG-<br>
glycerinemonostearate, esters such as C12-15 alkyl benzoate, liquid paraffin, non-mineral waxes, long chain alcohols, long chain acids silicones, non-silicone polymers. The gels may by way of example be formulated using isopropyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol and water with a gelling agent such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, suitably in combination with minor components, for example one or more of butylene glycol and a wetting agent such as a poloxamer.<br>
An ointment, cream, lotion, gel, and the like, can further comprise a moisturizing agent. The moisturizing agent can be a hydrophobic moisturizing agent such as ceramide, borage oil, tocopherol, tocopherol linoleate, dimethicone or a mixture thereof or a hydrophilic moisturizing agent such as glycerine, hyaluronic acid, sodium peroxylinecarbolic acid, wheat protein, hair keratin amino acids, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also comprise conventional additives and adjuvants for dermatological applications, such as preservatives, acids or bases used as pH buffer excipients and antioxidants.<br>
The present invention encompasses administration via a transdermal patch or other forms of transdermal administration. Suitable formulations for transdermal administration are known in the art, and may be employed in the methods of the present invention. For example, suitable transdermal patch formulations for the administration of a pharmaceutical compound are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4, 460,372 to Campbell et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,996 to Kwiatek et a!., U. S. Pat. No. 4,624,665 to Nuwayser, U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,941 to Eckert et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5, 223,261 to Nelson et al.<br>
One suitable type of transdermal patch for use in the methods of the present invention encompasses a suitable transdermal patch includes a backing layer which is non-permeable, a permeable surface layer, an adhesive layer substantially continuously coating the permeable surface layer, and a reservoir located or sandwiched between the backing layer and the permeable surface layer such that the backing layer extends around the sides of the reservoir and is joined to the permeable surface layer at the edges of the permeable surface layer. The reservoir contains a compound of formula (I) or pharmaceutically  acceptable salt thereof, alone or in combination, and is in fluid contact with the permeable surface layer. The transdermal patch is adhered to the skin by the adhesive layer on the permeable surface layer, such that the permeable surface layer is in substantially continuous contact with the skin when the transdermal patch is adhered to the skin. While the transdermal patch is adhered to the skin of the subject, the compound of formula (I) or pharmaceutically  acceptable salt thereof contained in the reservoir of the transdermal patch is transferred via the permeable surface layer, from the reservoir, through the adhesive layer, and to the skin of the patient. The transdermal patch may optionally also include one or more penetration-enhancing agents in the reservoir that<br>
enhance the penetration of the compound of formula (I) or pharmaceutically  acceptable salt thereof through the skin.<br>
Examples of suitable materials which may comprise the backing layer are well known in the art of transdermal patch delivery, and any conventional backing layer material may be employed in the transdermal patch of the instant invention.<br>
Suitable penetration-enhancing agents are well known in the art as well. Examples of conventional penetration-enhancing agents include alkanols such as ethanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol, and the like, hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexaue, isopropylbenzene; aldehydes and ketones such as cyclohexanone, acetamide, N, N-di(lower alkyl)acetamides such as N, N-diethylacetamide, N, N-dimethyl acetamide, N-(2-hydroxyethyl) acetamide, esters such as N, N-di-lower alkyl sulfoxides; essential oils such as propylene glycol, glycerine, glycerol monolaurate, isopropyl myristate, and ethyl oleate, salicylates, and mixtures of any of the above.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example potato starch; or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives, such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example — almond oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and, if desired, conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled/extended release of the active compound.<br>
Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, e.g. cocoa-butter or other glyceride.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing<br>
solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.<br>
Advantageously, agents such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilised powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
The compositions may contain from 0.1% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by weight, of the active ingredient, depending on the method of administration. Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50-500 mg of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 to 3000 mg per day, for instance 1500 mg per day depending on the route and frequency of administration. Such a dosage corresponds to 1.5 to 50 mg/kg per day. Suitably the dosage is from 5 to 20 mg/kg per day.<br>
It will be recognised by one of skill in the art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of a compound of the invention will be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated, the form, route and site of administration, and the particular mammal being treated, and that such optimums can be determined by conventional techniques. It will also be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the number of doses of a compound of the invention given per day for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment determination tests.<br>
The invention also extends to novel intermediates disclosed herein, used in the preparation of compounds of formula (I) or salts thereof.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ASSAY<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be analysed in vitro for SCD activity using an assay based on the production of [3H]H2O, which is released during the enzyme-catalyzed generation of the monounsaturated fatty acyl CoA product. The assay is performed in a 96-well filtration plates. The titrated substrate used in the assay is the [9,10-3H] stearoyl Coenzyme A. After incubation for 6 minutes of SCD-containing rat microsomes (2 ug protein) and substrate (1 µM), the labelled fatty acid acyl-CoA species and microsomes are absorbed with charcoal and separated from [3H]H2O by centrifugation. The formation of [3H]H2O is used as a measure of SCD activity. Compounds at concentrations starting at 10 µM to 0.1 nM or vehicle (DMSO) are preincubated for 5 minutes with the microsomes before addition of the substrate. The concentration-responses are fitted with sigmoidal curves to obtain IC50 values.<br>
All of the synthetic Example compounds 1-93 tested by the above described in vitro assay for SCD activity were found to exhibit an average plC50 value of greater than 5.5.<br>
