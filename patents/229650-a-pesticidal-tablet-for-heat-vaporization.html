The     present    invention    relates    to     a    pesticidal    tablet    for<br>
heat-vaporization.<br>
Background Arts<br>
In a known tablet for controlling mosquitoes by electric heating, a pesticide is supported on a fibrous or porous carrier, and the tablet is usually heated at from about 140 to 200^ to control pests such as mosquitoes and the like. Though it is easy to use the tablet for controlling mosquitoes by electric heating, control of vaporization of the pesticide is very difficult, consequently, a product which can effectively control pests for a long period of time has not been developed yet now.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a pesticidal tablet for heat-vaporization that is effective for controlling pests for a long period of time.<br>
Summary of the Invention The present invention solves the above-mentioned problems and provides a pesticidal tablet for he at-vaporization in which a plate carrier containing a pesticide is coated with pesticide non-permeable layer having at least one aperture, wherein said aperture exists only on one surface of the pesticidal tablet and the aperture ratio is 0.1 to 10% of said surface. Further, the present invention also provides a method for controlling pests comprising heating the present tablet for vaporization.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The plate carrier in the present tablet for heat-vaporization can retain a pesticide and can suitably vaporize the pesticide by heating.<br>
As such a carrier, fibrous carries and porous carries and the like are exemplified.<br>
Typical examples of the fibrous carrier include natural fibers such as pulp, cellulose and cotton, synthetic fibers such as polyester and acrylic resin, inorganic fibers such as glass fiber and asbestos, and examples of the porous<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
carrier include porous inorganic substances such as diatomaceous earth, porcelain such as unglazed pottery, porous resins such as foamed urethane and foamed polypropylene.<br>
The present tablet generally installed in a heating apparatus, therefore, a carrier usually used is in the form of flat plate, and the size thereof varies depending on the heating apparatus, and for example, carriers of about 2cm (longitudinal) X about 3cm (transverse) X about 3mm (thickness) are used.<br>
Examples of the pesticide for heat-vaporization in the present tablet include pyrethroid compounds suitable for heat-vaporization, and preferable are tetrafluorohenzyl ester compounds given by the general formula (1):<br><br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, methyl group, methoxy group or methoxymethyl group, and X and Y independently represent a hydrogen atom, chlorine atom or methyl group.<br>
Said tetrafluorohenzyl ester compounds are, for example, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl 3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, 2,3,5,6'tetrafluoro-4-methylbenzyl 3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, 2,3,5,6'tetrafluorobenzyl 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, 2,3,5,6-tetrafiuoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)-2,2-<br>
dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, 2,3,5J6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxybenzyl 3_(1* propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxybenzyl 3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate.<br>
The content of the pesticide in the plate carrier is suitably set by the quality of the carrier, objective pesticidal effect, effective period of time, kind of the pesticide and the like, and usually 0.001 to Ig per 1cm3 of the carrier.<br>
The plate carrier comprises the present pesticide and optionally solvent, coloring agent, antioxidant, synergist, stabilizer, perfume and so on.<br><br>
Examples of the solvent include normal paraffins, isoparaffms, naphthenes, esters, ketones, ethers and alcohols. They may be used solely or as a mixture of two or more.<br>
Examples of the coloring agent include anthraquinone type blue<br>
dyestuffs	such	as	1,4-dibutylaminoanthraquinone,	1,4-<br>
diisopropylaminoanthraquinone,	l,4-bis(2,6-diethyl-4-methylphenylamino)<br>
anthraquinone, l-methylamino-4-o-tolylaminoanthraguinone, 1-methylamino-<br>
4-m-tolylaminoanthraquinone	and	l-methylamino-4-p-<br>
tolylaminoanthraquinone. They may be used solely or as a mixture of two or more.    Further, they may be used as a mixture with the other color dyestuff.<br>
Examples of the anti-oxidant include phenol type antioxidants such as dibutylhydroxytoluene, butylhydroxyanisole, 2,2-methylenebis(4-methyI-6*tert-butylphenol) and 2,6-drtert-butyl-4-methylphenol.<br>
Examples of the synergist include bis(2,3,3,3-tetrachloropropyl) ether (S-421), N-(2-ethylhexyl)bicycb[2.2.l]hept-5 ■ene-2,3"dicarboxyimide (MGK' 264) and a -[2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethoxy]-4,5-methylenedioxy2-propyltoluene (PBO).<br>
Examples of the stabilizer include UV absorbents such as benzotriazole type UV absorbents and benzophenone type UV absorbents.<br>
For supporting the pesticide on the plate carrier, the earner may be impregnated with a solution containing the pesticide and so on.<br>
The present tablet has a structure in which the plate carrier is coated with the pesticide non-permeable layer. The pesticide non-permeable layer is a layer not allowing substantial permeation of the vapor of the pesticide. Substantial no permeation means that in use of the present tablet, the pesticide in an amount exerting an influence on pesticidal effect is not allowed to permeate. Generally, this layer has non-permeability of such level that when the present tablet is wholly coated with the non-permeable layer, a pesticidal effect test explained in Test Example 1 is conducted, and observation is effected for 30 minutes, then, no mosquito knocked down is recognized at all. The non-permeable layer preferably has such heat resistance that at temperatures (for example, about 50 to 200*0) at which the present tablet is used, exposure of the plate carrier by breakage, melting and the like is not caused during the use period (for example, about 100 hours or more).<br><br>
The non-permeable layer is, for example, film and sheet prepared with the material which the vapor of the pesticide does not essentially permeate. Examples of the material include metals such as iron, nickel, chromium, zinc, molybdenum, titanium, copper, aluminum, tin, lead, silver, platinum and gold," and polymers such as polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene), polyacrylonitrile, copolymers (e.g. ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene -aery lie acid copolymer, ethylene"metacrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-methyl metacrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer), polyamide (e.g. nylon), polyimide, polyesters (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate), polyethers (e.g. polyphenylene oxide, polyether sulfone) and fluorinated resins (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene).<br>
The non-permeable layer can be a multiple material mixed by the above-mentioned material or laminated material having two or more layers. Further, the non-permeable layer may be laminated by one or more layers those are highly permeable of the pesticide for the purpose of providing strength, heat-resistance, adhesiveness and so on.   In view of heat-resistance and easy-processing, preferred are multiple materials consisting of a metal layer such as aluminum, copper and stainless, and a resin layer such as polyolefm (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene), polyacrylonitrile, copolymers (e.g. ethylene-vinyl acetate, ethylene-acrylic acid, ethylene-metacrylic acid, ethylene-methyl acrylate, ethylene-methyl metacrylate, ethylene-ethyl acrylate), polyamide (e.g. nylon), polyimide, polyester (e.g. polyethylene tetrephthalate, polybutylene tetrephthalate) and polyether (e.g. polyphenylene oxide, polyether sulfone).    More preferred are multiple substances consisting of an aluminum layer and a resin layer of polyolefin (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene), polyamide (e.g. nylon), polyimide, polyester (e.g. polyethylene tetrephthalate, polybutylene tetrephthalate) or polyether (e.g. polyphenylene oxide, polyether sulfone).<br>
In the present invention, "coated" includes not only a condition in which a coating material (the non-permeable layer) closely adheres to and coats the surface of a coating object (the plate carrier), but also a condition in which a coating material coats a coating object at a some (for example, about 1 cm or less) interval.   The clearance between the plate carrier and the non-permeable<br><br>
layer is usually 5mm or less, preferably, 3mm or less.<br>
The thickness of the non-permeable layer is not particularly restricted, and usually from 0.0001 to 5mm, preferably from 0.001 to 2mm.<br>
In the present tablet, the non-permeable layer coating the plate carrier has an aperture, and through this aperture, the pesticide can be vaporized. This aperture exists only on one surface of the present tablet, the aperture ratio is from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 6%, based on the area of the surface.    One surface of the present tablet herein referred to indicates either of two opposed surfaces having large areas among surfaces of the present tablet.    Usually, when the present tablet is placed on a plane surface, the outermost part viewed vertically from right above is regarded as outline, and surface parts forming the inner side of the outline (coated layer and aperture) can be used as one surface of the present tablet, and the total area of parts (area of the non-permeable layer part and area of aperture) can be used as the area of one surface of the present tablet.   When the present tablet is, for example, in the form of hexahedron of 3cm (longitudinal)  X  5cm (transverse) X  1mm (thickness), the area of one surface of the present tablet is 15cm2.   In the case of the present tablet obtained by placing the plate carrier of 2.2cm (longitudinal) X  3.5cm (transverse)  X 2mm (thickness) in a bag made of the non-permeable layer of 2.5cm (longitudinal)  X 3.8cm (transverse) {here, one surface of the bag has a given aperture) and closely sealing the mouth of the bad by heat-seal and soon, the area of one surface of the present tablet is 9.5cm2.<br>
The condition in which the non-permeable layer has an aperture is, for example, a condition in which the non-permeable layer has deficient portion, a condition in which the coating non-permeable layer has many small (e.g. about 0.01 to 0.1mm) pores or a condition in which the coating non-permeable layer is partially substituted by a permeable layer for the pesticide.<br>
The method for coating the plate carrier with the non-permeable layer is a method for adhering to each surface of the plate carrier by heat-seal, ultrasonic seal, high frequency seal, adhesives and like for film or sheet of the non-permeable layer; a method for forming a resin film on the surface of the plate carrier by a usual resin coating procedure such as dip-coating, spray-coating, paint-brushing and so on; a method for charging the plate carrier<br>
H<br><br>
in a bag of the non-permeable layer and closing the mouth of the bag by heat-seal, ultrasonic seal, high frequency seal, adhesives and so on.<br>
Listed as the method of producing the present tablet are a method in which a layer having a given deficient portion, a layer having small pores, a layer in which the above-mentioned deficient portion is coated with the pesticide permeable layer, and the like are used as the non-permeable layer, and coating is conducted so that the above-mentioned part exists only on one sui-face of the present tablet, a method in which the whole surface of the plate carrier is coated with the non-permeable layer having no aperture, then, a given portion of the non-permeable layer is removed (peeling, cutting), or holed, of a given portion is removed, then, the pesticidal tablet is pasted so that it covers the removed portion, and other methods.<br>
When the present tablet is installed in a heating apparatus, the pesticide can be conveniently handled without causing adhesion to finger and the like of the pesticide by providing the above-mentioned non-permeable layer poition.<br>
Before heating of the present tablet for vaporization, or in the case of cessation of use, the aperture of the non-permeable layer may be closed with a seal non-permeable for the pesticide, for preventing unnecessaiy vaporization of the present pesticide and decreasing possibility of adhesion of pesticide to handle and the like. Further, the above-mentioned seal preferably has an adhesive layer on which one surface pasting/peeling can be conducted easily so as to enable repeated attaching and detaching.<br>
Particularly before initiation of the first use, it is preferable that the aperture of the non-permeable layer is coated with a seal non-permeable for the pesticide, and in initiation of use, this seal is peeled, broken, cut out and so on.<br>
It is preferable that the present tablet has an indicator means for giving notice of decreasing or lowering of pesticidal effect to users, as it is a tablet for vaporization suitable for use for a long period of time.   Examples of the indicator means include the followings.<br>
■ To make a plate carrier hold coloring agent and observe fading, (cf. JP sho 46-24277B)<br>
•To make a plate carrier hold a volatile acid or base or pH indicator and observe fading, (cf. JP sho 56-53461A)<br><br>
' To make a carrier hold a volatile acid or base or pH indicator, adhere the carrier to the surface of the present substance for vaporization and observe fading, (cf. JP sho 56-53461A)<br>
*	To make a plate carrier hold an electron-providing coloring organic compound<br>
and auxiliary and observe fading, (cf. JP sho 63-60901A)<br>
' To make a carrier hold an electron-providing coloring organic compound, volatile-adjusting agent and auxiliary, adhere the carrier to the surface of the present substance for vaporization and observe fading, (cf. JP sho 63-60901A)<br>
*	To adhere an indicator, in which sheet or resin having an original color portion<br>
of lower refractive index on a part or all of the one surface is impregnated with<br>
a solvent, to the surface of the tablet for vaporization and observe fading, (cf. JP hei 8-73301A)<br>
■ To use sheet or resin having an original color portion of lower refractive index on a part or ail of the one surface, and observe fading, (cf. JP hei 8-73301A)<br>
The present tablet can be heated at from about 50°C to about 200^ by a heating means to control pests.<br>
The controlling can be effected by heating the present tablet from a surface opposed to the surface having an aperture (from the lower surface, when a surface having an aperture is the upper surface) for vaporization.<br>
Regarding specific heating of the present tablet for vaporization by a heating apparatus, in pest control using the present tablet, it is usual that, when a surface in contact with (or, adjacent to) a heater surface of a heating apparatus is the lower surface, the apparatus is installed so that a surface having an aperture of the present tablet is the upper surface, and the present tablet is heated by the heater from the lower surface side.<br>
Examples of the pests to be controlled are various harmful arthropods (e.g. insects, acarina) and so on, especially flying insects.   They are. for example, Dipterean pests including Culexspp. such as Culexpipienspallens (common mosquito) and Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes spp. such as Aedes aegypti(yellow fever mosquito) and Aedes albopictus, Anopheles spp. such as Anopheles sinensis, Chironomidae (midges), Muscidae such as Musca domestica (housefly), Musca hervei and Fannia canicularis, Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, Drosophilidae (vinegar flies), Psychodidae (moth flies), Phoridae, Tabanidae (breeze flies), Simuliidae (black flies), Stomoxyidae (stable flies) and<br>

Q,28cm fibrous plate carrier of pulp and cotton linter.   The carrier was charged in a 3.8cmX2.5cm aluminum-laminated bag and the mouth of the bag was closed by heat-seal.   The clearance of the carrier and the aluminum-laminated bag was 2mm or less.   An aperture given in Figure 1 (a = 0.555cm, b = 1.3cm, c = 0.43cm, d= 0.7cm) on one surface of the aluminum-laminated bag was made to give the reference tablet 2 (total area of the upper surface of the reference tablet 2 : 9.5cm2, aperture ratio : 17.7%). Test Example 1<br>
Two glass tubes (height: 12cm, internal diameter: 4cm, both ends are covered with 16 mesh nylon bets) were prepared, containing 10 female adult common mosquitoes (Culex pipiens pallens).<br>
On the upper part of a test cylinder having a height oi 80cm and a diameter of 20cm, a metal pedestal having a width of 7.8cm for the above-mentioned glass tube was suspended toward the diameter direction, at the center part. This pedestal has symmetrically two pores having a diameter of 4cm which is the same as the internal diameter of the glass tube, at a position of 4 cm from the center of the cylinder, and the above-mentioned glass tube containing female adult common mosquitoes was placed on this pedestal, so as to give a condition under which a gas flow from the lower part of the test cylinder passes through in the glass tube. A transparent resin cylinder for observation having a diameter of 20cm and a height of 30cm was placed on the upper part of the test cylinder so that the outer diameters of them overlapped.<br>
On the other hand, the present tablet 1 was installed in an electric heater for controlling mosquitoes, and heated in advance outside of the test cylinder at about 170^0, and when the heating continued for 168 hours, this was moved to the bottom surface in the test cylinder, and heating by the above-mentioned electric heater for controlling mosquitoes was continued, the number of female adult common mosquitoes knocked down was counted at each elapsed time, and a time when 50% of female adult common mosquitoes supplied to the test were knocked down (KT50 value) was measured. This glass tube was removed, further, heating by the above-mentioned electric heater for controlling mosquitoes was continued. 288, 528, 673 and 819 hours after initiation of the first heating (when heating at about 170*0 outside of the above-mentioned test cylinder was initiated), the same test was conducted<br>
^3<br><br>
using new common mosquitoes.<br>
The common mosquitoes known down tests were conducted in the same manner as described above, after elapsed times shown in Tables 2 to 8, using the present tablets 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, reference tablets 1 and 2, and electric heater for controlling mosquitoes having heater temperatures shown in Tables 2 to 8.   The results are shown in Tables 1 to 8.<br><br><br><br>
As shown above, the present invention provides effective control for pest, especially flying insects such as mosquitoes, for a long time.<br>
