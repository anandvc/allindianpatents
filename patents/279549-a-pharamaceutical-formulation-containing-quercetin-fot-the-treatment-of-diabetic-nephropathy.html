				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating diabetic nephropathy.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention:<br>
Diabetic nephropathy is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus involving glomerular basement membrane thickening due to decrease in heparan sulphate and laminin and increase in type-IV collagen. Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by increased excretion of urine with micro and macromolecules (viz. proteins, glucose etc), as a result of glomerular basement membrane. During diabetic nephropathy, the functional unit of kidney, the nephrons are damaged leading to increased filtration rate.<br>
Diet plays a major role in the management of diabetes and its associated complications. In this aspect, role of many traditional practices involving medicinal plants are known to have preventive and therapeutic value in diabetes management. The bioactive principles of medicinal plants and foods of medicinal value are receiving much scientific attention in recent years. In this direction anti-oxidants are of considerable interest. Higher oxidative stress is one of the factors implicated in the development and progression of diabetic complications resulting in increased levels of free radicals or impaired anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. Epidemiological evidence has suggested that anti-oxidant rich dietary flavanoids have potential health beneficial effects.<br>
Quercetin is a well-documented bioflavonoid occurring in many foods and is known to be present in higher concentrations in onions, apples, broccoli, green tea and red wine. Hence, the polyphenolic compounds constitute an integral part of human diet though they are considered as non-nutrients. Many studies have focused towards the beneficial properties of quercetin, namely, anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic. However, the anti-diabetic property of querectin is yet not reported anywhere nor studied. A formulation involving quercetin could be expected to have a significant role in combating glomerular filtration rate and progression of diabetic nephropathy<br>
 <br>
Reference may be made to US patent US 6,291,533 (2001) wherein quercetin dihydrate was used as a supplement in the compositions for treating people with a specific blood type. Drawback of this composition is that it is designed for people with specific antigenic blood types and have not specified for diabetes and its associated problems.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 20030108624 (2003) wherein Gymnema sylvestre; Fenugreek seed and Ginkgo biloba are used for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and disorders including the complications of diabetes mellitus. Drawback of this is it fails to explain the specific role of quercetin in diabetic nephropathy.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 20020025347 (2002) wherein aqueous extract of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix herb is used for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria. Drawback of this invention is the composition of the herb and antioxidant activity in treatment of diabetic nephropathy is not clear.<br>
Reference may be made to the US patent 20020192314 (2002) wherein dietary supplements of grape skin and grape seed extract can inhibit platelet aggregation or LDL cholesterol oxidation in a mammal. Drawback of this invention is that it deals with variety of polyphenolic components in prevention of oxidation but it does not specify for diabetes and its complications in particular diabetic nephropathy.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 6572897 (2003) wherein formulation contains essential amounts of alpha lipoic acid, chromium, lutein, bioflavonoids(quercetin and rutin), mormordica charantia extract, corosolic acid, and gymnema sylvestre extract used for insulin sensitivity and blood sugar level maintenance for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. The drawback of this formulation is it does not explain the effect of this in diabetic nephropathy state and it is not a single component used for the treatment.<br>
 <br>
Reference may be made to the Japanese patent 2002080362 (2002) wherein gallic ester, galloyl tannin, quercetin, catechins and epicatechins are used in regulating PPAR-(Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor)-dependent gene transcription activity; an agent for obesity, diabetes, hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia and insulin resistance. Drawback of this invention is it does not explain the activity of diabetic nephropathy complications.<br>
Reference may be made to the patent WO0059522 (2000) wherein extracted products from Brickellia californica and its isolated flavonoids, including apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and dihydroxykaemferol results in lowering of blood sugar and are thereby used in the treatment of both insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes. The drawback of this is that it is an herbal extract and it does not explain the role of quercetin in diabetes or its complications.<br>
Reference may be made to the Japanese patent 3232851 (1991) wherein phenolic compounds extracted from various plants like tannic acid, pentagalloyl glucose, rutin, quercetin, epicatechin are used as therapeutic agent of various complications in diabetes mellitus such as cataract, retinopathy, kidney disease or nerve disturbance by inhibiting aldose reductase. The drawback of this invention is that it does not clearly explain the role of these compounds in glomerular filtration rate during diabetic nephropathy state.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 2004258674 (2004) wherein nutritional supplement of quercetin to treat hypertenstion, therby preventing cardiovascular disease is disclosed. The drawback of this treatment is that it does not explain anything about diabetes and its related complications.<br>

Example 1<br>
Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats weighing around 120 g using streptozotocin at 55 mg / kg body weight and the rats were fed with formulation comprising quercetin. After three days, diabetic status was assessed by measuring fasting blood glucose level in plasma and urine sugar levels. Fasting blood glucose level was measured in the plasma of the rats by glucose oxidase method. The reaction mixture containing plasma and reagent was incubated for 15 minutes and absorbance was measured at 505nm. Urine was collected under the layer of toluene for 24 hrs and urine sugar (reducing) levels were measured by Dinitrosalicylic acid method. The reaction mixture was kept in boiling water bath for 10 minutes and colour developed was measured at 540 nm.<br>
Formulation devoid of quercetin was not effective in controlling the increased levels of fasting blood glucose, urine volume (Tablel), urine sugar (Tablel) during diabetes. Formulation involving antioxidant - quercetin was effective in controlling these changes as evident in Table 1. These results clearly indicate that during diabetes, progression of diabetic nephropathy was considerably controlled with the formulation comprising quercetin (Tablel).<br>

Example 2<br>
Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats weighing around 110-120 g using streptozotocin at 55 mg/kg body weight and the rats were fed with formulation comprising of quercetin. After three days diabetic status was assessed by measuring fasting blood glucose level in plasma and urine sugar levels. Fasting blood glucose level was measured in the plasma of the rats by glucose oxidase method. The reaction mixture containing plasma and reagent was incubated for 15 minutes and absorbance was measured at 505nm. Urine was collected under the layer of toluene and urine sugar (reducing) levels, was measured by dinitrosalicylic acid. The reaction mixture was kept in boiling water bath for 10 minutes and colour developed was measured at 540 nm.<br>
Jrinary creatinine was estimated by alkaline picrate reagent methi<br>
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes and a<br>
measured at 520 nm. The plasma was deproteinised using tungstic<br>
creatinine estimation.<br>
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined at the end of the experiment by<br>
measuring urinary and plasma creatinine. The formula used was-<br>
Urinary creatinine (mg/dL) X urine volume (ml)<br>
 <br>
GFR =<br>
 <br>
—ml/min<br>
 <br>
Plasma creatinine (mg/dL) X 1440 (min)<br>
As evident from the results formulation devoid of quercetin deteriorated kidney filtration during diabetes. Formulation involving antioxidant - quercetin was effective in controlling the kidney filtration during diabetes. Results clearly indicate that during diabetes, progression of diabetic nephropathy was considerably controlled with the formulation comprising quercetin (Table2).<br>
