				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the manufacture of epichlorohydrin by the oxidation of allyl chloride. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of epichlorohydrin by the oxidation of allyl chloride using molecular oxygen as the oxidant and a solid organotransi-tion metal complex as a catalyst.<br>
Epichlorohydrin is a useful intermediate in the manufacture of a wide variety of products. The oxirane functionality in epichlorohydrin is highly reactive and may be ring opened with any number of nucleophilic reagents. For example, the epoxide ring may be hydrolysed to yield glycols or reactive monomers for the preparation of condensation polymers.<br>
Many different methods for the preparation of epichlorohydrin have been developed in the prior art. In current commercial practice epichlorohydrin is manufactured by the epoxidation of allyl chloride by calcium hypochlorite. One major drawback in such process is the necessity to dispose off large quantities of the low value byproduct, calcium chloride in an environmentally acceptable manner. Approximately one equivalent of calcium chloride coproduct is obtained for each equivalent of epichlorohydrin. Another method known in the prior art for the preparation of epichlorohydrin involves the use of certain titanium silicate compounds to catalyse allyl chloride oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. This method is described, for example in U.S.<br>
Patents 4, 824, 976 (Clerici et al) and 4, 833, 260 (Neri et al). Even though letter process does not generate environmentally harmful low value coproducts which have to be disposed off, it is economically less viable since it involves the use of the more expensive hydrogen peroxide as the source of oxygen and hence has not been adopted in common commercial practice.<br>
Development of a process which uses the less expensive molecular oxygen as the oxidant for oxidation of allyl chloride to epichlo-rohydrin, does not generate environmentally harmful effluents and preferably uses a solid catalyst for the oxidation reaction is desirable.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the manufacture of epichlorohydrin by the oxidation of allyl chloride using an oxygen - containing gas as the oxidant.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has now been found that allyl chloride may readily be oxidised with air selectively to epichlorohydrin in the presence of certain solid catalysts containing particular organotransition metal complexes. The use of these catalysts in the process of oxidation of allyl chloride results in several unexpected advantages. The catalyst remains in the solid state at the end of the oxidation reaction thereby facilitating the easy separation, recovery and recycle of the<br>
catalyst from the reaction products without having any adverse impact on the environment.<br>
The oxidation of compounds containing carbon-carbon double bonds with molecular oxygen is known in the prior art to yield the allylic oxidation products rather than the epoxide. Thus, the air oxidation of propylene yields mainly acrolein rather than the epoxide propylene oxide. Similarly, the air oxidation of styrene yields benzaldehyde rather than the epoxide styrene oxide (see E.R. Birnbaum et al Journal of Molecular Catalysis, A, 104 (1995) pp L119-L122).<br>
We have now made the unexpected discovery that when allyl chloride is reacted with molecular oxygen in the presence of certain solid catalysts containing an organotransition metal complex wherein some or all of the hydrogen atoms of the said organotransition metal complex have been substituted by one or more electron withdrawing groups, the epoxidation product epi-chlorohydrin rather than products arising from allylic oxidation is formed in a highly selective manner.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organotransition metal complex is a pthalocyanine.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the transition metal is selected from iron, cobalt, copper, chromium , manganese or mixtures thereof.<br>
Some  nonlimiting  examples   of   such  organo  transition  metal   complexes   used  as   catalysts   in  the  oxidation  of  allyl  chloride  to epichlorohydrin are iron halopthalocyanines,   copper,   halo pthalocyanines,   cobalt   halo  pthalocyanines,   chromium  halo  pthalocya-nines,   manganese  halo pthalocyanines,   iron  nitro pthalocyanines, copper   nitro   pthalocyanines,   chromium  nitro   pthalocyanines, cobalt   nitro   pthalocyanines,   manganese   nitro   pthalocyanines, manganese  cyano  pthalocyanines,   copper  cyano  pthalocyanines   and chromium cyano pthalocyanines.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention the electron withdrawing groups attached to the organotransition metal complex is selected from the halogens, fluorine, chlorine or bromine or the nitro or cyano groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxidation of allyl chloride by molecular oxygen is catalysed by the halogen, cyano or nitro pthalocyanines of the metals iron, cobalt, copper, chromium or manganese.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the source of molecular oxygen can be pure oxygen gas, air or a mixture of oxygen and an inert gas diluent like nitrogen.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the above mentioned oxidation reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of solvents. It may be an advantageous option to<br>
carry out  the  said oxidation reaction  in  the presence  of  a  suitable   solvent  which  would  maintain  the   oxidation  products   like epichlorohydrin  in the  dissolved  state  during  the  course  of  the reaction,   thereby  facilitating  the   separation  of   the   said   epichlorohydrin   from  the   solid  catalysts.      Suitable   solvents   for such  use   include   acetonitrile,   methanol,   water,   butanol   and cyclohexanol.     Examples  of such  solvents  which can be  used  in the process   of  the  present  invention  include  acetonitrile,   acetone, benzene  or  any  other  organic   solvent  which  is   inert  under  the oxidation reaction conditions.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the rates of the oxidation of allyl chloride to epichlorohydrin may be significantly enhanced by addition of very small catalytic quantities of a promoter. Examples of such promoters include alkyl hydroperoxide, dialkylperoxides and such compounds. Cyclo-hexyl hydroperoxide, cumyl peroxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide are some of the examples of such promoters which may be present in concentrations not exceeding 1% by weight of allyl chloride and more preferably 0.1% by weight of allyl chloride.<br>
In yet another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the organotransition metal complex may be encapsulated in a solid matrix. Due to the greater dispersion of the organotransition metal complex catalyst in solid matrices and the consequent enhanced stability of the structural integrity of the catalyst significant process advantages like greater activity, stability<br>
and easy recovery and recyclability of the catalyst are observed. Examples of such solid matrices include inorganic oxide like silica, alumina, molecular sieves, zeolites and the like as well as organic polymeric material.<br>
It is an advantageous feature of the process of the present invention that due to the high activity the catalysts used herein, the oxidation reaction can be carried out at temperatures much below those used in the prior art and preferably below 90°C, thereby leading to much lower yields of undesired side products.<br>
The details of the present invention is described in the examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
