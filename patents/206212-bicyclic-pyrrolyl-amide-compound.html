COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"BICYCLIC PYRROLYL AMIDE COMPOUND"<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,   a   Swedish   company,   of  S-151   85   Sodertalje, Sweden,<br><br><br><br><br>
The   following   specification  particularly  describes   the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a bcyclic pyprolyl amide compound.<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic amide derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof. These heterocyclic amides possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with increased glycogen phosphorylase activity and thus are potentially useful in methods for the treatment of a warm-blooded animal such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said heterocyclic amide derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of 10     medicaments to inhibit glycogen phosphorylase activity in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
The liver is the major organ regulating glycaemia in the post-absorptive state.<br>
Additionally, although having a smaller role in the contribution to post-prandial blood glucose<br>
levels, the response of the liver to exogenous sources of plasma glucose is key to an ability to<br>
15     maintain euglycaemia. An increased hepatic glucose output (HGO) is considered to play an<br>
important role in maintaining the elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels seen in type 2<br>
diabetics; particularly those with a FPG &gt;140mg/dl (7.8mM). (Weyer et al, (1999), J Clin<br>
Invest 104: 787-794; Clore &amp; Blackgard (1994), Diabetes 43: 256-262; De Fronzo, R. A., et<br>
al, (1992) Diabetes Care 15; 318 - 355; Reaven, G.M. (1995) Diabetologia 38; 3-13).<br>
20	Since current oral, anti-diabetic therapies fail to bring FPG levels to within the normal,<br>
non-diabetic range and since raised FPG (and glycHbAlc) levels are risk factors for both macro- (Charles,. M.A. et al (1996) Lancet.348,1657-1658; Coutinho, M. et al (1999) Diabetes Care 22; 233-240; Shaw, J.E. et al (2000) Diabetes Care 23, 34-39) and micro-vascular disease (DCCT Research Group (1993) New. Eng. J. Med. 329; 977-986); the reduction and normalisation of elevated FPG levels remains a treatment goal in type 2 diabetes.<br>
It has been estimated that, after an overnight fast, 74% of HGO is derived from ' glycogenosis with the remainder derived from gluconeogenic precursors (Hellerstein et al (1997) Am J Physiol, 272: E163). Glycogen phosphorylase is a key enzyme in the generation 30     by glycogenosis of glucose-1-phosphate, and hence glucose in liver and also in other tissues such as muscle and neuronal tissue.<br>
Liver glycogen phosphorylase activity is elevated in diabetic animal models including the db/db mouse and the fa/fa rat (Aiston S et al (2000). Diabetalogia 43, 589-597).<br><br><br>
Inhibition of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase with chloroindole inhibitors (CP91149 and CP320626) has been shown to reduce both glucagon stimulated glycogenosis and       glucose output in hepatocytes (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41, 2934-8; Martin et al<br>
(1998) PNAS 95, 1776-81, WO 96/39384 and WO 96/39385). Additionally, plasma glucose 5     concentration is reduced, in a dose related manner, in db/db and ob/ob mice following treatment with these compounds.<br>
Studies in conscious dogs with glucagon challenge in the absence and presence of another glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, Bay K 3401, also show the potential utility of such agents where there is elevated circulating levels of glucagon, as in both Type 1 and Type 2 l0     diabetes. In the presence of Bay R 3401, hepatic glucose output and arterial plasma glucose levels following a glucagon challenge were reduced significantly (Shiota et al, (1997), Am J Physiol, 273: E868).<br>

Scheme 1 Compounds of formula (Ila) and amines of formula (1TI) are commercially available or they are known compounds or they are prepared by processes known in the art.<br>
It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or ^-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali<br><br>
WOW/25530	PCTjiSEWW880<br>
metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a /-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or triffuoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylammopropylarnine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a /-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>

density due to inorganic phosphate formation was measured at 620nM in a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF by the general method of (Nordlie R.C and Arion WJ, Methods of Enzymology, 1966, 619-625). The reaction is in 50mM HEPES, 2.5mM MgCl2, 2.25mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-^tiaacetic acid, lOOmM KC1, 2mM D-(+)-glucose pH7.2, containing 0.5mM dithiothreitol, the assay buffer solution, with O.lmg type HI glycogen, 0.15ug glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa) from rabbit muscle and 0.5mM glucose-1-phosphate. GPfl is pre-incubated in the assay buffer solution with the type EI glycogen at 2.5 mg ml"1 for 30 minutes. 40ul of the enzyme solution is added to 25|il assay buffer solution and the reaction started with the addition of 25fil 2mM glucose-1-phosphate. Compounds to be tested are prepared in IOJUJ 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of 10pl 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 30uM CP320626 (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41, 2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95, 1776-81). The reaction is stopped after 30min with the addition of 50pl acidic ammonium molybdate solution, 12ug ml"1 in 3.48% H2SO4 with 1% sodium lauryl sulphate and lOug ml"1 ascorbic acid. After 30 minutes at room temperature the absorbency at 620nm is measured.<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOpM or 1OOPM. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an IC50, a 20     concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%. Activity is calculated as follows:-% inhibition = (1 - (compound OD620 - fully inhibited OD620)/ (non-inhibited rate OD620 -fully inhibited OD620)) * 100. OD620 = optical density at 620nM.<br>
Typical IC50 values for compounds of the invention when tested in the above assay are in the range lOOuM to InM.<br>
