				<td>Animal protein-free media for cultivation of cells FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The present invention relates to animal protein-free cell culture media comprising a polyamine and a plant- and/or yeast-derived hydrolysate. The invention also relates to animal protein-free culturing processes, wherein cells can be cultivated, propagated and passaged without adding supplementary animal proteins in the culture medium. These processes are useful in cultivating cells, such as recombinant cells or cells infected with a virus, and for producing biological products by cell culture processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] For cultivation of cells, particularly eukaryotic cells, and more specifically mammalian cells, there is a constant need to use special culture media that make available the growth nutrient substances that are required for efficient growth of the cells and for the production of the proteins or viruses that are d&amp;sired. For the efficient production of biological products, such as viruses or recombinant proteins, it is important that an optimal cell density is achieved as well as the protein expression itself is increased to obtain maximal product yield.<br>
[003] Cell culture media formulations have been supplemented with a range of additives, including undefined components like; fetal calf serum. (FCS), several animal derived proteins and/or protein hydrolysates of bovine origin.<br>
[004] In general, serum or serum-derived substances, such as albumin, transferrin or insulin, may contain unwanted agents that can contaminate trie cell cultures and the biological products obtained therefrom. Furthermore, human serum derived additives have to be tested for all known viruses, including hepatitis and HIV, that can be<br>
transmitted by serum. Moreover, bovine serum and products derived therefrom bear the risk of BSE contamination. In addition, all serum-derived products can be contaminated by unknown constituents. In the case of serum or protein additives that are derived from human or other animal sources in cell culture, there are numerous problems (e.g. the varying quality in composition of the different batches and the risk of contamination with mycoplasma, viruses or BSE), particularly if the cells are used for production of drugs or vaccines for human administration.<br>
[005] Therefore, many attempts have been made to provide efficient host systems and cultivation conditions, which do not require serum or other animal protein compounds. Simple serum free medium typically includes basal medium, vitamins, amino acids organic or inorganic salts, and optionally additional components to make the medium nutritionally complex.<br>
[006] Soy hydrolysates are known to be useful for fermentation processes and can enhance the growth of many fastidious organisms, yeasts and fungi. WO 96/26266 describes that papaic digests of soy meal are a source of carbohydrate and nitrogen and many of the components can be used in tissue culture. Franek et al. (Biotechnology Progress (2000) 16, 688 - 692) describe growth and productivity promoting effects of defined soy hydrolysate peptide fractions.<br>
[007] WO 96/15231 discloses serum-free medium composed of the synthetic minimal essential medium and yeast extract for propagation of vertebrate cells and virus production process. A medium formulation composed of a basal cell culture .medium comprising a rice peptide and an extract of yeast and enzymatic digest thereof, and/or a plant lipid for growth of animal cells is disclosed in WO 98/15614. A medium comprising purified soy hydrolysate for the cultivation of recombinant cells is disclosed in WO 01/23527. WO 00/03000 discloses a medium that comprises a soy hydrolysate and a yeast extract, but also requires the presence of recombinant forms of animal proteins, such as growth factors.<br>
[008] EP-A-0 481 791 describes a biochemically defined culture medium for culturing engineered CHO cells, which is free from protein, lipid and carbohydrate isolated from an animal source, further comprising a recombinant insulin or insulin analogue, 1 % to 0.025 % w/v papain digested soy peptone and putrescine. WO 98/08934 describes a serum-free eukaryotic cell culture comprising hydrolyzed soy peptides (1-1000 mg/L), 0.01 to 1 mg/L putrescine and a variety of animal-derived components, including albumin, fetuin, various hormones and other proteins. In this context, it should be also noted that putrescine is also known to be contained in standard media like DMEM/Ham's F12 in a concentration of 0.08 mg/L.<br>
[009] However, the media known in the state of art are often nutritionally insufficient and/or must be supplemented with animal-derived protein supplements or recombinant versions of proteins, such as insulin, insulin like growth factor or other growth factors.<br>
[010] Therefore, a current need exists to increase the yield of expressed recombinant protein or any other expression product, and specific growth rate of cells, and to provide an optimal cell culture medium completely free of animal proteins for production of biological products, such as those used as Pharmaceuticals or vaccines in humans.<br>
[011] On the basis of soy peptone extracts (also designated as "soy hydrolysates") media have been developed, which do not contain animal proteins. However, the quality of commercially available lots of soy hydrolysates varies extremely and as a result, there are large variations in the production of recombinant proteins or viral products (a Variation of up to a factor of 3) as a function of the lots of soy hydrolysates used ("lot-to-lot variation"). This draw back affects the proliferation of the cells as well as the protein expression of each cell.<br>
[012] Therefore, there is a need for an animal protein-free cell culture medium which is completely free of animal proteins and overcomes at least one of the above-mentioned problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[013] An object of the present invention is to provide an animal protein-free cell culture medium which does not contain any added supplementary proteins derived from an animal source and/or recombinant animal proteins, which allows efficient cell growth and in particular protein production in a continuous quality with respect to the amount of expression per cell. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for cultivating cells and a method for efficient expression of recombinant proteins which are free of animal proteins.<br>
[0*14] Another object of the present invention is to reduce plant and/or yeast derived hydrolysate in order to overcome inhibitory effects which would negatively impact the production yield of a desired recombinant or viral product Hydrolysates were surprisingly found to be the cause of the lot-to-lot variations in production.<br>
[015] The animal protein-free cell culture medium according to the invention comprises at least one polyamine and a plant- and/or yeast-derived hydrolysate, wherein the polyamine preferably originates from a source other than the protein hydrolysate.<br>
[016] Surprisingly, the addition of at least one polyamine, in particular the addition of putrescine, to the animal protein-free cell culture medium provides the advantageous effect not only to promote the cell growth but in particular to increase the protein expression per cell and, in particular, recombinant protein expression per cell. .<br>
[017] Further, the animal protein-free medium according to the present invention allows consistent cell growth and increased yield of desired products, particularly of target proteins such as recombinant proteins, independent of the quality or lot variations of the protein hydrolysate, in particular of the vegetable hydrolysates, in the animal protein-free cell culture medium. The specific supplementation of cell culture media with polyamines<br>
and a plant- and/or yeast-derived hydrolysate acts synergistically to increase cell growth, cell specific productivity and final cell density.<br>
[018] Therefore, the animal protein free medium according to the present invention is more favorable for recombinant protein expression and cell growth rate compared to the media known in the art. Furthermore, the animal protein-free medium according to the present invention allows the reduction of the amount of protein hydrolysate to be added to a given volume of the cell culture medium.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[028] One aspect of the invention relates to an anim al protein-free cell culture medium comprising at least one polyamine and a plant- and/or yeast-derived hydrolysate, in a concentration sufficiently reduced in order to avoid potential inhibitory effects of the hydrolysate.<br>
[029] The term "polyamine" refers to any of a group of organic compounds composed of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen, and containing two or more amino groups. For example, the term encompasses molecules selected from the group consisting of cadaverine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, agmatine, and ornithine.<br>

[033] The term "animal protein free cell culture medium" according to the invention refers to a medium that does not contain proteins and/or protein components from higher multicellular non-plant eukaryotes. Typical proteins that are avoided are those found in serum and serum-derived substances, such as albumin, transferrin, insulin and other growth factors. The animal protein free cell culture medium is also free of any purified animal derived products and recombinant animal derived products as well as protein digests and extracts thereof or lipid extracts or purified components thereof. Animal proteins and protein components are to be distinguished from non-animal proteins, small peptides and oligopeptides obtainable from plants (usually 10 - 30 amino acids in length), such as soy bean, and lower eukaryotes, such as yeast whi ch may be included into the animal protein free cell culture medium according to the invention.<br>
[034] The animal protein free culture medium according to the invention may be based on any basal medium such as DMEM, Ham's F12, Medium 199, McCoy or RPMI generally known to the skilled worker. The basal medium may comprise a number of ingredients, including amino acids, vitamins, organic and inorganic salts, and sources of carbohydrate, each ingredient being present in an amount which supports the* cultivation of a cell which is generally known to the person skilled in the art. The medium may contain auxiliary substances, such as buffer substances like sodium bicarbonate, antioxydants, stabilisers to counteract mechanical stress, or protease inhibitors. If required, a non-ionic surfactant such as mixtures of polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols (e.g. Pluronic F68 ®, SERVA) can be added as a defoaming agent.<br>

[059] The present invention further relates to a method of using the animal protein-free cell culture medium according to the invention for culturing cells expressing a target protein.<br>
[060] The present invention will now be further illustrated in the following examples, without being limited thereto.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1 (BAV-medium)<br>
[061J Animal protein free medium was prepared with basal DMEM/HAM's F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with inorganic salts, amino acids, vitamins and other components (Life technologies, 32500 Powder). Also added were L-glutamine ( 600 mg/L), ascorbic acid (20pM), ethanol amine (25 uM), Synperonic ® (SERVA) (0.25 g/L), sodium selenite (50 nM). Additionally, essential amino acids were supplemented to the cell culture medium. Further, varying concentrations of soy hydrolysate (Quest Technologies, NY or DMV Intl., NY ) in the range of 0,0-1,0% and varying concentrations of polyamines (0-10 mg/L) were added (Figure 1-9)<br>
Example 2<br>
[062] Cell cultures of recombinant mammalian cells (e.g. CHO-cells stably expressing Factor VIII = GD8/6-cells) were grown in suspension in a chemostat culture in 10 I bioreactors. The culture conditions of 37 °C, oxygen saturation 20% and prt 7.0 to 7.1 were kept constant. The cultures were supplied with a constant feed of BAV-medium as defined in Example 1 additionally supplemented with soy hydrolysates in the range of 0,1-1,0% and/or addition of putrescine.2HCI in the range of 0-1 mg/L (cf. Figure 1-5).<br>
[063] Small scale, experiments with GD8/6 cells in suspension culture were carried in Techne spinner flasks at 200 ml working volume in batch refeed mode at 37 °G, without pH and pO2 control. The cultures were supplied with BAV-medium as defined in Example 1 without supplementation of soy hydrolysate and polyamines, or supplemented with soy hydrolysate in the range of 0.1-0,4% and/or putrescine.2HCI, ornithine.HCI, spermine.4HCI in the range of 0-18 mg/L (equivalent to 0-10 rng/L of the polyamine without .HCI (cf. Figure 9).<br><br>
Example 3 fcf. Figure 1 to 5 7. and 9)<br>
[064] Cell counts from suspension cells or immobilized cells were determined either by counting with a CASY® cell counter as described by Scharfe et al., (Biotechnologie in LaborPraxis 10:1096 -1103 (1988)) or by citric acid extraction and flourescent staining of the nuclei followed by counting with a N ucleoCounter ® (Chemometec, DK). The specific growth rate (u) is calculated from the increase of the cell densities (Xt) and/or the dilution rate (D) of the steady state of chemostat cultures of suspensions cells over a certain time interval (t):<br>
u = D-Hn(Xt/XO)/t Example4<br>
[065] The activity of Factor VIII (FVIH) (cf. Figures 1 to 5 and 9) was measured by a chromogenic assay (Chromogenic, Sweden). The activity of erythropoeitin (cf. Figures) and the monoclonal antibody titer (cf. Figure 7) were measured by ELISA test systems.<br>
[066] The volumetric productivity is calculated from the amount of activity units or antigen titers yielded per liter reactor volume per day (U/L/d or mg/L/d) in the respective production systems.<br>
[067] The cell specific productivity is defined as the specific amount of produced protein (U or ug) per number of cells per day (cf. Figures 7 and 9) or as the specific amount of produced protein (U) produced per amount of D-glucose consumed by the cells (cf. Figure 8).<br><br>
Example 5<br>
[068] GD8/6 cells were supplied with BAV-medium containing 0.4% (w/v) of different soy hydrolysate lots. The volumetric FVII (-productivity varied from about 600 to 1800 U/L/d and the specific growth rates varied of from 0.35 to 0.52 u[d-1] between the different lots (cf. Figure 1). This indicates that the soy hydrolysate lots at the 0,4% concentration does not allow consistent growth of the GD8/6 cells, possibly due to inhibitory substances affecting the specific growth rate (u) which are contained in the soy hydrolysates.<br>
Example 6<br>
[069] GD8/6 cells were supplied with BAV-medium containing different concentrations of soy hydrolysate lot M022257 (in the range of 0.15 - 1,0% w/v). The volumetric FVI1I-productivity varied of from 500 to 1.100 U/L/d and reached an optimum productivity of 1.100 U/L/d at a soy hydrolysate concentration of 0.4% (w/v) (cf. Figure 2).<br>
Example 7<br>
[070] GD8/6 cells were supplied with BAV-medium containing 0.25 % (w/v) of the same 5 different soy hydrolysate lots as described in Example 5 (Figures 3A and 4A) and 0.25 % (w/v) soy hydrolysate of the same soy hydrolysate lots additionally supplemented with 1 mg/L putrescine.2 HCI (Figures 3B and 4B), respectively. The volumetric FVIII-productivity varied of from 1700 U/L/d to 500 U/L/d in the cells grown BAV-SP medium containing 0.25 % (w/v) soy hydrolysate of different soy hydrolysate lots- (Figure 3A). The specific growth rate varied of from 0.58 to 0.24 u[d-1], indicating that the reduction of the soy hydrolysate concentration does not lead to an improved or more consistent growth rate of the cells (Figure 4A).<br>
[071] In contrast, only minor variations of the volumetric FVIIl-productivity (Figure 3-B) and specific growth rates (Figure 4B) between the same soy hydrolysate lots are<br><br>
observed in the cells grown BAV-medium containing 0.25 % (w/v) soy hydrolysate when supplemented with 1 mg/L putrescine.2HCI. The addition of 1 mg/L putrescine.2HCI approximately compensates the reduction of this polyamine by the reduction of soy hydrolysate concentration from 0.4% (w/v) to O.25% (w/v). From this it can be concluded that not the concentration of the polyamine itseif, but the addition of the polyamine in combination with the reduction of the soy hydrolysate concentrations leads to a reduction of inhibitory substances which reduce growth and productivity (see Example 5). Furthermore, the addition of putrescine also leads to an over proportional increased volumetric productivity of FVIII due to an increase of the cell specific FVIII productivity (Figure 5).<br>
[072] Thus addition of putrescine to animal protein-free cell culture media not only promotes protein expression rate of cultured cells but it also reduces the amount of plant hydrolysate to be included into the culture media in order to obtain the same cell growth. As a result, culture media become less affected by the lot-by-lot variation of quality of plant hydrolysate and thus an overall improvement of the cell culture conditions is achieved.<br>
Example 8<br>
[073] Figure 5 comprises the statistical analysis of the Examples shown in Figure 1, 2 and 4: GD8/6 cells were supplied with BAV-medium containing 0.4% (w/v) of soy hydrolysate or 0.25% (w/v) soy hydrolysate or 0.25 % (w/v) soy hydrolysate and 1mg/L putrestine.2HCI. Standard deviations are calculated based on five selected lots of soy hydrolysates (K119-1, K138-1, M022963, MO24423, M022453). The volumetric and cell specific FVIII-productMty and the specific growth rate with 0.25% (w/v) soy hydrolysate was lower than with 0.4 % (w/v) soy hydrolysate, which confirms the optimum depicted in Figure 2. However, the volumetric and cell specific FVIII-productivity and the specific growth rate increases in cell culture medium containing 0.25% (w/v) soy hydrolysate + 1 mg/L putrescine.2HCI. Further, the standard deviation calculated from five different lots<br>
of soy hydrolysates is significantly reduced (cf. Figure 5 [QP [U/L/D] = volumetric productivity; qp [mil/106 cells / day] = cell specific productivity).<br>
Example 9<br>
[074] Examples 7 and 8 show that putrescine is an active compound supporting cell growth and, more specifically protein expression. Therefore, the concentration of putrescine from different soy hydrolysate lots from 2 different suppliers (Quest and DMV) were quantitatively analysed by a HPLC method and evaluated statistically. The concentration in the cell culture media prepared with soy hydrolysate from both suppliers was approximately 2.3 mg/L putrescine, when soy hydrolysate was added to the medium in a concentration of 0.4% (w/v) (cf. Figure 6).<br>
Example 10<br>
[075] ARH77 cells (human fymphoblastoid cell line stably expressing hlgG) were grown in a perfusion culture after immobilization on macroporous microcarriers in a 80 L stirred tank bioreactor at 37°C, pH 7,0-7,2 and p02 20-80% air saturation, supplied with BAV medium containing 0.4% (w/v) of soy hydrolysate or 0.25 % (w/v) soy hydrolysate + 1,8mg/L putrescine.2HCI. Arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated from data points representing the steady states for the respective medium formulations. The volumetric hlgG-volumetric productivity/cell specific productivity in BAV-medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) soy hydrolysate was lower than in BAV-medium supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) soy hydrolysate + 1,8mg/L putrescine.2HCI. This experiment indicates that the medium composition according to the present invention is capable to promote also the expression of monoclonal antibodies from a transformed cell line. Further, the specific medium composition can also be used in perfusion cultures (cf. Figure 7).<br>
Example 11<br>
[076] Recombinant BHK cells were grown to confluence in 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum containing medium. The cells were washed with protein-free medium and incubated for 3 days in BAV medium supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) soy hydrolysate or 0.25% (w/v) soy hydrolysate + 1,8mg/L putrescine.2HCI (Figure 8). Since no cell counting in this experiment was performed, the glucose consumption rate (g/L) was measured over three days to prove equivalent biomass in the culture system. The EPO-activity (mil/ml) was correlated with the glucose consumption rate (g/L) over three days. The addition of putrescine gives a 16% increase in EPO productivity compared to BAV-medium merely supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) soy peptone. This experiment also indicates that the medium composition according to the present invention is capable to promote the expression of different recombinant proteins.<br>
Example 12<br>
[077] To prove the specific effect of putrescine, omithine and spermine over a wider concentration range (0-18 mg/L equivalent to 0-10 mg/L of the polyamine without -.HCI) an experiment was carried where the GD8/6 cells were incubated in Techne spinner flasks at 1-1,5 E06 cells/ml in BAV-medium containing 0,25% and 0,4% soy hydrolysate without polyamines, and BAV-medium containing the reduced soy hydrolysate concentration of 0,25% with the polyamines in the above mentioned concentration range. All three polyamines in the investigated concentration range resulted in a significant increase of cell specific productivity (expressed in mU/106 cells/day) compared to the unsupplemente:d medium formulation with 0,25% soy hydroiysate, or the increased concentration of 0,4%. The increase of the cell specific productivity is clearly not correlating with an increased specific growth rate, which confirms the specific effect on the expression rate of recombinant FVIII of the GD8/6 cells (Figure 9).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
