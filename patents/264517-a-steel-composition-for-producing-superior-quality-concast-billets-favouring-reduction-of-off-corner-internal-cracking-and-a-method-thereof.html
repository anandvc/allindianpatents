				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is directed to a process of faster production of CONCAST billets to<br>
meet the quality and quantity requirements of the end users. More particularly, the<br>
invention is directed to superior quality billets for purposes like forging, spring making and<br>
wire rods at higher casting speeds and improved productivity, eliminating detrimental<br>
strand breakout events in continuous casting and the causes responsible for such<br>
phenomenon, leading to production loss, machine damage and serious safety hazards to<br>
operating personnel. The invention is also directed to a method and operational practices to<br>
restrict strand rupture/breakout occurrences in continuous casting eliminating the factors<br>
responsible for such event such as shell sticking, slag/scum entrapment, off-corner shell<br>
thinning and formation of severe longitudinal off-corner cracks and the like. The method of<br>
arresting the strand breakout of billets produced at faster casting speed involving operating<br>
parameters like-increased water velocity in mould to reduce mould distortion at higher<br>
speed, increased upper mould taper to avoid off-corner crack formation, providing below<br>
mould foot roll for extra support, improved below mould spray jacket, modified cooling<br>
water distribution and extension of secondary cooling zone length to eliminate<br>
halfway/midway/reheating cracks, modified oscillation stroke, developing nomogram for<br>
optimization of steel chemistry, such that the acceptance level of special quality steel billets<br>
has gone up from existing 50% to nearly 100% and the strand breakout frequency is<br>
reduced substantially from 1.8% per strand to less than 1.0 % per strand, improving<br>
productivity in CONCAST plant.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
It is well known in the art of steel products produced in steel plants, there is a growing<br>
demand of CONCAST billets. The quality of such products shall also meet stringent internal<br>
quality requirements for processing of steels of special applications at the consumers end<br>
such as forging, spring manufacturing, wire rods of varied sections. To meet the growing<br>
demand for good quality steel, higher casting speeds are required on one hand to achieve<br>
higher productivity and to identify and eliminate the casting defects on the other hand, is<br>
also extremely important for maintaining the quality/acceptance standard of cast billets<br>
produced at faster speed. The major defects occurring during casting of billets are<br>
longitudinal off-corner cracks, midway or reheating cracks, centerline cracks, pinholes and<br>
2<br><br>
blow holes etc. Longitudinal off-corner cracks are the defects usually occurring at or near<br>
the corner of the billets and initiate in or just below the mould. Local thinning of the solid<br>
shell near the corner region, higher corner temperature, in-mould bulging or mould<br>
distortion and steel composition are the main reasons responsible for the formation of<br>
longitudinal off-corner cracks. The halfway or the midway cracks are formed primarily<br>
between growing columnar dendrites and are aligned perpendicular to strand surface. Such<br>
cracks are formed during solidification of molten metal and are usually filled in by the<br>
residual elements like Sulphur and Phosphorus having lower solidification temperature,<br>
which reduces intrinsic toughness properties.<br>
Low alloy steel grades such as the forging quality and high carbon chrome bearing steel for<br>
automobile application and high carbon steel for agricultural appliances, when produced as<br>
billets in continuous casting plant, frequently suffer from strand breakouts which is as high<br>
as 1.6 to 1.8 % even at low and moderate casting speeds in the range of 2.0-2.2m/min, for<br>
reasons like severe longitudinal off-corner cracks and occurrence of slag breakouts caused<br>
due to unfavorable Mn/Si ratio in steel.<br>
The flow velocity of cooling water through the mould wall play an important role in mould<br>
heat extraction and thereby controlling the hot as well as cold face temperature of operating<br>
mould tube which in turn influence the rate of cooling and solidification of the cast billets.<br>
Water flow velocity in mould water channel for casting of 125mm square billets at the<br>
existing value of 
Electromagnetic stirring (EMS), leading to defects like the mould distortion due to high hot<br>
face temperature, and nucleation boiling of water in the mould water channel leading to<br>
poor heat transfer inducing formation of crack due to higher strand temperature.<br>
Further, the existing secondary zone comprising MS zone-0.3 m long with cooling water<br>
distribution rate of 165 Ipm, zone -I -1.5m long having water distribution of 180 Ipm and<br>
the zone-IIA -1.9m long having the water distribution of 80 Ipm; thus the total length of<br>
secondary cooling spreading over 3.7 m, was found to be insufficient as compared to the<br>
computed Crater length of 8-9m, up to end of solidification, while casting was carried out at<br>
a speed of 2.2-2.6m/min; further the secondary cooling water distribution/flow rate was<br>
independent of casting speed resulting in strand reheating to an extent of 120°C and leading<br>
to formation of halfway and centerline cracks. This arrangement needed a relook at<br>
determining the proper zone length and distribution of cooling water to avoid the defects as<br>
3<br><br>
mentioned. In addition to these factors, surface reheating due to improper secondary<br>
cooling tends to increase in tensile stresses at solid/liquid interfaces, giving rise to crack<br>
formation tendency. The centerline cracks on the other hand, originate during end of<br>
solidification due to uncontrolled excess of shrinkage of bulk casting body. Other defects<br>
such as the pinholes and blow holes occur due to mainly improper chemistry, impurities and<br>
excessive use of lubricating oil in mould.<br>
It is also a common experience in continuous casting of billets, the occurrences of breakout<br>
of CONCAST billets as a deleterious event. Breakout results in loss of production, yield loss,<br>
machine damage and in addition serious safety hazards to the operating personnel. Thus to<br>
identify and rectify/improve operational practices responsible for occurrence of breakout is<br>
of extreme importance in deciding indices for setting criteria in continuous casting. Reasons<br>
like the shell sticking, slag/scum entrapment, off-corner shell thinning and formation of<br>
longitudinal off-corner cracks and the like, are attributable to the event of breakout in<br>
continuous casting. Loss of steel contact with the mould wall either in the of-corner region<br>
or along the narrow face results in localized shell thinning which contributes to the<br>
formation of off-corner cracks and in extreme situation causes shell rupturing and breakout.<br>
In most of the integrated steel plants, the billets of section such as 125 mm sq., is produced<br>
for conversion to forging quality and spring steel products, through BOF-LTS/LF-CC route.<br>
The stringent quality requirements for these product grades lead to lower macro<br>
acceptability and consequently, higher rate of diversion to lower grades. A typical macro<br>
structure of billet samples of 125mm sq. section shows presence of defects like off-corner,<br>
midway/reheating and centerline cracks and also longitudinal off-corner related breakout is<br>
common during continuous casting of such billets.<br>
There has been therefore, a continuous need for developing an improved method for<br>
production of CONCAST billets at higher speed with necessary technical measures including<br>
modification/incorporation of process steps/parameters directed to identify the reasons and<br>
eliminate/reduce the occurrences of various types of cracks as observed in casting of billets<br>
and also to avoid breakout due to reasons like the shell sticking, slag/scum entrapment, off-<br>
corner shell thinning and formation of longitudinal off-corner cracks causing shell rupturing<br>
and breakout in extreme situation, and thereby avoid stopping production and improve<br>
productivity and yield, with increased acceptability of product quality.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE<br>
ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
The present invention relates to a method of casting superior quality concast billets at high<br>
casting speed, avoiding the occurrence of the event of shell rupturing and strand breakouts<br>
for the continuous cast billets, caused due to a number of reasons comprising shell sticking,<br>
slag/scum entrapment, off-corner shell thinning and formation of longitudinal off-corner<br>
cracks. Such events of rupture and breakout of billets are highly detrimental, expensive and<br>
leading to frequent interruption of production, resulting in poor productivity and yield.<br>
Conventionally, the forging and spring steel quality billets are produced in 125mm sq.<br>
section following the BOF-LTS/LF-CC route. The stringent quality requirements for these<br>
9<br><br>
grades tend to lower macro acceptability and consequently, higher rate of diversion to lower<br>
grades. Typical macro-structure of billet samples of 125mm square section shows<br>
occurrences of various cracks such as off-corner, mid-way/reheating and centerline cracks.<br>
In order to eliminate occurrences of these cracks in continuous casting of superior quality<br>
billets at high speed and improve the percent acceptance level of CC billets, the improved<br>
method of the present invention has been developed, reducing/avoiding the strand breakout<br>
phenomenon and the resultant loss of production and yield. The present invention is<br>
directed to a method of continuous casting of superior quality concast billets at fast speed<br>
avoiding rupture and strand breakouts comprising the following technical measures:<br>
a.	Increasing water velocity in mould to reduce mould distortion at higher speed;<br>
b.	Increase of upper mould taper to reduce strand breakout and off-corner crack<br>
formation;<br>
c.	Provisioning of below mould foot rool assembly for extra support;<br>
d.	Provisioning of modified below mould spray jacket for efficient cooling of the strand<br>
controlling cooling rate to avoid cracks;<br>
e.	Modifying secondary cooling water distribution and extension of secondary cooling<br>
zone length to reduce halfway/midway/reheating cracks.<br>
f.	Modification of mould oscillation stroke to accommodate suitable speed range and to<br>
improve surface quality.<br>
g.	Developing nomogram for optimization of steel chemistry.<br>
The method of the present invention ascertains the range of process parameters and related<br>
hardware means for implementation of the above said improvements in technological steps<br>
and procedure such that the cast billets quality acceptance goes up to nearly 100% from<br>
the existing 50% and the rate of occurrences of shell rupture or strand breakouts reduced<br>
from existing 1.8% to less than 1.0%.<br>
Reference is first invited to the accompanying Figure 1 that illustrates the occurrences of<br>
the various types of cracks in a typical macrosection of 125mm sq. standard billet produced<br>
by following conventional route of CONCAST billets wherein the off-corner cracks, centerline<br>
cracks and midway/reheating cracks have been shown. The accompanying Figure 2<br>
illustrates the phenomenon of longitudinal off-corner cracks propagated to develop strand<br>
breakout for a continuous cast 125mm sq. billet. The method of the present invention is<br>
directed to eliminating the event of crack occurrences and the consequent shell rupture and<br>
breakouts by adopting the measures details of which are as follows:<br>
10<br><br>
Nomogram for achieving desired steel composition:<br>
The present invention is directed to developing Nomogram between Manganese(Mn),<br>
Silicon(Si), Sulphur(S) and Carbon(C) in steel composition, among the commercially<br>
available steel grades produced by the steel industries comprising superior quality forging<br>
and spring steel grades which are subjected to frequent breakouts in continuous casting<br>
strands. Low alloy steel grades such as the forging quality and high carbon chrome bearing<br>
steel for automobile application and high carbon steel for agricultural appliances, when<br>
produced as billets in continuous casting plant, frequently suffer from strand breakouts<br>
which is as high as 1.6 to 1.8 % even at low and moderate casting speeds in the range of<br>
2.0-2.2m/min, for reasons like severe longitudinal off-corner cracks and occurrence of slag<br>
breakouts caused due to unfavorable Mn/Si ratio in steel.<br>
To avoid midway/reheat cracks, blow holes/pin holes and severe off corner cracks leading to<br>
strand breakouts at high speed casting of billets, a nomogram for adjustment of steel<br>
composition was prepared according to the present invention, based on the thermodynamic<br>
calculations.<br>
Mn-Si deoxidation practices are followed for reducing billets usually through open pour<br>
casting by metering nozzles in billet casters. To maintain desired flowability of liquid metal<br>
in mould, Mn/Si ratio is generally maintained at least 3.0. A low ratio of 
solid inclusions rich in silica are formed which in turn leads to formation of high melting<br>
point scum, tending to get entrapped between the mould walls and the solidifying shell of<br>
the steel. This viscous slag penetrates the mould-strand gap leading to poor lubrication and<br>
low mould heat transfers just beneath the mould meniscus. This leads to lowering of shell<br>
thickness along the regions where mould scum is entrapped. Due to such localized thinning<br>
of shells at the exit of mould fail to sustain ferrostatic pressure and thereby causing shell<br>
rupture and breakouts. Although the higher Mn/Si ratio(&gt;3.0) is maintained, as a thumb<br>
rule approach to deal with the problem and do not provide a comprehensive guide line for<br>
maintaining a chemistry in terms of C, Mn, Si in steel to form liquid inclusions. Thus for<br>
formation of liquid Mn-Si oxide inclusions, it is required to have different Mn/Si ratios<br>
compatible with carbon content in steel.<br>
As already discussed, the presence of off-corner cracks of varied intensity leads to internal<br>
quality problems causing higher rejection of the superior quality billets such as the forging<br>
11<br><br>
quality and spring steel quality billets and the associated costs incurred. Presence of one or<br>
more severe longitudinal off-corner cracks causes shell puncturing/rupturing or breakout at<br>
mould exit. Solidification of the cast billets free of any entrapment or inclusions or blow<br>
holes/pin holes and cracks provide desired shell rigidity and strength, avoiding frequent<br>
occurrences of breakouts. Increasing the Mn/S ratio is observed to have an important role<br>
for increasing shell strength and thereby reduces susceptibility to crack formation and<br>
propagation, responsible for strand rupture/breakouts.<br>
A nomogram among Silicon, manganese and Sulphur for different range of Carbon content<br>
in special grade steels, is prepared based on thermodynamic calculations, to ensure a<br>
chemistry providing desired Mn/Si corresponding to the chemistry such as to restrict<br>
occurrences of breakouts in continuous casting of billets at high speed. The nomogram is<br>
presented in following Table 1 And Table 2.<br>

The method of the present invention is thus directed to maintain steel chemistry of liquid<br>
steel for continuous casting of billets at high speed, by selectively maintaining Mn/Si &gt;3.0<br>
and Mn/S ranging 25 to 32 depending on carbon content of low alloy and special alloy steel<br>
for forging or spring steel applications, following the above nomogram developed in order to<br>
obtain rigidity and strength of appropriate order for desired control/stop occurrences of off-<br>
corner cracks in cast billets leading to strand rupture/breakout.<br>
Mould water flow velocity:<br>
The flow velocity of cooling water through the mould wall play an important role in mould<br>
heat extraction and thereby controlling the hot as well as cold face temperature of operating<br>
mould tube which in turn influence the rate of cooling and solidification of the cast billets. It<br>
has been observed that a high hot face temperature causes mould distortion near meniscus<br>
region whereas the high cold face temperature results in nucleation boiling of mould cooling<br>
water. The nucleation boiling of cooling water is a phenomenon leading to poor and non-<br>
uniform heat transfer causing non-uniform shell thickness and higher strand temperature<br>
inside mould. The situation gets further aggravated at high casting speeds and due to use of<br>
mould electromagnetic stirring (EMS). Water flow velocity in mould water channel for<br>
casting of 125mm square billets has been increased from existing value of 
13<br><br>
to be inadequate for high speed casting using EMS, to a velocity of &gt;11.5 m/sec, based on<br>
heat transfer calculations.<br>
Provisioning of mould Foot rolls and modified below-mould Spray jacket:<br>
While casting billets of superior quality at high speed in continuous caster moulds, there is a<br>
general tendency for the billets cast at high speeds subjected to lower shell thickness and<br>
high shell temperature of the solidifying strand. This in turn, results in lower shell strength.<br>
Moreover the shell thickness is found to be lowest at off-corner location due to in mould<br>
bulging. These are the reasons for which off-corner cracking occur in high-speed continuous<br>
casting of billets. The present invention is directed to arrest occurring of such longitudinal<br>
off-corner cracks leading to strand breakouts, by providing extra support to the thin and hot<br>
shell just below the mould, in the form of foot rolls for casting of 125mm sq. billets.<br>
Reference is now invited to the accompanying Figure 3, wherein the position and mounting<br>
arrangement of the Foot rolls for supporting the solidified strand is illustrated, that shows<br>
that roll support is provided from all four sides of the cast and solidified billet strand just<br>
below the mould and thus preventing in mould bulging and off-corner longitudinal cracking<br>
to avoid strand breakouts. The accompanying Figure 4, illustrates the modification effected<br>
in the below mould spray jacket to accommodate the Foot roll assemblies.<br>
Modification of Mould oscillation parameter:<br>
The method of casting superior quality concast billets at high speed according to the present<br>
invention, further takes into account the impact of mould oscillation parameter on the caster<br>
performance and product quality. It has been observed in the art of continuous casting, that<br>
the oscillation parameters have significant influence on caster performance and also on<br>
surface quality of solidifying strand in terms of laps/bleeds, when cast at high speed. Hot<br>
face temperature of mould tube depends on oscillation parameters. High mould oscillation<br>
stroke length increases shell deformation below the meniscus leading to sticker formation<br>
due to increased mould strand interaction. Moreover, high stroke length increases negative<br>
strip time causing deterioration of surface quality. Optimum oscillation parameters for billet<br>
caster for superior castings at high speed are experimentally standardized as follows:<br>
14<br><br>
Negative strip time	:0.12-0.15 sec<br>
Negative strip ratio	:60-70%<br>
Mould lead	:3-5 mm<br>
In the conventional caster operation, a mould oscillation parameter value having stroke<br>
12mm at a frequency of 150 cycles per minute, found to be not suitable for the speed range<br>
of 2.3-2.8 m/min. On contrary, the oscillation stroke of 12mm is suitable for a very high<br>
casting speed of &gt;2.5 m/min as per the conventional practice, the corresponding figures<br>
shown in bold figures in the following Table 3. However, the improvement in terms of<br>
superior billet quality and low breakout occurrences is achieved by adjusting/modifying the<br>
mould oscillation stroke to 11 mm. The modified oscillation parameters with modified<br>
stroke are given in the following Table 4. It is apparent from the Table 4, that the<br>
oscillation parameters are within the desired acceptable range of values in the casting speed<br>
range of 2.3-2.8m/min.<br>

Provisioning of higher upper taper in multi tapered mould:<br>
Conventionally, mould taper is provided to compensate the shrinkage of the solidifying<br>
strand in the mould. In addition, taper also compensates the mould distortion that takes<br>
place in the upper region of the mould due to high mould hot face temperature. The high<br>
hot face temperature is mainly due to high heat extraction in the upper part of the mould<br>
leading to the formation of the negative taper. The problem gets further complex at higher<br>
casting speeds. The provision of negative taper in the upper portion of the mould causes in<br>
mould bulging and excessive gap formation resulting in poor strand-mould interaction. This<br>
phenomenon has an adverse effect leading to the formation of deeper oscillation marks on<br>
the strand surface, off-squareness of billet and formation of off-corner cracks. As an viable<br>
better alternative, Triple tapered mould is used in existing method for casting of 125mm sq.<br>
section billet having the configuration as follows:<br>
Upper Taper: 2.1%; Middle Taper :0.9%; Lower taper :0.5%;<br>
Taper configuration was modified to increase upper taper for compensating the high mould<br>
distortion at selective high casting speed exceeding 2.5m/min. Thus the present invention is<br>
directed to apply triple tapered mould with preferred higher upper taper of 2.4% as<br>
compared to existing 2.1% in the mould, to overcome the problems of crack or poor surface<br>
of strand, while middle and lower taper are maintained at the conventional values.<br>
16<br><br>
Extension and modification of secondary cooling zone length:<br>
The length of secondary cooling zones and the water spray/distribution pattern has the<br>
importance in respect of formation of halfway/midway or reheating cracks, the nature,<br>
origin and location of such cracks tend to use these names synonymously, and also the<br>
centerline cracks in continuous casting of superior quality billets. Improper secondary zone<br>
length selection and inadequate cooling water distribution therein, tends to strand reheating<br>
resulting in the high thermal stresses and strains at the solidifying front. When the thermal<br>
strains developed due to reheating exceeds a critical value, cracks may initiate<br>
perpendicular to the billet surface. The present invention involve the secondary cooling zone<br>
modification due to the following reasons:<br>
The existing secondary zone comprising MS zone-0.3 m long with cooling water distribution<br>
rate of 165 Ipm, zone -I -1.5m long having water distribution of 180 Ipm and the zone-IIA -<br>
1.9m long having the water distribution of 80 Ipm; thus the total length of secondary<br>
cooling spreading over 3.7 m, was found to be insufficient as compared to the computed<br>
Crater length of 8-9m, up to end of solidification, while casting was carried out at a speed of<br>
2.2-2.6m/min; further the cooling water distribution/flow rate was independent of casting<br>
speed resulting in strand reheating to an extent of 120°C and leading to formation of<br>
halfway and centerline cracks.<br>
The present invention thus removed the deficiency of the secondary cooling method by<br>
extending the length of the secondary cooling zone by 3.1m by introducing two additional<br>
cooling zones IIB and zone III. Moreover, the water distribution corresponding to different<br>
casting speeds were moderated at different zones of secondary cooling such that the strand<br>
reheating is avoided and the strand reheating is restricted to 
water distribution in different zones of the modified secondary cooling zone, directed to<br>
eliminating formation of halfway/reheat and centerline cracks in concast billets are<br>
presented in the following Table 5.<br>

The present invention is thus directed to a method for high speed casting of superior quality<br>
concast billets led to a significant reduction of internal defects of cast billets in the form of<br>
longitudinal off-corner cracks, halfway/midway/reheat cracks and centerline cracks and blow<br>
holes or pin holes. Thus the resulting cast billets was having higher rigidity and strength<br>
such as to provide a macro section free of appearance of any crack or negligible cracks, as<br>
illustrated in the accompanying Figure 5. Macro acceptance of special quality billets<br>
improved from 
1.8% per strand to 
Figure 7, respectively.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention directed to a method of casting of<br>
superior concast billets at high speed, avoiding occurrences of strand rupture/breakout is<br>
capable to ensure higher acceptance standard of the superior quality concast billets, more<br>
particularly, the forging and spring steel quality cast steel billets by imposing control on<br>
selective chemistry and process parameters, such that the shell thinning, longitudinal off-<br>
corner or centerline crack and the like, responsible for the strand frequent breakouts can be<br>
eliminated and a superior quality billets of higher rigidity and strength is obtained, ensuring<br>
higher plant availability, operational safety and improved productivity at lower costs due to<br>
lesser rejection and as such providing prospects for wide industrial applications.<br>
