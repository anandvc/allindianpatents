				<td>Process for the Post-Modification of Homo and Copolymers Prepared by Controlled Free Radical Polymerization Processes.<br>
The instant invention pertains to the preparation of polymers or copolymers wherein in a first step a controlled free radical polymerization process is carried out and in a second step the resulting polymer is modified by specific polymer analogous reactions. The final modified polymer or copolymer is useful as a dispersant for pigments, as leveling agent or as rheology modifier for coatings or related applications. Further aspects of the invention are the thus prepared polymers or copolymers, a pigment concentrate containing the polymer or copolymer and a coating material containing the pigment concentrate.<br>
Due to environmental pressure, the demand for waterborne coatings and solvent borne high solids coatings will continue to increase in the future in most of the coating segments. Polymeric pigment dispersants are an essential part of new water based or solvent based high solids formulation technology. There is, therefore, an increasing activity in developing new products in these coating areas. So far, only a few classes of polymeric dispersants have been established in the market. In less demanding coating applications, still a lot of low molecular weight surfactants are used. In more demanding applications, e.g. automotive &amp; industrial coatings, polymeric pigment dispersants have to be used to avoid the problems associated with low molecular weight surfactants (water sensitivity, corrosion, foam).<br>
The controlled free radical polymerisation (CFRP) is a tool to tailor the microstructure of polymers (e.g. blockcopolymers) in a way that is favorable for dispersing and stabilizing pigments in the mill-base. The combination of CFRP with subsequent post-modification of the stabilizing block allows enlarging the possible groups that can be used as pigment dispersants. With one CFRP-process a large row of different polymer materials for either waterborne or also solvent-borne high solids systems becomes available.<br>
Although the concept of post-modification of classically prepared polymers is known and, for example, described in DE 4308773, it has not been used broadly, because polymer analogous reactions are in general much more difficult to control, compared to their low molecular weight analogous reactions. Due to the polymeric nature of the substrate, reactions are slower and tend to be incomplete, unless drastic reaction conditions are used such as high temperature or very reactive reagents. However, such measures usually lead to<br><br>
badly defined polymer structures caused by chain scission and cross coupling reactions, resulting in broadening of the molecular weight distribution, branching and gel formation. Another fundamental problem in polymer analogous reactions is, that usually the reaction does not proceed to completion and it is very difficult and costly, if not impossible, to purify the resulting modified polymer from non-converted reagents or unwanted side products.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found, that the post-modification, particularly the transesterification, of polyacrylate polymers made by nitroxyl-mediated controlled free radical polymerization, is possible in significantly higher yields than with classical polymers, without sacrificing the advantages of a well-defined polymer structure, such as low polydispersity.<br>
With the transesterification as post modification technique polymers or copolymers can be prepared in an easy manner, which otherwise would not be available or can be prepared only with complex reactions.<br>
The inventive process comprises a selective polymer-analogous transesterification on polymers, which have been synthesized via nitroxide-mediated polymerization to provide well-defined polymer architectures. This process provides polymers with distinct structural differences compared to polymers with same monomer composition, but synthesized directly from corresponding monomers without post-transesterification.<br>
The main differences are:<br>
1)	Monomer sequence: In direct radical polymerization of two different monomers the<br>
monomer sequence statistics along the polymer chain is governed by the copolymerization<br>
parameters which in most cases will cause deviation from ideal random distribution of the<br>
different monomers. Using the inventive process, the monomer distribution which result from<br>
the transesterification step, is only governed by the transesterification reaction and can be<br>
expected to provide a more uniform i.e. random distribution along the polymer chain.<br>
2)	Residual monomers: Controlled polymerization processes can not be conducted to 100%<br>
conversion without significant decrease in livingness of the polymer chains. In well-defined<br>
block copolymer synthesis, it is therefore necessary to remove the non-reacted monomers of<br>
the first block, before the second block is prolonged with a different monomer. Evaporation at<br>
reduced pressure is the easiest way to remove non-reacted monomers, but works only well<br>
for monomers with boiling point below 200°C. For example acrylates of long chain alcohols<br><br>
like C12-C15-alcohols or MPEG-alcohols can not be removed form polyacrylates by distillation. Therefore it is not possible to make block copolymers of such long chain acrylates with pure block structure free of residual monomers. The inventive process via transesterification circumvents the problem of residual non-removable monomers and associated problems of block contamination, is therefore capable to provide polymers with higher level of structural perfection.<br>
3) Acrylates and methacrylates derived from unsaturated alcohols<br>
Acrylate monomers based on unsaturated alcohols like allyl alcohol or oleyl alcohol usually react as crosslinkers. In conventional radical polymerization as well as in controlled polymerization such acrylates will lead to branching and/or crosslinking, i.e. will prevent the formation of structurally clean linear polymer chains. The inventive process of transesterification allows to introduce unsaturated alcohols to preformed controlled polymers with clean linear chain structure, i.e. provides access to well-defined structures e.g. block copolymers otherwise not accessible by direct radical polymerization.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a process for the preparation of a modified polymer or copolymer comprising the steps<br>
a1) polymerizing in a first step one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the<br>
presence of at least one nitroxylether having the structural element      N—o	X &gt;<br>
/<br>
wherein X represents a group having at least one carbon atom and is such that the free radical X« derived from X is capable of initiating polymerization; or<br>
a2) polymerizing in a first step one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of at least one stable free nitroxyl radical      N~0»   and a free radical<br>
/<br>
initiator; wherein at least one monomer used in the steps a1) or a2) is a Ci-Cg alkyl or hydroxy Ci-C6 alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid; and a second step b) comprising the modification of the polymer or copolymer prepared under a1) or a2) by a transesterification reaction, an amidation, hydrolysis or anhydride modification or a combination thereof.<br><br>
Preferably the first polymerization step is carried out according to the polymerization reactions a1) (Claim 2).<br>
Preferably the second step b) is a transesterification reaction, hydrolysis or an anhydride<br>
modification. Particularly preferred is a transesterification reaction (Claim 3).<br>
The transesterification preferably comprises the removal of the Ci-C6 alcohol byproduct by<br>
distillation.<br>
In a specific embodiment step a1 or a2 of the above described process is carried out twice and a block copolymer is obtained wherein in the first or second radical polymerization step the monomer or monomer mixture contains 50 to 100% by weight, based on total monomers, of a C1-C6 alkyl or hydroxyalkyi ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid and in the second or first radical polymerization step respectively, the ethylenically unsaturated monomer contains no primary or secondary ester bond (Claim 4).<br>
When a block copolymer is prepared it is preferred that in the first polymerization step the monomer or monomer mixture contains from 50 to 100% by weight based on total monomers of a C1-C6 alkyl or hydroxyalkyi ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid and in the second polymerization step the ethylenically unsaturated monomer is 4-vinyl-pyridine or pyridinium-ion, 2-vinyl-pyridine or pyridinium-ion, vinyl-imidazole or imidazolinium-ion, dimethylacrylamide, 3-dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide, styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene or p-tert-butyl-styrene ( Claim 5).<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention the block copolymer is a gradient block copolymer (Claim 6).<br>
As mentioned above it is mandatory that the polymer or copolymer is prepared by controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP). Solomon et al. in US 4,581,429 have firstly described such processes using stable free nitroxyl radicals as controlling agents. These are the steps defined under a1) and a2) above.<br><br>
U.S. 4,581,429 discloses a free radical polymerization process by controlled or "living" growth of polymer chains, which produces defined oligomeric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. Disclosed is the use of initiators of the partial formula R'R"N-0-X. In the polymerization process the free radical species R'R"N-0* and »X &gt; are generated. #X is a free radical group, e.g. a tert.-butyl or cyanoisopropyl radical, capable of polymerizing monomer units containing ethylene groups.<br>
A variation of the above process is disclosed in US 5 322 912 (Xerox) wherein the combined use of a free radical initiator and a stable free radical agent of the basic structure R'R"N-0« I     for the synthesis of homopolymers and block copolymers is described.<br>
These processes are useful for the preparation of homo-, random-, block-, tapered-, graft-or comb (co)polymers, which have a narrow molecular weight distribution and hence a low polydispersity index.<br>
\	For example the structural element    N-O-X or ^N-O* may be part of a cyclic ring system<br>
or substituted to form a acyclic structure.<br>
Suitable nitroxylethers and nitroxyl radicals are principally known from US-A-4 581 429 or EP-A-621 878.<br>
Particularly useful are the open chain compounds described in WO 98/13392 (Akzo), WO 99/03894 (Ciba) and WO 00/07981 (Ciba), the piperidine derivatives described in WO 99/67298 (Ciba) and GB 2335190 (Ciba) or the heterocyclic compounds described in GB 2342649 (Ciba)and WO 96/24620 (Atochem).<br>
Further suitable nitroxylethers and nitroxyl radicals are described in WO 02/4805 (Ciba) and in WO 02/100831 (Ciba).<br>
Nitroxylethers and nitroxyl radicals with more than one nitroxyl group in the molecule are for example described in US 6,573,347(Ciba), WO 01/02345 (Ciba) and WO 03/004471 (Ciba) These compounds are ideally suitable when branched, star or comb (co)polymers are prepared.<br><br>

The polymer or copolymer can also be prepared in a controlled way by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). This type of polymerization is, for example, described in WO 96/30421.<br>
Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) is also a well known controlled free radical polymerization technique and for example described in WO 98/01478, W098/58974, WO 99/31144, WO 99/05099, WO 02/094887, WO 02/26836, WO 01/42312, WO 00/75207, and WO 99/35177.<br>

As already mentioned above the second reaction step, i. e. the polymer analogous reaction, is a transesterification reaction, an amidation, hydrolysis or anhydride modification or a combination thereof.<br>
Hydrolysis means the cleavage of an ester bond under alkaline or acidic conditions and can be carried out when the polymer or copolymer contains ester functionalities. The degree of hydrolysis may vary in a wide range and depends on reaction time and conditions. For example 5 to 100%, preferably 10% to 70% of the ester functionalities may be hydrolized, to form the free acid group, from which also a salt can be prepared. The metal ion is preferably an alkali metal ion, such as Li+, Na+ or Ka+ or an ammonium cation, such as NH4+ or NR404, wherein R404 is hydrogen or C1-C18alkyl.<br>
Anhydride modification can be carried out when the polymer or copolymer contains hydroxy! functionalities. The hydroxy! functionalities come for example from hydroxyl functional monomers, such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate. Virtually all aliphatic or aromatic anhydrides can be used in the modification process. Examples for anhydrides are maleic acid anhydride, pyromelitic acid anhydride, cyclohexyldiacid anhydride, succinic acid anhydride, camphoric acid anhydride.<br>
Transesterification means to replace the alcohol radical in an ester group of the polymer or copolymer by another alcohol radical. Preferably the alcohol radical to be replaced is methanol, ethanol, propanol or butanol. Typically the transesterification reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures, typically 70 - 200°C, by reacting the CFRP polymer with the corresponding alcohol using well-known catalysts, such as tetra-isopropyltitanate, tetra-butyltitanate, alkali- or earth alkali alcoholates like NaOMe or LiOMe. Typically the low boiling product alcohol is removed from the transterification reaction mixture by distillation. If needed, catalyst residues may be removed by adsorption or extraction or otherwise processed or inactivated by known methods, like hydrolysis with water or acids.<br>
The choice of the replacing alcohol is important. The replacing alcohol controls the properties of the resulting copolymer.<br>
Using a polar replacing alcohol such as alcohols having e.g. the following formula R-[0-CH2-CH2-]n-OH, e.g. MPEG-OH, it is possible to obtain a water soluble resulting polymer. Of<br><br>
course the solubility depends on the amount of transesterified monomer units. At least 40 % of the units should be transesterified to obtain the desired effect.<br>
If solubility in organic solvents is required non polar alcohols like higher molecular weight branched aliphatic alcohols can be beneficial.<br>
If polymers with low surface tension are desired, alcohols containing siloxane groups are preferred, e.g. with the following formula<br>
r	3      l<br>
R-f-^i-O-^-R'—CHj-OH CH3<br>
or partly or fully fluorinated primary alcohols can be used instead or in addition.<br>
If a solid copolymer is required, solid alcohols or polar alcohols which are able to raise the glass transition temperature (Tg) or impart side chain crystallinity should be used. An example is behenyl alcohol.<br>
The replacing alcohol radical is typically an aliphatic C6-C36alcohol or a precursor of an alcohol, having at least one -OH group. The alcohol may also be interrupted by 1 to 20 O or N atoms or substituted by halogen, perfluoralkyl, NH2, NH(C1-C18alkyl), N(C1-C18alkyl)2j COO(C1-C18alkyl)f CON(C1-C18alkyl)2, CONH(C1-C18alkyl), CONH2, COOH, COO", 0(Cr C18alkyl) or with a Si, P or S containing group, for example alkylhydroxysilicones.

Ci8alkyl, Rd is hydrogen or methyl and v is a number from 1 to 50. These monomers are for example derived from non ionic surfactants by acrylation of the corresponding alkoxylated alcohols or phenols. The repeating units may be derived from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixtures of both.<br>

Preferably Ra is hydrogen or methyl, Rb is NH2, gycidyl, unsubstituted or with hydroxy substituted C1-C4alkoxyf unsubstituted C1-C4alkylamino, di(C1-C4alkyl)amino, hydroxy-substituted CVdalkylamino or hydroxy-substituted di(C1-C4alkyl)amino; and Z is oxygen.<br>
For example the ethylenically unsaturated monomer is selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, n-butylene, i-butylene, styrene, substituted styrene, conjugated dienes, acrolein, vinyl acetate, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, maleic anhydride, (alkyl)acrylic acid-anhydrides, (alkyl)acrylic acid salts, (alkyl)acrylic esters, (alkyl)acrylonitriles, (alkyl)acryl-amides, vinyl halides or vinylidene halides.<br>

All possible polymer chain structures are comprised: e.g. linear or branched. If the monomers are selected from chemically different monomers, all possible monomer sequence structures are comprised, e.g. random-, blocklike, multiblock-, tapered- or gradient arrangement of the different monomers.<br>
Under gradient polymers or gradient arrangement there are understood block copolymers, which are prepared in such a way, that the intersection between the two blocks is not a sharp boundary, but represents a continuous transition from one type of monomer to another type of monomer, i.e. both monomers extending to both blocks. This type of polymers can be obtained when the polymerization process is carried out for example in one step using monomers of different copolymerization parameters or by a multistep procedure, in which the monomer composition is stepwise changed by addition of appropriate amounts of another type of monomer. Another preferred procedure for the synthesis of gradient polymers is by using continuous feed processes, in which for example the controlled polymerization is started with a first monomer and before complete conversion, a second monomer is continuously fed to the reaction mixture, thus realizing a continuous transition along the polymer chains.<br>
When step a1 or a2 of the process is carried out twice and a block copolymer is obtained for example the monomer or monomer mixture of the first radical polymerization contains from 50 to 100% by weight based on total monomers of a C1-C4 alkyl or hydroxyalkyi ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the second radical polymerization contains a monomer or monomer mixture possessing no primary or secondary ester bond.<br>
Suitable monomers for the second radical polymerization do not react in the postmodification reaction, such as vinyl aromatic monomers or vinyl-aza-heterocycles.<br>
Examples are 4-vinyl-pyridine(pyridinium-ion), 2-vinyl-pyridine(pyridinium-ion), vinyl-imida-zole(imidazolinium-ion), dimethylacrylamide, acrylnitrile, 3-dimethylaminopropylmethacryl-amide, styrene or substituted styrenes .<br>
Naturally the sequence of the first and second radical polymerization can also be reversed.<br><br>
When a block copolymer is prepared it is preferred that in the first polymerization the monomer or monomer mixture contains from 50 to 100% by weight based on total monomers of a CrC6 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid and in the second polymerization the ethylenically unsaturated monomer is 4-vinyl-pyridine or pyridinium-ion, 2-vinyl-pyridine or pyridinium-ion, vinyl-imidazole or imidazolinium-ion, dimethylacrylamide, 3-dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide, styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene or p-tert-butyl-styrene.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, the monomers of the controlled polymer prepared according to a first step a1) or a2) contain aminic or acid groups, is than modified in a second step by a transesterification reaction, an amidation, hydrolysis or anhydride modification and thereafter the aminic or acid groups of the modified controlled polymer are converted to salt structures by reaction with a salt forming component. Typical salt forming components for amino groups are for example organic or inorganic acids or alkylhalogenides, especially such salt forming components, which are based on organic cyclic acids or cyclic alkylhalogenides. Typical examples of such salt forming components are described in EP 1275689 (Ciba) and WO 03/046029 (Ciba)<br>
Typical salt forming components for acid groups on the modified controlled polymer are inorganic bases, such as NaOH, KOH, NH40H or volatile aminoalcohols, such as 2-di-methylaminoethanol or 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP), which are frequently used in coatings.<br>
It is also possible to choose the monomers in the polymerization steps and the post modification reaction in such a way, that a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in water or water rich solvent mixtures is obtained for the final polymer or copolymer.<br>
This means, that the polymer or copolymer shows a good solubility at low temperatures and a decreasing solubility at high temperatures. This effect is for example described by Hammouda, B.; Ho, D.; Kline, S in Macromolecules (2002), 35(22), 8578-8585).<br>
Consequently in a further specific embodiment of the invention, the process is carried out such, that the resulting polymer shows a lower critical solution temperature in water or water rich solvent mixtures.<br><br>
Especially preferred are modified polymers with an LCST temperature range at 20 % polymer by weight based on the water or water mixture between 25°C and 80°C.<br>
As already outlined above waterborne coatings will continue to increase in most of the coating segments in the next years. Polymeric pigment dispersants are an essential part, particularly of new waterbased formulation technology. The controlled free radical polymerisation (CFRP) is a tool to tailor the microstructure of polymers (e.g. block-copolymers) in a way that is favorable for the dispersion and stabilization of pigments in the millbase. The combination of CFRP with subsequent postmodification of the stabilizing block allows enlarging the possible groups that can be used in pigment dispersants.<br>
Consequently the use of a polymer or copolymer prepared according to the above process as pigment dispersant or rheology modifieror leveling agent is also an aspect of the invention. (Claim 17)<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a polymer or copolymer obtainable in a process as<br>
described above.(Claim 16). As outlined on page 2 of the description the process according to claim 1 provides polymers with distinct structural differences compared to polymers with same monomer composition, but synthesized directly from corresponding monomers without post-transesterification.<br>
The definitions and preferences given for the process apply also for the other aspects of the invention.<br>

The pigments may be single chemical compounds or mixtures of a plurality of components, including solid solutions or mixed crystals containing a plurality of chemical compounds. Preference is given to uniformly crystalline pigments as they usually yield greater color saturation than physical mixtures and mixed phases. If duller shades are nevertheless desired in the final application, this may be achieved by toning down with colorants of different color in a manner known per se.<br>
The pigment concentrate may contain additional solvents, in particular water.<br>

5.	Alkyd resins, polyester resins and acrylate resins crosslinked with melamine resins, urea resins, isocyanates, isocyanurates, polyisocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
6.	Crosslinked epoxy resins derived from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic glycidyl compounds, e.g. products of diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and bisphenol F, which are crosslinked with customary hardeners such as anhydrides or amines, with or without accelerators.<br>
The cross linking alkyd resins which can be used as film forming binder resins in the present invention are the conventional stoving lacquers which are used in particular for coating automobiles (automobile finishing lacquers), for example lacquers based on alkyd/melamine resins and alkyd/acrylic/melamine resins (see H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, "Lackkunstharze" (1977), pages 99-123). Other crosslinking agents include glycouril resins, blocked isocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
The coating compositions may be applied on wood, metal or plastic substrates.<br>
The instant coating compositions are particularly suitable both for metal finish coatings and solid shade finishes of automobiles, especially in the case of retouching finishes, as well as various coil coating applications. The coating compositions in accordance with the invention are preferably applied in the conventional manner by two methods, either by the single-coat method or by the two-coat method. In the latter method, a pigment-containing base coat is applied first and then a covering coat of clear lacquer over it.<br>
When water-soluble, water miscible or water dispersible coatings are desired ammonium salts of acid groups present in the resin are formed. Powder coating composition can be prepared by reacting glycidyl methacrylate with selected alcohol components.<br>
Powder coating is a known technology and is described, for example, in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Fifth, Completely Revised Edition, Volume A 18", pages 438 to 444 (1991). In the powder coating process, a powder is generally fluidized with supply of air, electrostatically charged and applied to an earthed, preferably metallic substrate. The substrate is subsequently heated, in the course of which the adhering powder melts, coalesces and forms a coherent film on the metal surface. Since powder coating requires no solvent, this technology is especially friendly to the environment.<br><br>
By powder coatings there are meant thermoplastic or stovable, crosslinkable polymers which are applied in powder form to predominantly metallic substrates. The manner in which the powder is brought into contact with the workpiece to be coated characterizes the various application techniques, for example electrostatic powder spraying with corona or triboelectric pistols, electrostatic fluidized-bed sintering or by using magnetic brush technology.<br>
Examples of organic film-forming binders for powder coatings are stoving systems based on, for example, epoxy resins, polyester-hydroxyalkylamides, polyester-glycolurils, epoxy-polyester resins, polyester-triglycidyl isocyanurates, hydroxy-functional polyester-blocked polyisocyanates, hydroxy-functional polyester-uretdiones, acrylate resins with hardener or mixtures of such resins. Also of interest are film-forming binders having thermoplastic properties, for example polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamides, polyvinyl chlorides, polyvinylidene dichloride or polyvinylidene difluoride.<br>
It is to be understood that the inventive compositions containing the modified controlled polymers as dispersants or rheology modifiers also comprise coating related applications outside paints, like for example printing inks, Inkjet inks, liquid colorants for plastics, casting resins, gel coats, filled unsaturated polyester resins like SMC or BMC (sheet molding compounds, bulk molding compounds) or gel coats and also comprise compositions for electronic applications like pigment dispersions for color filters.<br>

Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine<br>

Example 1: White pigmented powder coatings based on a carboxvl-functional polyester and<br>
a hvdroxvalkvlamide as a hardener.<br>
The  powder coating  composition  is  based  on  a  carboxy-functional  polyester,<br>
components 1 to 6 (formulation containing the levelling agent) as indicated in Table<br>
1. <br>
a)	Crylcoat® 2532 from UCB S.A., Drogenbos, Belgium<br>

j)       Polymer A18<br>
The components are mixed using a planetary stirrer. The mixture is then extruded on a prism extruder at 300 revolutions/minute at 110°C and is rolled out. The powder coating :omposition is coarsely comminuted using a bench cutter and is ground in a Retsch ZM-1 jltracentrifugal mill with a 0.75 mm annular-perforation screen at 15,000 revolutions/minute. :inally, the powder is passed through a 125 ^m sieve on a centrifugal sieving machine laving an average particle size of from 30 to 50 ^m.<br>
"he finished powder coating composition is sprayed electrostatically to a coat thickness of 70 o 80 urn onto aluminium panels using an ESB-Wagner corona cup gun at 60 kV. The coated &gt;anels are cured in an electric oven at 200° C for 10 minutes.<br>
"he following parameters are determined:<br>
) yellowness: b* ISO 7724 (ASTM D 2244). Large values of b* denote strong yellowing.<br>
:) gloss @ 20°  measured with a  BYK Gardner haze-gloss in accordance with the<br>
nanufacturer's suggested method of operation. High gloss values indicate high reflectance<br>
f the coating films.<br>
) DOI (BYK) with a BYK Gardner wave-scan DOI in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
uggested method of operation. While a DOI value at zero is for a perfect diffusion, a DOI<br>
alue of 100 means a perfect mirror image indicating a very smooth surface.<br>
) Longwave with a BYK Gardner wave-scan DOI in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
uggested method of operation. Longwave values of lesser magnitude are indicative for<br>
oatings that are smoother in appearance.<br><br>

Table 6: Results after curing for 30 minutes at 140°C<br><br>
These results demonstrate that the inventive block copolymer A17 shows comparable performance at lower dosage compared to a commercial benchmark levelling agent. In<br><br>
addition it has a solid 100% active product form, which is more convenient in handling and what offers significant advantages in production of powder paints. Usual commercial polyacrylate levelling agents are either liquid or sticky resins or are adsorbed on solid silica carrier.<br>
3) Application testing for non-polar formulations<br>
Commercial polyacrylate pigment dispersants are not fully soluble in non-polar solvents like pure aliphatic hydrocarbons. The solubility of the inventive copolymers was tested in an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent Shell Catenex 925, which serves as a model for extreme non-polar formulations.<br>
At 10 wt% polymer the inventive copolymers A11, A13 and A15 showed full solubility. This is in contrast to typical commercial polyacrylate dispersants like Efka-4401, which was tested in comparison and formed turbid inhomogeneous mixture.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
