A signal is transmitted at a transmit power and includes a traffic channel transmitted at a traffic channel transmit power, and a pilot channel transmitting at a pilot channel transmit power. The receive energy of the pilot channel is measured, and a decrease power control command is generating when the receive energy is greater than a receive energy threshold. If the receive energy is less than the receive energy threshold, an increase power control command is generated. The power control command is transmitted to the system generating the signal.</td>

a reverse link transmit power includes at least a traffic channel transmitted at a traffic channel transmit power, and a pilot channel transmitted at a pilot channel transmit power. At a receive system the receive energy of the pilot channel is measured, and a decrease power control command is generating when the receive energy is greater than a receive energy threshold. If the receive energy is less than the receive energy threshold an increase power control command is generated. The power control command is transmitted to the system generating the reverse link signal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for performing transmit power control at a subscriber unit on a reverse link signal transmitted at a reverse link transmit power, wherein the reverse link signal has a traffic channel transmitted at a traffic channel transmit power, and a pilot channel transmitted at a pilot channel transmit power, comprising the steps of: measuring at a base station a receive energy of the reverse link pilot channel; generating a power control command in accordance with a comparison of said receive energy measurement with an energy threshold, wherein said power control command comprises an increase or decrease command; receiving said power control command at said subscriber unit; examining said power control command at said subscriber unit to determine whether the command is to be applied to either the reverse link traffic channel, the reverse link pilot channel, or the entire reverse link signal; and selectively adjusting the transmit power of either the reverse link pilot channel, the reverse link traffic channel, or the entire reverse link signal in accordance with the examining step.<br>
The present invention also provides a system for performing transmit power control at a subscriber unit on a reverse link signal transmitted at a<br><br>
reverse link transmit power, wherein the reverse link signal has a traffic channel transmitted at a traffic channel transmit power, and a pilot channel transmitted at a pilot channel transmit power, comprising: power control system that measures at a base station a receive energy of the reverse link pilot channel, for generating a power control command in accordance with a comparison of said receive energy measurement with an energy threshold, wherein said power control command comprises an increase or decrease command; receiver at said subscriber unit that receives said power control command; examination system that examines at said subscriber unit said power control command to determine whether the command is to be applied to either the reverse link traffic channel, the reverse link pilot channel, or the entire reverse link signal; and a power controller that selectively adjusts the transmit power of either the reverse link pilot channel, the reverse link traffic channel, or the entire reverse link signal in accordance with said examination by said examination system.<br>
The features, objects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings in which like reference characters identify correspondingly throughout and wherein:<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a cellular telephone system;<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a subscriber unit or cellular telephone configured in accordance with one embodiment of the invention; and<br>
FIG 3 is a block diagram of a base station configured in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a subscriber unit or cellular telephone configured with one embodiment of the invention. During operation encoder 12 convolutionally encodes user data 10 to generate encoded symbols 14. User data 10 is typically vocoded voice information provided at a variable data rate, although any type of digital data may be transmitted. The user data is processed in 20 ms increments, or frames, in which the amount of data contained in each frame varies in response to changes in the data rate.<br>
Traffic channel modulator 16 modulates encoded symbols 14 with a traffic channel code to generate traffic channel symbols 18. Additionally, traffic channel modulator 16 increases or decreases the gain of the traffic channel in response to channel gain adjust command 62 as described below. The gain of the traffic channel is further adjusted by traffic channel modulator 16 in response to changes in the amount of data being transmitted during each 20 ms<br>
frame<br><br><br><br><br>
