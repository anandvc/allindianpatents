(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SKIN LIGHTENING AGENTS COMPRISING COURMARIN DERIVED FROM RESORCINOL DERIVATIVES<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.                   GRANTED<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br><br><br><br>
19-4-2007<br><br>
The invention relates to cosmetic methods of using coumarin derived compounds and cosmetic compositions including the same, and more specifically, coumarin derived resorcinol derivatives as skin lightening agents.<br>
Many people are concerned with the degree of pigmentation of their skin.  For example, people with age spots or freckles may wish such pigmented spots to be less pronounced.  Others may wish to reduce the skin darkening caused by exposure to sunlight or to lighten their natural skin color.  To meet this need, many attempts have been made to develop products that reduce the pigment production in the melanocytes. However, the substances identified thus far tend to have either low efficacy or undesirable side effects, such as, for example, toxicity or skin irritation.  Therefore, there is a continuing need for new skin lightening agents, with improved overall effectiveness.<br>
Resorcinol derivatives have cosmetic skin and hair benefits. Certain resorcinol derivatives, particularly 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives, are useful in cosmetic compositions for skin lightening benefits.  Resorcinol derivatives are described in many publications, including Hu et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,132,740, European Patent Application. EP 1 134 207, and Japanese published patent applications JP 2001-010925 and JP2000-327557.  Resorcinol derivatives are known compounds and can be readily obtained by various means, including by a method wherein a saturated carboxylic acid and resorcinol are condensed in the presence of zinc chloride,<br><br><br>
and the resultant condensate is reduced with zinc amalgam/hydrochloric acid (Lille, et al.,Tr. Nauch-Issled. Inst. Slantsev 1969, No. 18:127-134), or by a method wherein resorcinol and a corresponding alkyl alcohol are reacted in . the presence of an alumina catalyst at a high temperature of from 200 to 400° C (British Patent No. 1,581,428).  Some of  these compounds can be irritating to the skin.<br>
The applicants have now discovered that the use of compounds that which may be derived from coumarin derivatives (although not limited to such process) deliver skin lightening benefits.  The general chemical formulas and structures of these compounds is discussed in more detail herein below. Hydroxy coumarin derived compounds, and especially 7-hydroxy-coumarin derived compounds which resemble resorcinol derivatives, have been found to be effective and possibly less irritating to the skin.  These compounds are referred to -herein as "coumarin derived resorcinol derivatives."<br>
Aminophenol derivatives have been described as optical brighteners in, for example, Chevalier et al. , U.S. Patent . Application No. 6, 403,065.  Wella AG, German Patent Application DE 20110355 relates to preparation of (dihydroxyphenyl)acrylamide derivatives and compositions containing hair coloring agents.  However, coumarin derived resorcinol 'derivatives of the present invention have not been used for lightening skin.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, the use of compounds of the general formula I, and compositions including the same, deliver skin lightening benefits with potential reduced<br><br><br>
irritation.  The present invention providesa cosmetic method of skin lightening using a composition comprising in<br>
r<br>
addition to a cosmetically acceptable vehicle, about 0.000001 % to about 50 % of a compound of formula I,<br><br>
where each or both R1 and/or R2 represents hydrogen; linear or<br>
branched C1 - C18 alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkenyl, acyl, cycloacyl, or alkoxy groups.  Preferably, one of R1 or R2 represents hydrogen, and the other of R1 or R2 represents an alkoxy group; more preferably, the alkoxy group is CH2CH20Me or CH2CH2CH20Me, and<br>
each or both R3 and/or R4, which may be connected by a single or double carbon-carbon bond (shown as a dotted line) , represents hydrogen; linear or branched § - C18 alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, cycloalkyl, or cycloalkenyl group.<br>
Preferably, R3 and R4 are connected, by a double carbon-carbon<br>
bond, and both represent hydrogen, andR5 and/or R6  may be positioned at the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and/or 6- positions on the phenyl ring.  Each or both R5 and/or R6 represents preferably<br>
a hydrogen atom, OH, C1-C4 acyl group, C1-C4 alkyl group, 0-<br>
CO-R7, O-COO-Rs group, mesyl group or tosyl group, where each<br>
or both R7 and/or R8  represents hydrogen; linear or branched<br>
C1 - C18 alkyl, alkenyl, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkenyl, acyl, cycloacyl, or alkoxy groups. In a preferred embodiment, each or both'R5 and/'or Rg represents OH.  In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, both R5 and Rg represent OH. . This more<br>
preferred embodiment, refered to herein as 7-hydroxy-coumarin- derivatives, or coumarin aetived resorcinol derivatives, may be prepared by reaction of methylamine with 7-hydroxy-coumarin . by a method known in the art.  The<br>
hydroxy groups (R5 and Rg) , as well as the R3 and R4 groups<br>
may be further substituted by methods known in the art.<br>
Further skin benefit agents may be included in the compositions useful for the inventive method.  Organic and inorganic sunscreens may also be included.<br>
The inventive compositions and methods have effective skin lightening properties, may be less irritating to the skin, and are cost-effective.<br>
As.used herein, the term "cosmetic composition" is intended to describe compositions for topical application to human skin.<br>
The term "skin" as used herein includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, axilla, hands, legs, and scalp.<br><br><br>
Except in the examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about".  All amounts are by weight of the composition, unless otherwise specified.<br>
It should be noted that in specifying any range of concentration, any particular upper concentrationcan be associated with any particular lower concentration.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt the word "comprising" is intended to mean including but not necessarily consisting of or composed of.  In other words the listed steps or options need not be exhaustive.<br>
The invention is concerned with the use of compounds of general formula I, shown below, and compositions including the same, as skin lightening agents.  A particular advantage of the inventive compositions and methods is that compounds of general formula I can be less  irritating to the skin than skin lightening compounds with similar structure, such as 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives <br><br><br>

Example 12<br>
This example shows the skin lightening effect of using 7-hydroxy-coumarin derived resorcinol compounds as skin lightening agents in accordance with the inventive method. This experiment was carried out using a cell based assay.<br>
B16 mouse melanoma cells were utilized in the following experiment to evaluate the efficacy of skin lightening agents.  B16 cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 5000 cells per well and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (phenol red free) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin/<br>
streptomycin, at 3 7°C in the presence of 5 % CO2.  After 24<br>
hours, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium containing the treatments.<br>
All cultures were incubated for 72 hours at which time melanin was visible in the control treatment.  The melanin-containing medium was transferred to a clean 96-well plate and quantified by reading the absorbency at 53 0-nm.  Cell viability was,assessed by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase levels to ensure the decrease in melanin was not a result of cellular toxicity.<br>

From the results tabulated above it appears that coumarin derived resoreinol compounds of the present invention reduce melanin synthesis to about the same or better degree than 4-ethyl resoreinol.<br>
Example 13.  Mushroom Tyrosinase Assay<br>
Mushroom tyrosinase inhibition is indicative of reduction in melanin synthesis, thereby showing skin lightening effect. This experiment shows the efficacy of coumarin derived resorcinol derivatives of the present invention.<br>
Into each well of a 96-well plate, 150 microliters of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0), 10 microliters of L-DOPA (L-3, 4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine, 10 mM), and 20 microliters of skin lightening agent (dissolved in ethanol, which is the control) were added.  Following an initial measurement of background absorbency at 475-nm, 20 microliters of mushroom tyrosinase (Sigma T-7755; 6050 units/ml) was added and incubated at room temperature.<br>
Absorbency is read at 475-nm over the following time points: 0, 2, 4, and 6.5 minutes.  The data is plotted as 475-nm absorbency vs. time (minutes) and the slope of the line is calculated (AAbs 475nm/ min) .  Values are expressed as the percentage of the respective untreated ethanol control reaction.<br>
