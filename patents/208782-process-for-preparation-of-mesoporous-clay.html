"PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF MESOPOROUSLLAY<br><br>
INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LIMITED, a Public Limited Company, having its Head Office at G-9, AIi Yavar Jung Marg, Bandra (East), Mumbai 400 051, India.<br>
The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
11-2-2005<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing clay having meso pores (pore size in the range of 80 to 120 A) which comprises reacting phosphoric acid and clay and aging the reaction mixture for at least 4 hours to obtain clay having meso-pores while maintaining its surface area. The clay thus obtained can act both as a catalyst for cracking lower bottoms in hydrocarbon conversion reactions and also as an active base to support conventional catalysts used in cracking, hydrocracking, reforming, isomensation and other refining processes. The availability of pore sizes in the range of 80 to 120A is responsible for bottom cracking of heavy residues. The present invention also provides a novel catalyst system for hydrocarbon conversion reactions comprising an active clay support having meso pores (pore size in the range of 80-120 A) and a conventional zeolite catalyst.<br>
Background and Prior Art References:<br>
Certain types of clays are long known for their use in catalysis, especially in high temperature reactions like cracking, hydrocracking, etc. Prior to invention of zeolites, clays were widely used in cracking catalysis. The reasons for their use are many: they are cheap, abundantly available in relatively pure form, high temperature resistant and easy to handle. The clays were subjected to acid/base treatments before use. With the invention of zeolite with their magnificent acid properties, shape selectivity and reactivity, clays started to loose their importance as prime active component though, they continued to be used as diluents and heat reservoirs or heat sinks. The alternative roles, the clays played, were no less important. They were supposed to protect the active zeolite component from destruction during the course of reactions. During the last 50 years, clay is the dominant component for processes like Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), Hydrocracking etc. The use of clay in the prior art can be described in the following areas, (1) Catalyst (2) Support and (3) Binder. Let us discuss the role of clay as perceived in these uses.<br>
Catalyst:<br>
Catalytic use was confined to earlier days prior to zeolite The limitations were many Reaction on clay catalysts was non -selective and life was limited.<br><br>
Support:<br>
During the last 50 years clay was mainly used as support but inactive support, while other components like silica-alumina, alumina etc are often used as active matrix. They take part in the primary reactions and subsequently the active component, i.e. zeolite takes over. The acid treated clay used in the earlier days was very non-selective and often generated more coke in the cracking reactions. There is a gap in the research domain regarding conscious use of clay as active support in cracking and other reactions.<br>
Binder:<br>
In the last decade, clay is finding increasing use as binder A cheap binder. Many researchers attempted to impart secondary properties in clay. However, binding remained the major area where considerable work is done.<br>
Gap areas:<br>
Let us consider clay as active support. Clay is an ideal material for cracking if suitable porosity is generated insitu. Which pores are important? Zeolite has a fixed pore size; it does not allow entry of molecules bigger than this size. Conventional alumina or silica alumina matrix has pore sizes ranging from 80-100 angstroms and above. Any attempt to synthesize pores in the post-zeolite range between 20-100 is difficult. These pores in a conventional silica alumina matrix is unstable and decomposes under hydrothermal conditions. Can meso pores of required sizes be created on clay itself, can support materials for catalyst be' prepared using this pore modified clay, will this clay remain active under severe hydro thermal conditions, these are a few of many unanswered questions which are bothering researchers in the field for quite some time.<br>
However while looking for solutions to these problems one has to take care of undesirable reactions which reactive clay may induce. It has been rightly pointed out in United States Patent 5,288,739 by Demmel that "independent catalytic activity has proved to be an advantage in catalyzing some chemical reactions, but a disadvantage in catalyzing many others ... many of these glue or binder materials also are chemically reactive with many of the different kinds of catalyst particles they are called upon to bind together. Such chemical reactivity between a given binder material and a given species of catalyst particle may be an advantage in some cases, but generally speaking it is not considered to be an advantage; and in many cases it may well<br><br>
constitute a serious detriment to the catalytic activity of a given species of catalyst". So while designing a pore modified active clay support it is necessary to see to it that this activity do not interfere with the primary activity of the major catalyst components.<br>
US patent 5,231,064 (Absil et al.) describes use of phosphate treated clays as a component for FCC catalyst formulation. Absil et al. envisages use of clay as a low cost component which ensures attrition resistance to the active zeolite catalyst and not as an active catalyst in itself. The object of the process of Absil et al. was to increase the attrition resistance of the catalyst. However, in the present invention, the main purpose is to develop meso-pores having pore size in the range of 20-100 A. Further, the attrition resistant catalyst produced by Absil et al. has improved activity for gasoline octane enhancement or light olefin production in the catalytic cracking of crude oil. However, the clay produced in the present invention shows improved lower bottom cracking. Thus, the objects and also the utility of the present invention and Absil et al. are totally different.<br>
It is essential to notice that the contact time between the phosphoric acid and the clay as described in Absil et al. should be less than 95 minutes, preferably less than 30 minutes and most preferably less than 15 minutes, which is not sufficient to develop meso-pores in the clay. By performing the process as described by Absil et al., the Applicants have found that the average pore diameter of the clay thus obtained is always greater than the average pore size of the base clay taken at the starting and always lies above 130 A. Thus, meso-pores are not developed in the clay by following the process of Absil et al.<br>
The Applicants have surprisingly found that if the contact time between the clay particles and the phosphoric acid is long, preferably not less than 3 hours and most preferably not less than 4 hours, meso-pores are developed in the clay.<br>
Thus, Absil et al does not teach or suggest the process of developing meso-pores in the clay and a person of ordinary skill in the art will not be able to envisage the novel step of developing meso-pores in the clay by reading Absil et al.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a process for preparing clay having meso-pores for use as a catalyst for cracking lower bottoms in hydrocarbon conversion reactions and also as an active base to support conventional catalysts.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop a process for preparing clay having an<br>
average pore diameter of 80-120A and capable of reducing undesirable bottoms during the<br>
process of cracking.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel catalyst system for<br>
hydrocarbon conversion reactions comprising an active clay support having meso pores (pore<br>
size in the range of 80-120 A) and a conventional zeolite catalyst.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>

the range of 80 to 120 A) while maintaining its surface area which comprises reacting<br>
phosphoric acid and clay and aging the reaction mixture for at least 4 hours. The clay thus<br>

A graphical representation of this pore size distribution is shown in Figure 1 in the form of bar chart. The data is shown for the base clay or the starting clay and two clay samples A and C modified as per the process of the present invention and in accordance with examples 1 and 3.<br>
Figure 1 shows significant increase in number of pores having diameter in the lower regions i.e. between 15 and 150 A for samples A and C. It is to be noted that, irrespective of prior calcination of clay samples, the final modified clay contain such tailored porosity. This effect is more when the final clay is washed to remove the leached alumina atoms. Thus modified clay in final dried form could be used as catalyst or catalyst support. Also, modified clay in the slurry form could be used as support in any aqueous precursor slurry for catalyst.<br><br>
The pore-modified clay prepared as per the process of this invention has many useful properties which could be put to use in catalysis in general and refining catalysis in particular. As specific examples of use, the following can be sited, however they are not limiting.<br>
1.	As Catalyst support<br>
2.	As Bottom Cracking Component<br>
We shall now discuss in brief the above examples.<br>
Catalyst Support: Cracking catalyst using pore modified clay of the present invention is made as per the following preferred embodiment. Pore modified clay slurry prepared by the process of present invention is added to finely dispersed alumina and the resulting mixture is combined with a solution of zeolite powder under high shear mixing conditions to obtain a spray drier feed slurry that contains 20 to 45 wt% solids which preferably comprises (on a dry basis) 1 to 10 wt% alumina, 4-8 wt% phosphate, 0.3-10 wt% zeolite and 70 to 90 wt% kaolin. The catalyst slurry is held in a spray dryer feed storage tank under mixing conditions and is spray dried at a temperature of 200°C to 400°C and calcined for 1 hour at a temperature of 450-600 °C.<br>
In the present invention, part of the clay can be substituted with other finely divided inorganic components such as other types of clays, silica, alumina, silica-alumina gels and sols may be included.<br>
The paniculate spray dried catalyst has a particle size range of 20 to 150 microns, preferably 20-120 microns and is held in catalyst storage container prior to use. The catalyst may be used as in a conventional FCC unit wherein the it is reacted with a hydrocarbon feedstock at 400 to 700°C, preferably at 400-600°C and regenerated at 500 to 850T, preferably at 500-750X, to remove coke.<br>
Typically the catalyst possesses an attrition index of 3-15, and preferably 5-10, as determined by the IOC Attrition Index Test described as follows The catalyst samples were calcined at 538 °C for 3 hours prior to measurement for attrition resistance (index). In the method catalyst attrition at high, constant air jet velocity was measured The fines were removed continuously from the attrition zone by elutriation into a flask-thimble assembly, and weighed at periodic intervals. It is assumed that the test conditions are similar to those encountered in hydrocarbon conversion<br><br>
operations. The attrited or overhead catalyst so measured is expressed as the weight percent overhead. Percent attrition is calculated as follows:<br>
Grams overhead in 5-20 hours period * 100 50 gnu (initial) charge — gms overhead in 0-5 hrs. peri<br>
Percent attrition is also referred to as attrition index. Lower the index, better is the attrition index property of catalyst.<br>
Spray drying of gas inlet/outlet temperature of 300 to 350°C/100-200°C is used in the preparation of FCC catalysts. This catalyst could be used to crack feedstock such as gas-oil, residual oil and mixtures thereof<br>
Bottom Cracking Component: The pore-modified clay prepared as per the process of this invention can be used as a bottom cracking component also. The presence of higher amount of meso pores in the range of 20-90A is conducive in accommodating bulkier hydrocarbon molecules which form the major part of high boiling fractions named as bottom. Presence of meso pores and secondary acid centers due to uprooted alumina molecules makes cracking of bottoms easier. Catalyst made as per process above when evaluated for bottom cracking confirm this and is shown in the Table 5 elsewhere in this application.<br>
Having described the basic aspect of our invention the following specific examples are given to illustrate specific preferred embodiments,<br>
Example-1: Uncalcined clay<br>
1064 gm of kaolin clay was freshly ground and clay slurry having from 50 to 70 weight percent clay was prepared by adding 821 gm of demmeralised water (DM) to the clay. The pH of the slurry was reduced by addition of phosphoric acid to a level which is conducive to formation of a viscous mass complex. The clay slurry is then provided with phosphate ions by introducing therein 122g of phosphoric acid (85 wt %, LR grade, SD Fine Chem, Mumbai, India) solution such that the clay particles ultimately made from the slurry comprises of about 20 to about 40 weight percent phosphate and from about 60 to about 80 weight percent clay. The slurry was aged for 4 hours and then dried at 110 °C for 16 hours to produce solid clay particles. The solid clay particles thus obtained are calcined at 500°C for 1 hour to produce pore modified clay particles. The product is identified as A.<br><br>
  Example-2: Clay calcined at 500°C<br>
1064 gm of kaolin clay calcined at 500°C for 1 hour was freshly ground and clay slurry having from 50 to 70 weight percent clay was prepared by adding 821 gm of demineralised water to the clay. The pH of the slurry was reduced by addition of phosphoric acid to a level which is conducive to formation of an viscous mass complex. The clay slurry is then provided with phosphate ions by introducing therein 122g of phosphoric acid (85 wt %, LR grade, SD Fine Chem, Mumbai, India) solution such that the clay particles ultimately made from the slurry comprises of about 20 to about 40 weight percent phosphate and from about 60 to about 80 weight percent clay. The slurry was aged for 4 hours and then dried at 110°C for 16 hours to produce solid clay particles. The solid clay particles are calcined at 500°C for 1 hour to produce pore modified clay particles. The product is identified as B.<br>
Example-3: Clay calcined at 900°C<br>
1064 gm of kaolin clay calcined at 900°C for 1 hour was freshly ground and clay slurry having from 50 to 70 weight percent clay was prepared by adding 821 gm of demineralised water to the clay. The pH of the slurry was reduced by addition of phosphoric acid to a level which is conducive to formation of an viscous mass complex. The clay slurry is men provided with phosphate ions by introducing therein 122g of phosphoric acid (85 wt %, LR grade, SD Fine Chem, Mumbai, India) solution such that the clay particles ultimately made from the slurry comprises of about 20 to about 40 weight percent phosphate and from about 60 to about 80 weight percent clay. The slurry was aged for 4 hours and then dried at 110 °C for 16 hours to produce solid particles and calcined at 500°C for 1 hour to produce pore modified clay particles. The product is identified as C. The average pose size values of these clays are given in table 2. These data were generated by nitrogen adsorption studies on modified clay samples.<br>

Example-4: Formulation of cracking catalyst using pore modified active clay support<br>
2008 gm pore modified active clay support slurry prepared as per example 1, having pH of 1.2 was taken in a.10 liter container and kept under stirring. To this slurry, 625 gm of alumina with a solid content of 20wt% and pH of 8.5 was added under stirring. The mixture was homogenized by vigorous stirring for 10 minutes and the pH of the mixture was recorded as 2.5. 130.21 gm of ZSM-5 zeolite (procured from M/s Zeolysl, USA) with moisture content of 4 wt%, was ground to a fine paste with equal amount of de-mineralized water and 0.35 wt% of hexa sodium metaphosphate (based on volatile free zeolite) and added to support-alumina slurry mixture under stirring. Stirring was continued for another 10 minutes, pH was recorded as 2.9. Final slurry with solid concentration of 30-wt %, was spray dried with a feed rate of 80 g/min. Spray dried micro spheres were then calcined at 500 °C for 1 hour.<br>
Calcined catalyst micro spheres were sieved and fraction between, 100 and 325 mesh were considered. This fraction was selected for further characterization. The catalyst was analyzed for surface area, which was found to be 49 m2/g. Physical properties of the catalyst prepared as per the present invention are provided below in table 3.<br>

Property	Value<br>
Surface Area (m2/g)	49<br>
Average Bulk Density	0.79<br>
Attrition Index (wt%)	3.5<br>
The calcined catalyst was steam deactivated at 750°C for 3 hrs and was evaluated for performance at Simulated MAT conditions with standard feed. The readings of the same are given in Table 4.<br>
