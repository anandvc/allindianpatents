Amide-containing polymers for rheology control<br>
The invention relates to amide-containing polymers for the control of rheology in liquid polymer systems such as, for example, solvent-borne, solvent-free and aqueous coating materials, PVC plastisols, epoxide-based coatings and unsaturated polyester resins.<br>
To control the rheology of liquid systems it is common to use silicas, hydrogenated castor oil or organically modified bentonites, as described for example in US 4,208,218, US 4,410,364 and US 4,412,018. Polyamide waxes as well are widely employed. Within the field of polyamides and polyamide esters there exist numerous patents, such as DE 69523221, EP 0528363, EP 0239419, US 5,510,452 and US 5,349,011 for example. Use is also made, however, of combinations of modified bentonites with polyamides, as described in EP 0509202 and DE 69704691.<br>
Disadvantageous features of these materials include the fact that they are usually dry solids or pastes, which have to be converted to a semi-finished product by means of solvents and application of shearing forces, and/or introduced into liquid coating systems, for example, by means of specific temperature control. Unless the necessary temperatures are observed, the finished coating system will contain crystallites, which lead to defects in the coating. The general disadvantage of these materials is that they result in turbidity and haze in clear, transparent coatings. Moreover, the handling of dry products, which give rise to dusts in processing, is undesirable.<br>
The polyamide esters, although they are frequently liquid, are nevertheless significantly less effective than the inherently solid materials.<br><br>

Other solutions to rheology control have been set out in EP 0 198 519. There an isocyanate is reacted with an arnine in the presence of binders to form a urea which forms acicular crystals in a very finely disperse form. These modified binders are offered as rheology-controlling and sag-preventing binders, and are termed sag control agents.<br>
The disadvantage of these products is that they are always attached to the binders in which they have been produced, and, consequently, the subsequent universal correction of existing systems is not a possibility.<br>
EP 0 006 252 describes a process for preparing a thixotropic agent that removes some of the disadvantages referred to above, by providing urea urethanes which are prepared in aprotic solvents in the presence of LiCl by reaction of isocyanate adducts with polyamines. The disadvantage of the products thus prepared lies in the undefined structure of the urea urethanes, which is caused by the preparation process. In the course of the said process, diisocyanates and monoalcohols are employed in equal molar amounts. This produces not only NCO-functional monoadducts but also non-NCO-functional diadducts. Moreover, a certain fraction of monomeric diisocyanate remains unreacted. The proportions of the various products fluctuate, depending on the accessibility of the NCO group and the reaction regime employed, such as temperature and time. All of the adducts prepared in this way, however, include relatively large amounts of unreacted diisocyanate, leading, on further reaction of polyamines, to uncontrolled chain extension of the molecule. These products then show a propensity toward precipitation phenomena or premature gelling and, accordingly, to the formation of so-called "seeds" in the binder. US 6,420,466 gets round these disadvantages by removing the excess isocyanate. The products<br><br>
Byk Chemie GmbH<br>
S 05804	- 3 -<br>
described in that patent, however, have the disadvantage that they yield stable solutions only in solvents of high polarity, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), for example, with the assistance of alkali metal salts.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide products suitable for rheology control in liquid polymer systems, which comprise polymers having a more defined structure and so ensuring a better profile of action and improved reproducibility of the rheology control, and which, in particular, avoid the disadvantages, outlined above, of the prior-art additives.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that these objects are achieved by provision of amide-containing polymers of the general formula (I)<br>
