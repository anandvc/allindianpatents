				<td>DUAL CAPACITY COMPRESSOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compressors for compressing a working fluid,<br>
such as refrigerant, to a required pressure, and more particularly, to a compressor of ..<br>
which compression capacity changes with a direction of rotation.<br>
Background Art<br>
The dual capacity compressor is a kind of reciprocating type compressor of<br>
which piston stroke as well as a compression capacity vary with an eccentric sleeve<br>
rotatably coupled to a crank pin of a crankshaft, a position of which with respect to the <br>
crank pin is dependent on a direction of rotation of the motor and the crankshaft.<br>
Since the dual capacity compressor has a compression capacity that can be varied with<br>
a required load, the dual compressor is used widely in apparatuses which require<br>
compression of working fluid, particularly in home appliances operative in a<br>
refrigeration cycle, such as a refrigerator, for enhancing an operation efficiency. A US.<br>
Patent 4,236,874 discloses a general dual capacity compressor, referring to which a<br>
related art dual capacity compressor will be explained, briefly. FIG. 1 illustrates a<br>
section of a dual capacity compressor disclosed in USP 4,236,874, and FIG. 2<br>
illustrates operation of the dual capacity compressor, schematically.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the dual capacity compressor is provided with a piston 7 in<br>
a cylinder 8, a crankshaft 1, a crank pin 3 having a center 3 a eccentric from a center of.<br>
the crankshaft la, an eccentric ring 4 coupled on the crank pin 3, and a connecting rod<br>
6 connected to the eccentric ring 4 and the piston 7, as key components. The eccentric<br>
ring and the connecting rod 6 are rotatable both with respect Jo the other, and the center<br>
3a of the crank pin. There are release areas 9 in contact surfaces of the crank pin 3<br>
and the eccentric ring 4, and a key 5 for coupling the crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring<br>
4 together fitted in the release areas for coupling the crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring<br>
4. The operation of the dual capacity compressor with respect to the compression<br>
capacity will be explained.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, in the dual capacity compressor, a stroke of the piston 7 is<br>
regulated by an eccentricity varied with a position of the eccentric ring 4, and, if a large<br>
capacity is required, the crank shaft 1 is rotated in a clockwise direction (regular<br>
direction) and, if a small capacity is required, the crank shaft 1 is rotated in .a counter<br>
clockwise direction (reverse direction). In detail, FIG. 2A illustrates a moment the<br>
piston 7 is at a top dead center during a clockwise rotation, and FIG. 2A illustrates a <br>
moment the piston 7 is at a bottom dead center during a clockwise rotation, when the<br>
stroke Lmax is the greatest because the eccentricity is the greatest. And, FIG. 2C<br>
illustrates a moment the piston 7 is at a bottom dead center during a counter clockwise<br>
rotation, and FIG. 2D illustrates a moment the piston 7 is at a top dead center during a<br>
counter clockwise rotation, when the stroke Lmin is the smallest because the<br>
eccentricity is the smallest.<br>
However, during the foregoing operation, the crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring<br>
4 are involved in centrifugal forces, respectively caused by their rotation around the<br>
center la of the crank shaft, exerting on a point between the shaft center la and the pin<br>
center 3a, and a point on a line extended from the shaft center la to the a center of<br>
gravity of the ring 4a, respectively. Therefore, different from FIGS. 2A and 2B, as<br>
lines of actions are not one the same line, a local rotating moment is occurred at the<br>
eccentric ring 4 as a product of a vertical distance 'd' to the pin 3 and its own<br>
centrifugal force, acting in a direction the same with a direction (counter clockwise<br>
direction) of rotation of the crank shaft 1. Since the crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring <br>
4 are members that can make relative movement to each other, the rotating moment<br>
causes a relative rotation of the eccentric ring 4 in a direction of rotation of the crank<br>
shaft 1, releasing the key 5 from the crank pin 3 and the eccentric ring 4, and leaving<br>
the eccentric ring 4 and the key 5 to move together as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Moreover, as shown in FIG. 3, during operation, for an example, in the<br>
clockwise direction, a pressure 'P' (a pressure of re-expansion of the working fluid) in<br>
the cylinder after compression pushes the eccentric ring 4 to a direction of rotation of<br>
the crank shaft 1, to cause the eccentric ring 4 to make a relative rotation with respect<br>
to the crank pin 3 in a rotation direction of the crank shaft. At the end, such a relative<br>
rotation makes operation of the compressor unstable, and performance of the<br>
compressor poor.<br>
In fact, the relative rotation is occurred because the key 5 can not fix the crank<br>
pin 3 and the eccentric ring, perfectly. The key 5 rolls within the release area<br>
whenever the direction of rotation of the crank shaft is changed, to cause serious wear<br>
at respective contact surfaces, that shortens a lifetime of the compressor.<br>
In the meantime, other than the USP 4,236,874, there are many patent<br>
publications that disclose technologies of the dual capacity compressors, which will be<br>
explained, briefly.<br>
Similarly, USP 4,479,419 discloses a dual capacity compressor provided with a<br>
crank pin, eccentric cam and a key. The key is fixed to the eccentric cam, and moves<br>
along a track in a crank pin when a direction of rotation of the compressor is changed.<br>
However, since the key can not fix the crank pin and the eccentric cam perfectly, the<br>
USP 4,479,419 also has unstable operation caused by the relative rotation.<br>
USP 5,951,261 discloses a compressor having an eccentric part with a bore of a<br>
fixed inside diameter formed across the eccentric part, and an eccentric cam with<br>
another bore with a diameter the same with the eccentric part formed at one side thereof.<br>
A pin is provided to the bore in the eccentric part, and a compression spring is provided<br>
to the bore in the eccentric sleeve. Accordingly, when the bores are aligned during<br>
rotation, the pin moves to the bore in the cam by a centrifugal force, that couples the<br>
eccentric part and the eccentric cam, together. However, since the USP 5,951,261 is<br>
provided with only one bore in the eccentric cam, the USP 5,951,261 can couple the<br>
eccentric part and the eccentric cam together only when the compressor rotates in a<br>
particular direction. Moreover, an operation reliability can not be secured, since an<br>
exact movement of the pin from the eccentric part to the cam through respective bores<br>
is difficult.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a dual capacity compressor that<br>
substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related<br>
art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a dual capacity compressor which can<br>
maintain a fixed eccentricity and make a stable operation even if the compressor is rotated in any<br>
directions that have different compression capacity.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which<br>
follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the<br>
invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the<br>
structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended<br>
drawings.<br>
As explained, the inventor understands that the unstable operation of the dual capacity<br>
compressor is caused by a local centrifugal force of the eccentric sleeve, and an external load through<br>
the connecting rod and etc., during operation. Though such causes are not avoidable as far as an<br>
eccentric mechanism is used, the inventor should understand that, if the crank pin and the eccentric<br>
sleeve can be fixed positively during operation, such a problem can be solved. Taking an idea of a<br>
key member that has such a fixing structure, the key member and members related thereto are<br>
modified as follows so that the relative motion between the crank pin and the eccentric sleeve can be<br>
prevented.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, as embodied and broadly described, the dual capacity compressor has a<br>
power generating part having a reversible motor and a crank shaft inserted in the motor; a<br>
compression part having a cylinder, a piston in the cylinder, and a connecting rod connected to the<br>
piston; a crank pin in an upper part of the crank shaft eccentric to a center of the crank shaft; an<br>
eccentric sleeve configured to be rotatably installed between the crank pin and an end of the<br>
connecting rod; and, a key member for making the eccentric sleeve to be completely caught at the<br>
crank pin in both clockwise and counter clockwise rotation of the motor, wherein different<br>
compression capacities are provided by re-arranging the eccentric sleeve as a direction of rotation of<br>
the motor is changed, and by preventing relative movement of the crank pin and the eccentric sleeve<br>
during operation by means of the key member, regardless of the direction of rotation of the<br>
motor.<br>
Preferably, the key member is in contact with the eccentric sleeve at a plurality of<br>
points, and more preferably, at two points set up with reference to a center line in any<br>
direction during operation.<br>
Preferably, the key member includes a first projection for projection for a length from<br>
the crank pin even when the compressor is not in operation, and a second projection for <br>
projection for a length from the crank pin when the compressor is in operation, and for<br>
doing this, it is more preferable that a distance between ends of the first and second<br>
projections has a length greater than an outer diameter of the crank pin.<br>
The crank pin includes one pair of key member fitting parts formed opposite to<br>
each other oriented on a sloped extension line with reference to a horizontal plane.<br>
The key member fitting part may be a pass through hole formed in a wall of the<br>
crank pin or at least one slot extended from a position of the wall of the crank pin to a<br>
top thereof. It is preferable that the crank pin is extended higher than the eccentric<br>
sleeve.<br>
The eccentric sleeve includes a track part formed along a circumference thereof<br>
for facilitating rotation of the eccentric sleeve itself relative to the projection of the key<br>
member, and a limiting part formed relative to the track part for limiting rotation of the<br>
projection of the key member.<br>
The track part of the eccentric sleeve may be a pass through hole extended for<br>
a length along a circumferential direction at a depth from a top thereof, or a cut away .<br>
part extended along a circumferential direction at a depth from the top.<br>
It is preferable that the steps formed between the track part and the limiting<br>
part are parallel to an extension line connecting a center of rotation of the crank shaft<br>
and a center of the crank pin, and, more preferably, spaced as much as a half of a<br>
thickness of the key member. The steps may be sloped at an angle with respect to an<br>
extension line connecting the rotation center of the crank shaft and the center of the<br>
crank pin. The eccentric sleeve may further include oil supply holes formed opposite<br>
to each other at a height.<br>
The key member includes a first projection projected for a length from the<br>
crank pin and engaged with one step on the eccentric member, a stopper for limiting a<br>
length of projection of the first projection, and a second projection projected opposite<br>
to the first projection during rotation and engaged with the other step of the eccentric<br>
sleeve.<br>
Preferably, the first and second projections of the key member have the same thickness,<br>
and have sections of circular, rectangular, or hexagonal. Preferably, the first<br>
projection has a length of projection from an outer circumference of the crank pin<br>
greater than a half of a width of the step, and the second projection has such a length<br>
that an end thereof is not projected from the outer circumference of the crank pin when<br>
the compressor is not in operation.<br>
The first stopper may have a crank pin contact surface, in conformity with an inner<br>
circumferential surface of the crank pin, or be of a separable type.<br>
The separable type first stopper may be inserted in a circumferential groove in the key<br>
member and fixed by a fixing member.<br>
The key member may further include an elastic member for supporting the key member<br>
such that a part of the key member is kept projected out of the crank pin regardless of<br>
operation of the compressor, and for doing this, the stopper further includes a receiver<br>
for the elastic member.<br>
It is preferable that the key member may further include a second stopper for limiting a<br>
length of projection of the second projection out of the crank pin according to-a<br>
direction of action of the centrifugal force. The second stopper may be a hollow tube<br>
member movably fitted in a -longitudinal direction of the second projection, a<br>
longitudinal extension of the first stopper having a diameter greater than a diameter of<br>
the second projection, or a radial direction extension of the second projection having a<br>
thickness.<br>
Thus, the present invention can prevent a relative rotation between the crank pin and<br>
the eccentric sleeve, thereby enhancing a stable operation and efficiency of the<br>
compressor.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>
detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further<br>
explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In<br>
explaining embodiments of the present invention, same parts will be given the same<br>
names and reference symbols, and additional explanations of which will "be omitted.<br>
An overall structure of the dual capacity compressor of the present invention will be<br>
explained, with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the dual capacity compressor of the present invention includes a<br>
power generating part 20 in a lower portion of the compressor for generating and<br>
providing a required power, and a compression part 30 for compressing working fluid<br>
by using the provided power. Moreover, in addition to this, the dual capacity<br>
compressor includes a stroke varying part 40 connecting the power generating part 20<br>
to the compression part 30 for varying a compression capacity during operation. The<br>
power generating part 20 and the compression part 30 are enclosed by a shell 11 for .<br>
preventing refrigerant from leaking, and there are a plurality of supporting members<br>
(i.e., springs) fitted to an inside of the shell for supporting a frame 12, elastically.<br>
There are a refrigerant inlet 13 and a refrigerant outlet 15 fitted to, and in<br>
communication with an inside of the shell.<br>
The power generating part 20 under the frame 12 includes a motor with a stator 21 and<br>
rotator 22 for generating a rotating force by an external electrical power, and a crank<br>
shaft 23. The motor is rotatable in a clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation. The crank<br>
shaft 23 has a lower part inserted in the rotator 22 for transmission of a power, with an<br>
oil hole or groove for supplying lubrication oil accommodated in the lower part to<br>
respective driving parts.<br>
The compression part 30 is fitted on the frame 12 above the power generating part 20<br>
and includes a mechanical driving part for compression of the refrigerant and a suction<br>
and discharge valves for assisting the driving part. The driving part that actually<br>
forms a compression space together with a cylinder 32 has piston 31 for reciprocating<br>
in the cylinder 32, and a connecting rod 33 for transmission of reciprocating power to<br>
the piston 31. The valves receive and discharge refrigerant to/from the cylinder in<br>
combination with a cylinder head 34 and the head coyer 35.<br>
The stroke varying part 40 of the dual capacity compressor of the present invention will<br>
be explained, while explanation of the power generating part and the compression part,<br>
which are identical to the related art, are omitted.<br>
The stroke varying part 40 includes a crank pin on top of the crank shaft in eccentric<br>
from the crank shaft, an eccentric sleeve rotatably fitted between an outer surface of the<br>
crank pin and the connecting rod, and a key member for fixing the crank pin and the<br>
eccentric sleeve together. This structure facilitates rearrangement of the eccentric<br>
sleeve depending on a direction of rotation (clockwise or counter clockwise) of the<br>
motor, that changes eccentricity and displacement of the piston, to change a<br>
compression capacity.<br>
In the present invention, basically the key member has a length greater than a diameter<br>
of the crank pin movably fitted in the crank pin, so that at least a part of the key<br>
member is projected from the crank pin even if the compressor is stopped, and the other<br>
end thereof is projected from the crank pin during the compressor is in operation by a.<br>
centrifugal force. Therefore, the key member is in contact with the eccentric sleeve at<br>
a plurality of points, and more particularly, the key member is in contact with two<br>
points of the eccentric member set up with reference to a center line of any direction on<br>
the same time during operation, actually. Eventually, the key member makes the <br>
eccentric sleeve to be engaged with the rotating crank pin completely, thereby<br>
preventing the eccentric sleeve and the crank pin from making a relative movement to<br>
the other. The foregoing dual capacity compressor of the present invention will be<br>
explained in detail taking first and second embodiments of the present invention as<br>
examples.<br>
FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate side and plan views a dual capacity compressor in<br>
accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein<br>
components thereof are shown in assembled states with partial sections for easy<br>
explanation and clarity. FIGS. 6A ~ 11C illustrate the components individually,<br>
referring to which the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained.<br>
The dual capacity compressor in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes a crank pin 110 having a pair of opposite key member fitting<br>
parts 111 at slanted positions, an eccentric sleeve 120 for partial limitation of rotation<br>
of a projection of the key member, and a key member 130 for Fitting through the key<br>
member fitting parts 111 such that at least a part thereof is projected from the crank pin<br>
110. The dual capacity compressor includes other components identical to the<br>
components in FIG. 4. A weight 'W force component of the key member 130 caused<br>
by the sloped disposal regulates movement and position of the key member 130. That<br>
is, at least a part of the key member is projected from the crank pin 110 by the weight<br>
' W' when the compressor is not in operation. As shown in FIG. 5 A, the crank pin 110<br>
is hollow partially, and has an oil passage 112 and an oil supply hole 113, as well as the<br>
key member fitting parts 111. The fitting parts llla and 111b are formed in the<br>
hollow tube part so as to be disposed in a vertical plane containing the crank shaft<br>
center 23a and the crank pin center 110a. As described, the fitting parts llla and 111b<br>
are disposed on an extension of line sloped at an angle to a horizontal plane.<br>
Accordingly, the key member 130 in the fitting parts llla and 111b has influences of<br>
force components of the weight of the key member 130 itself and a centrifugal force F<br>
on the extension line between the centers 23 a and 110a exerted thereon. As shown in<br>
FIG. 6A, the fitting parts llla and 111b actually form a pass through hole in the first<br>
embodiment. This pass through hole can prevent the key member 130 from falling off<br>
during operatipn of the compressor. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 6B, at least one of<br>
the fitting parts llla and 111b may be a slot extended from a top end of a wall of the<br>
crank pin 110 to a position, for easy fitting of the key member 130 to the crank pin 110.<br>
It is more preferable that there is a seat part 111c at an end of the fitting part for stable<br>
fitting of the key member 130. The oil passage 112 is in communication both with the<br>
oil groove in outside surface of the crank shaft 23, and the oil supply hole 113. "The<br>
oil supply hole 113 is formed along a line perpendicular to an extension line connecting<br>
the fitting parts llla and 111b (i.e., an extension line between the centers 23a and 110a).<br>
The lubrication oil on the bottom of the compressor is at first passed through the oil<br>
groove and the oil passage 112, and sprayed so as to be supplied between contact<br>
surfaces of the components during operation for prevention of wear and smooth<br>
operation of the components, and may be supplied to a gap between the crank pin 110<br>
and the eccentric sleeve 120 directly through the oil supply hole 113. Preferably, the<br>
crank pin 110 is formed higher than the eccentric sleeve 120, for spraying the<br>
lubrication oil to the components evenly from the high position.<br>
The eccentric sleeve 120 in the first embodiment basically has an inner circumferential<br>
surface rotatably coupled to an outer circumferential surface of the crank pin, and an<br>
outer circumferential surface rotatably coupled to an end of the connecting rod 33. In<br>
detail, as shown in 7 A, the eccentric sleeve 120 includes a track part 121 formed along<br>
a circumference thereof, and a limiting part 122 for limiting a track of the .track part<br>
121. There are two steps 123a and 123b between the track part 121 and the limiting<br>
part 122. The track part 121 facilitates rotation of the eccentric sleeve 120 itself<br>
relative to the projected part when the key member 130 is stopped. Since at least a<br>
part of the key member 130 is projected when the compressor is not in operation, the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120 can rotate round the crank pin 110 as much as a range the track<br>
part 120 is formed therein when the compressor is not in operation. During stoppage<br>
and movement relative to the track part 121, the limiting part 122 limits rotation of the<br>
sleeve by the projection of the key member 130, as the projections of the key member<br>
130 are barred at the steps 123.<br>
The track part 121 may be a cut away part extended along a circumference starting<br>
from top end of the eccentric sleeve 120 to a required depth, actually. As shown in<br>
FIGS. 5B and 7B, the steps 123a and 123b are formed parallel to an extension line<br>
between the crank shaft center 23 a and the crank pin center 110a at first. That is, the <br>
steps 123 a and 123 b are actually formed in parallel to an extension line between a<br>
maximum thickness and a minimum thickness of the eccentric sleeve to have a<br>
different thickness, and the extension line are on the extension line between the centers<br>
23a and 110a. The steps 123a and 123b are positioned on an extension line parallel to<br>
the extension line of the centers 23a and 110a, on the same time. Consequently, the<br>
key member 130 disposed on the same extension line can be barred at the steps 123,<br>
such that the steps 123 form common contact surfaces for the key member 130, actually.<br>
Preferably, the steps 123a and 123b are away from the extension line between the<br>
centers 23a and 110a by a half'of a thickness 't' of" the key member 130. according to<br>
this, the key member 130 can make be barred more stably and accurately. On the<br>
other hand, the steps 123a and 123b may be formed to have sloped at an angle with<br>
respect to the extension line between the centers 23a and 110a. More particularly, the<br>
steps 123 c and 123d may be formed along a radial direction extension line of the crank<br>
pin center 110a sloped with respect to the extension line between the centers 23 a and<br>
110a. Also, the steps 123e and 123f may be formed sloped at an angle toward the<br>
limiting part centered on a cross point with an inner circumference. Even the above<br>
cases, the steps 123c, 123d, 123e and 123f have at least common contact points, to<br>
permit engagement.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7C, the eccentric sleeve 120 may further include oil supply holes 124<br>
formed oppositely at a height. The oil supply holes 124 may be through holes formed<br>
symmetry with respect to the extension line between the centers 23a and 110a, such<br>
that the oil supply hole 124 is in communication with the oil supply hole 113 in the<br>
crank pin when the key member 130 is barred by the eccentric sleeve 110. Therefore,<br>
during operation of the compressor, one of the two oil supply holes 125 is in<br>
communication with the oil supply hole 113 regardless of the direction of rotation,<br>
allowing the lubrication oil supplied to the eccentric sleeve 120 and the connecting rod<br>
33. In addition to this, an oil groove 124a is formed around the oil supply hole 124 to<br>
a depth, for forming a space for distributing the oil around the oil supply hole 124,.<br>
thereby making supply of lubrication oil between the eccentric sleeve 120 and the <br>
connecting rod 33 easy.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, basically the first embodiment key member 130 includes a first<br>
projection 131 to be projected for a length from the crank pin 110 even when the<br>
compressor is not in operation, and a second projection 132 to be projected for a length<br>
from the crank pin 110. The key member 130 includes a first stopper 133 for defining<br>
a projection length of the first projection part. The second projection 132 is disposed<br>
in the crank pin 110 to be far from the center 22a of the crank shaft for receiving a<br>
greater centrifugal force, leading the first projection 131 disposed near to the center 22a,<br>
relatively.<br>
In the first embodiment, as shown in FIG. 5A, the first projection 131 is projected by its<br>
own weight when the compressor is not in operation, so as to be engaged with one of<br>
the steps 123a and 123b, and is maintained to keep an engaged state with the steps<br>
when the compressor is in operation. A length of the projection is limited as the first<br>
 stopper 133 of the key member 130 interferes with an inner wall of the crank pin 110.<br>
For more stable operation, it is preferable that the length of the first projection is at <br>
least a half of a minimum width of the steps 123a and 123b.<br>
The second projection is projected in a direction opposite to the first projection, to<br>
engage with the other step during operation. According to this, the first and second<br>
projections 131 and 132 of the key member 130 are barred on the same time with the<br>
eccentric sleeve 120. Such movement and projection of the second projection is made<br>
in a direction of a centrifugal force (i.e., an extension line between the centers 23a and<br>
110a) as a component of the centrifugal force occurred along the key member 130<br>
becomes greater than a component of the weight during operation. In this instance,<br>
the eccentric sleeve 120 rotates round the crank pin 110 for changing eccentricity when<br>
the compressor changes a direction of rotation. In order not to interfere the rotation of<br>
the eccentric sleeve 120, the second projection is required to have a length not<br>
projected from an outer circumference of the. crank pin when the compressor is not in<br>
operation.<br>
The first and second projections 131 and 132 are engaged with the steps 123a and 123b<br>
alternately, particularly, the second projection 132 is engaged with the steps 123a and<br>
123b during operation. Since the key member 130 is disposed on the extension line<br>
between the centers 23a and 110a or at least parallel thereof, contact positions of the<br>
key member 130 to the steps 123a and 123b vary if thickness 'tl' and 't2' of the first<br>
and second projections differ. Therefore, the thickness ctl' and 't2' of the first and<br>
second projections 131 and 132 are required to have the same thickness for accurate<br>
engagement with the steps 123a and 123b. Though a section of the key member 130<br>
is circular in the drawing and description of the present invention, any form of a section,<br>
such as square or hexagonal, that can make engagement with the steps 123a and 123b,-<br>
may be used.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, a contact surface 133a of the first stopper 133 may have a form in<br>
conformity with an inner circumferential surface of the crank pin 100, so that the key<br>
member 130 is engaged with the crank pin 110 exactly, and makes more smooth<br>
operation owing to an increased weight thereof (i.e., an increased centrifugal force<br>
makes an easy projection of the second projection 132). The first stopper 133 may be<br>
formed as a unit with the key member 130, or separately to be fitted to the key member<br>
130. Examples of such separate type first stopper 133 are shown in FIGS. 10A and<br>
10B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10A, the first stopper 133 may include projections 133a extended<br>
inward in a radial direction for inserting in a circumferential groove in coupling with<br>
the key member 130. Or, as shown in FIG. 11 A, the ring formed first stopper 133<br>
may be fixed on the key member 130. This separation type stopper 133 permits to fit<br>
the key member 130 to the crank pin 130 even when both of the key member fitting<br>
parts Ilia and 111b are through holes, by placing the stopper 133 inside the crank pin<br>
110 and inserting the key member 130 through the through holes.<br>
In the meantime, as explained, the projection length of the second projection 132 in the<br>
key member 130 can be adjusted for some extent by a weight component of the key<br>
member 130 exerting opposite to the centrifugal force component. However, the<br>
sharp acceleration occurred on the crank shaft 23 and the crank pin 110 at starting of<br>
the compressor causes a substantial momentary centrifugal force exerted to the key<br>
member 130. This centrifugal force makes an excessive projection of the second<br>
projection 132 enough to cause the first projection 131 broken away from the fitting<br>
part 111. Therefore, it is preferable that the key member 130 further includes a second<br>
stopper 134 for limiting the projection length of the second projection 133 from the<br>
crank pin 110.<br>
Referring to FIG, 11 A, the second stopper 134 may be a hollow tube member 134a<br>
movably fitted in a length direction of the second projection 132. The second stopper<br>
134a comes to contact both with the first stopper 133 and an inside wall of the crank<br>
pin 110 when the key member 130 moves in a direction of the centrifugal force, thereby<br>
preventing the second projection 133 not to be projected more than a certain length.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11B, the second stopper 134 may be at least an extension 134b<br>
having a thickness greater than a thickness of the second projection 133. That is, the<br>
second stopper 134b in FIG. 1 IB is a lengthwise extension of the first stopper 133,<br>
actually. Or, as shown in-FIG. 11C, the second stopper 134 may be a radial direction<br>
extension 134c of the second projection to a required thickness, having a form-<br>
substantially identical to the first stopper 133. Similar to variations to the first stopper<br>
133 described in association with FIGS. 10A and 10B, the stoppers 134b and 134c may<br>
be separate members fixed to the key member 130, respectively.<br>
SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
 The second embodiment dual capacity compressor of the present invention has a key<br>
member fitting structure different from the first embodiment compressor on the whole.<br>
FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate side view and plan view of the dual capacity compressor<br>
in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention respectively, and<br>
FIGS. 13 ~ 15c illustrate major individual components thereof. Alike the first<br>
embodiment, the individual components are shown in an assembled state including<br>
partial sections for easy and clarity of description. The second embodiment will be <br>
explained with reference to the above drawings.<br>
The dual capacity compressor 200 in accordance with a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes a crank pin 210 having one pair of opposite and parallel key<br>
member fitting parts 211, an eccentric sleeve 220 for partial limitation of rotation of a<br>
key projection,-and a key member 230 fitted through the fitting parts 211 such that at<br>
least a part of the key member 230 is projected from the crank pin 210. In addition to<br>
this, the second embodiment compressor includes an elastic member 240 for regulating<br>
a position of the key member 230 when the compressor is in, or not in, operation. As<br>
shown, different from the first embodiment, since the key member in the second<br>
embodiment is fitted horizontally, a separate member, such as the elastic member 240,<br>
is required. Since components of the second embodiment are substantially identical to<br>
the first embodiment, the second embodiment will be explained with reference to<br>
distinctive features.<br>
The crank pin 210 includes an oil passage 212 and an oil supply hole 213 in a lower<br>
part thereof, as well as the key member fitting parts 211a and 211b. As shown in FIG.<br>
12B, the fitting parts 211a and 211b are positioned on an extension line between the<br>
centers 23 a and 210a, or at least parallel thereto on the same horizontal plane as shown<br>
in FIG. 12A. Consequently, the key member 230 in the fitting parts 211 is influenced<br>
from the centrifugal force exerted on the extension line between the centers 23 a and<br>
210a in a length direction of the key member 230. The fitting parts 211a and 211b<br>
may actually be through holes, or may includes at least one slot extended from a top<br>
end of a wall of the crank pin 210 to a required position.<br>
Identical to the first embodiment, the eccentric sleeve 220 includes a track part 221, a<br>
limiting part 222, and two steps 223 between the track part 221 and the limiting part<br>
222. The track part 221 may be, not only the cut away part in FIG. 7A, but also a pass<br>
through hole extended along a circumferential direction for a length at a depth from the<br>
top end as shown in FIG. 13. Such a form of track part 221 is made available as the<br>
key member 230 is fitted in a horizontal direction, for prevention of the key member<br>
230 from vertical falling off by barring the projection when the key member 230 is<br>
stopped. The steps 223a and 223b may be formed parallel to an extension line<br>
between the centers 23a and 210a, or sloped an angle. The key member 230 includes<br>
a first projection 131, a second projection 132, and a first stopper 223. The first<br>
projection 231 is projected from the crank pin 210 regardless of operation of the<br>
compressor (stop or operation) by an elastic force of the elastic member, and engaged<br>
with one of the steps 223a or 223b. For this, the elastic member 240 is fitted on the<br>
second projection to support the first stopper 233 together with the inside wall of the<br>
crank pin 210. When the centrifugal force generated along the key member 230<br>
becomes greater than the elastic force during operation, the second projection 130<br>
moves and projected in a direction of the centrifugal force (i.e., a direction of the<br>
extension line between the centers 23a and 210a).<br>
In the meantime, as shown in FIG. 14, the first stopper 233 has a contact surface 233a<br>
in conformity with an inside surface of the crank pin 210, and preferably a receiver<br>
233b for the elastic member 240. The contact surface 133a and the receiver 233b<br>
assist stable operation of the key member 230, actually. The first stopper 233 may or<br>
may not be formed as a unit with the key member 130.<br>
A projection length of the second projection can be regulated by the elastic force of the<br>
elastic member 240 during regular operation. However, for preventing the second<br>
projection member from being broken off by the momentary centrifugal force described <br>
before, the key member 230 further includes the second stopper 234.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 15A ~ 15C, the second stopper 234 is formed identical to the first<br>
embodiment. That is, the second stopper 234 in the second embodiment may be, a<br>
hollow tube member 234a on the second projection 232 fitted movably in a longitudinal<br>
direction, a longitudinal extension 234b of the first stopper 133, or a radial direction<br>
extension 234c of the second projection having a thickness. The elastic member 240<br>
makes a relative position different from the first embodiment. In detail, in a case of<br>
the hollow tube 234a, the elastic member 240 is disposed between the second stopper<br>
234a and the second projection 232. In a case of the longitudinal extension 234b, the<br>
elastic member 240 is fitted to an outer circumference of the second stopper 234b, and<br>
in a case of radial direction extension 234c, the elastic member is fitted between the<br>
second stopper 234b and an inner surface of the crank pin 210.<br>
The operation of the first or second embodiment compressor of the present invention<br>
will be explained with reference to related drawings. Because the first and second<br>
embodiments differ in the key member 130 or 230 movement regulating methods, such<br>
as by the key member weight from the sloped orientation thereof, or by the elastic force,<br>
but are almost identical in actual operation, the operation will be explained based on the<br>
second embodiment for avoiding duplication of explanation. FIGS. 16A and 16B<br>
illustrate plan views showing operation of key parts of a dual capacity compressor in<br>
regular direction rotation in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, and FIGS. 17A and 17B illustrate plan views showing operation of<br>
key parts of a dual capacity compressor in reverse direction rotation in accordance with<br>
a second preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 16A illustrates a relative position between the key member 230 and the eccentric<br>
sleeve 220 when the crank shaft 23 starts to rotate in a clockwise direction, and the first<br>
projection 231 is projected from the crank pin 210 by the elastic force, and engaged<br>
with the step 223b on a thin side of the eccentric sleeve 220. On the same time with<br>
this, components 210, 220, and 230 except the connecting rod 33 connected to the<br>
piston starts to rotate in a clockwise direction. When an angular speed of the rotation<br>
reaches to a preset level, as shown in FIG. 16B, the key member 230 moves along-the<br>
extension line between the centers 23 a and 210a by the centrifugal force F. According<br>
to this, the second projection 232 is engaged with the step 223a on a thick side of the<br>
eccentric sleeve 220, while the first projection 231 is also kept the contact with the step<br>
223b on the same time. Such a simultaneous multiple point contact makes a complete<br>
engagement between the key member 230 and the eccentric sleeve 220. Therefore,<br>
even if any external force P from re-expansion of the working fluid after the<br>
compression or other force is transmitted through the connecting rod 33 in a regular<br>
direction rotation, there will be no relative rotation occurred between.the crank pin 210<br>
and the eccentric sleeve 220. Even if the local rotating moment is occurred at the<br>
eccentric sleeve 220, the relative rotation to the crank pin 110 can be prevented.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7B, a part of the drawing in solid lines illustrates a top dead center<br>
state, and a part of the drawing in dashed lines illustrates a bottom dead, center state,<br>
wherein the eccentric sleeve 220 is oriented such that a maximum eccentricity is<br>
occurred in the regular direction rotation, when the piston has the maximum stroke<br>
Lmax, to provide the maximum compression capacity.<br>
In the meantime, when the crank shaft 23 and the crank pin 210 unitary therewith start<br>
to rotate in a reverse direction, i.e., in a counter clockwise direction, the eccentric<br>
sleeve 220 is rotated in a regular direction between, and relative to the crank pin 210<br>
and the connecting rod 33. According to this, as shown in FIG. 17A, the step 223a on<br>
the thick side of the eccentric sleeve 220 is engaged with the first projection 231. As<br>
shown in FIG. I7B, identical to the case of regular direction rotation, when an angular<br>
rotation speed reaches to a preset level, the second projection 232 is engaged with the<br>
step 223b on the thin side of the eccentric sleeve 220 by the centrifugal force F, making<br>
the multiple contact state between, the eccentric sleeve 220 and the key member 230. <br>
Therefore, even if any external force P applied to the piston by the working fluid during<br>
the compression or other force is transmitted in the reverse direction rotation, there will<br>
be no relative rotation occurred between the crank pin 210 and the eccentric sleeve 220.<br>
In the meantime, as shown in FIG. 7B, the eccentric sleeve 220 is disposed to have a<br>
minimum eccentricity in the case of the reverse direction rotation, it is understandable<br>
that the compressor has a minimum compression capacity.<br>
Eventually, as the compressor of the present invention excludes relative rotation<br>
between the crank pin and the eccentric sleeve, elements maintaining the eccentricity,<br>
completely, the compressor of the present invention can make a stable operation in any<br>
operative states, i.e., in the regular or reverse direction rotation.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations<br>
can be made in the dual capacity compressor of the present invention without departing<br>
from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come<br>
within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The multiple point contact between the eccentric sleeve and the key member<br>
during operation leads the crank pin having the key member positioned therein caught<br>
with the eccentric sleeve completely. Therefore, there will be no relative movement-<br>
between the eccentric sleeve and the crank pin even if any external or internal cause is<br>
occurred, that allows a stable operation without any output variation of the compressor.<br>
In more detail, as the eccentricity is fixed, a designed compression capacity can be<br>
obtained without change. And, a friction loss between the crank pin and the eccentric<br>
sleeve caused by the relative movement can be prevented. At the end, such a stable<br>
operation brings about an increased efficiency of the dual capacity compressor. In<br>
addition to this, noise occurred from the relative movement can be prevented, and<br>
components lifetime can be prolonged. And, since a structure of the present invention<br>
is simple and fabrication thereof is easy, a productivity can be increased.<br>
