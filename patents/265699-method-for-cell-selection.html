[0003] A problem can arise when a 3G network operator, who does not control a 2G network, has established a national roaming agreement to provide service for network subscribers outside the coverage of the network operator's 3G coverage. The roaming partner may also provide 3G service. The 3G service, though, may not be available for national roaming. Similarly a dual mode network operator may allow international roaming only on the 2G network. Another similar case can occur when only specific home network customers have access to the 3G network. Roaming subscribers (generally those who do not have permission to use 3G service) should not use the 3G service when there are 3G cells within a location area. On the other hand, as 3G neighbor cells are broadcast on the 2G network, the roaming subscriber will also receive this information and use it as defined. This means that roaming subscribers may possibly reselect to the 3G cells. The network operator may assure that the roaming subscriber does not obtain 3G service by concentrating the 3G cells in location area(s) which are different from the 2G location area(s), and then by rejecting a location update request into a 3G location area for those subscribers who are not permitted to use 3G cells (with an appropriate cause value). The subscriber is then forced to leave the 3G cell, but stay in the same network when the reject cause is, for example, one specified as #15 ("no suitable cells in this location area"). [0004] A similar (non-roaming) scenario may also occur in the user's 2G- and 3G-capable home network when the user, by subscription, is allowed to operate only in the 2G portion of the home network and not in 3G portion of the home network [0005] In general, this means that if an attempted LR procedure ends in rejection by the network, then the behavior of the UE is governed by the cause value that the network included in the message indicating rejection of the request. In some cases the reject cause values are meaningful across all cells in the same Location Area (LA). As an example, cause value #15 ("no suitable cells in this location area") denies access for the UE to all cells in the same LA. The location area reject forces the UE to add the location area to the list of forbidden location areas that are not accessible by the UE for a certain amount of time (such as 12 hours).<br><br>
[0006] A future cell re-selection procedure will then exclude all cells of the serving Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) that indicate the same LA, so in practice the UE is commanded by the network to search a cell of another LA in the same PLMN. [0007] One problem with the current approach is that when the UE has re-selected back to a GSM cell, the only knowledge it has concerning WCDMA neighbor cells, based on the system information messages, is the radio frequency and scrambling code. In addition, the 2G to 3G reselection follows a principle that the suitability criteria of the target cell need not be checked before the reselection attempt is initiated, hi some cases this is not possible without compromising the operation at the serving cell.<br>
[0008] This means that the UE may, after a short time, try reselection to the same or another 3G cell. The outcome from this reselection would be a failure, as the location area is listed on the list of forbidden location areas. This though is not known unless the UE reselects to the cell or reads the 3G cell location area information (e.g. prior to the cell change). This approach is time consuming, increases power consumption and, in a worst case, the user may experience an inferior connection, as a service interrupt is generated when an unsuccessful (unnecessary) reselection attempt is performed during GPRS packet transfer mode (when NCO or NCI mode is applied for cell reselection). In this case, data transfer may be significantly degraded (depending on the frequency of "unnecessary" reselection attempts), a page can be lost, or the entire connection can be lost.<br>
[0009] On the 2G side, the UE when camped on a CCCH is expected to read SI3/4 before reselection is possible. The information received in this SI (which may also be referred to as System Information) message contains information about the neighbor cell's location area. Thereby the UE can evaluate, before the cell change, whether the cell is listed on a list of forbidden location areas. If this is the case, the UE can prevent a cell change towards that cell.<br>
[0010] In the situation of 2G-3G inter-working the same approach is not possible in most cases. The only currently specified solution for the UE is to attempt to perform cell re-selection as described above. This trial and error mechanism is not very efficient. The failure may continuously repeat even if the UE attempts multiple cell re-selections towards the same 3G cell.<br><br>
[0011] In case of reselection towards a 3G cell, the UE needs to read the system information of the 3G cell in order to obtain the location area information of that cell. However in order to do this while there is an ongoing GPRS data transfer connection, the MS needs to interrupt the data transfer, which may cause the data throughput to be reduced.<br>
[0012] It can be noted that a similar situation exists also on the 2G side when the UE or mobile station (MS) is camped on the PCCCH. In this case the UE receives the neighbor cell(s) parameters regarding cell reselection from the current serving cell's broadcast PSI3-series on the PBCCH. This means that the MS does not need to read the neighbor cell's SI3/4 information in order to obtain the parameters affecting cell reselection, so the MS will not know the LAI of the neighbor cell, thereby introducing the same situation as in 2G-3G inter-working cell reselection.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] Exemplary embodiments of the invention relate generally to cellular mobility, but are applicable as well to non-cellular technologies. The exemplary embodiments of this invention improve mobility in the situation where a mobile device, also referred to as user equipment (UE), may perform reselection/cell change towards location areas in which it has no access. The invention is described using second and third generation (2G, 3G) inter-working as non-limiting examples, and is particularly advantageous for use in a UTRAN.<br>
[0026] When the UE is camped on a cell of the registered Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), it may perform cell re-selections to ensure that it is camped on the best cell according to network settings that are available in the serving PLMN. [0027] If after cell re-selection a new cell is found to be part of different LA, based on the LAI, then the' UE determines whether to perform a LR procedure to inform the network that it has moved to a new LA.<br>
[0028] In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of this invention the UE is enabled to link the location area information with the neighbour cell information based on the neighbour list and broadcast information, thereby directly determining<br>
whether a certain cell belongs to a location area listed in the list of forbidden location areas.<br>
[0029] A plurality of embodiments are provided for overcoming the problems discussed above, including: a plurality of network-assisted embodiments and at least one UE-only embodiment. The UE-only embodiment provides immediate improved operation as compared to current practice. The network-assisted embodiments provide a long-term flexible and efficient solution for overcoming the problems discussed above.<br>
[0030] These embodiments of this invention can be realised by adding to broadcast system information certain information that links location areas to cells of the neighbour cell list. This can be accomplished either on the 2G side or the 3G side, as discussed in further detail below.<br>
[0031] Several network-based exemplary embodiments of the invention are as follow. In an exemplary embodiment, additional information is added to the RAN system information broadcast message to provide the UE sufficient guidance to avoid the cells that belong to location areas that have already been forbidden for the UE. In this case, explicit LA and/or PLMN information is added for each cell on the 3G neighbour cell list received in the 2G RAN system information broadcast messages. Alternatively this information may be added in the 3G RAN system information    . broadcast messages, allowing the UE to make use of this additional information when coming back to the 2G cell and continuing operation there (note, in accordance with conventional practice the PLMN information is already provided on the 3G cell, the LA information is not).<br>
[0032] Instead of broadcasting the full LA information in the RAN system information broadcast messages, in this embodiment the information is simplified to indicate whether a group of 3G cells belong to the same LA, such that if the UE is able to determine the actual LA of one cell in the group, it can then infer that the LA of the other 3G cells in the same group is the same.<br>
[0033] In accordance with this further non-limiting embodiment, in the location update reject message the core network also sends a list of forbidden LAs to inform the UE. With this information, and the UE discovering the neighbour 3G cell's LA information (e.g., through the use of one of the above solutions or using existing<br><br>
procedures), the UE need not attempt location updates every time it enters a location area that is not yet listed in its list of "forbidden location areas for roaming". [0034] In accordance with a UE-only exemplary embodiment of the invention, the UE stores the information it receives from its environment, and in this manner is able to avoid subsequent cell re-selections to the same cell or group of cells that have already been found to be part of a forbidden LA.<br>
[0035] The UE-only embodiment can be implemented by, when the UE receives the Location Update Reject (LU Reject) with Reject Cause #15, in addition to listing the LAI in the list of "forbidden LAs for roaming" (also referred to herein as the forbidden LAI list) that is currently mandated by 3GPP TS 24.008, the UE inhibits subsequent reselection to all 3G cells belonging to the same frequency as the cell on which the UE received the LU Reject. This can be accomplished by storing a certain amount of cell information, the minimum being the cell's frequency and its LAI. The effect is to create a RAN-level "black list" of cells or frequencies that is used in conjunction with the forbidden LAI list such that the UE no longer attempts cell reselection towards any cell on that frequency as long as the LAI is forbidden.<br>
[0036] In an exemplary and non-limiting embodiment, if the highest ranked cell is an intra-frequency or inter-frequency cell (such as defined in 3GPP TS 25.331) which is not suitable due to being part of the "list of forbidden LAs for roaming" or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell and other cells on the same frequency, as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300s. If the highest ranked cell is an inter-RAT cell which is not suitable due to being part of the "list of forbidden LAs for roaming: or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell as a candidate for reselection for a maximum of 3.00s. As used herein, "registered PLMN" refers to the PLMN to which the UE is registered. Other PLMNs can be recognized by the UE as equivalent to the registered PLMN such as, for example, in accordance with a joint roaming agreement among PLMNs.<br>
[0037] With reference to Fig. 1, there is illustrated a non-limiting and exemplary embodiment of a method for implementing the UE-only solution. Note that in the logic flow diagram of Fig. 1, as well as the logic flow diagram of Fig 2, the UE is<br>
referred to as a mobile station (MS). As illustrated, at step 1 A, the UE camps on a cell of a particular RAT. At step IB, the UE performs measurements based on a list of neighbour cells/frequencies received from the current RAT RAN network. It is noted that neighbour cells may belong to the same or a different RAT and these measurements may be made from broadcast messages from the neighbour cells. At step 1C, the UE finds a cell or a list of cells fulfilling certain radio-based criteria such as, for example, those defined in 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 25.304. At step ID, the UE chooses a cell for reselection. The chosen cell may belong to the same or a different RAT of the current cell.<br>
[0038] After choosing a cell for reselection, at step IE a determination is made whether or not the chosen cell is listed in the RAN-level black list of cells/frequencies, the formation of which is described more fully below. If the chosen cell is not so listed, a determination is made at step IF as to the suitability of the chosen cell. If the chosen cell is deemed suitable, processing continues to step II. If the chosen cell is not deemed to be suitable, processing continues to step 1G. Likewise, if the chosen cell was determined to have been listed in the RAN-level black list of cells/frequencies at step IE, processing continues to step 1G. Note that the use of "chosen cell" does not imply that the UE attempts to establish contact. Rather, the UE chooses the cell and evaluates the suitability of the cell prior to attempting to establish itself on the cell. As is evident by its use herein, the term "chosen cell" does not imply that the UE attempts to select or re-select the cell. Rather, the UE chooses the cell and evaluates the suitability of the cell prior to attempting to camp on the cell.<br>
[0039] At step 1G, a determination is made if there is another cell in the candidate list to choose from. If there is another available candidate, processing continues at step ID. If there is another available candidate, processing continues at step 1H whereat the UE remains camped on the current cell and processing continues to step IB. [0040] At step II, the UE camps on the chosen cell and receives from the RAN a list of neighbor cells/frequencies. At step 1J, the UE initiates a location update procedure with the core network. At step IK, the network rejects the presence of the UE in the LA/PLMN. At step 1L, the UE stores the LA identity (LAI) of the current cell on a forbidden LAI list in accordance, for example, with 3GPP TS 24.008 and starts a<br>
timer. At step 1M the UE maintains a RAN-level black list storing the cell information obtained by cell measurements. This cell information can include a) only the frequency of the current cell, b) the frequency and code of the current cell, c) the frequencies/cells in the RAM-provided neighbor list, and d) the RAT of the current cell. This information is associated with the LAI of the cell from which it is obtained. At step IN the UE searches for a suitable cell to camp on and proceeds to step 1 A. The suitable cell could be a cell belonging to a different RAT than the one the UE is currently on and have a different PLMN and/or a different LA. [0041] The blocking time of the cells/frequencies can be defined in several ways. The following list provides examples of blocking time options:<br>
1)	Forever.<br>
2)	Until next successful cell reselection.<br>
3)	Until a new neighbour cell list has been received from RAN.<br>
4)	According to current definition of the lifetime of the forbidden LAI list. This means<br>
that all cells on the frequency are barred for as long as the LAI is listed on the<br>
forbidden LAI list. Rules on how this list is handled (including when to clear it) are<br>
currently specified in 3G TS 24.008.<br>
5)	Until the next successful Location Update in LA with same LAI as listed in the<br>
forbidden LAI list.<br>
6)	Until the next successful Location Update in any LAI in any RAN system.<br>
7)	Until the next successful Location Update in the RAN system equal to the RAN<br>
system of the/a LAI in the forbidden LAI list,<br>
[0042] When the blocking time is exceeded, the list of neighbour cells/frequencies is deleted.<br>
[0043] With reference to Fig. 2, there is illustrated a method for the UE to clear the RAN-level black list according to an exemplary and non-limiting embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, at step 2A, the UE is camped on a cell. If any of the three triggers (a,b,c), corresponding to a timeout of the clear forbidden LAI list parameter, the removal of the subscriber identity module (SIM), or a power off situation, processing proceeds to step 2B where the information on the forbidden LAI list is<br>
cleared. Processing then continues to step 2C where the RAN-level black list is cleared.<br>
[0044] If, in accordance with option 1 (optl), there is encountered a first cell reselection after the failure of a location registration<br>
(FIRST_CELL_RESEL_AFT_FAILED_LR) condition, processing likewise proceeds to step 2C. If, in accordance with option 2 (opt2), the UE receives a new neighbour list after a failed registration attempt<br>
(NEW_NLIST_RECEIVED_AFT_FAILED_LR), processing likewise proceeds to step 2C. If, in accordance with option 3a (opt3a), there is encountered a first successful location registration (FIRST_SUCCESSFUL_LR) condition, processing likewise proceeds to step 2C.<br>
[0045] In accordance with option 3b (opt3b), there is encountered a FIRST_SUCCESSFUL_LR condition, processing likewise proceeds to step 2D. At step 2D, if the LAI of the current cell is the same as a LAI listed in the forbidden LAI list, processing continues to step 2F and the RAN-level black list is cleared. Alternatively, if the LAI of the current cell is not the same as a LAI listed in the forbidden LAI list, processing continues to step 2G and nothing further is done to the RAN-level black list.<br>
[0046] In accordance with option 3c (opt3c), there is encountered a FIRST_SUCCESSFUL_LR condition, processing likewise proceeds to step 2E. At step 2E, if the current cell's LAI and RAT are the same as a LAI listed in the forbidden LAI list, processing continues to step 2F and the RAN-level black list is cleared. Alternatively, if the current cell's LAI and RAT are not the same as a LAI listed in the forbidden LAI list, processing continues to step 2G and nothing further is done to the RAN-level black list.<br>
[0047] The usage of the RAN-level black list can be applied in various ways. One technique bars all 3G cells belonging to the 3G neighbour cell list, when the UE receives a LU Reject with reject cause #15. The same technique, applied in a less aggressive manner, has the UE only bar the cell on which the LU reject with reject cause #15 was received.<br>
[0048] The blocking according to the foregoing description is preferably applied primarily for UE-based autonomous cell reselection, and would not, for example, prevent handover to the barred frequency.<br>
[0049] In the exemplary embodiments of UE-based optimization described above, the UE stores or memorizes the information it receives from its environment, and thus is enabled to avoid subsequent cell re-selections to the same cell or group of cells that have been discovered to be part of a forbidden LA or PLMN (or which may be assumed to be part of the same LA). The UE may memorize the frequency and/or other properties, such as the scrambling code, that can be used to again identify the cell that has previously rejected a LR attempt.<br>
[0050] The following example shows how the network-assisted solution for LA Grouping according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention can be implemented using only simplified LA information on the 3G RAN system information broadcast message. This exemplary embodiment can also be used with some modifications to the message fields if it is determined to be more beneficial to include the full LA information.<br>
[0051] The System Information Block type 18 contains PLMN identities of neighboring cells to be considered in idle mode as well as in the connected mode. The information elements (IBs) shown in bold and underlined are added in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
(Table Removed) [0052] This IE shown above contains the LA groupings of neighbour cells, and may be formulated as follows:(Table Removed)<br>
[0053] With regard to the foregoing two Tables, it is noted that the field "maxCellMeas" is defined in 3GPP TS 25.331, and that each "LA group" field denotes a LA that is different from the serving cell's, under which a list of cell IDs is given. In the above coding, the "LA group" field is simply a number confined by the range stipulated. It could also be replaced by the actual Local Area Identity (LAI) information. If the actual LAI information is needed, the UE need only obtain the LAI information from one of the cells listed under the same "LA group" field. [0054] For the embodiment where the needed information is to be broadcast on the 2G RAN system information broadcast message, the implementation may broadcast the LA and possibly the PLMN information of each 3G neighbour cell in a newly defined system information message type, or alternatively new fields may be added to an existing message type, such as System Information Type 2quater. [0055] The following non-limiting example shows how the system information coding may be implemented when adding new fields to an existing system information message type. As before, the information elements (IBs) shown in bold and underlined are added in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention:<br>

[0056] Here the LAI_ID_3G field could indicate both the full LAI of the neighbours<br>
belonging to the LAI, or it could indicate a simplified LAI.<br>
[0057] The field 'Number_of_3G_Neighbour_Cells' is used to indicate how many<br>
neighbours belong to the LAI identified by LAI_ID_3G, and is also used for<br>
indicating the length of '3G_Neighbour_Cell_Index' or '3G_Neighbour_Cell_bitmap'<br>
fields.<br>
[0058] This exemplary embodiment may be used when implementing two of the<br>
network-assisted embodiments: "LA broadcast solution" and "LA grouping solution".<br>
[0059] It is preferred that consideration be made of the criteria for removing a cell<br>
from the list of non-suitable cells, such as in border areas where the other PLMNs in<br>
the neighbouring regions may use the same radio frequency.<br>
[0060] The network based exemplary embodiments are designed to avoid causing<br>
problems for legacy UEs that still need to understand the current system information.<br>
Rather than using a completely new neighbour list encoding, it may be preferred to<br>
broadcast a separate list of the LAs of different cells on the neighbour list. This may<br>
be optimally done by sending the neighbour list as it is currently encoded, and then an<br>
addition to the list using the same indexes to identify the LA of each cell or group of<br>
cells in the neighbour list. This additional information can be included in the same<br>
System Information message, if there is enough capacity in the message. If not, then a<br>
new message may be introduced.<br>
[0061] The UE based RAN-level black list can be implemented by the UE without<br>
system standards, with consideration being made to the black list deletion criteria in<br>
order to not lose any possibly valid candidate(s) 3G cell for re-selection.<br>
[0062] Fig. 3 is a block diagram of apparatus suitable for implementing exemplary<br>
embodiments of the invention. A wireless communication system 10 includes a RAN<br>
embodied in at least one network element 12 that is coupled to a transceiver 14, such as a base station 16, for bidirectional communication with a UE 20 having a transceiver 22. The network element 12 is assumed to include or be coupled to a data processor 12A that in turn includes or is coupled to a memory 12B. The memory 12B stores data and operating programs, including one or more programs 13 the execution of which implements the network-assisted embodiments of this invention. The UE 20 is also assumed to include or be coupled to a data processor 20A that in turn includes or is coupled to a memory 20B. The memory 20B stores data and operating programs, including one or more programs 21 the execution of which implements the UE-based embodiment(s) of this invention. Note in this case the memory 20B may also store the RAN-level black list 20C, as discussed above. In the network-assisted embodiments the memory 20B may also store the list of forbidden location areas for roaming. The program 21 enables the UE 20 to implement the logic flow diagrams of Figs. 1 and 2 for the UE-based embodiment, and/or to respond to the network-originated messages discussed above if operating in accordance with the network-assisted embodiments. Note that the LA and their access restrictions can be governed by the CN of the wireless system, and the SI(B) and their distribution can be governed by the RAN. Note further in this regard that CN-related SI may be received by the RAN from the CN entity of the network, and mapped to a broadcast channel by the RAN. While illustrated in the exemplary embodiment above as distinct elements, in alternative exemplary and non-limiting embodiments of the invention the functionality of the network element 12 and base station 16 can be combined into a single element. [0063] In general, the various embodiments of the UE 20 can include, but are not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) having wireless communication capabilities, portable computers having wireless communication capabilities, image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities, gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities, music storage and playback appliances having wireless communication capabilities, Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing, as well as portable units or terminals that incorporate combinations of such functions. [0064] As was noted, certain of the embodiments of this invention may be implemented by computer software executable by the data processor 12A of the<br>
network element 12, and/or by the data processor 20A of the UE 20, and/or by dedicated hardware, or by a combination of software and hardware. Further in this regard it should be noted that the various blocks of the logic flow diagrams of Figs. 1 and 2 may represent program steps, or interconnected logic circuits, blocks and functions, or a combination of program steps and logic circuits, blocks and functions. [0065] The memories 12B and 20B may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology, such as semiconductor-based memory devices, magnetic memory devices and systems, optical memory devices and systems, fixed memory and removable memory. The data processors 12A and 20A may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment, and may include one or more of general purpose computers, special purpose computers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs) and processors based on a multi-core processor architecture, as non-limiting examples. [0066] In general, the various embodiments may be implemented in hardware or special purpose circuits, software, logic or any combination thereof. For example, some aspects may be implemented in hardware, while other aspects may be implemented in firmware or software which may be executed by a controller, microprocessor or other computing device, although the invention is not limited thereto. While various aspects of the invention may be illustrated and described as block diagrams, flow charts, or using some other pictorial representation, it is well understood that these blocks, apparatus, systems, techniques or methods described herein may be implemented in, as non-limiting examples, hardware, software, firmware, special purpose circuits or logic, general purpose hardware or controller or other computing devices, or some combination thereof.<br>
[0067] Embodiments of the inventions may be practiced in various components such as integrated circuit modules. The design of integrated circuits is by and large a highly automated process. Complex and powerful software tools are available for converting a logic level design into a semiconductor circuit design ready to be etched and formed on a semiconductor substrate.<br>
[0068] Programs, such as those provided by Synopsys, Inc. of Mountain View, California and Cadence Design, of San Jose, California automatically route conductors and locate components on a semiconductor chip using well established<br>
rules of design as well as libraries of pre-stored design modules. Once the design for a semiconductor circuit has been completed, the resultant design, in a standardized electronic format (e.g., Opus, GDSII, or the like) may be transmitted to a semiconductor fabrication facility or "fab" for fabrication. [0069] Based on the foregoing discussion it can be appreciated that in one non-limiting aspect thereof the invention provides apparatus, method and a computer program product for enabling a wireless network to transmit location area-related information to the UE 20 so that the UE 20 can associate the location area-related information with neighbour cell information for determining whether a certain cell belongs to a forbidden location area. With reference to Fig. 4, there is illustrated a flow chart of a method according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. At step 4A, the UE 20 receives location area-related information. At step 4B, the UE 20 associates the received location area-related information with neighbour cell information and determines whether a certain cell belongs to a forbidden location area. The wireless network may use broadcast system information to transmit information that links location areas to cells of a neighbour cell list by, in one non-limiting embodiment, adding additional information to RAN system information broadcast messages, such as explicit LA and/or PLMN information, for each cell in a 3G neighbour cell list received in a 2G RAN system information broadcast message, or by including the information in a 3G RAN system information broadcast message, thereby allowing the UE 20 to make use of this additional information when coming back to the 2G cell and continuing operation there.<br>
[0070] With reference to Fig. 5, there is illustrated a method according to an alternative exemplary embodiment of the invention. At Step 5 A, the wireless network may indicate whether a group of 3G cells belong to the same LA. Then, at step 5B, if the UE 20 is able to determine the actual LA of one cell in the group, it may then, at step 5C, infer or determine that the LA of other 3G cells in the same group is the same. Alternatively, the wireless network may use a location update reject message to send the UE 20 a list of forbidden LAs, such that the UE 20 need not attempt location updates when it enters a location area that is not yet listed in a UE 20 list of forbidden location areas for roaming.<br>
[0071] Based on the foregoing discussion it can be further appreciated that in another non-limiting aspect thereof the invention provides apparatus, method and a computer program product for enabling a UE 20 to store information that it receives from its environment to avoid subsequent cell re-selections to a same cell or group of cells that have been determined to be part of a forbidden LA. With reference to Fig. 6, there is illustrated a method according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. At step 6A, the UE 20 store information that it receives from its environment. At step 6B, the UE 20 uses the stored information to avoid subsequent cell re-selections to a same cell or group of cells that have been determined to be part of a forbidden LA. In this exemplary embodiment the UE 20 receives a Location Update Reject (LU Reject), with Reject Cause #15, and in addition to listing the LAI in a list of "forbidden LAs for roaming", further inhibits subsequent reselection to all 3G cells belonging to the same frequency as the cell on which the UE 20 received the LU Reject, thereby creating a RAN-level black list of cells or frequencies for use in conjunction,with the forbidden LAI list to avoid cell reselection towards any cell on that frequency so long as the LAI is forbidden. The UE 20 is also operable to selectively remove information from the RAN-level black list.<br>
[0072] Various modifications and adaptations may become apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts in view of the foregoing description, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. As but some examples, the use of other similar or equivalent message types, message formats and IE formats and constituent information may be attempted by those skilled in the art. [0073] Further, the exemplary embodiments of the invention may be used to advantage to solve the problems that arise in the 2G system case as discussed above, for example when the serving cell is using PBCCH/PCCCH and the mobile station is GPRS attached, as the mobile station would not need to check SI3/4 from the target cell.<br>
[0074] However, all such and similar modifications of the teachings of this invention will still fall within the scope of the non-limiting embodiments of this invention. <br>
[0075] Further, some of the features of the various non-limiting embodiments of this invention may be used to advantage without the corresponding use of other features. As such, the foregoing description should be considered as merely illustrative of the<br>
principles, teachings and exemplary embodiments of this invention, and not in limitation thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
