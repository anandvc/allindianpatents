				<td>The invention is in the field of coal carbonisation technology. More particularly it<br>
relates to the processing of coal tar obtained from coke ovens for getting an<br>
improved quality of extra hard pitch having a better coking value.<br>
Tar obtained from high temperature carbonisation of coal in coke ovens is<br>
dehydrated and heated in a pipe still furnace and distilled in an atmosphere<br>
column (Bubble plate column) at a temperature of 290-300°C. The products from<br>
the atmospheric column include residual light oils, taken as over heads, carbolic<br>
oil, naphthalene oil, and light wash oil as side streams and road tar as bottom<br>
product.<br>
This road tar fraction is again heated to about 320 - 340°C in the lower section of<br>
pipe still furnace and sent to pitch column, which is maintained, under vacuum of<br>
100 mm Hg The residual oil vapours from this column are separated into heavy<br>
wash oil and anthracene oil in the anthracene column, which also operates under<br>
vacuum. The bottom product of pitch column is a soft pitch, called running pitch<br>
is limited, it is further heat treated in a pitch blower, where compressed air is<br>
blown at a pressure of 4.5 - 5 Kg/cm2 for a period of 4 - 6 hrs., with or without<br>
addition of anthracene oil, in order to increase its softening point and coking<br>
residue. This final product is called extra hard pitch and is used making<br>
electrodes for Aluminum industries.<br>
The extra hard pitch, produced as described above, has low coking value which<br>
is in the range of 52-53%, while the Electro metallurgical industry, especially<br>
Aluminum industries, require extra hard pitch with a coking value more than 56%.<br>
Considering the need for improving the quality of the extra hard pitch for use as<br>
binder in the preparation of electrodes, particularly for Aluminum industry, the<br>
inventors concentrated their studies in the field of meeting the quality of extra<br>
hard pitch.<br>
As quality of extra hard pitch depends on the quality of soft pitch (running pitch),<br>
the inventors further concentrated on the quality improvement of running pitch<br>
being produced from road tar.<br>
After performing several investigations, based on detailed analysis of road tar<br>
and pitch as produced under different operating conditions, the inventors could<br>
develop a process by which properties of running pitch can be modified for<br>
making an extra hard pitch, having improved coking value, making the same<br>
suitable as binder for electrodes in different Electro metallurgical processes.<br>
Main object of the invention is, therefore, to produce an extra hard pitch having<br>
improved coking value to make the same suitable as binder for electrodes in the<br>
Electro-metallurgical processes. Coking value of conventional extra hard pitch<br>
lies in the range of 52 - 53%, while the coking value of the inventive product is<br>
more than 56% and is in the range of 56 - 57%. These and other improvement in<br>
properties like softening point etc. are all achieved by the process of the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention provides a process for producing improved extra hard pitch having<br>
improved coking value which comprises mixing anthracene oil with the road tar<br>
fraction obtained as residue from fractionating column of coal tar distillation and<br>
the mixture is heated before feeding to pitch column, maintained ata vacuum, for<br>
distillation. The residual oil vapours separated during distillation are separated<br>
into heavy wash oil and anthracene oil in the anthracene column, which also<br>
operates under vacuum. Anthracene oil obtained from the column can be used in<br>
this process.<br>
The invention, therefore, provides a method of producing improved extra hard<br>
pitch having improved coking value, which comprises mixing anthracene oil with<br>
the road tar fraction, obtained as residue from fractionating column of coal tar<br>
distillation, heating and injecting the mixture in the pitch distillation column<br>
maintained at vacuum, air blowing the residue of this column in pitch receivers for<br>
a period of 4-6 hrs. to get the product of the invention.<br>
Percentage of anthracene oil mixed with the road tar fraction is in the range of<br>
6 - 10% and the mixture is heated to a temperature of 350 - 370°C before<br>
introducing in the pitch distillation column.<br>
Improved properties of extra hard pitch of invention, as compared to conventional<br>
extra hard pitch, are shown in Table 1.<br>
Study on the use of anthracene oil and operating temperature and influence of<br>
the same on the coking value of extra hard pitch is shown in Fig. 1 of the<br>
accompanying drawing.<br>
Detailed Description of the Process<br>
For better understanding of the process the invention has been described with<br>
reference to the flow sheet supplied in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawing. In the<br>
flow sheet the modification has been marked to locate the advantages.<br>
In the process, as shown in the drawing, crude tar is pumped through a series of<br>
heat exchangers in which it abstracts heat from road tar fraction and is pumped in<br>
the dehydration tower at 140°C. The temperature of dehydration tower is<br>
maintained by circulating hot dehydrated tar through a coil in its base. Dry tar is<br>
pumped to the upper section of the coke oven gas fired pipe still furnace and<br>
injected into the atmospheric pressure fractionating column at a temperature of<br>
290 - 300°C. A portion of the road tar fraction, which is bottom product of<br>
atmospheric column, after coming through heat exchanger as shown in the<br>
drawing is mixed up with anthracene oil and is heated in the pipe still furnace and<br>
then introduced into the pitch column at about 350 - 370°C. Pitch column is<br>
maintained under vacuum and the residual oil vapours separated from pitch are<br>
separated into heavy wash oil and anthracene oil in anthracene column, which<br>
also operate under vacuum. Running pitch is collected from the base of the pitch<br>
column. It appear that the elevated temperature of the mixture of road tar fraction<br>
and anthracene oil in a specific concentration helps in the increasing the coking<br>
residue and that anthracene oil prevents the increase in viscosity and quinolene<br>
insoluble content. Extra hard pitch of the invention is produced by air blowing this<br>
running pitch in pitch receivers at a pressure of 4.5 - 5 Kg/cm2 for a period of<br>
4 - 6 hrs., with or without further addition of anthracene oil.<br>
