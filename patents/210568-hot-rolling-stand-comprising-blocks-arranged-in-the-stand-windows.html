Pages and Claims Incorporated Therein<br>
Bending Device fox" the t/jorking Rolls of a Hoc-Rolling Frame<br>
The invention relates to tolocks arranged in stand windov;s of hot roiling stands comprising hydraulic piston cylinder units provided as bending device which can transmit bending forces onto the chocks-of the working rolls via guide elements.<br>
Particularly in the case of cold-rolling stands it has been fcund to be beneficial to arrange bending devices for the working rolls i.n blocks V7hich are px^eferably arranged at least partially in the recesses of the stand beams. Difficulties resulted in connection with this Gonfigux'^ation because it is desired that the bending devices provide posicive as v;ell as negative forces and since, moreover, a relative movability of the wor-kmg rolls in the axial direction relative to one another is demanded. Critical in this connection is also the space req^airement of the bending devices which limits the possibilities of the support of the support rolls.<br>
DE 195 3 6 042 Al discloses a guide device for four-^high and multi-high cold-rolling stands which get by with one bending cylinder on each side of the chocks. An axial movement of the rolls is ensured in that the bending blocks are arranged moveably in axial guides fixedly connected to the stand window. These guides cause the stand windows to be greatly constricted.<br>
A transfer of the solutions found in connection with cold-rolling stands onto hot^rolling trains is practically impossible because the maximum forces to be developed here surpass those re-guired for cold rolling by a factor of 3 . In pa^rticular, it was found that at the operating pressure in cpiestion, the forces to be applied can no longer be developed by a single hydraulic piston cylinder unit of an acceptable si2:e, respectively; in the case of hot-rolling stands the blocks comprising bending devices have therefore been provided with a complex configuration and v;ith a number of, for example, 6 up to 12 parallel operating piston cylinder units, i.e., up to 24 piscon cylinder units per stand. Moreover, it was found co be disturbing chat the bending devices had such large dim.ensions chat a. free design of the support of the support rolls is no longer possible and, for example,, Morgoil bearings can no longer be used and rolling bearings have to be employed.<br>
The invention is thus based on the ob]ect to provide working roll<br><br>
bending devices of the aforenifjntionc-d kind which are capable of effecting the advancing forces to be applied by means of a single piston cylinder unit and whose dimensions are so small that a simple arrangement within the blocks tc be provided in the stand window is made possible and the free selection of the bearings of the: support rolls remains ensured.<br>
This object is solved by the features' of the claim. They make possible the configuration of bending devices which constrict the stand window only xnoderately and therefore provide sufficient space for the chocks of the support rolls as well as, their bearings,<br>
Expedient J inventive, and advantageous further developments of the subject matter of claim 1 are characterized in the dependent claims, In detail, the features of the invention are explained with the aid of the description of one erabodiment in connection with the drawing illustrating xt.<br>
In the Figure a beam 1 of a frame of a hot-rolling stand x'^ illustrated in a detail view and is provided with a bending device illustrated in vertical section. The important components of this bending device 2 are arranged m a hollovj-cylindrical housing 3 . A vertically movable pressure cylinder 4 contains in its upper widened area, which is guided within the housing 3. a piston 5 whose piston rod 6 is guided in the lower area of the px-essure cylinder 4, v;hich has a reduced outer diameter, within a plunger sleeve 7. The sleeve, in turn, is guided by the wear surfaces 8 of the housing 3. The piston rod 6 penetrates a flange of the plunger sleeve 7 and is supported thereon by means of a pressure ring 9 while the end bushing 11, secured by an end place 10, is able to transmit tensile forces of che piston rod 6. The end plate 10 is provided with a lateral nose which engages a cutout of the plunger sleeve 7 which nose, together with a bolt connected thereto, serves as a rotary securing means for the piston 5 and the piston rod 6,<br>
A guide element 12, 13 is connected co the end face of the pressure cylinder 4 as well as the lower fronc of the plunger sleeve. 7, respectively, and supported rearwardly m the stand window by and aligned with vertical wear plate, 14, 15.<br>
The working rolls 16, 17 of the hot-rolling stand, embodied as a four-high stand, are supported with bearingsy not illustrated, ixi the chocks 18, 19, These chocks have laterally projecting noses 20, 21 which engage grooves 22, 23 of che guide elements 12, 13 and are supported by means of pressure plates 24 against their<br><br>
flanks. The nose 21 is provided with a further pressure platse on which the complete working roll set can be moved for exchan::ring<br>
them,<br>
In operation the following function resulcs:<br>
Tha nose 20 of the chock; 18 secures the guide piece 12 by means of the pressure plates 24 supported on the flanks of the groove 22 at a height correlated with the working roll 16, while uhe position of the working roll 17 determines by the nose 21 and its pressure plates 2 4 supported on the flanks of the groove 23 the height of the guide element 13. The plunger sleeve 7 and the piston red 6 of the piston 5 are connected with the guide element 13, while the guide element 12 is screwed onto the pressure cylinder 4, This means that the position of the chocks 18 and 19 also decermines the position of the piston 5 in the pressure cylinder 4-Corresponding to the applied control, the upper and/or the lower cylinder chamber formed within the pressure cylinder 4 is nov; pressurized and thus the surfaces of the double-acting piscon 5 are correspondingly loaded. The forces which are thus developed on the piston surfaces are then transmitted to the guide elements 12, 13 which are verticcilly moveable by means of the guide surfaces of the pressure cylinder 4 and of plunger sleeve 7 in che housing 3 and load via the noses 20, 21 the chocks 18, 19 wich the reqi;ired pre-stress.<br>
For exchanging the rolls, the working rolls 16, 17 are lifted by the lifting rail 28 wherein the lowez: chock 19 is supported with its pressure plate 25 provided on the nose 21 on the lifting rail 28.<br>
For the exchange of rolls it is expedient and known to secure the parts of the bending device in the position predeterrtuned for the exchange of rolls in order to be able to recurn them without further adjustment after extending che roll. In the illustrated embodimenc a hydraulic cylinder 29 is provided here in a cutout of the beam 1 whose piston 30 is provided with a centering bolt 31. In the drawing this bolt is illustrated in the az'rested pesiuion in which che piston 30 is extended and the bolt 31 has been inserted into a recess of the guide piece 12, thereby holding ic at a constant height.<br><br>
