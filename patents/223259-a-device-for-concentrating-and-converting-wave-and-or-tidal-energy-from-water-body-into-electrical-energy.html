				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention is in relation to wave energy devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wave energy device for concentrating and directly converting wave and/ or tidal energy into electrical energy.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
The burning of fossil fuels to generate energy has resulted in releasing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere thus increasing the greenhouse effect and resulting in global warming. The need of the hour is to switch to alternate energy resources. Among the alternate energy resources ocean energy is considered to be the most promising. Ocean energy is a vital source of renewable energy. It is abundant, more constant than wind and solar energy, well distributed around the globe and near much of the world's population. Nonetheless, little use has been made of ocean energy due to the difficulties in converting wave and/ or tidal energy into a more useful form of energy by name electrical energy.<br>
Many ideas have been advanced for seeking ocean energy resources from the sea. Specifically they are: tidal power, ocean thermal energy gradient, wind, wind-induced waves, ocean currents, and salinity gradients. Of these, much effort in research and technological development has been devoted to the following: wave, tidal, wind, and ocean thermal energy.<br>
As an order of magnitude estimate, the power flux within a unit crest length of a plane wave train in deep water is proportional to the wave period and to the square of the wave amplitude. For a typical swell of 10-second period, the power flux rate is 40 kw/m if the amplitude is 1 m (gentle waves) and 1000 kw/m if the amplitude is 5 m (large waves). In terms of total theoretical power output for 1 m waves the power per km of coastline is 40 mw and for 5 m waves it is 1000 mw. Wave intensity is never steady and there is a large variability hourly, daily, and seasonally. The Sea environment is extremely hostile.<br>
It has a high availability factor (day and night) compared with other resources such as wind energy or solar energy. It has been estimated that if less than 0.1 % of the renewable energy available within the oceans could be converted to electricity, it would satisfy the present world demand for energy more than five times over.<br><br>
A number of wave energy devices were used in the past without much success as they were associated with high investment, corrosive salt-water environment, maintenance cost etc., This invention presents the development of a wave energy device wherein the wave and/ or tidal energy is concentrated and directly converted to electrical energy.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Most conventional technologies relating to generating electricity from ocean waves focus on extracting ocean wave energy from the motion of the ocean waves as the ocean waves migrate through the energy generating device, either using moving flows or using wind turbines driven by air trapped in enclosures above the waves. Prior art based on turbines, liquid pumps, hydraulics, air compressors, etc do not come within the concept of this invention. A broad range of patents are mentioned below to give an overall idea.<br>
US Patent No 2,501,696 (E. Souczek et al) describes usage of stream turbine device. However, the instant invention does not utilize any such turbine devices to convert wave and/ or tidal energy into electrical energy.<br>
US Patent No. 3,965,364 (Gustafson et al) describes usage of a device for utilizing energy stored in wave motion using propeller blades located at a depth where the water is not subjected to the vertical wave motion. However, the instant invention does not need any such propeller blades and the proposed device of instant invention can be installed either off shore or on shore.<br>
US Patent No. 3,209,156 (D. Struble et al) describes utilization of underwater generation unit. However, the proposed invention was not able to arrive at the instant application of invention, wherein a novel device is used to obtain extraordinarily high output..<br>
US Patent No. 4,045,148 (Morin et al) described utilization of turbine based generator system to convert wave and/ or tidal energy into electrical energy. However, the proposed invention is associated with turbines which are sensitive to corrosion and hence it is not able to arrive at the instant invention.<br>
US Patent No.4, 383,182 (Bowley et al) describes an apparatus includes a plurality of power producing modules disposed in a substantially constant velocity ocean current. However, the proposed invention was not able to arrive at the instant application of invention, wherein a novel device is used to obtain extraordinarily high output.<br><br>
US Patent Nos. 4,773,221 and 4,277,190 open ended hollow tube suspended beneath a float. The tube is being completely submerged and in a vertical orientation. The proposed invention utilizes the kinetic energy bound with waves of water. However the instant invention utilizes both kinetic and potential energy associated with waves and/ or tides from a body of water into electrical energy.<br>
US Patent No. 4,748,808 (Hill et al) describes a submersible fluid powered motor generator apparatus. However, the proposed invention was not able to arrive at the instant application of invention, wherein a novel device is used to obtain extraordinarily high output.<br>
US Patent No. 4,754,157 (Windle et al) describes utilization of float type wave energy extraction apparatus using cylinder with inlet and outlet check valves. However, the proposed invention was not able to arrive at the instant application of invention. US Patent Nos. 4,850,190 (Pitts et al) describes utilization of submerged ocean current electrical generators which and method for hydrogen production. However, the proposed invention was not able to arrive at the instant application of invention. US Patent No. 4,954,052 (Simmons et al) describes utilization of wave powered pump. The proposed invention suffers from the disadvantage of choking of pump over a period of time and leading to decrease in efficiency of the wave powered apparatus.<br>
US Patent No. 6,756,695 (D. Hibbs et al) describes a method of and apparatus for wave energy conversions using a float with excess buoyancy. However, the proposed invention was not able to arrive at the advantages of the instant invention. In all the prior arts there is a genuine difficulty in transforming high forces at low speeds into lower forces at higher speeds needed for electricity generation. The installation costs of such devices tend to be extremely large in comparison with the useful energy produced. In several instances the devices have to be fixed to the ocean floor and hence can be fixed advantageously only in shallow depths. There is no prior art coming anywhere closer to the invention cited herein.<br>
Since one of the main purposes of developing wave energy capturing devices is to reduce the cost of energy, the costs involved in maintaining and the manufacturing the wave energy capturing devices is a very important factor in the practicability of the devices. Thus, there is a need in the art for a wave energy extraction device which is inexpensive to manufacture and maintain.<br><br>

Brief description of the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows the base position of the device before wave strikes. Figure 2 shows the wave has struck and water level is rising up to half and crank shaft has turned up to the horizontal position.<br>
Figure 3 show the water level has taken the float to maximum level and the crankshaft is at the highest level.<br>
Figure 4 shows rear view of the device, wherein wave has receded and the float is pulling the crankshaft down on the other side.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, an open ended rigid tube (Like a large dia concrete pipe) is either fixed on a support from the ocean bed or floated vertically and moored with tiers such that the one end of the tube touches the ocean water surface and other is in the air vertically. A cylindrical inverted piston type float is made and floated inside the tube such that<br>
1.	It is partially buoyant on the water.<br>
2.	The outer diameter of the float is slightly less than the internal diameter of the rigid tube such that it can move freely throughout the tube.<br>
3.	The float should have a significant weight depending on size, partial buoyancy and other design consideration.<br>
4.	A minimum of one connecting rod is connected from the float to a fixed overhead crankshaft such that the ends of the rod are rotatable easily.<br><br>
5.	There is an opening at the tube end, which touches the sea surface. The opening is in the direction of the wave to permit the wave entry.<br>
6.	There is a concave curved wall attached to the wave opening such that the waves in the neighborhood are directed to the opening for wave entry into the tube.<br>
7.	When the waves hit the opening a surge of water rises up the rigid tube.<br>
8.	The partially buoyant inverted piston type float is also pushed up the rigid tube due to both kinetic and buoyant forces.<br>
9.	As the float rises the connecting rod pushes the overhead crankshaft and it starts to rotate.<br>
10.	The rigid tube is designed such that when the connecting rod has pushed the overhead crankshaft to the top position, the further gushing in of water are released from the top of the tube to the ocean either by overflowing or by provision of holes.<br>
11.	When the wave recedes, water level drops and the weight of the float tugs at the overhead crankshaft such that the circular motion is completed.<br>
12.	The length of the connecting rod and size of the crankshaft extension may be made based on design parameters for smooth rotating.<br>
13.	A gearbox having varying gear ratios is to be attached to the end of the crankshaft.<br>
14.	The load on the inverted piston type float may be varied by using the gear ratios in such a manner that, depending on wave conditions maximum power can be extracted and smooth running ensured.<br>
15.	The gearbox is in turn connected to the generator, which can generate current.<br>
16.	This device directly converts mechanically the kinetic and potential energy from the water into a rotary motion from which the current can be extracted.<br>
When a wave strikes the opening of the device the total energy per unit width of the<br>
crest<br>
E is given by:<br><br><br>
As the wave height and the weight of the seawater are very relevant in the energy calculation. The floating buoys or the oscillating water column does not convert the full momentum of the seawater and hence are inefficient. Whereas the instant invention will generate greater amount of electricity from the wave energy since the majority of the kinetic and potential energy is directly converted into greater torque in the crankshaft. When a wave and/ or tide approaches the wall (8) and enters the tube opening (5), it has kinetic energy. Water gushes up the hollow tube (1). The kinetic energy and the buoyant forces take up the float (2). As float (2) moves up the connecting rod (3) push the overhead crankshaft (4). In figure 2 the cylindrical inverted piston 2 has pushed the connecting rod (3) and crankshaft (4) has moved to the horizontal position. In figure 3 the water level has risen to highest level and the cylindrical inverted piston 2 has pushed the connecting rod (3), which in turn has pushed the overhead crankshaft (4) to the highest position thus completing half round. Figure 4 shows the rear side of the device.<br>
Thereafter the waves recede and the weight of the float (2) having potential energy tugs on the crankshaft (4) and it comes to the base position as in figure 1. Thus the forward stroke due to wave having kinetic energy has resulted in half round turning of the crankshaft and after the wave has receded, the downward stroke due to the potential energy of the cylindrical inverted piston results in the balance half round turning of the crankshaft. A cyclical repetition of these two strokes results in a continuous rotation of the crankshaft (4).<br>
The revolutions per minute of the crankshaft (4) depend on the wave frequency. The gearbox (6) attached to the crankshaft (4) will convert the slow rotary motion of the crankshaft to the faster revolutions required by the generator (6). The varying of the gear ratios based on the kinetic energy available in the wave can help tap maximum energy. The generator connected to the gearbox will generate the electricity. Let us assume that in a particular day the wave height has reduced. Then the total energy available in the wave is also reduced. In such a situation the torque that can be produced for a single upward stroke of the piston is also reduced. If the gear is set to such a ratio that the output speed is reduced (with lower current generation) then the lower torque will run the forward and downward stroke smoothly or else the equipment may stall and the entire revolution will not happen resulting in stoppage of current generation.<br><br>
If the wave height is more the energy released is greater. In such a case if the gear ratio is set to take on higher torque by increasing the output rotations per minute, the generator will run at greater speeds generating more current. By this method of varying the gear ratios maximum current extraction from varying wave heights can be achieved. The wave has got high force at low speeds. In the instant device every time the piston moves up due to wave action the torque transferred to the crank shaft is very high because of the direct transfer of the mechanical energy from the waves to the crankshaft. The gearbox with varying gear ratios can directly convert the high torque to high speeds of revolution. This high speed of revolution of the generator will generate more current. Hence our statement of achieving the transformation of high forces at low speeds into lower forces at higher speeds required for generation electricity.<br>
The invention is further elaborated with the help of following example(s). However, these example(s) should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Model tests of the applicant's instant wave energy device demonstrating the present<br>
invention have been completed on the below mentioned scale.<br>
A tank model of approximately 100 inches long and 50 inches wide has been used for the study. The test was done under normal wave patterns observed in wind generated waves (US Patent No.: 4,392,349). The generated waves and/ or tides were concentrated by walls towards the openings of the hollow tube. As the waves rise the float in the hollow tube there is increase in the height of water column. The kinetic energy and potential energy of the waves makes the float to move up and down which in turn rotates the overhead crankshaft. The gearbox having fixed gear ratio or variable gear ratio was selected according to the wave intensity and the generator was able to generate electrical energy.<br>
The device of the instant application converted up to 50 % of the wave and/or tidal energy into the electrical energy. The percentage value is calculated on the basis of input current for the pump generating the wave. The percentage values are calculated on the basis of conventional energy conversion factors.
