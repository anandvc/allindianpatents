				<td>The present disclosure is generally directed to antiviral compounds, and more specifically directed to compounds which inhibit the function of the NS 3 protease (also referred to herein as "serine protease") encoded by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), compositions comprising such compounds, and methods for inhibiting the function of the NS 3 protease.<br>
HCV is a major human pathogen, infecting an estimated 170 million persons worldwide - roughly five times the number infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. A substantial fraction of these HCV infected individuals develop serious progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. (Lauer, G. M.; Walker, B. D. N. Engl. J. Med 2001, 345, 41-52).<br>
Presently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha- interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in 40% of patients. (Poynard, T. et al. Lancet 1998, 352, 1426-1432). Recent clinical results demonstrate that pegylated alpha-interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy (Zeuzem, S. et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000, 343, 1666-1672). However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha- interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load. Thus, there is a clear and unmet need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection.<br>
HCV is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Based on a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence and the extensive similarity in the 5' untranslated region, HCV has been classified as a separate genus in the Flaviviridae family. All members of the Flaviviridae family have enveloped virions that contain a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins via translation of a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame.<br>
Considerable heterogeneity is found within the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence throughout the HCV genome. Six major genotypes have been characterized, and more than 50 subtypes have been described. The major genotypes of HCV differ in their distribution worldwide, and the clinical significance of the genetic heterogeneity of HCV remains elusive despite numerous studies of the possible effect of genotypes on pathogenesis and therapy. <br>
The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non- structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A- NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A is essential for efficient polyprotein processing, enhancing the proteolytic cleavage at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>

Where used in naming compounds of the present disclosure, the designations Pl', Pl, P2, P2*, P3, and P4, as used herein, map the relative positions of the amino acid residues of a protease inhibitor binding relative to the binding of the natural peptide cleavage substrate. Cleavage occurs in the natural substrate between Pl and Pl ' where the nonprime positions designate amino acids starting from the C-terminus end of the peptide natural cleavage site extending towards the iV-terminus; whereas, the prime positions emanate from the iV-terminus end of the cleavage site designation and extend toward the C-terminus. For example, Pl' refers to the first position away from the right hand end of the C-terminus of the cleavage site (i.e., iV-terminus first position); whereas Pl starts the numbering from the left hand side of the C-terminus cleavage site, P2: second position from the C-terminus, etc.). (see Berger A. &amp; Schechter L, Transactions of the Royal Society London series (1970), B257, <br>
249-264].<br>
The following figure shows the designations for the compounds of the present disclosure.<br>
Asymmetric centers exist in the compounds of the present disclosure. For example, the compounds may include Pl cyclopropyl element of formula<br>
wherein C1 and C2 each represent an asymmetric carbon atom at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclopropyl ring. Not withstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds, the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds can exist as racemic mixtures of diastereomers, such as the diastereomers wherein R is configured either syn to the amide or syn to the carbonyl as shown below. <br>
It should be understood that the disclosure encompasses all stereochemical isomeric forms, or mixtures thereof, which possess the ability to inhibit HCV protease. Individual stereoisomers of compounds can be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain chiral centers or by preparation of mixtures of enantiomeric products followed by separation such as conversion to a mixture of diastereomers followed by separation or recrystallization, chromatographic techniques, or direct separation of enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns. Starting compounds of particular stereochemistry are either commercially available or can be made and resolved by techniques known in the art.<br>
Certain compounds of the present disclosure may also exist in different stable conformational forms which may be separable. Torsional asymmetry due to restricted rotation about an asymmetric single bond, for example because of steric hindrance or ring strain, may permit separation of different conformers. The present disclosure includes each conformational isomer of these compounds and mixtures <br>
thereof.<br>
Certain compounds of the present disclosure may exist in zwitterionic form and the present disclosure includes each zwitterionic form of these compounds and mixtures thereof. When it is possible that, for use in therapy, therapeutically effective amounts of a compound of formula (I), as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be administered as the raw chemical, it is possible to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the disclosure further provides pharmaceutical compositions, which include therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The term "therapeutically effective amount," as used herein, refers to the total amount of each active component that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, e.g., a sustained reduction in viral load. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are as described above. The carrier(s), diluent(s), or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 250 milligram per kilogram ("mg/kg") body weight per day, preferably between about 0.05 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day of the compounds of the disclosure are typical in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic <br>
or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending on the condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound employed, the duration of treatment, and the age, gender, weight, and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compound is most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford antivirally effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects.<br>
When the compositions of this disclosure comprise a combination of a compound of the disclosure and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agent, both the compound and the additional agent are usually present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 150%, and more preferably between about 10 and 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual, or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, iiitrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, intravenous, or intradermal injections or infusions) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in- water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a <br>
similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing, and coloring agent can also be present.<br>
Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta- lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, betonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitable comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelating, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or and absorption agent such as betonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage, or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc, or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present disclosure can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a <br>
sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.<br>
Oral fluids such as solution, syrups, and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifϊers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners, or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added.<br>
Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax, or the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phopholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phophatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropyhnethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drag, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates, and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the <br>
epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, or oils.<br>
For treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in oil base.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges, pastilles, and mouth washes.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a course powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered, dose pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, or insufflators.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and soutes which render the formulation isotonic with the <br>
blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.<br>

The compounds of the present disclosure can be manufactured by methods known to those skilled in the art, see, for example, US Patent No. 6,323,180 and US Patent Appl. 20020111313 Al. The following methods set forth below are provided for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. It will be recognized that it may be preferred or necessary to prepare such a compound in which a functional group is protected using a conventional protecting group then to remove the protecting group to provide a compound of the present disclosure. The details concerning the use of protecting groups in accordance with the present disclosure are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present disclosure may, for example, be synthesized according to a general process as illustrated in Scheme I (wherein CPG is a carboxy protecting group and APG is an amino protecting group)<br>
Scheme I<br>
Briefly, the P 1 , P2, and P3 can be linked by well known peptide coupling techniques. The Pl, P2, and P3 groups may be linked together in any order as long as the final compound corresponds to peptides of the disclosure. For example, P3 can be linked to P2-P1; or Pl linked to P3-P2.<br>
Generally, peptides are elongated by deprotecting the α-amino group of the N-terminal residue and coupling the unprotected carboxy group of the next suitably <br>
N-protected amino acid through a peptide linkage using the methods described. This deprotection and coupling procedure is repeated until the desired sequence is obtained. This coupling can be performed with the constituent amino acids in stepwise fashion, as depicted in Scheme I. Coupling between two amino acids, an amino acid and a peptide, or two peptide fragments can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide) method, active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, Woodward reagent K-method, carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide method) can be enhanced by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase. More explicitly, the coupling step involves the dehydrative coupling of a free carboxy of one reactant with the free amino group of the other reactant in the present of a coupling agent to form a linking amide bond. Descriptions of such coupling agents are found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry", 2nd rev ed., Springer- Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993). Examples of suitable coupling agents are AζiV" '-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of N,N -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-ethyl-iV'-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. A practical and useful coupling agent is the commercially available (benzotriazol-l-yloxy)tris- (dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the present of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP. Another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-Λζ N, N',iV'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate. Still another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available O-(7-azabenzotrizol-l -y^-ΛζΛ^TV^iV'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. The coupling reaction is conducted in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. An excess of a tertiary amine, e.g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine or 4-DMAP is added to maintain the reaction mixture at a pH of about 8. The reaction temperature <br>
usually ranges between 0 °C and 50 °C and the reaction time usually ranges between 15 minutes and 24 hours.<br>
The functional groups of the constituent amino acids generally must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid formation of undesired bonds. Protecting groups that can be used are listed, for example, in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and "The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981). The α-amino group of each amino acid to be coupled to the growing peptide chain must be protected (APG). Any protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of such groups include: 1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as tβrt- butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6)trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl; and 7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. In certain embodiments the α-amino protecting group is either Boc or Fmoc. Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available.<br>
The α-amino protecting group of the newly added amino acid residue is cleaved prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCl in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0°C and room temperature (rt or RT), usually between 20-22°C.<br>
Any of the amino acids having side chain functionalities must be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above-described groups. Those <br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate protecting groups for these side chain functionalities depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide. The selection of such protecting groups is important in that the group must not be removed during the deprotection and coupling of the α-amino group.<br>
For example, when Boc is used as the α-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting group are suitable: /&gt;-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect the amino side chain of amino acids such as Lys and Arg; acetamidomethyl, benzyl (Bn), or fert-butylsulfonyl moieties can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect the hydroxy containing side chains of serine, threonine or hydroxyproline; and benzyl esters can be used to protect the carboxy containing side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.<br>
When Fmoc is chosen for the α-amine protection, usually tert-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for lysine and arginine, tert-butyl ether for serine, threonine and hydroxyproline, and tert-butyl ester for aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Triphenylmethyl (Trityl) moiety can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine.<br>
Once the elongation of the peptide is completed all of the protecting groups are removed. When a liquid phase synthesis is used, the protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups. These procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The α-carboxy group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected as an ester (CPG) that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include: 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilylethyl and tert-butyl, 2) arylalkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, or 3) esters that can be cleaved by mild base treatment or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters. The resulting α-carboxylic acid is coupled with a R6SO2NH2 in the presence of a peptide coupling agent. Compounds of the present disclosure can be prepared by many methods including those described in the examples below and as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,323,180 and published U.S. Patent Application US20020111313Al . <br>
Scheme II further shows the general process wherein compounds of Formula (I) (2) are constructed by the coupling of tripeptide carboxylic acid intermediate (1) with a PT sulfonamide. Said coupling reaction requires treatment of carboxylic acid (1) with a coupling reagent such as carbonyl diimidazole in a solvent such as THF, which can be heated to reflux, followed by the addition of the formed derivative of (1), to the PT sulfonamide, in a solvent such as THF or methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as DBU.<br>
Scheme II<br>
An alternative process for the construction of compounds of Formula (I) is shown in Scheme III. Therein the PT sulfonamide element is coupled to the Pl element using the process employed in Scheme I. The resulting Pl-PT moiety can then be deprotected at its amino terminus, hi this general example a Boc protecting group is employed but one skilled in the art would recognize that a number of suitable amino protecting groups could be employed in this process. Said Boc protecting group can be removed using acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as dichloroethane to provide the deprotected amine as the TFA salt. Said TFA amine salt can be directly employed in the subsequent coupling reaction or as an alternative the TFA amine salt can be first converted to the HCl amine salt, and this HCl amine salt is used in said coupling reaction as shown in Scheme III. The coupling of said HCl amine salt (3) with the carboxy terminus a P4-P3-P2 intermediate can be achieved using coupling reagents, such as HATU, in solvents such as dichloromethane to provide compounds of formula (4). <br>
Scheme III<br>
An alternative process for the construction of compounds of Formula (I) is shown in Scheme IV. Herein the hydrochloride salt of the Pl-Pl' terminal amine (1) is coupled to the free carboxy group of the P2 element using coupling agents such as PyBOP, in the presence of a base such as diisopropylamine, and in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting P2-P1-PT intermediate can be converted to compounds of Formula (I) (4) in a two step process wherein the first step is deprotection of the P2 amine terminus using an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting trifluoroacetic acid salt can be coupled with the carboxy terminus of the P4-P3 element using standard coupling agents such as PyBop in the presence of base such as diisopropylamine, and using solvents such methylene chloride to provide compounds of formula (4). <br>
Scheme IV<br>
The P4-P3-P2 intermediate utilized in the above schemes can be constructed as previously described with a further description of this process shown in general Scheme V. Therein the free carboxy terminus of the P4-P3 intermediate (1) can be coupled to the amino terminus of the P2 element to provide the P4-P3-P2 dipeptide (2). The carboxy terminus of the P4-P3-P2 intermediate can be deprotected by saponification of the ester group to provide P4-P3-P2 as the free carboxylic acid (3). Intermediates like (3) can be converted to compounds of Formula (I) using the methods described herein.<br>
Scheme V<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) can also be converted into other compounds of Formula (I) as described herein. An example of such a process is shown in Scheme VI wherein a compound of formula (1) which bears a hydroxy group at the P4 position is converted to a compound of formula (2) wherein said compound bears a 5 carbamate group at the P4 position. The conversion of (1) to (2) can be carried by treating (1) with a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as THF, followed by the addition of an isocyanate reagent to provide (2). As previously noted one skilled in the art will recognize that intermediate (1) can be used as starting material for the preparation of other compounds of Formula (I). 0 Scheme VI<br>
In the construction of compounds of Formula (I), the PT terminus is incorporated into the molecule using one of the general processes outlined above and described in more detail below, hi some examples the PT elements, that is the 5 cycloalkyl- or alkylsulfonamides, are commercially available or can be prepared from the corresponding alkyl- or cycloalkylsulfonyl chloride by treating said sulfonyl chloride with ammonia. Alternatively, these sulfonamides can be synthesized using the general process outlined in Scheme VII. Therein commercially available 3- chloropropylsulfonyl chloride (1) is converted to a suitable protected sulfonamide as O for example by treatment with fert-butylamine. The sulfonamide obtained (2) is then converted to the corresponding cycloalkylsulfonamide by treatment with two equivalents of a base such as butyllithium in a solvent such as THF at low temperature. The resulting cycloalkylsulfonamide can be deprotected by treatment with an acid to provide the desired unprotected cycloalkylsulfoamide. <br>
Scheme VII<br>
The Pl elements utilized in generating compounds of Formula (I) are in some cases commercially available, but are otherwise synthesized using the methods described herein and subsequently incorporated into compounds of Formula (I) using the methods described herein. The substituted Pl cyclopropylamino acids can be synthesized following the general process outline in Scheme VIII.<br>
Treatment of commercially available or easily synthesized imine (1) with 1,4- dihalobutene (2) in the presence of a base provides the resulting imine (3). Acid hydrolysis of (3) then provides (4), which has an allyl substiruent syn to the carboxy group, as the major product. The amine moiety of (4) can protected using a Boc group to provide the fully protected amino acid (5). This intermediate is a racemate which can be resolved by an enzymatic process wherein the ester moiety of (5) is cleaved by a protease to provide the corresponding carboxylic acid. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that this reaction is selective in that one of the enantiomers undergoes the reaction at a much greater rate than its mirror image providing for a kinetic resolution of the intermediate racemate. In the examples cited herein, the more preferred stereoisomer for integration into compounds of Formula (I) is (5a) which houses the (IR, 2S) stereochemistry. In the presence of the enzyme, this enantiomer does not undergo ester cleavage and thereby this enantiomer (5 a) is recovered from the reaction mixture. However, the less preferred enantiomer, (5b), which houses the (IS, 2R) stereochemistry undergoes ester cleavage, i.e., hydrolysis, to provide the free acid (6). Upon completion of this reaction, the ester (5a) can be separated from the acid product (6) by routine methods such as, for example, aqueous extraction methods or chromotography. <br>
Scheme VIII<br>
Procedures for making P2 intermediates and compounds of Formula (I) are shown in the schemes below. It should be noted that in many cases reactions are depicted for only one position of an intermediate. However, it is to be understood that such reactions could be used to impart modifications to other positions within this intermediate. Moreover, said intermediates, reaction conditions and methods given in the specific examples are broadly applicable to compounds with other substitution patterns. The general schemes outlined below are followed with examples herein. Both general and specific examples are non-limiting, as for example the isoquinoline nucleus is shown as part of the general scheme, Scheme IX, however, this pathway represents a viable process for the construction of alternate heterocycle substituents as replacements for the isoquinoline element, such as quinolines or qurnazolines. <br>
Scheme IX<br>
-R6<br>
Scheme IX shows the coupling of an N-protected C4-hydroxyproline moiety with a heterocycle to form intermediate (4) and the subsequent modification of said intermediate (4) to a compound of Formula (I) (5) by the process of peptide elongation as described herein. It should be noted that in the first step, the coupling of the C4-hydroxyproline group with the heteroaryl element, a base is employed. One skilled in the art would recognize that this coupling can be done using bases such as potassium fe/'t-butoxide or sodium hydride in solvent such as DMF or DMSO or THF. This coupling to the isoquinoline ring system occurs at the Cl position<br>
(numbering for isoquinoline ring system shown in intermediate 2 of Scheme DC) and is directed by the chloro group which is displaced in the process. It should be noted that alternative leaving groups can be utilized at this position such as a fluoride leaving group as shown in intermediate (3). Said fluoro intermediates (3) are available from the corresponding chloro compound using literature procedures described herein.<br>
It should be further noted that the position of the ring heteroatom(s) in intermediates like (2) of Scheme DC is also variable, as defined by the term heterocycle described herein. An alternative to the method described above for the coupling of the C4- hydroxyproline to aromatics and heteroaromatics is provided in the Mitsunobu reaction as depicted in step 1 of Scheme X. In this general reaction scheme a C4- hydroxyproline derivative is coupled to a quinazoline ring system. This reaction makes use of reagents such as triphenylphosphine and DEAD (diethylazodicarboxylate) in aprotic solvents such as THF or dioxane and can be used for the formation of aryl and heteroaryl ethers. Note that in the course of this <br>
coupling reaction the stereochemistry of the C4 chiral center in the C4- hydroxyproline derivative is inverted and thereby it is necessary to use the C4- hydroxyproline derivative housing the (S) stereochemistry at the C4 position as starting material. It should be noted that numerous modifications and improvements of the Mitsunobu reaction have been described in the literature.<br>
Scheme X<br>
In a subset of examples herein, isoquinolines are incorporated into the final compounds and specifically into the P2 region of said compounds. One skilled in the art would recognize that a number of general methods are available for the synthesis of isoquinolines. Moreoever, said isoquinolines generated by these methods can be readily incorporated into final compounds of Formula (I) using the processes described herein. One general methodology for the synthesis of isoquinolines is shown in Scheme XI, wherein cinnamic acid derivatives, shown in general form as structure (2) are converted to 1-chloroisoquinolines in a four step process. Said chloroisoquinolines can be subsequently used in coupling reactions to C4- hydroxyproline derivatives as described herein. The conversion of cinnamic acids to chloroquinolines begins with the treatment of cinnamic acid with an alkylcholorformate in the presence of a base. The resulting anhydride is then treated with sodium azide which results in the formation of an acylazide (3) as shown in the scheme. Alternate methods are available for the formation of acylazides from carboxylic acids as for example said carboxylic acid can be treated with diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) in an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of a base. In the next step of the reaction sequence the acylazide (3) is coverted to the corresponding isoquinolone (4) as shown in the scheme. The acylazide is heated to a temperature of approximately 190 °C in a high boiling <br>
solvent such a diphenylmethaαe. This reaction is general and provides moderate to good yields of substituted isoquinolone from the corresponding cinnamic acid derivatives. It should noted that said cinnamic acid derivatives are available commercially or can be obtained from the corresponding benzaldehyde (1) derivative by direct condensation with malonic acid or derivatives thereof and also by employing a Wittig reaction. The intermediate isoquinolones (4) of Scheme XI can be converted to the corresponding 1-cliloroisoquinoline by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride. This reaction is general and can be applied to any of the isoquinolones, quinolones or additional heterocycles as shown herein to covert a hydroxy substituent to the corresponding chloro compound when said hydroxy is in conjugation with a nitrogen atom in said heterocylic ring systems.<br>
Scheme XI<br>
An alternative method for the synthesis of the isoquinoline ring system is the Pomeranz-Fritsh procedure. This general method is outlined in Scheme XII. The process begins with the conversion of a benzaldehyde derivative (1) to a functionalized imine (2). Said imine is then converted to the isoquinoline ring system by treatment with acid at elevated temperature. This isoquinoline synthesis of Scheme XII is general, and it should be noted that this process is particularly useful in procuring isoquinoline intermediates that are substituted at the C8 position. The intermediate isoquinolines (3) can be converted to the corresponding 1- chloroquinolines (5) in a two step process as shown. The first step in this sequence is the formation of the isoquinoline N-oxide(4) by treatment of isoquinoline (3) with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane. <br>
Intermediate (4) can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinoline by treatment with phosphorous oxychloroide in refluxing chloroform. Note this two step process is general and can be employed to procure chloroisoquinolines and chloroquinolines from the corresponding isoquinolines and quinolines respectively.<br>
Scheme XII<br>
Another method for the synthesis of the isoquinoline ring system is shown in Scheme XIII. In this process an ortho-alkylbenzamide derivative (1) is treated with a strong base such as tert-butyllithium in a solvent such as THF at low temperature. To this reaction mixture is then added a nitrile derivative, which undergoes an addition reaction with the anion derived from deprotonation of (1), resulting in the formation of (2). This reaction is general and can be used for the formation of substituted isoquinolines. Intermediate (2) of Scheme XIII can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinoline by the methods described herein.<br>
Scheme XIII<br>
An additional method for the synthesis of isoquinolines is shown in Scheme XIV. The deprotonation of intermediate (1) using tert-butyllithium is described above. In the present method however, said intermediate anion is trapped by an ester, resulting in the formation of intermediate (2) as shown below. In a subsequent reaction ketone (2) is condensed with ammoniumn acetate at elevated temperature <br>
providing for the formation of quinolone (3). This reaction is general and can be applied for the construction of substituted isoquinolones which can then be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroisoquinolines as described herein.<br>
Scheme XIV<br>
Yet another method for the construction of isoquinolines is found in Scheme XV. In the first step of this process an ortho-alkylarylimine derivatives such as (1) is subjected to deprotonation conditions (sec-butyllithium, THF) and the resulting anion is quenched by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid derivative such as a Weinreb amide. The resulting keto imine (2) can be converted to the corresponding isoquinoline by condensation with ammonium acetate at elevated temperatures. This method is general and can be used for the synthesis of substituted isoquinolines. Said isoquinolines can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinoline by the methods described herein.<br>
Scheme XV<br>
The heterocycles described herein, and which are incorporated into the compounds of Formula (I), can be further functionalized. It is obvious to one skilled in the art that additional functionalization of said heterocycles can be done either before or after incorporation of these functionalities into compounds of Formula (I). The following schemes illustrate this point. For example, Scheme XVI shows the conversion of a l-chloro-6-fluoroisoquinoline to the corresponding l-chloro-6- alkoxy-isoquinoline species, by treatment of (1) with a sodium or potassium alkoxide species in the alcohol solvent from which the alkoxide is derived at room <br>
temperature. In some cases it may be necessary to heat the reaction to drive it to completion. Said chloroquinoline can be incorporated into a compound of Formula (I) using the art described herein.<br>
Scheme XVI<br>
Scheme XVTI provides a general example for the modification of heterocycles as defined herein by employing palladium mediated coupling reactions. Said couplings can be employed to functionalize a heterocycle at each position of the ring system providing said ring is suitably activated or functionalized, as for example with a chloride as shown in the scheme. This sequence begins with 1-chloroisoquinoline (1) which upon treatment with metachloroperbenzoic acid can be converted to the corresponding N-oxide (2). Said intermediate (2) can be converted to the corresponding 1,3-dichloroisoquinoline (3) by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride in refluxing chloroform. Intermediate (3) can be coupled with N-Boc-4- hydroxyproline by the methods described herein to provide intermediate (5) as shown in the scheme. Intermediate (5) can undergo a Suzuki coupling with an aryl boronic acid, in the presence of a palladium reagent and base, and in a solvent such as THF or toluene or DMF to provide the C3-arylisoquinoline intermediate (6). Heteroarylboronic acids can also be employed in this Pd mediated coupling process to provide C3-heteroarylisoquinolines. Intermediate (6) can be converted into final compounds of Formula (I) by the methods described herein. <br>
Scheme XVII<br>
Palladium mediated couplings of heteroaryl systems with aryl or heteroaryl elements can also be employed at a later synthetic stage in the construction of compounds of Formula (I) as shown in Scheme XVIII. Therein tripeptide acylsulfonamide intermediate (1) is coupled to a l-chloro-3-bromoisoquinoline (2) using the previously described process of alkoxide displacement of an heteroarylhalo moiety to provide intermediate (3). The coupling of (1) and (2) is most efficient in the presence of a catalyst such as lanthanum chloride as described herein. The isoquinoline ring system of intermediate (3) can be further functionalized by employing either Suzuki couplings (Process 1: subjecting (3) to heteroaryl or aryl boronic acids in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine) and a base such as cesium carbonate in solvents such as DMF) or Stille couplings (Process 2: subjecting (3) to heteraryl or aryl tin dervatives in the presence of palladium catalyst such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine in solvents such as toluene). <br>
Scheme XVIII<br>
Palladium reactions can also be employed to couple C4-amino proline elements with functionalized heterocycles. Scheme XX shows intermediate (1) coupling with a functionalized isoquinoline in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base in a solvent such as toluene. Intermediates like (3) can be converted to compounds of Formula (I) using the methods described herein.<br>
Scheme XIX<br>
The construction of functionalized isoquinoline ring systems is also possible employing [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. For example, as shown in Scheme XX, the use of vinyl isocyantes (1) in cycloaddition reactions with compounds of formula (2) provides functionalized isoquinolones (3). Said isoquinolines can be incorporated into compounds of Formula (I) using the methods described herein. <br>

Biological Studies HCV NS3/4A protease complex enzyme assays and cell-based HCV replicon assays were utilized in the present disclosure, and were prepared, conducted and validated as follows:<br>
Generation of recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex HCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS strain, H77 strain or<br>
J4L6S strain, were generated, as described below. These purified recombinant proteins were generated for use in a homogeneous assay (see below) to provide an indication of how effective compounds of the present disclosure would be in <br>
inhibiting HCV NS3 proteolytic activity.<br>
Serum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained from Dr. T. Wright, San Francisco Hospital. An engineered full-length cDNA (compliment deoxyribonucleic acid) template of the HCV genome (BMS strain) was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA<br>
(ribonucleic acid) and using primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype Ia strains. From the determination of the entire genome sequence, a genotype Ia was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (See P Simmonds, KA Rose, S Graham, SW Chan, F McOmish, BC Dow, EA Follett, PL Yap and hours Marsden, J. Clin. Microbiol, 31(6), 1493-1503 (1993)). The amino acid sequence of the nonstructural region, NS2-5B, was shown to be &gt;97% identical to HCV genotype Ia (H77) and 87% identical to genotype Ib (J4L6S). The infectious clones, H77 (Ia genotype) and J4L6S (Ib genotype) were obtained from R. Purcell (NIH) and the sequences are published in Genbank (AAB67036, see Yanagi,M., Purcell,R.H., Emerson,S.U. and Bukh,J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94(16), 8738-8743 (1997); AF054247, see Yanagi,M., St Claire,M., Shapiro,M., Emerson,S.U., Purcell,R.H. and Bukh,J, Virology 244 (1), 161-172. (1998)).<br>
The H77 and J4L6S strains were used for production of recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes. DNA encoding the recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex (amino acids 1027 to 1711) for these strains was manipulated as described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Paolini C, Brennan D, Nardi C, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 38(17):5620-32, (1999)). Briefly, a three-lysine solubilizing tail was added at the 3'-end of the NS4A coding region. The cysteine in the Pl position of the NS4A-NS4B cleavage site (amino acid 1711) was changed to a glycine to avoid the proteolytic cleavage of the lysine tag. Furthermore, a cysteine to serine mutation was introduced by PCR at amino acid position 1454 to prevent the autolytic cleavage in the NS3 helicase domain. The variant DNA fragment was cloned in the pET21b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) and the NS3/4A complex was expressed in Escherichia, coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) following the protocol described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Brennan D, Nardi C, Brunetti M, Tomei L, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R., J Virol. 72(8):6758- 69 (1998)) with modifications. Briefly, the NS3/4A protease complex expression <br>
was induced with 0.5 millimolar (mM) Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 22 hours (h) at 20°C. A typical fermentation (1 Liter (L)) yielded approximately 10 grams (g) of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mL/g) consisting of 25 rnM N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)Piperazine-iV'-(2-Ethane Sulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 500 mM Sodium Chloride (NaCl), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 microgram/milliliter ("μg/mL") lysozyme, 5 mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2), 1 μg/ml Dnasel, 5mM β-Mercaptoethanol (βME), Protease inhibitor-Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic acid (EDTA) free (Roche), homogenized and incubated for 20 minutes (min) at 4°C. The homogenate was sonicated and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 235000 g for 1 hour at 4°C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 15 mM and the pH adjusted to 8.0. The crude protein extract was loaded on a Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column pre- equilibrated with buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 15 mM imidazole, 5 mM βME). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer C (same as buffer B except with 0.2% Triton X-100). The protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer D (same as buffer C except with 200 mM Imidazole).<br>
NS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and loaded on a desalting column Superdex-S200 pre-equilibrated with buffer D (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X- 100, 10 mM βME). Sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. NS 3/4 A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to approximately 0.5 mg/ml. The purity of the NS3/4A protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77 and J4L6S strains, were judged to be greater than 90% by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses. The enzyme was stored at -80 °C, thawed on ice and diluted prior to use in assay buffer.<br>
FRET peptide assay to monitor HCV NS3/4A proteolytic activty The purpose of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS strain, H77 strain or J4L6S strain, as described above, by compounds of the present disclosure. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present disclosure would be in inhibiting HCV NS3 proteolytic activity. <br>
In order to monitor HCV NS3/4A protease activity, an NS3/4A peptide substrate was used. The substrate was RET Sl (Resonance Energy Transfer Depsipeptide Substrate; AnaSpec, Inc. cat # 22991) (FRET peptide), described by Taliani et al. in Anal. Biochem. 240(2):60~67 (1996). The sequence of this peptide is loosely based on the NS4A/NS4B natural cleavage site for the HCV NS3 protease except there is an ester linkage rather than an amide bond at the cleavage site. The peptide also contains a fluorescence donor, EDANS, near one end of the peptide and an acceptor, DABCYL, near the other end. The fluorescence of the peptide is quenched by intermolecular resonance energy transfer (RET) between the donor and the acceptor, but as the NS3 protease cleaves the peptide the products are released from RET quenching and the fluorescence of the donor becomes apparent.<br>
The peptide substrate was incubated with one of the three recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes, in the absence or presence of a compound of the present disclosure. The inhibitory effects of a compound were determined by monitoring the formation of fluorescent reaction product in real time using a Cytofluor Series 4000.<br>
The reagents were as follow: HEPES and Glycerol (Ultrapure) were obtained from GIBCO-BRL. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) was obtained from Sigma, β- Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Bio Rad.<br>
Assay buffer: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl; 0.1% Triton; 15% Glycerol; 10 mM βME. Substrate: 2 μM final concentration (from a 2 mM stock solution in DMSO stored at -20°C). HCV NS3/4A protease type Ia (Ib), 2-3 nM final concentration (from a 5 μM stock solution in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-XIOO, 10 mM βME).. For compounds with potencies approaching the assay limit, the assay was made more sensitive by adding 50 μg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) to the assay buffer and reducing the end protease concentration to 300 pM.<br>
The assay was performed in a 96-well polystyrene black plate from Falcon. Each well contained 25 μl NS3/4A protease complex in assay buffer, 50 μl of a compound of the present disclosure in 10% DMSO/assay buffer and 25 μl substrate in assay buffer. A control (no compound) was also prepared on the same assay plate.<br>
The enzyme complex was mixed with compound or control solution for 1 min before initiating the enzymatic reaction by the addition of substrate. The assay plate was <br>
read immediately using the Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosystems). The instrument was set to read an emission of 340 nm and excitation of 490 nm at 25°C. Reactions were generally followed for approximately 15 min.<br>
The percent inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br>
where δF is the change in fluorescence over the linear range of the curve. A nonlinear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (ICs0) was calculated by the use of Excel XLfit software using the equation, y=A+((B-A)/(l+((C/x)ΛD))). All of the compounds tested were found to inhibit the activity of the NS 3/4 A protease complex with IC50's of 8 μM or less. Further, compounds of the present disclosure, which were tested against more than one type of NS3/4A complex, were found to have similar inhibitory properties though the compounds uniformly demonstrated greater potency against the Ib strains as compared to the Ia strains.<br>
Specificity Assays<br>
The specificity assays were performed to demonstrate the in vitro selectivity of the compounds of the present disclosure in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease complex as compared to other serine or cysteine proteases. The specificities of compounds of the present disclosure were determined against a variety of serine proteases: human neutrophil elastase (HNE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and human pancreatic chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases, a 96-well plate format protocol using colorimetric p-nitroaniline (pNA) substrate or fluorometric Amino-Methyl-Coumarin (AMC) substrate, specific for each enzyme was used as described previously (PCT<br>
Patent Application No. WO 00/09543) with some modifications. All enzymes were purchased from Sigma or EMDbiosciences while the substrates were from Bachem. Each pNA assay included a 2 hours enzyme-inhibitor pre-incubation at room temperature followed by addition of substrate and hydrolysis to -15% conversion as measured on a Spectramax Pro microplate reader. The cathepsin B assay was initiated by adding substrate to a 10 min enzyme-inhibitor pre-incubation at room temperature, and the assay plate measured immediately using the Cytofluor Series <br>
4000. Compound concentrations varied from 100 to 0.4 μM depending on their potency.<br>
The final conditions for each assay were as follows:<br>
50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) pH 8, 0.5 M Sodium Sulfate (Na2SO4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3% DMSO, 0.01 % Tween- 20 with:<br>
133 μM succ-AAA-pNA and 20 nM HNE or 8 nM PPE; 100 μM succ-AAPF-pNA and 250 pM Chymotrypsin.<br>
100 mM NaHPO4 (Sodium Hydrogen Phosphate) pH 5.5, 3% DMSO, 1 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), 5 nM Cathepsin B (enzyme stock activated in buffer containing 20 mM TCEP before use), and 2 μM Z-FR-AMC diluted in H2O.<br>
The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the formula:<br>
[^((UViΛ-UVbia^UVctl-UVbiank))] X 100 A non-linear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated by the use of Excel XLfit software.<br>
Generation of HCV Replicon An HCV replicon whole cell system was established as described by<br>
Lohmann V, Korner F, Koch J, Herian U, Theilmann L, Bartenschlager R., Science 285(5424): 110-3 (1999). This system enabled us to evaluate the effects of our HCV Protease compounds on HCV RNA replication. Briefly, using the HCV strain Ib sequence described in the Lohmann paper (Assession number: AJ238799), an HCV cDNA was synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA), and the full- length replicon was then assembled in plasmid pGem9zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) using standard molecular biology techniques. The replicon consists of (i) the HCV 5' UTR fused to the first 12 amino acids of the capsid protein, (ii) the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo), (iii) the IRES from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and (iv) HCV NS3 to NS5B genes and the HCV 3 ' UTR. Plasmid DNAs were linearized with Seal and RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using the T7 MegaScript transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to manufacturer's <br>
directions. In vitro transcripts of the cDNA were transfected into the human hepatoma cell line, HUH-7. Selection for cells constitutively expressing the HCV replicon was achieved in the presence of the selectable marker, neomycin (G418). Resulting cell lines were characterized for positive and negative strand RNA production and protein production over time.<br>
HCV Replicon FRET Assay<br>
The HCV replicon FRET assay was developed to monitor the inhibitory effects of compounds described in the disclosure on HCV viral replication. HUH-7 cells, constitutively expressing the HCV replicon, were grown in Dulbecco's<br>
Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) (Gibco-BRL) containing 10% Fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml G418 (Gibco-BRL). Cells were seeded the night before (1.5 x 104 cells/well) in 96-well tissue-culture sterile plates. Compound and no compound controls were prepared in DMEM containing 4% FCS, 1:100 Penicillin/Streptomysin (Gibco-BRL), 1 : 100 L-glutamine and 5% DMSO in the dilution plate (0.5% DMSO final concentration in the assay). CompounάVDMSO mixes were added to the cells and incubated for 4 days at 37°C. After 4 days, cells were first assessed for cytotoxicity using alamar Blue (Trek Diagnotstic Systems) for a CC50 reading. The toxicity of compound (CC50) was determined by adding 1/10 volume of alamarBlue to the media incubating the cells. After 4 h, the fluorescence signal from each well was read, with an excitation wavelength at 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 580 nm, using the Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosystems). Plates were then rinsed thoroughly with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (3 times 150 μl). The cells were lysed with 25 μl of a lysis assay reagent containing an HCV protease substrate (5X cell Luciferase cell culture lysis reagent<br>
(Promega #E153A) diluted to IX with distilled water, NaCl added to 150 mM final, the FRET peptide substrate (as described for the enzyme assay above) diluted to 10 μM final from a 2 mM stock in 100% DMSO. The plate was then placed into the Cytofluor 4000 instrument which had been set to 340 nm excitation/490 nm emissions, automatic mode for 21 cycles and the plate read in a kinetic mode. EC50 determinations were carried out as described for the IC5Q determinations. <br>
HCV Replicon Luciferase Reporter Assay<br>
As a secondary assay, EC50 determinations from the replicon FRET assay were confirmed in a replicon luciferase reporter assay. Utilization of a replicon luciferase reporter assay was first described by Krieger et al (Krieger N, Lohmann V, and Bartenschlager R, J. Virol. 75 (10): 4614-4624 (2001)). The replicon construct described for our FRET assay was modified by inserting cDNA encoding a humanized form of the Renilla luciferase gene and a linker sequence fused directly to the 3 '-end of the luciferase gene. This insert was introduced into the replicon construct using an Ascl restriction site located in core, directly upstream of the neomycin marker gene. The adaptive mutation at position 1179 (serine to isoleucine) was also introduced (Blight KJ, Kolykhalov, AA, Rice, CM, Science 290(5498): 1972-1974). A stable cell line constitutively expressing this HCV replicon construct was generated as described above. The luciferase reporter assay was set up as described for the HCV replicon FRET assay with the following modifications. Following 4 days in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator, cells were analyzed for Renilla Luciferase activity using the Promega Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System. Media (100 μl) was removed from each well containing cells. To the remaining 50 μl of media, 50 μl of Dual-Glo Luciferase Reagent was added, and plates rocked for 10 min to 2 hours at room temperature. Dual-Glo Stop &amp; GIo Reagent (50 μl) was then added to each well, and plates were rocked again for an additional 10 min to 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on a Packard TopCount NXT using a luminescence program.<br>
The percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula below: % control = average luciferase signal in experimental wells (+ compound) average luciferase signal in DMSO control wells (- compound)<br>
The values were graphed and analyzed using XLfit to obtain the EC5O value.<br>
Representative compounds of the disclosure were assessed in the HCV enzyme assays, HCV replicon cell assay and/or in several of the outlined specificity assays. For example, Compound 56 was found to have an IC50 of 99 nanomolar (nM) <br>
against the NS3/4A BMS strain in the enzyme assay. Similar potency values were obtained with the published H77 (IC50 of 17 nM) and J4L6S (IC50 of 9.8 nM) strains. The EC50 value in the replicon FRET assay was 742 nM and 247 nM in the replicon Luciferase assay.<br>
In the specificity assays, the same compound was found to have the following activity: HLE &gt; 100 μM; PPE &gt; 100 μM; Chymotrypsin &gt; 100 μM; Cathepsin B &gt; 100 μM. These results indicate this family of compounds is highly specific for the NS3 protease and many of these members inhibit HCV replicon replication.<br>
The compounds of the current disclosure were tested and found to have activities in the ranges as follow:<br>
IC50 Activity Range (for compounds tested): A is &gt; 1 μM; B is 0.1-1 μM; C is  5 μM; B is 0.5-5 μM; C is 
In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, the compounds have a biological activity (EC50) of 5 μM or less, and in another embodiment, 0.5 μM or less.<br>
Table 1 shows the IC50 and EC50 values for representative compounds. Those examples which are not contained within the earlier examples can be prepared by following the procedures described in the examples and schemes by substituting the appropriate starting materials.<br>
