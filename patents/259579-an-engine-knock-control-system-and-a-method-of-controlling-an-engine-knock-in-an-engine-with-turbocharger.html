ENGINE KNOCK CONTROL FOR TURBOCHARGED ENGINES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more particularly to knock control in a turbocharged engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Internal combustions engines combust an air and fuel (A/F)<br>
mixture within cylinders to produce drive torque. More specifically, the<br>
combustion events reciprocally drive pistons that drive a crankshaft to provide<br>
torque output from the engine. The A/F mixture is ignited or sparked at a<br>
desired crank angle. In some instances, however, the A/F mixture ahead of<br>
the flame-front auto-ignites within the cylinder resulting in undesired engine<br>
knock.<br>
[0003] Accordingly, engine knock control systems have been<br>
developed to detect and to mitigate engine knock. One such engine knock<br>
control system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,560,337, entitled Knock<br>
Control Using Fuzzy Logic, and issued on October 1, 1996. Such traditional<br>
systems detect the propensity for a particular cylinder to auto-ignite and retard<br>
the cylinder spark timing to avoid engine knock. Although engine knock is<br>
avoided, exhaust gas temperatures increase as a result of the retarded spark<br>
timing.<br>
[0004] Some internal combustion engines include a turbocharger,<br>
which increases the charge air density ingested by the engine. The<br>
turbocharger is driven by the exhaust gas, whereby the heat energy of the<br>
exhaust gas is transformed into mechanical energy to compress the air<br>
entering the engine. In turbocharged engines, engine knock will occur at high<br>
loads, especially when a low octane (e.g., 85 octane) fuel is used.<br>
Consequently, a persistent knock condition can occur.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005] Traditional engine knock control systems do not sufficiently<br>
mitigate engine knock when applied in a boosted internal combustion engine.<br>
More specifically, traditional engine knock control systems retard spark in<br>
order to mitigate engine knock. However, spark retard results in higher<br>
exhaust temperatures, which in turn result in increased boost of the<br>
turbocharger (i.e., higher temperatures means higher heat energy, which<br>
results in increased turbocharger boost). Consequently, engine knock<br>
actually increases as a result of spark retard. Accordingly, the spark retard is<br>
continuously increased until the spark retard authority is fully consumed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present invention provides an engine knock<br>
control system for an engine including a turbocharger. The engine knock<br>
control system includes a first module that determines octane scalars<br>
indicative of an engine knock propensity for each cylinder of the engine<br>
system and a second module that determines a cylinder air mass limit based<br>
on the octane scalars. A third module limits a boost output of the<br>
turbocharger based on the cylinder air mass limit.<br>
[0007] In another feature, the cylinder air mass limit is determined<br>
based on a maximum of the octane scalars.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the cylinder air mass limit is further<br>
determined based on an engine RPM.<br>
[0009] In still another feature, the engine knock control system<br>
further includes a fourth module that determines a spark retard for each<br>
cylinder respectively based on the octane scalars.<br>
[0010] In yet another feature, the third module limits a boost output<br>
of the turbocharger by actuating a waste gate valve to selectively detour an<br>
exhaust gas from entering the turbocharger.<br><br>
3<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012] The present invention will become more fully understood<br>
from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0013] Figure 1 is a functional block diagram of an engine system<br>
including a turbo charger;<br>
[0014] Figure 2 is a graph illustrating exemplary cylinder mass air<br>
limit traces based on octane scalar values and engine RPM;<br>
[0015] Figure 3 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary steps executed<br>
by the turbocharged engine knock control of the present invention; and<br>
[0016] Figure 4 is a functional block diagram of exemplary modules<br>
that execute the turbocharged engine knock control of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit,<br>
and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br><br>
4<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine system 10 is<br>
illustrated. The engine system 10 includes an engine 12 having an intake<br>
manifold 14 and an exhaust manifold 16. Air and fuel are mixed and the<br>
air/fuel mixture is combusted within cylinders 18 of the engine 12. Although<br>
the exemplary engine illustrated in Figure 1 includes 4 cylinders, it is<br>
anticipated that the engine can include more or fewer cylinders. For example,<br>
engines having 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders are anticipated.<br>
[0019] The engine system 10 further includes a turbocharger 20.<br>
Exhaust gas exiting the exhaust manifold drives the turbocharger 20, which<br>
compresses air that is drawn into the engine from atmosphere through an air<br>
filter 22 and an air cooler 24. The compressed air is metered into the intake<br>
manifold 14 through a throttle 26. The turbocharger 20 further includes a<br>
waste gate 28 that is actuated to detour the exhaust gas exiting the exhaust<br>
manifold 16. More specifically, the exhaust gas can be selectively detoured<br>
such that it does not drive the turbocharger 20. In this manner, the amount of<br>
boost provided by the turbocharger 20 can be regulated.<br>
[0020] A control module 30 regulates operation of the engine<br>
system 10 based on the turbocharged engine knock control of the present<br>
invention. More specifically, the control module 30 regulates operation of the<br>
throttle 26 and the waste gate 28 of the turbocharger 20 based on a plurality<br>
of engine operating parameters. A mass air flow (MAF) sensor 32 generates<br>
a MAF signal based on the air flow into the engine system 10 and an intake<br>
air temperature sensor 34 generates a signal based on the temperature of the<br>
intake air (TIA). A manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 36 generates a<br>
MAP signal and an engine temperature sensor 38 generates a signal based<br>
on an engine temperature (TENG). TENG can be based on the temperature of a<br>
coolant flow through the engine system 10. An engine speed sensor 40<br>
generates an RPM signal based on the rotational speed of a crankshaft (not<br>
shown).<br><br>
5<br>
[0021] An engine knock sensor 42 is provided and can include any<br>
vibration sensor or other sensor known in the art to produce a signal based on<br>
a knock related engine parameter. For example, a sensor that senses engine<br>
vibration within a predetermined frequency range is anticipated. A knock<br>
count CKNOCK is generated based on the signal of the engine knock sensor 42,<br>
and includes a counter value that is periodically cleared and that is<br>
incremented upon identification of a sensed knock event or condition. It is<br>
also anticipated that a knock processor (not shown) can be implemented to<br>
reduce signal noise.<br>
[0022] The turbocharged engine knock control of the present<br>
invention is partially based on the engine knock control disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,560,337, entitled Knock Control Using Fuzzy Logic, and issued<br>
on October 1, 1996, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein<br>
by reference. More specifically, the turbocharged engine knock control<br>
determines a knock propensity value or octane scalar for each cylinder 18 of<br>
the engine 12. The octane scalar varies between 0 and 1. A value of 0<br>
indicates no propensity to knock and a value of 1 indicates a very high<br>
propensity to knock. A maximum air mass per cylinder is determined based<br>
on the octane scalars and the maximum boost of the turbocharger 20 is<br>
limited such that the maximum air mass per cylinder is not exceeded. In this<br>
manner, turbocharger boost is limited to inhibit increased engine knock, which<br>
would otherwise result from increased boost. Additionally, spark retard<br>
authority is maintained at usable levels.<br>
[0023] The turbocharged engine knock control monitors engine<br>
operating parameters including, but not limited to, TIA, MAP, TENG, CKNOCK and<br>
RPM. A base spark timing is determined based on MAP and RPM. For<br>
example, the base spark timing can be determined from a look-up table based<br>
on MAP and RPM. A retarded spark timing is subsequently determined<br>
based on the octane scalar.<br><br>
6<br>
[0024] Although a brief description of calculation of the octane<br>
scalar is provided herein, a more detailed description is provided in U.S.<br>
Patent Np. 5,560,337, described above. The octane scalar is determined as<br>
the ratio between a numerator value (NUM) and a denominator value<br>
(DENOM). NUM and DENOM are determined based on a plurality of<br>
membership functions that are consistent with fuzzy logic control, wherein the<br>
above-described operating parameters are sub-divided into a plurality of<br>
categories. For example, TENG is subdivided into the categories of low temp,<br>
high temp and not low temp, MAP is subdivided into low pressure and high<br>
pressure, and RPM is sub-divided into low speed and high speed.<br>
[0025] The membership functions are applied to a knowledge rule<br>
base to determine a set of associated truths after determining membership<br>
function output values. The rules forming the rule base are determined in an<br>
analysis of the impact of the membership functions on engine knock<br>
propensity. After determining the truths, NUM and DENOM are used to<br>
compute the octane scalar. More specifically, the octane scalar is computed<br>
as a weighted sum of NUM and DENOM, each of which is summed over each<br>
truth. NUM and DENOM are calculated based on the following equations:<br>
NUM	=	NUM+TRUTH(n)*POS(n)*WEIGHT(n)<br>
DENOM = DENOM+TRUTH(n)*WEIGHT(n)<br>
where n is the truth number, POS is a position value and WEIGHT is a<br>
weighting value. The position values may be determined in a calibration step<br>
as the extent that the associated truth indicates engine knock propensity. The<br>
weight values are used to weight the truths with respect to each other, to<br>
reflect any variance in the degree by which the rules indicate a knock<br>
propensity.<br>
[0026] Once the octane scalar is calculated for a particular cylinder,<br>
the retarded spark timing is determined for that cylinder based thereon.<br>
Further, the turbocharged engine spark control determines a cylinder air mass<br>
limit as a function of the maximum octane scalar value for each of the<br>
cylinders and the engine RPM. More specifically, a look-up table can be<br><br>
7<br>
implemented using the maximum octane scalar value and engine RPM as<br>
inputs. The graph of Figure 2 illustrates exemplary cylinder mass air limit<br>
traces based on the octane scalar value and the engine RPM. The boost<br>
provided by the turbocharger 20 is limited based on the cylinder air mass limit.<br>
In this manner, the pressure decreases the propensity for engine knock<br>
thereby reducing the need to retard the spark timing.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
turbocharged engine knock control will be described in detail. In step 200,<br>
control monitors the engine operating parameters including, but not limited to,<br>
TIA, MAP, TENG, CKNOCK and RPM. In step 202, control calculates the octane<br>
scalar for each cylinder. Control determines the spark timing for each cylinder<br>
based on its corresponding octane scalar in step 204. In step 206, control<br>
determines the cylinder mass air limit based on the maximum octane scalar<br>
value and the engine RPM. In step 208, control limits the maximum<br>
turbocharger boost based on the cylinder air mass limit and control ends.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute<br>
the turbocharged engine knock control will be described in detail. The<br>
exemplary modules include an octane scalar determining module 300, a spark<br>
retard calculating module 302, an engine ignition control module 304, a<br>
cylinder air mass limit determining module 306 and a turbocharger control<br>
module 308. The octane scalar determining module 300 determines the<br>
octane scalar based on TIA, MAP, TENG, CKNOCK and RPM. The spark retard<br>
calculating module 302 determines the amount of spark retard based on the<br>
octane scalar and the engine ignition control module 304 generates a spark<br>
control signal based on the amount of spark retard.<br>
[0029] The cylinder air mass limit determining module 306<br>
determines the cylinder mass air limit based on the octane scalar and the<br>
engine RPM. The turbocharger control module 308 generates a boost control<br>
signal based on the cylinder air limit. More specifically, the waste gate 28 is<br>
actuated based on the boost control signal to limit the boost output of the<br>
turbocharger to the cylinder mass air limit.<br><br>

invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
