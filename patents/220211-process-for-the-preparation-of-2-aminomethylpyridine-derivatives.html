				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 2-aminomethylpyridine derivative which is useful as intermediate compound for .the preparation of pesticides, starting with benzophenone and 'glytine alkyl ester hydrochloride.<br>
Patent application WO 99/42447 discloses1 the preparation of 2-aminomethylpyridines starting from benzophenone glycine imine alkyl ester. This document does not disclose a method for the preparation of benzophenone gjycine imine alkyl ester.<br>
Certain methods for the preparation of benzophenone glycine imine alkyl ester have been reported in Journal ofPeptide Research (2000), 55(4), page 300-307. This article discloses the reaction of benzophenone imine with alkyl glycinate hydrochlbride to prepare benzophenone glycine imine alkyl ester. The use of benzophenone is not disclosed in that document. The use of benzophenone imine presents the.drawback in that it is expensive. Furthermore, this compound converts into the benzophenone compound during the preparation of 2-aminomethylpyridine compounds thus resulting in an additional step in the process to convert benzophenone into benzophenone imine before recycle, which is undesirable on a commercial plant.<br>
We have now found an alternative method to prepare 2-aminomethylpyridine derivatives which. overcomes these problems and which is applicable to industrial scale operation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 2-aminomethylpyridine derivative of general formula (I) or a salt thereof:<br>

During the preparation of PyGE.HCl from PyGI according to the present invention, benzophenone can be recovered and ready to be directly recycled for<br><br>
benzophenone glycine imine alkyl ester preparation. According to the present invention, benzophenone does not need to be recycled into benzophenone imine, avoiding an expensive additional step. Furthermore, the yield of product obtained by the process according to the present invention is greater than the yield achievable with the processes known from the prior art.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compound of general formula (I). Preferably, the different characteristics of compound of formula (I) may be chosen independently from each other as being:<br>

the man ordinary skilled in the art. Particularly, the mixture obtained following to<br>
step A may be cooled down and washed with water to dissolve trialkylamine base<br>
hydrochloride salt. The two liquid phases may then be separated. The bottom<br>
aqueous layer containing the trialkylamine base hydrochloride salt may be separated<br>
and treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide to recover trialkylamine base for recycle.<br>
The solvent layer which contains the BPGI and the excess of benzophenone may be<br>
dried by azeotropic distillation of the solvent and water. The dry solution of BPGI in<br>
solvent may then be ready for the coupling reaction with Py-z.<br>
On completion of step B, the aprotic polar solvent is distilled under vacuum<br>
for possible recycle. The mixture of PyGI, non polar solvent and excess dry<br>
inorganic base may be cooled down at about 20°C and then washed with water to<br>
separate the two phases. A bottom aqueous layer containing excess dry inorganic<br>
base may be discarded. The solution of PyGLin non polar solvent and the excess of<br>
benzophenone from the previous step may then be ready for the acidification reaction<br>
of the step C.	j<br>
On completion of the step C, two phases may be separated. The bottom aqueous phase containing PyGE.HCl which is ready for the decarboxylation step (step D), and a top non polar solvent phase containing benzophenone. The non polar solvent and benzophenone may be recovered for recycle to the BPGI preparation.<br>

The mixture was heated at 110-115°C at atmospheric pressure to give a good reflux in toluene. 97g (1.05 mole) of N,N-diisopropyl N-ethyl amine was added by pump over 4 hours. During the reaction, water was formed and was distilled off as water-toluene azeotrop. Water was decanted in the Dean and Stark seprator and toluene was returned to the reactor. Reaction was pursued for 1 hour after the end of the amine addition and completion of the reaction was monitored by liquid chromatography.<br>
When reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was cooled down to 20°C. The mixture was then washed with 33 5g of water and the 2 liquid phases were separated by decantation. The bottom aqueous phase containing all N,N-diisopropyl N-ethyl amine hydrochloride was kept for treatment by aqueous sodium hydroxide to recover N,N-diisopropyl N-ethyl amine for recycle.<br>
The upper toluen phase containing benzophenone glycine imine ethyl ester and the excess benzophenone was concentrated during which operation water was removed as an azeotrope with toluene. The dry solution, of benzophenone glycine imine ethyl ester in toluene was assayed by liquid chromatography : a 91% yield of benzophenone glycine imine ethyl ester was obtained with respect to glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride.<br><br>

Potassium carbonate was dried of water by refluxing in toluene and distilling off water-toluene azeotrop at a pot temperature of 110°C. 15Qg of toluene were removed.<br>
To the dry suspension of potassium carbonate, 4.75g (0.05 molar equivalent) of tetraethylarnmoniurn bromide, 310g of propionitrile and 380g (I molar equivalent of BPGI intermediate) of the previous solution of dry benzophenone glycine imine ethyl ester in toluene were added. The mixture was heated at reflux (105°C), and 99g (1 molar equivalent of benzophenone glycine imine ethyl ester intermediate) of 2,3-dichloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyridine was added by pump over 3 hours, maintaining reflux and separating the condensate in the Dean and Stark condensator, returning solvent to the reaction vessael and discarding water. The reaction completion was monitored by liquid chromatography. Reflux with water removal was continued for a further 3 hours after the end of the pyridine addition. Propionitrile was then distilled<br>
off under a reduced pressure of 300 mbar. The reaction mixture was cooled down to<br>
,* 20°C. 315g of water was added and the 2 liquid phases were separated. The bottom<br>
aqueous phase contains all the unreacted potassium carbonate and was discarded. The upper toluene phase of ethyl N-(diphenylmethylene)-2-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyl)glycinate was assayed by liquid chromatography. A yield bf 85% in ethyl N-(diphenylmethylene)-2-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyl)glycinate with respect to 2,3-dichloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyridine was obtained.<br>
