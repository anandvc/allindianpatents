				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition and to'a method of treatment,.in particular to a method for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially nora-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) (or Type 2 diabetes) and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus.<br>
Insulin secretagogues are compounds that promote increased secretion of insulin by the pancreatic beta cells.<br>
The sulphonylureas are well known examples of insulin secretagogues. The sulphonylureas act as hypoglycaemic agents and are used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Examples of sulphonylureas include glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide, glimepiride, tolazamide and tolbutamide,<br>
European Patent Application, Publication Number 0,306,228 relates to certain thiazolidinedione derivatives disclosed as having hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic activity. One particular thiazolidinedione disclosed in EP 0306228 is 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl)thiazoiidine-2,4-dione (hereinafter 'Compound (I)'), WO94/05659 discloses certain salts of Compound (I) including the maleate salt.<br>
Compound (I) is an example of a class of anti-hyperglycaemic agents known as 'insulin sensitisers'. In particular Compound (I) is a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser.<br>
European Patent Applications, Publication Numbers: 0008203, 0139421, 0032128,0428312,0489663,0155845,0257781, 0208420,0177353,0319189, 0332331, 0332332, 0528734,0508740; International Patent Application, Publication Numbers 92/18501, 93/02079,93/22445 and United States Patent Numbers 5104888 and 5478852, also disclose certain thiazolidinedione insulin sensitisers.<br>
Another series of compounds generally recognised as having insulin sensitiser activity are those typified by the compounds disclosed in International Patent Applications, Publication Numbers WO93/21166 and WO94/01420. These compounds are herein referred to as 'acyclic insulin sensitisers'. Other examples of acyclic insulin sensitisers are those disclosed in United States Patent Number 5232945 and International Patent Applications, Publication Numbers WO92/03425 and WO91/19702.<br>
Examples of other insulin sensitisers are those disclosed in European Patent Application, Publication Number 0533933, Japanese Patent Application Publication Number 05271204 and United States Patent Number 5264451.<br>
It is now surprisingly indicated that Compound (I) in combination with a sub maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue provides a particularly beneficial effect on glycaemic control, such combination is therefore particularly useful for the treatment<br>
of diabetes mellitus and conditions associated with diabetes. Lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue in the presence of a full dose of insulin sensitising agent also has the benefit of reducing the likelihood, frequency and/or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, said process comprising mixing a sub-maximal dose comprising 5-95 % of the appropriate non-combination dose of an insulin secretagogue of the kind such as herein described; from 1 to 99.9 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of the kind such as herein described and remaining in weight percentage equivalent to 2 to 12 mg of 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy] benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (Compound I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to obtain the said composition.<br>
The composition produced by the process of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a product obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of properties of the components thereof and is in fact a mixture having improved and unexpected properties.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 Diabetes, and conditions associated with diabetes in a mammal such as a human, which method comprises administering an effective non-toxic and pharrhaceutically acceptable amount of an insulin sensitiser and a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue, to a mammal in need thereof.<br>

It is also considered that the invention encompasses a method for reducing the likelihood, frequency and/or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes, which method comprises administering an effective non-toxic and pharniaceutically acceptable amount of an insulin sensitiser and a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I), together with an insulin secretagogue for use in reducing the likelihood, frequency and/or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus, wherein the dose of me insulin secretagogue is a sub-maximal dose.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides the use of an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I), and an insulin secretagogue for the manufacture of a composition for reducing the likelihood, frequency and/or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus, wherein the amount of the insulin secretagogue is sub-maximal.<br>
The method comprises either co-administration of the insulin sensitiser and<br>
the sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue or sequential administration thereof.<br>
Co-administration includes administration of a formulation that includes an insulin sensitiser and a sub-maximal amount of the insulin secretagogue or the essentially simultaneous administration of separate formulations of each agent. A suitable insulin sensitiser is a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser. A suitable thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser is Compound (I). Other suitable thiazolidinedione insulin sensitisers include (+) -5-[[4-[(3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2, 5, 7, 8-tetramethyl-2H-l-benzopyran-2-yl)methoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (or troglitazone), 5-[4-[(l-methylcyclohexyl)methoxy]benzyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or ciglitazone), 5-[4-[2-(5-ethylpyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]benzyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or pioglitazone) or 5-[(2-benzyl-2,3-dihydrobenzopyran)-5-ylmethyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or englitazone) Suitable insulin secretagogues include sulphonylureas. Suitable sulphonylureas include glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide, glimepiride, tolazamide and tolbutamide.<br>

Preferably, the method comprises the administration of 4 mg of Compound (I), especially when administered per day.<br>
Preferably, the method comprises the administration of 8 mg of Compound (I), especially when administered per day.<br>
It will be understood that the insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and the insulin secretagogue are each administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and solvates thereof, as appropriate. In certain instances herein<br>
the names used for the relevant insulin secretagogues may relate to a particular pharmaceutical form of the relevant active agent: It will be understood that all pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the active agent per se are encompassed by this invention, including pharmaceutically acceptable salted forms and pharmaceutically acceptable solvated forms.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salted forms of the insulin sensitisers, such as Compound (I), include those described in the above mentioned patents and patent applications such as in EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 for Compound (I).   A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salt for Compound (I) is a maleate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvated forms of the insulin sensitisers, such as Compound (I), include those described in the above mentioned patents and patent applications, such as in EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 for Compound (I), in particular hydrates.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the insulin secretagogue depend upon the particular compound used but include known pharmaceutically acceptable form of the particular compound chosen. Such derivatives are found or are referred to in standard reference texts such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein.)<br>
The insulin sensitisers, such as Compound (I) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable forms thereof, may be prepared using known methods, for example those disclosed in the above mentioned patents and patent applications, such as EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 for Compound (I). The disclosures of the above mentioned patents and patent applications, such as EP 0306228 and WO94/05659, are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Compound (I) may exist in one of several tautomeric forms, all of which are encompassed by the term Compound (I) as individual tautomeric forms or as mixtures thereof. Compound (I) contains a chiral carbon atom, and hence can exist in up to two stereoisomeric forms, the term Compound (I) encompasses all of these isomeric forms whether as individual isomers or as mixtures of isomers, including racemates.<br>
The insulin secretagogue of choice is prepared according to known methods, such methods are found or are referred to in standard reference texts, such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein.)<br>
When used herein the term 'sub-maximal amount' of an insulin secretagogue means an amount lower than (that is less than 100% and typically within the range of<br>
from 5-95% of, for example 75%, 80%, 90% or 95% of) the appropriate non-combination dose for the insulin secretagogue in question, as described or referred to in reference texts such as the British National Formulary (BNF), British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press). For example, for glibenclamide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is 15 mg daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of glibenclamide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically 1.5-12.5 mg daily. For a second example, for gliclazide, the maximum daily dose quoted in the BNF is 320 mg daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of gliclazide given together with an insulin sensitiser is 20-300 mg daily. For a third example, for glipizide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is typically 40 mg daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of glipizide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically 5-30 mg daily. For a fourth example, for tolazamide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is Ig daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of tolazamide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically 50-950 mg daily. For a fifth example, for tolbutamide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is 2g daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of tolbutamide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically lOOmgto 1.75g daily.<br>
When used herein the term 'conditions associated with diabetes' includes those conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself and complications associated with diabetes mellitus.<br>
'Conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself include hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, including acquired insulin resistance. Further conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself include hypertension and cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis and conditions associated with insulin resistance. Conditions associated with insulin resistance include polycystic ovarian syndrome and steroid induced insulin resistance and gestational diabetes.<br>
'Complications associated with diabetes mellitus' includes renal disease, especially renal disease associated with Type 2 diabetes, neuropathy and retinopathy.<br>
Renal diseases associated with Type 2 diabetes include nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal disease. Additional renal diseases associated with Type 2 diabetes include nephrotic syndrome.<br>
As used herein the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces both human and veterinary use: for example the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces a veterinarily acceptable compound.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, when reference is made herein to scalar amounts, including mg amounts, of Compound (I) in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, the<br>
scalar amount referred to is made in respect of Compound (I) per se: For example 2 mg of Compound (I) in the form of the maleate salt is that amount of maleate salt which contains 2 mg of Compound (I).<br>
Diabetes mellitus is preferably Type 2 diabetes. Suitably the insulin sensitiser is the first administered agent. In the present treatment the insulin sensitiser is administered at its normal, appropriate dose, for example Compound (I) is administered at a dose selected from 2-12mg per day, for example 1, 2,4 or 8 mg per day.<br>
Glycaemic control as referred to herein may be characterised using conventional methods, for example by measurement of a typically used index of glycaemic control such as fasting plasma glucose or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlc). Such indices are determined using standard methodology, for example those described in: Tuescher A, Richterich and P., Schweiz. med. Wschr. 101 (1971), 345 and 390 and Frank P., 'Monitoring the Diabetic Patent with Glycosolated Hemoglobin Measurements', Clinical Products 1988.<br>
In the method of the invention, the active medicaments are preferably administered in pharmaceutical composition form. As indicated above, such compositions can include both medicaments or one only of the medicaments.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and especially 2 to 12 mg thereof, a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
Such compositions may be prepared by admixing an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and especially 2 to 12 mg thereof, a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
Usually the compositions are adapted for oral administration. However, they may be adapted for other modes of administration, for example parenteral administration, sublingual or transdermal administration.<br>
The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, suppositories, reconstitutable powders, or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions.<br>
In order to obtain consistency of administration it is preferred that a composition of the invention is in the form of a unit dose.<br>
Unit dose presentation forms for oral administration may be tablets and capsules and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example<br>
starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate.<br>
The compositions are preferably in a unit dosage form in an amount appropriate for the relevant daily dosage.<br>
Suitable dosages for the insulin sensitisers include those disclosed in the abovementioned patents and patent applications.<br>
Suitable dosages, including unit dosages, of Compound (I) comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 mg of Compound (I).<br>
Particular dosages of Compound (I) are 2mg/day, 4mg/day, including 2mg twice per day, and 8 mg/day, including 4mg twice per day.<br>
In the treatment the medicaments may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day, but most preferably 1 or 2 times per day.<br>
The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are of course conventional in the art. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel, hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, and, depending on the concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, a preservative and buffering agent can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the Compound (I) is suspended in the vehicle instead of being<br>
dissolved, and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
Compositions may contain from 0.1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending upon the method of administration.<br>
Composition may, if desired, be in the form of a pack accompanied by written or printed instructions for use.<br>
The compositions are prepared and formulated according to conventional methods, such as those disclosed in standard reference texts, for example the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) and Harry's Cosmeticology (Leonard Hill Books) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein.)<br>

It is now surprisingly indicated that Compound (I) in combination with a sub maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue provides a particularly beneficial effect on glycaemic control, such combination is therefore particularly useful for the treatment<br>
of diabetes mellitus and conditions associated with diabetes. Lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue in the presence of a full dose of insulin sensitising agent also has the benefit of reducing the likelihood, frequency and/or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, said process comprising mixing a sub-maximal dose comprising 5-95 % of the appropriate non-combination dose of an insulin secretagogue of the kind such as herein described; from 1 to 99.9 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of the kind such as herein described and remaining in weight percentage equivalent to 2 to 12 mg of 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy] benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (Compound I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to obtain the said composition.<br>
The composition produced by the process of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a product obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of properties of the components thereof and is in fact a mixture having improved and unexpected properties.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 Diabetes, and conditions associated with diabetes in a mammal such as a human, which method comprises administering an effective non-toxic and pharrhaceutically acceptable amount of an insulin sensitiser and a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue, to a mammal in need thereof.<br>

It will be understood that the insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and the insulin secretagogue are each administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and solvates thereof, as appropriate. In certain instances herein<br>
the names used for the relevant insulin secretagogues may relate to a particular pharmaceutical form of the relevant active agent: It will be understood that all pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the active agent per se are encompassed by this invention, including pharmaceutically acceptable salted forms and pharmaceutically acceptable solvated forms.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salted forms of the insulin sensitisers, such as Compound (I), include those described in the above mentioned patents and patent applications such as in EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 for Compound (I).   A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salt for Compound (I) is a maleate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvated forms of the insulin sensitisers, such as Compound (I), include those described in the above mentioned patents and patent applications, such as in EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 for Compound (I), in particular hydrates.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the insulin secretagogue depend upon the particular compound used but include known pharmaceutically acceptable form of the particular compound chosen. Such derivatives are found or are referred to in standard reference texts such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein.)<br>
The insulin sensitisers, such as Compound (I) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable forms thereof, may be prepared using known methods, for example those disclosed in the above mentioned patents and patent applications, such as EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 for Compound (I). The disclosures of the above mentioned patents and patent applications, such as EP 0306228 and WO94/05659, are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Compound (I) may exist in one of several tautomeric forms, all of which are encompassed by the term Compound (I) as individual tautomeric forms or as mixtures thereof. Compound (I) contains a chiral carbon atom, and hence can exist in up to two stereoisomeric forms, the term Compound (I) encompasses all of these isomeric forms whether as individual isomers or as mixtures of isomers, including racemates.<br>
The insulin secretagogue of choice is prepared according to known methods, such methods are found or are referred to in standard reference texts, such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein.)<br>
When used herein the term 'sub-maximal amount' of an insulin secretagogue means an amount lower than (that is less than 100% and typically within the range of<br>
from 5-95% of, for example 75%, 80%, 90% or 95% of) the appropriate non-combination dose for the insulin secretagogue in question, as described or referred to in reference texts such as the British National Formulary (BNF), British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press). For example, for glibenclamide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is 15 mg daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of glibenclamide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically 1.5-12.5 mg daily. For a second example, for gliclazide, the maximum daily dose quoted in the BNF is 320 mg daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of gliclazide given together with an insulin sensitiser is 20-300 mg daily. For a third example, for glipizide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is typically 40 mg daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of glipizide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically 5-30 mg daily. For a fourth example, for tolazamide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is Ig daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of tolazamide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically 50-950 mg daily. For a fifth example, for tolbutamide, the maximum dose quoted in the BNF is 2g daily; thus a sub-maximal amount of tolbutamide given together with an insulin sensitiser is typically lOOmgto 1.75g daily.<br>
When used herein the term 'conditions associated with diabetes' includes those conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself and complications associated with diabetes mellitus.<br>
'Conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself include hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, including acquired insulin resistance. Further conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself include hypertension and cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis and conditions associated with insulin resistance. Conditions associated with insulin resistance include polycystic ovarian syndrome and steroid induced insulin resistance and gestational diabetes.<br>
'Complications associated with diabetes mellitus' includes renal disease, especially renal disease associated with Type 2 diabetes, neuropathy and retinopathy.<br>
Renal diseases associated with Type 2 diabetes include nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal disease. Additional renal diseases associated with Type 2 diabetes include nephrotic syndrome.<br>
As used herein the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces both human and veterinary use: for example the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces a veterinarily acceptable compound.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, when reference is made herein to scalar amounts, including mg amounts, of Compound (I) in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, the<br>
scalar amount referred to is made in respect of Compound (I) per se: For example 2 mg of Compound (I) in the form of the maleate salt is that amount of maleate salt which contains 2 mg of Compound (I).<br>
Diabetes mellitus is preferably Type 2 diabetes. Suitably the insulin sensitiser is the first administered agent. In the present treatment the insulin sensitiser is administered at its normal, appropriate dose, for example Compound (I) is administered at a dose selected from 2-12mg per day, for example 1, 2,4 or 8 mg per day.<br>
Glycaemic control as referred to herein may be characterised using conventional methods, for example by measurement of a typically used index of glycaemic control such as fasting plasma glucose or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlc). Such indices are determined using standard methodology, for example those described in: Tuescher A, Richterich and P., Schweiz. med. Wschr. 101 (1971), 345 and 390 and Frank P., 'Monitoring the Diabetic Patent with Glycosolated Hemoglobin Measurements', Clinical Products 1988.<br>
In the method of the invention, the active medicaments are preferably administered in pharmaceutical composition form. As indicated above, such compositions can include both medicaments or one only of the medicaments.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and especially 2 to 12 mg thereof, a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
Such compositions may be prepared by admixing an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and especially 2 to 12 mg thereof, a sub-maximal amount of an insulin secretagogue and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
Usually the compositions are adapted for oral administration. However, they may be adapted for other modes of administration, for example parenteral administration, sublingual or transdermal administration.<br>
The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, suppositories, reconstitutable powders, or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions.<br>
In order to obtain consistency of administration it is preferred that a composition of the invention is in the form of a unit dose.<br>
Unit dose presentation forms for oral administration may be tablets and capsules and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example<br>
starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate.<br>
The compositions are preferably in a unit dosage form in an amount appropriate for the relevant daily dosage.<br>
Suitable dosages for the insulin sensitisers include those disclosed in the abovementioned patents and patent applications.<br>
Suitable dosages, including unit dosages, of Compound (I) comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 mg of Compound (I).<br>
Particular dosages of Compound (I) are 2mg/day, 4mg/day, including 2mg twice per day, and 8 mg/day, including 4mg twice per day.<br>
In the treatment the medicaments may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day, but most preferably 1 or 2 times per day.<br>
The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are of course conventional in the art. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel, hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, and, depending on the concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, a preservative and buffering agent can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the Compound (I) is suspended in the vehicle instead of being<br>
dissolved, and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
Compositions may contain from 0.1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending upon the method of administration.<br>
Composition may, if desired, be in the form of a pack accompanied by written or printed instructions for use.<br>
The compositions are prepared and formulated according to conventional methods, such as those disclosed in standard reference texts, for example the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) and Harry's Cosmeticology (Leonard Hill Books) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein.)<br>
