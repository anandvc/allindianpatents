4.   DESCRIPTION<br>
SPINDLE SQUARING DEVICE AND METHOD OF OPERATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the necessity of establishing and measuring perpendicularity of the spindle of a vertical or horizontal machine tool as it relates to the table, work-holding or tool-holding surface of the machine.<br>
In the prior art manually establishing perpendicularity of a machine tool spindle to the workholding axis has traditionally been accomplished through labor intensive means. Perpendicularity must be established and quantifiably measured prior to setting up a manually operated spindle-type machine tool in order to verify the correct position of the workholding surface to the tool-holder. If the spindle is not aligned to the point at which .001 or less graduated dial indicator swept readings are identical at various points in the circumference the work-holding surface area, the quality of any work performed can be severely compromised or even rejected. Wozniak clearly describes the painstaking task of zeroing or squaring the head of a vertical milling machine in his patent (see U.S. Patent No 5253425, Wozniak, 10/1983, Description of Prior Art, Par. 4.)<br>
The drawbacks besides the obvious laboriousness of the prior art in squaring the spindle of a machine tool to its workholding surface are as follows: (a) The cumbersome nature of using a plurality of gauges and fixtures which must be assembled prior to use and dis-assembled after use; (b) The excessive amount of time needed to accomplish the task (as Wozniak states and as affirmed by other journeymen machinists 45 minutes to accomplish this using prior art method is considered average); (c) The physical discomfort using the prior art method which requires the machinist to hold one arm extended while repeatedly bending<br><br>
downward to observe the readings on the indicator for a prolonged amount of time; (d) The necessity of having to perform the task of squaring the head each and every time a new project is to be set up on the machine which may be numerous times each day or week depending on the schedule of work in the shop; (e) The back-up of work flow because of the lengthy nature of squaring the head of the spindle; (f) The necessity of having to utilize experienced machinists to perform a task which is, by its nature, time consuming and non-productive.<br>
The design of manually operated spindle machines such as milling machines also complicate the process of squaring the spindle. These machines have an "off-center" pivot making it troublesome for even an experienced machinist to square since it is difficult to judge the amount of adjustment required to bring the spindle of the machine into a perpendicular position because of the angular position of the pivot in relation to the head and table. Generally, the accepted rule of thumb is that the head of the machine should be perpendicular to the workholding surface within .0005 inches in 6 inches (0.013 mm in 15.24 cm). However, frequent and time consuming adjustments are required since even the slightest movement may extrapolate into major misalignments because of the off-center nature of the machine tool's pivot.<br>
Another variable which is difficult to negotiate in aligning the spindle to the workholding surface is the amount of play in the gears of the machine tool's spindle head. Since these machine tools have useful lives of well over ten years, normal usage causes the gears to wear. While this may not compromise the performance of the machine once it is properly squared and set-up, it does complicate the process of squaring the spindle head. At this point, the process of squaring the head can become more of an intuitive art than a mechanical one, with the machinist oftentimes guessing at the amount of alignment necessary to accommodate the unknown level of play in the gears.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a self-contained unit with features for permanently mounting measurement gauges eliminating the need for repetitious assembly and dis-assembly.<br>
Once assembled, the unit is self-calibrating.<br>
This device effectively eliminates the variable of "play" in the gears of the spindle head of the machine toot.<br>
The direction of adjustment which the machinist must make is readily known and a measurable reading can be taken without having to tram the device.<br>
The ease of use enables apprentice or entry-level employees to successfully tram or square the spindle head of a machine tool and its efficiency eliminates physical discomfort caused by the prior art.<br>
The amount of time to square a spindle head machine utilizing this device is far less than the prior art<br>
This device allows standard tramming operation for confirmational readings without the need of a secondary device.<br>
This device accurately squares the head of the spindle to any workholding surface or fixture that may be bolted to the table.<br>
This device accurately calibrates the spindle head to known angles or compound angles when used with a sine bar or gauge block.<br>
This device is lightweight and easily stored as a personal tool unlike the<br><br>
prior art tools which are cumbersome, bulky, and require multiple, unrelated components.<br>
To the inventors' knowledge comprised of over 60 years cumulative experience in this field, no such device such as the present invention exists.<br>

Figure 4 shows an alternative embodiment of a spindle squaring device incorporating a tilting mechanism.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Turning now more specifically to the drawings, Figure 2 shows a typical embodiment of the present invention with two proximity or dial indicators<br><br>
mounted into the body of the device. The spindle squaring device has a shaft [A], a case hardened metal body [B], and a reference surface plane [C] which is perpendicular to the shank [A], The present invention has a nesting feature [G] which holds proximity, dial, or other types of standard or custom gauges. The gauges are held in place by through holes [El which accommodate the indicator shanks, and by set screws or other fasteners received in threaded holes [F] on each end of the spindle squaring device body [B],<br>
The spindle squaring device of the present invention with dial indicators mounted into the body is first placed in an upright position on a known flat surface such as a granite surface plate. Both indicators are set so that the needles are pointing to "0." Once this is done, the spindle squaring device has been calibrated. It is thus a self- calibrating unit unlike the prior art.<br>
Figure 1 shows how the present invention is used to tram or square the head I of a vertical milling machine to its workholding table. The shank A (see Figure 2) of the spindle squaring device 3 is placed in the collet of the milling machine spindle 2. The spindle 2 is lowered until the spindle squaring device 3 makes measurable contact with the milling machine's table [Fig. 1, 4]. "Measurable contact" may be determined when needles on both indicators turn one full revolution. The machine is now ready to be squared on both the lateral and longitudinal axes (X and Y axes, respectively).<br>
With the spindle squaring device 3 secured as stated above, the machine can be adjusted on either axis first For illustrative purposes to explain use, the Y axis is adjusted first. As the adjusting screw 5 for the Y-axis is turned, the needles on the indicator dials of the spindle squaring device 3 will rotate. The adjustment screw 5 is turned left or right depending on the movement of the indicator needles until both needles point to identical numerical readings. When both indicator needles point to identical numerical reading, the spindle 2 is square to that axis.<br><br>
The Y-axis locking nuts 6 are tightened, securing the spindle 2 in this position. The spindle 2 is raised and the spindle squaring device 3 is rotated so that it is parallel to the "X" axis. The spindle squaring device 3 is lowered to the machine's table 4 and measurable contact is made with the table 4 of the machine. The X-axis adjustment screw 7 is turned causing the needles on the indicator dial to rotate. When both indicator needles are pointing to identical numerical<br>
readings, the spindle 2 is square on the X-axis. The X-axis locking nuts 8 are<br><br>
tightened, securing the position of the head 1 in relation to the table 4.<br>
Most machinists wish to verify their work. The spindle squaring device 3 of the present invention accommodates this without the necessity of introducing additional gauges, tools or removing the present invention. Verification of squareness is done by raising the spindle 2 and lowering it again so that the indicator tips [Fig 2, item H] make measurable contact (for example, about five gradations on the dial of the indicator or gauge) against the machine table 4. The spindle squaring device 3 is then slowly rotated 360 degrees. Measurements are observed from the readings of one indicator only. As a rule of thumb, indicator readings remaining within one thousandth of one inch (.001 in.) or .001 in TIR (one thousandth of one inch 'total indicator reading") (equal to 0025 mm) throughout the circular travel of the indicator represents an acceptable level of squareness for most workholding purposes. Readings are readily determined by observing the movement on the dial of one gauge. Once these readings are observed and verified, the machine is square and the spindle squaring device 3 is removed.<br>
Figure 3 shows how the spindle squaring device 3 may be used to set a spindle 2 of a machine tool at selected non-perpendicular angle to the table 4 of the machine. In the illustrated example this is done using a sine block assembly 10 of a known type comprising a sine block 12 and a stack of gage blocks 14. The top surface 16 of the sine block 12 is set at a desired angle a relative to the top of the table 4 by placing the required height of gage blocks 14 under one end of the sine<br><br>
block 12, in a known manner. The spindle 2 may then be set perpendicular to the top surface 16 of the sine block 12 using the procedure described above.<br>
Figure 4 shows an alternative embodiment of a spindle squaring device 13 which incorporates a tilting mechanism to enable a spindle of a machine, such as the mill shown in Figure 1, to a selected non-perpendicular angle with the table 4.<br>
The spindle squaring device 13 is substantially identical to the spindle squaring device described above, and includes components A'-G' corresponding the similar components A-G of the device 3. However, the shank A' is pivotable relative to the body B' so that its longitudinal axis can be set at a selected non-perpendicular angle to the reference surface C\ as shown in dashed lines in Figure 4. In the illustrated example the shank A1 is allowed to pivot by being attached to the body B' with a clamp bolt J. However, any known structure allowing adjustment of the shank A' relative to the body B' may be used. Once the desired angle of the shank A' to the body B' is set, the spindle squaring device 13 is inserted into the spindle 2 of a machine (see Figure 1) and the spindle 2 is then set at a desired angle relative to the top of the table 4 by setting the reference surface C' parallel to the table 4 using the procedure described above.<br>
The foregoing has described a spindle squaring device and method for its operation. While specific embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications thereto can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention and the best mode for practicing the invention are provided for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation, the invention being defined by the claims.<br><br><br><br>
