DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The construction of mats with coir and polypropylene, done on traditional<br>
handlooms make it a unique product in its segment.<br>
Now the invention will be described in detail with reference to the<br>
following description bearing the sequence of manufacturing process in<br>
order to obtain carpets and rugs having wool loop on jute base is described<br>
in detail.<br>
Manufacturing Process<br>
Materials Used<br>
1.	Coir<br>
2.	Polypropylene<br>
3.	Conventional Loom<br>
General Construction<br>
Reed Count - 70s<br>
Weft-16/10 cm<br>
Warp-12/10 cm The weaving operations are done in the conventional looms. Two separate<br><br>
beams are required for manufacturing the doormat. One beam is required for coir yarns and the other is required for polypropylene yarns. The coir warp threads and polypropylene threads are drawn through the respective mail eyes of the heald and then through the reed spaces. These are tied on the cloth roller. The ends are drawn through the fifth reed (three coir ends and one polypropylene ). This will be repeated throughout the full width of the doormat. These are then connected to the corresponding treadle according to the tie up and treadling plan. Treadles operate according to the treadling plan.<br>
The base weave of the doormat is 2\2 panama weave. For warp and weft coir yarn is used and for locking purpose of coir brush propylene yarn is used. The diameter of coir yarn is changed according to the treadling plan. This is a three shaft design. Two shafts are used for 2\2 weave and one is for polypropylene. To begin with two series boucle weave product is formed and then by pressing of third shaft polypropylene yarns are raised as a loop and the coir brush is inserted. It is locked by polypropylene yarns. When the first shaft is pulled down corresponding series of warp threads are raised. Weft is inserted by passing of shuttles and then by beating of sley these are fixed in a well manner. The second shaft is then pulled down. Next series of warp is raised and weft is inserted and sley is beaten. By pressing the third shaft polypropylene yarns are raised, coir brush is inserted below the polypropylene threads and it is locked. Again the first and second shafts are operated and two series of weft are inserted and thus a groove is formed<br><br>
in between the coir brushes. The polypropylene yarn is visible only in the<br>
portion of coir brushes.<br>
The first shaft and the second shaft are operated again and the weft is<br>
inserted. Then by pressing of third shaft polypropylene yarns are raised and<br>
coir brush is placed. Thus the operation is repeated and the doormat is<br>
manufactured.<br>
Preparation of Coir Brush<br>
Materials used<br>
Metal wires (galvanized) - 14-16mm<br>
14-16 mm galvanized metal wires are used for preparation of coir brush.<br>
One end of this wire is attached by a hook on a machine (wire twister) and<br>
the other end is connected to a hand rotating device. The fibres are arranged<br>
in a tray as per the height of the brush required. This tray is placed just<br>
beneath the wire and in between the hook and the rotating device. The<br>
twisted wires capture the fibre brazils during the rotation of the rotating<br>
device. Thus the coir brush is formed.<br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1. A method of manufacturing doormat having woven boot scrapper which comprises the following steps:<br>
a.	Two separate beams are required for manufacturing the doormat, one<br>
beam  is  required  for coir yarns  and the  other  is  required  for<br>
polypropylene yarns, the coir warp threads and polypropylene threads<br>
are drawn through the respective mail eyes of the heald and then<br>
through the read spaces, these are tied on the cloth roller, the ends are<br>
drawn through the fifth reed (three coir ends and one polypropylene),<br>
This will be repeated throughout the full width of the doormat, these<br>
are then connected to the corresponding treadle according to the tie up<br>
and treadling plan, treadles operate according to the tie up and<br>
treadling plan, treadles operate according to the treadling plan.<br>
b.	The base weave of the doormat is 2/2 panama weave, for warp and<br>
weft  coir yarn  is  used  and  for  locking purpose  of coir brush<br>
polypropylene yarn is used, the diameter of coir yarn is changed<br>
according to the treadling plan, this is a three- shaft design two shafts<br>
are used for 2/2 weave and one is for polypropylene, to begin with<br>
two series boucle weave product is formed and then by pressing of<br>
third shaft, polypropylene yarns are raised as a loop and the coir brush<br>
is inserted, it is locked by polypropylene yarns.<br>
c.	When the first shaft is pulled down corresponding series of warp<br>
threads are raised, weft is inserted by passing of shuttles and then by<br>
beating of sley these are fixed in a well manner, the second shaft is<br>
then pulled down, next series of warp is raised and weft is inserted<br>
and sley is beaten, by pressing the third shaft polypropylene yarns are<br>
raised, coir brush is inserted below the polypropylene threads and it is<br><br>
locked, again the first and the second shafts are operated and two series of weft is inserted and thus a groove is formed in between the coir brushes, the polypropylene yarn is visible only in the portion of coir brushes.<br>
d.	The first shaft and the second shaft are operated again and the weft is<br>
inserted, then by pressing of third shaft polypropylene yarns are raised<br>
and the coir brush is placed, thus the operation is repeated and the<br>
doormat is manufactured.<br>
e.	14-16 mm galvanized metal wires are used for preparation of coir<br>
brush, one end of this wire is attached by a hook on a machine (wire<br>
twister) and the other end is connected to a hand rotating device, the<br>
fibres are arranged in a tray as per the height of the brush required,<br>
this tray is placed just beneath the wire and in between the hook and<br>
the rotating device, the twisted wires capture the fibre brazils during<br>
the rotation of the rotating device, thus the coir brush is formed.<br>
2. A method of manufacturing doormat having woven boot scrapper as claimed in claim 1 wherein the ply and the diameter of the coir yarn and polypropylene yarn being changed according to the requirement of square metre weight of the product.<br></td>
