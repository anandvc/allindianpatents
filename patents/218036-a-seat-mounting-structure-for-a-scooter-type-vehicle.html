				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  a  seat  mounting structure for a scooter type vehicle.<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an improved seat mounting/luggage containing structure for a scooter type vehicle.<br>
[ Related Art]<br>
Fig. 37 is a view showing one example of a related art seat mounting structure for a scooter type vehicle.  A scooter type vehicle 200 has a large-sized luggage containing portion, disposed under a seat 201, for containing a helmet and the like.  The seat 201 is allowed to be opened so as to take a luggage in or out of the containing portion.<br>
The seat 201 can be tilted forward through a seat hinge provided at a front end thereof.<br>
A so-called double seat is elongated, in which a driver's seat (front seat) and a passenger's seat (rear seat) are continuously disposed in the longitudinal direction of a vehicular body. Such a double seat has an inconvenience that the seat, when being tilted, is possibly brought in contact with a handle cover 202 and/or a window screen 203 and also a seat hinge is applied with a large force in a state that the seat is tiled.<br>
To cope with such an inconvenience, there has been proposed an improved vehicle, for example, disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 5-25715 entitled "Scooter Type Small-sized Vehicle".  In this vehicle, a double seat is opened rightward through a seat hinge provided not at a front end but at a side end thereof.<br>
The structure described in the above document, as shown in Fig. 2 of the document, has two seat hinges (not indicated by reference numeral) mounted at a side end portion, and thereby it is suitable for a longer seat.<br>
Such a structure, however, has a problem.  In Fig. 2, the seat hinge is depicted on a very small scale and a lower hinge plate as a main member of the seat hinge does not appear.  It seems that the lower hinge plate is fixed on a right side surface of a body cover with a small screw or bolt, and if so, the hinge plate is exposed to the exterior, as a result of which the outer appearance of the vehicle is degraded.  In other words, the degraded appearance makes it difficult to adopt such a structure for a double seat.<br>
In view of the foregoing, generally, there is adopted a structure in which the lower hinge plate is fixed on an upper surface of an edge portion of a containing portion. The lower hinge plate, which needs to have a large rigidity, is formed into a relatively large sized rectangular shape. As will be described with reference to Fig. 8(a) , it is found that when such a large lower hinge plate is fixed on an upper surface of an edge portion of a containing portion, a supporting face of the hinge projects inward of the containing portion, to thereby make narrow an opening area of the containing portion.<br>
In each of the related art seats shown in Fig. 37 and Fig. 2 of the above document, to keep the seat at the full-open position not to be closed, the seat must be supported by the driver' hand, or by use of a suitable mechanical means, for example, a supporting rod or a full-open state holding mechanism.<br>
The supporting of the seat by the driver's hand is inconvenient because the driver cannot hold a luggage with both the hands to take it in or out of the containing portion.<br>
The supporting rod has a simple structure, but is disadvantageous in that it takes a lot of labor to set or reset the supporting rod.<br>
The full-open state holding mechanism, which is expected to be replaced with the above manners, generally has a complicated structure, and has another problem that a spring used for the mechanism is exposed. As a result, the related art mechanism is unsuitable for a small-sized and light-weight scooter type vehicle.<br>
A first object of the present invention is to provide (1) a seat mounting structure capable of solving disadvantages of the above-described related art front<br>
hinge structure and the side hinge structure, and (2) a full-open state holding mechanism suitable for a small-sized vehicle.<br>
On the other hand, a luggage containing structure for a scooter type vehicle has been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 3-21577 entitled "Luggage Containing Structure for Scooter Type Vehicle".<br>
In the above technique, as shown in Figs. 1 to 3 of the document, a luggage containing box 38 is disposed under a driver's seat 46 (the reference numeral is cited from the document, and the same shall apply hereinafter). An extending portion 38b is formed in front of the luggage containing box 38, and an upper opening of the luggage containing box 38 and an upper opening of the extending portion 38b are covered with a side cover 60, and also the upper opening of the containing box 38 is openably covered with the driver's seat 46.<br>
Incidentally, to give the driver a comfortable feeling of seating, it is undesirable that the driver's seat 46 has an excessively large or excessively small width. On the other hand, it is desirable that the luggage containing box 38 has a containing space being as large as possible.  In the luggage containing box 38 with the upper<br>
opening being blocked with the driver's seat 46, the width of the upper opening is affected by the width of the seat but the size of a bottom portion thereof is not limited thereto. The larger the width of the bottom portion, the larger the amount of luggages to be contained in the containing box. The luggage containing box 38 which is merely molded as a bottoming box, however, cannot be designed such that only the width of the bottom portion is enlarged, to keep good release of the box as a product from a molding die.  In view of the foregoing, it has been difficult to produce the luggage containing box 38 having a large containing space by molding.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide a technique capable of easily molding a containing box having a large containing space.<br>
{Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above first objects, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a seat mounting structure for a scooter type vehicle in which an upper opening of a containing box for containing a luggage such as a helmet is blocked with an openable seat,<br>
characterized in that a seat hinge is disposed on a side portion of said seat on a front side thereof; and a hinge shaft is tilted with respect to a longitudinal axis of «?. vehicular body and a crossing axis of the vehicular body in a plan view; whereby said seat is openable obliquely forward of the vehicular body.<br>
Since the seat hinge is disposed on a side portion of the seat on the front side thereof, there can be ensured a rear containing portion sufficiently broadened in the width direction of the vehicular body. When the seat is opened obliquely forward, the rear containing portion is opened to a large extent, so that a large luggage can be easily contained therein.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, the seat hinge is located at a vertex of a triangle and first and second seat locking mechanisms are located at the other vertexes of the triangle, whereby the seat is locked at two positions.<br>
Since the seat can be locked at two positions, the locking effect can be increased.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3 , the<br>
second seat locking mechanism is disposed at the center of the vehicular body and has a locking claw operated in the width direction of the vehicular body, and the first seat locking mechanism has a locking claw operated in the longitudinal direction of the vehicular body, so that the operational directions of the locking claws are substantially perpendicular to each other.<br>
The centering of the seat, which is performed using the second seat locking mechanism, allows a U-shaped metal fixture on the seat side to be certainly inserted in the first seal locking mechanism.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 4, the structure includes an interlocking-unlocking mechanism capable of unlocking the second seat locking mechanism in interlocking with the first seat locking mechanism when the first seat locking mechanism is unlocked.<br>
Since the first and second seat locking mechanisms can be unlocked simultaneously, the unlocking operation can be simplified.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 5, the seat hinge is composed of a lower hinge plate, and an upper<br>
hinge plate mounted on the lower hinge plate through the hinge shaft; the lower hinge plate has a pin hole for mounting the hinge shaft, a circular-arc groove centered d the pin hole, and a downward recessed pocket portion provided at an upper end of the circular-arc groove; and the upper hinge plate has a guide projection to be fitted in the circular-arc groove, and a vertically elongated pin slot allowing the hinge shaft to pass therethrough.<br>
The seat can be locked in an open state by making the guide projection of the upper hinge plate moved together with the seat fall in the pocket portion of the lower hinge plate on the vehicular body side when the seat is opened.<br>
In this way, the full-open state holding mechanism capable of holding the seat in a full-open state with an inexpensive and simple seat hinge is accomplished only by adding a pocket portion and a pin slot to the seat hinge equivalent to the conventional one.<br>
To achieve the above second object, according to an invention described in claim 6, there is provided a luggage containing structure for a scooter type vehicle in which an upper opening of a containing box for containing a luggage<br>
such as a helmet is blocked with an openable seat, characterized in that the containing box is composed of a box upper portion including only at a front half thereof a bottom portion and extending substantially along the overall length of the seat, and a bottoming box lower portion connected to a rear half of the box upper portion in such a manner as to cover a lower opening of the rear half, wherein a side wall of the front half of the box upper portion is tilted in a state being widened upward, and a side wall of the rear half of the box upper portion is tilted in a state being widened downward.<br>
In the box upper portion, the side wall of the front half including the bottom portion is tilted in the state being widened upward and the side wall of the rear half including the lower opening is tilted in the state being widened downward. As a result, the width of the upper opening of the front half can be made as large as possible along the width of the front half of the seat; and further the width of the upper opening of the rear half is made as large as possible along the width of the rear half of the seat and also the width of the lower portion of the rear half can be made larger than the width of the upper<br>
opening. Further, since the bottoming box lower portion is not limited to the width of the seat, it can be made larger accordingly to the width of the lower portion of the rear half of the box upper portion. Accordingly, a long-sized containing space substantially corresponding to the overall length of the seat can be ensured in the containing box, and a large-sized deep and broad space portion for containing a large luggage such as a helmet can be ensured in the rear half of the containing space. In particular, for a double seat, a longer-sized containing space can be easily ensured.<br>
Further, since the tilting (tilting direction) of the side wall of the box upper portion is changed in accordance with the position of the lower opening, molds for molding the containing box can be easily separated from each other, as a result of which the box upper portion can be easily molded.<br>
Since the width of the upper opening of the box upper portion is made as large as possible along the width of the seat, when the upper opening is blocked with the seat, the seat can be stably supported by the edge and its neighborhood of the upper opening.<br>
Thus, there can be provided the containing box<br>
capable of being easily molded, easily ensuring a large containing space, and stably supporting the seat.<br>
Additionally, since the containing box can be molded using injection-molds which ensure a high molding dimensional accuracy, the dimensional accuracy of the containing box can be increased.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 7 a rear fender is mounted on the containing box by holding one end of the rear fender between the box upper portion and the box lower portion.<br>
Since the containing box serves as a rear fender mounting member, it is not required for the body frame to be longer extended rearward for mounting the rear fender as in the conventional manner.  This is effective to shorten the body frame, and to reduce the weight thereof.<br>
Since the one end of the rear fender is held between the box upper portion and the box lower portion, the rear fender can be simply, positively mounted to the containing box.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 8, an<br>
edge portion of the upper opening at the front half is folded outward, and an edge portion of the upper opening at the rear half is folded inward.<br>
The box upper portion is configured that the edge of the upper opening at the position of the front half having the bottom portion is folded outward, and the edge of the upper opening at the rear half having the lower opening is folded inward. As a result, despite the edge of the upper opening is folded, two molds for molding the box upper portion can be easily separated from each other, and thereby the box upper portion can be easily molded.<br>
Therefore,  the  present  invention  relates  to  a  seat mounting structure for a scooter type vehicle wherein- an uppor-<br>
g" box for errrrtraining a luggage ouch— as,<br>
"Relmofe-- i-s- bl-&amp;eked w-i^bfe having an openable seat, characterized in that;<br>

a hinge shaft is tilted with respect to a longitudinal axis of a vehicular body and a crossing axis of the vehicular body in a plan view;<br>
whereby said seat is openable obliquely forward of the vehicular body.<br>

In an upper hinge plate 62, a front piece 62d and a rear piece 62e are respectively erected at front and rear ends of a top plate 62c having three bolt holes 62a (one piece, omitted in the figure). The front piece 62d has a pin hole 62f, and the rear piece 62e has a pin slot 62g and a guide projection 62h to be fitted in the circular-arc groove 61h. A folded spring latch 62i is formed integrally with the top plate 62c.  The pin slot 62g extends nearly toward the guide projection 62h.<br>
The seat hinge 60 is assembled by a manner of superimposing the front piece 62d and the rear piece 62e on the inner surfaces of the front wall 6 Id and the rear wall 61e respectively; allowing a hinge shaft 63 to pass through the pin holes 61f, 62f, 62g and 61g; crushing front and rear ends of the hinge shaft 63 for preventing slip-off of the hinge shaft 63 from the pin holes; and hanging a tension spring 64 between the hinge shaft 63 and the spring<br><br>
latch 62i.<br>
In other words, the seat hinge 60 is an assembly of the lower hinge plate 61, hinge shaft 63, upper hinge plate 62, and tension spring 64. [0031]<br>
Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) are sectional front views of the seat hinge of the present invention, illustrating the function thereof.  In addition, the bottom plate 61C of the lower hinge plate 61 is removably mounted on a hinge bracket 73 with a bolt, and the upper hinge plate 62 is removably mounted on the seat 16 side with a nut.<br>
Fig. 5(a) shows the seat hinge 60 in an<br>
intermediately opened state in which the guide projection 62h is in the midway of the circular-arc groove 61h.<br>
Fig. 5(b) shows the seat hinge 60 in a full-open state in which the guide projection 62h reaches an upper end of the circular-arc groove 61h and falls in the pocket portion 61i.  The hinge shaft 63 is positioned by the rear wall 61e on the back side in Fig. 5(b), and as the guide projection 62h falls in the pocket portion 61i, the rear piece 62e on the front side in Fig. 5(b) is shifted downward.  In this embodiment, in order not to obstruct the vertical movement of the rear piece 62e, the pin hole for<br>
the rear piece 62e is taken as the pin slot 62g.<br>
Specifically, the guide projection 62h, which has fallen in the pocket portion 61i, is applied with the pulling force of the tension spring 64 to which the dead weight of the seat is added, so that the guide projection 62 h is not simply slipped off from the pocket portion 61i even if it is applied with a horizontal force, as a result of which the seat 16 is kept in the full -open state.<br>
Fig. 6 is a view showing the full-open state of the seat of the present invention. The seat 16 is kept in the state shown in the figure, and in such a state, a luggage is taken in or out of the containing portion as shown by an arrow "1".<br>
As described with reference to Fig. 5(b), since the guide projection 62h falls in the pocket portion 61i by the pulling force of the tension spring 64 to which the dead weight of the seat is added, the tension spring 64 does not need to have a large tension strength, that is, no need to have a large size. While the cross-sectional relationship between the front wall 6 Id and the front piece 62d on the front side is not shown in Fig. 6, the tension spring 64 is disposed behind the front piece 62d, and thereby the outer<br>
appearance is not obstructed by the presence of the tension spring 64.<br>
In this way, a desired full-open state holding mechanism can be accomplished only by adding the pocket portion 61i and the pin slot 62g to the seat hinge equivalent to the conventional one. Such a mechanism allows the seat 16 to be kept in the full-open state using the seat hinge 60 having the inexpensive and simple structure.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view of a packing for the seat according to the present invention. A packing 57 for the seat includes a base portion 57a mounted on a lower surface of the seat 16, and a lip-like packing portion 57b extending downward from the base portion 57a. The packing portion 57b is a hollow seal member tilted outward from the seat 16.  The seal member is made from an elastic material such as rubber.<br>
A seal face Sir of the box upper portion 51 is formed into a complicated shape along an edge of the upper opening and also it has a large peripheral length.  On the other hand, the packing portion 57b is a lip-like packing tilted outward from the seat 16, and thereby it is easily<br>
elastically deformed. As a result, the sealing performance of the packing 57 for the seat 16 is high.<br>
Figs. 8 (a) and 8(b) are illustrative views of the seat of this embodiment in comparison with the related art seat.<br>
Fig. 8 (a) shows the related art right-open seat indicated by reference numeral 205 in which a distance LL between the center CL in the width direction of the vehicular body and each seat hinge 206 is relatively large.<br>
Fig. 8{b) shows the inventive obliquely- open seat 16 in which a distance L between the center CL in the width direction of the vehicular body and the seat hinge 60 is small.<br>
A seat opening moment is expressed by an equation of (weight of seat X distance L or LL).  Accordingly, the inventive seat 16 can be opened with a moment smaller than that of the related art seat.<br>
Figs. 9 (a) and 9(b) are also illustrative views of the seat of this embodiment in comparison with the related art seat.<br>
Fig. 9 (a) shows the related art right-open seat 205<br>
in which two pieces of the seat hinges 206 disposed on the front and rear sides largely project on the center CL side in the width direction of the vehicular body, and thereby a containing portion 207 is slightly narrow. Such a structure allows an elongated luggage to be contained therein, but it does not allow a large-sized broad luggage to be contained therein without difficulty.<br>
Fig. 9(b) shows the inventive obliquely-open seat 16 in which when the seat 16 is opened, the rear containing portion 5IB is opened to a large extent while the front containing portion 51A is opened to a slight extent, and in this embodiment, the front containing portion 51A is made shallow and the rear containing portion 5IB is made deep. As a result, the front containing portion 51A can be used to contain a small-sized luggage and the rear containing portion 51B can be used to contain a large-sized luggage.  In the inventive seat shown in Fig. 9(b), the capacity for containing a large-sized broad luggage is larger than that of the related art seat shown in Fig. 9(a). [0036]<br>
Fig. 10 is a side view of the body frame according to the present invention, showing a state in which the<br>
containing box 50 is mounted to the body frame 2 from top, and the seat 16 is placed thereon. Specifically, the containing box 50 as the containing portion is vertically divided into the box upper portion 51 and the box lower portion 52 at upper positions of rear frame portions 2a and 2b of the body frame 2.<br>
Further, as shown in this figure, a portal stay 72 is mounted on the rear frame portions 2a and 2b of the body frame 2 through brackets 71.<br>
Fig. 11 is a plan view of the body frame according to the present invention. The body frame 2 has the right and left rear frame portions (seat rails) 2a and 2b extending rearward in a fork shape. Rear ends of the rear frame portions 2a and 2b are connected to each other by means of a cross member 2c.<br>
The portal stay 72 includes right and left legs 72a and a rectangular bridge plate 72b provided on the legs 72a.  The rear grip 43 and the rear cover 30 shown in Fig. 1 are mounted on the bridge plate 72b.  Further, right and left two pieces 72c project from a front edge of the bridge plate 72b.  The second seat locking mechanism 67 is mounted on the pieces 72c.<br>
A hinge bracket 73 and a first box mounting bracket 75 are fixed on the right rear frame portion 2a, and a first seat catcher bracket 74 and a second box mounting bracket 76 are fixed on the left rear frame portion 2b. The hinge bracket 73 is a member for bolting the seat hinge 60; the first seat catcher bracket 74 is a member for mounting the first seat locking mechanism 66; and the first and second box mounting brackets 75 and 76 are members for mounting the rear portion of the containing box 50.<br>
Further, as shown in this figure, assuming that the hinge bracket 73 is located at a vertex of a triangle T, the first and second seat locking mechanisms 66 and 67 are located at the other vertexes of the triangle T. The first U-shaped metal fixture 58 (see Fig. 2) of the seat 16 can be smoothly inserted in the first seat locking mechanism 66 by centering (positioning in the width direction of the vehicular body) the seat (not shown) using the second seat locking mechanism 67 disposed at the center CL in the width direction of the vehicular body. 70039^]<br>
Fig. 12 is a front view of the first seat locking mechanism of the present invention. The first seat locking<br><br>
mechanism 110 includes a housing 102 having a U-shaped groove 101; the locking claw 104 rotatably mounted on the housing 102 through a pin 103; a tension spring 105 biasing the locking claw 104 in the unlocking direction; and a junction arm 108 rotatably mounted on the housing 102 through a pin 106.  The shapes of the locking claw 104 and the junction arm 108 will be described with reference to the following figure.<br>
Here, a structure is adopted in which the luggage box 50 is placed and bolted on the first seat locking mechanism 100 bolted on a first seat catcher bracket 392 provided on the body frame 2. [0040]<br>
Figs. 13(a) and 13(b) are views illustrating the function of the first seat locking mechanism of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13(a), the locking claw 104 includes a shorter upper claw 109 and a longer lower claw 110 disposed with a bay-like space put therebetween.  The junction arm 108 has a lower end to which a rear end of the first wire 135 is mounted and an upper end to which a leading end of the second wire 136 is mounted, and it also has a projection 111 and a recess 112 in the vicinity of<br>
the pin 106. The tension spring 105 is hung between the locking claw 104 and the junction arm 108 such that the locking claw 104 is rotated clockwise and the junction arm 108 is rotated counterclockwise.<br>
Fig. 13 (a) shows the locking state in which the U-shaped metal fixture 58 is latched to the upper claw 109 of the locking claw 104.  When the junction arm 108 is rotated clockwise by the first wire 135 in such a state, the projection 111 is descended and is released from the lower claw 110.  Since the locking claw 104 is usually biased to be rotated clockwise by the tension spring 105, the lower claw 110 is ascended along the recess 112.<br>
Fig. 13 (b) shows the unlocking state of the first seat locking mechanism.  The locking claw 104 is largely rotated clockwise and the upper claw 109 is removed from the U-shaped groove 101.  The unlocking state is thus obtained.<br>
At the same time, the junction arm 108, which has been rotated clockwise, pulls the second wire 136. r QQ42 ]<br>
Fig. 14 is a rear view of the second seat locking mechanism of the present invention. The second seat<br>
locking mechanism 120 includes a housing 122 having a U-shaped groove 121; the locking claw 124 rotatably mounted on the housing 122 through a pin 123; and a toxsion spring 125 biasing the locking claw 124 in the locking direction.<br>
When being pulled rightward in the figure by the second wire 136, the locking claw 124 is rotated in the unlocking direction.<br>
The second seat locking mechanism 120 has an extremely simple structure, and also has an extremely simple mounting configuration in which the mechanism is mounted on the pieces 389 of the portal stay 386 with bolts 126.<br>
By inserting and twisting the key 131 in the cylinder 133 shown in Fig. 2, the first seat locking mechanism 100 is unlocked through the first wire 135 and the second seat locking mechanism 120 is unlocked through the wire 136 in an interlocking manner.  Thus, the seat locking mechanisms 100 and 120 disposed at two positions can be unlocked simultaneously.<br>

Fig. 16 is an exploded side view of the containing box 50 according to the present invention.  The box upper portion 51 has a lower opening 5 Id opened over the entire rear half 51B. The lower surface of the rear half 51B is formed in such a shape that a front portion of the lower opening 51d is recessed upward in a side view, to form a recessed portion 51e. An upper projecting portion 52d of the box lower portion 52 is inserted in the recessed portion 51e, and an upper portion 52e is formed over the entire upper projecting portion 52d.<br>
Fig. 17 is an exploded perspective view of a rear fender mounting structure of the containing box according to the present invention. A rear fender 49 is mounted to<br>
the containing box 50 by holding an upper end (one end) of the rear fender 49 between rear portions of the box upper portion 51 and the box lower portion 52. Each of the rear fender 49, box upper portion 51, and box lower portion 52 is formed of a resin by molding.<br>
Specifically, an upper flange 45a of the rear fender 49 is held between a flange (lower mating face 5 In) of the box upper portion 51 and a flange (upper mating face 52g) of the box lower portion 52, and co-fastened therewith by means of self -tapping screws 81 and bolts 82.  The upper flange 45a has in an upper surface thereof a sealing groove 45b and also has in a lower surface thereof a sealing broad projecting rib 45c.  The sealing groove 45b is fitted around a sealing projecting rib 51t of the box upper portion 51, and the sealing projecting rib 45c is fitted in a sealing groove 52i (broad groove portion 52k) of the box lower portion 52.<br>
Fig. 18 is a plan view of the containing box according to the present invention. The box lower portion 52 is superimposed from bottom to the box upper portion 51, and is connected thereto at peripheral portions thereof by 13 pieces of self-tapping screws 81.<br><br>
The box upper portion 51 has in the bottom portion thereof an engine checking hole (carburetor checking hole) 51f which is usually blocked with a lid 83. The lid 83 is bolted on the box upper portion 51.<br>
The box upper portion 51 is also configured that a rear upper portion overhung rearward from the cross member 2c of the body frame 2 is bolted on a bridge plate 72b shown by an imaginary line.  For such bolting of the box upper portion 51, the box upper portion 51 has bolt holes 51g at positions corresponding to those of bolts 72d of the bridge plate 72 shown in Fig. 11.<br>
The box lower portion 52 has a battery mounting portion 52 f formed on a right side portion of the bottom portion 52a. The battery box mounting structure will be described with reference to Fig. 33 and later drawings.<br>
In Fig. 18, reference numeral 51h indicates a bolt hole used for bolting the box upper portion 51 to the first seat catcher bracket 74 together with the first locking mechanism 66 shown in Fig. 11.<br>
Fig. 19 is a sectional view taken on line 19-19 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure of the front half<br>
portion of the containing box 50.  In the front half 51A of the box upper portion 51, side walls 51i tiltingly rise from the bottom portion 51b in such a manner as to be widened upward, and leg portions 51 j and 51k fall from the tilting walls 51i. The leg portions 51 j and 51k are placed on the right and left rear frame portions 2a and 2b of the body frame 2, respectively.<br>
Fig. 20 is a sectional view taken on line 20-20 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure of the engine checking hole 51f of the box upper portion 51 and its neighborhood.  In the front half 51A of the box upper portion 51, the projecting portion 51a extending from the right side wall 51i is mounted, by means of a bolt 84, on the hinge bracket 73 together with the lower hinge plate 61. A leg portion 51m falling from the left side wall 51i is placed on the left rear frame portion 2b.<br>
Fig. 21 is a sectional view taken on line 21-21 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure of a left side portion of the box upper portion 51.<br>
Fig. 22 is a sectional view taken on line 22-22 of<br>
Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure of a rear half portion of the containing box 50. The containing box 50 is assembled by mating the bottoming box lower portion 52 to the box upper portion 51 in such a manner as to cover the lower opening 5 Id, superimposing the lower mating face 5 In to the upper mating face 52g, and mounting the box lower and upper portions 51 and 52 on the first and second box mounting brackets 75 and 76 by means of the bolts 84.  In the rear half 51B of the box upper portion 51, the side walls 51i are tilted in such a manner as to be widened downward .<br>
The battery mounting portion 52f is a chamber extending downward from the bottom portion 52a of the box lower portion 52 and having an opening 52h on the right side.<br>
Fig. 23 is a sectional view taken on line 23-23 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure in which the box upper portion 51 is superimposed on the box lower portion 52 and connected thereto with the self-tapping screw 81.<br>
Fig. 24 is a sectional view taken on line 24-24 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure in which the box<br>
upper portion 51, the box lower portion 52, and the upper flange 45a of the rear fender 45 are superimposed and connected to each other with the self-tapping screw 81.<br>
Fig. 25 is a sectional view taken on line 25-25 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure in which the box upper portion 51 is superimposed on the box lower portion 52 and connected thereto by means of a screw 85a and a nut 85b with a clip.<br>
Fig. 26 is a sectional view taken on line 26-26 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure in which a lower end of the box upper portion 51 is fitted in the sealing groove of the box lower portion 52.<br>
Fig. 27 is a sectional view taken on line 27-27 of Fig. 18, showing a sectional structure in which a flange 51u of the box upper portion 51 is superimposed on a flange 52 j of the box lower portion 52 and is connected thereto with the self-tapping screw 81.<br>
Figs. 28 (a) to 28(c) are views showing the upper opening of the box upper portion and its neighborhood<br>
according to the present invention, wherein Fig. 28(a) is a schematic plan view of the box upper portion; Fig. 28(b) is a sectional view taken on line b-b of Fig. 28(a); and Fig. 28(c) is a sectional view taken on line c-c of Fig. 28(a).<br>
Referring to Fig. 28(a), in the box upper portion 51, each of edges 51p and 51q of the upper portion 51c is folded. Specifically, in the box upper portion 51, the edge 51p of the front half 51A having the bottom portion 51b is folded outward as shown in Fig. 28(b), and the edge 51g of the rear half 5IB having the lower opening 5Id is folded inward as shown in Fig. 28(c). An upper surface of each of the outward and inward folded portions (edges) 51p and 51q is taken as a seal face 51r as shown in Figs. 28(b) and 28(c). A packing guide portion 51s extends upward from the seal face 51r along an edge of the upper opening 51c. In addition, there is no packing guide portion 51s in a range C of Fig. 28(a).<br>
The packing portion 57b shown in Fig. 6 is brought in contact with the seal face 51r for sealing.<br>
The folded edge of the upper opening 51c is effective to increase rigidities of the edge and its neighborhood.  This makes it possible to suppress deformation of the seal face 51r as much as possible, and<br>
hence to increase the sealing effect.<br>
Figs. 29(a) to 29(d) are viev.»s showing a configuration of the lower mating face of the box upper portion and its neighborhood according to the present invention, wherein Fig. 29 (a) is a schematic plan view of the box upper portion; Fig. 29 (b) is a sectional view taken on line b-b of Fig. 29 (a); Fig. 29 (c) is a sectional view taken on line c-c of Fig. 29{a); and Fig. 29(d) is a sectional view taken on line d-d of Fig. 29 (a).<br>
As shown in Fig. 29 (a), in the box upper portion 51, the sealing projecting rib 51t, which extends downward, is formed substantially over the entire periphery of the edge of the lower opening 51d, that is, on the lower mating face 51n shown in Fig. 22. In addition, there is no sealing projecting rib 51t at the positions of the two flanges 51u.  Fig. 29 (b) shows a sectional shape of the sealing projecting rib 51t.  Fig. 29(c) shows a sectional shape of the sealing projecting rib 51t which is formed of the lower end of the folded edge portion of the lower opening 51d.  Fig. 29 (d) shows a sectional shape of the flange 51u.<br>
Fig. 30(a) to 30(d) are views showing a configuration of the upper mating face of the box lower portion and its neighborhood according to the present invention, wherein Fig. 30 (a) is a schematic plan view of the box lower portion; Fig. 30 (b) is a sectional view taken on line b-b of Fig. 30(a); Fig. 30(c) is a sectional view taken on line c-c of Fig. 30(a); and Fig. 30(d) is a sectional view taken on line d-d of Fig. 30(a).  As shown in Fig. 30(a), in the box lower portion 52, the sealing groove 52i, which extends downward, is formed substantially over the entire periphery of the edge of the upper opening 52e, that is, in the upper mating face 52g shown in Fig. 22.  In addition, there is no sealing groove 52i at the positions of the two flanges 52 j.  In addition, a portion of the sealing groove 52i at the rear portion of the box lower portion 52 is taken as the broad groove portion 52k (see Fig. 17).  Figs. 30(b) and 30(c) show sectional shapes of the sealing groove 52i. Fig. 30 (d) shows a sectional shape of the flange 52 j.<br>
Fig. 31 is a front sectional view taken on line 31-31 of Fig. 30, showing the upper mating face 52g of the box lower portion 52 and its neighborhood. As shown in Fig.<br>
25, the upper mating face 52g of the box lower portion 52 has a stepped shape, and the sealing groove 52i is formed in a stepped shape corresponding to that cf the upper mating face 52g.<br>
Fig. 32 is a partial perspective view seen along the direction of an arrow 32 of Fig. 30, showing a state in which the sealing groove 52i at a front right corner (a right side portion of the front portion, based on the driver's viewing direction) of the box lower portion 52 is formed in a stepped shape.<br>
The sealing groove 52i, which is elongated in the longitudinal direction, is connected to a broad groove portion 52m extending toward the center CL in the width direction of the vehicular body. The broad groove portion 52m is connected to a taper groove portion 52n which is tapered down and extends downward, and the lower end of the taper groove portion 52n is connected to a narrow width groove portion 52p extending toward the center CL in the width direction of the vehicular body.<br>
Since the taper groove portion 52n is formed into a taper-down shape extending downward, two molds for molding the box lower portion 52 can be easily separated from each<br><br>
other. This allows the box lower portion 52 to be easily molded.<br>
In the box lower portion 52, a portion of the upper mating face 52g at the front left corner is also formed in a stepped shape, and a portion of the sealing groove 52i at the front left corner is formed in a stepped shape corresponding to that of the upper mating face 52g. With respect to the sealing groove 52i, the groove portion at the front left corner has the same shape as that of the above-described groove portion at the front right corner, that is, it includes the broad groove portion 52m, taper groove portion 52n, and narrow width groove portion 52p, explanation of which is omitted.<br>
The sealing projecting rib 5It formed on the lower mating face 51n of the box upper portion 51 has, of course, a shape corresponding to that of the sealing groove 52i. [OOCG]<br>
As is apparent from the above description, when the upper mating face 52g of the box lower portion 52 is superimposed on the lower mating face 5In of the box upper portion 51, the sealing projecting rib 51t is fitted in the sealing groove 52i, to form a labyrinth structure shown in<br>
Figs. 22 to 25. A space between both the mating faces can be thus sealed without use of a separate member such as a packing, resulting in the reduction of cost. Also, although the mating faces have complicated shapes, that is, the stepped shapes, the space between both these mating faces can be sealed at a high sealing performance by use of the labyrinth structure.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 24, a space between the upper and lower mating faces with respect to the upper flange 45a of the rear fender is sealed at a high sealing performance by use of the labyrinth structure.<br>
Next, the battery box mounting structure will be described.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 22, the battery mounting portion 52 f is provided for mounting a battery box described later using the opening 52h opened on the right side of the battery mounting portion 52f.<br>
Fig. 33 is a sectional view of the battery box mounting structure according to the present invention, showing a sectional front structure in which a battery box 87 is mounted on the box lower portion 52.<br>
The battery box 87 is opened toward the center CL in the width direction of the vehicular body. As shown in the figure, a flange 87a extending upward from the upper side portion of the battery box 87 is bolted on the first box mounting portion 75, and a fitting groove 87b horizontally opened from the lower portion of the opening edge of the battery box 87 is inserted around an edge portion of the opening 52h.  The width of the battery box 87 is set at such a value as to allow part of the contained battery 88 to be inserted from a side wall 52q of the box lower portion 52 into the battery mounting portion 52f. As a result, since the projecting dimension of the battery box 87 from the side wall 52q of the box lower portion 52 is small, the size of the entire scooter can be reduced.<br>
As shown in Fig. 33, a space S upward open is formed between the battery mounting portion 52 f and the battery 88, and a battery cover 89 having an insertion structure is mounted in the space S.  Specifically, the battery cover 89 is inserted from top into the battery mounting portion 52f and mounted to the box lower portion 52 with a bolt 91A, to thereby cover the interior of the battery mounting portion 52f in such a manner as to prevent<br>
the battery 88 from being slipped off from the battery mounting portion 52f. The battery cover 89 has an upward open containing recessed portion 89a for containing a tool and the like.<br>

007_i_<br>
While description has been made by example of the elongated seat 16 called the double seat in the above embodiment, the present invention can be of course applied to a single seat only for the driver. <br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention having the above<br>
configuration exhibits the following effects:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
According to the invention described in claim 1 , there is provided a seat mounting structure for a scooter type vehicle in which an upper opening of a containing box for containing a luggage such as a helmet is blocked with an openable seat, characterized in that a seat hinge is disposed on a side portion of the seat on a front side thereof; and a hinge shaft is tilted with respect to a longitudinal axis of a vehicular body and a crossing axis of the vehicular body in a plan view; whereby the seat is openable obliquely forward of the vehicular body.<br>
Since the seat hinge is disposed on a side portion of the seat on the front side thereof, there can be ensured a rear containing portion sufficiently broadened in the width direction of the vehicular body. When the seat is opened obliquely forward, the rear containing portion is opened to a large extent, so that a large luggage can be easily contained therein.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, the seat hinge is located at a vertex of a triangle and first and second seat locking mechanisms are located at the other vertexes of the triangle, whereby the seat is locked<br>
at two positions.<br>
Since the seat can be locked at two positions, the locking effect can be increased.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, the second seat locking mechanism is disposed at the center of the vehicular body and has a locking claw operated in the width direction of the vehicular body, and the first seat locking mechanism has a locking claw operated in the longitudinal direction of the vehicular body, so that the operational directions of the locking claws are substantially perpendicular to each other.<br>
The centering of the seat, which is performed using the second seat locking mechanism, allows a U-shaped metal fixture on the seat side to be certainly inserted in the first seal locking mechanism.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, the structure includes an interlocking-unlocking mechanism capable of unlocking the second seat locking mechanism in interlocking with the first seat locking mechanism when the first seat locking mechanism is unlocked.<br>
Since the first and second seat locking mechanisms<br>
can be unlocked simultaneously, the unlocking operation can be simplified.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 5, the seat hinge is composed of a lower hinge plate, and an upper hinge plate mounted on the lower hinge plate through the hinge shaft; the lower hinge plate has a pin hole for mounting the hinge shaft, a circular-arc groove centered at the pin hole, and a downward recessed pocket portion provided at an upper end of the circular-arc groove; and the upper hinge plate has a guide projection to be fitted in the circular-arc groove, and a vertically elongated pin slot allowing the hinge shaft to pass therethrough.<br>
The seat can be locked in an open state by making the guide projection of the upper hinge plate moved together with the seat fall in the pocket portion of the lower hinge plate on the vehicular body side when the seat is opened.<br>
In this way, the full-open state holding mechanism capable of holding the seat in a full -open state with an inexpensive and simple seat hinge is accomplished only by adding a pocket portion and a pin slot to the seat hinge<br>
equivalent to the conventional one.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 6, there is provided a luggage containing structure for a scooter type vehicle in which an upper opening of a containing box for containing a luggage such as a helmet is blocked with an openable seat, characterized in that the containing box comprises a box upper portion including only at a front half thereof a bottom portion and extending substantially along the overall length of the seat, and a bottoming box lower portion connected to a rear half of the box upper portion in such a manner as to cover a lower opening of the rear half, wherein a side wall of the front half of the box upper portion is tilted in a state being widened upward, and a side wall of the rear half of the box upper portion is tilted in a state being widened downward.<br>
In the box upper portion, the side wall of the front half including the bottom portion is tilted in the state being widened upward and the side wall of the rear half including the lower opening is tilted in the state being widened downward. As a result, the width of the upper opening of the front half can be made as large as<br>
possible along the width of the front half of the seat; and further the width of the upper opening of the rear half is made as large as possible along the width of the rear half of the seat and also the width of the lower portion of the rear half can be made larger than the width of the upper opening.  Further, since the bottoming box lower portion is not limited to the width of the seat, it can be made larger accordingly to the width of the lower portion of the rear half of the box upper portion. Accordingly, a long-sized containing space substantially corresponding to the overall length of the seat can be ensured in the containing box, and a large-sized deep and broad space portion for containing a large luggage such as a helmet can be ensured in the rear half of the containing space.  In particular, for a double seat, a longer-sized containing space can be easily ensured.<br>
Further, since the tilting (tilting direction) of the side wall of the box upper portion is changed in accordance with the position of the lower opening, molds for molding the containing box can be easily separated from each other, as a result of which the box upper portion can be easily molded.<br>
Since the width of the upper opening of the box<br>
upper portion is made as large as possible along the width of the seat, when the upper opening is blocked with the seat, the seat can be stably supported by the edge and its neighborhood of the upper opening.<br>
Thus, there can be provided the containing box capable of being easily molded, easily ensuring a large containing space, and stably supporting the seat.<br>
Additionally, since the containing box can be molded using injection-molds which ensure a high molding dimensional accuracy, the dimensional accuracy of the containing box can be increased.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 7, a rear fender is mounted on the containing box by holding one end of the rear fender between the box upper portion and the box lower portion.<br>
Since the containing box serves as a rear fender mounting member, it is not required for the body frame to be longer extended rearward for mounting the rear fender as in the conventional manner.  This is effective to shorten the body frame, and to reduce the weight thereof.<br>
Since the one end of the rear fender is held<br>
between the box upper portion and the box lower portion, the rear fender can be simply, positively mounted to the containing box.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 8, an edge portion of the upper opening at the front half is folded outward, and an edge portion of the upper opening at the rear half is folded inward.<br>
The box upper portion is configured that the edge of the upper opening at the position of the front half having the bottom portion is folded outward, and the edge of the upper opening at the rear half having the lower opening is folded inward. As a result, despite the edge of the upper opening is folded, two molds for molding the box upper portion can be easily separated from each other, and thereby the box upper portion can be easily molded.<br>
