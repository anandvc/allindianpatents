DESCRIPTION<br>
TONER, AND DEVELOPER, DEVELOPING APPARATUS, PROCESS<br>
CARTRIDGE, IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS AND IMAGE FORMING<br>
METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a toner used for image formation<br>
by an electrostatic copying process such as copying machine, facsimile .<br>
and printer, as well as a developer comprising the toner, a developing<br>
apparatus,  a process cartridge, an image forming apparatus and an<br>
image forming method using the developer.<br>
Background Art<br>
An image forming method by electrographic process generally<br>
comprises: a charging process of charging by electric discharge the<br>
surface of a photoconductor which is an image bearing member,' an<br>
exposing process of forming a latent electrostatic image by exposing the<br>
charged photoconductor surface; a developing process of developing a<br>
toner image by supplying a toner to the latent electrostatic image formed<br>
on the photoconductor surface; a transferring process of transferring the<br>
toner image on the photoconductor surface onto the surface of a<br>
transferring member," a fixing process of fixing the toner image on the<br>
surface of the transferring member; and a cleaning process of removing<br>
the toner left on the surface of the image bearing member after the<br>
transferring process.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
Recently, in association with the broad propagation of color image<br>
forming apparatuses using the electrographic process and easily<br>
available digitized images, it is desired to make an image to be printed<br>
with higher definition. While higher resolution and gradation of images<br>
are being examined, regarding the improvement of a toner which<br>
visualizes a latent image, it has been studied to further ensphere the<br>
toner and reduce the particle size in order to form an image with high<br>
definition. Since the toners produced by pulverizing methods have<br>
limited properties thereof, polymerized toners produced by a suspension<br>
polymerization method, an emulsification polymerization method and a<br>
dispersion polymerization method capable of ensphering the particles<br>
and reducing the particle size are being employed.<br>
A toner with high sphericity is easily affected by electric lines of<br>
force in an electrostatic development method, and a toner image is<br>
closely developed along the electric lines of force of the latent<br>
electrostatic image on the photoconductor. The toner is easily arranged<br>
densely and uniformly, and the reproducibility a thin line becomes high<br>
when a latent image of fine dots is reproduced. In addition, since the<br>
toner has high particulate flowability due to its smooth surface and small<br>
adhesive strength among the toner particles or between the toner<br>
particles and the photoconductor; Therefore, the electrostatic<br>
transferring method has high transfer ability since the toner is easily<br>
affected by the electric lines of force, and the transfer is easily performed<br>
faithfully along the electric lines of force.<br>
However, the toner with high degree of sphericity has a smaller<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
surface area compared to an amorphous toner of the same particle<br>
diameter. This means that the surface available for factional charge by<br>
contact with a fractional charging member such as a magnetic carrier and<br>
developer regulation member is small. When, the toner is spherical, it<br>
easily slides on the surface of the above frictional charging member.<br>
Thus, the charging speed and the charging level are low. Therefore, more<br>
than a certain amount of a charge controller is required on the surface of<br>
the toner.<br>
Additionally, the smaller the toner particle diameter is for<br>
enhancing the reproducibility of a fine dot, the more the frictional charge<br>
property is reduced. Thus, it is a critical issue to simultaneously satisfy<br>
the charge property, developing property and transfer property.<br>
Regarding the spherical toner and the toner having a small<br>
particle diameter, various proposals to control their shapes have been<br>
made. Shape Factors SF-1 and SF-2 are often used as indicators<br>
representing the toner shape. The shape factor SF-1 is an indicator that<br>
represents the degree of roundness of a toner particle, and SF-2 is an<br>
indicator that represents the degree of convexoconcave of a toner particle.<br>
For example, Patent Literatures 1 to 3 attempt to control the shape of<br>
the particles by defining the ranges of the shape factors SF-1 and/or SF-2<br>
in order to simultaneously satisfy the charge property, developing<br>
property, transfer property, or cleaning property even with a spherical<br>
toner and a toner having small particle diameter.<br>
Patent Literature 4 describes a technology which defines the<br>
range of the shape factor of toner particles as well as a surface area ratio<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
represented by the following formula:<br>
Surface area ratio = p xD50p x S<br>
where p is a specific gravity (g/cm3) of the toner particles, D50p is a<br>
number average particle diameter (m) of the toner particles, and S is<br>
BET specific surface area (m2/g) of the toner particles.<br>
This surface area ratio is a different measure that represents the<br>
degree of convexoconcave of the toner particle from the foregoing shape<br>
factor. When the value of the surface area ratio exceeds a given range,<br>
the degree of convexoconcave on the surface of the toner particle becomes<br>
large. This allows an external additive added externally with time to the<br>
toner particles to enter in the depressing portions of the toner particles,<br>
and thus it becomes impossible to maintain the charge property and the<br>
transfer property over a long period of time.<br>
In Patent Literature 5, the toner surface is defined by an atomic<br>
force microscope. However, the degree of convexoconcave in Patent<br>
Literature 5, i.e., the degree of surface roughness (Ra), the degree of<br>
standard deviation of Ra (RSM) and the number of protective portions<br>
having difference of elevation of 20 nm or more, is not sufficient for a<br>
cleaning system with higher durability and stability. It was desired that<br>
more enhanced cleaning property, by further increasing the degree of<br>
convexoconcave in the toner shape reduced cleaning blade abrasion and<br>
hence improved the image stability in printing with time.<br>
The technology described in Patent Literature 5 is characterized<br>
by having a fine convexoconcave on the toner surface for the purpose of<br>
particularly improving the charge property, developing property and<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
transfer property. However, the irregular shape property (large<br>
convexoconcave) of the toner as a whole is not sufficient since fine<br>
particles such as organosilica are not suitably used for changing the<br>
shape. Therefore, it was absolutely insufficient for solving a problem of<br>
an stability of the cleaning over time.<br>
As described above, despite many attempts to enhance the charge<br>
property, developing property, transfer property or cleaning property by<br>
controlling the shapes of the toner particles, a toner having sufficiently<br>
satisfactory performance and the related technology have not yet been<br>
provided because all the attempts only have a rough view of the surface<br>
shape of the toner particle, and none of them grasps the microscopic state<br>
of concavoconvex for simultaneously satisfying the charge property,<br>
developing property, transfer property and cleaning stability with time.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Toner)<br>
The toner of the present invention comprises toner base particles<br>
comprising a binder resin and a colorant, and further contains other<br>
ingredients as needed.<br>
A toner base particles has a surface roughness (Ra) of 18 nm to 50<br>
nm and a standard deviation (RMS) of the surface roughness of 0.5 nm to<br>
9.9 nm; the surface roughness Ra is large, and the standard deviation<br>
RMS of the surface roughness is small (convexo-concave cycle is short).<br>
Since the toner base particles of conventional toners obtained by<br>
suspension polymerization and dissolution suspension are spherical and<br>
thus have almost no convexoconcave. Therefore, Ra is reduced (region<br>
where RMS is small or large) and is out of the above range.<br>
Conventional emulsification aggregation toners have small Ra and large<br>
RMS, which are out of this range even if they are modified in shape.<br>
Furthermore, conventional toners obtained by pulverization has large Ra<br>
and large RMS, which are also out of this range.<br>
Surface characteristics of the toner base particles can be analyzed,<br>
for example, using an atomic force microscope (AFM). However, a probe<br>
top enters into a concave portion of the concavoconvex when the shape<br>
having larger surface concavoconvex is measured,, and thus the<br>
concavoconvex can not be correctly measured in some cases. Therefore, it<br>
is preferable to use a 3D-SEM (3D-scanning electron microscope, field<br>
emission electron beam three dimensional roughness analyzer) capable of<br>
measuring without contact.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
A measurement principle is sometimes different depending on<br>
manufacturing corporations, and for example, ERA-8900FE,<br>
manufactured by Elionix Co., Ltd., equips multiple, or four, secondary<br>
electron detectors with different placement, and it quantitatively detects<br>
the amount of secondary electron signals which enter the detector and<br>
calculates the angle of gradient for X-Y of a sample. A three dimensional<br>
shape can be measured with this apparatus without severe damage to<br>
the sample because the shape is evaluated using secondary electron. In<br>
addition, a horizontal direction can be measured with high resolution. In<br>
the present embodiment, the surface characteristics of the toner base<br>
particles were defined by measuring the toner particle surface having 4<br>
mm square.<br>
The surface roughness Ra is defined by a three dimensional<br>
average roughness for a center plane (i.e., the plane which divides the<br>
concavo-convex volume equally in above and below this plane) and is<br>
represented by the following formula I:<br><br>
where Zcp represents the Z value of the center plane, Zi represents the Z<br>
value in each data point, and N represents the number of the data points.<br>
The standard deviation RMS of the surface roughness is the<br>
standard deviation of Z values of all data points and is represented by<br>
the following formula II:<br><br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
where Zave represents the mean of all Z values, Zi represents the Z value<br>
of each data point, and N represents the number of the data points.<br>
The surface roughness (Ra) is defined by an average length of the<br>
highest 5 points from peaks and the lowest 5 points from bottoms<br>
selected for each reference length.<br>
The surface roughness (Ra) is an average surface roughness and<br>
is identical when the volumes of the concavoconvex made by the center<br>
plane and the surface shape are equal even whether the particles have a<br>
rough concavoconvex or a fine concavoconvex. Meanwhile, the value of<br>
the standard deviation (RMS) becomes large when the fine<br>
concavoconvex is dominant. Thus, the standard deviation can represent<br>
roughness and fineness of the concavoconvex.<br>
Regarding the toner of the present invention, the surface<br>
-roughness (Ra) of the toner base particles is 18 nm to 50 nm, and more<br>
preferably 18 nm to 30 nm. When the surface roughness is less than 18<br>
nm, the concavo-convex size on the surface of the toner base particle is<br>
excessively small, a cleaning ability is reduced. A blade wearing property<br>
after long use (after printing several hundred thousand sheets), largely<br>
contributed by the reduction of the fine cleaning ability, is reduced, which<br>
is not preferable. Also, since the frictional charging state is reduced, the<br>
charge performance under an environment at high temperature and high<br>
humidity or at low temperature and low humidity is reduced, which is<br>
not preferable. When the surface roughness (Ra) exceeds 50 nm, the<br>
concavo-convex sizes on the surface of the toner base particles are large,<br>
which reduces the flowability of the toner as well as the charge property<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
and the transfer property. The sharpness of the image is also reduced.<br>
The standard deviation (RMS) of the surface roughness of the<br>
toner base particles is 0.5 nm to 9.9 run, and preferably 2 nm to 8 nm. In<br>
particular, the concavo-convex cycle is very important when the<br>
microscopic cleaning ability involved in the cleaning blade wearing<br>
property is discussed. A cleaning effect can not be sufficiently exerted<br>
when the cycle is excessively large or small. By having a concavo-convex<br>
cycle in this range, a dam effect can be formed on the blade with being<br>
capable of preventing toner tumble in the cleaning blade while assuring<br>
the toner transfer property. A trace amount of the toner scraping<br>
through is reduced; and consequently the blade wearing caused by<br>
thereof can be prevented. When the standard deviation (RMS) of the<br>
surface roughness in the blade is less than 0.5 nm, the surface<br>
concavoconvex of the toner base particles becomes excessively rough, and<br>
the favorable factional charging by the contact with the frictional<br>
charging member can not be performed. Furthermore, the transfer<br>
property as well as the fine cleaning ability is reduced, which increases<br>
in the amount of the toner left upon transferring. When RMS exceeds<br>
9.9 nm, the surface concavoconvex of the toner base particles becomes<br>
dense, the flowability of the toner, is reduced, and a tumble prevention<br>
effect of the toner is reduced as well, which consequently reduces the<br>
cleaning ability.<br>
The surface roughness (Rz) of the toner base particles is<br>
preferably 30 nm to 200 nm, and more preferably 50 nm to 150 nm in<br>
terms of cleaning stability and charge stability.   The surface roughness<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
(Rz) is an indicator which represents the peak height of a concavoconvex<br>
after noise rejection. The larger Rz is, the larger the degree, of<br>
concavoconvex is. The smaller Rz is, the smaller the degree of<br>
concavoconvex is. When Rz is less than 30 nm, the degree of<br>
concavoconvex is excessively small, reducing the cleaning ability as well<br>
as the blade wearing property after printing several hundred thousand<br>
sheets, which is not preferable. Rz exceeding 200 run tends not only to<br>
impair the toner charge stability but also to cause cracks in the convex<br>
portions, which then easily causes the increase of fine powder ingredients<br>
in a developing machine after long use for printing, which is not<br>
preferable.<br>
The toner of the present invention is toner base particles having<br>
the above-mentioned surface characteristics, and it is more preferable<br>
that inorganic particulates are internally added to the toner. Internal<br>
addition of the inorganic particulates not only enables the formation of<br>
the concavoconvex derived from the concavoconvex of the inorganic<br>
particulates on the toner surface but also is effective, particularly when<br>
the toner produced in a process comprising granulation in a liquid<br>
medium, for the following reason. A polymer toner production comprises<br>
a desolvation process, where the resin generally shrinks. Meanwhile, ,<br>
hardness around the inorganic particulates is enhanced in particular<br>
when the internally added inorganic particulates are present in the<br>
vicinity of the surface, which causes a difference in the hardness from<br>
that at the portion without organic particulates. Thus, a discrepancy in<br>
the shrinking speed occurs, and consequently a deep concavoconvex<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
having a dimple shape is formed on the toner surface.<br>
Regarding the enhancement of the flowability, the charge<br>
property and the environmental charge property, it is preferable to<br>
externally add the inorganic particulates by combining those of equal or<br>
different types.<br>
Examples of the inorganic particulates includes silica,<br>
organosilica sol, alumina, titanium oxide, barium titanate, magnesium<br>
titanate, calcium titanate, strontium titanate, zinc oxide, tin oxide,<br>
quartz sand, clay, mica, wollastonite, diatomaceous earth, chromium<br>
oxide, cerium oxide, colcothar, antimony trioxi.de, magnesium oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide, barium sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate,<br>
silicon carbide and silicon nitride. By using any of them individually or<br>
some inorganic particulates in combination, it is possible to enhance the<br>
shape, the flowability, developing property and the charge property of the<br>
toner base particles.<br>
The primary particle diameter of this inorganic particulate is<br>
preferably 5 x 10'3 um to 2 fan, and more preferably 5 x 10"3 um to 0.5 (am.<br>
It is preferable that the specific surface area by BET method is 20 m2/g to<br>
500 m2/g. The percentage of this inorganic p articulate to be used is<br>
preferably 0.01 % to 5 % by mass, and in particular preferably 0.01 % to<br>
2.0 % by mass.<br>
It is preferable that an average circularity of the toner base<br>
particles is 0.93 to 1.00 in the light of obtaining high image quality<br>
because an excellent dot reproducibility and favorable transfer property<br>
may be obtained with the above circularity.   The toner having such a<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
high average circularity easily slides on the surface of the frictional<br>
charging member such as magnetic carrier, and it is disadvantageous in<br>
terms of charging speed and charging level. However, by having the<br>
surface characteristics of the toner base particle of the present invention,<br>
it is possible to obtain a toner with sufficient frictional charge property<br>
as well as excellent developing property and transfer property.<br>
When the average circularity is less than 0.93, i.e. the shape of<br>
the toner is far from spherical, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient transfer<br>
property or a high quality image with no dust. Such amorphous particles<br>
have many contact points with medium having a smooth surface such as<br>
photoconductor. Also, such particles have larger Van der Waals1 force and<br>
image force than relatively spherical particles since charges are<br>
concentrated at the top of a prominence; hence its adhesive force is also<br>
larger. Thus, in a toner where amorphous particles and spherical<br>
particles are mixed, the spherical particles selectively move to cause<br>
image missing in a text section and a line section in an electrostatic<br>
transferring process. The remaining toner must be removed for the<br>
subsequent developing process, and there are problems such as a<br>
cleaning apparatus is required and that a toner yield (percentage of the<br>
toner used for the image formation) is low.<br>
The average circularity of a toner is a value obtained by optically<br>
detecting the particles and dividing the circumference of the projection<br>
area by the circumference of a circle having the same area as the<br>
projection area. Specifically, the particle is measured using a flow mode<br>
particle    image    analyzer    (FPIA-2000,    manufactured    by    Sysmex<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
Corporation). In a given vessel, 100 mL to 150 mL of water from which<br>
solid impurities have been previously removed is placed. As a dispersant,<br>
0.1 mL to 0.5 mL of a surfactant is added, and about 0.1 g to 9.5 g of a<br>
sample to be measured is further added. A suspension in which the<br>
sample has been dispersed is treated in an ultrasonic dispersion<br>
apparatus for about 1 to 3 minutes to make the concentration of the<br>
dispersion 3,000 to 10,000 particles/uL, and the shape and the<br>
distribution of the toner are measured.<br>
The toner preferably has a volume average particle diameter (Dv)<br>
of 2.0 urn to 6.0 urn and a ratio (Dv/Dn) of the volume average particle<br>
diameter (Dv) to a number average particle diameter (Dn) of 1.00 to 1.40.<br>
More suitably, the volume average particle diameter is 3.0 jim to 6.0 urn,<br>
and Dv/Dn is 1.00 to 1.15. Such a toner has excellent heat resistant<br>
storage stability, low-temperature fixing property and hot offset<br>
resistance. Especially, an excellent luster property of the image is<br>
obtained when used with a full-color copying machine.<br>
In general, the smaller the particle diameter of the toner is, the<br>
more advantageous it is for obtaining the image with high resolution and<br>
high quality. However, in contrast, it is disadvantageous in terms of the<br>
transfer property and the cleaning ability. When the volume average<br>
particle diameter is below the range of the present invention, the toner is<br>
fused to the surface of the magnetic carrier in a prolonged stirring in the<br>
developing apparatus to reduce the charge performance of the magnetic<br>
carrier with a two-component developer. In the case of one-component<br>
developer, filming of the toner to the developing roller and fusion of the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
toner to a member such as blade for thin filming of the toner tend to<br>
occur.<br>
These phenomena are largely dependent on the content of fine<br>
powder. In particular, the content of the particles with a particle<br>
diameter of 3 mm or less exceed 10 % works against the adhesion to the<br>
magnetic carrier and the high-level charge stability.<br>
Conversely, when the volume average particle diameter of the<br>
toner is above the range of the present invention, it becomes difficult to<br>
obtain an image with high resolution and high quality. In addition, the<br>
variation of the particle diameter in the toner often becomes large when<br>
the toner in the developer is balanced.<br>
When Dv/Dn exceeds 1.40, a charge distribution becomes wide,<br>
and resolution is reduced, which is not preferable.<br>
The average particle diameter and particle size distribution of a<br>
toner can be measured using Coulter Counter TA-II or Coulter Multisizer<br>
(both are manufactured by Coulter). In the present invention,<br>
measurements were performed using Coulter Counter TA-II connected<br>
with an interface that output a number distribution and a volume<br>
distribution (manufactured by The Institute of Japanese Union of<br>
Scientists &amp; Engineers) and . with PC9801 personal computer<br>
(manufactured by NEC Corporation).<br>
It is also preferable that the ratio of the surface roughness (Ra) to<br>
the volume average particle diameter (Dv), i.e. Ra (nm)/Dv (mm), is 0.3 to<br>
10.0. When the above ratio is less than 0.3, the toner base particles<br>
easily slide on the surface of the frictional charging member since the<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
degree of concavoconvex is small for the particle diameter of the toner<br>
base particle. Therefore, the charge property is reduced, and the<br>
cleaning ability is also reduced. Meanwhile, when the above ratio<br>
exceeds 10.0, the toner base particles are strongly rubbed with the<br>
frictional charging member and easily spent since the degree of<br>
concavoconvex is large for the particle diameter of the toner base particle.<br>
Thus, the charge performance is reduced.<br>
Preferably, the toner base particles have a shape coefficient SF-2<br>
of 100 to 140 and the ratio of the surface roughness (Ra) thereto, i.e. Ra<br>
(nm)/SF-2, of 0.008 to 0.500.<br>
The shape coefficient SF-2 indicates the degree of concavoconvex<br>
of the toner shape as shown in Formula III below. SF-2 is a value<br>
obtained by dividing the square of the peripheral length (PERI) of a<br>
shape obtained by projecting the toner to a two dimensional plane by the<br>
area (AREA) of the shape, and multiplying 100/471:<br><br>
where PERI represents the peripheral length of the shape obtained by<br>
projecting the toner base particle to a two dimensional plane; AREA<br>
represents the area of the shape obtained by projecting the toner base<br>
particle to the two dimensional plane.<br>
When the value of SF-2 is 100, no macroscopic concavoconvex is<br>
present in the toner shape. The larger the value of SF-2 is, the more the<br>
concavoconvex in the toner shape becomes remarkable.<br>
The value of SF-2 can be calculated by observing and saving the<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
images of one hundred randomly selected toner particles by a scanning<br>
electron microscope (FE-SEM S-4800, manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.)<br>
and by analyzing these images by an image analyzer (LUSEX AP, Nireco<br>
Corporation). The analysis is more on the macroscopic concavoconvex of<br>
the toner base particle compared to the surface roughness Ra.<br>
When the value of SF'2 exceeds 140, the toner is scattered on the<br>
image, and the image quality is reduced. Thus, the value of SF-2 is<br>
preferably in the range of 100 to 140.<br>
It is preferable that the ratio of the surface roughness Ra, which<br>
represents the fineness of the surface concavoconvex of the toner base<br>
particle, to the shape coefficient SF-2, which represents the macroscopic<br>
concavoconvex on the shape of the toner base particle, i.e. Ra (nm)/SF-2,<br>
is in the range of 0.008 to 0.500. The toner that has the ratio within this<br>
range has suitably fine concavoconvex on the toner base particles, and<br>
thus the frictional charge property is favorable. In addition, the toner is<br>
excellent in developing property and transfer property since the shape of<br>
the toner base particle is nearly spherical, and the image with high<br>
quality can be provided.<br>
The toner of the present invention can be produced by<br>
granulating in a liquid medium. The toner of the present invention can<br>
be obtained more suitably by dissolving/dispersing a toner material<br>
containing inorganic particulates using an organic solvent, ' and<br>
granulating in an aqueous medium followed by desolvation.<br>
The toner produced by dry pulverization method has an<br>
amorphous shape, and moreover it tends to have a wide particle diameter<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
distribution. Therefore, it is preferable to produce by granulating in the<br>
liquid medium in order to narrow the circularity distribution and the<br>
particle diameter distribution and to narrow the charge distribution of<br>
the toner. Specifically, it is possible to use a granulation method by<br>
forming liquid drops in a liquid medium using a method such as<br>
suspension polymerization, emulsification polymerization and dispersion<br>
polymerization.<br>
To control the surface roughness Ra of the toner base particles, it<br>
is easy and preferable to use a method in which a different resin from the<br>
toner binding resin is adhered to the surface of the toner base particles.<br>
Regarding the different resin from the toner binding resin, it is possible<br>
to use a resin capable of forming an aqueous dispersion, and the resin<br>
may be a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin. Examples of the<br>
resin includes vinyl based resins, polyurethane resins, epoxy resins,<br>
polyester resins, polyamide resins, polyimide resins, silicon based resins,<br>
phenol resins, melamine resins, urea resins, aniline resins, ionomer<br>
resins, and. polycarbonate resins. The resin may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more.<br>
Among them, the vinyl based resins, the polyurethane resins, the<br>
epoxy resins and the polyester resins, and combinations thereof are<br>
preferable in respect that the aqueous dispersion member of fine<br>
spherical resin particles are easily obtained. For example, the vinyl<br>
based resins include polymers obtained by homopolymerization or<br>
copolymerization of vinyl based monomers, e.g., resins such as styrene-<br>
(meth)acrylic   acid   ester   copolymers,   styrene-butadiene   copolymers,<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
(meth) acrylic acid-acrylic acid ester copolymers, styrene-acrylonitrile<br>
copolymers, styrene-maleic acid ardiydrate copolymers and styrene-<br>
(meth)acrylic acid copolymers.<br>
When a toner composition, in which the above resin component is<br>
dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent is dispersed in an aqueous<br>
medium, the resin component adheres as particulates to peripheries of oil<br>
drops present to prevent the coalescence of the oil drops, and the oil<br>
drops having uniform particle diameter are produced. This phenomenon<br>
contributes to stabilization of the dispersion. The surface roughness Ra<br>
of the toner base particles can be controlled by controlling the amount of<br>
the resin component to be added and the particle diameter of the resin<br>
particulates to be formed.<br>
A method of adding a releasing agent in the toner may be given<br>
as a means to prevent the hot offset of the toner, which is a problem in<br>
the fixing process of the image forming process. The releasing agent<br>
comprised in the toner appears on the toner surface to develop a<br>
releasing property from a fixing member in association with deformation<br>
of the toner by receiving heat and pressure upon fixing. It is preferable<br>
that such releasing agent is enclosed without being exposed on the<br>
surface of the toner base particles because the wax exposed on the<br>
surface adheres to the surface of the frictional discharging member such<br>
as magnetic carrier to reduce the frictional charge property of the toner<br>
and exhibits an aggregation property to reduce the flowability of the<br>
toner.<br>
Furthermore, the use of the method for adhering the foregoing<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
resin particulates onto the surface of the toner base particles enables the<br>
releasing agent enclosed in the toner base particles to bleed only upon<br>
fixing, and the defects such as reduction of the toner charge property can<br>
be resolved in addition to the control of the surface roughness.<br>
Regarding the releasing agent, a wax having a low melting point<br>
of 50 °C to 120 °C works effectively between a fixing roller and a toner<br>
boundary surface as the releasing agent in the dispersion with the binder<br>
resin, which is effective for a high-temperature offset without an<br>
application of a releasing agent such as oil on the fixing roller. Such wax<br>
components include the following. Examples of waxes include plant<br>
based waxes such as carnauba wax, cotton wax, tree wax and rice wax;<br>
animal based waxes such as bee wax and lanolin; mineral based waxes<br>
such as ozokerite and selsyn; and petroleum based waxes such as<br>
paraffin, microcrystalline and petrolatum. In addition to these natural<br>
waxes, synthetic hydrocarbon waxes such as Fischer-Tropsch waxes and<br>
polyethylene waxes, and synthetic waxes such as ester, ketone and ether<br>
are included. Furthermore, it is possible to use fatty acid amide such as<br>
12-hydroxystearic acid amide, stearic acid amide, phthalic acid<br>
anhydrate imide and chlorinated hydrocarbon, and crystalline polymers<br>
having a long alkyl group in a side chain such as homopolymers and<br>
copolymers (e.g., copolymer of n-stearyl acrylate-ethyl methacrylate) of<br>
polyn-stearyl methacrylate, polyn-lauryl methacrylate which" are<br>
crystalline polymer resins having low molecular weights.<br>
The toner of the present invention is a toner obtained by<br>
dispersing in an aqueous medium a toner material, in which at least<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
polyester prepolymer having a functional group comprising a nitrogen<br>
atom, polyester, a colorant and a releasing agent are dispersed in an<br>
organic solvent and by performing a Crosslin king reaction and/or an<br>
extension reaction. Materials that compose the toner and suitable<br>
methods for production are described below.<br>
(Polyester)<br>
Polyester   is   obtained   by   polymerizing   and   condensing   a<br>
polyvalent alcohol compound and a polyvalent carboxylic acid compound.<br>
Examples of a polyvalent alcohol (PO) includes a divalent alcohol<br>
(DIO) and an trivalent or highervalent alcohol (TO). DIO alone or a<br>
mixture of DIO with a small amount of TO is preferable. Divalent<br>
alcohols (DIO) include alkylene glycol (ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene<br>
glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,6-hexanediol); alkylene<br>
ether glycol (diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and polytetramethylene ether<br>
glycol); alicyclic diol (l,4-cyclohexane dimethanol and hydrogenated<br>
bisphenol A); bisphenols (bisphenol A, bisphenol F and bisphenol S);<br>
alkylene oxide adducts of the above alicyclic diol (ethylene oxide,<br>
propylene oxide and butylene oxide); and alkylene oxide adducts of the<br>
above bisphenols (ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide).<br>
Among them, alkylene oxide adducts of alkylene glycol having 2 to 12<br>
carbons and bisphenols are preferred. Particularly preferred are<br>
alkylene oxide adducts of bisphenols, and combinations of alkylene glycol<br>
having 2 to 12 carbons therewith. Alcohols with three or more valence<br>
(TO) include trivalent to octavalent or higher-valent polyvalent aliphatic<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
alcohol (glycerin, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol<br>
and sorbitol)," trivalent or more phenols (tris phenol PA, phenol novolack<br>
and cresol novolack); and alkylene oxide adducts of the above trivalent or<br>
highervalent polyphenols.<br>
Polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) includes bivalent carboxylic acid<br>
(DIC) and trivalent or highervalent carboxylic acid (TC). DIC alone or a<br>
mixture of DIC with TC in a small amount is preferable. Bivalent<br>
carboxylic acid DIC includes alkylene dicarboxylic acids (succinic acid,<br>
adipic acid and sebacic acid); alkenylene dicarboxylic acids (maleic acid,<br>
fumaric acid); aromatic dicarboxylic acids (phthalic acid, isophthalic acid,<br>
terephthalic acid and naphthalene dicarboxylic acid). Among them,<br>
alkenylene dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 20 carbons and aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 20 carbons are preferred. Trivalent or<br>
higher-valent carboxylic acids (TC) include aromatic polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acids (trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid) having 9 to 20 carbons.<br>
As polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC), acid anhydrate or lower alkyl ester<br>
(methyl ester, ethyl ester and isopropyl ester) of the above may be used to<br>
react with polyvalent alcohol (PO).<br>
The ratio of polyvalent alcohol (PO) to polyvalent carboxylic acid<br>
(PC) is typically 2/1 to 1/1, preferably 1.5/1 to 1/1, and more preferably<br>
1.3/1 to 1.02/1 as an equivalent ratio of a hydroxyl group [OH] to a<br>
carboxyl group [COOH], i.e. [OH]/[COOH].<br>
In the polymerization and condensation reaction, a polyvalent<br>
alcohol (PO) and a polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) are heated to 150 °C to<br>
280 °C under the presence of a heretofore known esterification catalyst<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
such as tetrabutoxy titanate or dibutyltin oxide and distilling off<br>
produced water under reducing pressure if necessary to produce. a<br>
polyester comprising a hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl value of the<br>
polyester is preferably 5 (mg KOH/g) or greater, and the acid value of the<br>
polyester is typically 1 to 30 (mg KOH/g), and preferably 5 to 20. The<br>
acid value gives the toner a negative charge property, and further the<br>
favorable affinity between recording paper and the. toner improves the<br>
low-temperature fixing property an affinity between recording paper and<br>
the toner. However, when the acid value exceeds 30, the stability of the<br>
charging is prone to deteriorate with environmental variation.<br>
A weight average molecular weight is 10,000 to 400,000, and<br>
preferably 20,000 to 200,000. The weight average molecular weight of<br>
less than 10,000 is not preferable because the hot offset resistance is<br>
reduced. When it exceeds 400,000, it is not preferable because the low-<br>
temperature fixing property is reduced.<br>
(Polyester prepolymer with a functional group comprising a nitrogen<br>
atom (A))<br>
The polyester preferably comprises a polyester modified with<br>
urea in addition to an unmodified polyester obtained by the above<br>
polymerization and condensation reaction. The urea modified polyester<br>
is obtained by reacting a polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC) with a<br>
carboxyl group or a hydroxyl group at an end of the polyester obtained by<br>
the above polymerization and condensation reaction to yield a polyester<br>
prepolymer (A) comprising an isocyanate group, and reacting amines<br>
therewith to crosslink and/or extend the molecular chain.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
Examples of the polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC) include<br>
aliphatic polyvalent isocyanate (tetramethylene diisocyanate,<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate and 2,6-diisocyanatomethyl caproate):<br>
alicyclic polyisocyanate (isophorone diisocyanate and cyclohexylmethane<br>
diisocyanate); aromatic diisocyanate (trilene diisocyanate and<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate) ; aromatic aliphatic diisocyanate<br>
(a,a,a',a'-tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate) ; isocyanates; compounds<br>
obtained by blocking the above polyisocyanate with a phenol derivative,<br>
oxime, or caprolactam; and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
The ratio of the polyvalent isocyanate compound (PIC) is typically<br>
5/1 to 1/1, preferably 4/1 to 2/1 and more preferably 2.5/1 to 1.5/1 as the<br>
equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups [NCO] to hydroxyl groups [OH] of<br>
polyester having the hydroxyl groups, i.e. [NCO]/[OH]. When<br>
[NCO]/[OHl exceeds five, the low-temperature fixing property is reduced.<br>
When the molar ratio of [NCO] is less than one, the contained amount of<br>
urea portion becomes low with the use of the urea modified polyester,<br>
which consequently reduces the hot offset resistance.<br>
The composition of isocyanate compound (PIC) in the polyester<br>
prepolymer (A) comprising an isocyanate group is typically 0.5 % to 40 %<br>
by mass, preferably 1 % to 30 % by mass and more preferably 2 % to 20 %<br>
by mass. When the amount is less than 0.5 % by mass, the hot offset<br>
resistance is reduced, and at the same time, it is disadvantageous in<br>
terms of both heat-resistant storage stability and low-temperature fixing<br>
property. When it exceeds 40 % by mass, the low-temperature fixing<br>
property is reduced.<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
The number of the isocyanate group comprised in one molecule of<br>
the polyester prepolymer (A) comprising an isocyanate groups is typically<br>
one or more, preferably an average of 1.5 to 3, and more preferably an<br>
average of 1.8 to 2.5. When the number of the isocyanate group is less<br>
than one per molecule, the molecular weight of the urea modified<br>
polyester is small, which reduces the hot offset resistance.<br>
Examples of amines (B) to be reacted with the polyester<br>
prepolymer (A) comprising an isocyanate group include bivalent amine<br>
compounds (Bl), trivalent or higher-valent amine compounds (B2), amino<br>
alcohol (B3), aminomercaptan (B4), amino acids (B5) and those obtained<br>
by blocking the amino groups in Bl to B5 (B6).<br>
Examples of the bivalent amine compounds (Bl) include aromatic<br>
diamine (phenylene diamine, diethyltoluene diamine and 4,4'-<br>
diaminodiphenylmethane); alicyclic diamine, (4,4'-diamino-3,3'-<br>
dimethyldicyclohexylmethane, diamine cyclohexane and isophorone<br>
diamine);	and	aliphatic	diamine	(ethylenediamine,<br>
tetramethylenedia mine and hexamethylenediamine).<br>
Examples of trivalent or higher-valent amine compounds (B2)<br>
include diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetraamine.<br>
Examples of amino alcohols (B3) include ethanol amine and<br>
hydroxyethylaniline.<br>
Examples of aminomercaptan (B4) include aminoethylmercaptan<br>
and aminopropylmercaptan.<br>
Examples of amino acids (B5) include aminopropionic acid and<br>
aminocaproic acid.<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
Those obtained by blocking the amino group in Bl to B5 (B6)<br>
include ketimine compounds and oxazolidine compounds obtained from<br>
amines and ketones (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone) of the above Bl to B5. Among these amines, Bl and a mixture of<br>
Bl with a small amount of B2 are preferred.<br>
The ratio of amines (B) is typically 1/2 to 2/1, preferably 1.5/1 to<br>
1/1.5 and more preferably 1.2/1 to 1/1.2 as the equivalent ratio of the<br>
isocyanate groups [NCO] in the polyester prepolymer (A) comprising an<br>
isocyanate group to the amino groups [NHx] in amines (B), i.e.<br>
[NCOMNHx].<br>
When [NCO]/[NHx] is greater than two or is less than 1/2, the<br>
molecular weight of the urea modified polyester becomes low, and the hot<br>
offset resistance is reduced.<br>
The urea modified polyester may also comprise a urethane bond<br>
as well as a urea bond. The molar ratio of the urea bonds to the<br>
urethane bonds to be contained is typically 100/0 to 10/90, preferably<br>
80/20 to 20/80, and more preferably 60/40 to 30/70. When the molar ratio<br>
of the urea bond is less than 10 %, the hot offset resistance is reduced.<br>
The urea modified polyester is produced by a one-shot method.<br>
A polyester comprising a hydroxyl group is obtained by heating<br>
polyvalent alcohol (PO) and polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) to 150 °C to<br>
280 °C under the presence of a heretofore known esterification catalyst<br>
such as tetrabutoxy titanate or dibutyltin oxide and distilling off the<br>
produced water under reducing pressure if necessary. Then, this is<br>
reacted with polyvalent isocyanate (PIC) at 40 °C to 140 °C to yield the<br>

polyester prepolymer (A) comprising an isocyanate group. Furthermore,<br>
amines (B) is reacted this (A) at 0 °C to 140 °C to yield the urea modified<br>
polyester.<br>
A solvent can also be used as needed in the reaction of PIC or in<br>
the reaction of the polyester prepolymer (A) and amines (B). Examples of<br>
a usable solvent include those such as aromatic solvents such as toluene<br>
and xylenel ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone! esters such as ethyl acetate; amides such as<br>
dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; and ethers such<br>
astetrahydrofuran, which are inert for isocyanate (PIC).<br>
The molecular weight of the resulting urea modified polyester can<br>
be adjusted with a reaction terminator if necessary in the crosslinking<br>
reaction and/or the extension reaction of the polyester prepolymer (A)<br>
and amines (B). Examples of the reaction terminator include monoamine<br>
such as diethylamine, dibutylamine, butylamine and laurylamine," and<br>
those obtained by "blocking them such as ketimine compounds.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the urea modified<br>
polyester is typically 10,000 or more, preferably 20,000 to 10,000,000 and<br>
more preferably 30,000 to 1,000,000. When it is less than 10,000, the hot<br>
offset resistance is reduced. The number average molecular weight of<br>
the urea modified polyester is not particularly limited when the above<br>
unmodified polyester is used, and the number average molecular weight<br>
may be adjusted so that the above weight average molecular weight is<br>
easily obtained. When the urea modified polyester is used alone, the<br>
number average molecular weight thereof is typically 2,000 to 20,000,<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
preferably 2,000 to 10,000 and more preferably 2,000 to 8,000. When it<br>
exceeds 20,000, the lowtemperature fixing property and the luster<br>
property for a full-color apparatus are reduced.<br>
Since the lowtemperature fixing property and the luster property<br>
for a full-color apparatus are enhanced by combining the unmodified<br>
polyester with the urea modified polyester, the combination is more<br>
preferable than the case of using the urea modified polyester alone. The<br>
unmodified polyester may comprise a polyester modified with chemical<br>
bonds other than urea bonds.<br>
It is preferable in terms of low-temperature fixing property and<br>
hot offset resistance that the unmodified polyester and the urea modified<br>
polyester are at least partially compatible. Therefore, it is preferable<br>
that the unmodified polyester and the urea modified polyester have<br>
similar compositions.<br>
The mass ratio of the unmodified polyester to the urea modified<br>
polyester is typically 20/80 to 95/5, preferably 70/30 to 95/5, more<br>
preferably 75/25 to 95/5 and particularly preferably 80/20 to 93/7. When<br>
the mass ratio of the urea modified polyester is less than 5 %, the hot<br>
offset resistance is reduced, and at the same time it is disadvantageous<br>
in terms of balancing the heat resistant storage stability and the low-<br>
temperature fixing property.<br>
The glass transition point (Tg) of the binder resin comprising the<br>
unmodified polyester and the urea modified polyester is typically 45 °C to<br>
65 °C, and preferably 45 °C to 60 °C. When it is lower than 45 °C, the<br>
toner heat resistance is reduced; whereas when it is higher than 65 °C,<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
the low-temperature fixing property is insufficient.<br>
The urea modified polyester tends to present on the surface of the<br>
resulting toner base particles. Therefore, even when the glass transition<br>
point is lower compared to a heretofore known polyester based toner, the<br>
heat resistant storage stability is favorable.<br>
-Colorants-<br>

The content of the above colorant is typically 1 % to 15 % by mass,<br>
and preferably 3 % to 10 % by mass based on the toner.<br>
The above colorants may be used as a master batch which is a<br>
complex with the resin. Examples of a binder resin used for producing<br>
the master batch or kneaded with the master batch includes the<br>
following: polymers of styrene and derivative thereof such as polystyrene,<br>
poly-p-chlorostyrene and polyvinyl toluene, or copolymers of vinyl<br>
compounds therewith, polymethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyester, epoxy resins, epoxy polyol resins, polyurethane, polyamide,<br>
polyvinyl butyral,- polyacrylic acid resins, rosin, modified rosin, terpene<br>
resins, aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon resins, aromatic petroleum<br>
resins, chlorinated paraffin and paraffin wax. These may be used alone<br>
or in combination.<br>
-Charge controller-<br>
A heretofore known charge controller may be used, and examples<br>
thereof include nigrosine based dyes, triphenylmethane based dyes,<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
chromium containing metal complex dyes, molybdic acid chelated<br>
pigments, rhodamine based dyes, alkoxy based a mine, quaternary<br>
ammonium salts (including fluorine modified quaternary ammonium<br>
salts), alkylamide, a single substance or compounds of phosphorous, a<br>
single substance or compounds of tungsten, fluorine based activator,<br>
metal salts such as salicylate metal salts and salicylate derivatives.<br>
Specifically, Bontron 03 which is the nigrosine based dye, Bontron P-51<br>
which is the quaternary ammonium salt, Bontron S-34 which is a metal<br>
containing azo dye, E-82 which is an oxynaphthoic acid based metal<br>
complex, E-84 which is a salicylic acid based metal complex and E-89<br>
which is a phenol based condensate which are manufactured by Orient<br>
Chemical Industries Ltd., TP-302 and TP-415 which are quaternary<br>
ammonium salt molybdate complexes, which are manufactured by<br>
Hodogaya Chemical Co., Ltd., Copy Charge PSY VP2038 which is the<br>
quaternary ammonium salt, Copy Blue PR which is a triphenylmethane<br>
derivative, Copy Charge NEG VP2036 and Copy Charge NX VP434<br>
which are the quaternary ammonium salts, which are manufactured by<br>
Hoechst AG, LR.-147 which is a boron complex (manufactured by Japan<br>
Carlit Co., Ltd.), copper phthalocyanine, perylene, quinacridone, azo<br>
based pigments) and additionally polymer compounds having a<br>
functional group such as sulfonate, carboxyl groups and quaternary<br>
ammonium salts. Among them, a substance which controls the toner to<br>
negative polarity is preferably used.<br>
The amount of the charge controller to be used depends on the<br>
toner production method including the type of the binder resin, the<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
presence or absence of the optionally used additives and the dispersion<br>
method. The amount is not clearly defined, but it is preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1 parts to 10 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the<br>
binder resin. Preferably, it is in the range of 0.2 parts to 5 parts by mass.<br>
When the amount exceeds 10 parts by mass, the charge property of the<br>
toner is excessively large, the effect of the charge controller is reduced,<br>
and the electrostatic suction power to the development roller is increased,<br>
resulting in flowability reduction of the developer and reduction of an<br>
image density in some cases.<br>
Releasing agent-<br>
As a releasing agent, a wax having a low melting point of 50 °C to<br>
120 °C works effectively between a fixing roller and a toner boundary<br>
surface as the releasing agent, in the dispersion with the binder resin,<br>
and this is effective for a high-temperature offset without an application<br>
of a releasing agent such as oil on the fixing roller. Examples of such<br>
wax component includes plant based waxes such as carnauba wax, cotton<br>
wax, tree wax and rice wax," animal based waxes such as bee wax and<br>
lanolini mineral based waxes such as ozokerite and selsyn; and<br>
petroleum based waxes such as paraffin, microcrystalline and petrolatum.<br>
In addition to these natural waxes, synthetic hydrocarbon waxes such as<br>
Fischer-Tropsch waxes and polyethylene waxes, and synthetic waxes of<br>
ester, ketone and. ether are included. Furthermore, it is possible to use a<br>
fatty acid amide such as 12"hydroxystearic acid amide, stearic acid amide,<br>
phthalic acid anhydrate imide and chlorinated hydrocarbon, and<br>
crystalline polymers having a long alkyl group in a side chain such as<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
homopolymers and copolymers (e.g., copolymer of n-stearyl acrylate"ethyl<br>
methacrylate) of poly n-stearyl methacrylate, poly-n-lauryl methacrylate<br>
which, are crystalline polymer resins having low molecular weights.<br>
The charge controller and the releasing agent can be melted and<br>
kneaded with the master batch and the binder resin, or they may also be<br>
added when dissolved and dispersed in the organic solvent. Substances<br>
described above may be used for the releasing agent and the inorganic<br>
particulates.<br>
(Method for producing toner)<br>
Subsequently, the method for producing the toner is described.<br>
Herein, a preferable production method is described, but this is not to be<br>
construed as limiting a production method of the present invention.<br>
(l) A toner material solution is made by dispersing a colorant, an<br>
unmodified polyester, a polyester prepolymer comprising an isocyanate<br>
group and a releasing agent in an organic solvent.<br>
It is preferable that the organic solvent is volatile with a boiling<br>
point lower than 100 °C in terms of an easy removal after forming toner<br>
base particles. Specifically, water-insoluble or water-immiscible<br>
compounds such as toluene, xylene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride,<br>
methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, chloroform,<br>
monochlorobenzene, dichloroethylidene, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more. In particular, aromatic solvents such as<br>
toluene and xylene, and halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene<br>
chloride,  1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride  are<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
preferable. The amount of the organic solvent to be used is typically 0<br>
parts to 300 parts by mass, preferably 0 parts to 100 parts by mass and<br>
more preferably 25 parts to 70 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass<br>
of the polyester prepolymer.<br>
Herein, it is preferable to disperse inorganic particulates inside<br>
the toner, more preferably in the vicinity of the surface in order to control<br>
toner shapes. It is possible to make the shape of the toner surface<br>
concavoconvex by taking advantage of the shape of the inorganic<br>
particulates or the difference of the shrinking speed within the toner in<br>
an emulsification desolvation process. The inorganic particulates and<br>
the desolvation are particularly effective for enlarging the cycle (i.e.<br>
reducing the value of RMS of the degree of concavoconvex), i.e. 'further<br>
deepening a depth of the concave portion of the concavoconvex,' as well as<br>
enlarging the surface roughness (Ra). The substances described above<br>
may be used for the inorganic particulates; among these, inorganic<br>
particulates such as silica and more preferably organosilica are more<br>
preferable in terms of shape control or charge stability over timeor<br>
environmental charge stability.<br>
(2) The toner material solution is emulsified in an aqueous<br>
medium under the presence of a surfactant and resin particulates.<br>
The aqueous medium may be water alone or water comprising an<br>
organic solvent such as alcohol (methanol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene<br>
glycol), dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, cellsolves (methyl cellsolve)<br>
and lower ketones (acetone and methyl ethyl ketone).<br>
The amount of the aqueous medium to be used is typically 50<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
parts to 2,000 parts by mass and preferably 100 parts to 1,000 parts by<br>
mass based on 100 parts by mass of the toner material solution. When<br>
the amount is less than 50 parts by mass, the toner material solution is<br>
not dispersed well, and the toner base particles having given particle<br>
diameter are not obtained. When it exceeds 2,000 parts by mass, it is not<br>
economical.<br>
Dispersants such as surfactant and resin p articulates are<br>
optionally added in order to well disperse toner material liquid drops<br>
(crosslinked or extended during a dispersion process) in the aqueous<br>
medium..<br>
Example of the surfactant include anionic surfactants such as<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonate salts, ocolefin sulfonate salts and phosphate ester,<br>
cationic surfactants such as amine salt types such as alkylamine salts,<br>
amino alcohol fatty acid derivatives, polyamine, fatty acid derivatives<br>
and imidazoline, and quaternary ammonium salt types such as<br>
alkyltrimethylammonium salts, dialkyldimethylammonium salts,<br>
altyldimethylbenzylammonium	salts,	pyridinium	salts,<br>
alkylisoquinolinium salts and benzethonium chloride, nonionic<br>
surfactants such as fatty acid amide derivatives and polyvalent alcohol<br>
derivatives, and ampholytic surfactant such as alanine,<br>
dodecyldi(aminoethyl)glycine, di(octylaminoethyl)glycine and N-alkyl"<br>
N,N-dimethylammonium betaine.<br>
A surfactant comprising a fluoroalkyl group is advantageous<br>
since the use of an extremely small amount of the surfactant is effective.<br>
The preferably used anionic surfactants comprising a fluoroalkyl group<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
include fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids having 2 to 10 carbons and metal<br>
salts thereof, disodium perfluorooctanesulfonyl glutamate, sodium 3-[or<br>
fhioroalkyl (6 to 11 carbons)oxy]-l-alkyl (3 to 4 carbons) sulfonate, sodium<br>
3-[ar£luoroaIkanoyl (6 to 8 carbons)-N-ethylamono]-l-propane sulfonate,<br>
fluoroalkyl (11 to 20 carbons) carboxylic acids and metal salts thereof,<br>
perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (7 to 13 carbons) and metal salts thereof,<br>
perfLuoroalkyl (4 to 12) sulfonic acids and metal salts thereof,<br>
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid diethanol amide, N-propyl"N-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyOperfluorooctane sulfone amide, perfLuoroalkyl (6 to 10<br>
carbons) sulfone amide propyltrimethyl ammonium salts, perfluoroalkyl<br>
(6 to 10 carbons)-N-ethylsulfonyl glycine salts and perfluoroalkyl (6 to 16<br>
carbons) ethyl phosphate ester. Trade names thereof include Surflon S-<br>
111, S-112 and S-113 (manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), Fluorad<br>
FC-93, FC-95, Fc98 and FC-129 (manufactured by Sumitomo Three M<br>
Co., Ltd.), Unidain DS-101 and DS-102 (manufactured by Daikin<br>
Industries Ltd.), Megafac F-110, F-120, F-113, F-191, F-812 and F-833<br>
(manufactured by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Incorporated), EFTOP<br>
EF-102, 103, 104, 105, 112, 123A, 123B, 306A, 501, 201 and 204<br>
(manufactured by Tohchem Products Co., Ltd.) and FTAKGENT F-100<br>
and F-105 (manufactured by Neos Co., Ltd.).<br>
The cationic surfactants include aliphatic primary secondary or<br>
tertiary amic acids having fluoroalkyl groups, aliphatic quaternary<br>
ammonium salts such as perfluoroalkyl (6 to 10 carbons) sulfonamide<br>
propyltrimethyl ammonium salts, and benzalkonium salts,<br>
benzethonium chloride, pyridinium salts, imidazolium salts, and as the<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
trade names, Surflon S-121 (manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.),<br>
Fluorad FO135 (manufactured by Sumitomo Three M Co., Ltd.), Unidain<br>
DS-202 (manufactured by Daikin Industries Ltd.), Megafac F-150 and F-<br>
824 (manufactured by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Incorporated),<br>
EFTOP EF-132 (manufactured by Tohchem Products Co., Ltd.), and<br>
FTARGENT F-300 (manufactured by Neos Co., Ltd.).<br>
The resin particulates (organic particulates) are added in order to<br>
stabilize the toner base particles formed in the aqueous medium and to<br>
provide the surface roughness.<br>
The effect on the concavoconvex of the toner surface varies<br>
depending on the particle diameter of the resin particulates and the<br>
adhering conditions (embedment, planar deformation or partial<br>
desorption (by acid, alkali, solvent or mechanical treatment) of the resin<br>
particulates on the toner surface. Ra as well as RMS is large when the<br>
resin particulates having a larger particle diameter are adhered to the<br>
surface of the spherical toner while maintaining the shape of the resin<br>
particulates. On the other hand, Ra as well as RMS becomes small when<br>
the resin particulates are small or the toner has embedment, planar<br>
deformation or a partial desorption inside the toner. Meanwhile, the<br>
value of RMS is easily affected by the shape having a large cycle as well<br>
as the resin particulates. Thus, it is often difficult to control the value of<br>
RMS by solely controlling the organic particulates. The large cycle may<br>
be easily modified by taking advantage of the inorganic particulates and<br>
additionally the shrinkage of the desolvation.<br>
It is preferable to add the resin particulates so that the fraction of<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
resin particulates coating over the surface of the toner base particles is in<br>
the range of 10 % to 90 %. Examples thereof include polymethacrylic<br>
acid methyl particulates of 1 urn and 3 urn, polystyrene particulates of<br>
0.2 mrn and 2 urn, poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) particulates of 1 urn, and as<br>
the trade names, PB-200H (manufactured by Kao Corporation), SGP<br>
(manufactured by Soken Chemical &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd.),<br>
Technopolymer SB (manufactured by Sekisui Plastics Co., Ltd.), SGP-3G<br>
(manufactured by Soken Chemical &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd.) and<br>
Micropearl (manufactured by Sekisui Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.).<br>
Inorganic compound dispersants such as tricalcium phosphate,<br>
calcium carbonate, titanium oxide, colloidal silica and hydroxyapatite<br>
can also be used.<br>
Polymer based protection colloid may be used as a dispersant (or<br>
dispersion stabilizer) to stabilize the dispersed liquid drops in<br>
combination with the foregoing resin particulates and inorganic<br>
compound dispersant. Examples thereof include homopolymers or<br>
copolymers of the following compounds; acids such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, a-cyanoacrylic acid, a-cyanomethacrylic acid, itaconic<br>
acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and maleic acid anhydrate;<br>
(meth)acrylic monomers comprising a hydroxyl group such as acrylic<br>
acid-p-hydroxylethyl, methacrylic acid-p-hydroxylethyl, acrylic acid-p-<br>
hydroxylpropyl, methacrylic acid-p-hydroxylpropyl, acrylic acid-y-<br>
hydroxylpropyl, methacrylic acid-yhydroxylpropyl, acrylic acid-3-chloro-<br>
2-hydroxylpropyl, methacrylic acid-3-chloro-2-hydroxylpropyl, diethylene<br>
glycol monoacrylate ester,  diethylene glycol monomethacrylate ester,<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
glycerin monoacrylate ester, glycerin monomethacrylate ester and N-<br>
metliylol methacrylamide; vinyl alcohols or ethers with vinyl alcohol such<br>
as vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether and vinyl propyl ether; esters of<br>
vinyl alcohol with a compound comprising a carboxylic group such as<br>
vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl butyrate; acrylamide,<br>
methacrylami.de, diacetone acrylamide, and methylol compounds thereof<br>
acid chlorides such as acrylate chloride and methacrylate chloride,"<br>
nitrogen-containing compounds such as vinyl pyridine, vinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
vinyl imidazole and ethylene inline," and those comprising a heterocyclic<br>
ring thereof. More examples of the polymer based protection colloid<br>
include polyoxyethylenes such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkylamine, polyoxypropylene alkylamine,<br>
polyoxyethylene         alkylamide,         polyoxypropylene	alkylamide,<br>
polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene laurylphenyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene stearylphenyl ether and polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl<br>
ester, and celluloses such as methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose.<br>
The method of dispersion is not particularly limited, and<br>
heretofore known equipments such as low-speed shearing method, high-<br>
speed shearing method, high-pressure jet method and ultrasonic method<br>
may be applied. Among them, the high-speed searing method, is<br>
preferable for making the particle diameter of the dispersion 2 mm to 20<br>
mm. The rotational frequency of a high speed shearing dispersion<br>
machine is not particularly limited, but it is typically 1,000 rpm to 30,000<br>
rpm and preferably 5,000 rpm to 20,000 rpm. The dispersion time period<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
is not particularly limited, but it is typically 0.1 minutes to 5 minutes in<br>
the case of a batch mode. The temperature during dispersion is typically<br>
0 °C to 150 °C (under pressure) and preferably 40 °C to 98 °C.<br>
The releasing agent can be comprised in the aqueous medium<br>
phase because it can transfer to the organic solvent phase due to its<br>
lipophilicity even if it is initially comprised in the aqueous medium phase.<br>
However, it is more preferable that the releasing agent is comprised in<br>
the organic solvent phase.<br>
(3)	Amines (B) is added simultaneously with the production of an<br>
emulsified liquid to react with the polyester prepolymer (A) comprising<br>
an isocyanate group.<br>
This reaction accompanies crosslinking and/or extension of the<br>
molecular chain. The duration of the reaction is selected based on the<br>
reactivity of amines with the isocyanate group structure of the polyester<br>
prepolymer (A). It is typically 10 minutes to 40 hours, and preferably 2<br>
hours to 24 hours. The reaction temperature is typically 0 °C to 150 °C,<br>
and preferably 40 °C to 98 °C. A heretofore known catalyst can be used<br>
as needed. Examples of the catalyst includes dibutyltin laurate and<br>
dioctyltin laurate.<br>
(4)	After the reaction is completed, the organic solvent is removed<br>
from an emulsified dispersion (reactant), and the emulsified dispersion is<br>
then washed and dried to yield toner base particles.<br>
The entire system is gradually heated with laminar stirring," a<br>
strong agitation is given at a certain temperature range followed by<br>
desolvation to removed the organic solvent, which as a result produces<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
spindle-shaped toner base particles. When a compound which may<br>
dissolve in acid and alkali solution such as calcium phosphate salt is<br>
used as a dispersion stabilizer, the calcium phosphate salt is removed<br>
from the toner base particles by dissolving the salt with acid such as<br>
hydrochloric acid and then washing with water. Additionally, the<br>
dispersion stabilizer can be removed by decomposition with an enzyme.<br>
(5) A charge controller is added to the toner base particles<br>
obtained above, and then inorganic particulates such as silica<br>
particulates and titanium oxide particulates are added externally to<br>
obtain the toner.<br>
The addition of the charge controller and the external addition of<br>
the inorganic particulates are performed by heretofore known methods<br>
using a mixer.<br>
By this a toner with small particle diameter and sharp particle<br>
diameter distribution is easily obtained. In addition, the shape can be<br>
controlled from a pearl shape to a spindle shape by strong agitation in<br>
the process of removing the organic solvent, and furthermore, surface<br>
morphology can be controlled from a smooth shape to a dimple shape.<br>
(Developer)<br>
A developer of the present invention comprises the toner of the<br>
present invention and optionally selected other components such as<br>
carrier. The developer may be a one-component developer or a two-<br>
component developer, and the two-component developer is preferable in<br>
terms of enhanced lifetime when used for high speed printers compatible<br>
with the recent enhancement in information processing speed.<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
In the case of the one-component developer with the toner of the<br>
present invention, there is little variation in the toner particle diameter<br>
even though the toner is balanced. Since there is no filming of the toner<br>
to a developing roller and no fusion of the toner to a member such as<br>
blade that makes the toner a thin layer, favorable and stable developing<br>
property and images are achieved during the prolonged use (stirring) of<br>
the developing unit. Regarding the two-component developer with the<br>
toner of the present invention, there is little variation of toner particle<br>
diameter in the developer even though the toner is balanced over a<br>
prolonged period of time, and favorable and stable developing property<br>
are obtained in stirring in the developing unit for a prolonged period of<br>
time.<br>
The foregoing carrier is not particularly limited and can be<br>
optionally selected depending on the purpose, but those having a core<br>
material and a resin layer which coats the core material are preferable.<br>
Materials for the core material are not particularly limited, and<br>
can be optionally selected from those heretofor known. For example,<br>
manganese-strontium (Mn-Sr) based materials and manganese-<br>
magnesium (Mn-Mg) based materials of 50 emu/g to 90 emu/g are<br>
preferable. In terms of assuring the image density, highly magnetized<br>
materials such as iron powder (100 emu/g or greater) and magnetite (75<br>
emu/g to 120 emu/g) are preferable. Weakly magnetized materials such<br>
as copper-zinc (Cu-Zn) based materials (30 emu/g to 80 emu/g) are<br>
preferable in the respect that the contact of the toner in a spike-standing<br>
state   with   the   photoconductor   can   be   softened   and   that   it   is<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
advantageous for making the image have high quality.   These may be<br>
used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>

particle diameter, i.e. the volume average particle diameter (D50), is<br>
preferably 10 mrn to 200 mrn, and more preferably 40 mm to 100 mm.<br>
When the average particle diameter, i.e. volume average particle<br>
diameter (D50), is less than 10 urn, the fraction of fine powder increases,<br>
and magnetization per particle becomes low to cause carrier scattering in<br>
some cases. When it exceeds 200 mm, the specific surface area is reduced<br>
to cause toner scattering in some cases, and in particular, affect the<br>
reproduction of solid images in a full-color printing comprising many<br>
solid images.<br>
Materials for the resin layer are not particularly limited and can<br>
be optionally selected from heretofore known resins depending on the<br>
purpose. Examples thereof include amino based resins, polyvinyl based<br>
resins, polystyrene based resins, halogenated olefin resins, polyester<br>
based resins, polycarbonate based resins, polyethylene resins,<br>
polyfluorovinyl resins, polyfhiorovinylidene resins, polytrifLuoroetbylene<br>
resins, polyhexafluoropropylene resins, copolymers of fluorovinylidene<br>
and acryl monomer, copolymers of fluorovinylidene and fhiorovinyl,<br>
fluoroterpolymer such as terpolymer of tetrafhioroethylene and<br>
fluorovinylidene and non-fluoride monomer and silicone resins. These<br>
may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
The amino based resins include, for example, urea-formaldehyde<br>
resins, melamine resins, benzoguanamine resins, urea resins, polyamide<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
resins and epoxy resins. The polyvinyl based resins include, for example,<br>
acryl resins, polymethyl methacrylate resins, polyacrylonitrile resins,<br>
polyvinyl acetate resins, polyvinyl alcohol resins and polyvinyl butyral<br>
resins. The polystyrene based resins include, for example, polystyrene<br>
resins and styrene-acryl copolymer resins. The halogenated olefin resins<br>
include, for example, polyvinyl chloride. The polyester based resins<br>
include, for example, polyethylene terephthalate resins and polybutylene<br>
terephthalate resins.<br>
Conductive powder may be comprised in the resin layer as needed,<br>
and the conductive powder includes, for example, metal powder, carbon<br>
black, titanium oxide, tin oxide and zinc oxide. The average particle<br>
diameter of these conductive powder is preferably 1 urn or less. When<br>
the average particle diameter exceeds 1 mm, it becomes difficult to control<br>
the electric resistance in some cases.<br>
The resin layer can be formed by dissolving a silicone resin in the<br>
solvent to prepare a coating solution, subsequently applying the coating<br>
solution uniformly on the surface of the core material by a heretofore<br>
known coating method and drying followed by calcination. The coating<br>
method includes, for example, a dipping method, a spraying method and<br>
a brushing method.<br>
The above solvent is not particularly limited can be optionally<br>
selected depending on the purpose. Examples thereof include toluene,<br>
xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cellsolve butyl<br>
acetate.<br>
The method of calcination is not particularly limited," it may be an<br>

external heating method or an internal heating method. Examples<br>
thereof include methods using a fixed electric furnace, a fluid electric<br>
furnace, a rotary electric furnace and a burner furnace; and a method<br>
using microwaves.<br>
The amount of the resin layer in the carrier is preferably 0.01 %<br>
to 5.0 % by mass. When the amount is less than 0.01 % by mass, the<br>
uniform resin layer can not be formed on the surface of the core material<br>
in some cases. When it exceeds 5.0 % by mass, the resin layer becomes<br>
excessively thick to cause granulation within the carrier, and thus<br>
uniform carrier particles can not be obtained in some cases.<br>
When the developer is a two-component developer, the content of<br>
the carrier in the two-component developer is not particularly limited<br>
and can be optionally selected depending on the purpose. For example, it<br>
is preferably 90 % to 98 % by mass and more preferably 93 % to 97 % by<br>
mass.<br>
In general, the mixing ratio of the toner to the carrier in the two-<br>
component developer is preferably 1 parts to 10.0 parts by mass of the<br>
toner based on 100 parts by mass of the carrier.<br>
The developer of the present invention comprises the toner of the<br>
present invention. Therefore, the occurrence of photoconductor filming<br>
can be prevented, there is, and it is possible to stably form an excellent<br>
and sharp images having high quality and no variation in" the<br>
unevenness of image.<br>

rotating in the direction of the arrow, with charging by the charging unit<br>
102 and exposure 103 by the exposing unit (not shown in the figure).<br>
This latent electrostatic image is toner-developed in the developing unit<br>
104. The tonerdeveloped image is transferred by the transferring unit<br>

photoconductor surface after transferring the image is cleaned by the<br>
cleaning unit 107 and further neutralized by the neutralizing unit (not<br>

out by the latent electrostatic image forming unit; the developing process<br>
can be carried out by the developing unit; the transferring process can be<br>
carried out by the transferring unit; the fixing process can be carried out<br>
by the fixing unit; and the other processes can be carried out by the other<br>
units.<br>
-Latent electrostatic image forming process and latent electrostatic<br>
image forming unit-<br>
The latent, electrostatic image forming process is a process of<br>
forming a latent electrostatic image on the latent image bearing member.<br>
The latent image bearing member (sometimes referred to as<br>
an 'electrographic photoconductor' or a 'photoconductor') is not<br>
particularly limited in terms of material, shape, structure and size, and<br>
it can be appropriately selected from those heretofore known. However,<br>
the shape is favorably a drum shape, and the materials thereof include<br>
51<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
inorganic photoconductors such as amorphous silicon and selenium, and<br>
organic photoconductors such as polysilane and phthalopolymethine.<br>
Among them, amorphous silicon is preferable in terms of long lifetime.<br>
Regarding the amorphous silicon photoconductor, it is possible to<br>
use a photoconductor having a photoconductive layer composed of a-Si<br>
(sometimes referred to as an 'a-Si based photoconductor'), obtained by<br>
heating a support to 50 °C to 400 °C and making the layer on the support<br>
by a film forming method such as vacuum deposition method, spattering<br>
method, ion plating method, thermal CVD method, photo-assisted CVD<br>
method and plasma CVD method. Among them, the plasma CVD method,<br>
i.e. the method in which a source gas is decomposed by direct current,<br>
high frequency or microwave glow discharge to form an a"Si deposition<br>
film on the support, is favorable.<br>
The latent electrostatic image can be formed by charging the<br>
surface of the latent image bearing member and subsequently exposing<br>
according to the image; it can be performed with the latent electrostatic<br>
image forming unit.<br>
The latent electrostatic image forming unit comprises the<br>
charging section which charges the surface of the latent image bearing<br>
member and the exposing section which exposes the surface of the latent<br>
image bearing member according to the image.<br>
The charging can be performed by applying a voltage onto the<br>
surface of the latent image bearing member using the charging section.<br>
The charging section is not particularly limited, and it can be<br>
optionally selected depending on the purpose.  Examples thereof include<br>
52<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
contact charging sections per se heretofore known comprising a<br>
conductive or semi-conductive roller, brush, film and rubber blade; and<br>
non-contact charging section that uses corona discharge such as corotron<br>
and scorotron.<br>
The shape of the charging member may be of any form such as<br>
magnetic brush and fur brush in addition to roller, and it can be selected<br>
in concert with the specification and the form of the electrograph<br>
apparatus. When the magnetic brush is used, the magnetic brush uses<br>
various ferrite particles such as Zn-Cu ferrite as the charging member<br>
and is composed of a non-magnetic conductive sleeve for supporting the<br>
particles and a magnet roll enclosed in the sleeve. Also, when a brush is<br>
used, for example, a fur conductively treated with carbon, copper sulfide,<br>
metal or metal oxide is used as the material of the fur brush, and the<br>
charging section is made by looping or attaching the fur to a metal or<br>
other conductively treated core grids.<br>
The charging section is not limited to the above contact type<br>
charging sections. However, it is preferable to use a contact type<br>
charging section since an image forming apparatus with reduced ozone<br>
generated from the charging section is obtained.<br>
The exposure can be performed by exposing the surface of the<br>
latent image bearing member according to the image using the exposing<br>
section.<br>
The exposing section is not particularly limited as long as the<br>
exposure can be performed according to the image on the surface of the<br>
latent image bearing member charged by the charging section, and it can<br>
53<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
be optionally selected depending on the purpose. Examples thereof<br>
include various exposing sections such as replicating optical, rod lens<br>
alley based, laser optical and liquid-crystal shutter optical exposing<br>
sections.<br>
In the present invention, a back-lighting method in which the<br>
exposure is performed according to the image from the backside of the<br>
latent image bearing member may be employed.<br>
-Developing process and developing unit-<br>
The developing process is a process of developing the latent<br>
electrostatic image using the toner or the developer of the present<br>
invention to form a visible image.<br>
The formation of the visible image can be performed by<br>
developing the latent electrostatic image using the toner or the developer<br>
of the present invention, and it can be performed by the developing unit.<br>
The developing unit is not particularly limited as long as the<br>
development can be performed using the toner or the developer of the<br>
present invention. It can be optionally selected from those heretofore<br>
known, and suitable examples include those comprising a developing<br>
section which holds the toner or the developer of the present invention<br>
and can impart the toner or the developer of the present invention to the<br>
latent electrostatic image with or without contact. A developing section<br>
comprising a vessel with the toner of the present invention is more<br>
preferable.<br>
In the developing unit, the developer is borne and delivered by<br>
the latent image bearing member. An alternating electric field is applied<br>
54<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
at a position opposite to the latent image bearing member, and the latent<br>
electrostatic image on the latent image bearing member is developed,<br>
where the developer of the present invention is used as the developer.<br>
The developing section may be a dry developing system or a wet<br>
developing system,' moreover, it may be a single-color development<br>
section or a multi-color developing section. Suitable examples thereof<br>
include those having a stirring section which charges the toner or the<br>
developer by rubbing and stirring; and those having a rotatable magnet<br>
roller.<br>
In the developing section, the toner and the carrier are mixed and<br>
stirred, for example, where the toner is charged by friction and<br>
maintained in a spike-standing state on the surface of a rotating magnet<br>
roller to form a magnetic brush. The magnet roller is disposed in the<br>
vicinity of the latent image bearing member (photoconductor). Thus, a<br>
part of the toner which composes the magnetic brush formed on the<br>
surface of the magnet roller transfers to the surface of the latent image<br>
bearing member (photoconductor) by electrical attractive force. As a<br>
result, the latent electrostatic image is developed by the toner, and a<br>
visible image by the toner is formed on the latent image bearing member<br>
(photoconductor).<br>
The  developer held in the developing section is a developer<br>
comprising the toner of the present invention.   The developer may be a<br>
one-component developer or a two-component developer.    The toner<br>
comprised in the developer is the toner of the present invention.<br>
-Transferring process and transferring unit-<br>
55<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
The transferring process is a process that transfers the visible<br>
image to a recording medium. A preferable aspect is where, by<br>
employing an intermediate transferring member, the visible image is<br>
primarily transferred to the intermediate transferring member, and<br>
subsequently the visible image is secondarily transferred to the recording<br>
medium. A more preferable aspect comprises, with a toner with two or<br>
more colors or preferably a full-color toner as the toner,. a primary<br>
transferring process where a complex transfer image is formed by<br>
transferring the visible image onto the intermediate transferring<br>
member and a secondary transferring process where the complex<br>
transfer image is transferred onto the recording medium.<br>
The transfer can be performed by charging the visible image<br>
formed on the latent image bearing member (photoconductor) using a<br>
transferring and charging section, and it can be performed by the<br>
transferring unit. Regarding the transferring unit, the aspect having the<br>
primary transferring unit where the complex transfer image is formed by<br>
transferring the visible image onto the intermediate transferring<br>
member and the secondary transferring unit where the complex transfer<br>
image is transferred onto the recording medium is preferable.<br>
The intermediate transfer member is not particularly limited,<br>
and it can'be optionally selected from heretofore known transferring<br>
members depending on the. purpose. It favorably includes, for example, a<br>
transfer belt.<br>
It is preferable that the transferring unit (the primary<br>
transferring unit and the secondary transferring unit)  comprises a<br>

on the latent image bearing member onto the recording medium. The<br>
transferring unit may be one, or it may be two or more.<br>
Examples of the transferring section include a corona<br>
transferring section by corona discharge, a transfer belt, a transfer roller,<br>
pressure transfer roller and a tacky transferring section.<br>
The recording medium is typified by plain paper, but it is not<br>
particularly limited as long as an unfixed image after the development<br>
can be transferred.    It can be optionally selected depending on the<br>
purpose, and a PET base for OHPs and the lite can be used.<br>
-Fixing process and fixing unit-<br>
The fixing process is a process of fixing the visible image<br>
transferred onto the recording medium using a fixing apparatus. It may<br>
be performed at every transfer of each color toner onto the recording<br>
medium, or it may be performed all together simultaneously for<br>
respective color toners in a laminated state.<br>
The fixing apparatus is not particularly limited, and it can be<br>
optionally selected depending on the purpose. A heating and<br>
pressurizing unit heretofore known is preferable. The heating and<br>
pressurizing unit includes a combination of a heating roller and a<br>
pressurizing roller, and a combination of the heating roller, the<br>
pressurizing roller and an endless belt.<br>
A typical heating temperature in the heating and pressurizing<br>
unit is preferably 80 °C to 200 °C.<br>

bias to the latent image bearing member to neutralize, and it can be<br>
suitably performed by the neutralizing unit.<br>

and it can be optionally selected from publicly known neutralizing<br>
sections. Suitable examples include a neutralizing lamp.<br>

toner left on the latent image bearing member, and it can be suitably<br>
performed by the cleaning unit.<br>

The controlling unit is not particularly limited as long as the<br>
movement of each unit can be controlled, and it can be optionally selected<br>
depending on the purpose. Examples include instruments such as<br>
sequencers and computers.<br>

present invention is carried out using the image forming apparatus of the<br>
present invention is described with reference to Fig. 2. . The image<br>
forming apparatus 100 comprises a photoconductor drum 10 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a 'photoconductor 10') as the latent image bearing member,<br>
a charging roller 20 as the charging unit, an exposure apparatus 30 as<br>
the exposing unit, a developing section 40 as the developing unit, an<br>
intermediate transfer member 50, a cleaning apparatus 60 as the<br>
cleaning unit having a cleaning blade, and a neutralizing lamp 70 as the<br>
neutralizing unit.<br>
The intermediate transfer member 50 is an endless belt, and it is<br>
designed such that it moves in the arrow direction by three rollers 51<br>
which are disposed inside the belt and extend the belt. A part of the<br>
three rollers 51 works as a transfer bias roller capable of applying a<br>
given transfer bias (primary transfer bias) to the intermediate transfer<br>
member 50. A cleaning apparatus 90 having a cleaning blade is disposed<br>
in the vicinity of the intermediate transfer member 50, and a transfer<br>
roller 80 as the transferring unit capable of applying the transfer bias for<br>
transferring (secondary transfer) the developed image (toner image) to<br>
transfer paper 95 as the final recording medium is disposed in opposition<br>
to the intermediate transfer member 50.    Around the intermediate<br>
59<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
transfer member 50A, corona charging section 58 for electrically charging<br>
the toner image on the intermediate transfer member 50 is disposed in<br>
the rotating direction of the intermediate transfer member 50, between a<br>
contact portion of the photoco'nductor 10 with the intermediate transfer<br>
member 50 and a contact portion of the intermediate transfer member 50<br>
with the transfer paper 95.<br>
A developing section 40 is composed of a developing belt 41 as the<br>

In the image forming apparatus shown in Fig. 2, for example, the<br>
charging roller 20 uniformly charges the photoconductor drum 10. The<br>
exposing apparatus 30 exposes the photoconductor drum 10 according to<br>
the image to form the latent electrostatic image. The latent electrostatic<br>
image formed on the photoconductor drum 10 is developed using the<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
toner supplied from the developing section 40 to form a toner image. The<br>
toner image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the intermediate<br>
transfer member 50 and further transferred (secondary transfer) onto the<br>
transfer paper 95 by the voltage applied by the rollers 51. As a result, a<br>
transfer image is formed on the transfer paper 95. The toner left on the<br>
photoconductor 10 is removed by the cleaning apparatus 60, and the<br>
charge on the photoconductor 10 is once removed by the neutralizing<br>
lamp 70.<br>
Another aspect where the image forming method of the present<br>
invention is carried out by the image forming apparatus of the present<br>
invention is described with reference to Fig. 3. The image forming<br>
apparatus 100 shown in Fig. 3 has the same constitution and the same<br>

is set on a document table 130 in the automatic document feeder (ADF)<br>
400, or the automatic document feeder 400 is opened. A document is set<br>
on a contact glass 32 of the scanner 300, and, the automatic document<br>
feeder 400 is closed.<br>
When a start button (not shown in the figure) is pressed, the<br>
scanner 300 drives, and a first carriage 33 and a second carriage 34 run<br>
after the document is fed and moved onto the contact glass 32 in the case<br>
the document has been set in the automatic document feeder 400, or<br>
immediately in the case the document has been set on the contact glass<br>
32.	Here, a light is applied from a light source through the first carriage<br>
33,	and simultaneously the light reflected from the document surface is<br>
reflected by a mirror in the second carriage 34. A color document (color<br>
image) is read out from the light received in a reading sensor 36 through<br>
an image forming lens 35 to produce image information of black, yellow,<br>
magenta and cyan.<br>
Each image information of black, yellow, magenta and cyan is<br>
communicated to each image forming unit 18 (image forming unit for<br>

image forming unit for cyan) in the tandem developing section 120, and<br>
in each image forming unit, each of toner images of black, yellow,<br>
magenta and cyan is formed. That is, each image forming unit 18 (image<br>
forming unit for black, image forming unit for yellow, image forming unit<br>
for magenta and image forming unit for cyan) in the tandem developing<br>
section    120    comprises    the    following"    the    photoconductor    10<br>
63<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
(photoconductor   for   black    10K,    photoconductor   for   yellow   10Y,<br>
photoconductor for magenta 10M and photoconductor for cyan IOC); the<br>
charging section 60 which uniformly charges the photoconductor! the<br>
exposing section which exposes (L in Fig. 5) the photoconductor according<br>
to the image corresponding to each color image based on each color image<br>
information and forms a latent electrostatic image corresponding to each<br>
color image on the photoconductor; the developing section 61 which<br>
develops the latent electrostatic image using each color toner (black toner,<br>
yellow toner, magenta toner and cyan toner) to form a toner image by<br>
each   color   toner;   the   transferring   and   charging   section   62   for<br>
transferring the toner image onto the intermediate transferring member<br>
50; the photoconductor cleaning apparatus 63; and the neutralizing '<br>
section 64. Each image forming unit 18 can form an image of each single<br>
color (black image, yellow image, magenta image and cyan image) based<br>
on each color image information. The black image, the yellow image, the<br>
magenta image and the cyan image formed in this way are delivered to<br>
the intermediate transferring member 50 rotated by the support rollers<br>
14, 15 and 16, and the black image formed on the photoconductor for<br>
black 10K, the yellow image formed on the photoconductor for yellow 10Y,<br>

the   cyan  image  formed  on  the  photoconductor  for   cyan   10C  are<br>
sequentially transferred onto the intermediate transferring member 50<br>
(primary transfer). Then, a composite color image (color transfer image)<br>
is formed on the intermediate transferring member 50 by superimposing<br>
the black image, the yellow image, the magenta image and the cyan<br>

Meanwhile, in the paper supply table 200, one of paper supply-<br>
rollers 142 is selectively rotated to supply a sheet (recording paper) from<br>
one of multiple paper supply cassettes 144 provided in a paper bank 143.<br>
The sheet is separated by a separation roller 145 and fed to a paper<br>
supply path 146. It is then delivered by a feeding roller 147 to a paper<br>
supply path 148 in the main body 150 and stopped by hitting a resist<br>
roller 49. Alternatively, the sheet (recording paper) on a manual paper<br>
feeding tray 54 is supplied by rotating the paper supply roller 142, is<br>
separated by one by a separation roller 52 to place in a manual paper<br>
feeding paper supply path 53 and is also stopped by hitting the resist<br>
roller 49. The resist roller 49 is generally used grounded, but it may be<br>
used in a bias-applied state for removing paper powder on the sheet.<br>
Then, a color image is transferred and formed on the sheet (recording<br>
paper) by rotating the resist roller 49 at the same timing as the.<br>
composite color image made on the intermediate transferring member 50,<br>
which sends out the sheet between the intermediate transferring<br>
member 50 and the secondary transferring apparatus 22 and transfers<br>
the composite color image (color transfer image) onto the sheet (recording<br>
paper) by the secondary transferring apparatus 22. The toner left on the<br>
intermediate transferring member 50 after transferring the image is<br>
cleaned by an intermediate transferring member cleaning apparatus 17.<br>
The sheet (recording paper) on which the color image has been<br>
transferred and formed is delivered by the secondary transferring<br>
apparatus 22 and sent to the fixing apparatus 25, and the composite<br>
65<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
color image (color transfer image) is fixed on the sheet (recording paper)<br>
with heat and pressure in the fixing apparatus 25. Subsequently, the<br>
sheet (recording paper) is switched by a switch blade 55, discharged by a<br>
discharging roller 56 and stacked on a catch tray 57. Alternatively, the<br>
sheet is switched at a switch blade 55 and reversed by a reversing<br>
apparatus 28 to lead again to a transfer position, and an image is also<br>
recorded on a backside. Then, the sheet is discharged by the discharging<br>
roller 56 and stacked on the catch tray 57<br>
Fig. 11 is a schematic diagram showing one example of the image<br>
forming apparatus according to the present invention. The image<br>
forming apparatus 500 comprises a document reading part 520, an image<br>
forming part 530 and a paper supply part 540. In the image forming part<br>
530, a photoconductor 501 which is the latent image bearing member, a<br>
charging unit 502, an. exposing unit 503, a developing unit 504, a<br>
transferring unit 506, a fixing unit 507 and a cleaning unit 508 in the.<br>
periphery of the photoconductor 501 are disposed. The surface of the<br>
photoconductor 501 is uniformly charged by the charging unit 502, and<br>
then the latent electrostatic image is formed on the charged surface by<br>
exposure light of the exposing unit 503. The developer comprising the<br>
toner having the same polarity as the polarity of the formed latent image<br>
is supplied by the developing unit 504 to develop the latent image, which<br>
is then transferred to a delivered recording member such as paper by the<br>
transferring unit 506. The recording member is subsequently delivered<br>
to the fixing unit 507, and the toner is fixed on the recording member<br>
with hest and pressure. Meanwhile, the toner left on the photoconductor<br>
66<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
501 after transferring is removed, by the cleaning unit 508.<br>
The developer comprising the toner is used for the developing<br>
unit 504. In the developing unit 504, a developer bearing member 504a<br>
bears and delivers the developer, and the latent image on the<br>
photoconductor 501 is developed by applying the alternating electric field<br>
at an opposite position to the photoconductor 501. By applying the<br>
alternating electric field, it is possible to activate the developer, to<br>
narrow the charge distribution of the toner and to enhance the<br>
developing property.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, by finely controlling<br>
the surface characteristics of the toner base particles, it is possible to<br>
provide a toner and a developer which form a high quality image,<br>
simultaneously satisfying the discharging property, the developing<br>
property and the transfer property even when the toner which is<br>
excellent in dot reproducibility is minimized in particle size and made .<br>
spherical. In addition, a high-quality image with favorable cleaning<br>
stability over time, charge stability, developing property and transfer<br>
property as well as excellent reproducibility of fine dots may be provided<br>
by employing the.image forming apparatus comprising the developer<br>
with the toner of the present invention.<br>
The present invention will be further described with reference to<br>
the following examples, but these are not to be construed the present<br>
invention. Hereinafter, 'part' and '%' represent part by mass and % by<br>
mass, respectively..<br>

filtrated, washed with water and dried to yield a toner.<br>
The physical properties of the toner were evaluated as follows.<br><surface characteristics><br>
ERA-8800FE, manufactured by Elionix Co., Ltd., was used as a<br>
field emission electron beam three dimensional roughness analyzer. The<br>
toner was measured with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and no<br>
evaporation, and its surface characteristics were analyzed using an<br>
accessory software of the analyzer.<br>
Platinum (Pt) and the like are evaporated in general for<br>
measurement in order to prevent charge-up due to electron beams when<br>
an organic substance is measured by an FE-SEM. However, there is a<br>
possibility that the original surface characteristics may not be observed<br>
because of the platinum evaporation. Therefore, the measurement was<br>
conducted without the evaporation for prevention of charge-up. The low<br>
acceleration voltage at 5 kV as well as a short duration of the electron-<br>
beam irradiation successfully prevented the charge-up.<br>
A relationship of the surface roughness (Ra) with its standard<br>
deviation (RMS) obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples is<br>
shown in Fig. 6. From this result, it is found that the standard deviation<br>
103<br><br>
WO 2006/075534	PCT/JP2005/024210<br>
RMS is extremely small even when the surface roughness (Ra) is large in<br>
the toner of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 7 show an SEM photograph of the toner base particle of the<br>
toner in Example 1. Figs. 8 and 9 show the surface concavoconvex by 3D-<br>
SEM of the toner base particles of the toner in Example 1. Fig. 10 shows<br>
the quantitative results of the above roughness analysis for such toner<br>
base particles. From these figures, it is understood that the toner<br>
surface is remarkably concavo-convex because the toner is produced by<br>
dissolution/dispersion of the toner material comprising an inorganic<br>
particulate using the organic solvent and granulation in the aqueous<br>
medium followed by desolvation.<br><circularity><br>

been previously removed was placed, 0.1 mL to 0.5 mL of a surfactant<br>
was added as a dispersant, and further about 0.1 g to 9.5 g of a sample to<br>
be measured was added. A suspension in which the sample had been<br>
dispersed was dispersed for about one minute to three minutes using an<br>
