				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an ink concentrate.<br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of an ink concentrate, i.e., dispersion of an organic pigment in an ink vehicle, particularly a printing ink vehicle, comprising a solvent and, optionally, other components such as a binder and additives, which dispersion contains 20-80% by weight of the pigment and can be "let down", i.e. diluted, to give a final printing ink by the addition of further ink vehicle.<br>
Conventional processes for the production of inks or ink concentrates containing metal phthalocyanine pigments have required the crude metal phthalocyanine to be subjected to prolonged grinding in a ball mill or kneader in the presence of an inorganic salt followed by further conditioning and isolation to convert the crude metal phthalocyanine into a pigmentary from, which is then dispersed, usually with further grinding, in an ink vehicle. In WO 95/17473 it has been proposed to prepare ink concentrates by milling crude copper phthalocyanine in an organic ink solvent; the proposed process requires the use of a specialized dispersing agent and a specialised fluidizing agent.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that ink concentrates containing pigmnetary metal phthalocyanine can be obtained without the need for prolonged grinding and without the need to use specialized dispersing and fluidizing agents by firstly milling crude metal phthalocyanine to reduce its particle size and then kneading the smaller particles of crude metal phthalocyanine together with a solvent component of the ink and, optionally, a binder component of the ink. Possible environmental problems associated with the use of an inorganic salt grinding aid can thereby be avoided and the overall processing time required to progress from crude metal phthalocyanine to ink concentrate can be considerably reduced. Printing inks having excellent dispersion, strength, gloss and flow properties can be obtained from the resulting concentrates.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of an ink concentrate which comprises<br>
(a)	milling in a ball mill, an attritor or a grinding apparatus having a<br>
similar effect a crude copper, zinc or nickel phthalocyanine, or chlorinated<br>
and/or brominated copper phthalocyanine to reduce the particle size thereof,<br>
thereby forming a modified crude metal phthalocyanine and<br>
(b)	kneading in a batch kneader or extruder a mixture of the modified<br>
crude metal phthalocyanine together with an ink vehicle of the kind as herein<br>
described, the metal phthalocyanine being present in an amount of 30 to 70%<br>
by weight of the kneaded mixture, to give an ink concentrate containing the<br>
metal phthalocyanine in pigmentary form dispersed in the ink vehicle, wherein<br>
the shear gradient applied during the kneading step(b) is from 300 to 20000 S-1,<br>
the kneading temperature is from 20 to 200°C and the ink vehicle comprises<br>
from 0.1  to  50%  of a binder selected from the group  consisting of rosin,<br>
polymerized rosins,  phenolic-modified rosins,  maleic  modified rosins,  alkyd<br>
resins, hydrocarbon resins and acrylic resins and from 0.1 to 100% by weight,<br>
preferably from 15 to 50 % by weight, based on the weight of the crude metal<br>
phthalocyanine, of one or more aliphatic alcohols having at least  12 carbon<br>
atoms and/or aliphatic carboxylic acids having at least 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The milling step (a) is preferably carried out in a ball mill, although other grinding apparatus having a similar effect, for example an attritor, can be used if desired. In the milling step, the crude metal phthalocyanine is preferably in admixture with a resin and / or an organic liquid. The resin may be a resin conventionally used as a resin or binder component of a printing ink concentrate, or a resin compatible with such a component and other components of the ink concentrate to be produced. Examples of suitable resins, where the ink concentrate to be produced is an oil-based concentrate, are rosins, including phenolic-modified rosins and maleic-modified rosins, alkyd resins, hydrocarbon resins and mixtures of two or more thereof, with phenolic-modified rosins and maleic-modified rosins being preferred. Where the ink concentrate to be produced is an aqueous concentrate, water-compatible resins such as acrylic resins are usually more suitable. Where a resin is used in the milling step (a), it is usually in particulate form.Organic liquids suitable for use in the milling step (a) may be those conventionally used as a solvent component of a printing ink concentrate, or a liquid compatible with such a component. The liquid may be a material which is solid at ambient temperature but is liquid at the elevated temperature resulting from the milling process. Suitable liquids include long chain aliphatic alcohols, i.e. those having at leat 12 carbon atoms, for example 12 to 20 carbon atoms, such as lauryl alcohol (dodecyl alcohol), tridecanol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, margaryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and oleyl alcohol and aliphatic carboxylic acids having at least 4 carbon atoms, for example 4 to 20 carbon atoms, such as butyric acid, hexanoic acid, n-octanoic acid, 2-ehtylhexanoic acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, lauric acid, mysristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid. Especially preferred organic liquids are cetyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol and 2-ehtylhexanoic acid.<br>
A fluidizing agent may be milled together with the crude metal phthalocyanine in the milling step (a). Suitable fluidizing agents includes salts of long chain aliphatic amines, e.g. those having one or more chains of at least 10 carbon atoms, e.g. 10 to 20 carbon atoms, with a sulphonated metal phthalocyanine, especially sulphonated copper phthalocyanine.<br>
The modified crude metal phthalocyanine produced by the milling step (a) generally has particle sizes from 5 to 50 microns, compared with about 10 to 100 microns for the crude phthalocyanine before milling. The percentage of the phthalocyanine in the beta crystal form is generally reduced by the milling, although to a lesser extent when an organic liquid is milled with the phthalocyanine. The milled product generally has the characteristics of a ball milled intermediate.<br>
Where a resin is used in the milling stage (a), it may be used generally in an amount of 0.1 to 50%, preferably 2 to 30%, especially 5 to 15%, by weight of the crude metal phthalocyanine. When an organic liquid is used in the milling stage (a) it is used in an amount, generally 0.1 to 20% by weight of the crude phthalocyanine, such that the product of the milling stage (a) is in particulate form, not caked or wet form.<br>
The kneading step (b) of the process of the invention may be carried out in a batch kneader or, preferably, an extruder, especially a twin-screw extruder which may have, for example, 1 to 30 mixing zones, more usually 3 to 20 mixing zones. The modified crude metal phthalocyanine obtained by the milling step (a) may be fed to an extruder in admixture with the ink vehicle, or the ink vehicle may be fed separately to the extruder. The ink vehicle may consist wholly of an organic liquid as hereinbefore described as suitable for use in milling step (a), i.e. a liquid conventionally used as a solvent component of a printing ink concentrate or a liquid compatible with such a component, where such liquid is a liquid at ambient temperature. Alternatively, the ink vehicle may comprise one or more ink solvents, for example one or more organic liquids as hereinbefore described, optionally together with one or more ink binders and, optionally also, other known components of ink vehicles such as conventional additives.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of step (b) the modified crude metal phthalocyanine obtained by the milling step (a) is fed to an extruder together with an organic liquid such as one or more of those hereinbefore described as usable in the milling step (a). In another preferred embodiment, the modified crude metal phthalocyanine obtained by the milling step (a) and the organic liquid are fed separately to the extruder. In both embodiments, any remaining part of the ink vehicle is preferably supplied to the extruder through one inlet before the, or the first, mixing zone.<br>
The ink solvent component of the ink vehicle may be used in step (b) in an amount of 0.1 to 100%, preferably 15 to 50% by weight, based on the weight of the metal phthalocyanine. The temperature at which the kneading step (b) is carried out, e.g. the barrel temperature of the extruder, may be generally from 20 to 200 °C, preferably from 50 to 150°C. The shear gradient applied to the materials to be extruded may be adjusted by adjusting the screw speed. This shear gradient is generally from 300 to 20,000s "1, preferably 500 to 5000s "1.<br>
The nature of the solvent, binder and other components of the ink vehicle is determined generally by the type of ink concentrate which it is desired to produce. The process of the invention may be used to produce concentrates for printing inks of various types, for example lithographic, letterpress, flexographic gravure and serigraphic inks, which may be based on organic or aqueous solvents.<br>
Amongst the solvents which may be used are one or more of the following : alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanols and butanols, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane and high boiling mineral oils known as printing ink distillates, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, esters such as ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, amyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, glycol ethers such as 2-ethoxyethanol and 2-n-butoxyethanol and ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone.<br>
Amongst the binders which may be used are one or more of the following: rosins, including polymerised rosins, phenolic-modified rosins and maleic modified rosins, usually in admixture with a plasticizing thermoplastic resin, alkyd resins, acrylic polymers, nitrocelluloses, polyamides, polystyrenes and epoxy resins.Examples of other known components of ink vehicles which may be kneaded with the phthalocyanine in step (b) or added during subsequent processing of the ink concentrate are drying oils, driers, waxes, antioxidants, surfactants, other pigments, particularly white pigments such as titanium dioxide, stabilisers and, especially, dispersing agents and fluidising agents. Preferred dispersing agents are long chain carboxylic acids, particularly poly(hydroxycarboxylic acids) and their salts. Preferred fluidising agents are salts of long chain, aliphatic amines i.e. those with one or more chains of at least 10 carbon atoms, e.g.10 to 20 carbon atoms, with a sulphonated metal phthalocyanine, particularly sulphonated copper phthalocyanine.<br>
In the kneading step (b), the relative amounts of the modified crude metal phthalocyanine from the milling step (a) and the ink vehicle with which it is kneaded may be such that the kneaded mixture, and therefore the ink concentrate produced, contains from 20 to 80%, preferably 30 to 70%, especially 40 to 60%, by weight of metal phthalocyanine. The product of the kneading step is an ink concentrate containing the metal phthalocyanine in pigmentary form, predominantly in the beta crystal form. The concentrate may be let down, ie. diluted, with further ink vehicle to give a final ink or an intermediate let-down product which can be supplied as a feeding stock to an inkmaker and further diluted with ink vehicle to give the final ink. The let-down of the concentrate can be carried out using conventional procedures.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly useful for the preparation of ink concentrates where the metal phthalocyanine is copper phthalocyanine, but may also be used for the production of ink concentrates containing other metal phthalocyanines, for example zinc or nickel phthalocyanine, or chlorinated and/or brominated copper phthalocyanine.<br>
The process of the invention may be used to produce ink concentrates for printing inks of various types, including lithographic inks, offset inks, letterpress inks, aqueous inks and publication gravure inks.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples, in which parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise specified.<br>
Example 1<br>

and/or brominated copper phthalocyanine to reduce the particle size thereof,<br>
thereby forming a modified crude metal phthalocyanine and<br>
(b)	kneading in a batch kneader or extruder a mixture of the modified<br>
crude metal phthalocyanine together with an ink vehicle of the kind as herein<br>
described, the metal phthalocyanine being present in an amount of 30 to 70%<br>
by weight of the kneaded mixture, to give an ink concentrate containing the<br>
metal phthalocyanine in pigmentary form dispersed in the ink vehicle, wherein<br>
the shear gradient applied during the kneading step(b) is from 300 to 20000 s-1<br>
the kneading temperature is from 20 to 200°C and the ink vehicle comprises<br>
from 0.1   to  50%  of a binder selected from the group  consisting of rosin,<br>
polymerized rosins,  phenolic-modified rosins,  maleic modified rosins,   alkyd<br>
resins, hydrocarbon resins and acrylic resins and from 0.1 to 100% by weight,<br>
preferably from 15 to 50 % by weight, based on the weight of the crude metal<br>
phthalocyanine, of one or more aliphatic alcohols having at least 12 carbon<br>
atoms and/or aliphatic carboxylic acids having at least 4 carbon atoms.<br>
2.        A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the kneading step (b) is carried out in a twin-screw extruder.<br>
3.	A   process   for   the   preparation   of  a  printing   ink,   wherein   an   ink<br>
concentrate obtained by a process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 is let down by the<br>
addition of further ink vehicle.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the ink concentrate is let down<br>
to an intermediate product which is then further diluted with ink vehicle to give<br>
the printing ink.<br>
5.	A process for the preparation of an ink concentrate substantially as<br>
hereinbefore described with reference to the foregoing examples.<br></td>
