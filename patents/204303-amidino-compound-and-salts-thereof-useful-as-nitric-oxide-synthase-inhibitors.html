BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to amidino compounds useful as nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.<br>
Related Art<br>
It has been known since the early 1980's that the vascular relaxation caused by acetylcholine is dependent on the vascular endothelium. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), now known to be nitric oxide (NO) is generated In the vascular endothelium by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The activity of NO as a vasodilator has been known for well over 100 years. In addition, NO is the active species deriving from amylnitrite, glyceryltrinitrate and other nitrovasodilators. The identification of EDRF as NO has coincided with the discovery of a biochemical pathway by which NO is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzyme NO synthase.<br>
Nitric oxide is an endogenous stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase. In addition to endothelium-dependent relaxation, NO is involved in a number of biological actions including cytotoxicity of phagocytic cells and cell-to-celi communication in the central nervous system.<br>
There are at least three types of NO synthase as follows: (i)     a  constitutive,  Ca++/calmodulin  dependent enzyme,  located  in  the endothelium, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.<br>
(ii)   a constitutive, Ca++/calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the brain, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.<br>
(iii) a Ca++ independent enzyme which is induced after activation of vascular smooth muscle, macrophages, endothelial cells, and a number of other cells by endotoxin and cytokines. Once expressed this inducible nitric oxide synthase (hereinafter "iNOS") generates NO continuously for long periods.<br><br>
The NO released by each of the two constitutive enzymes acts as a transduction mechanism underlying several physiological responses. The NO produced by the inducible enzyme is a cytotoxic molecule for tumor cells and invading microorganisms. It also appears that adverse effects of excess NO production, in particular pathological vasodilation and tissue damage, may result largely from the NO synthesized by iNOS.<br>
There is a growing body of evidence that NO may be involved in the degeneration of cartilage which takes place as a result of certain conditions such as arthritis and it is also known that NO synthesis is increased in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoarthritis.<br>
Some of the NO synthase inhibitors proposed for therapeutic use are nonselective; they inhibit both the constitutive and the inducible NO synthases. Use of such a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor requires that great care be taken in order to avoid the potentially serious consequences of over-inhibition of the constitutive NO-synthase including hypertension and possible thrombosis and tissue damage. In particular, in the case of the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of toxic shock it has been recommended that the patient must be subject to continuous blood pressure monitoring throughout the treatment. Thus, while non-selective NO synthase inhibitors have therapeutic utility provided that appropriate precautions are taken, NO synthase inhibitors which are selective in the sense that they inhibit the inducible NO synthase to a considerably greater extent than the constitutive isoforms of NO synthase would be of even greater therapeutic benefit and easier to use (S. Moncada and E. Higgs, FASEB J., 9, 1319-1330, 1995).<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds have now been found which have the advantage of being very efficacious as iNOS inhibitors in the human cartilage explant assay, a model for osteoarthritis. At the same time, the compounds of the present invention are surprisingly unable to penetrate certain non-target organs in test systems, especially in comparison to the compounds of WO 95/25717. This surprising differentiation in expected access between the target organ (cartilage) and other organs is an unexpected advantage for the compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
In a broad aspect, the present invention is directed to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using said compounds and compositions for inhibiting or modulating nitric oxide synthesis in a subject in need of such inhibition or modulation by administering a compound which preferentially inhibits or modulates the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase over the constitutive isoforms of nitric oxide synthase. It is also another object of the present invention to lower nitric oxide levels in a subject in need of such lowering. The present compounds possess useful nitric oxide synthase inhibiting activity, and are expected to be useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition in which the synthesis or over-synthesis of nitric oxide forms a contributory part.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors of formula 5-[2-[(l-Iminoethyl)amino]ethyl]-2-methyM-cysteine, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>

Biological Data<br>
Some or all of the following assays are used to demonstrate the nitric oxide synthase inhibitory activity of the invention's compounds as well as demonstrate the useful pharmacological properties.<br>
Citrulline Assay for Nitric Oxide Synthase<br>
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity can be measured by monitoring the conversion of L-[2,3-3H]-arginine to L-[2,3-3H]-citrulline (Bredt and Snyder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 87, 682-685, 1990 and Moore et al, J. Med. Chem.. 39, 669-672, 1996). Human inducible NOS (hiNOS), human endothelial constitutive NOS (hecNOS) and human neuronal constitutive NOS (hncNOS) are each cloned from RNA extracted from human tissue. The cDNA for human inducible NOS (hiNOS) is isolated from a DcDNA library made from RNA extracted from a colon sample from a patient with ulcerative colitis.   The cDNA for human endothelial constitutive NOS<br><br>
(hecNOS) is isolated from a DcDNA library made from RNA extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the cDNA for human neuronal constitutive NOS (hncNOS) is isolated from a DcDNA library made from RNA extracted from human cerebellum obtained from a cadaver. The recombinant enzymes are expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector (Rodi et al, in The Biology of Nitric Oxider Pt. 4: Enzymologyf Biochemistry and Immunology; Moncada, S., Feelisch, M., Busse, R., Higgs, E., Eds.; Portland Press Ltd.: London, 1995; pp 447-450). Enzyme activity is isolated from soluble cell extracts and partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. To measure NOS activity, 10 pL of enzyme is added to 40 pL of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6) in the presence or absence of test compounds and the reaction initiated by the addition of 50 pL of a reaction mixture containing 50mM Tris (pH 7.6), 2,0 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 2.0 mM DTT, 4.0 mM CaCl2/ 20 pM FAD, 100 pM tetrahydrobiopterin, 0.4 mM<br>
NADPH and 60 pM L-arginine containing 0.9 pCi of L-[2,3- H]-arginine. The final concentration of L-arginine in the assay is 30 pM. For hecNOS or hncNOS, calmodulin is included at a final concentration of 40-100 nM. Following incubation at 37°C for 15 minutes, the reaction is terminated by addition of 400 pL of a suspension (1 part resin, 3 parts buffer) of Dowex 50W X-8 cation exchange resin in a stop buffer containing 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM HEPES, pH 5.5 and 1 mM L-citrulline. After mixing the resin is allowed to settle and L-[2,3-3H]-Citrulline formation is determined by counting aliquots of the supernatant with a liquid scintillation counter. Results are reported in Table 1 as the IC50 values of compounds for hiNOS, hecNOS<br>
and hncNOS.<br>
In Vivo Assay<br>
Rats can be treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 1-12.5 mg/kg of endotoxin (LPS) with or without oral administration of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Plasma nitrite/nitrate levels can be determined 5 hours post-treatment. The results can be used to show that the administration of the nitric oxide synthase<br><br>
inhibitors decreases the rise in plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, a reliable indicator of the production of nitric oxide induced by endotoxin.<br>
Raw Cell Nitrite Assay<br>
RAW 264.7 cells can be plated to confluency on a 96-well tissue culture plate grown overnight (17h) in the presence of LPS to induce NOS. A row of 3-6 wells can be left untreated and served as controls for subtraction of nonspecific background. The media can be removed from each well and the cells washed twice with Kreb-Ringers-Hepes (25 mM, pH 7.4) with 2 mg/ml glucose. The cells are then placed on ice and incubated with 50 pL of buffer containing L-arginine (30 pM) +/- inhibitors for lh. The assay can be initiated by warming the plate to 37° C in a water bath for Ih. Production of nitrite by intracellular iNOS will be linear with time. To terminate the cellular assay, the plate of cells can be placed on ice and the nitrite-containing buffer removed and analyzed for nitrite using a previously published fluorescent determination for nitrite. T. P. Misko et al, Analytical Biochemistry, 214, 11-16 (1993).<br>
Human cartilage explant assay<br>
Bone pieces are rinsed twice with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (GibcoBRL) and once with Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (GibcoBRL) and placed into a petri dish with phenol red free Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (GibcoBRL). Cartilage was cut into small explants of approximately 15-45 mg in weight and one or two explants per well are placed into either 96 or 48 well culture plates with 200-500 pL of culture media per well. The culture media was either a custom modification of Minimum Essential Medium(Eagle) with Earle's salts (GibcoBRL) prepared without L-Arginine, without L-Glutamine'ancTwi'thbiit' phenol red or a custom modification of serumless Neuman and Tytell (GibcoBRL) medium prepared without L-arginine, without insulin, without ascorbic acid, without L-glutamine and without phenol red. Both are supplemented before use with 100 pM L-Arginine (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine, IX HL-1 supplement (BioWhittaker), 50<br><br>
mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma) and 150 pg/ml recombinant human IL-ID (RD Systems) to induce nitric oxide synthase. Compounds are then added in 10 pL aliquots and the explants incubated at 37° C with 5% CO2 for 18-24 hours. The day old supernatant is then discarded and replaced with fresh culture media containing recombinant human IL-ID and compound and incubated for another 20-24 hours. This supernatant is analyzed for nitrite with a fluorometric assay (Misko et al, Anal. Biochem., 214, 11-16, 1993). All samples are done in quadruplicate. Unstimulated controls are cultured in media in the absence of recombinant human IL-ID. IC50 values (Table 1) are determined from plotting the percent inhibition of nitrite production at six different concentrations of inhibitor.<br>
