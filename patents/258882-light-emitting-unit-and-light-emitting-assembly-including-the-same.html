LIGHT  EMITTING   UNIT  AND   LIGHT  EMITTING ASSEMBLY INCLUDING THE SAME;<br><br><br>
QUAN MEI TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF TAIWAN, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 1F., NO. 250, YONGHUA RD.P YONGKANG CITY, TAINAN COUNTY, TAIWAN<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a light emitting unit and a light emitting as sembly, more particularly to a light emitting unit including a 1ight-mounting seat laving a part for clamping of a pair of leads of a Lightemittingdevice.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate a conventional light emitting assembly 1 for a lighting apparatus, such as a warning light. The conventional: light emitting assembly 1 includes a plurality of light emitting ievices 13 (only one is shown), each of which has a pair of leads 132 (only one is shown), a circuit board 12 formed with a plurality of lead-inserting holes 121 (only one is shown) for extension of the leads 132 of the light emitting devices 13 therethrough, respectively, and a reflective cover 11 mounted on the circuit board 12 and formed with a plurality of through-holes 111 (only one is shown) for extension  of the light emitting devices 13, respectively.<br>
When the light emitting assembly 1 is assembled, the light emitting devices 13 extend through the through-holes 111 of. the reflective cover 11, and the leads 132 of the light emitting devices 13 extend through the lead-inserting holes 121 of the circuit board 12 and are soldered to the circuit board 12. Since each of the light emitting devices 13 is merely<br>
2<br><br>
secured on the circuit board 12 through solder material bonded to the leads 132 thereof and the circuit board 12, the leads 132 of each of the light emitting devices 13 tend to separate from the solder material due to vibration, thereby resulting in disconnection of the light emitting devices 13 from the circuit board 12.<br>
In addition, since the reflective cover 11 is relatively irregular in shape, assembly of the same with the light emitting devices 13 and the circuit board 12 is relatively difficult to corduct.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a light emitting unit that can overcome the aforesaid drawbacks associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a light emitting as sembly that can overcome the aforesaid drawbacks associated with.the prior art..<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a light emitting unit that comprises: a light-mounting seat having a first part and a second part protruding from the first part; and a light emitting diode having a pair of leads clamping the second part of the light-mounting seat.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a light emitting assembly that comprises: a plurality of light emitting units, each of which includes a light-mounting seat having a first part and a second part protruding from said<br><br>
first part, and a light emitting device having a pair of leads clamping the second part of the light-mounting seat; and a circuit board having a plurality of mounting regions, each of which is formed with a pair of lead-inserting holes for extension of the leads of the light emitting device of a respective one of the light emitting units therethrough.<br>

Figs.3 and 4 illustrate the first preferred embodiment of a light emitting assembly according to this invention. The light emitting assembly includes a circuit board 5 and a plurality of light emitting units (only one is shown) mounted on the circuit board 5 .<br>
Each of the light emitting units includes a 1ight-mounting seat 2 having a first part 21 and a second part 22 protruding from the first part 21, and a light emitting device 3 having a pair of leads 32 clamping the second part 22 of the light-mounting seat 2 .<br>
Preferably, the first part 21 is in a shape of<br><br>
a pyramid.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the first and second parts 21, 22 has a top 211, 221 and a bottom 212, 222. The first part 21 has a first leg 23 extending downwardly from the bottom 212 of the first part 21. The second part 22 has a second leg 2 4 extending downwardly from the bottom 222 of the second part 22.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the first and second legs 23, 24 has a hook end 231, 241.<br>
In this embodiment, the first part 21 has a first protrusion 25 extending upwardly from the top 211 of the first part 21, and the second part 22 has a second protrusion 26 extending upwardly from the top 221 of the second part 22.<br>
In this embodiment, the first part 21 has two opposite ends 213, 214. The first leg 23 of the first part 21 is disposed between the ends 213, 214 of the first part 21. The second part 22 extends from the first part 21 in a transverse direction relative to the first part 21. The first and second legs 23, 24 are aligned in the transverse direction.<br>
In this embodiment, the first and second parts 21, 22 are transverse to each other and cooperatively define a T-shaped top surface (i.e., :he tops 211, 221 of first and second parts 21, 22) and two opposite corners 27, 28 at an intersection therebetween. The light emitting device 3 is seated on the T-shaped top<br>
6<br><br>
surface and has a flange portion 3 3 radiating therefrom and confined by the first and second protrusions 25, 26 of the first and second parts 21, 22 so as to prevent undesired wobbling of the light emitting device 3 when the light emitting assembly vibrates. The leads 32 of the light emitting device 3 are disposed at the corners 27, 28, respectively. As such, the light emitting device 3 is secured firmly to the light-mounting seat 2 through abutment with the first and second protrusions 25, 26 of the first and second parts 21, 22 and clamping action of the leads 32 of the light emitting device 3 on the second part 22.<br>
In this embodiment, the T-shaped top surface of the mounting seat 2 is inclined relative to the circuit boa rd 5 .<br>
In this embodiment, the circuit board 5 has a plurality of mounting regions 51, each of which is formed with a pair of lead-inserting holes 511 for extension of the leads 32 of the light emitting device 3 of a respective one of the light emitting units therethrough.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the mounting regions 51 of the circuit board 5 is further formed with a first leg-insert ing hole 512 and a second leg-inserting hole 513 for extension of the first and second legs 23, 24 therethrough, respectively. The hook ends 231, 241.of the first and second legs 23,<br>
7'<br><br>
2 4 are in snap engagement with peripheries of the first and second leg-inserting holes 512, 513 in a respective one of the mounting regions 51 of the circuit board 5 .<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the second preferred embodiment of the light emitting assembly according to the present invention. The second preferred embodiment differs from the previous embodiment in that the first part 21 further has a middle 215 between the ends 213, 214, and a pair of first legs 23 extending downwardly from the bottom 212 of the first part 21 and disposed at the ends 213, 214, respectively. The second part 22 extends from the middle 215 of the first part 21 in a transverse direction relative to the first part 21.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the mounting regions 51 of the circuit board 5 is formed with a pair of first leg-inserting holes 512 for extension of the first legs 23 of the first part 21 therethrough.<br>
As shown in Figs.7 and 8, the third preferred embodiment of the light emitting assembly according to the present invention further includes a cover 7 mounted on the circuit board 5 and formed with a plurality of through-holes 71 for extension of the light emitting devices 3 therethrough, respectively. Note that a portion of the light-mounting seats 2 has the same structure as that of the first preferred<br><br>
embodiment, and the remainder has the same structure as that of the second preferred embodiment.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates the fourth preferred embodiment of the light emitting assembly according to the present invention. The fourti preferred embodiment differs from the previous embodiments in that the T-shaped top surface of the light-mounting seat 2 is parallel to the circuit board 5.<br>
With the inclusion of the light-mounting seat<br>
2	in each.light emitting unit of this light emitting assembly of the invention, the light emitting device<br>
3	of each light emitting unit can be firmly supported on the circuit board 5, thereby preventing the undesired wobbling of the light emitting device on<br>
. the circuit board 5, and the assembly of the cover 7 with the light emitting devices 3 and the circuit board 5 is facilitated, thereby eliminating the aforesaid assembly problem encountered in the conventional light emitting assembly.<br>
