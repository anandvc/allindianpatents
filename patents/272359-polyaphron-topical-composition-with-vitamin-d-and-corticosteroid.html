				<td>POLYAPHRON TOPICAL COMPOSITION WITH VITAMIN D AND CORTICOSTEROID<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for topical application comprising at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid.<br>
It is known for compositions comprising vitamin D or vitamin D analogues to be used for the treatment of a number of skin conditions.<br>
For example, EP-B-474,517 discloses the use of compositions containing one or more 1α-hydroxylated-19-nor-vitamin D compounds with a triple bond in the side chain in the treatment of psoriasis.<br>
US 4,871,723 discloses a process for treating psoriasis by topically applying a composition comprising vitamin D and a wax carrier.; Specifically, US 4,871,723 discloses a composition comprising a) a pharmaceutically effective amount of an active-type vitamin D3, b) a solvent selected from fatty acid esters, higher alcohols with 10 or more carbons and propylene carbonate and c) an oily carrier selected from white vaseline, yellow vaseline and liquid paraffin.<br>
US 2005/002546 A1 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active vitamin D compound in emulsion pre-concentrate formulations, as well as emulsions and sub-micron droplet emulsions produced therefrom. In particular, the pharmaceutical compositions of US 2005/002546 A1 comprise<br>
(a)	a lipophilic phase component;<br>
(b)	one or more surfactants; and<br>
(c)	an active vitamin D compound.<br>
The surfactant or surfactants are suitably present in an amount of 1% to 90% by weight based on the total weight<br>
 <br>
of the composition, and preferably from about 5% to about 85% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Presently available compositions contain relatively high concentrations of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues and surfactants which often lead to skin irritation and worsening of psoriasis. For example, in 1996 the Food and Drug Administration of America required that the label included in Dovonex (calcipotriene)- a product containing 0.005% calcipotriol - be amended to indicate that approximately 25% of patients experienced skin irritation, and approximately 10% worsening of psoriasis. In addition, it has been reported that some patients treated with Dovonex have developed hypercalcaemia (see, for example, Hardman KA, Heath DA, Nelson HM Hypercalcaemia associated with calcipotriol (Dovonex) treatment. BMJ. 1993 Apr 3;306(6882):896-896).<br>
Further, it is known in the prior art to treat a number of skin conditions by applying a combination of two or more pharmacologically active compounds. For example, in the treatment of psoriasis, it is possible to use a combination treatment involving a vitamin D analogue, such as calcipotriol, and a corticosteroid, where each of the active compounds is formulated in a separate preparation (for example in US-B-6,753,013).<br>
Topical pharmaceutical compositions comprising a combination of a vitamin D analogue and a topical corticosteroid are challenging to manufacture. This is because these compounds are stable at different pH values.<br>
For example, the calcipotriol requires a pH value above 8 for maximum stability, whereas corticosteroids, such as betamethasone (9-fluoro-ll, 17,2.1-trihydroxy-16-methylpregna-l,4-diene-3,20-dione), require pH values in the range 4 to 6 for maximum stability. It is therefore difficult to combine<br>
 <br>
the two active components in a single formulation while maintaining good stability of the active compounds if water is present in the formulation.<br>
US-B-6,753,013 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for dermal use, which contains at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue, at least one corticosteroid and a solvent selected to enable the two active components to coexist without significant degradation, despite their different stability profiles. The compositions, however, are wax-based and include wax or similar excipients, such as soft white paraffin and paraffin liquid. A disadvantage of this composition is that, in order to mix the vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and the corticosteroid into the wax, the wax must be heated to a temperature of 70°C. Such elevated temperatures may damage the drugs in the composition. Furthermore, wax based compositions tend to be rather oily, which after application leave a greasy film on the skin. This is undesirable and can lead to patient non-compliance.<br>
A further disadvantage of the compositions of US-B-6,753,013 is that in order for the compositions to provide beneficial results in topical treatment, high levels of vitamin D or vitamin D analogue are required in order for sufficient vitamin D or vitamin D analogue to permeate the skin. This is because the compositions exhibit poor diffusion through skin. This is disadvantageous as vitamin D and vitamin D analogues are known skin irritants.<br>
There is a need to formulate an improved composition suitable for topical application which addresses at least some of the problems of the prior art.<br>
The present inventors have now developed a new composition comprising at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid. The present inventors have surprisingly found that such compositions<br>
 <br>
have an enhanced dermal diffusion rate and/or improved stability compared to known compositions. Such compositions also have an appropriate viscosity such that they are useful for topical application.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition suitable for topical application comprising a continuous phase and at least one discontinuous phase, said composition comprising at least one polyaphron dispersion, at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition as described herein for use in the treatment of psoriasis.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition as described herein for use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of psoriasis.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition as described herein for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br>
According to a further aspect there is provided a method of treatment or prophylaxis of psoriasis in a subject which comprises topically applying to a subject an effective amount of a composition as herein described.<br>
In the following description, the meaning of the terms used are as follows: by hydrophilic phase or solvent is meant a liquid phase comprising water, comprising water together with other water-miscible liquids, or comprising a non-aqueous liquid which is miscible with water. By hydrophobic phase or solvent is meant a phase comprising pharmaceutically acceptable liquids such as oils that are immiscible or substantially immiscible with the hydrophilic<br>
 <br>
phase. By immiscible liquids is meant that when mixed together, they separate to form two distinctly separate liquid phases sharing a well-defined interface. By substantially immiscible is meant that two liquids mixed as above having a well defined interface between two phases where each phase may nevertheless contain small quantities of dissolved molecules of the other phase.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of making the composition as described herein comprising the following steps:<br>
(i) providing a hydrophilic solvent, optionally<br>
comprising at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue, and/or at least one corticosteroid, and/or a surfactant; (ii) providing a hydrophobic solvent optionally<br>
comprising at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue, and/or at least one corticosteroid, and/or a surfactant; (iii)mixing the hydrophilic solvent with the<br>
hydrophobic solvent under suitable conditions to form the composition comprising at least one polyaphron dispersion, at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of making the composition as described herein comprising the following steps:<br>
preparing a first polyaphron dispersion comprising a vitamin D or vitamin D analogue;<br>
preparing a second polyaphron dispersion comprising a corticosteroid;<br>
and mixing together said first and second polyaphron dispersions to form the composition.<br>
 <br>
Advantageously, the compositions of the present invention have an enhanced dermal permeation of the active agent compared to known compositions, such as those disclosed in US-B-6,753,013. Thus, lower levels of active agents may be required in the compositions of the present invention in order to achieve beneficial treatment results. As a result of having lower levels of vitamin D and/or vitamin D analogues in the compositions of the present invention the likelihood of causing skin irritation and/or other side-effects is reduced. This may have the effect of increasing patient compliance with the dosage regime. Advantageously, in the compositions of the present invention the vitamin D and/or vitamin D analogue and the corticosteroid can co-exist in an aqueous composition, having the appropriate and controllable viscosity due to the presence of polyaphron dispersions together with any gelling agents included in the composition. A further particular advantage is that the compositions have good long term stability even at elevated temperature (40°C). Furthermore, the presence of water in the compositions may be useful for dissolving water-soluble additives such as water-soluble preservatives, antioxidants, water-soluble permeation enhancers and the like.<br>
A further advantage is that compositions of the present invention are typically manufactured at room temperature without the need to apply heat, making it less likely that actives will be damaged in the composition.<br>
A further advantage of the present composition is that it feels less greasy in use compared to, for example, the compositions of US-B-6,753,013, making it more pleasant to apply and thereby increasing the likelihood of proper patient compliance.<br>
 <br>
Advantageously the composition of the present invention has low antrophogenic potential (i.e. preferably use of this compound when applied to the skin causes less skin thinning compared to prior art compositions).<br>
A yet further advantage of the composition of the present invention is that it need not comprise a high level of surfactant. In high concentrations surfactants are known to cause skin irritation. It is therefore desirable to keep the surfactant level to a minimum when applied to skin, and in particular to damaged skin such as in the case of psoriasis. Preferably the compositions of the present invention comprise less than 4% by weight of surfactant, more preferably less than 3%, more preferably still less than 2% by weight of the total composition.<br>
By polyaphron dispersion as used herein is meant a particular kind of hydrophilic liquid-in-hydrophobic liquid or hydrophobic liquid-in-hydrophilic liquid dispersion comprising (a) a hydrophilic liquid miscible phase, (b) a second hydrophobic phase being immiscible or substantially immiscible with the first phase and (c) one or more surfactants, wherein the dispersed or discontinuous phase is in the form of small (e.g. micron to sub-micron diameter, but more usually at least i micron diameter) droplets, and the whole having the following characteristics, which distinguish polyaphron dispersions from conventional or common emulsions and other dispersion types:<br>
1. They are capable of existing in a stable form wherein<br>
the volume fraction of the dispersed phase (ip) is<br>
greater than 0.7 and can be as high as 0.97. (iP is the<br>
volume ratio of discontinuous to continuous phase<br>
expressed as a fraction).<br>
 <br>
2.	The microscopic appearance of polyaphron dispersions where ip is greater than 0.7 is that of an aggregate of individual droplets, pushed closely together into polyhedral shapes, resembling the appearance of a gas foam. In this form, the dispersion has gel-like properties and is referred to as a Gel Polyaphron Dispersion (GPD).<br>
3.	Stable polyaphron dispersions can be formed with a surfactant concentration less than 3% and more typically less than 2% by weight of the total composition.<br>
4.	Gel Polyaphron Dispersions (as described in 2 above) can be diluted to any extent by the addition of more continuous phase without the addition of more surfactant, when the gel-like properties disappear. Once ip has been reduced to below 0.7, the individual droplets of internal phase become separated to take the form of spherical droplets, which remain stable and intact but which may nevertheless join together in loose associations and float to the top or sink to the bottom of the diluted dispersion (depending on the relative densities of the two phases). In this diluted form each droplet is referred to as a Colloidal Liquid Aphron (CLA). Simple shaking of the diluted dispersion instantly causes a homogeneous, stable dispersion of Colloidal Liquid Aphrons to re-form.<br>
Each of the above characteristics and a combination of them clearly differentiate the polyaphron dispersions of the present invention from conventional emulsions and other dispersion types which do not have all of those characteristics. Polyaphron dispersions are disclosed in the following literature references by Sebba: "Biliquid Foams",<br>
 <br>
J. Colloid and Interface Science, 40 (1972) 468-474 and "The Behaviour of Minute Oil Droplets Encapsulated in a Water Film", Colloid Polymer Sciences, 257 (1979) 392-396, Hicks "Investigating the Generation, Characterisation, and Structure of Biliquid Foams", PhD Thesis, University of Bristol, 2005, Crutchley "The Encapsulation of Oils and Oil Soluble Substances Within Polymer Films", PhD Thesis, The University of Leeds, 2006 and Lye and Stuckey, Colloid and Surfaces, 131 (1998) 119-136. Aphrons are also disclosed in US-A-4,486,333 and WO 97/32559.<br>
Polyaphron dispersions are sometimes referred to as 'Biliquid Foams', 'High Internal Phase Emulsions (HIPEs)', 'High Internal Phase Ratio Emulsions (HIPREs)' and 'Gel Emulsions'. In US 5,573,757 a composition comprising a polyaphron dispersion is described as "a viscoelastic gel". All descriptions that refer to dispersions having the characteristics described above are polyaphron dispersions as used in the present invention.<br>
By "topical application" is meant application to human or animal, preferably to the skin, including for example the face, scalp, feet, limbs or trunk.<br>
The present invention will now be further described. In the following passages different aspects of the invention are defined in more detail. Each aspect so defined may be combined with any other aspect or aspects unless clearly indicated to the contrary. In particular any feature indicated as being preferred or advantageous may be combined with any other feature or features indicated as being preferred or advantageous.<br>
As described above polyaphron dispersions comprise a continuous phase, a discontinuous phase and a surfactant. The discontinuous phase is preferably a substantially hydrophobic internal phase, commonly known as an oil<br>
 <br>
internal phase. Preferably, the discontinuous phase comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable oil phase.<br>
Examples of oils which may be used in the present invention include almond oil, babassu oil, blackcurrant seed oil, borage oil, canola oil, castor oil, coconut oil, cod liver oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, evening primrose oil, fish oil, grapeseed oil, mustard seed oil, oat oil, olive oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, shark liver oil, squalane, soybean oil, sunflower oil, walnut oil, wheat germ oil, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated coconut oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, hydrogenated palm oil, hydrogenated soybean oil, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl palmitate, modified triglycerides, caprylic/capric glycerides, fractionated triglycerides, glyceryl tricaprate, glyceryl tricaproate, glyceryl tricaprylate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate/laurate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate/linoleate, glyceryl<br>

Suitably the discontinuous phase comprises monoglycerides, diglycerides, or triglycerides.<br>
It will be understood that other suitable oils may be used in the present invention.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment, the discontinuous phase comprises or is caprylic/capric triglyceride and/or isopropyl myristate (IPM).<br>
The discontinuous phase may, for example, confer an emollient, occlusive, moisturising, conditioning or other cosmetic or pharmaceutical benefit to the skin. It may also increase the viscosity of the composition and may confer solvency to the active or actives. It may contain materials providing a heating or cooling effect when applied to the skin (for example capsaicin or menthol).<br>
The composition may comprise at least 1 % by weight of the discontinuous phase, more preferably at least 10% by weight, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 80 % by weight of the discontinuous phase based on the weight of the total composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be nonaqueous, substantially non-aqueous or aqueous.<br>
By the term "non-aqueous composition" as used herein is meant a composition which is effectively free of water and does not contain water that has been deliberately added. A "non-aqueous composition" as used herein preferably has less than 0.5% by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition, more preferably less than 0.2% by weight of water, most preferably less than 0.1% by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
By the term "substantially non-aqueous" as used herein is meant a composition comprising less than 5% by weight, more preferably less than 4.5% by weight, of water based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
By the term "aqueous composition" is meant a composition comprising at least 5% by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition. Preferably, the aqueous composition comprises at least 10%, or at least 15%<br>
 <br>
by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition. The aqueous composition may comprise at least 35%, or at least 40% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. For aqueous compositions, preferably the percentage of water is from 5% to 90% by weight, and more preferably from 5% to 50% by weight and most preferably from 8% to 20% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided an aqueous composition suitable for topical application comprising a continuous phase and at least one discontinuous phase, said composition comprising at least one polyaphron dispersion, at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid. In this embodiment preferably the composition comprises at least 5%, more preferably at least 6%, more preferably still at least 8% by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous composition suitable for topical application comprises from 60 to 95% by weight of discontinuous phase, and from 5 to 40 % by weight of continuous phase based on the total weight of the composition, wherein preferably the composition comprises from 5 to 40%, or from 5 to 30%, or from 8 to 20% by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition, wherein discontinuous phase and/or the continuous phase comprise at least one the vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid and at least one surfactant. More preferably the aqueous composition suitable for topical application comprises from 70 to 90% by weight of discontinuous phase, and from 10 to 30 % weight of continuous phase based on the total weight of the composition, wherein preferably the composition<br>
 <br>
comprises at least from 5 to 30%, or from 8 to 20% by weight of water based on the total weight of the composition, wherein discontinuous phase and/or the continuous phase comprise at least one the vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid and at least one surfactant. Preferably the composition of the present invention is dispersible in water. Preferably the composition of the present invention is dilutable in water. This increases the flexibility of use of the invention, for example in improving the application of the composition to the scalp through hair by leaving the hair wet, or from rinsing the preparation from any topical surface should the desire or need arise, or by the easy removal by rinsing of product from accidental contamination of clothing. These advantages improve the in-use experience of users and improve patient compliance.<br>
	 The advantages of providing an aqueous composition<br>
comprising at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue and at least one corticosteroid include improved drug permeation, control of drug permeation by the inclusion of certain permeation enhancers and permeation retarders and improved skin feel.<br>
When the continuous or external phase of the composition comprises water, close control of the pH within suitable limits is desired. Such control is desirable in order to obtain a stable composition. The present inventors have found that stable compositions of the present invention may be obtained When the pH of the composition is adjusted to a pH of from 7.0 to 8.5 , more preferably still to a pH of from 7.25 to 7.75. It will be understood that any suitable acid or base may be used to adjust the pH to the appropriate value or pH range. Typically the pH of the composition will need to be raised by the addition of a<br>
 <br>
base, which suitably may be triethanolamine. Other suitable bases include, but are not limited to<br>
trishydroxymethylaminomethane (tris) and sodium hydroxide. Advantageously and preferably, the pH of the composition may be stabilized by the incorporation of a suitable buffer into the aqueous phase. Suitable buffer systems having a pH within the specified range will be familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
The continuous phase may comprise or consist essentially of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid that is miscible or substantially miscible with water, preferably a compound of formula R1-OH where R1 is C1-C10 alkyl and/or a compound of formula HO-R2-H where R2 is -(C2H4)n or -(C3H6)n where n is 1 to 100, preferably 1 to 25. R1 and R2 may be linear or branched. Preferably R1 is C1-C4 alkyl. n is preferably 1 to 25. Preferably the continuous phase comprises propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, or a mixture thereof. Where the continuous phase comprises polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, the polyethylene or polypropylene glycol is preferably a polyethylene glycol which is liquid at room temperature (20°C). The polyethylene glycol may, for.example, contain from 1 to 12 ethylene or propylene oxide units and/or have a molecular weight of up to 600.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the composition, and preferably the polyaphron dispersion, comprises from 0 to 60 wt%, preferably from 0 to 20 wt%, more preferably from 0 to 15 wt%, of a C1-C4 alcohol, ethylene glycol, a liquid polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, a liquid polypropylene glycol, diethylene glycol mono ethyl ether or mixtures thereof. One of the advantages of the composition of the present invention over prior art compositions is that high levels of alcohol are not needed<br>
 <br>
as skin permeation enhancers. Alcohol is known to cause skin irritation when applied to damaged skin. The compositions of the present invention have the advantage that enhanced permeation can be achieved even without the need for alcohol to be present, or without the need for high levels of alcohol. The present inventors have surprisingly found that it is advantageous for the composition of the present invention to comprise from 0 to 25% by weight of alcohol, more preferably from 0 to 15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. Preferably the alcohol is isopropanol and/or propylene glycol. Such compositions have improved drug delivery properties.<br>
It will be understood that other suitable hydrophilic solvents may be used in the continuous phase of the polyaphrons.<br>
The surfactant used in the present invention may be incorporated into either or both phases of the polyaphron dispersion. Suitable surfactants include an alkyl polyglycol ether, an alkyl polyglycol ester, an ethoxylated alcohol, a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, a polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester, an ionic or non-ionic surfactant, a hydrogenated castor oil/polyoxyethylene glycol adduct containing from 25 to 60 ethoxy groups a castor oil/polyoxyethylene glycol adduct containing from 25 to 45 ethoxy groups, a sorbitan fatty acid ester (for example Span 20 or Span 80), a block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (for example Pluronic L121 or Pluronic F68), or a mixture thereof.<br>
It will be understood that other suitable surfactants may be used.<br>
Preferably the compositions of the present invention comprise less than 4% by weight of surfactant, more<br>
 <br>
preferably less than 3%, more preferably still less than 2% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The composition of the present invention may comprise at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue predominantly in the continuous phase, or predominantly in the discontinuous phase. Most preferably at least one vitamin D or vitamin D analogue is'present predominantly in the discontinuous phase.<br>
The vitamin D analogue employed in the composition of the present invention may, for example, be calcipotriol, seocalcitol, calcitriol, calcipotriol monohydrate, tacalcitol, maxacalcitol, paricalcitol, falecalcitriol, becocalcidiol, la,24S-dihydroxy-vitamin D2, 1(S),3(R)-dihydroxy-20 (R) - [.((3- (2-hydroxy-2-propyl) -phenyl) -methoxy) -methyl]-9,10-seco-pregna-5(Z),7(E),10(19)-triene, or a mixture thereof. More preferably, the vitamin D anolgue is calcipotriol, calcitriol, tacalcitol, maxacalcitol, lor,24S-dihydroxy-vitamin D2, 1(S),3(R)-dihydroxy-20(R)-[((3-(2-hydroxy-2-propyl)-phenyl)-methoxy)-methyl]-9,10-seco-pregna-5(Z) , 7(E),10(19)-triene, or a mixture thereof. Most preferably, the vitamin D analogues are calcipotriol and calcipotriol monohydrate. Other examples of suitable vitamin D analogues are described in US-B-6,753,013.<br>
Synthetic vitamin D analogues are preferred in the compositions of the present invention over naturally occurring vitamin D or vitamin D derivatives, since the therapeutic effects of the latter may be less selective for the treatment of skin diseases, such as psoriasis.<br>

The gelling agent may, for example, be selected from alginate gums or their salts, guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, gum acacia, gelatin, hydroxymethyl-cellulose hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl-cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or its salts, bentonites, magnesium aluminium silicates, "Carbomers" (salts of cross-linked polymers of acrylic acid), or glyceryl polymethacrylates or their dispersions in glycols. It will be understood that other suitable gelling agents may be used. Additionally, the inventors have discovered that some of the gelling agents (for example, carbomers) may also function as a chemical buffering agents thus preventing unwanted variation in the pH of the composition during storage and use.<br>

In one embodiment of the present invention, the composition as described herein may be applied to the scalp or other skin surface through hair. Preferably in.this, embodiment the hair is wetted (for example by use of water with or without shampoo, and then towel dried). The product may—then be applied to the scalp in a suitable amount and then massaged into the scalp through the hair. The hair may then be left to dry naturally or dried using a hair dryer. Advantageously, the water-dispersible form of the formulation enables an even distribution of the actives on the skin using this process. Alternatively, or additionally, the composition may be massaged into the scalp through dry hair and left for a suitable period (which may be 8 to 12 hours) after which the excess or reminder may be rinsed out with water with or without shampoo. Preferably the composition is applied to an animal in unit dosage form.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also contain other additives such as preservatives (for instance to prevent microbiological spoilage), buffering agents (for the control of pH and to avoid instability and damage to the skin's acid mantle), antioxidants and permeation enhancers.<br>
 <br>
These additives may be included in the continuous or the discontinuous phase of the polyaphron dispersion.<br>
It will be understood that the inclusion of these additives will be at the levels and with the type of materials which are found to be effective and useful. Care needs to be taken in the choice and amount of these additives to prevent compromise to the other performance advantages of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the vitamin D or vitamin D analogue of the present invention is dispersed and/or dissolved in the discontinuous phase of a first polyaphron dispersion. The corticosteroid is dispersed and/or dissolved in the discontinuous phase of a second polyaphron dispersion. The first and the second polyaphron dispersions are then mixed together to form the composition of the present invention. Optionally, a third or -further polyaphron dispersion may also be present in the composition of the present invention. The third or further polyaphron dispersion may, for example, comprise agents such as emollient oils (to improve in use 'feel'), occlusive oils to prevent skin dehydration and to enhance skin permeation by the actives, agents that provide a heating or cooling sensation when applied to the skin or sunscreens.

This composition provides good solubility for the actives, has an enhanced permeation and has a very pleasant feel.on the skin during and after.application.<br>
In a further embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises at least one discontinuous phase which comprises at least one of capric/caprylic triglycerides, squalane, dimethicone, isopropyl myristate, cyclomethicone and mixtures of two or more thereof, the vitamin D analogue is calcipotriol and the corticosteroid is betamethasone dipropionate, preferred surfactants in this embodiment are Laureth-4 and Poloxamer 188.

Preferably the continuous phase comprises water and xanthan gum, so as to form a gel to control viscosity. Such an embodiment is exemplified by Example 5. The inventors have found that the use of xanthane produces excellent stability at a lower viscosity which is of particular use as a lotion rather than a cream.<br>
In a further embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises at least one discontinuous phase which comprises at least one of capric/caprylic triglycerides, squalane, dimethicone, silicone elastomer, isopropyl myristate and cyclomethicone and mixtures of two or., more thereof, the vitamin D analogue is calcipotriol and the corticosteroid is betamethasone dipropionate, preferred surfactants in this embodiment are Laureth-4 and Poloxamer 188.

preparing a first polyaphron dispersion comprising a vitamin D or vitamin D analogue;<br>
preparing a second polyaphron dispersion comprising a corticosteroid;<br>
 <br>

For example EP 1,575,542 teaches the incorporation of a biliquid foam into aerosols.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be incorporated into aerosols by the addition of water and propellant gas (for example butane).<br>
The composition of the present invention may be in the form of, for example, a lotion or a cream. The composition may be stored in any suitable jar, tube, bottle, sachet, aerosol, spray applicator or pump action sealed container. Advantageously in order for the compositions to remain stable the containers preferably prevent oxygen from entering the container. Preferably the compositions of the present invention are sealed in air tight containers in order to prevent degradation of the compositions prior to use.<br>
The present invention will now be described further, by way of example only, with reference to the following figures, in which:<br>
 <br>
Figure 1 is a HPLC chromatogram of a stable sample (Example 7). Peaks for calcipotriol (3.9 min) and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) (5.3 min). No evidence of degradation products is observed. HPLC conditions are: Column:NovaPakCl8, 4μ particle size, 3.9 x 150mm column (Waters), Mobile phase: 55% acetonitrile in water. Flow rate: lml/minute. Column Temperature: 25°C.<br>
Figure 2 is a HPLC chromatogram of an unstable sample. Degradation of betamethasone dipropionate is observed (extra peak and shoulder at 2.5 minutes) and there is some evidence of calcipotriol degradation (very minor peak at 3.3 min). HPLC conditions are: Column:NovaPakCl8, 4μ particle size, 3.9 x 150mm column (Waters), Mobile phase: 55% acetronitrile in water. Flow rate: lml/minute. Column Temperature: 25°C.<br>
Figure 3 is a HPLC chromatogram of the degradation of calcipotriol as evidenced by the presence of extraneous peaks (4.5 min and 3.6 min) either side of the main calcipotriol peak (3.9 min). No betamethasone diproprionate (BDP) was present in this sample, thus these peaks cannot be due to BDP degradation. HPLC conditions are: Column:NovaPakCl8, 4μ particle size, 3.9 x 150mm column (Waters), Mobile phase: 55% acetronitrile in water. Flow rate: lml/minute. Column Temperature: 25°C.<br>
Definition of stability.<br>
For the present invention, a product is considered to be<br>
storage stable if it meets with the' following criteria.<br>
The product is stored in closed, airtight glass containers with headspace comprising no more than 5% by volume of the total usable volume of the container.<br>
 <br>
The product and the container as defined above are stored at a constant temperature of 40°C in a standard laboratory oven (for example, Heraeus 'Function Line' air circulating oven model UT6, temperature control ± 0.3°C at 150°C) .<br>
The product is examined at the end of the examination period. The examination period is at least 3 months and preferably at least 6 months from the start date of storage.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Any stored samples that meet the above criteria under the test conditions given above are considered to be storage stable for the purposes of this invention.<br>
The FDA's 'Guidance for Industry Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substance and Products' although non-binding, specifies accelerated storage conditions that include storage at specific temperatures (e.g. 40°C) for a specific time (6 months) and at a controlled relative humidity (75% RH). The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, ICH Q1A (R2) 'Stability Testing Guidelines: Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products' specifies identical conditions for accelerated storage testing. The stability test method specified above for the purpose of this invention does not include provision for the control of relative humidity since storage takes place in closed glass containers whose walls and closures are impervious to the passage of water vapour.<br>
The above definition of storage stable is definitive for the purposes of this invention. However, storage data on some examples were obtained by substituting close-sealed eppendorf tubes for closed glass containers (glass). This method was adopted to cope with relatively small amounts of sample and gives a reasonable approximation to the definitive method since eppendorf tubes also provide an impervious barrier and seal to water vapour and other components of the composition. The examination procedure for eppendorf tubes (plastic) is identical to that of the definitive method.<br>
 <br>
The following Examples further illustrate the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Three gel polyaphron dispersions of the following<br>
compositions were prepared by the following method.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
*The Calcipotriol content in the final formulation is<br>
50μg/g.<br>
**The betamethasone dipropionate content in the final<br>
formulation is 643μg/g (equivalent to 500μg/g of betamethasone).<br>
Manufacturing Method<br>
Three polyaphron dispersions were made individually by the following method:<br>
A low form, 250ml laboratory beaker (internal diameter 6.5cm) was charged with sufficient aqueous (continuous) phase to make 30 g of gel polyaphron. This was stirred at 200 rpm with a four-bladed impeller having a diameter of 6.0 cm whilst adding the oil (discontinuous) phase drop wise from a Pasteur pipette. The rate of addition at the start of the process was slow (approximately one drop every 7 seconds) but was speeded up once 10% of the oil phase had been added so that the total time to make the gel polyaphron was approximately 20 minutes.<br>
Prior to the manufacture of each gel polyaphron dispersion, any active was dissolved in the appropriate phase by gentle stirring overnight with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature in a covered beaker.<br>
To form the final product, the three individual polyaphron dispersions were mixed together.<br>
 <br>
Stability Measurements - conditions la<br>
Stability measurements made using the method outlined below. In this example the storage data was obtained in an eppendorf tube.<br>
The calcipotriol and betamethasone were extracted from the composition of Example 1 into isopropanol and assayed by HPLC under the conditions given below.<br>
HPLC conditions:<br>
Column:NovaPakC18, 4μ particle size, 3.9 x 150mm column (Waters)<br>
Mobile phase: 47% acetronitrile in water. Flow rate: lml/minute. Column Temperature: 25°C.<br>
Retention time for calcipotriol was 6.8 minutes Retention tine for betamethasone was 9.9 minutes.<br>
The inventors observed that after 2 months storage at 40°C, the levels of calcipotriol and betamethasone were 102% ±3% and 99% +1% of the original levels, respectively.<br>
Stability Measurements- conditions lb<br>
Stability measurements made using the method outlined below. Samples were stored in (airtight) glass jars in a suitable oven maintained at 40°C, as described above. The calcipotriol and betamethasone were extracted from the composition of Example 1 into isopropanol by mixing the sample in isopropanol followed by sonication and centrifugation. Aliquots of the supernatant were assayed by HPLC under the conditions given below.<br>
 <br>
HPLC conditions:<br>
Column:NovaPakCl8, 4μ particie size, 3.9 x 150mm column (Waters)<br>
Mobile phase: 55% acetronitrile in water. Flow rate: 1ml/minute. Column Temperature: 25°C.<br>
Retention time for calcipotriol was 3.9 minutes Retention tine for betamethasone was 5.3 minutes.<br>
The inventors observed that after 2 months storage at 40°C, the levels of calcipotriol and betamethasone were 102% ±3% and 99% ±1% of the original levels, respectively.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Manufacturing Method<br>
The method used was as described for Example 1 above except that propylene glycol and the neutralised aqueous gel were added to the final mixture of the three gel polyaphron dispersions, 1, 2 and 3 and then mixed in by simple mixing until the product was a homogeneous mixture of the polyaphron dispersions.<br>
By neutralised gel is meant the addition of triethanolamine (a base) to a dispersion of the polyacrylic acid to form a clear gel having a pH value of 7.5 ±0.2. The process of<br>
 <br>
neutralisation of polyacrylic acid gels is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Stability Measurements<br>
Stability was tested as in Example lb.<br>
The inventors observed that	after 3.5 months storage at 40°C<br>
in glass jars the levels of	calcipotriol and betamethasone<br>
dipropionate were 104 ± 12%	and 95 + 2 % of the original<br>
levels respectively.<br>
Stability testing is ongoing with this sample.<br>
Reference is made to Simonsen et:al, Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, 30(10) (2004) 1095-1102, wherein the authors state that the inclusion of propylene glycol to a product containing both calcipotriol and betamethasone causes rapid decomposition of one or other of the actives depending upon pH, although propylene, glycol is a very good flux rate enhancer. They concluded that it was not possible to include propylene glycol in their formulated product. This Example demonstrates that the inventors of the present invention have overcome this problem. Example 2, table 2 in US-B-6,753,013 illustrates the degradation of calcipotriol in a product comprising calcipotriol, betamethasone dipropionate and propylene glycol after storage for 2.5 months at 40°C.<br>
