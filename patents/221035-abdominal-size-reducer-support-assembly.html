COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (Section 10, rule 13)<br>
“Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly”<br>
I, Mrs. Vrushali Sunil Mehendale <br>
   168/3 Shailendra, Parvati <br>
    Pune 411 009, Maharashtra State, India <br>
    An Indian national<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br>
Dated this 19th  January, 2006 <br>
               			 (MRS. VRUSHALI SUNlL MEHENDALE)<br><br>
The present invention is directed generally to an Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly.<br>
More particularly, the present invention is directed to an Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly designed to enhance comfort when a person is lying on their back during abdominal exercises.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is directed to an Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly which includes an abdominal support which is designed to underlie the Pelvis and lower back area of the person and a head support positionable under the head of user. The Pelvis and lower back and the head support Assemblies can be used independent to each other or combined into a single Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly.<br>
The use of specially designed pillows for supporting back while sleeping, sitting, making a pregnant woman more comfortable while lying on her side on a mattress, while feeding a baby is generally known in the prior art.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,354 to Joseph A. Sheppard An inflatable therapeutic mattress for supporting a resting body in the prone position while maintaining proper spinal alignment, features an upper surface with a pair of opposing slanting surfaces originating from an elevated ridge, one slanting surface larger than the other. The larger slanting<br><br>
surface has a pillow to elevate the abdominal area of the resting body, and the smaller slanting surface has a pillow with a void to accommodate the face of the resting body.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,288,879 to J. L. Pate shows a wedge-shaped abdominal support pillow having a straight front edge adapted for insertion underneath the woman's abdomen while she is lying on her side. The upper surface of the pillow has a concave spherical configuration that conforms to the shape of the woman's abdomen, whereby the pillow provides abdominal support.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,397,052, to R. Lund shows an abdominal support pillow having approximately the same shape as the pillow in the Pate patent. The Lund patent additionally shows a back rest detachably attached to the abdominal support pillow, whereby the woman's body has a cradle-type support between the abdominal support pillow and the back rest.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,477, to G. Moore, shows a flat slab-like pillow construction adapted for positionment between the knees of a person, while he or she is resting or sleeping on a mattress. The pillow has a V notch in one edge, and a series of slits in the other edge, whereby the pillow can be bent into a buckled configuration, e.g., when the person is lying on his or her side with the legs in a bent or curled configuration.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,584,730, to E. Rajan, shows a flat slab-like pillow having a number of protrusions that can be used as legs to space the slab-like pillow above the mattress<br>
3<br><br>
surface. A person lying on his/her side can have one leg resting on the mattress (underneath the pillow) and the other leg resting on the upper surface of the pillow.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,522, to P. Everett, shows a pillow adapted for positionment between a person's legs while the person is lying on his or her back, on a mattress. The pillow has an I-beam cross section to keep the pillow in place; also, flexible straps can be attached to the pillow for extension around the person's legs, thereby further ensuring good retention of the pillow between the person's legs. The pillow has a transverse triangular notch that forms a hinge connection between two sections of the pillow, whereby the person can bend or straighten his/her legs without changing the fit of the pillow between the legs.<br>
The prior art provides pillow structures that offer at least partial cushioning and support for a person's back, lower back, abdomen and legs while the person is lying on a mattress and not performing any exercise. However, the prior art does not provide for a pillow structure that offers Pelvis and lower back support for abdominal exercise with the specific intention of reducing the abdominal size.<br>
The problems in performing abdominal exercise due to overstress on abdominal muscles (hurting the lower back arising out of abdominal exercise) are rapidly becoming more acute and they have also been acknowledged by various health experts, health researchers, health enthusiast, health clubs and scientific and medical society in general. There has been little or no alternative to the pattern of abdominal exercise to reduce the abdominal size, which would not cause injury to abdominal muscles and the lower back.<br>
4<br><br>
Thus there was an absolute need for some sort of support assembly which would be used by an individual while performing the abdominal exercises. The Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly, therefore, needs to be available without being too expensive and too limited to be practical for many commercial applications. The object of this invention is to provide for a support assembly that offers a complete support to Pelvis and lower back s, lower back, and head while the person is performing abdominal exercises.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Various abdominal exercises for fat reduction and measurement reduction of upper abdomen and lower abdomen are commonly practiced in all gymnasiums. However, for somebody who has an abdominal obesity and has never exercised in the past finds most of these exercises very strenuous and painful to perform as compared to other exercises like free weights lifting, lat pulley, peck deck or leg exercises. The main reason is that in all these exercises you have a choice of how much weight to lift. Dumbbells or barbells are available right from 1 kg to 100 kg. On the other hand in abdominal exercises you have to lift either the whole upper body or the lower body which is practically half the weight of your body.<br>
In most abdominal exercises either lower or upper half of the body is lifted while keeping the other half fixed on the ground. For example in leg raising exercise in lie down position, the upper body above waistline is kept rigid in horizontal position and contraction of abdominal muscles lifts the lower body.   When you lie down flat on the<br>
5<br><br>
ground, your entire body is in horizontal position. So the angle between the legs and head at the waistline is 180°. When you raise your legs, you reduce this angle to 90° (legs vertical) or even 45° (feet above head and thighs touching abdomen). Please note that while you are standing and when you bend, there also the angle at the waistline reduces from 180° to 90° and then to 45°. But the difference is that here, the bending and straightening of the upper body is caused due to the back muscles and not the abdominal muscles.<br>
Electronic gadgets like a tummy trimmer, tummy vibrator or other remedies like herbal diets etc. are also used but people have contradictory opinions about such therapies. Considering that physical exercise is still the best remedy for fat reduction, abdominal exercises can not be avoided. To reduce abdominal obesity maximum exercise is necessary for abdominal muscles. However due to the above stated problem not many repetitions of abdominal exercise can be done.<br>
If more repetitions of abdominal exercises are to be done with ease and less stress or pressure is to be put on abdominal muscles, then there are two ways. First, to provide external support to reduce the weight of lower body that is to be lifted and second, to make arrangement for the upper body to be rested in an angular position instead of in straight line. To give external support to the lower body is not feasible. However, this invention supports the upper body (from head to Pelvis and lower back s) comfortably so as to allow a person to do the strenuous abdominal exercise with ease and without causing injury to the lower back.<br>
6<br><br>
This invention consists of A Abdominal Size Reducer Support consisting of a Pelvis and lower back support having a generally depressed shape defined by the shape of Pelvis and lower back and a gentle inclination so as to support the Pelvis and lower back region of the individual and a head support positionable under a user's head, said head support being structured to support a user's head in a comfortable configuration while a user is reclined on his back in horizontal position, said head support being defined by the shape of the human head; and means releasably connecting said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support, said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support being usable in concert and separately, said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support being spaced apart from each other by said connecting means when said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support are used in concert.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This entire Assembly constitutes of two major parts, Pelvis and Lower Back Support (as shown in Fig. 1) and Head Support (as shown in Fig. 2). The said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support being usable in concert (as shown in Fig. 5) and separately, said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support being spaced apart from each other by said connecting means (as shown in Fig. 5, numeral 12) when said Pelvis and lower back support and said head support are used in concert.<br>
7	<br><br>
The Pelvis and Lower Back Support is to be placed under the Pelvis and lower back (half of the upper body) and the other Head Support is placed under the head of the individual performing the abdominal exercise, as the headrest.<br>
The slope, angle to the ground and the pelvis resting depression is all critically calculated to achieve a specific shape of the spine while exercising. If the angle of the slope is increased, then the pressure of lower body is transferred on to the chest. On the other hand if this angle is reduced, then the pressure comes on the middle part of spine. In both situations it does not serve the purpose. The sloping surface has a depression (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral 6) running down along with the slope which provides perfect support to the Pelvis and lower back, so while exercising a) the user does not lose balance, b) the Pelvis and lower back s do not slide down the slope due to sweat. Though the length and angle of slope is same, the shape and size of depression varies according to the user's Pelvis and lower back size.<br>
The user has to place Pelvis and Lower Back Support under the lower back. Pelvis and lower back are placed in the depression, the lower back rests on the slope and the upper back rests horizontally on the floor. After taking a correct position the user's entire upper body remains in forward bent position. The distance between the Pelvis and Lower Back Support and the Head Support is then adjusted with the help of nylon strap (as shown in Fig. 5, numeral 12) which is interloped in a buckle (as shown in Fig. 5, numeral 13) which is attached to the Head Support (as shown in Fig. 5). Though an ordinary pillow can be used instead of Head Support, there are chances of the Pelvis and Lower Back<br>
8<br><br>
Support slipping away from the lower back. Then the legs are raised to vertical position and then moved backward and forward according to the exercise.<br>
Pelvis and Lower Back Support has a unique shape and is crafted out of special material so as to give it sturdy appearance and a specific shape so as to accommodate the Pelvis and lower back of the user. The Base length of the Pelvis and Lower Back Support is about 407 mm whereas the Base width is about 534 mm (as shown in Fig 01, legends A &amp; B). The Maximum height of the Pelvis and Lower Back Support is about 165 mm (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral A &amp; D). Since the Pelvis and lower back area is placed in the depression as explained herein, the Maximum depth of depression is about 19 mm (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral 6).<br>
The entire assembly of Pelvis and Lower Back Support is thus made up of layers of plywood, HDPE, sponge and foam leather material wherein: plywood is used for the base (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral 1) to make it stable and stiff, wherein the plywood thickness is of 13 mm. Three sheets of a high-density polyurethane foam (HDPE) of thickness is of 51 mm is used (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral 2, 3 &amp; 4), wherein first HDPE sheet is pasted on the Plywood and then the remain 2 sheets of HDPE are pasted over each other so as to form a layer over the plywood base. On this HDPE sheets, a sponge of 26 mm thickness is pasted (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral 5). The entire layers are then covered with foam leather of thickness of 2 mm (as shown in Fig. 1, numeral 5). This gives us the entire assembly of the Pelvis and Lower Back Support, which has a Total weight of about 1.80 kg.<br>
9<br><br>
HDPE is preferred material which is adequately tuff but not as stiff as wood, plastics or metal. It is easy to cut, paste and to carve the necessary curves manually, as required. Most important characteristic of this material is that it can adjust to the minor curvature differences of each person's resting portion of body. It can take the necessary shape depending upon the amount of pressure it receives. At the same time, after use in exercise, it gains its original shape. It is light in weight, hence easy to handle, transport and store. It is also waterproof hence sweat is not absorbed inside.<br>
The entire assembly of Head Support is also made up of layers made up of plywood, HDPE, sponge and foam leather. Plywood is used for the base and high-density polyurethane foam is pasted to build the structure. The Base length of Head Support is about 254 mm (as shown in Fig. 2, numerals E &amp; F) and the Base width is of 534 mm (as shown in Fig. 2, numerals E &amp; G). The maximum height of Head Support is 78 mm which is as shown in Fig. 2 where the line of E &amp; F has perpendicular from H). Head Support has a maximum depth of depression of 25 mm. Even Head Support is made up of layers of plywood, HDPE, Sponge and Foam leather. The base of Head Support is made up of plywood with Base plywood thickness of 13 mm (as shown in Fig. 2, numeral 7). A 51 mm thick sheets pasted on one another of HDPE foam is pasted on the base plywood (as shown in Fig. 2, numeral 8 &amp; 9). A Sponge of 26 mm thickness is pasted on HDPE (as shown in Fig. 2, numeral 10) and finally Foam leather thickness 2 mm is pasted on the sponge (as shown in Fig. 2, numeral 7). The entire assembly of Head Support has a total weight of 0.900 kg<br>
10<br><br>
Pelvis and Lower Back Support and Head Support are inter connectable yet independent assemblies which are connected to each other with two adjustable nylon straps as shown in Fig 3 numeral 12. The Head Support has two fixed buckles (as shown in Fig. 3, numeral 13) into which the Nylon straps are interloped. The length between the two parts can be adjusted according to each person's length between head and Pelvis and lower back as shown in Fig 3.<br>

Benefits of the proposed assembly:<br>
The Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly is first of its kind in the fitness industry. Usually straight and sloping abdominal boards are commonly used on which the user lies down up side down, locks the legs to a hook and lifts upper body against the<br>
12<br><br>
gravity. However a person who has never exercised in life and whose abdominal muscles are not toned to pull almost half of body's weight against the gravity can not do more than handful of repetitions. Moreover, with the Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly people of varying size and weight could do and have been doing hundreds of repetitions of abdominal exercise with ease and comfort. Considering the fact that obesity is mainly concentrated in the abdominal area, abdominal exercise has a great importance. Moreover, the total weight of the Abdominal Size Reducer Support Assembly is barely 2.7 kg so it enhances mobility of the assembly and individuals can carry it anywhere and use it without having to go to a gymnasium.<br>
