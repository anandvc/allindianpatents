				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved device<br>
for heat insulation of ladle cover and a method of constructing<br>
the same.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to an improved<br>
heat insulating device for ladle cover, in which strips of<br>
ceramic fibre blanket are wrapped in the form of coils around<br>
the outer peripheral surface of a number of concentric rings<br>
of increasing diameter made of stainless steel strips and held<br>
in position thereon by a number of stainless steel rods<br>
introduced radially into the rings as well as the layers of<br>
ceramic fibre blanket strips wrapped around the rings and the<br>
dish-shaped body thus formed is kept suspended with its plane<br>
Parallel to the horizontal inner surface of the ladle cover by<br>
means of a number of stainless steel hangers and the method<br>
followed for constructing the said device.<br>
In the steel manufacturing process, ladles, used for<br>
transportation/treatment of molten metal, are required to be<br>
preheated by means of burners and maintained at a high<br>
temperature of around 1OOO°C by heat insulation of the ladle<br>
cover before tapping molten metal into the ladles, with a view<br>
to preventing formation of skulls, damage of the refractory<br>
linings and loss of molten metal temperature in the ladles and<br>
extending the working life of the ladle covers.<br>
The existing device for heat insulating the ladle<br>
covers comprises fixing in two layers a ceramic fibre blanket<br>
of thickness 25 mm with the direction of fibres in the two<br>
layers perpendicular to each other, by means of stainless steel<br>
studs and washers of AISI 310 grade which are not kept covered<br>
up by the ceramic fibre blanket, and are therefore corroded by<br>
oxidation by the high temperature environment inside the ladles,<br>
resulting in the failure of the insulation device within a<br>
relatively short period i.e. 6 to 9 months with consequent<br>
increase in the down time of the ladles and cost of maintenance<br>
of the insulation device.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
improved device for heat insulating ladle covers, having an<br>
expected longer working life of around three years.<br>
Thus the invention provides an improved device for heat<br>
insulation of ladle covers, characterised in that the device<br>
comprises multiple layers of strips of ceramic fibre blanket<br>
wrapped tightly around the outer peripheral surface of four<br>
concentric metallic rings of increasing diameter and held in<br>
position with respect to said rings by means of twentyfour<br>
metallic rods inserted into the said rings and the layers of<br>
ceramic fibre strips v/rapped around the rings to form a dish-like<br>
body which is kept suspended with its horizontal plane parallel<br>
to the inner surface of the ladle cover by means of twenty hangers<br>
each having its one end fixed to the inner surface of the lader<br>
cover and other end to the junction of a rod and ring laid in the<br>
said dish-like body formed.<br>
The invention provides also a method of constracting<br>
the improved device comprising the following steps in<br>
sequence :-<br>
(i) 200 mm wide and 50 mm thick strips are cut from ceramic<br>
fibre blanket of type HTZ, density 128 kg/m3 and composition by<br>
weight % : Al2O3 - 33 to 36, SiO2 - 44 to 48, ZrO2 - 16 to 18,<br>
TiO2 - 0.3 and Fe2O3 - 0.1;<br>
(ii) the strips ar*r wrapped manually first round the outer<br>
peripheral surface of innermost ring in multiple layers tightly<br>
upto a radial thickness of 600 mm;<br>
(iii) the next outer ring is then fitted around the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the outermost layer of the ceramic fibre<br>
strips wrapped around ring and pressed by means of a fixture made<br>
from a 50 mm wide metallic strip fitted around the outer peripheral<br>
surface of ring to reduce the radial thickness of ceramic fibre<br>
strips wrapped around ring from 600 mm to 500 mm;<br>
(iv) eight rods are then inserted into matching holes in<br>
ring and next into matching holes of inner rings, and in four<br>
hangers;<br>
(v) the free ends of ring are joined by a screw through<br>
the matching holes therein and the free ends of hangers are fixed<br>
to the inner surface of ladle cover by welding;<br>
(vi) eight rods and ring are removed and ceramic fibre strips<br>
are wrapped manually around the outer peripheral surface of ring<br>
tightly upto a radial thickness of 600 mm;<br>
(vii) ring is again fitted around the outer peripheral surface<br>
of the outermost layer of the ceramic fibre strips wrapped around<br>
ring in the same manner as in steps (iii) to (vi), followed for<br>
fixing ring;<br>
(viii) outer ends of eight rods are fixed at the matching<br>
holes in ring and the rods are fixed next into matching holes<br>
of inner rings, and in four hangers by eight cotter pins<br>
respectively through hole in each rod, and the free ends of<br>
hangers are fixed to the inner surface of the ladle cover by<br>
welding;<br>
(ix) wrapping of ceramic fibre strips, fixing of ring,<br>
sixteen rods, eight hangers and twenty cotter pins are<br>
performed in the same manner as in steps (ii) to (viii).<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in<br>
an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which -<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic bottom view of the existing<br>
device for heat insulating ladle covers;<br>
Figure 2a is the schematic bottom view of the<br>
improved device for heat insulating ladle covers;<br>

where the two free ends of a ring are joined by a serew.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 the existing device for heat<br>
insulating the inner surface of a ladle cover comprises two<br>
layers of 25 mm thick ceramic fibre blanket with the fibres in<br>
the two layers being directed perpendicular to each other, and<br>
fixed tightly to the inner surface of the ladle cover by means<br>
of stainless steel studs (1) of AISI 310 grade which are welded<br>
to the ladle cover at their one end at a separation of 150 mm<br>
from the adjacent ones and stainless steel washers of the same<br>
grade. The outer ends of the studs and the washers are left<br>
exposed to the hot environment inside the ladle and so get<br>
corroded in a relatively short period of 6 to 9 months of use<br>
of the ladle causing displacement of the ceramic fibre blanket<br>
layers in the downward direction and making the device<br>
ineffective•<br>
Referring to Fig. 2a, the improved device for heat<br>
insulating ladle covers comprises concentric rings (r1 to r4);<br>
radially introduced rods (R1 to R24); hangers (H1 to H20);<br>

(ii) the strips are wrapped round the outer peripheral<br>
surface of ring (r1) in multiple layers tightly upto a radial<br>
thickness of 600 mm;<br>
(iii) ring (r2) is fitted around the outer peripheral<br>
surface of the outermost layer of the ceramic fibre strips<br>
wrapped around ring (r1) and tightened by means of a fixture<br>
made from a 50 mm wide metallic strip fitted around the outer<br>
peripheral surface of ring (r2) to reduce the radial thickness<br>
of ceramic fibre strips wrapped around ring (ri) from 600 mm<br>
to 500 mm;<br>
(iv) rods (R17, R18, R19, R20, R21, R22, R23, R24) are<br>
inserted into matching holes in rings {ri, r2, r3) and hangers<br>

(v) the free ends of ring (r2) are joined by a screw<br>
through the matching holes (10, 11) therein and the free ends<br>
of hanger <h1 h2 h3 ha are fixed to the inner surface of></h1>
ladle cover (2) by welding;<br>
(vi) rods (R17, R18, R19, R20, R21, R22, R23, R2A) and<br>
ring (r3) are removed and ceramic fibre strips are wrapped<br>
around the outer peripheral surface of ring (r2) upto a radial<br>
thickness of 600 mm tightly;<br>
(vii) ring (r3) is fitted around the outer peripheral<br>
surface of the outermost layer of the ceramic fibre strips<br>
wrapped around ring (r2) in the same manner as in steps (iii) to<br>
(vi) followed for fixing ring (r2);<br>
(viii) outer ends of rods (R17, R18, R19, R20, R21, R22,<br>
R23, R2A) are fixed at the matching holes in ring (r3) by cotter<br>
pins (P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22, P23, P24) respectively<br>
through hole (7) in each rod,and the free ends of hangers (H5,<br>

P11, P12, P13, P1A, P15, P16) are performed in the same manner<br>
as in steps (ii) to (viii).<br>
The rings, rods, hangers and cotter pins used in the<br>
construction of the improved device for heat insulation of the<br>
ladle cover are each made of stainless steel of Grade 304, and<br>
kept covered up completely with the ceramic fibre strips to<br>
prevent their corrosion by oxidation in hot environment inside<br>
the ladle.<br>
