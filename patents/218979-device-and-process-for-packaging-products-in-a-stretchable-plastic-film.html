DEVICE AND PROCESS FOR PACKAGING PRODUCTS IN A STRETCHABLE PLASTIC FILM<br>
	The present invention refers to a device for<br>
packaging products in a stretchabls plastic film, and to a<br>
process that uses such device. The below-described device<br>
is in practice an electromechanical arrangement that<br>
performs the winding of a product to be packaged into a<br>
plastic film, in a surrounding and stretched way,<br>
completely closing the product to be packaged.<br>
	Various systems are known in the art and operate,<br>
through different modes, to perform the winding of a<br>
plastic film around a product. These systems, that are<br>
generally automated, operate by pusing the product to be<br>
packaged either inside a sleeve formed by the plastic film<br>
that is afterwards cut and bent on the two sides under the<br>
product, or by pushing the product to be packaged upwards<br>
from below on a sheet of plastic film, stretched through<br>
suitable mechanical means and clamping jaws, and<br>
afterwards bent under the product itself through a jaw<br>
mechanism with automatic movement and with a possible<br>
product translation.<br>
These systems require machines with highly complex<br>
and costly mechanical devices with many motored and<br>
specifically programmed parts. In such case it is<br>
difficult to constantly operate such machines, that<br>
require, in addition to specific plastic films with high<br>
quality, also high maintenance costs, given the complex<br>
contents of the various mechanisms composing them. They<br>
further require a high degree of preventive maintenance<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/IT2003/00025G<br>
from the operator, since residuals of the various products<br>
to be packaged can obstacle the movements of the<br>
mechanical machine parts, especially the means for<br>
clamping and stretching the plastic film.<br>
	Object of the present invention is solving the above<br>
priorâ€”art problems, by providing a device and its related<br>
process, that are easily manufactured, installed and<br>
operated, allow performing all packaging operations<br>
manually, but also automatically, in a simple and<br>
straightforward way by the end user.<br>
	A further object of the present invention is<br>
providing a device and a process as mentioned above, in<br>
which the device is equipped with a reduced number of<br>
component parts, and anyway allows realising a great<br>
number, of packaging operations (also of a variable format)<br>
in a controlled and efficient way, without damages for the<br>
operators.<br>
	The above and other objects and advantages of the<br>
invention, as will appear from the following description,<br>
are obtained by a device and a process as claimed,<br>
respectively, in Claims 1 and 37. Preferred embodiments<br>
and non-trivial variations of the present invention are<br>

With reference to the Figures, a preferred embodiment<br>
of the device and process of the present invention is<br>
shown and described. It will be immediately obvious to the<br>
skilled people in the art that numerous variations and<br>
modifications (for example related to shape, sizes,<br>
various colours and parts with equivalent functionalities)<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2004/04820l							PCT/IT2003/000256<br>
could be made to the described device and process without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention as claimed in<br>
the enclosed Claims.<br>
	The term "product" herein below means both a single<br>
object or element to be packaged (for example in the<br>
foodstuff field), and the same object or element placed, in<br>
a container, housing, tray or the like, for packaging the<br>
whole assembly.<br>
	The device described herein below corresponds to a<br>
semi-automatic system in which the functions of supplying<br>
the plastic film 14 for packaging the products are<br>
performed manually, as well as the descent of the<br>
packaging head 5 see Fig. 1-2).<br>
	With reference first of all to Fig- 1, the device<br>
consists in a basement 1, where two shoulders 2 are fixed<br>
that carry the head with rollers 3 that support the coil 4<br>
of the stretchable plastic film 14. In the shoulders 2,<br>
the visual devices 12 of the electric control panel (for<br>
example displays of the number of packaged pieces,<br>
switches, etc.) can be inserted.<br>
	The basement 1 is composed of a structure that is<br>
sturdy enough to support all efforts acting on pins and<br>
connections of the related gas springs 7 that balance the<br>
head 5, in order to secure the side shoulders 2. Moreover,<br>
the heated plane 8 and the rotating and restraining<br>
supports (not shown) of the basculating head 5 are<br>
fastened on the basement 1. Moreover, the suitable limit<br>
sensors (not shown) for operating the machine, in addition<br>
to all those components related to the electric panel (not<br>
shown 1 , are fastened and contained in the basement 1.<br>
	In order to work with the above-mentioned device, the<br>
coil 4 at the stretchable plastic film 14 is placed on the<br>
roller head 3 of the machine. The film 14 is unwound<br>
-4â€”<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/lT2003/000256<br>
through the containment rollers a, b, c, d of the<br>
basculating packaging head 5. Manually, or automatically,<br>
the film 14 must be interposed for its meaningful length,<br>
suitable for packaging, between the basculating head plane<br>
Z and the film-locking frame 6.<br>
	In order to best use the film 14 that winds the<br>
product to be packaged in its correct length, 3 hot-wire<br>
cutter 9 for the film 14 is adjusted and is placed on the<br>
basemsnt 1 by horizontally translating it and making it<br>
operate when the head 5 is lowered.<br>
	After that, the product for tray containing the<br>
product) is placed on the hot plane 8 by positioning it in<br>
its correct position, using the stop abutment 11. At that<br>
time, by lowering the packaging head 5 through the handle<br>
10 down to the lower stop of the head 5 itself, the limit<br>
sensor 13 is actuated in the same position and it starts<br>
the suitable mechanisms placed inside the head 5, that are<br>
adapted to wind the film 14 onto the product (or tray<br>
containing the product) along all its sides in a stretched<br>
way.<br>
	After having ended the automatic packaging cycle, the<br>
packaging head 5 is kept in its upper stop position (see<br>
Fig. 1) , and the packaged product arranged on the hot<br>
abutment plane 8 can be manually taken by the operator. It<br>
is obviously possible to provide for variations that allow<br>
automating such operation, for example as bands (not<br>
shown) adapted to be handled when the device head 5 is in<br>
its uppoer stop position to take the packaged product and<br>
lay a new product to be packaged on the abutment plane 8.<br>
	The abutment plane 8 is heated in order to obtain a<br>
closed and stable package, since the heat emanated<br>
the refrom heats the four edges of the film 14 overlapped<br>
by the machine and inserted under the product by the<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/IT2003/000256<br>
machine itself, thereby attaching the film 14 edges to the<br>
product.<br>
	Herein below the parts and the mechanical and<br>
electromechanical arrangements that realise the<br>
functionalities of the present invention will be described<br>
and shown.<br>
	Fig. 4 first of all shows the cutter assembly 9 for<br>
the film 14.<br>
	Such cutter 9 is composed of a blade 25, preferably<br>
made of steel, heated through an electric resistance<br>
placed inside it. This blade 25 is secured onto an<br>
insulated metat guide 9' that is longitudinally slidable<br>
as shown by the arrows and is secured in the desired<br>
position by means of knobs 27.<br>
	The hot blade 25 with the packaging head 5 lifted is<br>
protected by a screen 23 placed on springs 24. The hot<br>
blade 25, going out in 2.8 from the recess obtained on the<br>
screen 23, operates on the plastic film 14 stretched under<br>
the packaging head 5 generating the melt cutting of the<br>
film 14. The whole hot blade assembly 29 is placed on<br>
springs 26 that, during the packaging head 5 lowering<br>
operation, are pressed, together with, the springs 24. As<br>
already described, with pressed springs 24, tine hot blade<br>
25 goes out of the screen 23 by means of the recess 20<br>
generating the plastic film 14 cutting, and the springs 26<br>
accompany the hot blade assemblv 29 in parallel with the<br>
descent of the packaging head 5 and allow the hot blade 25<br>
to operate for a longer time for cutting the film 14.<br>
	Fig- 5 instead shows in detail the heated plane 8 for<br>
resting the product to be packaged.<br>
	Such plane 8 is placed on the machine basement 1 in a<br>
central position to the packaging area of the head 5. This<br>
resting plane 8 for the products to be packaged is heated<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2004/048202							PCT/IT2003/000256<br>
through electric resistances 30 placed inside the metallic<br>
box 8 composing it. Obviously, the heated plane 8<br>
temperature is not relevant and remains within the limits<br>
of the operator safety standards. The temperature is<br>
adjusted by a suitable electric thermoregulating system 31<br>
inserted into the basement 1.<br>
	The purpose of having an hot resting plane 8, as<br>
already previously described, is welding the film 14 edges<br>
placed under the product in contact with the hot plane 8<br>
after having packaged the product.<br>
	Fig. 6 schematically shows the frame 6 for pressure-<br>
locking the film 14 and the related control mechanism 20.<br>
	With basculatinq packaging head 5 lifted, the<br>
pressing frame 6 of the film 14 is opened with respect to<br>
the plane Z of the packaging head 5. The film 14 is<br>
manually inserted (Fig. 13) from the top downwards in the<br>
space existing between frame 6 and plane Z of the<br>
packaging head 5. The length of the inserted film is<br>
adjusted depending on the width of the product to be<br>
packaged.<br>
	As shown in Fig. 6, the pressing frame 6 of the film<br>
14 is composed of a frame 6 hinged to the lower end 34 of<br>
the basculsting packaging head 5. This frame, preferably<br>
built like a fork, has a rim 32 inserted whose size is<br>
equal to the external perimeter of the hole 37 of the<br>
packaging head 5, where a gasket toot shown) is inserted,<br>
adapted to block the film 14 with the frame 6 closed. A<br>
suitable electromagnet 20, placed, integral with the<br>
basculating hsad 5, is controlled by the feeler system 36<br>
of the limit sensor 35 and a related electric system, and<br>
starts operating when the packaging head 5 starts<br>
lowering. The metallic striker of the magnet 33 integral<br>
with the lever connected to the pressing frame 6 - fulcrum<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/IT2003/000256<br>
34 is attracted through an electric pulse towards the<br>
magnet 20, making the frame 6 close and locking the<br>
plastic film 14 with a force that is proportional to the<br>
electric current intensity operating on the magnet 20<br>
itself.<br>
	At the end of the electric current pulse on the<br>
magnet 20, the frame 6 goes back to its opening position<br>
through the action of a spring 38 that works under<br>
traction.<br>
	During the basculating packaging head 5 descent, the<br>
plastic film 14, blocked by the pressing frame 6 onto the<br>
hole perimeter of the packaging head 5, is stretched by<br>
inserting the product itself placed on the heated plane 8.<br>
	At the lower end-of-stroke, the packaging head 5, by<br>
abutting onto its suitable striker, actuates the limit<br>
sensor 35 and, through motor 19 and transmission belts 17,<br>
actuates the blades 15, 16, 45, 46, that wind the product<br>
with the plastic film 14 by also inserting it under the<br>
product placed on the hot plane 8.<br>
	The movement of the blades 15, 16, 45, 46 is<br>
automatic and reciprocating, controlled by limit sensors<br>
3 9 and 40.<br>
	Upon starting the blades 15, 16, 45, 46 for packaging<br>
the product, the pressing frame 6 of the plastic film 14<br>
is opened, freeing the film 14 that has already been cut<br>
by tha hot blade 9, and the blades 15, 16, 45, 46 proceed<br>
in packaging the product itself. The detachment of the<br>
pressing frame 6 of the film. 14 from the base Z of the<br>
packaging head 5 is controlled by the limit sensor 41.<br>
chat is longitudinally adjustable as shown by the arrow in<br>
Fig. 7. This adjustment allows delaying or anticipating<br>
the frame 6 detachment that locks the plastic film 14, in<br>
order to obtain a greater or lower film 14 tension when<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/IT2003/000256<br>
packaging the product.<br>
	Fig. 8 schematically shows in A plan view the<br>
packaging head 5. It is composed of a metallic container,<br>
having a plane bottom with an adequate opening for the<br>
maximum format of the packages that the machine can<br>
perform. The supports carrying the rotating shafts 18 are<br>
fixed to the metal walls of such container. At the ends of<br>
these rotating shafts 18, two toothed pulleys that carry a<br>
toothed belt 17 (or similar transmission means) are fixed.<br>
The packaging blades 15, 16, arranged on lateral guides 53<br>
and overlapped as in Fig. 9, are connected to the toothed<br>
belts 17, by means of clamps 43, 44, 50, 51. These<br>
packaging blades 15, 16, 45, 46 can translate on the<br>
lateral guides 53 by means of clamps 43, 44, 50, 51<br>
connected to the toothed belts 17 till they overlap. The<br>
movement of the belts 17 is transmitted by the system with<br>
ratio-motor 19, toothed pulleys, rotating shafts 18.<br>
	As already described previously, these blades 15, 16,<br>
45, 46 have an automatic reciprocating movement as shown<br>
by the arrows (Fig- 8).<br>
	The blade 15 is connected, by means of two<br>
oscillating arms 48, 49 and two rotating pins 52 for each<br>
arm 48, 49, to the two blades 45, 46 that are<br>
longitudinally placed with respect to the head 5 and<br>
transversally placed with respect to the blades 15, 16,<br>
During the translation approaching movement of the blades<br>
15, 16, the two arms 48, 49 are hinged through the<br>
rotating pins 52 on the balade 15 and the blades 45, 46:<br>
these latter ones thereby converge towards the center of<br>
the packaging area as shown by the arrows (Fig. 8 and 19).<br>
As already previously described, the movement of the<br>
blades 15, 16, 45, 46 is reciprocating, being connected to<br>
the ratio-motor - toothed pulleys - rotating shafts -<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/IT2003/000256<br>
terminals system.<br>
	Fig. 11 and 12 schematically show the overlapping and<br>
position of the blades 15, 16, 45, 46 during the product<br>
packaging cycle. As schematically shown in Fig. 11, the<br>
blades 15, 16 when approaching, insert the film 14 under<br>
the product on two sides and the blades 45, 46 (Fig. 12)<br>
insert the film 14 simultaneously under the product on the<br>
other two sides; then, the film 14 under the product<br>
appears with the four edges overlapped by the blades 15,<br>
16, 45, 46 and welded by means of heat supplied by the<br>
heating plane 8.<br>
	An improvement as regards the use of the machine is<br>
shown in Fig. 14 and 15. They show a schematic view<br>
related to the automatic positioning of the film 14. The<br>
film 14 is passed on a motored rotating roller 55. This<br>
roller 55 is connected through transmission belts to the<br>
roller 18'. The ratio-motor assembly 54, operating on the<br>
roller 55, starts operating the transmission belts (placed<br>
on the sides of the packaging head 5). The transmission<br>
belts are connected to and control the jaws 56 that are<br>
opened and closed with a mechanical system that operates<br>
thereon when they reach the translation point determined<br>
by the limit sensors 58, 59. These limit sensors 58, 59,<br>
according to their position, make the jaws 56 translate,<br>
and the jaws 56 grip and drag the plastic film 14<br>
inserting it between plane "Z" of the packaging head 5 and<br>
the pressing frame 6 of the film 14.<br>
	This gripping movement of the film 14 by the jaws 56<br>
automatically occurs when the packaging head 5 is lifted<br>
in its upper stop position, thereby facilitating the<br>
operator's manual handling durinq the product packaging<br>
process.<br>
	According to a variation of the device of the<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2004/04820l							PCT/1T2043/000256<br>
invention shown in Fig. 16, the head 5 is adapted to<br>
perform, in addition to the opening and closing movement<br>
by lifting and lowering, a basculating approach and<br>
retraction movement with respect to the device structure:<br>
such movements of the head 5 are provided to facilitate<br>
the works of a responsible operator. They are obtained in<br>
particular because the head 5 is connected to the<br>
shoulders 2 through a toggle pin 60 adapted to provide at<br>
one of its ends 62 a point secured to the head 5 end at<br>
another of its ends 64 a rotating pin point with the<br>
shoulders 2.<br>
	According to a further variation of the inventive<br>
device, also shown in Fig. 16, the means 8 for supporting<br>
and heating the product are adapted to slide along the<br>
basement 1 of the device in order to further facilitate<br>
the works of a responsible operator. In particular, the<br>
means 8 can slide onto the basement 1 through sliding<br>
guides 66 or other suitable systems, being then stopped in<br>
their operating position once having loaded thereon the<br>
product to be packaged.<br>
	With the above-described device, it is possible to<br>
realise an automated or partially automated inventive<br>
process, that comprises the following main steps:<br>
	-supporting and simultaneously heating one of the<br>
products to be packaged on a lover abutment side of<br>
the product;<br>
	-supplying the film 14 from the storage means 4 in a<br>
position overlaying the product to bs packaged;<br>
	-clamping the film 14 in the position overlaying the<br>
product to be packaged;<br>
	-cotactitng the clapped film 14 with the product to<br>
be packaged, in such, a way as to adhere the film 14<br>
to the product in a stretched position;<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2004/04820l							PCT/1T2043/000256<br>
	-	cutting the film 14 in stretched contact with the<br>
		product along its side that is still not connected<br>
		to the film 14 coming from the storage means 4;<br>
	-	releasing the cut film 14 in stretched contact with<br>
		the product;<br>
	-	bending the film 14 under the product through a<br>
		bending action on a whole lower perimeter of the<br>
		product, where such bending step allows the film 14<br>
		to adhere to the product on its lower heated<br>
		abutment side by glueing tpgether the four edges of<br>
		the film 14; and<br>
	-	removing the product packaged in the film 14.<br>
	In particular, the step of contacting the clamped film<br>
14 with the product to be packaged is performed by keeping<br>
the product still and by placing above it the clamped film<br>
14, but it could also be performed in reverse, namely by<br>
keeping the clamped film 14 still and by pushing the<br>
product against it.<br>
	Moreover, the step of contacting the clamped film 14<br>
with the product further comprises adjusting the film 14<br>
tension onto the product, while the step of clamping the<br>
film 14 further comprises the step of adjusting the film<br>
14 locking pressure by adjusting the electric voltage on<br>
the magnet 20.<br>
	According to a further particular feature of the<br>
inventive process, the step of clamping the film 14<br>
further comprises the step of performing a film 14<br>
unlocking that is variable in time, with respect to the<br>
device cycle, with respect to the step of bending the film<br>
14.<br>
	And still, the step of cutting the film 14 is<br>
performed through cutting means 25 and the process further<br>
comprises the step of heating the cutting means 25 before<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2004/048201							PCT/lT2003/000256<br>
the step of cutting the film 14.<br>
	In a variation of the inventive process, it further<br>
comprises, after the step of supporting the product, the<br>
step of placing the product in a prefixed packaging<br>
position.<br>
	Moreover, the step of bending the film 14 under the<br>
product could occur simultaneously on all sides of the<br>
product, or could occur firstly on two product sides and<br>
then on other two product sides opposed therewith.<br>
	Finally, the inventive process further comprises the<br>
step of pressing the product to keep the product still<br>
during its packaging with the film 14.<br>
