				<td>FIELD OF THE INEVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of dialkyi carbonates. Particularly, it relates to an eco-friendly, efficient process for producing of dialkyi carbonates of general formula (1).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula 1 wherein R = alkyl (C1 -C8) or C6H5CH2 More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of dialkyi carbonate from cyclic carbonate in the presence of double metal cyanide catalyst.<br>
The solid, double metal cyanide catalyst, used in the present invention is described and disclosed in our co-pending Indian patent application no. 175NF2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The dialkyi carbonates are precursors of bis-phenol-A-polycarbonate, a polymer known for its wide range of uses based upon its characteristics of transperancy, shock resistance and processability. They are important intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plastics. Dialkyi carbonates also find applications as synthetic lubricants, solvents, plasticizes and monomers for organic glass. They are efficient alkylating agents and the processes using them are more eco-friendly compared to the conventional alkylation processes.<br>
Conventionally, dialkyi carbonates and dimethyl carbonate in particular are synthesized using toxic chemicals like phosgene (COCI2). Alternatively, they can be synthesized by oxidative carbonylation (CO + O2) route using CuCI-base catalysts at high reaction temperatures. But this route is hazardous and produces corrosive hydrochloric acid. They are also produced from methanol by reacting with NO + CO + O2 in the presence of a Pd/C catalyst. This route also bears a potential explosion problem. Toxic NO is main problem in the carbonylation of intermediate methylnitrile in this route (Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design, Vol 40, Ed. by J.J.<br>
McKetta and W. A Cunningham, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, 1992, and Ulmann's encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A 21, Ed. by B. Elvers, S. Hawkins and G. Schulz, 5th ed. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, mbH, Germany 1992).<br>
Synthesis of dialkyi carbonates by transesterification of cyclic carbonates with corresponding alcohols is an eco-friendly, non-toxic route. In recent times dialkyi carbonates especially dimethyl carbonate and dipropyl carbonates are commercially synthesized by this technology (Filtration Industry Analyst 1999 (Issue No. 27, June 1999) 2 and S. Fukuoka, M. Kawamura, K. Komiya, M. Tojo, H. Hachiya, K. Hasegawa, M. Aminaka, H. Okamoto, I. Fukawa, S. Konno, Green Chem. 5 (2003) 497). Other than mineral acids and alkali bases, compounds like metal alkoxides (aluminum isopropoxide, tetraalkoxytitanium, (RO)Cu(PPh3)n, PdMe(OCHCF3Ph(dpe)), organotin alkoxides etc.), non-ionic bases (amines, dimethylaminopyridine, guanidines etc.) and lipase enzymes are known to catalyze the transformation of cyclic carbonates to dialkyi carbonates. But these catalysts possess the drawback of unstability or difficulty in separating and reuse (J. Otera, Chem. Rev. 93 (1993) 1449).<br>
There were efforts toward developing solid catalysts for preparing dialkyi carbonates. Tatsumi et al. (Chem. Commun. Year 1996, page 2281) reported the synthesis of dimethyl carbonates from ethylene carbonate and methanol using K-TS-1 as a solid base catalyst. The transesterification of dimethyl oxalate with phenol was reported recently by Ma et al., (Fuel Proc. Tech. Vol. 83, Year 2003, page 275). Srivatsava et al reported the application of titanosilicate catalysts (Catal. Today Vol. 93, Year 2004, page 127). In all these applications the efficiency of the solid catalysts and yield of dialkyi carbonate is rather low. Wei et al (Green Chem. Vol. 5, Year 2003, page 343; Catalysis of Organic Reactions Ed. By D. G. Morrell, Marcel and Decker Inc., New York, Year 2003, Chapter 58, page 659), Chu et al (Inorg. Chim. Acta Vol. 307, Year 2000, page 131), Watanabe and Tatsumi (Microporous Mesoporous Mater. Vol. 22, Year 1998, page 399) and Fang and Xiao (Separation and Purification Tech. Vol. 34, Year 2004, page 255) report the use of solid catalysts but yield of dialkyi carbonate is low (50 mol%). There were reports to synthesize dialkyi carbonates in a single-step process by<br>
reacting epoxides, CO2 and alcohol over solid catalysts (Bhanage et al., Green Chem. Vol. 5, Year 2003, page 71; Appl. Catal. A: Gen Vol. 219, Year 2001, page 259; Chang et al., Appl. Catal. A: Gen Vol. 263, Year 2004, page 179; Jiang and Yang Catal. Lett. Vol. 95, Year 2004, page 127) but the yields of dialkyl carbonates are very poor. US patent no. 6,835,858 describes the preparation of organic carbonates over Zn supported catalysts at 100°C, 25 bar pressure and space velocity WHSV = 5 g/g/h. But the yield of dialkyl carbonate is low and leaching of Zn from the solid was detected. US patent no. 6,479,689 tells a method for continuously producing of dialkyl carbonate and diol wherein dialkyl carbonate yields of 99% could be obtained but then catalyst separation was an issue. US patent no. 6,392,078 details the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from urea and methanol using homogenous tin alkoxide catalyst. US patent no. 6,407, 279 describes the synthesis from epoxide, monohydric alcohol and CO2 using a homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst. In other words, the prior art processes have one or more of the following disadvantages: (1) difficulties in catalyst separation, lower efficiency of the catalyst, catalyst stability during reaction, lower yields of dialkyl carbonates etc.<br>
The present invention deals with a process, which eliminates all the above said drawbacks of the prior-art processes. It deals with production of dialkyl carbonates which comprises reacting of a cyclic carbonate with an alcohol over a solid, reusable double metal cyanide catalyst. One of the metals of the double metal cyanide catalyst is a Lewis acid metal ion such a Zn2+ while the other is a basic metal ion such as Fe. Co-existence of Zn and Fe in the active site linking through cyano-bridges makes catalyst efficient to transform cyclic carbonates into dialkyl carbonates. The catalyst could be separated easily by centrifugation or simple filtration and reused in several recycling experiments with little loss in activity/selectivity. Most importantly, the catalyst is highly efficient and only a small amount (~5 wt% of cyclic carbonate) is needed to carryout the reaction. The process is atom-efficient and the reaction conditions like temperature and pressure are moderate.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for production of dialkylcarbonate using an efficient heterogenous catalyst.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of dialkyl carbonates from cyclic carbonates and alcohols in the presence of a solid catalyst in high selectivity and yields.<br>
Yet another object is to describe a process for producing dialkyl carbonates at moderate reaction conditions.<br>

DEATIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the investigations leading to the present invention, it was found that the Fe-Zn double metal cyanide catalysts are highly efficient and could be easily separated from the products for further reuse. The prior art catalysts, mineral acid, alkali bases and lipases needed additional expenses and efforts for catalyst separation. An easily separable catalyst system e.g., the catalyst of the present invention is more advantageous. The solid catalyst of the present invention is not only efficient but avoids the tedious process of catalyst recovery characteristic of the prior art processes.<br>
The solid double metal cyanide complex catalyst used comprises of Zn and another transition metal (M) coordinated through cyanide bridging-groups has the molecular formula:<br>
