				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Weaving machine<br>
The present invention relates to a weaving machine, and more<br>
particularly refers to a weaving machine provided with a device<br>
for correcting the distortion of the weft, that is a machine<br>
able to eliminate the aberrations of perpendicularity between<br>
the weft and warp.<br>
As those skilled in the art know, a weaving machine comprises<br>
among other things, besides various structural and supporting<br>
parts, two temples consisting of rollers whose axis is parallel<br>
to the weft threads at the lateral edges of the cloth to be<br>
produced, and a smooth or threaded cylindrical cloth-deflecting<br>
bar, on which the said cloth presses, as soon as it is gathered,<br>
around an arc of contact before winding around a haul-off roll,<br>
in contact with which are one or more back-up rolls to draw the<br>
cloth off.<br>
The said two temples perform the function of keeping the cloth<br>
taut during and after insertion of the warp threads, and to this<br>
end exert a pressure on the cloth, pressing it against a support<br>
surface. This arrangement of the parts means that the tension<br>
exerted on the cloth by the abovementioned haul-off roll due to<br>
the back-up rolls has effects which, in the areas where the said<br>
temples are installed, are very different from those which occur<br>
in the remaining areas of the cloth, that is in the central<br>
area.<br>
In this area the cloth, coming under the said tension of the<br>
haul-off roll, stretches longitudinally, that is at right angles<br>
to the weft, to a considerably greater extent than in the areas<br>
near the temples, where the deformation of the cloth is opposed<br>
by the action of the temples themselves. As a consequence of<br>
this, the lines of the weft threads are not perfectly straight,<br><br>
and comprise a central section which is basically<br>
straight and then leads into two lateral sections which<br>
inflect towards the point on which the temples press.<br>
This means that the lateral areas of the cloth are<br>
practically unusable because of the non-<br>
perpendicularity of the weft and warp with respect to<br>
each other. Because this lack of perpendicularity<br>
affects both lateral edges of the cloth for a length of<br>
at least 10 cm, a total of some 20 cm of the cloth has<br>
to be discarded, which, with current cloth sizes,<br>
corresponds to some 15% of the width of a fabric.<br>
The economic damage caused by this problems, which is<br>
intrinsic to the modes of operation of a weaving<br>
machine, will be obvious.<br>
In the present state of the art the only operation<br>
carried out to correct the distortions described above<br>
is to apply differential tensions to the cloth by a<br>
manual or other type of operation, and this operation<br>
means unacceptable additional costs. More importantly,<br>
with some types of cloth it is simply impossible to<br>
perform this operation: for example in cloths on which<br>
paints, resins or the like are spread in the course of<br>
processing, it is impossible to correct the distortions<br>
that occur during the actual weaving process.<br>
However, the inventor of the present innovation<br>
realized that, if differential tension could be applied<br>
to the cloth downstream of the temples, with a<br>
magnitude that varies from area to area so as to<br>
compensate for the distortions described above, it<br>
would be possible to restore exact perpendicularity<br>
between the warp and the weft. This can indeed be done<br>
by exerting less tension on the central part of the<br>
cloth, which has already been stretched to a greater<br>
extent, than that exerted on the lateral areas around<br>
the temples.<br><br>
Because the magnitude of this tension depends, all other<br>
conditions being equal, on the shape and area of the arc of<br>
contact of the cloth on the cloth-deflecting bar, the inventor<br>
conceived the idea of varying this arc of contact in the<br>
different areas of the cloth by appropriate shaping of the cross<br>
section of the terminal portions of the cloth-deflecting bar,<br>
affecting the length involved in the abovementioned distortions,<br>
which may be estimated to be about 25 cm.<br>
By this means it is possible, for a certain coefficient of<br>
friction and for a predetermined tension exerted by the haul-off<br>
roll, to "stretch" the fabric in the warp direction with a<br>
differential effect in its different areas, being greater in the<br>
lateral areas affected by the temples. In order to enable the<br>
same cloth-deflecting bar to be used for cloths with different<br>
properties of compactness, elasticity and coefficient of<br>
friction, the inventor also, as will be explained later, makes<br>
provision for the shaped terminal portions of the cloth-<br>
deflecting bar to be able to be rotated with respect to the<br>
cylindrical central part of the bar, so that, by exploiting the<br>
special geometrical form of the cross section of the said<br>
terminal portions, it is possible to modify the shape and/or<br>
amplitude of the said arc of contact, as well as the direction<br>
in which the fabric moves away from the said cloth-deflecting<br>
bar.<br>
The subject of the present invention therefore consists of a<br>
weaving machine comprising at least two temples whose axis is<br>
parallel to the weft threads and which are located at the<br>
lateral edges of the cloth, a generally cylindrical cloth-<br>
deflecting bar on which the cloth presses around an arc of<br>
contact before winding around a haul-off roll on which one or<br><br>
more back-up rolls press, the said cloth-deflecting bar<br>
being composed of a central cylindrical portion which connects<br>
coaxially on either side with two terminal portions next to the<br>
areas where the said temples are installed, the said two<br>
terminal portions having throughout their length a cross section<br>
which varies in shape proceeding from their ends adjacent to the<br>
said central portion towards their free ends in such a way that<br>
the position, shape and/or amplitude of the said arc of contact,<br>
when proceeding in the same direction, vary, causing a variation<br>
in the tension transmitted to the corresponding areas of the<br>
cloth by the haul-off roll, such that it varies from a minimum<br>
value at the said ends of the terminal portions adjacent to the<br>
central portion to a maximum value at their free ends,<br>
characterized in that the said two terminal portions of the<br>
cloth-deflecting bar are separated by the central cylindrical<br>
portion and are connected to it coaxially in such a way that<br>
they can rotate about the common axis, and fixing means are<br>
fitted to reversibly clamp the terminal portions when they have<br>
rotated through a desired angle with respect to the said central<br>
cylindrical portion.<br>
A more detailed description will now be given of a preferred<br>
illustrative embodiment of the weaving machine according to the<br>
invention, with reference also to the accompanying drawings,<br>
which show :<br>

cloth-deflecting bar, with the arrangement of the<br>

-	in Figure 6, an end view of one terminal portion of<br>
the cloth-deflecting bar of the machine of the<br>
invention; and<br>
-	in Figure 7, a side view of the same terminal portion<br>
as in Figure 4.<br>
Taking Figure 1 to begin with, this shows only the<br>
essential parts of a weaving machine 1 according to the<br>
invention. This machine comprises, like machines of<br>
known type, two temples 2 (in the drawing only one of<br>
these is visible) on either side of the cloth 5, which<br>
press the cloth 5 to keep it stretched during weaving,<br>
against two shaped supports 10 referred to as "cloth<br>
supports". Downstream of the abovementioned temples 2<br>
the cloth runs around an arc of contact αi on the outer<br>
surface of a cloth-deflecting bar 6, before winding,<br>
through a winding angle βi around a haul-off roll 7,<br>
against which one or more back-up rolls or<br>
cylinders 8, 9 press.<br>
With conventional cloth-deflecting bars, which are<br>
cylindrical all the way along their length, the<br>
diagram, Figure 2, shows what happens to the weft<br>
threads 3i and warp threads 4i, as already mentioned:<br>
because of the tension applied uniformly by the<br><br>
haul-off roll 7 along the whole length of the<br>
cloth-deflecting bar 6, the area of the cloth 5 next to<br>
the temples 2 is held back by the pressure of the<br>
latter on the cloth supports 10, and in these areas the<br>
stretching of the cloth, which does occur in the<br>
central area of the said cloth 5, is resisted. This<br>
produces an aberration in the parallelism between the<br>
weft threads 3i, which in the said areas next to the<br>
temples 2 are not perpendicular to the warp threads 4i.<br>
In the machine 1 of the invention, to avoid this<br>
problem and its consequences as described above, the<br>
cloth-deflecting bar 6 is composed of a central<br>
cylindrical portion 6t (for which see Figure 3) which<br>
connects on either side with two terminal portions 6d,<br>
6e of length L approximately equal to 25 cm, the cross<br>
section of which terminal portions varies throughout<br>
their length L, from a circular shape at the ends E, D<br>
adjacent to the central portion 6t to an asymmetrical<br>
shape, eccentric with respect to the common axis of<br>
rotation N-N, at the free ends A, B.<br>
This particular sequence of the shapes of the cross<br>
section of the terminal portions 6d, 6e of the cloth-<br>
deflecting bar 6 has the effect of continuously<br>
changing the shape and amplitude of the arc of contact<br>
αi and its position (due to how far it projects from<br>
the axis N-N) with respect to the haul-off roll 7.<br>
This effect is shown more clearly in Figures 4 and 5:<br>
whereas in the situation of Figure 4 the tension caused<br>
on the cloth 5 by the haul-off roll 7 in the cross-<br>
sectional position depicted has a minimum value Tm equal<br>
to that of the tension applied to its central portion<br>
6t, in the situation shown in Figure 5 this tension<br>
reaches, at the free ends of the terminal portions 6d,<br>
6e, a maximum value TM. The result is a gradual<br>
compensation, cross section by cross section, of the<br>
effects of the distortion generated in the course of<br><br>
weaving by imparting to the areas of the lateral edges<br>
of the cloth a gradual "stretching" which restores the<br>
parallelism between the weft threads 3i and hence their<br>
perpendicularity with respect to the warp threads 4i<br>
through the whole length of the cloth 5. For the<br>
distribution of tension values in the different areas<br>
of the cloth-deflecting bar 6, see Figure 3.<br>
Because of the fact that, depending on the type of<br>
cloth and its elasticity and coefficient of friction,<br>
different diagrams of tension in the warp thread<br>
direction may be necessary, the invention provides for<br>
forming the said two terminal portions 6d, 6e as<br>
separate parts that can be connected on opposite sides,<br>
coaxially, to the central portion 6t, and which can be<br>
rotated about the common axis N-N (Figure 3) with<br>
respect to the said central portion 6t, and then be<br>
fixed in a desired relative position by reversible<br>
fixing means of known type, such as for example fixing<br>
screws 8 which, when tightened, press on the stationary<br>
spindle on which both the terminal portions 6d, 6e and<br>
the central portion 6t are mounted.<br>
Due to the asymmetry of the shape of the different<br>
cross sections of a terminal portion constructed as<br>
described earlier, the rotation of the said terminal<br>
portion with respect to its longitudinal axis also<br>
brings about a variation in the shape, amplitude and<br>
position of the said arc of contact αi at each of its<br>
cross sections, with the result that precise<br>
adjustments can be made by turning the terminal<br>
portions 6d, 6e, while the machine 1 is running, until<br>
it can be seen by eye that the distortions leading to<br>
the aberrations of perpendicularity between the weft<br>
threads 3i and warp threads 4i have been eliminated.<br>
The effect of these operations on a machine 1 according<br>
to the invention can be seen in Figure 2: the three<br>
weft threads 3i drawn at the bottom have clearly been<br>
returned to the correct geometrical form which they had<br><br>
upstream of the temple 2 (the direction of translation<br>
of the cloth 5 is indicated by the arrow V).<br>
The geometry of the differing cross sections of a<br>
terminal portion can be determined from assessments of<br>
the type of cloth and the type of processing, and a<br>
designer can therefore design the envelope of the<br>
outline of the cross sections which he considers the<br>
most appropriate. In a solution suggested by the<br>
inventor, shown in Figures 6 and 7 for one terminal<br>
portion 6e only, the latter has a cross section which<br>
is circular at the end D adjacent to the central<br>
portion 6t, which has an identical radius R, and joins<br>
that of the free end B via an envelope of lines<br>
generated by removal of material which reduces the<br>
distance of a part of the outline from the said radius<br>
R to a lower value Q, and increases the radius of<br>
curvature of the said outline from R to infinite when<br>
proceeding from the said end D to the free end B.<br>
The axis of rotation (which as already explained<br>
coincides with the axis N-N of the central portion 6t)<br>
is also made in such a way as to pass through the<br>
centre of the said circular cross section of the end D<br>
adjacent to the central portion 6t, and eccentric with<br>
respect to the cross section of the other end B, so<br>
that the distance from one part of the outline of the<br>
latter to the axis of rotation N-N varies continuously<br>
from the said value R to the said lower value Q.<br>
With a weaving machine constructed in accordance with<br>
the present invention it is possible simply and quickly<br>
to correct the distortions of the cloth described<br>
above, particularly the distortion of perpendicularity<br>
between the weft and warp, thus achieving the<br>
inventor's initial objects.<br><br>
