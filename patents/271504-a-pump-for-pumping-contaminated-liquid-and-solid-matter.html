A PUMP<br>
Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the<br>
field of pumps for sewage or waste water, and more<br>
specifically to a pump for pumping unscreened contaminated<br>
liquid including solid matter, such as plastic materials,<br>
hygiene articles, textile, rags, etc. Said pump comprises a<br>
pump housing provided with a rotatable impeller suspended<br>
in a drive shaft and having at least one vane, and an<br>
impeller seat, at least one part of the impeller and the<br>
impeller seat being movable in the axial direction in<br>
relation to each other.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In sewage stations, septic tanks, wells, etc., it<br>
often occur that solid matter or pollutants, such as socks,<br>
sanitary pads, paper, etc., clogs the submersible pump that<br>
is lowered into the basin of the system. The contaminations<br>
are sometimes too big to pass through the pump if the<br>
impeller and the impeller seat are located at a fixed<br>
distance from each other.<br>
In order to get rid of the clogging matter, it is<br>
known to equip centrifugal pumps with means for cutting up<br>
the solid matter into smaller pieces and thereafter<br>
evacuate the small pieces together with the pumped liquid.<br>
However, the cutting up of the solid matter is energy<br>
intensive, which is adverse especially since pumps of this<br>
kind usually operates for long periods of time. Another<br>
conventional way of getting rid of clogging matter is to<br>
use an impeller having only one vane, which present one<br>
large throughput channel capable of letting through the<br>
solid matter. One drawback with this type of pump is that<br>
the solid matter often get tangled around the leading edge<br>
of the vane. A third attempt, to solved the problem of<br>
large solid matter clogging the pump, use a arrangement in<br><br>
2<br>
which the impeller is at a fixed distance from the impeller<br>
seat, e.g. 30-40 mm. A huge drawback is that the pump has a<br>
really low efficiency all the time.<br>
A better way of solving the problem of solid<br>
matter clogging the pump should be to admit the impeller<br>
and the impeller seat to be movable in the axial direction<br>
in relation to each other, in order to form a gap. But<br>
known pumps comprising this feature uses said gap for other<br>
purposes. Furthermore, they only admit a small gap between<br>
the impeller and the impeller seat. In EP 1,247,990 is<br>
shown a pump, the impeller of which is movable in the axial<br>
direction in relation to the impeller seat along the longi-<br>
tudinal direction of the drive shaft. But the movability is<br>
strongly limited and the object solved is only to admit<br>
operational start in a dry state, e.g. now liquid in the<br>
pump. GB 751,908 shows a pump having a manually controlled<br>
movability of the impeller in relation to the impeller<br>
seat. The object of this construction is to admit a<br>
regulation of the efficiency of the pump. US 6,551,058<br>
shows a pump having an impeller which is movable in the<br>
axial direction in relation to the drive shaft. The object<br>
of the shown construction is to avoid the vanes of the<br>
impeller to be damaged if solid matter enters the pump.<br>
More precisely, none of the abovementioned, or<br>
other, documents present a solution, or an object, usable<br>
for letting through large pieces of solid matter. Even<br>
though small pieces of solid matter might pass through the<br>
gap that is formed between the lower edge of the impeller<br>
and the impeller seat, it is more likely that large pieces<br>
of solid matter will get stuck in the narrow gap formed. In<br>
a worst case scenario, the impeller might get totally<br>
jammed and thus seriously damage the pump. Such an<br>
unintentional shutdown is costly, due to expensive,<br>
cumbersome and unplanned maintenance work. It is even<br>
better if the solid matter blocks the inlet of the pump<br>
than the solid matter gets jammed between the vane of the<br><br>
3<br>
impeller and the impeller seat. If the inlet is blocked the<br>
only effect is that less fluid will get pumped through the<br>
pump, but if the impeller is jammed the pump might get<br>
damaged.<br>
A closely related patent, EP 1,357,294 directed to<br>
the applicant, shows a pump which is exposed for solid<br>
matter included in unscreened sewage water. The pump has a<br>
groove in the top surface of the impeller seat for<br>
transportation of the entire contaminating subject towards<br>
the periphery of the pump housing. However, it is strictly<br>
described that the impeller shall not be movable in<br>
relation to the impeller seat, due to the object of<br>
scraping of solid matter from the vane against the edge of<br>
the groove.<br>
Furthermore, submergible pumps are used to pump<br>
fluid from basins that are hard to get access to for<br>
maintenance and the pumps often operate for long periods of<br>
time, not infrequently up to 12 hours a day or more.<br>
Therefore it is highly desirable to provide a pump having<br>
long durability.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention aims at obviating the afore-<br>
mentioned disadvantages of previously known pumps, and at<br>
providing an improved pump. A primary object of the present<br>
invention is to provide an improved pump of the initially<br>
defined type, which in a reliable way admits large solid<br>
matter to pass through the pump, without having to cut up<br>
the solid matter into smaller pieces. It is another object<br>
of the present invention to provide a pump with respect to<br>
the reduce friction between the impeller and the drive<br>
shaft in the axial direction, in order to get a better<br>
movability of the impeller. It is yet another object of the<br>
present invention to provide a pump having an improved<br>
durability, thanks to a reduced friction in the interface<br><br>
4<br>
between the impeller and the drive shaft, and by that a<br>
more reliable control of the impeller during movement.<br>
According to the invention at least the primary<br>
object is attained by means of the initially defined pump<br>
having the features defined in the independent claim.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention are further<br>
defined in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the present invention, there is pro-<br>
vided a pump of the initially defined type, which is<br>
characterized in that the impeller seat presents at least<br>
one groove in the top surface thereof.<br>
Thus, the present invention is based on the<br>
insight of the importance that a movability of the impeller<br>
in the axial direction a distance too short in relation to<br>
the size of the solid matter brings about other and even<br>
worse problems than preventing the fluid to be pumped. More<br>
precisely, it is important to undoubtedly remove solid<br>
matter from the gap between the vane of the impeller and<br>
the impeller seat.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the groove extends in a spiral shape from a<br>
centrally located open channel in the impeller seat to the<br>
periphery thereof, along the direction of rotation of the<br>
impeller. This means that if the leading edge of the vane<br>
of the impeller hit a piece of solid matter, the solid<br>
matter will get forced outwards towards the impeller seat<br>
as a consequence of the centrifugal force and that the<br>
leading edge of the vane is back swept. When the solid<br>
matter meets the groove in the top surface of the impeller<br>
seat it will follow the shape of the groove outwards and at<br>
the same time lift the impeller from the impeller seat, and<br>
thus quickly be passed through the pump.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the impeller<br>
may be moved a great distance from the impeller seat,<br>
preferably as much as the diameter of the open channel of<br><br>
5<br>
the impeller seat. Then the ability to pass solid matter<br>
through the pump is considerably increased.<br>

abovementioned and other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will be apparent from the following<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention<br>
Figs 1 and 2 show an impeller 1 and an impeller<br>
seat 2, usually accommodated in a pump housing of a pump<br>
(not shown). The other parts of the pump are removed for<br>
the sake of simplicity of reading the figures. The<br>
invention relates to pumps in general, but in the preferred<br><br>
6<br>
embodiment the pump is constituted by a submergible<br>
centrifugal pump.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
the impeller seat 2 is constituted by an insert releasably<br>
connected to the pump housing by being located in a seat in<br>
the pump housing in such a way that the insert cannot<br>
rotate relative to the pump housing. The impeller 1 is<br>
suspended in a drive shaft 3 extending from above, and is<br>
rotatable in the pump housing. The first, upper end (not<br>
shown) of the drive shaft 3 is connected to the engine of<br>
the pump. The second, lower end of the drive shaft 3 is<br>
connected to the impeller 1 by means of a joint in such a<br>
way that the impeller 1 is movable in the axial direction<br>
along the drive shaft 3, but rotates jointly with the drive<br>
shaft 3. Preferably the drive shaft 3 is inserted in a<br>
centrally located hub 4 of the impeller 1.<br>
Reference is now also made to figs 5 and 6. The<br>
impeller 1 comprises at least one vane 5 extending from the<br>
hub 4 towards the periphery of the impeller 1, preferably<br>
in a spiral shape.<br>
The direction of rotation of the impeller 1 is<br>
clockwise in the shown embodiments, and the vanes 5 are<br>
extending in the opposite direction, i.e. counter<br>
clockwise. In the shown embodiment the impeller 1 has two<br>
vanes 5, each having an extension running approximately 270<br>
degrees around the hub 4, but it shall be pointed out that<br>
the number of vanes 5 and the length of the vanes 5 may<br>
vary greatly, in order to suit different liquids and<br>
applications. For example, each vane may extend in a<br>
straight line radially outwards from the hub. Each vane 5<br>
comprises a leading edge 6 and a lower edge or tip surface<br>
7. The leading edge 6 is located directly above a centrally<br>
located open channel 8 of the impeller seat 2 and the lower<br>
edge 7 of the vane 5 is located above a top surface 9 of<br>
the impeller seat 2.<br><br>
7<br>
In the top surface 9 of the impeller seat 2 and<br>
contiguous to the open channel 8 of the impeller seat 2, is<br>
provided at least one groove or relief groove 10. The<br>
groove 10 extends from the open channel 8 of the impeller<br>
seat 2 towards the periphery thereof. Preferably in a<br>
spiral shape that sweeps outwards in the direction of<br>
rotation of the impeller 1, i.e. in an opposite direction<br>
to the one of the vanes 5. The number of grooves 10 and<br>
their shape and orientation may vary greatly, in order to<br>
suit different liquids and applications. The function of<br>
the groove 10 is to guide the solid matter outwards to the<br>
periphery of the pump housing. As the solid matter passes<br>
through the pump, some will fasten underneath the vanes 5<br>
of the impeller 1 and slow down the rotating motion of the<br>
impeller 1 and even stop the same. But the groove 10<br>
contribute to keep the vanes 5 clean, by scraping of the<br>
solid matter each time the vane 5 passes the same. If the<br>
solid matter is to big to fit in the groove 10, between the<br>
impeller 1 and the impeller seat 2, the impeller 1 will be<br>
moved upwards away from the impeller seat 2 by the solid<br>
matter and thereby admitting the solid matter to pass<br>
through the pump.<br>
The shape of the lower edge 7 of the vane 5 corre-<br>
sponds, in the axial direction, to the shape of the top<br>
surface 9 of the impeller seat 2. The axial distance<br>
between the lower edge 7 and the top surface 9 ought to be<br>
less than 1 mm when the impeller 1 is in the first, lower<br>
position shown in fig 1. Preferably said distance is less<br>
than 0,7 mm and most preferably less than 0,5 mm. At the<br>
same time said distance shall be more than 0,1 mm and<br>
preferably more than 0,3 mm. If the impeller 1 and the<br>
impeller seat 2 are to close to each other a frictional<br>
force or a breaking force acts on the vanes 5 of the<br>
impeller 1.<br>
In order to ensure that the open channel 8 does<br>
not get clogged, the impeller seat 2 is preferably provided<br><br>
8<br>
with means for guiding the solid matter towards the groove<br>
10. The guiding means comprises at least one guide pin 11<br>
extending from the top surface 9 of the impeller seat 2,<br>
more precisely from the part of the top surface 9 facing<br>
the open channel 8. The guide pin 11 extends generally in<br>
the radial direction of the impeller seat 2 and is located<br>
below the impeller 1 and presents an upper edge 12, which<br>
extends from a position contiguous to the most inner part<br>
of the vane 5 of the impeller 1 to the top surface 8 of the<br>
impeller seat 2. More precisely, the most inner part of the<br>
upper edge 12 of the guide pin 11 is located at<br>
approximately the same radial distance from the center of<br>
the impeller 1 as the most inner part of the vane 5 of the<br>
impeller 1. Preferably the upper edge 12 of the guide pin<br>
11 terminates adjacent to the "inlet" of said groove 10.<br>
The axial distance between the upper edge 12 of the guide<br>
pin 11 and the leading edge 6 of the vane 5 ought to be<br>
less than 1 mm, when the impeller 1 is in the first, lower<br>
position. Furthermore, the upper edge 12 of the guide pin<br>
11 corresponds to and is located adjacent to the leading<br>
edge 6 of the vane 5 of the impeller 1.<br>
The axial movability between the impeller 1 and<br>
the impeller seat 2 should be any appropriate length<br>
depending on the application, i.e. from 0 mm and upwards.<br>
Preferably said movability should be at least 15 mm, more<br>
preferably at least 40 mm, and most preferably at least as<br>
much as the diameter of the open channel 8. In the shown<br>
embodiment the diameter of the open channel 8 is 150 mm.<br>
Furthermore, the axial movability may be achieved in a lot<br>
of ways but in a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention the impeller 1 is movable along the axial<br>
direction of the drive shaft 3.<br>
Reference is now made to figs 3 and 4. In fig 3 is<br>
shown a joint of the pump admitting axial movability of the<br>
impeller 1 in relation to the drive shaft 3, at the same<br>
time as the drive shaft 3 transmits a turning motion to the<br><br>
9<br>
impeller 1. The joint comprises a socket 13 provided in the<br>
central hub 4 of the impeller 1, and connected to the<br>
impeller 1 by means of bolts (not shown), or the like.<br>
Alternatively the socket 13 may be integrated with the<br>
impeller 1. The socket 13 presents a cavity 14 in a central<br>
part thereof, which cavity 14 accommodate the second, lower<br>
end of the drive shaft 3. In the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention the drive shaft 3 is provided with a<br>
sleeve 15 at the second, lower end thereof, the sleeve 15<br>
being connected to the drive shaft 3 by means of a bolt 16<br>
and/or key and keyway, or the like. Alternatively the<br>
sleeve 15 may be integrated with the drive shaft 3.<br>
The sleeve 15 has a first, upper part having a<br>
first external diameter, which is essentially equal to the<br>
internal diameter of a flange 17 of the socket 13. Further-<br>
more, the sleeve 15 has a second, lower part having a dia-<br>
meter larger than said first diameter of the sleeve 15. The<br>
diameter of the second part of the sleeve 15 is essentially<br>
equal to the internal diameter of the cavity 14. Due to<br>
these dimensional relationships the impeller 1 is suspended<br>
in the drive shaft 3. The cavity 14 presents a larger<br>
extension in the axial direction than the second part of<br>
the sleeve 15, the socket 13 and the impeller 1 being<br>
movable a distance essentially equal to that difference.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention the joint<br>
comprises at least one discrete element 18 arranged at the<br>
interface between the socket 13 or impeller 1 and the<br>
sleeve 15 or the drive shaft 3. The element 18 imperatively<br>
transmits a turning motion from the drive shaft 3 to the<br>
impeller 1 and admits the impeller 1 to move along the<br>
drive shaft 3. The socket 13 is provided with a recess 19<br>
for each element 18, the recess 19 extending in the axial<br>
direction of the drive shaft 3. In the sleeve 15, opposite<br>
to the recess 19 of the socket 13, is formed an interacting<br>
recess 20, which together with the recess 19 of the socket<br>
13 accommodate said element 18. In fig 3 the right element<br><br>
10<br>
18 is removed in order to get a general view of the<br>
recesses 19, 20. In fig 4 the left and right element 18 are<br>
removed. Preferably only two elements 18 are used and the<br>
dimensions of the elements 18 are determined by the torque<br>
being transmitted from the drive shaft 3 to the impeller 1.<br>
In the shown embodiment in figs 1-4 the discrete element is<br>
constituted by a bar, preferably a circular bar, due to a<br>
manufacturing point of view.<br>
It shall be pointed out that in an alternative<br>
embodiment the discrete element 18 can be constituted by a<br>
number of balls following the recess 19 of the sleeve 15 as<br>
the impeller 1 moves in the axial direction. More<br>
precisely, the recess 19 of the sleeve 15 has upper and<br>
lower obstructions that prevent the balls from escaping<br>
into the cavity 14. Alternatively, the discrete element 18<br>
may be integrated with the inner surface of the sleeve 15,<br>
i.e. ridges on the inner surface extending into the<br>
recesses 19 of the socket 13.<br>
The relative movability of the impeller 1 along<br>
the drive shaft 3 may alternatively be realized by means of<br>
a spline joint between the impeller 1 and the drive shaft<br>
3, shown in figs 7 and 8. One advantage of using a spline<br>
joint is that the joint will comprise fewer elements.<br>
The impeller 1 is, in a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, freely movable along the drive shaft<br>
3 since there are no springs or the like obstructing the<br>
movement. More precisely, any force from a solid matter on<br>
the impeller 1 from underneath that overcomes the high<br>
pressure on the top side of the impeller 1 will manage to<br>
raise the impeller 1 from the impeller seat 2. When the<br>
solid matter is removed the impeller 1 automatically will<br>
return to the lower position according to fig 1 since the<br>
pressure on the top side of the impeller 1 is higher than<br>
the pressure on the bottom side of the impeller 1.<br>
Alternatively, the impeller 1 may, when the pump<br>
is about to be started, be biased to the upper position<br><br>
11<br>
according to fig 2 by means of a spring. Not until the pump<br>
is started and the liquid starts to flow the impeller 1<br>
will move towards the impeller seat 2. This will prevent<br>
the impeller 1 from shaking inside the pump housing during<br>
transportation. In addition, the starting torque for the<br>
impeller 1 is lowered since the impeller 1 and the impeller<br>
seat 2 are well distanced from each other.<br>
If a large piece of solid matter enters the open<br>
channel 8 of the impeller seat 2, it is too large to get<br>
in-between the vane 5 of the impeller 1 and the top surface<br>
9 of the impeller seat 2. But the groove 10 in conjunction<br>
with the vane 5 of the impeller 1 grabs hold of the solid<br>
matter and forces it to "climb" over the top surface 9 of<br>
the impeller seat 2 along the groove 10.<br>
Finally, it shall be pointed out that the most<br>
preferred number of grooves 10 is one. Furthermore, the<br>
pump shall preferably comprise one guide pin 11. Otherwise<br>
the open channel 8 should be too obstructed, which would<br>
adversely affect the function of the pump.<br>
Feasible modifications of the Invention<br>
The invention is not limited only to the embodi-<br>
ments described above and shown in the drawings. Thus, the<br>
pump, or more precisely the impeller seat may be modified<br>
in all kinds of ways within the scope of the appended<br>
claims.<br>
It shall be pointed out that instead of the<br>
impeller being movable along the drive shaft the axial<br>
movability may be achieved in a lot of ways, e.g. both the<br>
drive shaft and the impeller may be movable away from the<br>
impeller seat, or the impeller seat may be movable away<br>
from the impeller, or both the impeller and the impeller<br>
seat may be movable away from each other. In addition, only<br>
