AERATED PRODUCTS WITH REDUCED CREAMING<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
AERATED PRODUCTS WITH REDUCED CREAMING<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, such as food products, that include         hydrophobins, and which exhibit reduced creaming.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
A wide variety of foods contain an introduced gas such as air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide. Typically, food foams are unstable over periods of time   in excess of several days (i.e. bubbles will grow and the foam will collapse) unless the product is frozen (e.g. ice cream) or unless the continuous phase of the product is gelled (e.g. mousse).<br>
Currently, it is difficult to prepare an aerated product where the foam is stable   over a shelf life of several weeks which, with some agitation if necessary, will then flow. There are two aspects that need to be considered: (a) the stability of the bubbles over several weeks; (b) prevention of the rise of air bubbles to the surface due to the buoyancy difference between the two phases (termed creaming). Creaming can lead to a poor appearance of a product and loss of   performance. For example, if a foam creams then the bubbles can become less stable and air can be lost. Furthermore, a "phase separated" product can look much less desirable to the consumer.<br>
Ideally, such an aerated product would contain a foam where the bubbles remain       stable to growth and creaming, yet on application of a relatively small amount of agitation (e.g. shaking, stirring or sucking), the product will flow.<br>
There are a number of mechanisms that degrade the quality of an aerated product: Disproportionation and coalescence lead to bubble growth, changing   product properties, such as its texture and physical appearance. Creaming (due to the buoyancy of the air bubbles) leads to vertical phase separation in the container resulting in a large proportion of bubbles close to the upper surface and<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
the depletion of bubbles at the bottom. There are aerated food products where creaming is desirable, e.g. the foam on the surface of beer. However, for aerated products requiring a foam life-time beyond a few minutes or hours (e.g. those requiring a shelf-life), creaming leads to an undesirable appearance. It can also   lead to subsequent air loss due to the closer packing of the bubbles in the foam and the foam collapse that may result there from.<br>
To design a product were creaming is prevented and the bubbles within the foam remain stable over an extended shelf-life (from 1 week to at least 3 or more  weeks at chill), there are two pre-requisites: The continuous phase requires either an apparent yield stress or must be visco-elastic to prevent bubbles rising due to buoyancy. The bubbles within the foam must be stable to disproportionation and coalescence throughout the product life-time.<br>
       Summary of the invention<br>
In our co-pending application WO 06 / 010425, we have found that a fungal protein termed hydrophobin allows the production of foam with excellent stability to disproportionation and coalescence. Hydrophobin is an aerating agent that we have found to provide excellent stability to the foam due to its surface active 20 nature. Hydrophobin also appears to confer a highly viscoelastic nature to the surface of the air bubbles. This leads to good stability to disproportionation and coalescence.<br>
We have now found that the use of hydrophobin in combination with stabilisers   that provide an apparent yield stress to the continuous phase lead to aerated products that also show good stability to creaming in excess of 3 weeks when kept at chill temperatures. In contrast, a combination of stabilisers with other surface active agents, such as sodium caseinate, instead of hydrophobin did not result in a stable foam.<br><br>
To slow the rate of creaming in a foam produced using hydrophobin as the surface active aerating agent, a continuous phase needs to be designed with a viscosity or yield stress.  The former will only slow the rate of creaming (through<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
Stoke's law), even if the viscosity is made very high. Use of a continuous phase with a yield stress, however, can lead to a situation where creaming is prevented, yet with a relatively small amount of agitation, the product will shear thin and flow.<br>
      Accordingly, the present invention provides a flowable aerated composition comprising hydrophobin and a yield stress agent, the composition having a continuous phase viscosity, measured at a shear rate of 10 s"\ of from 0.01 to 2000 Pa s, and a continuous phase apparent yield stress of at least 4 Pa.<br>
       In one embodiment, the hydrophobin is in a substantially isolated form.<br>
Preferably, the hydrophobin is present in an amount of at least 0.001 wt%, more preferably at least 0.01 wt%.<br>
        Preferably the hydrophobin is a class II hydrophobin.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the yield stress agent is a polysaccharide, more preferably a bacterial polysaccharide, such as xanthan and/or gellan.<br>
        In one embodiment, the aerated composition comprises a thickener.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the aerated composition is pourable.<br>
Preferably the aerated composition is an aerated food product, such as a chilled       food product.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a hydrophobin and a yield stress agent for inhibiting creaming in a flowable aerated composition.<br>
        In a related aspect the present invention provides a method of inhibiting creaming in an aerated composition which method comprises adding hydrophobin and a yield stress agent to the composition prior to and/or during aeration of the composition.<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g. in   chilled confectionery/frozen confectionery manufacture, chemistry and biotechnology). Definitions and descriptions of various terms and techniques used in chilled/frozen confectionery manufacture are found in Ice Cream, 4th Edition, Arbuckle (1986), Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, NY. Standard techniques used for molecular and biochemical methods can be found in   Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd ed. (2001) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1999) 4th Ed, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. - and the full version entitled Current Protocols in Molecular Biology).<br>
        Hydrophobias<br>
Hydrophobins are a well-defined class of proteins (Wessels, 1997, Adv. Microb. Physio. 38: 1-45; Wosten, 2001, Annu Rev. Microbiol. 55: 625-646) capable of self-assembly at a hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, and having a conserved sequence:<br>
 	Xn-C-X5.9-C-C-X11.39-C-X8-23-C-X5.9-C-C-X6-18-C-Xm   (SEQ ID NO. 1)<br>
where X represents any amino acid, and n and m independently represent an integer. Typically, a hydrophobin has a length of up to 125 amino acids. The cysteine residues (C) in the conserved sequence are part of disulphide bridges. In the context of the present invention, the term hydrophobin has a wider meaning to   include functionally equivalent proteins still displaying the characteristic of self-assembly at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface resulting in a protein film, such as proteins comprising the sequence:<br>
Xn-C-X1-5o-C-Xo-5-C-X1.100-C-X1-100-C-X1-5o-C-Xo-5-C-X1-5o-C-Xm (SEQ ID No. 2)<br>
       or  parts  thereof  still  displaying  the  characteristic  of  self-assembly   at  a<br>
hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface resulting in a protein film. In accordance with<br>
the definition of the present invention,  self-assembly can be detected by<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
adsorbing the protein to Teflon and using Circular Dichroism to establish the presence of a secondary structure (in general, a-helix) (De Vocht et al., 1998, Biophys. J. 74: 2059-68).<br>
     The formation of a film can be established by incubating a Teflon sheet in the protein solution followed by at least three washes with water or buffer (Wosten et al., 1994, Embo. J. 13: 5848-54). The protein film can be visualised by any suitable method, such as labeling with a fluorescent marker or by the use of fluorescent antibodies, as is well established in the art. m and n typically have<br>
       values ranging from 0 to 2000, but more usually m and n in total are less than 100 or 200. The definition of hydrophobin in the context of the present invention includes fusion proteins of a hydrophobin and another polypeptide as well as conjugates of hydrophobin and other molecules such as polysaccharides.<br>
        Hydrophobins identified to date are generally classed as either class I or class II. Both types have been identified in fungi as secreted proteins that self-assemble at hydrophobilic interfaces into amphipathic films. Assemblages of class I hydrophobins are relatively insoluble whereas those of class II hydrophobins readily dissolve in a variety of solvents.<br><br>
Hydrophobin-like proteins have also been identified in filamentous bacteria, such as Actinomycete and Steptomyces sp. (WO01/74864). These bacterial proteins, by contrast to fungal hydrophobins, form only up to one disulphide bridge since they have only two cysteine residues. Such proteins are an example of functional 25 equivalents to hydrophobins having the consensus sequences shown in SEQ ID Nos. 1 and 2, and are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The hydrophobins can be obtained by extraction from native sources, such as filamentous fungi, by any suitable process. For example, hydrophobins can be 30 obtained by culturing filamentous fungi that secrete the hydrophobin into the growth medium or by extraction from fungal mycelia with 60% ethanol. It is particularly preferred to isolate hydrophobins from host organisms that naturally secrete hydrophobins.   Preferred hosts are hyphomycetes (e.g. richoderma),<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
basidiomycetes and ascomycetes. Particularly preferred hosts are food grade organisms, such as Cryphonectria parasitica which secretes a hydrophobin termed cryparin (MacCabe and Van Men, 1999, App. Environ. Microbiol 65: 5431-5435).<br><br>
Alternatively, hydrophobins can be obtained by the use of recombinant technology. For example host cells, typically micro-organisms, may be modified to express hydrophobins and the hydrophobins can then be isolated and used in accordance with the present invention.  Techniques for introducing nucleic acid<br>
        constructs encoding hydrophobins into host cells are well known in the art. More than 34 genes coding for hydrophobins have been cloned, from over 16 fungal species (see for example W096/41882 which gives the sequence of hydrophobins identified in Agaricus bisporus; and Wosten, 2001, Annu Rev. Microbiol. 55: 625-646).   Recombinant technology can also be used to modify<br>
       hydrophobin sequences or synthesise novel hydrophobins having desired/improved properties.<br>
Typically, an appropriate host cell or organism is transformed by a nucleic acid construct that encodes the desired hydrophobin. The nucleotide sequence coding<br>
        for the polypeptide can be inserted into a suitable expression vector encoding the necessary elements for transcription and translation and in such a manner that they will be expressed under appropriate conditions (e.g. in proper orientation and correct reading frame and with appropriate targeting and expression sequences). The methods required to construct these expression vectors are well known to<br>
         those skilled in the art.<br>
A number of expression systems may be used to express the polypeptide coding sequence. These include, but are not limited to, bacteria, fungi (including yeast), insect cell systems, plant cell culture systems and plants all transformed with the 30 appropriate expression vectors. Preferred hosts are those that are considered food grade - 'generally regarded as safe' (GRAS).<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT7EP2006/008989<br><br>
Suitable fungal species, include yeasts such as (but not limited to) those of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Hansenula, Candida, Schizo saccharomyces and the like, and filamentous species such as (but not limited to) those of the genera Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Mucor, Neurospora, Fusarium and<br>
      the like.<br>
The sequences encoding the hydrophobins are preferably at least 80% identical at the amino acid level to a hydrophobin identified in nature, more preferably at least 95% or 100% identical. However, persons skilled in the art may make 10 conservative substitutions or other amino acid changes that do not reduce the biological activity of the hydrophobin. For the purpose of the invention these hydrophobins possessing this high level of identity to a hydrophobin that naturally occurs are also embraced within the term "hydrophobins".<br>
        Hydrophobins can be purified from culture media or cellular extracts by, for example, the procedure described in WO01/57076 which involves adsorbing the hydrophobin present in a hydrophobin-containing solution to surface and then contacting the surface with a surfactant, such as Tween 20, to elute the hydrophobin from the surface.   See also Collen et al., 2002, Biochim Biophys<br>
        Acta. 1569: 139-50; Calonje et al., 2002, Can. J. Microbiol. 48:1030-4; Askolin et al., 2001, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 57: 124-30; and De Vries et al., 1999, Eur J Biochem. 262: 377-85.<br>
Flowable aerated compositions and products<br>
        By the terms "flowable composition" or "flowable product", which are used interchangeably herein, we mean a composition where the composition will flow following a relatively small amount of agitation (e.g. shaking, stirring or sucking), as opposed to a solid or set composition. Flowable compositions include pourable compositions and semi-set compositions. The temperature at which the<br>
       flowability of the composition or product is considered is the temperature at which the product is normally served. For example, flowability of a chilled product is typically determined at 5°C whereas flowability of an ambient product is typically determined at room temperature (20°C). Flowability of ice-containing products is<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
typically determined at -10°C. Measurements are generally carried out at 1 atm pressure.<br>
The term "aerated" means that gas has been intentionally incorporated into the   product, such as by mechanical means. The gas can be any gas, but is preferably, particularly in the context of food products, a food-grade gas such as air, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The extent of aeration is typically defined in terms of "overrun". In the context of the present invention, %overrun is defined in volume terms as:<br>
          ((volume of the final aerated product - volume of the mix) / volume of the mix)<br>
X100<br>
The amount of overrun present in the product will vary depending on the desired product characteristics. For example, the level of overrun in confectionery such as mousses can be as high as 200 to 250%. The level of overrun in some chilled is products, ambient products and hot products can be lower, but generally over 10%, e.g. the level of overrun in milkshakes is typically from 10 to 40%.<br>
Preferably the level of overrun is at least 10%, more preferably at least 25 or 50%. Preferably the level of overrun is less than 400%, more preferably less than       300 or 200%.<br>
Preferably, the foam is substantially homogeneous.<br>
Preferably an aerated composition of the invention will retain at least 50% of its     original air phase volume, more preferably 75%, for a period of at least 3 weeks, more preferably at least a month (typically measured after storage at chill temperatures (ca. 5°C)).<br>
           Preferably, the average bubble diameter in the composition will not change<br>
   appreciably over a period of 3 weeks (typically measured after storage at chill<br>
temperatures {ca. 5°C)) from the average size when it was initially prepared at<br>
time t = 0.  Preferably, the relative average bubble diameter (dr) will change less<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
than a factor of 2.5 over a period of 3 weeks, and more preferably less than a factor of 2. The relative bubble diameter (dr) at time = t is as determined in the examples through the equation:<br>
Where do is the average diameter immediately after preparation, i.e. t = 0, and dt is the average bubble diameter at time = t.<br>
        A suitable method for measuring changes in bubble size and foam volume is by using a light scattering technique. The Turbiscan TLab measurement system (Formulaction, France) can conveniently be used, which analyses both the backscattered and transmitted light from the aerated sample of interest.<br>
        The foam to be analysed is contained within a cylindrical sample cell (e.g. having a diameter of 25 mm filled with 20 ml of foam). A light source of wavelength X -880nm is used to supply the incident light, and two optical sensors receive the light transmitted through the sample (180° from the incident light) and back scattered light (45° from the incident light) from the sample. In scanning mode,<br>
       the optical sensors scan the height of the tube acquiring both transmitted and backscattered data as a function of sample height and time. Therefore, migration phenomena (such as creaming) and changes in particle size (such as bubble size) can be monitored over time. Relevant theory and examples of the use of the Turbiscan measurement system can be found in: Mengual et al., Colloids and<br>
      Surfaces A, 1999, 152, 112-123; Rouimi et al., Food Hydrocolloids, 2005, 19, 467-478; Also, application notes and useful information can be obtained from the manufacturer's website: www.turbiscan.com<br>
Experimentally, average bubble size changes are best observed by variations in<br>
   the backscattered light through an area of the sample where other changes (such<br>
as foam collapse or bubble creaming) are not occurring.  Here, we used central<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
areas of the foam. The backscattering level (BS) is linked to the photon transport mean free path, V, through the foam by the relation:<br>
l* is dependent upon the gas volume fraction, <t>, and the bubble mean diameter d      through:<br>
Q and g are both optical parameters from Mie theory, where Q is the scattering efficiency factor and g is an asymmetry factor.   For a foam of known volume fraction of air, the change in the average bubble diameter can be monitored over 10    time. This is calculated automatically through the Turbiscan software.<br>
Exact measurement parameters that can be used are stated in the Examples.<br>
Foam stability (volume of foam as a function of time) and extent of creaming can    also be determined by a visual method by observing these phenomena in foams sampled into measuring cylinders.<br>
Preferably, the extent of creaming is such that after storage at three weeks at 5°C, the visible serum layer lying below the aerated liquid that forms at the bottom<br>
       of the product container due to the depletion of air bubbles in the region through creaming does not make up more than 25% of the total product height within the container. More preferably it does not make up more than 15 or 20% of the total product height within the container. This is preferably measured using a visual method by observing this phenomenon in foams sampled  into measuring<br>
        cylinders.<br>
Aerated food products of the invention typically fall into one of three groups -<br>
ambient (i.e. products stored and/or served at room temperature without the<br>
requirement for refrigeration/freezing), chilled or partially frozen (i.e. typically<br>
      containing ice).   The term "food" includes beverages.    Chilled aerated food<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
products include smoothies and tea. Partially frozen aerated food products include ice-containing drinks and other ice-containing products that are flowable at -10°C (see, for example, our co-pending application WO 06 / 010426).<br>
In one embodiment, the food product is a confectionery product.<br>
Yield Stress Agents<br>
The required yield stress, viscosity and viscoelastic nature will not only depend upon the need to prevent creaming, it will also be dependent upon the type of   aerated product of interest. In one embodiment, this is a pourable foam which will have a yield stress and a relatively low viscosity on shearing (i.e. shear thinning). For example, a viscosity of less than 1 Pa s within the shear regime 10 to 100 s'1.<br>
The formulation requires a yield stress agent or agents, which we define here as   an ingredient or ingredients (molecular or particulate) that provide an apparent yield stress to the continuous phase, thus slowing or preventing creaming of the air bubbles. Yield stress agents can also increase the viscosity at zero shear or during flow. On mild agitation (e.g. brief shaking or mixing), however, the product will flow or pour because the continuous phase exhibits shear thinning behaviour.<br><br>
Compositions of the invention will have a continuous phase apparent yield stress of at least 4 Pa, preferably at least 4.2, 4.5 or 5 Pa. In one embodiment, the continuous phase apparent yield stress is less than 1 MPa, preferably less than 100,000 Pa. Continuous phase apparent yield stress for a composition of the    invention can be determined as set out in the Examples.<br>
Compositions of the invention will also have a continuous phase viscosity, measured at a shear rate of 10 s"\ of from 0.01 to 2000 Pa s, preferably less than 1000 Pa s, more preferably less than 500, 200 or 100 Pa s. Continuous phase 30 viscosity for a composition of the invention can be determined as set out in the    Examples.<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
The temperature at which the flowability, apparent yield stress and viscosity of the composition or product is considered is the temperature at which the product is normally served. For example, for a chilled product these parameters are typically determined at 5°C whereas for an ambient product these parameters are 5 typically determined at room temperature (20°C) and for an ice-containing product these parameters are typically determined at -10°C. Measurements are generally carried out at 1 atm pressure.<br>
Suitable ingredients that can be used as the yield stress agents, particularly in 10    food systems, include gelling polysaccharides, some non-limiting examples of which are summarised below:<br>
-	Thermoreversible gelling biopolymers such as gelatine, iota- and kappa-<br>
carrageenan, and agar.<br>
-	Chemically set gelling biopolymers which derive their gel structure from<br>
        is     an interaction between the polysaccharide and an appropriate ion such as Ca2*.<br>
Examples include sodium alginate and pectin.<br>
-	Bacterial polysaccharides such as xanthan or gellan that can form weak<br>
gel-like behaviour which is disrupted by shear. Preferably such polysaccharides<br>
are added to give a final amount of at least 0.4 wt% in the pre-aerated mix.<br>
  	- Fungal polysaccharides such as schizophyllan.<br>
-	Synergistic gels that comprise of two or more biopolymers that may be<br>
individually non-gelling, but on mixing will form a gel or a gel of a higher modulus.<br>
Examples include: sodium alginate with pectin, xanthan with locust bean gum,<br>
agar with locust bean gum, and kappa carrageenan with locust bean gum.<br><br>
A number of the yield stress agents described above are used conventionally to gel products such that they are set, e.g. gelatine. In the context of the present invention, to ensure that the resulting product is flowable, they will typically be included at lower levels.<br><br>

WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
Gelling polysaccharides are not the only ingredients that can be used as yield stress agents in the context of this invention.   Any ingredient (molecular or particle) that results in an apparent yield stress of the continuous phase can be       used. Other examples of yield stress agents include:<br>
-	Lipogels. These include, but are not limited to, polyglycerol esters of saturated<br>
fatty acids, and blends of monoglycerides of fatty acids with citric acid esters of<br>
saturated fatty acids, lactic acid esters of saturated fatty acids, or diacetyl tartaric<br>
       acid esters of saturated fatty acids. Typically, the amount of Iipogel ingredient would be less than about 2-5 wt% in the pre-aerated mix. Examples of how to produce lipogels can be found in Heertje et al., Food Science and Technology, 1998,31,387-396.<br>
       - Gelling proteins (thermally or chemically), e.g. whey protein.<br>
-	Oil in water emulsions where the dispersed oil particles interact with one<br>
another such as to provide the continuous phase with a gelled nature.<br>
       - Fibres e.g. of fruit or vegetable origin, modified cellulose etc.<br>
Non-gelling ingredients that increase continuous phase viscosity (thickness)<br>
In addition to the above mentioned yield stress agents, thickeners may also be added to increase the viscosity of the pre-aerated mix, thus allowing control of the 25 flow properties of the aerated product on use. These do not give rise to a yield stress when used individually but will contribute to the overall thickness and flow behaviour of the product. They need, however, to be used in combination with a yield stress agent or agents. Such thickeners might be used to increase the "body" of an aerated milk shake on consumption, for example.<br><br>
Non-limiting examples of thickeners are: non gelling starch, whey protein, locust bean gum, guar gum, gum arabic, or carboxy methyl cellulose. Thickening or viscosifying of the pre-aerated mix may also be achieved using a number of other<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
molecule or particle routes. For example, addition of fruit or vegetable pulp, high molecular weight sugars such as corn syrup, or use of proteins, e.g. whey protein. Some emulsion based systems can also be made to thicken for example: whipped toppings and creams. Lipogels can also be used below the 5     concentration required to form a yield stress.<br>
The yield stress agent(s), and thickeners where present, are selected and added in amounts suitable to give a product, prior to aeration, having the desired apparent yield stress and viscosity, as discussed above.<br><br>
Aerated food products may optionally contain other ingredients such as one or more of the following: other proteins such as dairy proteins, either as pure ingredients or as liquid ingredients, e.g. milk or cream; oil or fat, notably in the form of an emulsified phase; sugars; salts; colours and flavours; chemical is emulsifiers, such as monoglycerides, tea or coffee; fruit or vegetable purees / extracts / juice; stabilisers or thickeners, such as polysaccharides; preservatives; inclusions, such as nuts, fruit, toffees.<br>
For aerated non-food products, in addition to hydrophobin and an appropriate 20    thickening agent, other ingredients may be included to create the specific type of product. These include, but are non limited to:<br>
-	Anionic, cationic, and non-ionic surfactants.<br>
-	Fatty acids such as stearic and palmitic acid and fatty acids of mono- / di-or tri- glycerides.<br>
 	- Acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide<br>
-	Preservatives, e.g. benzoic acid<br>
-	Sugar alcohols, e.g. glycerol and sorbitol<br>
-	Polymers such as PEGs and carbomer<br>
           The amount of hydrophobin present in the product will generally vary depending on the product formulation and volume of the air phase. Typically, the product will contain at least 0.001 wt%, hydrophobin, more preferably at least 0.005 or 0.01 wt%. Typically the product will contain less than 1 wt% hydrophobin.    The<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
hydrophobin can be from a single source or a plurality of sources e.g. the hydrophobin can a mixture of two or more different hydrophobin polypeptides.<br>
Preferably the hydrophobin is a class II hydrophobin.<br><br>
The present invention also encompasses compositions for producing an aerated product, typically a food product, of the invention, which composition comprises a hydrophobin and a yield stress agent. Such compositions include liquid premixes, for example premixes used in the production of chilled or partially   frozen confectionery products, and dry mixes, for example powders, to which an aqueous liquid, such as milk or water, is added prior to or during aeration.<br>
The compositions for producing a chilled or partially frozen product of the invention, will comprise other ingredients, in addition to the hydrophobin and yield   stress agent, which are normally included in the product, e.g. in the case of food products, sugar, fat, emulsifiers, flavourings etc. The compositions may include all of the remaining ingredients required to make the product such that the composition is ready to be processed, i.e. aerated, to form an aerated product of the invention.<br><br>
Dry compositions for producing an aerated product of the invention will also comprise other ingredients, in addition to the hydrophobin and yield stress agent, which are normally included in the product, e.g. in the case of food products, sugar, fat, emulsifiers, flavourings etc. The compositions may include all of the<br>
        remaining non-liquid ingredients required to make the product such that all that the user need only add an aqueous liquid, such as water or milk, and the composition is ready to be processed to form an aerated product of the invention. These dry compositions, examples of which include powders and granules, can be designed for both industrial and retail use, and benefit from reduced bulk and<br>
        longer shelf life.<br>
The hydrophobin is added in a form and in an amount such that it is available to stabilise the air phase.   By the term "added", we mean that the hydrophobin is<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
deliberately introduced into the product for the purpose of taking advantage of its foam stabilising properties. Consequently, where ingredients are present or added that contain fungal contaminants, which may contain hydrophobin polypeptides, this does not constitute adding hydrophobin within the context of      the present invention.<br>
Typically, the hydrophobin is added to the product in a form such that it is capable of self-assembly at an air-liquid surface.<br>
       Typically, the hydrophobin is added to the product or compositions of the invention in an isolated form, typically at least partially purified, such as at least 10% pure, based on weight of solids. By "added in isolated form", we mean that the hydrophobin is not added as part of a naturally-occurring organism, such as a mushroom, which naturally expresses hydrophobins.   Instead, the hydrophobin<br>
       will typically either have been extracted from a naturally-occurring source or obtained by recombinant expression in a host organism.<br>
In one embodiment, the hydrophobin is added to the product in monomeric, dimeric and/or oligomeric (i.e. consisting of 10 monomeric units or fewer) form. 20 Preferably at least 50 wt% of the added hydrophobin is in at least one of these forms, more preferably at least 75, 80, 85 or 90 wt%. Once added, the hydrophobin will typically undergo assembly at the air/liquid interface and therefore the amount of monomer, dimer and oligomer would be expected to decrease.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the hydrophobin is added to the aerated compositions of the invention in an isolated form, typically at least partially purified.<br>
The combination of hydrophobin and one or more yield stress agents can be used<br>
      both to stabilise the air phase in an aerated flowable composition (generally by<br>
inhibiting bubble coarsening, i.e. hydrophobins have been found not only to<br>
stabilise foam volume but also the size of the bubbles within the foam) and to<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
inhibit creaming in the composition by imparting suitable Theological properties to the continuous phase.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention can be applied to set or frozen aerated   compositions, where creaming is a problem in the time required for the product to set or freeze. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method for inhibiting creaming in a set or frozen aerated composition prior to setting or freezing of the composition, which method comprises adding hydrophobin and a yield stress agent to the composition prior to or during setting or freezing of the 10 product. Preferably the time taken for the product to freeze or set is greater than 1 hour. In a preferred embodiment the product, immediately after aeration, has a continuous phase viscosity of less than 100 Pa.<br>
The present invention will now be described further with reference to the following           examples which are illustrative only and non-limiting.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Experimental Methodologies<br>
       Here we describe the basis of the experimental methods used to measure the foam properties and the solution rheology of products that are encompassed within this invention. The exact experimental parameters chosen for measurement are described in the Example.<br>
         Measurements of Foam Stability, Bubble Size, and Creaming<br>
Our principal method of measuring changes in bubble size and extent of creaming in foamed samples were by using a light scattering technique. We used the Turbiscan TLab measurement system (Formulaction, France), which analyses<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
both the backscattered and transmitted light from the aerated sample of interest. This is described in more detail above.<br>
We also observed foam stability (volume of foam as a function of time) and extent 5     of creaming by a visual method by observing these phenomena in foams sampled into measuring cylinders.<br>
Measurement of continuous phase viscosity and apparent yield stress<br>
A measure of the continuous phase viscosity and the apparent yield stress of the<br>
        unaerated mixes was determined by use of rheology. Exact experimental details are summarised in the Examples. To determine a measure of the apparent yield stress and a zero shear viscosity of the mixes from the log shear stress versus log viscosity data, the shear thinning regime of the curves were fitted to a Hershel-Bulkily model.    We consider the apparent yield viscosity to be the<br>
       minimum shear stress that causes the onset of shear thinning. This is a common method used by those skilled in the art. Useful references that describe this behaviour can be found in Stokes and Telford (Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 2004, 124, 137-146) and Barnes, Hutton, and Walters (An Introduction to Rheology, Rheology Series 3, Elsevier Science, 1989).<br><br>

Preparation and Analysis of the Aerated Products<br>
Mix preparation<br>
All mixes were made in 100g batches. For Mixes A, B and C (containing sodium caseinate and skimmed milk powder, respectively), the protein and xanthan gum were blended and added slowly into stirred water at room temperature. The solutions were subsequently heated (to 55°C for Na Cas and to 40°C for SMP) to ensure that proteins were properly hydrated. The mixes were cooled and stored 10     at 5°C until further use.<br>
Mix G was prepared by blending the xanthan gum powder and PGE powder together, dispersing in cold de-ionised water and then heating to 60°C with stirring for 30 minutes. This solution was then cooled and stored at 5°C until    further use.<br>
For Mixes D, E, and F (containing HFB II), the xanthan was first dispersed into cold water with stirring for at least 30 minutes. Then, the required concentration of HFB II was added to this as an aliquot. The solution was then gently sonicated 20 in a sonic bath for 30 seconds to fully dissolve the HFB II. The mix was cooled and stored at 5°C until further use.<br>
The high levels of Na Caseinate and SMP were chosen as the protein concentrations are proportionate with the levels found in commercially sold milk       shake drinks.<br>
Aerating Process<br>
80 mL of mix was sheared in a stirred pot apparatus (cooled to 5°C) at a rate of<br>
1200 rpm for a timed duration that corresponded to obtaining 100% overrun.<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
Aeration times to reach 100% overrun are summarised in Table 3. The stirred pot equipment consists of a cylindrical, vertically mounted, jacketed stainless steel vessel with internal proportions of 105mm height and diameter 72mm.<br>
       The rotor used to shear the sample consists of a rectangular impeller of the correct proportions to scrape the inner surface of the vessel as it rotates (dimensions 72mm x 41.5mm). Also attached to the rotor are two semi-circular (60mm diameter) high-shear blades positioned at a 45° angle to the rectangular attachment.   Post aeration, samples were stored at 5°C in 100mL measuring<br>
         cylinders or standard Turbiscan vials before further analysis.<br><br>

       Viscosity and Apparent Yield Stress Measurements<br>
Rheological measurements were made using an AR-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments Ltd, Crawley, UK). Stepped flow experiments were performed on un-aerated mixes to determine viscosity versus shear stress and viscosity versus shear rate curves.   All measurements were carried out at 5°C (using peltier-<br>
        controlled cooling). A cone and plate geometry was used. The cone was made of stainless steel and was 6mm in diameter with a 2° angle. From these data, plots of viscosity as a function of shear stress and viscosity as a function of shear rate could be determined. Using the Hershel Bulkley model (which fits to data at the high shear stress end of the data), an apparent yield stress can be determined.<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
Measurement of Foam and Bubble Stability and Extent of Foam Creaming The stability of the foam and the bubbles therein was measured using the Turbiscan TLab, the operating details of which were discussed previously. This enables the determination of the following as a function of time: (1) The foam   volume (i.e. measurement of overall air phase loss). (2) The average bubble size. (3) The extent of creaming in the foam.<br>
The produced foam was dosed into a Turbiscan glass sample tube up to a height of about 42 mm, corresponding to approximately 20 mL of foam. The equipment<br>
        then scans and measures both the backscattered and transmitted light between the height of 2 and 55 mm. Measurements were taken over a period of several weeks. Since data is collected over the full sample height, from this, the mean values of the backscattering profiles between defined limits (lower and upper height) give specific information with respect to changes in the sample in that area, e.g. bubble size or creaming.<br>
Bubble size: From the backscattered data measured between 20 and 30 mm, the average bubble size was calculated automatically from the backscattered light. The refractive indices were taken as those of water and air.   The air phase<br>
        volume fraction of the foam was 0.5. Although the air phase volume fraction of the foam can change over time, particularly if it is not stable and creaming takes place, we found that taking measurements between 20 and 30 mm height of the sample gave reliable size data unless the foam was very unstable. If the foam was highly unstable, then the size data needs to be treated with caution in a<br>
        quantitative sense but can be compared with that of other foams.<br>
Foam creaming: The extent of creaming in the foam was measured by two methods.<br>
       1. Light scattering using the Turbiscan: The amount of foam creaming over time was determined by measuring the change in backscattered light over time between the sample height of 0 to 10 mm. As the foam creams, the backscattering intensity between these heights will be expected to decrease,<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
since more light will be backscattered in the presence of air bubbles. These data were obtained principally for the HFBII foams because the stability of the bubbles means that the changes in backscattering can be attributed solely to changes in the volume of air bubbles within a region of the sample cell. For less stable s foams that exhibit both rapid bubble growth and creaming, it is more difficult to quantitatively de-convolute the two since both processes occur at the same time.<br>
Visual observations in a measuring cylinder. 100 ml_ of produced foam were placed in a 100 ml_ measuring cylinder and the top covered with cling film to 10 prevent drying of the top of the foam. The height of the foam and the height of serum (continuous phase) as the foam creams over time were recorded. Even when bubble growth and serum separation (creaming) occur at the same time, the extent of creaming can be quantitatively stated.<br>
      		Results and Discussion<br>
Viscosity and Yield Stress of Mixes<br>
The viscosity and the yield stress of the mix is important in preventing or controlling the rate of bubble creaming. Therefore, in formulating aerated 20 products where creaming is arrested, it is appropriate to make some analysis of the rheology to aid in predictive capability. Here we describe some of the main rheological features of Mixes D, E, and F, containing 0.1 wt% HFBII and 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3 wt% xanthan in the solution, respectively.<br>
         Figures 1 and 2 both show important rheological conditions for the enabling of pourable foams. The data in Figure 1 show the effect of xanthan concentration on the apparent yield stress and on the viscosity of the solution. Using the Hershel Bulkley model (which fits to data at the high shear stress end of the data), an apparent yield stress can be determined.  From the data, we calculate<br>
        for:<br>
0.3 wt% xanthan solution with 0.1% hydrophobin - apparent yield stress = 2.8 Pa 0.4 wt% xanthan solution with 0.1% hydrophobin - apparent yield stress = 4.5 Pa<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT7EP2006/008989<br><br>
0.5 wt% xanthan solution with 0.1% hydrophobin - apparent yield stress = 5.5 Pa<br>
The apparent yield stress is the main parameter that will govern the rate and extent of creaming. The data in Figure 2 shows the effect of xanthan 5 concentration on the viscosity of the mixes at high shear. We suggest that the viscosity of the mix at shear rates between 10 and 100 s*1 is comparable to the viscosity that would be experienced in flow or consumption. For each of the xanthan concentrations, the mix viscosity over the shear rate regime 10 to 100 s*1 is less than 1 Pa s.<br><br>
Bubble Stability<br>
The change in relative average bubble size (dr) of in the foams as a function of time are shown in Figure 3. In the case of HFBII, the bubbles are very stable and no change in average size is seen after several weeks storage at chill.   0.5%<br>
        PGE also shows good stability, although the average bubble size does gradually increase. Further, the level of PGE used (0.5 wt%) is higher than that normally permitted in foodstuffs. Each of the non-HFB proteins show poor stability. Rapid bubble growth occurs over just a few hours for each of the aerated mixes. Coarsening of these foams accelerates over the short life time, ultimately leading<br>
        to complete foam break down.<br>
Creaming of the Foam<br>
Figure 4 shows the changes in back scattering as a function of time over the height range 0 to 10mm in the sample vial. In the case of PGE and HFBII, where 25 the bubble sizes were shown to stay near constant over long periods of time (particularly with HFBII), it is apparent that the backscattering also does not change significantly. Only a small amount of creaming is observed over long time scales (over 1000 hours, which equates to in excess of one month).<br>
         In the case of the foams stabilised by the dairy proteins (SMP and Na Cas), interpreting the light scattering data is somewhat more complex since both creaming and bubble growth will occur concurrently. However, some general remarks can be made.   Using a concentration of 0.5% xanthan, at time = 0 the<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
bubbles are of comparable initial size to those made with HFBII. Therefore, we expect creaming to be inhibited at this point. However, bubble growth does occur (due to disproportionation and coalescence) leading to a decrease in the measured backscattering.  Ultimately, the bubbles will exceed a critical average<br>
      diameter and then they will start to cream as the buoyancy force exceeds the yield stress holding the bubbles in place. Although the presence of xanthan gum provides a yield stress to the system which is expected to prevent creaming of small bubbles (ca. 
       process, and further bubble growth, leads to an accelerating rate of decrease in the backscattering over time.<br>
Foam stabilised by HFB II clearly shows superior stability to any of the other surfactants investigated here.<br><br>
Effect of xanthan concentration (i.e. effect of apparent yield stress) The data presented in Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate the effect of xanthan concentration, and hence yield stress, on the extent of creaming in a foam consisting of stable bubbles produced using 0.1% HFBII.<br><br>
In Figure 5, it is clear that at 0.5% xanthan concentration, over a period of 1000+ hours, the bubble size in the sample area measured changes very little. Decreasing the concentration of xanthan to 0.4% leads to a small decrease in measured bubble size over long time periods. This is probably not due to bubble<br>
       shrinkage, but rather due to creaming of bubbles. The larger bubbles rise out of the measurement zone, leaving a larger proportion of bubbles in the measurement zone. This leads to an apparent decrease in average bubble size. The same effect is seen at 0.3% xanthan over a shorter time period. The effect is quicker due to the lower yield stress.  It should be highlighted, however, that the<br>
       changes observed at 0.4 and 0.5% xanthan concentrations are relatively small.<br>
The conclusions drawn from Figure 5 are further demonstrated in Figure 6. This shows the extent of creaming through the measured backscattering at the bottom<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT/EP2006/008989<br><br>
of the sample vial (0 to 10 mm). Clearly, at 0.5% xanthan, creaming is inhibited with only a small amount of visible serum layer apparent after over a month's storage. Creaming takes place more quickly and to a greater extent as the amount of xanthan is reduced and the yield stress is reduced. These changes       occur at the same time as the bubble size changes seen in Figure 5.<br>
The visual appearance of the aerated foams containing HFBII and xanthan after storage at 5°C are shown in Figures 7 and 8. It is clear that after extended storage time, using 0.5% xanthan as the thickening agent, bubble creaming is<br>
      almost entirely inhibited and only slight phase separation can be seen. Using 0.4% xanthan, there is a greater (although still only small) amount of creaming. Using 0.3% xanthan, the apparent yield stress is not great enough to prevent creaming over the storage time. This particular product would not be acceptable (the level of serum separation noted at the bottom of the vial exceeds 10% after 3<br>
       weeks), whereas using 0.4 and 0.5% xanthan would be acceptable (level of serum was less than 10% after 3 weeks).<br>
Accordingly, since the apparent yield stress of the continuous phase calculated above for 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5% xanthan is 2.8, 4.5 and 5.5 Pa, respectively, we have     determined that the minimum apparent yield stress should be at least about 4 Pa.<br>
Example 2: Aerated chocolate milkshake<br>
An aerated chocolate-flavoured milk shake was prepared as follows. A commercially available milkshake (Frm™ Thick Fresh Milkshake produced by<br>
        Dairy Crest Ltd, Shropshire, UK) was purchased. This is an unaerated product and, according to the ingredient list, contained: skimmed milk, whole milk, sugar, modified maize starch, fat reduced cocoa powder, buttermilk powder and stabilisers (carrageenan and guar gum). Xanthan gum was slowly added to the milk shake with stirring to a concentration of 0.5 wt %. This was then mixed for<br>
       20 minutes to allow the xanthan gum to hydrate fully. A known volume of 0.5 wt. % hydrophobin solution was aerated to 400% overrun using a hand held aerolatte™ device. This was added to the milk shake to give an aerated milkshake product with 100% overrun, an overall hydrophobin concentration of<br><br>
WO 2007/039064	PCT7EP2006/008989<br><br>
 0.9 wt % and an overall xanthan concentration of about 0.41 wt %. The aerated milkshake product was then stored at 5°C and its stability monitored over a period of three weeks. Figure 9 shows that after 3 weeks, the aerated milkshake product retained a stable air phase which did not cream or collapse and showed        <br>
        no significant bubble growth.<br>
Example 3: Aerated fruit smoothie<br>
An aerated fruit smoothie was prepared using a Vie Shots™ drink, produced by    Unilever UK as a fruit puree base. The Vie Shot™ contained: banana puree (28%), orange juice concentrate (26%), carrot juice concentrate (23%), pumpkin juice concentrate (14%), orange pulp (4%), lemon juice concentrate, acerola cherry concentrate (1.5%), and apple pectin. The pH was measured (at room temperature) to be 4.17. Xanthan gum was slowly added to the fruit puree with 15 stirring to a concentration of 0.5 wt %. This was then mixed for 20 minutes to allow the xanthan gum to hydrate fully. A known volume of 0.5 wt. % hydrophobin solution was aerated to 400% overrun using a hand held aerolatte™ device. This was added to the fruit puree to give an aerated fruit smoothie product with approximately 100% overrun, an overall hydrophobin concentration of 0.1 wt % 20 and an overall xanthan concentration of about 0.41 wt %. The aerated fruit smoothie product was then stored at 5°C and its stability monitored over a period of three weeks. Figure 10 shows that after 3 weeks the aerated fruit smoothie product retained a stable air phase and that no significant bubble growth or creaming occurred.<br><br>
