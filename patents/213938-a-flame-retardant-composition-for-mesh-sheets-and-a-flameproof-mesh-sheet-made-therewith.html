[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet used outdoors such as in a construction work site or engineering work site for a long time.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
A tendency toward an increase in the number of buildings having a large number of stories is lately seen in<br><br>
the construction industry. Meanwhile, there is an increase in the number of houses having a small number of stories.  It is obligatory to lay flameproof mesh sheets, flameproof mesh sheets for houses having a small number of stories and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets in tliese buildings for safety and regulations are becoming more and more strict.<br>
Currently used flameproof mesh sheets and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets are produced by weaving gray yarn prepared by coating polyester, nylon or polypropylene multi-filament fibers with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition and heating, and heating the obtained gray cloth, or by coating gray cloth prepared by weaving multi-filament fibers with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition and heating, and processing the obtained gray cloth to a desired shape.<br>
The resin composition for coating fibers and cloth comprises a chlorine-containing vinyl chloride resin as a resin and a chlorine-based flame retardant such as chlorinated paraffin, bromide-based flame retardant such as decabromodiphenyl oxide, or inorganic flame retardant such as antimony trioxide as a flame retardant (Examined Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 52-41786, 53-18065 and 61-9430, Plastics, February, 1991).<br>
In recent years, it has been globally demanded to avoid the use of resins and flame retardants containing elemental halogen which generates harmful gas at the time of combustion<br><br>
from the viewpoint of environmental preservation.<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 61-223045 proposes that red phosphorus and ammonium phosphate are kneaded into a polyolefin to prevent corrosion by halogen contained in a halogen-containing compound flame retardant. However, there is unknown a flame retardant prepared by dispersing ammonium polyphosphate or a metal hydroxide into an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl versatate copolymer or an ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer, or a dispersion consisting of the above dispersion and .a polyurethane aqueous dispersion.<br>
The inventor of the present invention previously proposed a halogen-free flame retardant comprising an aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin. Although,this flame retardant provides an excellent effect, a tendency toward an increase in its viscosity during storage by time changes is seen.<br>
The present inventor also proposed plreviously a halogen-free flame retardant containing an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer of 10 to 95 parts by weight of vinyl acetate and the balance consisting of ethylene as Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 9-312550.  Although this flame retardant provides excellent function and effect, a product thereof has a red tint because red phosphorus is used and it is difficult to color it opaque white or light -vivid color even by adding titanium oxide or<br><br>
the like. The present invention improves the color and flame retardancy of this invention.  An opaque white or light vivid color flameproof mesh sheet has been desired according to application field.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
It is an object of the present invention which has been made in view of the above situation to provide a flame retardant for halogen-free flameproof mesh sheets which does not experience an increase in viscosity during storage, can be colored any color, is lustrous and flexible, and does not generate harmful halogen gas at the time of combustion as well as a flameproof mesh sheet comprising the same.<br>

[0005]<br>
[Description of the Preferred Embodiments]<br>
The reason for the; use of an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer which is an olefin resin, an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl versatate copolymer or an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer as a base material in the present invention is to fully impregnate multi-filament fibers and cloth with a flame retardant to uniformly coat them with the flame retardant. The aqueous dispersion makes easy coating by impregnation.<br>
The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer used in the present invention is preferably a copolymer of 10 to 95 wt% of vinyl acetate and the balance consisting of ethylene.  The aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer preferably has a solid content of 25 to 75 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.1 to 15 pm, a viscosity of 50 to 9,000 cp and a pH of 4 to 9, as exemplified by V-200 and V-100 (of Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.), and S-200, S-467, S-500, S-706, S-455, S-752 and S-753 (of Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. ) .<br>
Since the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer has a -OCO-CH3 group and contains a lot of oxygen, the flame retarding effect thereof is large when it is used in combination of ammonium polyphosphate.  The ethylene-vinyl<br><br>
acetate-vinyl versatate copolymer used in the present invention is preferably a copolymer of 5 to 30 wt% of ethylene, 15 to 70 wt% of vinyl acetate and 25 to 75- wt% of vinyl versatate. The aqueous dispersion of the copolymer preferably has a solid content of 30 to 70 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.1 to 15 |im, a viscosity of 50 to 3,000 cp and a pH of 4 to 9, as exemplified by S-950 and S-951 (of Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd.),<br>
Since the ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl versatate copolymer also has a -OCO-CH3 group and a barsatic acid group, R1R2R3C-0C0-CH=CH2, and contains a lot of oxygen, the flame retarding effect thereof is large when it is used in combination of ammonium polyphosphate.<br>
[0006]<br>
The ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer used in the present invention is preferably a copolymer of 5 to 30 wt% of ethylene, 10 to 75 wt% of vinyl acetate and 20 to 85 wt% of acrylic ester. The aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer preferably has a solid content of 25 to 75 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.1 to 15 pm, a viscosity of 50 to 9,000 cp and a pH of 4 to 9, as exemplified by Polysol EF-421 and Polysol EF-221 (of Showa Kobunshi Co., Ltd.) and Sumiflex S-900, S-910 and S-920 (of Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd.).<br>
Since the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer has a -OCO-CH3 group and -COOH group and contains a lot of oxygen as well, the flame retarding effect thereof is<br><br>
large when it is used in combination of ammonium polyphosphate.<br>
[0007]<br>
A polyurethane having the main structure of a polyester, polyether or polycarbonate is used as the polyurethane. A polyurethane having the main structure of a polyester is preferred from the viewpoints of flexibility, water ; resistance, adhesion and the like.<br>
The polyurethane aqueous dispersion used in the present invention preferably has a solid content of 25 to 70 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.01 to 10 pm, a viscosity of 10 to 3,000 cp and a pH of 4 to 9, as exemplified by Despacol U-42 and Despacol KA8481 of Sumitomo Viel Urethane Co., Ltd., Adecabontiter HUX-380, Adecabontiter HUX-232, Adecabontiter HUX-290H, Adecabontiter HUX-350 and Adecabontiter HUX-386H of Asahi Denka Kogyo K.K. and Letan WB of Kansai Paint Co., Ltd.<br>
[0008]<br>
The ammonium polyphosphate compound used in the present invention is ammonium polyphosphate or amide polyphosphate. By using the microcapsulated ammonium polyphosphate compound, an increase in the viscosity of an aqueous dispersion can be reduced when the ammonium polyphosphate compound is mixed into an olefin aqueous dispersion resin.  Further, the flameproof mesh sheet is detached and washed to remove dirt after it is laid at a construction site and used for 4 to 8 months.  It is washed by immersing in hot water heated at about 40"C and containing a detergent for several hours.  The<br><br>
ammonium polyphosphate compound can be made hardly soluble in water and stable by microcapsulation. The ammonium polyphosphate compound has a phosphorus content of 15 to 35 % and an average particle diameter of 5 to 40 pm.<br>
The flame retardant of the present invention contains 40 to 130 parts by weight of an ammonium polyphosphate compound based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content.  When the amount of the ammonium polyphosphate compound is smaller than 40 parts by weight, the flame retarding effect thereof is small and when the amount is larger than 130 parts by weight, there is almost no improvement of the flame retarding effect. Therefore, it is not necessary to add a large amount of the ammonium polyphosphate compound.<br>
[0009]<br>
The flame retardant of the present invention comprehends a flame retardant which contains 3 to 30 parts by weight of an organic phosphoric ester based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the total resin solid content.  When the amount of the organic phosphoric ester is smaller than 3 parts by weight, the effect of improving flame retardancy is small and the improvement of luster and flexibility is small and when the amount is larger than 30 parts by weight, the improvement of flame retardancy is small and the final product becomes sticky disadvantageously.<br>
The organic phosphoric ester is preferably a phosphoric ester containing no halogen and having an elemental<br><br>
phosphorus content of 7 to 18 wt% and a viscosity (20" C) of<br>
10 to 150 cp. The organic phosphoric ester used in the<br>
present invention is preferably allyl phosphate-based because<br>
it has a flame retarding effect, compatibility with a resin<br>
and a platioialng effect. pi 0.5 tic; z.ii^<br>
[0010]<br>
When an ammonium polyphosphate compound is used as a flame retardant in the present invention, the ammonium polyphosphate compound thermally decomposes at the time of combustion and generates nitrogen gas which shut off oxygen. The ammonium polyphosphate compound promotes the carbonization of a polyolefin as a dehydration carbonization catalyst while it generates nitrogen-containing gas, thereby improving a flame retarding effect. When a polyolefin and a polyurethane are used in combination, the blending ratios of these to the ammonium polyphosphate and the organic phosphoric ester are based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content.<br>
[0011]<br>
When a metal hydroxide is further blended, a larger flame retarding effect is obtained advantageously.  Preferred examples of the metal hydroxide include magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, red phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate from the viewpoint of a multiplication effect. When a metal hydroxide is blended, the obtained product becomes hard but the phosphoric ester softens the product, thus preventing it from becoming hard advantageously. The metal hydroxide must<br><br>
be existent in an amount of 60 to 150 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content of the polyolefin and the polyurethane,<br>
When the amount of the metal hydroxide is smaller than-60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content, its effect of promoting flame retardancy is small. When the amount is larger than 150 parts by weight, the viscosity of the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer rises disadvantageously.<br>
[0012]<br>
As the aluminum hydroxide, for example, Hijilite H-42M and Hijilite H-43M (of Showa Denko K.K.) are used.<br>
As the magnesium hydroxide, for example, Kismer 5A (of Kyowa Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.) is used.<br>
[0013]<br>
A description is subsequently given of a flameproof mesh sheet comprising the flame retardancy of the present invention.<br>
The multi-filament fiber used in the present invention is one or more multi-filament fibers selected from polyester, nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene and vinylon fibers. A polyester fiber is preferred from the viewpoints of strength and heat shrinkage.<br>
The tensile strength of the multi-filament fiber is adjusted to 4 to 10 g/denier to increase the strength and reduce the weight of a flameproof mesh sheet, and the breaking extension thereof is adjusted to 14 to 45 % to<br><br>
increase the toughness of a flameproof mesh sheet and improve the drop impact energy absorption thereof.<br>
The multi-filament fiber has an equivalent single fineness of 3 to 17 denier, preferably 3 to 12 denier, particularly preferably 4 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 500 to 4,500 denier, preferably 1,000 to 3,500 denier, particularly preferably 1,500 to 3,000 denier.<br>
[0014]<br>
The multi-filament fiber used in cloth treated with a flame retardant after weaving has an equivalent single fineness of 2 to 13 denier, preferably 2 to 11 denier, particularly preferably 2.5 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 150 to 2,500 denier, preferably 200 to 2,000, particularly preferably 250 to 1,500 denier. The tensile strength of the multi-filament fiber is controlled to 4 to 10 g/denier to increase the strength and reduce the weight of a flameproof mesh sheet, and the breaking extension thereof is controlled to 14 to 45 % to increase the toughness of a flameproof mesh sheet and improve the drop impact energy absorption thereof.<br>
A flameproof mesh sheet which must have high strength and high toughness is prepared by paralleling 2 to 4 multi¬filament fibers and leno weaving or imitation gauging the fibers with a loom.  In the case of a scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheet, cloth is often made by plain weaving a single multi-filament fiber with a loom.  In the case of a flameproof mesh sheet for houses having a small number of stories, cloth is often made by plain weaving or leno weaving<br><br>
2 to 4 multi-filament fibers. The mesh length is preferably 10 to 140 warps/10 cm and 10 to 140 wefts/10 cm.<br>
[0015]<br>
As for the weight ratio of the solid content of the flame retardant to the multi-filament fiber and cloth, the solid content of the flame retardant is 60 to 500 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber and cloth.  When the solid content of the flame retardant is smaller than 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber or cloth, coating nonuniformity occurs and part of the texture of the rtiulti-filament fiber and cloth is exposed, thereby deteriorating appearance and reducing weatherability.  Flameproofness also deteriorates»  When the solid content is larger than 500 parts by weight, the obtained flameproof mesh sheet becomes heavy, thereby deteriorating handling properties disadvantageously,<br>
[0016]<br>
In the present invention, the types and amounts of a pigment, dye, plasticizer, ultraviolet absorber, optical stabilizer, antioxidant, stabilizer, coupling agent, defearning agent, dispersant, diluent, thickener, foaming agent, mildewproofing agent and the^TI)ce~~aH"'Tujrta^ selected and used in conjunction with the flame retardant,<br>
A description is subsequently given of a process for producing the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention. When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is<br><br>
produced using multi-filament fibers, the fibers are coated with a flame retardant through a sizing nozzle, and the leated and gelled coated yarn is taken up by a winder.  The ::oated yarn taken up by the winder is woven by a loom. The ibtnlnnd fnbrlo In int.ro(lu(^.od .lnt.o a  hnntlng furnaco nnd<br>

When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention Ls produced using cloth, multi-filament fibers are woven with 1 dobby loom to obtain gray cloth. After the gray cloth is Immersed in a tank filled with a flame retardant for mesh ;heets and passed through the tank, it is dried with an air )low and introduced into a heating furnace to carry out heat [elation to obtain coated gray cloth. To increase the amount &gt;f the flame retardant coated on the cloth, the cloth is mmersed in and passed through the tank filled with the flame etardant at least two times to produce coated gray cloth, he cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and subjected<br>

[Examples]<br>
The following examples are given to further illustrate he present invention.<br><br>
Excunple 1<br>
