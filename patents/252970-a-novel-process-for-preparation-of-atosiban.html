THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br>
"A NOVEL PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ATOSIBAN"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Cadila Healthcare Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Road, Ahmedabad 308 015, Gujarat India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel solution phase process for the preparation of   1 -(3-Mercaptopropionic   acid)-2-[3-(/?-ethoxyphenyl)-D-alanine]-4-L-threonine-8-L-ornithine oxytocin of formula 1 namely Atosiban. Atosiban is an oxytocin antagonist, which inhibits the effects of oxytocin in a female mammal. <br>
Background of the invention<br>
This    invention   relates    to    a    novel    process    for    the    preparation    of<br>
1-(3-Mercaptopropionic	acid)-2-[3-(p-ethoxyphenyl)-D-alanine]-4-L-threonine-8-L-<br>
ornithineoxytocin of formula i namely Atosiban.<br>
Atosiban is an N-blocked cyclic octapeptide that exhibits in vitro activity in the inhibition of posterior pituitary hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin. This compound is efficacious in inhibiting the uterine hyperactivity associated with preterm labor in female mammals.<br><br><br><br>

In terms of peptide synthetic methodology, two major synthetic techniques dominate current practice. These are synthesis in solution and synthesis in solid phase. Majority of synthetic strategies reported for Atosiban are in solid phase. Although biotech methods using recombinant DNA are also useful for peptide synthesis, but their applicability has limitations with unnatural D-amino acids. In Atosiban, one of the amino acid has D-configuration.<br>
Vasotocin derivatives were firstly reported by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Sweden in its US 4504469 which is incorporated as reference in its entirety. The synthetic strategy reported here is in solid state. US 5373089 discloses oxytocin antagonist and its process of preparation. The synthetic strategy used is also solid phase. WO 9501368 discloses improved synthesis of cyclic peptides, in which the starting material for preparing<br><br><br>
Atosiban has been synthesized using solid phase technique and the final product is obtained by partial solution phase, whose purity reported is only 90%.<br>
There are several draw backs associated with solid phase synthetic strategies reported in these prior arts for the synthesis of Atosiban e.g. difficult to synthesize on a large scale leading to lots of waste. Further in such a synthetic strategy, the isolation of intermediate compounds is not possible. Therefore, it is not possible to detect side reactions including incomplete deprotection and coupling reaction.<br>
In solution phase synthesis, the intermediate compounds can be isolated and characterised at every step which provides convenience in detection of side reaction including incomplete deprotection and coupling reaction. The unwanted side products can then be removed before proceeding any further.<br>
Further, this approach has the advantage of allowing chemist to know exactly which chemical species they are dealing with at any stage of the process. It is in light of this extensive background that the applicants entered their study in an attempt to discover a novel solution phase process for the preparation of l-(3-Mercaptopropionic acid)-2-[3-(p-ethoxyphenyl)-D-alanine]-4-L-threonine-8-L-ornithine oxytocin of the formula 1 namely Atosiban or its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt la. <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An embodiment of the present invention describes a novel solution phase process for the preparation of l-(3-Mercaptopropionic acid)-2-[3-(p-ethoxyphenyl)-D-alanine]-4-L-threonine-8-L-ornithine oxytocin of formula 1 namely Atosiban.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising Atosiban 1 or its pharmaceutically acceptable acetate salt la prepared according to the present invention and involves use of additives to avoid recemization and other side reaction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel solution phase process for the preparation of l-(3-Mercaptopropionic acid)-2-[3-(p-ethoxyphenyl)-D-alanine]-4-L-threonine-8-L-ornithine oxytocin of formula I namely Atosiban. This process involves novel synthetic strategies, which is operationally simple, and therefore offers opportunities for better industrial applicability.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention describes the synthesis of novel intermediates namely, Des-amino-Cys(SH)-D-Tyr(4-OEt)-IIe-Thr-Asn-Cys(SH)-Pro-Orn-Gly-NH2 (2), Des-amino-Cys(Bzl)-D-Tyr(4-OEt)-IIe-Thr-Asn-Cys(Bzl)-Pro-Orn(Tos)-Gly-NH2 (3), Boc-Asn-Cys(Bzl)-Pro-Orn(Tos)-Gly-NH2 (4), Boc-Cys(Bzl)-Pro-Orn(Tos)-Gly-NH2(5), Des-amino-Cys(Bzl)-D-Tyr(4-OEt)-IIe-Thr-OH (6), Des-amino-Cys(Bzl)-D-<br><br><br>

According to the present invention, Atosiban is prepared by one or more of the processes described in strategies I, IA and II. The strategy in these processes is mainly to avoid the use of costly D-tyrosine in multiple steps. This is why the initial coupling of amino acids begins from Glycinamide side and subsequently, other amino acids are attached with Glycinamide with protected ornithine and proline and the like. Thus, one-by-one protected pentapeptide, for example Boc-Asn-Cys(Bzl)-Pro-Om(Tos)-Gly-NH2 (4) orBoc-Asn-Cys(Tr)-Pro-Orn(Tos)-Gly-NH2 (18) is synthesized.<br>
Conceptually, one can synthesize peptides by employing a variety of protecting groups for nitrogen, thiol, and C-terminus which are mentioned in the literature ("M. Bodanszky, Principles of peptide synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin heidelberg, 1993, 2nd edition" and "Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, Protective groups in organic synthesis, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1998, 3rd edition") using activating groups for coupling and subsequent deprotection. More specifically, protecting groups such as Cbz(carbonylbenzyloxy), Boc(tert-butoxy carbonyl), Fmoc (9-fluorenyl methoxy carbonyl) and the like are used for nitrogen; benzyl, tert-butyl, trityl, acetamidomethyl and the like are used for thiol and ter-butyl ester, benzyl ester, phenacyl ester, ethyl ester, 4-nitrophenyl ester and the like are used for C-terminus (see Table 1). But person skilled in the art can also replace these protecting groups with other protecting groups and similar objectives may be achieved.<br>
The scope of the present invention should be construed as encompassing such obvious alterations or extrapolations.<br>
Similarly, above mentioned pentapeptide has also been prepared by altering the sequence of addition of amino acid and ultimately achieving the same objective. The protection of amines of amino acids with Boc or FmoC, Cbz, benzyl and the like was accomplished by reacting the corresponding amino acid with either Boc-anhydride or Fmoc-formyl or corresponding chlorides such as Fmoc chloride, Cbz chloride, benzyl chloride in a suitable solvent and in the presence of a suitable base. The reaction was carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 °C to 100 °C. Some of the suitable solvents commonly employed may be acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol, water, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ether, ethyl acetate and the like or mixtures thereof. The organic and inorganic bases commonly used may be triethyl amine, pyridine, diethyl isopropyl amine,<br><br><br>
sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like or mixtures thereof. Other specialized nitrogen protecting groups for bifunctional amino acids such as L-tyrosin, L-ornithine may be chosen from either above mentioned protecting groups or orthogonally protected groups such as tosylate, mesylate, besylate and the like. The chemoselective protection of the side chain amino group in L-ornithine is carried out by intramolecular in situ protection using cupric carbonate in water and subsequent treatment with tosyl chloride, mesyl chloride or besyl chloride in the presence of either organic or inorganic bases as mentioned above.<br>
Similarly, the coupling of two protected amino acids, one protected at N-terminus and other protected at C-terminus, is accomplished by using commonly used coupling agents such as DCCI (1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), CDI (Carbonyldiimidazole), Bop-Cl(bis-2-(oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride or by formation of mixed anhydride with pivaloyl chloride or isobutyl chloroformate or DPC (2,2'-dipyridyl carbonate) (see table 2 &amp; 3). Water soluble derivatives such as l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) may be used for clearer reactions and operational simplicity. During such couplings, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) may be used to avoid side reactions, catalyse the reaction and prevent racemization. While coupling two amino acids, it becomes essential that the amino group of one amino acid and carboxyl group of the other amino acid is protected. Protection of carboxylic acid is carried out as methyl, benzyl or ethyl esters. Such esters may be prepared from corresponding carboxylic acids and alcohols by using either thionyl chloride or dry HC1 gas. Alternatively, after the coupling, the carboxylate esters may be hydrolysed by aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The deprotection of amino protecting agents (PG-1/ PG-2, table 1) may be carried out either in the presence of acid mainly TFA or by catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with sodium in liquid ammonia, but keeping the sensitivity of other protecting groups in mind. Similarly, the deprotection of either Acm or Trityl for thiol may be carried out under acidic conditions.<br>
Once again, similar to N-terminus protecting groups, a wide variety of protecting groups for C-terminus are reported in the literature and a person skilled in the art may alter them advantageously to obtain the desired results. The scope of present invention should not be limited to deny the inventors protection to such obvious alterations.<br>
Followings are the examples of various protecting groups, coupling reagents and mixed anhydrides used in the specification: <br>

The key features of the current process for Atosiban are the coupling strategies of different amino acid fragments, such as 1+3+5 (4+5) and 1+8 as depicted in strategies I, IA and II respectively. Additionally, trityl group has been used for S-H protection of Cysteine as shown in 1J$ (strategy IA). Naturally, the synthesis of nonapeptide starting from Glycinaminde is accomplished through pentapeptide as discussed, but other obvious permutations and combinations are also possible by those skilled in the art and are incorporated herein with the scope of this invention.<br>

In terms of peptide synthetic methodology, two major synthetic techniques dominate current practice. These are synthesis in solution and synthesis on solid phase. Majority of synthetic strategies reported for Atosiban are in solid phase. Although biotech methods using recombinant DNA are also useful for peptide synthesis, but their applicability has limitations with unnatural D-amino acids. In Atosiban, one of the amino acid has D-configuration.<br><br><br>
ZRC-NPR-010<br>
Vasotocin derivatives are firstly reported by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Sweden in its<br>
US 4504469 which is incorporated as reference in its entirity. The synthetic strategy<br>
reported here is in solid state. US 5373089 discloses oxytocin antagonist.<br>
There are several draw backs associated with solid phase synthetic strategies reported<br>
in these prior arts for the synthesis of Atosiban e.g. difficult to synthesize on a large<br>
scale leading to lots of waste. Further in such a synthetic strategy, the isolation of<br>
intermediate compounds is not possible. Therefore, it is not possible to detect side<br>
reactions including incomplete deprotection and coupling reaction.<br>
In solution phase synthesis, the intermediate compounds can be isolated and<br>
characterised at every step which provides convenience in detection of side reaction<br>
including incomplete deprotection and     coupling reaction.  The unwanted  side<br>
products can then be removed before proceeding any further.<br>
Further this approach has the advantage of allowing chemist to know exactly which<br>
chemical species they are dealing with at any stage of the process.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention Atosiban may be prepared by on or more of the processes described in schemes I-IV. The strategy in these processes is mainly to avoid the use of costly D-tyrosine in multiple steps. This is why the initial coupling of amino acids begins from Glycinamide side and subsequently, other amino acids are attached with Glycinamide with protected ornithine and proline and the like. Thus, one-by-one protected penta peptide, for example PG-l-Asn-Cys-S-(PG-3)L-Pro-Orn-(PG-2)-Gly-NH2 is synthesized. Conceptually, one can synthesize peptides by employing a variety of protecting groups for nitrogen, thiol, and C-terminus which are mentioned in the literature ("M. Bodanszky, Principles of peptide synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin heidelberg, 1993, 2nd edition" and "Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, Protective groups in organic synthesis, Wiley-Interscience, New York,<br><br><br>
ZRC-NPR-010<br>
1998, 3 edition") using activating groups for coupling and subsequent deprotection. More specifically, protecting groups such as Cbz(carbonylbenzyloxy), Boc(tert-butoxy carbonyl), Fmoc (9-fluorenyl methoxy carbonyl) and the like is used for nitrogen; Benzyl, tert-butyl, Trityl, Acetamidomethyl and the like is used for thiol and Tert-Butyl ester, Benzyl ester, Phenacyl ester, Ethyl ester, 4-Nitrophenyl ester and the like is used for C-terminus(see Table 1). But person skilled in the art can also change to other protecting groups and similar objectives can be achieved. The scope of the present invention should not be limited in such obvious alterations or extrapolations. Similarly, above mentioned penta peptide can also be prepared by altering the sequence of addition of amino acid and ultimately achieving the same objective. The protection of amines of amino acids with Boc or FmoC, Cbz, benzyl and the like is accomplished by reacting corresponding amino acid with either Boc-anhydride or corresponding chlorides such as Fmoc chloride, cbz chloride, benzyl chloride in a polar solvent and in the presence of a suitable base. The reaction is carried out at a temprature in the range from 0 °C to 100 °C. Some of the polar solvents commonly employed are acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol, water, dioxane, tetrahydrofiiran, ether, ethyl acetate and the like or mixture thereof. The organic and inorganic bases commonly used are triethyl amine, pyridine, diethyl isopropyl amine, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like or mixture thereof. Other specialized nitrogen protecting groups for bifunctional amino acids such as L-tyrosin, L-ornithine can be chosen from either above mentioned protecting groups or diagonally protected groups such as tosylate, mesylate, besylate and the like. The chemoselective protection of side chain amino group in L-ornithine is carried out by intramolecular in situ protection by copper using cupric carbonate in water and subsequent treatment with tosyl chloride, mesyl chloride or besyl chloride in the presence of either organic or inorganic bases mentioned above.<br>
Similarly, the coupling of two protected amino acids, one protected at N-terminus and other protected at C-terminus is accomplished by using commonly used coupling agents such as DCC (1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), CDI (Carbonyldiimidazole), Bop-Cl(bis-2-(oxo-3-oxazolidinyl) phosphinic chloride or by formation of mixed anhydride with pivaloyl chloride or isobutyl chloformate or DPC (2,2'-dipyridyl<br><br><br>
ZRC-NPR-010<br>
carbonate)(see table 2 &amp; 3). Usually, water soluble derivatives such as l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylamino propyl) carbodiimide (EDO) is also used for clearer rections and operational simplicity. During such couplings 1-hydroxybenzo triazole (HOBt) is used to avoid side reactions, catalyse the reaction and prevent racemization. While coupling two amino acids, it becomes essential that the amino group of one amino acid and carboxyl group of the amino acid is protected. Usually, protection of carboxylic acid are carried out as methyl, benzyl or ethyl esters. Such esters are prepared from corresponding carboxylic acids and alcohols by using either thionyl chloride or dry HC1 gas. Alternatively, after the coupling, the carboxylate esters are hydrolysed by aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The deprotection of amino protecting agents (PG-1/ PG-2, table 1) is also carried out either in the presence of acid or by catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with lithium in liquid ammonia, but keeping the sensitivity of other protecting groups in mind. Once again, similar to N-terminus protecting groups, wide variety of protecting groups for C-terminus are reported in the literature and a person skilled in the art can alter them advantageously, as reported in the literature. The scope Of present invention should not be limited due to such obvious alterations.<br>

Followings schemes depicts the novel process for the preparation Atosiban:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The key features of current process for Atosiban are the coupling strategies of different amino acid fragments, such as 1+3+5 (4+5), 2+2+5(4+5), 2+7 and 1+8 as depicted in schemes 1 to 4 respectively. Naturally, the synthesis of octapeptide starting from Glycinaminde is accomplished through penta peptide as discussed, but other obvious permutation and combinations are also possible by those skilled in the art and are incorporated herein with the scope of this invention.<br>
