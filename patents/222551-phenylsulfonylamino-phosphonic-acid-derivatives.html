The invention relates to novel sulfonylamino -phosphonic acid derivatives, to processes tor their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.<br>
The applications EP 0 606 046, WO 95/35276 and WO 96/27583 describe arylsulfonaminohydroxamic acids and their action as matrix metallo-proteinase inhibitors. Specific aryisulfonaminocarboxylic acids are used as intermediates for preparing thrombin inhibitors (EP 0 468 231) and aldose reductase inhibitors (EP 0 305 947). The application EP 0 757 037 also describes the action of sulfonylaminocarboxylic acid derivatives as metallo-proteinase inhibitors. The arylsulfonyl group has furthermore proved to be an effective protective group of the amino function of a-aminocarboxylic acids (R. Roemmele, H. Rapoport, J, Org. Chem. 53 (1988) 2367-2371). In the attempt to find efficacious compounds for the treatment of connective tissue disorders, it has now been found that the sulfonylaminophosphinic and -phosphonic acid derivatives according to the invention are strong inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Particular value is placed here on the inhibition of stromelysin (matrix metalloproteinase 3), of neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and of aggrecanase, since these enzymes are involved to a considerable extent in the degradation of proteoglycans, as important constituents of the cartilaginous tissue (A.J. Fosang et al. J. Clin, invest. 98 (1996) 2292-2299).<br>
The pathological loss of aggrecan, the main proteoglycan of the cartilage, includes proteolytic cleavages in its interglobular domain. Amino acid sequence analyses of proteoglycan metabolites, isolated from the synovial fluid of patients who are suffering from injury to a joint, from osteoarthrosis or from an inflammatory joint condition, showed that a proteolytic cleavage preferably takes place between the amino acids Glu and Ala in the interglobular domain of human aggrecan (Lohmander et al. Arthritis Rheum. 36, (1993), 1214-1222). Until now, it was not yet possible to iden¬tify the proteolytic activity which is responsible for this cleavage. It is desig¬nated as "aggrecanase" and can be, included in the metalloproteinase family.<br><br>
The detection of the expression of MT1-MMP in human cartilaginous tissue for the first time (Buttner et al. Arthritis Rheum. 40, 1997, 704-709), combined with the proof that the catalytic domain of this enzyme cleaves at the "aggrecanase" cleavage site in the recombinant aggrecan fusion protein rAgg1mut (Buttner et al. Biochem. J. 333, 1998, 159-165), led to the testing of the strong matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors described here with respect to their action against an "aggrecanase" activity. It was possible here to show, using various assay systems, that the sulfonylaminophos-phinic and -phosphonic acid derivatives are also strong inhibitors for the "aggrecanase" activity.<br>
The invention therefore relates to the compound of the formula I<br><br><br>

The expression "R  and R  together with the ring amino group form a 4- to 7-membered ring and/or one of the carbon atoms is replaced by -0-, -S- or -NH-" is understood as meaning radicals which are derived, for example, from azetidine, pyrrole, pyrroline, pyridine, azepine, piperidine, oxazole, isoxazole, imidazole, indoline, pyrazole, thiazole, isothiazole, diazepine, thiomorpholine, pyrimidine or pyrazine. The term "halogen" is understood as meaning fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The term "alkyl" or "alkenyl" is understood as meaning hydrocarbon radicals whose hydro¬carbon chains are straight-chain or branched. Cyclic alkyl radicals are, for example, 3- to 6-membered monocyclic systems such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. The alkenyl radicals can furthermore also contain a number of double bonds. The general structural formula of a-amino acids is as follows:<br><br>
The a-amino acids differ from one another by the radical R, which in the context of the present application is designated as a "characteristic radical" of an amino acid.<br>
The starting substances for the chemical reactions are known or can be easily prepared by methods known from the literature. The amino-phosphinic and -phosphonic acids used as starting substances for the synthesis of the compounds according to the invention are, if not commercially obtainable in the individual case, synthesizable according to known methods (R. S. Rogers, M. K. Stern, Synlett 1992, 708; P. P. Giannousis, P. A. Bartlett, J. Med. Chem. 30, 1603 (1987); J. P. Genet, M. Uziel, A. M. Touzin, S. Roland, S. Thorimbert, S. Tanier, Tetrahedron Lett. 33, 77 (1992); E. K. Baylis, C. D. Campbell, J. G. Dingwall, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1,1984,2845).<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for preparing the compound of the formula I and/or a stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt of the compound of the formula I, which comprises a)       reacting an aminophosphinic or -phosphonic acid of the formula III<br><br><br>

and then converting the compound of the formula IX, with removal of the protective group E and of the radical R with the aid of suitable cleavage reagents, into the compound of the formula I, or<br>
d)	separating a compound of the formula I prepared by one of<br>
the processes a), b) or c), which on account of its chemical<br>
structure occurs in enantiomeric forms, into the pure enantio-<br>

bases, chromatography on chiral stationary phases or<br>
derivatization by means of chiral enantiomerically pure<br>
compounds such as amino acids, separation of the diastereo-<br>
mers thus obtained, and removal of the chiral auxiliary<br>
groups, or<br>
e)	isolating the compound of the formula I prepared by one of<br>
the processes a), b), c) or d) either in free form or, in the case<br>
of the presence of acidic or basic groups, converting it into<br>
physiologically tolerable salts.<br>
Suitable protective groups E used for this are preferably the N-protective groups customary in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the urethane type, benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Aloe) or of the acid amide type, in particular formyl, acetyl or trifluoroacetyl, and of the alkyl type, for example benzyl.<br><br>
Compounds of the formula III employed, in which R   is a hydrogen atom and R   is the characteristic radical of an amino acid, are preferably the characteristic radicals of the following naturally occurring a-amino acids: i    glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, trypto¬phan,  serine,  threonine,  cysteine,  methionine,  asparagine,  glutamine, lysine, histidine, arginine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Compounds of the formula III employed, in which R   is a hydrogen atom and R3 is the characteristic radical of an amino acid, are preferably the characteristic radicals, for example, of the following non-naturally occurring amino acids: 2-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, 2-amino-isobutyric acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, 2-amino-pimelic acid, phenylglycine, 3-(2-thienyl)alanine, 3-(3-thienyl)alanine, 2-(2-thienyl)glycine,   2-aminoheptanoic   acid,   pipecolic   acid,   hydroxyzine, sarcosine, N-methylisoleucine, 6-N-methyllysine, N-methylvaline, norvaline, norleucine,   ornithine,    alloisoleucine,    allothreonine,   4-hydroxyproline, 3-hydroxyproline, allohydroxylysine, 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, 3-(1-naphthyl-alanine),  homophenylalanine,  homocysteine,  homocysteic acid,  homo-tryptophan,  cysteic acid, 3-(2-pyridyl)alanine,  3-(3-pyridyl)alanine,  3-(4-pyridyl)alanine, citrulline, phosphinothricin, 4-fluorophenylalanine, 3-fluoro-phenylalanine, 2-fluorophenylalanine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, 4-nitrophenyl-alanine,   4-aminophenylalanine,    cyclohexylalanine,    5-fluorotryptophan, 5-methoxytryptophan, methionine sulfone, methionine sulfoxide or NH2-NH-CONH2, if appropriate substituted. In the case of naturally but also of non-naturally occurring amino acids which have a functional group such as<br>
amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, mercapto, guanidyl, imidazolyl or indolyl in the<br>
3 side chain R , this group can also be protected.<br>
3 If there is an imidazole radical in R , the sulfonic acid derivative of the<br>
formula IV employed for the sulfonamide formation, for example, serves as<br>
a protective group for the imidazole nitrogen, which can be removed again,<br>
in particular in the presence of bases such as aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution.<br>
2	3<br>
To prepare compounds of the formula I in which R and R together form a ring of the substructure II, the starting substances of the formula III utilized are, for example, 2-methylpropylphosphonic acid, piperidine-2-phosphonic acid, piperazine-2-phosphonic acidor hexahydropyridazine-3-<br><br>
phosphonic acid, it being possible, in particular, for the nitrogen in the 4-position of the piperazine-2-phosphonic acid to be substituted by a protective group Z, for example benzyloxycarbonyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl as described in process variant c) or by a radical R7.<br><br>
g where R  is a radical described under 2.1. to 2.15.<br>
For the preparation of the arylsulfonic acids of the formulae Xa and b, the sulfonation process using concentrated sulfuric acid described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Organischen Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry] Volume 9, pp. 450-546 is preferably used, if appropriate in the presence of a catalyst, sulfur trioxide and its addition compounds or halosulfonic acids, such as chlorosulfonic acid. Particularly in the case of the diphenyl ethers of the formula Xb, the use of concentrated sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride as a solvent (cf. CM. Suter, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 53 (1931) 1114), or the reaction with excess chlorosulfonic acid (J.P. Bassin, R. Cremlyn and F. Swinbourne; Phosphorus, Sulfur and Silicon 72 (1992) 157) has proven suitable. Sulfonic acids according to the formula Xc, Xd or Xe can be prepared in a manner known per se by reacting the corresponding arylalkyl halide with sulfites such as sodium sulfite or ammonium sulfite in aqueous or aqueous/alcoholic solution, it being possible to accelerate the<br><br>
reaction in the presence of tetraorganoammonium salts such as tetrabutylammonium chloride.<br>
Sulfonic acid derivatives according to formula IV used are, in particular, the sulfonyl chlorides. For their preparation, the corresponding sulfonic acids, also in the form of their salts, such as sodium, ammonium or pyridinium salts, are reacted in a known manner with phosphorus pentachloride or thionyl chloride without or in the presence of a solvent such as phosphorus oxytrichloride or of an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, cyclohexane or chloroform, in general at reaction temperatures from 20°C up to the boiling point of the reaction medium used.<br>
The reaction of the sulfonic acid derivatives of the formula IV with the aminophosphonic acids of the formulae III, V or VII according to process variants a), b) or c) proceeds advantageously in the manner of the Schotten-Baumann reaction. Suitable bases for this are particularly alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, but also alkali metal acetates, hydrogencarbonates, carbonates and amines. The reaction takes place in water and/or in a water-miscible or immiscible solvent such as tetra-hydrofuran (THF), acetone, dioxane or acetonitrile, the reaction in general being kept at from -10°C to 50°C. If the reaction is carried out in an anhydrous medium, tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride, acetonitrile or dioxane in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, N-methyl-morpholine, N-ethyl- or diisopropylethylamine, is especially used, possibly in the presence of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst.<br>
In another variant, the aminocarboxylic acids of the formula III, IV or VII can first be converted into their silylated form with the aid of a silylating agent such as bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and they can then be reacted with sulfonic acid derivatives to give the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The preparation of physiologically acceptable salts from compounds of the formula I capable of salt formation, including their stereoisomeric forms, is carried out in a manner known per se. The phosphonic or phosphinic acids form stable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium salts with basic reagents such as hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, alkoxides and also ammonia or organic bases, for<br><br>
example trimethyl- or triethylamine, ethanolamine or triethanolamine or alternatively basic amino acids, for example lysine, ornithine or arginine. If the compounds of the formula I have basic groups, stable acid addition salts can also be prepared using strong acids. Both inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, methane-sulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, 4-bromobenzenesulfonic, cyclohexylamidosulfonic, trifluoromethylsulfonic, acetic, oxalic, tartaric, succinic or trifluoroacetic acid are suitable for this.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals comprising an efficacious amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physio¬logically acceptable salt of the compound of the formula I and/or an optionally stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I, together with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically acceptable excipient, additive and/or other active compounds and auxiliaries.<br>
On account of the pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the prophylaxis and therapy of all those disorders in the course of which an increased activity of matrix-degrading enzymes such as metalloproteinases or aggrecanase is involved. These include degenerative joint disorders such as osteoarthroses, spondyloses, chondrolysis after joint trauma or relatively long joint immobilization after meniscus or patella injuries or torn ligaments. These furthermore also include disorders of the connective tissue such as collagenoses, periodontal disorders, wound healing disorders and chronic disorders of the locomotory apparatus such as inflammatory, immunologically or metaboli-cally related acute and chronic arthritis, arthropathies, myalgias and disorders of the bone metabolism. The compounds of the formula I are furthermore suitable for the treatment of ulceration, atherosclerosis and stenoses. The compounds of the formula I are furthermore suitable for the treatment of inflammations, carcinomatous disorders, tumor metastasis formation, cachexia, anorexia and septic shock.<br>
In general, the pharmaceuticals according to the invention are administered orally or parenterally. Rectal or transdermal administration is also possible.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the production of a pharmaceutical, which comprises bringing at least one compound of the formula I into a suitable administration form using a pharmaceutically<br><br>
suitable and physiologically acceptable excipient and, if appropriate, further suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable solid or pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders, coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions and preparations with protracted release of active compound in the production of which customary auxiliaries such as excipients, disintegrants, binding agents, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are used. Frequently used auxiliaries which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, lactoprotein, gelatin, starch, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils such as cod liver oil, sunflower, groundnut or sesame oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents such as, for example, sterile water and mono- or polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably prepared and administered in dose units, each unit containing as active constituent a specific dose of the compound of the formula I according to the invention. In the case of solid dose units such as tablets, capsules, coated tablets or suppositories, this dose can be up to approximately 1000 mg, but preferably approxi¬mately 50 to 300 mg, and in the case of injection solutions in ampoule form up to approximately 300 mg, but preferably approximately 10 to 100 mg.<br>
For the treatment of an adult patient weighing approximately 70 kg, depending on the efficacy of the compound according to formula I, daily doses of approximately 20 mg to 1000 mg of active compound, preferably, for example, 100 mg to 500 mg, are indicated. Under certain circum¬stances, however, higher or lower daily doses may also be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else of a number of smaller dose units and by multiple administration of subdivided doses at specific intervals.<br>

Pharmacological examples<br>
Preparation and determination of the enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain of human stromelysin and of neutrophil collagenase.<br>
The two enzymes - stromelysin (MMP-3) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) - were prepared according to Ye et al. (Biochemistry; 31 (1992) pages 11231-11235). For the measurement of the enzyme activity or of the enzyme inhibitor action, 70 JJ\ of buffer solution and 10 //I of enzyme solution are incubated for 15 minutes with 10 fj\ of a 10% strength (v/v) aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide solution which optionally contains the enzyme inhibitor. After addition of 10 //I of a 10% strength (v/v) aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide solution which contains 1 mmol/l of the substrate, the enzyme reaction is monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (328 nm (ex)/-393 nm(em)).<br><br>
The enzyme activity is shown as extinction increase/minute. The IC50<br>
values listed in Table 2 are determined as those inhibitor concentrations<br>
which in each case lead to a 50% inhibition of the enzyme.<br>
The buffer solution contains 0.05% Brij (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany)<br>
and 0.1 mol/l of tris/HCI, 0.1 mol/l of NaCI, 0.01 mol/l of CaC^ and 0.1 mol/l<br>
of piperazine-N,N'-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (pH=6.5).<br>
The enzyme solution contains 5 yt/g/ml of one of the enzyme domains<br>
prepared according to Ye et al. The substrate solution contains 1 mmol/l of<br>
the fluorogenic substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-l_eu-<br>
3-(2',4,-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl-Ala-Arg-NH2	(Bachem,<br>

Preparation and determination of the enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain of aggrecanase using rat chondrosarcoma cells For the generation of the as yet not identified "aggrecanase" activity, rat chondrosarcoma cells (RCS) were used (Lark et al.; J. Biol. Chem., 270; (1995), 2550-2556). These cells were inoculated into 96-well cell culture plates precoated with poly-L-lysine (80,000 cells/well). After stimulation of the RCS cells with retinoic acid (0.67 //M) and an incubation time of 47 hours (h) at 37°C and 5% CO2, these cells generate the "aggrecanase" activity. The test substance compound 1 was then preincubated for 1 h in<br><br>
the "aggrecanase"-containing cell culture supernatant before 5//g of eucaryotic rAgg1mut (Buttner et al., Biochem. J. 333; (1998), 159-165 and Hughes et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272; (1997), 20269-20274) were added for the detection of the "aggrecanase" cleavage activity in the cell culture supernatant of the RCS cells. After an incubation time of 4 h, the cell culture supernatant was removed and the cleavage products of the rAgglmut fusion proteins generated by the "aggrecanase" activity were detected by means of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western Blot analyses with the monoclonal antibody BC-3 (Hughes et al. Biochem. J. 305, 799-804, 1995). The action of the compound 1 was seen in the lowering of the BC-3 reactive cleavage products. The less cleaved rAgglmut was detected, the more efficacious was the tested compound of the formula I.<br>
The IC50 values listed in Table 3 are determined as those inhibitor concentrations which in each case led to a 50% inhibition of the enzyme aggrecanase.<br><br><br><br><br>
