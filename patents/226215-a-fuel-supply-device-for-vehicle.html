[Title of the Invention] FUEL SUPPLY DEVICE FOR VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel supply device for a vehicle, and more particularly to a fuel supply device for a vehicle which is suitably arranged in the inside of a fuel tank which is small and has a small width. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
There has been proposed a constitution in which a fuel supply device which is constituted of a fuel pump body, a pressure regulating valve (regulator), a check valve and the like is mounted in the inside of a fuel tank. For example, in JP-A-11-294245, there is disclosed a fuel supply device which is arranged in the inside of a fuel tank and is formed of the integral structure constituted of a cylindrical fuel pump, a fuel filter arranged in a periphery of the fuel pump, a regulator and a check valve which are arranged above the fuel pump and outside an extending line of an outer diameter of the fuel pump, and a container which houses these parts. [0003]<br>
Further, in JP-A-2001-3826, there is disclosed a pump module which incorporates a fuel pump assembly and a jet pump into a reservoir arranged in the inside of a fuel tank.<br>
[Patent literature 1] JP-A-11-294285<br>
[Patent literature 2] JP-A-2001-3826 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve] [0004]<br>
In the fuel supply device disclosed in the patent literature 1, the regulator, the check valve and the like project from the outer periphery of the fuel pump and the fuel supply device as a whole has a large width. Further, the pump module disclosed in the patent literature 2 is also additionally provided with the jet pump in a state that the jet pump projects from an outer periphery of the fuel pump and hence, the pump module has a large width. Accordingly, the reservoir container which houses the fuel pump assembly and the jet pump is also has a large width. [0005]<br>
In this manner, in an attempt to house the fuel supply device having a large width or the reservoir container including the fuel pump having a large width into the inside of the fuel tank, a shape of the fuel tank becomes naturally large in width or the fuel supply device or the reservoir container can be housed only in the fuel tank having the large capacitance. However, with respect to a motorcycle of an offroad model or a racing model, the fuel tank has the small capacitance or has a complicated shape and hence, it is<br>
difficult to house the fuel supply device or the pump module of the conventional device having a large width shape as a whole in the inside of the fuel tank. [0006]<br>
Accordingly, there has been a demand for a fuel supply device which can be easily mounted in the inside of a fuel tank of a motorcycle of an offroad model or a racing model. [0007]<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a fuel supply device of a vehicle which constitutes an assembled body such that the fuel supply device can be easily mounted in the inside of a fuel tank which may have a complicated inner shape or may have a small capacitance. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0008]<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, the first object of the invention lies in that, in a fuel supply device for a vehicle having at least a plurality of parts including a motor pump and a housing which houses the parts, [0009]<br>
the housing has a cylindrical shape, and the plurality of parts are arranged in the inside of the housing such that a cylindrical diameter of the housing which encases the part having the largest profile among the plurality of parts is minimized.<br>
[0010]<br>
Further, the second feature of the invention lies in that a fuel supply device for a vehicle includes a motor pump and a pressure regulating valve and a check valve provided to a discharge passage of the pump, and a housing which houses the motor pump, the pressure regulating valve and the check valve, wherein the housing has a diameter which circumscribes a cylindrical profile of the motor pump, and the pressure regulating valve and the check valve are arranged in the inside of the diameter. [0011]<br>
Further, the third feature of the invention lies in that a fuel supply device for a vehicle includes a motor pump and a check valve provided to a discharge passage of the pump, and a housing which houses the motor pump and the check valve, wherein the housing has a diameter which circumscribes a cylindrical profile of the motor pump, and the check valve is arranged in the inside of the diameter. [0012]<br>
The fourth feature of the invention lies in that a mounting surface is formed on a discharge-passage-side end surface of the cylindrical housing. [Advantage of the Invention] [0013]<br>
According to the invention having the first to third<br>
features, the cylindrical housing having the minimum diameter which includes the part having the largest profile out of the parts which constitute the fuel supply device is set, and the plurality of other constitutional parts including the motor pump are arranged in the inside of the housing and hence, it is possible to form the whole fuel supply device into an elongated shape. Accordingly, it is possible to easily arrange the fuel supply device even in the inside of the fuel tank having a small width such as an offroad model. [0014]<br>
Particularly, according to the fourth feature, since the mounting surface is formed on the end surface of the housing and hence, it is possible to reduce the mounting area whereby it is possible to easily mount the fuel supply device even on an upper surface of the fuel tank having a small width or the like.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0015]<br>
One embodiment of the invention is explained hereinafter in conjunction with drawings.<br>
[Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>
[0035]<br>

[Fig. 6]   A cross-sectional view of a fuel pump according<br>
to a further modification.<br>
[Fig. 7]   A top plan view of the fuel pump shown in Fig. 6.<br>
       Fig. 4 is a side view of a<br>
motorcycle of an offroad model having a fuel supply device according to one embodiment of the invention. In the drawing, the motorcycle 1 is provided with a vehicle body frame which includes a head pipe 10 which is positioned at a front portion of a vehicle body, main frames 11 which extend rearwardly and<br>
downwardly from the head pipe 10, and a lower frame 12 which has a front end thereof connected to lower ends of the main frames 11 and extends rearwardly. A rear portion of the lower frame 12 is further raised to form a rear frame 13. [0016]<br>
A handle 2 is mounted on an upper portion of the head pipe 10. A front wheel 3 is supported on a front fork 14 which extends downwardly from the head pipe 10. An engine 4 is mounted between the main frames 11 and the lower frame 12. An intake pipe 5 and an exhaust pipe 6 are connected to the engine 4, while the exhaust pipe 6 is connected to a muffler 7 which is arranged at a rear portion of the vehicle body. A rear wheel 16 is supported on a stay 15 which extends rearwardly from the vehicle body frame. Power is transmitted to the rear wheel 16 from the engine 4 by way of a transmission 17 and a clutch. [0017]<br>
Although front portions of the above-mentioned main frames 11 are connected to the head pipe 10, rear portions of the main frames 11 are bifurcated in the vehicle width direction. Further, a fuel tank 18 is provided in a state that the fuel tank 18 is positioned between the main frames 11 and above the engine 4. A rider's seat 19 which extends rearwardly in a state that the rider's seat 19 covers a portion of a rear portion of the fuel tank 18 is supported on the rear frame 13 in a lying state. The seat 19 includes a hinge and a lock not shown in<br><br>
the drawing, wherein, the seat 19 is opened upwardly about the hinge by unlocking the lock and hence, the rider can get access to an upper portion of a fuel supply device 20 (see Fig. 2). [0018]<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of the fuel supply device mounted in the inside of the fuel tank, Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of an essential part of the above-mentioned motorcycle, and Fig. 3 is a top plan view of the fuel supply device. In Fig. 2, an upper surface 181 of the fuel tank 18 is formed into a flat surface and the fuel supply device 20 is fixed to the flat upper surface 181 by way of a base plate 41. The fuel supply device 20 has a whole shape thereof constituted in an elongated shape and extends toward a bottom portion of a fuel tank 18. [0019]<br>
In Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, on the upper surface 181 of the fuel tank 18, an annular plate 182 for mounting the fuel supply device 20 is mounted by integral molding (by casting or the like) with the fuel tank 18. An outer periphery of the plate 182 is fitted into a dovetail groove 183 which is an opening formed in the upper surface 181 of the fuel tank 18. The fuel supply device 20 is fixed by fastening the base plate 41 positioned above the fuel supply device 20 to the plate 182 using a plurality of bolts 45. [0020]<br>
From the upper portion of the fuel supply device 20, a hose joint 43 which is connected with a fuel hose 21 for supplying fuel discharged from the fuel pump 24 to a fuel injection valve 49 (Fig. 2), a connector 48 which leads an electric line for the fuel pump 24 and the like are projected. These parts are covered with a seat 19. [0021]<br>
The fuel supply device 20 includes a cylindrical housing 25 and a cap 26, wherein a pressure regulating valve 32 and a check valve 38 are arranged in the housing 25 in a state that the pressure regulating valve 32 and the check valve 38 do not project from an outer diameter of the fuel pump 24. The fuel supply device 20 is elongated as a whole. In this embodiment, since such an elongated fuel supply device 20 is arranged vertically and is mounted on the fuel tank 18, it is possible to make a mounting surface with respect to the fuel tank 18 small. Accordingly, the fuel supply device 20 is suitable for a vehicle such as an offroad model motor cycle which includes the fuel tank 18 having a small vehicle-width directional size. [0022]<br>
To a bottom portion of the fuel supply device 20, an intake pipe 23 for fuel having a filter 22 is connected. As shown in Fig. 2, a fuel hose 21 which is pulled out to the outside from the upper portion of the fuel supply device 20 is connected to a fuel injection valve 49 mounted on the intake pipe 5 of<br>
the engine 4. [0023]<br>
A bottom surface of the fuel tank 18 projects downwardly and forms a recessed portion 184 which is suitable for the accumulation of fuel as viewed from an inner surface thereof. The fuel supply device 20 is arranged such that the filter 22<br>
is positioned in the inside of the recessed portion 184.1<br>
 Accordingly, even when the fuel in the inside of the fuel tank<br>
18 becomes small, the fuel tank 18 can suck the fuel accumulated in the recessed portion 184. That is, the fuel tank is configured such that even when the motorcycle for racing or the like has such a complicated tank shape and the remaining fuel becomes small, the motorcycle can continue the traveling as long as possible. [0024]<br>
In this embodiment, since the fuel supply device 20 is configured to be mounted on the upper surface of the fuel tank 18, it is possible to preferably use the fuel tank 18 having such a complicated bottom-surface shape. [0025]<br>
A motor pump which constitutes a body of the fuel supply device 20, that is, the fuel pump 24 is housed in a space defined by a cylindrical housing 25 and a cap 26. The fuel pump 24 is a Wasco type pump which includes an impeller (not shown in the drawing) in a lower portion, that is, at a position close<br>
to a bottom portion of the fuel tank 18. The cap 26 is fitted on an outer periphery of the housing 25 and the cap 26 and the housing 25 are connected with each other due to the engagement between pawl members 27 formed on the housing 25 side and holes 28 formed in the cap 26 side. The cap 26 includes a wall 31 which forms a discharge passage 30 which is, in turn, fitted on a fuel outlet 29 which is mounted on an upper portion of the motor 24 in a projecting manner. An annular wall 33 is formed on a middle portion of the wall 31 for holding a pressure regulating valve 32. The pressure regulating valve 32 includes a spherical valve element 35 which is supported on a diaphragm, wherein the valve element 35 closes a hole communicated with the discharge passage 30 at a given pressure. When the fuel pressure in the inside of the discharge passage 30 exceeds the given pressure, the spherical valve element 35 is retracted and hence, the fuel is leaked into the inside of the pressure regulating valve 32 whereby the pressure in the inside of the discharge passage 30 is maintained at the given value. The leaked fuel is made to return to the fuel pump 24 through a return passage 37 which is formed in the fuel pump 24. [0026]<br>
A check valve 38 is mounted on an upper portion of the discharge passage 30. The check valve 38 is biased downwardly by a spring 39. Accordingly, when the fuel attempts to flow<br>
backwardly, that is, when the fuel attempts to flow into the fuel supply device 20} a valve element 40 closes the discharge passage 30 so as to prevent the backflow. [0027]<br>
A hose joint 43 which is formed on the base plate 41 includes a passage 42 which is communicated with the discharge passage 30. A lower surface of the base plate 41 and an upper surface of the cap 26 are connected with each other by adhesion, melting or the like. Further/ an electric line 46 which extends from a connector 48 for an electric line which is formed on the base plate 41 is connected to the fuel pump 24. [0028]<br>
The base plate 41 includes a skirt 411 which extends downwardly and a gap formed between an outer periphery of the skirt 411 and an inner periphery of a plate 182 which is fitted in an opening formed in the upper surface of the fuel tank 18 is liquid-hermetically sealed by a sealing member 44. [0029]<br>
In this manner, since the pressure regulating valve 32 and the check valve 38 are arranged in a state that these parts are accommodated in the inside of a cylinder which is extended along the outer diameter of the fuel pump 24, it is possible to reduce the size of the base plate 41 (that is, the planar area can be reduced). Accordingly, it is possible to mount the base plate 41 on the upper surface of the fuel tank 18 which<br>
is narrow in the vehicle-width direction without any trouble. [0030]<br>
With respect to the above-explained fuel supply device 20, the filter 22 is mounted on the fuel supply device 20 by way of the intake pipe 23 . However, when the fuel supply device 20 is provided in the inside of the fuel tank 18 having a small depth, the intake pipe 23 can be omitted. That is, it is possible to directly mount the filter 22 on an intake opening of the fuel pump 24 so as to lower the entire height of the fuel supply device 20. Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of the fuel supply device 20 from which the intake pipe 23 is omitted, wherein symbols which are equal to those in Fig. 1 indicate identical portions. [0031]<br>
Here, the fuel supply device 20 of the invention includes a type of fuel supply device which is provided with the pressure regulating valve 32 outside and is not provided inside the cylindrical housing 25 and the cap 26. For example, it may be possible that a pressure regulating valve is provided to the fuel hose 21 which connects the fuel supply device 20 and the fuel injection valve 49 and a return pipe from the pressure regulating valve is connected to the fuel supply device 20. [0032]<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the fuel supply device 20 showing a case in which the pressure regulating valve is<br>
not provided in the inside of the fuel supply device 20 and Fig. 7 is an top plan view of the fuel supply device 20, wherein symbols which are equal to those in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 indicate identical or similar parts. In these drawings, the return pipe from the pressure regulating valve not shown in the drawing is connected to a return hose joint 47. According to this example, the discharge passage 30 can be shortened by an amount corresponding to the elimination of the pressure regulating valve from the fuel supply device 20 and hence, a total length of the fuel supply device 20 can be shortened. [0033]<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, there is illustrated the example in which the fuel supply device is arranged such that the constitutional parts such as the pressure regulating valve, the check valve and the like are accommodated in the inside of the extension surface of the cylindrical profile of the fuel pump 24. However, the invention is not limited to such an example, and it may be sufficient that the respective constitutional parts of the fuel supply device are arranged such that the diameter of the cylinder which contains the fuel supply device which is formed into a module, that is, the fuel supply device which is formed into an integral body is minimized. [0034]<br>
That is, it is sufficient that in the inside of the<br>
cylindrical housing 25 which contains-the largest part (the fuel pump 24 in the above-mentioned example), other constitutional parts (the pressure regulating valve 32, the check valve 38 and the like) can be housed. Here, the maximum part implies a part which forms a maximum hollow sphere assuming hollow spheres which contain respective parts which constitute the fuel supply device.<br>
