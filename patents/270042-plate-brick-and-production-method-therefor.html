				<td>PLATE BRICK AND PRODUCTION METHOD THEREFOR<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a plate brick for use in a sliding nozzle device and other<br>
devices to control a flow rate of molten metal, in iron and steel industries, etc., and a production<br>
method for the plate brick.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
A refractory plate brick is used in a sliding nozzle device for controlling a flow rate of<br>
molten steel. The plate brick is commonly made using an alumina-carbon based material, and<br>
classified broadly into an unburned product and a burned product according to a production<br>
method therefor. Generally, the unburned product is produced by, after a shaping process,<br>
performing a heat treatment at a temperature of 100 to 300°C. The burned product is produced<br>
by performing a burning process at a high temperature of 1000°C or more, and, after the burning<br>
process, performing an impregnation treatment with pitch, tar or the like.<br>
[0003]<br>
However, the above plate bricks have a problem that they generate smoke and a pungent<br>
odor during use. This is because the unburned product generates a decomposition gas of a<br>
phenol resin as a binder, and the burned product generates a decomposition gas of tar or the like<br>
as an impregnant.<br>
[0004]<br>
Therefore, a so-called soft-burned product to be produced by performing a heat treatment at<br>
a temperature of 400 to 1000°C, i.e., a temperature intermediate between the above temperatures,<br><br>
was studied as a plate brick with less generation of the decomposition gas.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, the following Patent Document 1 discloses a production method which<br>
comprises kneading and forming a mixture of a refractory raw material, a phenol-based resin and<br>
an aluminum powder consisting of atomized spherical particles to obtain a shaped body, and then<br>
subjecting the shaped body to a heating treatment at a temperature of 550 to 650°C. The Patent<br>
Document 1 describes as follows. If the heating treatment temperature is less than 550°C,<br>
oxidation resistance of the phenol-based resin becomes inferior, and a decomposition gas of the<br>
phenol-based resin is generated to cause odor during use. If the heating treatment temperature<br>
is greater than 650°C, aluminum carbide will be formed. If aluminum carbide is formed, it<br>
easily reacts with water under normal temperature and normal pressure to form aluminum<br>
hydroxide, which involves a volume expansion and an increase in weight. Thus, it is highly<br>
likely that an obtained plate brick will crumble during storage.<br>
[0006]<br>
The following Patent Document 2 discloses a technique of adding a phenol resin to a<br>
mixture consisting of 90 to 99.5 weight% of aggregate of a refractory inorganic material, and 0.5<br>
to 10 weight% of aluminum or aluminum alloy fiber, and subjecting the mixture to a heat<br>
treatment at 700°C, 850°C or 1000°C. The Patent Document 2 described as follows. Based on<br>
performing the heat treatment at a temperature equal to or greater than a melting point of the<br>
aluminum or aluminum alloy (as for aluminum, 660°C), aluminum can be infiltrated between<br>
grains of a peripheral microstructure to dramatically improve strength of a refractory product and<br>
significantly enhance spalling resistance of the refractory product. If the heat treatment<br>
temperature is greater than 1000°C, desired characteristics as a fiber cannot be maintained, so<br>
that a difference in characteristics between a fiber and a powder will be lost. Moreover, along<br>
with progress of the aluminum infiltration, a void occurs in an area where the fiber has existed,<br>
so that it is rather likely that corrosion/erosion resistance will deteriorate.<br>
[0007]<br>
The following Patent Document 3 discloses a production method which comprises:<br>
preparing a refractory inorganic raw material, a carbon-based raw material and a metal-based<br><br>
raw material to allow the raw materials to form a continuous particle size distribution having a<br>
particle size of 0.1 to 4000 urn; adding a phenol resin to the raw materials; and burning the<br>
mixture in a non-oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of 800 to 1500°C, wherein no<br>
impregnation treatment is performed. The Patent Document 3 also discloses a refractory<br>
product subjected to a burning process at 850°C and having an apparent porosity of 5.0 %, as one<br>
example.<br>
[Patent Document 1 ] JP 2000-94121A<br>
[Patent Document 2] JP 1-313358A<br>
[Patent Document 3] JP 11 -199328A<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]<br>
[0008]<br>
In the production method disclosed in the Patent Document 1, an obtained plate brick is<br>
significantly inferior in durability to the conventional impregnated burned product, although the<br>
decomposition gas generation during use is reduced. One reason is that the phenol resin as a<br>
binding microstructure is decomposed and vaporized to form a porous microstructure, and<br>
thereby the plate brick is insufficient in strength. Another reason is that a strength development<br>
effect based on melting and reaction of aluminum is insufficient because the upper limit of the<br>
heat treatment temperature is set to a relatively low value of 650°C.<br>
[0009]<br>
On the other hand, in cases where the heat treatment is performed at a temperature of 660°C<br>
as the melting point of aluminum to 1000°C, as described in the Patent Documents 2 and 3,<br>
strength of an obtained plate brick is improved based on melting and reaction of aluminum, as<br>
compared with the Patent Document 1. However, durability of the plate brick largely varies<br>
depending on a value of the heat treatment temperature, and a plate brick having sufficient<br>
durability cannot be always obtained.<br>
[0010]<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a plate brick having a low<br><br>
amount of generation of smoke and a gas with a pungent odor during use, and exhibiting high<br>
durability, and a production method for the plate brick.<br>
[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM]<br>
[0011]<br>
In cases where a temperature for a heat treatment during production of a plate brick is in the<br>
range of 400 to 1000°C, melting of aluminum, formation of aluminum carbide, and formation of<br>
other aluminum compounds, occur during the heat treatment. Thus, characteristics of the plate<br>
brick after the heat treatment largely vary depending on a value of the heat treatment temperature.<br>
Consequently, in a conventional plate brick production method, plate bricks are obtained while<br>
becoming different from each other in terms of durability depending on conditions for the heat<br>
treatment.<br>
[0012]<br>
Therefore, the inventor carried out a practical test for a plurality of plate bricks subjected to<br>
a heat treatment at various temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000°C, to check generation of<br>
smoke/pungent Odor, and durability. As a result, the inventor has obtained knowledge that a<br>
plate brick having specific characteristics is useful as a plate brick having a low amount Of<br>
generation of smoke and a gas with a pungent odor, and exhibiting high durability, as compared<br>
with conventional plate bricks.<br>
[0013]<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a plate brick obtained by: adding an organic<br>
binder to a refractory raw material mixture containing 0.5 to 20 mass% of aluminum and/or<br>
aluminum alloy; kneading the mixture with the organic binder; forming the kneaded mixture into<br>
a shaped body; and subjecting the shaped body to a heat treatment at a temperature of 400 to<br>
1000°C, wherein the plate brick is obtained without being impregnated with a carbon-containing<br>
liquid material comprising tar or pitch, after the heat treatment. The plate brick has a<br>
compressive strength of 180 MPa or more, and a weight-increasing rate of 1 % or less as<br>
measured in a hydration test using an autoclave.<br>
[0014]<br><br>
If the temperature for the heat treatment during production of a plate brick is greater than<br>
400°C, the organic binder such as a phenol resin is decomposed and vaporized during the heat<br>
treatment, so that a microstructure of an obtained plate brick becomes excessively porous and<br>
thereby the plate brick has low strength. Consequently, durability of the plate brick<br>
deteriorates. On the other hand, when the heat treatment temperature is increased up to a<br>
certain level of temperature or more, melting and reaction of the aluminum and/or aluminum<br>
alloy occur, and thereby the strength is improved. Therefore, as a prerequisite to allowing a<br>
plate brick to have sufficient durability, it is necessary for the plate brick to have a compressive<br>
strength of 180 MPa or more. If the compressive strength is less than 180 MPa, the strength<br>
becomes insufficient, and thereby the durability becomes insufficient due to cracking,<br>
abrasion/wear, etc.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the plate brick of the present invention, the refractory raw material mixture containing<br>
0.5 to 20 mass% of aluminum and/or aluminum alloy is used, and the heat treatment is<br>
performed at a temperature of 400 to 1000°C. Thus, depending on production conditions, for<br>
example, when the heat treatment temperature is relatively high, the reaction of aluminum is<br>
likely to be excessively promoted to cause excessive formation of aluminum carbide. If<br>
aluminum carbide is excessively formed, hydration (slaking) resistance of an obtained plate brick<br>
will deteriorate. If the hydration resistance is insufficient, cracks will occur in a microstructure<br>
of the plate brick during storage to cause deterioration in the strength and therefore deterioration<br>
in the durability. Particularly in a hot and humid environment, hydration (slaking) occurs even<br>
in storage for a short period of time. Specifically, if a weight-increasing rate as measured in a<br>
hydration test using an autoclave is greater than 1 %, hydration is likely to occur during storage<br>
of a plate brick.<br>
[0016]<br>
In the plate brick of the present invention, the heat treatment temperature during the<br>
production may be set in the range of 400 to 800°C. This is because, if the heat treatment<br>
temperature is greater than 800°C, aluminum carbide is more likely to be excessively formed.<br>
[0017]<br><br>
to 3.5 mass%. In the plate brick having residual aluminum after the heat treatment, the residual<br>
aluminum selectively migrates to an area having a large heat load during actual use so as to<br>
maintain denseness through self-impregnation to effectively improve the durability. If the<br>
content rate is less than 0.5 mass%, the durability has a tendency to deteriorate. If the content<br>
rate is greater than 3.5 mass%, residual aluminum will be transformed into aluminum carbide<br>
and alumina, and thereby a microstructure of an obtained plate brick will be excessively<br>
densified to cause a tendency of the durability to deteriorate.<br>
[0021]<br>
As a result of researches of the inventor, it has also been found that a rate of change of<br>
aluminum in a plate brick before and after a heat treatment has a great impact on durability of the<br>
plate brick and generation of smoke during use. Further, it has been found that a plate brick<br>
satisfying the above characteristics can be produced by the following production method.<br>
[0022]<br>
The method comprises: adding an organic binder to a refractory raw material mixture<br>
containing 75 to 97 mass% of alumina-based raw material, 0.5 to 20 mass% of aluminum and/or<br>
aluminum alloy, and 0.1 to 15 mass% of one or more selected from the group consisting of<br>
silicon, clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide; kneading the mixture with the organic binder;<br>
forming the kneaded mixture into a shaped body; and subjecting the shaped body to a heat<br>
treatment, wherein the heat treatment is performed under conditions allowing a ratio of a content<br>
rate of aluminum in the plate brick after the heat treatment to a content rate of aluminum in the<br>
refractory raw material mixture to fall within the range of 20 to 60 %, and the plate brick is<br>
produced without being impregnated with a carbon-containing liquid material comprising tar or<br>
pitch, after the heat treatment.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the present invention, aluminum and an aluminum alloy is mixed in order to improve<br>
durability of the plate brick, as mentioned above, more specifically in order to form a binding<br>
microstructure through a reaction with the remaining refractory raw materials, atmosphere gas<br>
and/or the organic binder to improve strength of the plate brick, and prevent oxidation of the<br>
plate brick during use. If the mixed amount of the aluminum and aluminum alloy is less than<br><br>
0.5 mass%, the above effects become insufficient. If the mixed amount is greater than 20<br>
mass%, thermal shock resistance becomes deteriorated. Preferably, the aluminum alloy is one<br>
or more selected from the group consisting of an Al-Mg alloy, an Al-Si alloy and an Al-Mg-Si<br>
alloy, and a content rate of Al in the aluminum alloy is 30 mass% or more, in view of the<br>
strength-improving effect.<br>
[0024]<br>
In the production method of the present invention, the heat treatment is performed under<br>
conditions allowing a ratio ((B/A) * 100)) of a content rate (B mass%) of aluminum in the plate<br>
brick after the heat treatment to a content rate (A mass%) of aluminum in the refractory raw<br>
material mixture to fall within the range of 20 to 60 %. If the heat treatment is performed under<br>
conditions causing the ratio to become less than 20 %, wear will be increased to cause<br>
deterioration in the durability. If the heat treatment is performed under conditions causing the<br>
ratio to become greater than 60%, the reaction of the aluminum and/or aluminum alloy becomes<br>
insufficient to cause insufficiency of the strength, and a surface roughness of an obtained plate<br>
brick becomes larger to cause insufficiency of the durability and an increase in generation of gas<br>
during use. The content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture means a<br>
content rate of aluminum (Al) as a chemical component in aluminum and an aluminum alloy to<br>
be used as a refractory raw material. In cases where aluminum and an aluminum alloy are used<br>
in combination, the content rate of aluminum is a total content rate of respective Al components<br>
of the aluminum and aluminum alloy. Further, the content rate of aluminum in the plate brick<br>
means a content rate of Al as a metal contained in the plate brick.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the production method of the present invention, if the mixed amount of one or more<br>
selected from the group consisting of silicon, clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide is less than<br>
0.1 mass%, hydration resistance becomes insufficient. If the mixed amount is greater than 15<br>
mass%, excessive sintering will occur during use to cause deterioration in spalling resistance.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the production method of the present invention, the refractory raw material mixture may<br>
contain, as the alumina-based raw material, 10 to 40 mass% of high-performance<br><br>
zirconia-mullite obtained through a fusion process, wherein the zirconia-mullite comprises<br>
crystalline zirconia and mullite as primary components, with the remainder being corundum<br>
and/or a matrix glass, and wherein the crystalline zirconia includes a eutectic zirconia crystal<br>
having a grain size of 1.0 urn or less, and the matrix glass is contained in an amount of 5 mass%<br>
or less. The high-performance zirconia-mullite has a thermal expansion coefficient less than<br>
that of conventional zirconia-mullite, so that a plate brick having extremely excellent durability<br>
can be obtained.<br>
[EFFECT OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0027]<br>
The plate brick of the present invention obtained without being impregnated with tar, pitch<br>
or the like can exhibit durability equal to that of a conventional plate brick impregnated with tar<br>
or pitch.<br>
[0028]<br>
In addition, a harmful substance derived from the organic binder is mostly vaporized<br>
through the heat treatment, and an impregnation treatment with tar, pitch or the like is not<br>
performed, which makes it possible to significantly reduce generation of a harmful gas during<br>
use to suppress adverse effects on a human body and natural environments.<br>
[0029]<br>
In the plate brick production method of the present invention, based on controlling the<br>
content rate of aluminum after the heat treatment, a plate brick with less generation of smoke and<br>
a gas having a pungent odor during use and with excellent durability can be produced more<br>
reliably and stably.<br>
[0030]<br>
Further, the high-performance zirconia-mullite may be mixed in the refractory raw material<br>
mixture. In this case, the thermal shock resistance is further improved, so that a plate brick<br>
with enhanced durability can be produced.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0031]<br>
A plate brick of the present invention is produced while taking into account production<br>
conditions, by a production method which comprises: adding an organic binder to a refractory<br>
raw material mixture containing 0.5 to 20 mass% of aluminum and/or aluminum alloy; kneading<br>
the mixture with the organic binder; forming the kneaded mixture into a shaped body; and<br>
subjecting the shaped body to a heat treatment at a temperature of 400 to 1000°C, wherein the<br>
plate brick is produced without being impregnated with tar, pitch or the like.<br>
[0032]<br>
Specifically, the plate brick of the present invention can be obtained by the following<br>
production method of the present invention.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the production method of the present invention, aluminum and/or an aluminum alloy are<br>
mixed in a refractory raw material mixture in an amount of 0.5 to 20 mass%. When aluminum<br>
and an aluminum alloy is combined with an organic binder, it will produce a higher<br>
strength-improving effect after a heat treatment at a temperature of 400 to 1000°C, as compared<br>
with other metals. The aluminum and aluminum alloy may be any type of aluminum and<br>
aluminum alloy commonly used as a raw material for refractory products, and may be used in<br>
any suitable form, such as flaky form, atomized form or fibrous form. The aluminum alloy may<br>
be one or more selected from the group consisting of an Al-Mg alloy, an Al-Si alloy and an<br>
Al-Mg-Si alloy. More preferably, in view of the strength-improving effect, the aluminum alloy<br>
contains aluminum in an amount of 30 mass% or more. As with aluminum, each of the above<br>
aluminum alloys is capable of producing an oxidation-preventing effect during use, and reacting<br>
with the organic binder, atmosphere gas or other refractory raw material at a temperature of 400<br>
to 1000°C during the production to produce the strength-improving effect.<br>
[0034]<br>
The mixed amount of the aluminum and/or aluminum alloy in the refractory raw material<br>
mixture is set in the range of 0.5 to 20 mass%. More preferably, the mixed amount of the<br>
aluminum when used by itself, and the mixed amount of the aluminum alloy when used by itself,<br>
are set in the range of 0.5 to 10 mass% and the range of 0.5 to 20 mass%, respectively, and the<br><br>
total mixed amount of the aluminum and aluminum alloy when used in combination is set in the<br>
range of 1 to 20 mass%.<br>
[0035]<br>
In addition to the aluminum and/or aluminum alloy, any material commonly used as a raw<br>
material for refractory products may be mixed in the refractory raw material mixture without<br>
problems. For example, it may include an alumina-based raw material, a metal, a carbon-based<br>
raw material, clay, silicon carbide, and boron carbide.<br>
[0036]<br>
The alumina-based raw material may be one or more selected from the group consisting of<br>
alumina, mullite, alumina-magnesia spinel, zirconia-mullite, and alumina-zirconia.<br>
[0037]<br>
The zirconia-mullite may be a high-performance zirconia-mullite obtained through a fusion<br>
process, wherein the zirconia-mullite comprises crystalline zirconia and mullite as primary<br>
components, with the remainder being corundum and/or a matrix glass, and wherein the<br>
crystalline zirconia includes a eutectic zirconia crystal having a grain size of 1.0 µm or less, and<br>
the matrix glass is contained in an amount of 5 mass% or less. The high-performance<br>
zirconia-mullite may be a zirconia-mullite refractory material disclosed, for example, in PCT/JP<br>
2009/051632.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the present invention, the high-performance zirconia-mullite may be employed when the<br>
plate brick is used under conditions requiring higher thermal shock resistance. In this case, the<br>
plate brick can have enhanced thermal shock resistance to ensure durability at the same level as<br>
that of the conventional impregnated burned product.<br>
[0039]<br>
The metal other than the aluminum and aluminum alloy may be one or more selected from<br>
the group consisting of chromium, chromium alloy, magnesium, iron, nickel and silicon, and<br>
may be used in an amount of 0.1 to 10 mass%. Among them, silicon is particularly preferable,<br>
because it is highly effective in improving hydration resistance.<br>
[0040]<br><br>
The carbon-based raw material may be one or more selected from the group consisting of<br>
graphite, pitch and carbon black, and may be used in an amount of 0.1 to 10 mass%. The<br>
carbon-based raw material has an effect of improving thermal shock resistance.<br>
[0041]<br>
One or more of clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide may be used in combination with the<br>
aluminum and/or aluminum alloy to allow the plate brick to have improved oxidation resistance<br>
and hydration resistance. One or more of clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide may be used<br>
in an amount of 0.1 to 10 mass%.<br>
[0042]<br>
One or more of silicon, clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide may be contained in the<br>
refractory raw material mixture in an amount of 0.1 to 15 mass% to further improve the<br>
hydration resistance and the oxidation resistance. Specifically, it is more preferable that the<br>
refractory raw material mixture comprises 75 to 97 mass% of alumina-based raw material, 0.5 to<br>
20 mass% of aluminum and/or aluminum alloy, and 0.1 to 15 mass% of one or more selected<br>
from the group consisting of silicon, clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide.<br>
[0043]<br>
In order to eliminate the need for an impregnation treatment with a carbon-containing liquid<br>
material such as tar or pitch, it is preferable that a particle distribution of the refractory raw<br>
material mixture is designed while taking into account densification and strength enhancement<br>
by a reaction of aluminum during the heat treatment. This makes it possible to obtain a plate<br>
brick having a low porosity and exhibiting strength and thermal shock resistance in a<br>
well-balanced manner. More specifically, it is preferable that a fraction having a particle size<br>
of 1 mm to 3 mm, a fraction having a particle size of 100 urn to less than 1 mm, a fraction having<br>
a particle size of 10 µm to less than 100 µm, and a fraction having a particle size of less than 10<br>
urn, are contained in an amount of 15 to 45 mass%, in an amount of 20 to 40 mass%, in an<br>
amount of 10 to 30 mass%, and in an amount of 10 to 30 mass%, respectively. If the rate of the<br>
coarse particle fraction having a particle size of 1 mm to 3 mm is less than 15 mass%, an elastic<br>
modulus will be increased to cause a tendency of the thermal shock resistance to deteriorate. If<br>
the rate is greater than 45 mass%, a microstructure of an obtained plate brick becomes<br><br>
excessively porous to cause a tendency of the durability to deteriorate. If the rate of the<br>
intermediate particle fraction having a particle size of 100 um to less than 1 mm is less than 20<br>
mass%, the thermal shock resistance has a tendency to deteriorate. If the rate is greater than 40<br>
mass%, a microstructure of an obtained plate brick becomes excessively porous to cause a<br>
tendency of the strength and corrosion/erosion resistance to deteriorate. If the rate of the fine<br>
particle fraction having a particle size of 10 µm to less than 100 µm is less than 10 mass%, a<br>
microstructure of an obtained plate brick becomes excessively porous to cause a tendency of the<br>
strength and corrosion/erosion resistance to deteriorate. If the rate is greater than 30 mass%,<br>
the thermal shock resistance has a tendency to deteriorate. If the rate of the ultrafine particle<br>
fraction having a particle size of less than 10 µm is less than 10 mass%, a microstructure of an<br>
obtained plate brick becomes excessively porous to cause a tendency of the strength to<br>
deteriorate. If the rate is greater than 30 mass%, a microstructure of an obtained plate brick<br>
becomes excessively dense to cause a tendency of the thermal shock resistance to deteriorate.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the present invention, an organic binder is added to the above refractory raw material<br>
mixture, and the mixture with the organic binder is kneaded. Then, the kneaded mixture is<br>
formed into a given shape by friction press or oil hydraulic press, and the shaped body is<br>
subjected to a heat treatment.<br>
[0045]<br>
The organic binder to be added to the refractory raw material mixture may be one or more<br>
of various resins commonly used as a binder for refractory materials, such as a phenol resin, a<br>
furan resin and a silicon (silicone) resin. The organic binder may be used after it is diluted with<br>
a solvent such as ethylene glycol to adjust a viscosity thereof.<br>
[0046]<br>
Among the above organic binders, it is preferable to use a phenol resin and a silicon<br>
(silicone) resin in combination. This makes it possible to drastically improve the hydration<br>
resistance of the plate brick produced through a heat treatment at a temperature of 400 to<br>
1000°C. Heretofore, it has been known that a silicon (silicone) resin is excellent in oxidation<br>
resistance and strength. The present invention is based on new knowledge that a silicon<br><br>
(silicone) resin has a significantly excellent effect of improving hydration resistance of a plate<br>
brick produced by using aluminum and/or aluminum alloy and through a heat treatment at a<br>
temperature of 400 to 1000"C. Thus, quality deterioration due to hydration will never occur<br>
even if an impregnation treatment with tar or pitch as in the conventional plate brick is omitted.<br>
[0047]<br>
Preferably, the heat treatment is performed under a condition that an object to be<br>
heat-treated (a shaped body for a plate brick) is sealed from ambient air, for example, under a<br>
condition that the object is enclosed in a container, or under a condition that the container is<br>
filled with coke particles or an internal space of the container is kept in a nitrogen gas<br>
atmosphere, i.e., in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. This makes it possible to prevent oxidation<br>
during the heat treatment to obtain a denser and higher-strength plate brick.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the present invention, the heat treatment can be performed under conditions allowing a<br>
ratio of a content rate of aluminum in the plate brick after the heat treatment to a content rate of<br>
aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture to fall within the range of 20 to 60 %.<br>
[0049]<br>
In order to determine the conditions for the heat treatment, a test is carried out several times<br>
in an intended heat-treating furnace while changing heat treatment conditions at a temperature of<br>
400 to 1000°C, and a content rate of aluminum in a plate brick after the heat treatment is<br>
quantitatively analyzed. Then, heat treatment conditions, such as a heat-treating furnace, a heat<br>
treatment temperature, a holding time, a muffle configuration and a temperature rise rate, which<br>
allow a ratio of a content rate of aluminum in the plate brick after the heat treatment to a content<br>
rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture to fall within the range of 20 to 60 %,<br>
are determined. The term "heat treatment temperature" here means a temperature to be<br>
measured so as to control a temperature of the heat-treating furnace. In cases where the heat<br>
treatment temperature is measured outside a container under the condition that an object is<br>
enclosed in the container as mentioned above, the heat treatment temperature is likely to become<br>
different from a temperature of the object. Once the heat treatment conditions are determined,<br>
the heat treatment can be performed under the determined conditions without subsequently<br><br>
measuring an amount of aluminum in each heat treatment.<br>
[0050]<br>
The content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture can be derived from a<br>
calculation based on a mixed rate of aluminum. In cases where an aluminum alloy is used, the<br>
content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture can also be derived from a<br>
calculation based on a content rate of aluminum in the aluminum alloy. In the present<br>
invention, the term "refractory raw material mixture" means a refractory raw material mixture<br>
without containing a binder, and a liquid such as a solvent or water.<br>
[0051]<br>
The content rate of aluminum in the plate brick after the heat treatment can be derived by a<br>
conventional method, such as an ICP method or a wet method.<br>
[0052]<br>
After the heat treatment, the object is used as a plate brick without being impregnated with a<br>
carbon-containing liquid material such as tar or pitch.<br>
[EXAMPLES]<br>
[0053]<br>
An organic binder was added to each of a plurality of types of refractory raw material<br>
mixtures illustrated in Tables 1 to 3. Then, the mixture with the organic binder was kneaded,<br>
and the kneaded mixture was formed into a given shape of a plate brick, by friction press. The<br>
shaped body was dried and then subjected to a heat treatment at each temperature in Tables 1 to<br>
3. A size of the plate brick was set to be about 500 mm in length, about 200 mm in width, and<br>
about 40 mm in thickness.<br>
[0054]<br>
The heat treatment was performed by putting the shaped body into a container, filling the<br>
container with coke particles,' and then setting the container in a heat-treating furnace (electric<br>
furnace). A temperature rise rate was set to 50°C/h, and then each heat treatment temperature<br>
in Tables 1 to 3 was held for 7 hours. After elapse of the holding time, heating was stopped.<br>
When an internal temperature of the furnace was reduced to 400°C or less, the closed container<br><br>
was taken out of the furnace. Then, when the container was cooled to a handJeable<br>
temperature, the heat-treated body (plate brick) was taken out of the container. The heat<br>
treatment temperature was controlled by a thermocouple installed in an upper portion of the<br>
closed container.<br>
[0055]<br>
A test sample was cut from the plate brick after the heat treatment to measure an apparent<br>
porosity and a compressive strength according to respective ones of a method of JIS-R 2205 and<br>
a method of JIS-R 2206. A gas generation amount was measured at a heat treatment<br>
temperature of 1000°C, according to the standard test method of the JACT and using a PGD-type<br>
meter produced by George Fischer, Inc. In this regard, the test sample was dried at 110°C for<br>
24 hours, in advance of the measurement of the gas generation amount. As for smoke and odor,<br>
a test was carried out in a job site. Specifically, when a maintenance operation of a 70-ton ladle<br>
was performed in the job side just after a first cycle of casting, smoke and odor generated from a<br>
plate brick of a sliding nozzle for the ladle were observed by human senses. In Tables 1 to 3, a<br>
plate brick having smoke or odor is denoted by "x", and a plate brick having almost no smoke<br>
and no odor is denoted by "o". A hydration test was performed in the following manner. A<br>
sample having a length of 20 mm, a width of 20 mm and a height of 20 mm was prepared.<br>
After drying the sample at 110°C for 24 hours, a weight Wl of the dried sample was measured.<br>
The dried sample was put into a beaker, and the beaker was covered by a watch glass to prevent<br>
water droplets from entering into the sample. Then, the beaker was placed in an autoclave.<br>
The beaker was heated, and held at a pressure of 0.3 MPa for 3 hours. Then, after cooling, the<br>
sample was taken out of the beaker and dried at 110°C for 24 hours, and a weight W2 of the<br>
dried sample was measured. A weight-increasing rate (%) was calculated by the following<br>
formula: 100 * (W2 - Wl) / Wl.<br>
[0056]<br>
A content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture was derived from a<br>
calculation, based on a mixed rate of aluminum and/or aluminum alloy, and a content rate of<br>
aluminum in the plate brick after the heat treatment was quantitatively determined by an ICP<br>
method. In Tables 1 to 3, aluminum as a refractory raw material is comprised of 100 mass% of<br><br>
Al component, and aluminum-magnesium alloy as a refractory raw material is comprised of 50<br>
mass% of Al component and 50 mass% of Mg component.<br>
[0057]<br>
The plate brick after the heat treatment was stored in a room at a humidity of 90 % and at a<br>
temperature of 30°C, for 20 days, and then subjected to a practical test. A set of five plate<br>
bricks were used in a molten steel ladle, and, from the fifth charge, a damage state in each of the<br>
plate bricks was visually checked before use to determine whether the plate brick is usable.<br>
Tables 1 to 3 show an average number of usable cycles of the five plate bricks.<br>
[0058]<br>
Inventive Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative examples 1 to 7 illustrated in Table 1 are plate<br>
bricks produced at different heat treatment temperatures. As the heat treatment temperature<br>
becomes higher, the compressive strength tends to be much more improved, and the apparent<br>
porosity tends to become higher. Each of the Inventive Examples 1 to 4 is a plate brick<br>
produced at a heat treatment temperature of 650°C, 700°C or 750°C, to have a compressive<br>
strength of 180 MPa or more and a weight-increasing rate as measured in the hydration test of 1<br>
% or less, which fall within the scope of the present invention. Further, a ratio of a content rate<br>
of aluminum in the plate brick after the heat treatment to a content rate of aluminum in the<br>
refractory raw material mixture is in the range of 20 to 60 %, which falls within the scope of the<br>
present invention. The Inventive Examples 1 to 4 are excellent in durability as evidenced by<br>
the fact that the number of usable cycles in the practical test is 8 or 9. As compared with the<br>
Inventive Example 2, the Inventive Example 3 is different only in that a combination of a phenol<br>
resin and a silicon (silicone) resin is used as the organic resin. As seen in Table 1, the Inventive<br>
Example 3 is excellent in hydration resistance, and increased in denseness and strength.<br>
Further, the usable life (the number of usable cycles) is increased by one.<br>
[0059]<br>
In contrast, in the Comparative Example 4 where the heat treatment temperature is set to<br>
600°C, the compressive strength is lowered to 169 MPa, and the number of usable cycles is<br>
reduced to 6. Moreover, the ratio of a content rate of aluminum in the plate brick after the heat<br>
treatment to a content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material mixture is largely<br><br>
increased to 68%. It would be considered that, in the Comparative Example 4, the melting and<br>
reaction of aluminum become insufficient due to the relatively low heat treatment temperature,<br>
and thereby sufficient strength could not be obtained. The Comparative Examples 2 and 3<br>
where the heat treatment temperature is set to 450°C and 550°C, have the same tendency.<br>
[0060]<br>
In the Comparative Example 5, the heat treatment temperature is set to 850°C, but the<br>
weight-increasing rate as measured in the hydration test is 1.1 %, which is out of the scope of the<br>
present invention. In the Comparative Example 5, the ratio of a content rate of aluminum in the<br>
plate brick after the heat treatment to a content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw material<br>
mixture is reduced to 16%. Thus, it would be considered that aluminum carbide is excessively<br>
formed. Moreover, in the Comparative Example 5, the durability in the practical test<br>
deteriorates. This means that an excessively small amount of the residual aluminum causes a<br>
tendency of the durability to deteriorate. The Comparative Example 6 where the heat treatment<br>
temperature is set to 1000°C has the same tendency.<br>
[0061]<br>
The Comparative Example 1 is a conventional unburned product, and the Comparative<br>
Example 7 is a conventional burned product impregnated with tar after burning. In the<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 7, the gas generation amount is increased to 20.2 cc/g and 14.7<br>
cc/g, respectively.<br>
[0062]<br>
Inventive Examples 5 to 7 illustrated in Table 2 are plate bricks using an<br>
aluminum-magnesium alloy. As compared with a plate brick using only aluminum, each of the<br>
Inventive Examples 5 to 7 has sufficient strength and superior hydration resistance even if the<br>
heat treatment temperature is relatively low. Further, the ratio of a content rate of aluminum in<br>
the plate brick after the heat treatment to a content rate of aluminum in the refractory raw<br>
material mixture falls within the scope of the present invention, and excellent durability is<br>
exhibited.<br>
[0063]<br>
Inventive Example 8 is a plate brick using a refractory raw material mixture comprising<br><br>
alumina-magnesia spinal mixed as the alumina-based raw material. The Inventive Example 8<br>
also exhibits sufficient durability.<br>
[0064]<br>
Inventive Examples 9 to 12 are plate bricks produced while changing the mixed amount of<br>
the aluminum and the particle distribution of the refractory raw material mixture. When the<br>
content rate of aluminum after the heat treatment becomes equal to or greater than 5 mass%, the<br>
durability (the number of usable cycles) becomes deteriorated as compared with the example<br>
where it is less than 5 mass%. However, the durability falls within a level causing no practical<br>
problem.<br>
[0065]<br>
Inventive Examples 15 and 16 illustrated in Table 3 are plate bricks using a<br>
high-performance zirconia-mullite (zirconia-mullite B) where a eutectic zirconia crystal has a<br>
grain size of 1.0 µm or less, and a matrix glass is contained in an amount of 5 mass% or less.<br>
As compared with Inventive Examples 13 and 14 using conventional zirconia-mullite<br>
(zirconia-mullite A), the Inventive Examples 15 and 16 are superior in the durability in the<br>
practical test. The zirconia-mullite A used in the Inventive Examples 13 and 14 comprises, as<br>
chemical components, 44 mass% of AI2O3, 37 mass% of Z1O2 and 18 mass% of SiO2, wherein a<br>
matrix glass is contained in an amount of 0.9 mass%, and a eutectic zirconia crystal has a grain<br>
size of 2.5 µm. The high-performance zirconia-mullite (zirconia-mullite B) used in the<br>
Inventive Examples 15 and 16 comprises, as chemical components, 44 mass% of Al2O3, 37<br>
mass% of Zr02 and 18 mass% of Si02, wherein a matrix glass is contained in an amount of 0.9<br>
mass%, and a eutectic zirconia crystal has a grain size of 0.2 µm.<br>
[0066]<br>
Comparative Example 9 is a plate brick using a refractory raw material mixture devoid of<br>
silicon, clay, silicon carbide and boron carbide. As seen in Table 3, the Comparative Example<br>
9 is high in the weight-increasing rate as measured in the hydration test, and inferior in the<br>
hydration resistance to Inventive example 17 containing silicon and using a combination of a<br>
phenol resin and a silicon (silicone) resin as the organic binder,<br>
