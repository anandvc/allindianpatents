FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new glucoamylases useful for the production of glucose and other end products from starch. The glucoamylases are suitable for use in various processes and are particularly suitable for use under conditions of conventional high temperature starch processing and under conditions of non-cook or low temperature starch processing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucoamylase enzymes (Î±-l,4-glucan glucohydrolases, E.C.3.2.1.3.) are starch hydrolyzing exo-acting carbohydrases. Glucoamylases catalyze the removal of successive<br><br>
glucose units from the non-reducing ends of starch or related oligo and polysaccharide molecules and can hydrolyze both linear and branched glucosidic linkages of starch (amylose and amylopectin).<br>
Glucoamylases are produced by numerous strains of bacteria, fungi, yeast and plants. Particularly interesting glucoamylases are fungal enzymes that are extracellularly produced, for example from strains of Aspergillus (Boel et.al., (1984) EMBO J 3:1097-1102; Hayashida et al (1989) Agric. Biol Chem. 53:923 - 929; USP 5,024,941; USP 4,794,175; and WO 88/09795), Talaromyces (USP 4,247,637; USP 6,255,084 and USP 6,620,924), Rhizopus (Ashikari et al. (1986) Agric. Biol. Chem. 50:957 - 964; Ashikari et al. (1989) App. Microbiol. and Biotech. 32:129 - 133 and USP 4,863,864), Humicola (WO05/052148 and USP 4,618,579) and Mucor (Houghton-Larsen et al., (2003) Appl Microbiol. Biotechnol., 62: 210- 217). Many of the genes, which code for these enzymes have been cloned and expressed in yeast and fungal cells.<br>
Commercially glucoamylases are very important enzymes that have been used in a wide variety of applications requiring the hydrolysis of starch. Glucoamylases are used for the hydrolysis of starch to produce high fructose corn sweeteners, and corn sweeteners comprise over 50% of the US sweetener market. In general, starch hydrolyzing processes involve the use of alpha amylases to hydrolyze the starch to dextrins and glucoamylases to hydrolyze the-dextrins to glucose. The glucose is then converted to fructose by other enzymes such as glucose isomerases. Glucose produced by glucoamylases can also be crystallized or used in fermentations to produce other end-products, such as citric acid, ascorbic acid, glutamic acid, 1, 3 propanediol and others. Glucoamylases are used in alcohol production, such as beer production and sake production. Glucoamylases also find use in the production of ethanol for fuel and for consumption. Recently, glucoamylases have been used in low-temperature processes for the hydrolysis of granular (non-cooked) starch. Glucoamylases are also used hi the preparation of animal feeds as feed additives or as liquid feed components for livestock animals.<br>
Although glucoamylases have been used successfully for many years, a need still exists for new useful glucoamylases. The present invention is based upon the finding of novel glucoamylases suitable for use in various applications and particularly starch conversion processes.<br><br>

In other embodiments, the invention is related to a starch binding domain having at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, and at least 98% sequence identity to the starch binding domain of the glucoamylase illustrated in SEQ ID NO: 4. In some embodiments, the starch binding domain encompasses the sequence of residue position 524 to residue position 632 of SEQ ID NO: 4 and is represented by SEQ ID NO: 42.<br>
In other embodiments, the starch binding domain is a fragment of the starch binding domain of SEQ ID NO: 4. Preferably a fragment will encompass at least 90, at least 80 or at least 70 ammo acid residues of the starch binding domain of SEQ ID NO: 4.<br>
Homology of the Protein Sequence<br>
The homology between two glucoamylases may be determined by the degree of identity between the amino acid sequences of two protein sequences. A polypeptide or polynucleotide having a certain percent of identity with another sequence (i.e. 80%, 90%, and 95%) means that when aligned, that percent of bases or amino acid residues are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and percent homology or identity can be determined by using any suitable software program known in the art. For example suitable programs are described in CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (Ausubel et al., eds 1995, Chapter 19). Preferred programs include GCG Pileup program (Wisconsin Package, Version 8.1 and 10.0), FAST A, BLAST and TFASTA. Another preferred alignment program is ALIGN or ALIGN Plus (Dayhoff (1978) in ATLAS OF PROTEIN SEQUENCE AND STRUCTURE 5: Suppl. 3 (National Biomedical Research Foundation)) Further BLASTP, BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms can be used (Altschul et al., (1990)7. Mol Biol. 215:403-410). Other useful methods include ClustralW (Thompson et al., (1997) Nucleic Acid Research 25:4876 -4882) using software provide by DNASTAR (Madison WI). Also reference is made to Needleman et al., (1970) J. Mol. BioL 48:443, Smith et al., (1981) Adv. AppL Math. 2:482, Smith et al., (1997) Meth. Mol. Biol. 70:173-187 and Pearson et al., (1988) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 85:24444.<br>

In some embodiments, an amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 4 will include conservative amino acid substitutions using L-amino acids, wherein one amino acid is replaced by another biologically similar amino acid. Conservative amino acid substitutions are those that preserve the general charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and/or steric bulk of the amino acid being substituted. Non-limiting examples of conservative substitutions include those between the following groups: Gly/Ala, Val/Ile/Leu, Lys/Arg, Asn/Gln, Glu/Asp, Ser/Cys/Thr and Phe/Trp/Tyr.

Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, more than one codon may be used to code for a particular amino acid. Therefore, different DNA sequences may encode a polypeptide having exactly the same amino acid sequence as the polypeptide of, for example SEQ ID NO: 4. The present invention encompasses polynucleotides, which encode the same polypeptide. DNA sequences, which encode glucoamylases encompassed by the-invention may or may not include introns.<br>
Homology of DNA sequences is determined by the degree of identity between two DNA sequences. Homology may be determined using computer programs as described above for determining protein sequence homology.<br>
A nucleic acid is hybridizable to another nucleic acid when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid can anneal to the other nucleic acid under appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength. Hybridization and washing conditions are well known in the art for hybridization under low, medium, medium/high, high and very high stringency conditions (See., e.g. Sambrook et al., supra, particularly chapters 9 and 11). hi general, hybridization involves a nucleotide probe and a homologous DNA sequence that form stable double stranded hybrids by extensive base-pairing of complementary polynucleotides (See, Chapter 8, GeneCloning, An Introduction, T.A. Brown, (1995) Chapman and Hall, London).<br>
The filter with the probe and homologous sequence are washed in 2x sodium chloride /sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5%SDS at about 60Â°C (medium stringency); 65Â°C (medium/high stringency) 70Â°C (high stringency) and about 75Â°C (very high stringency).<br>
Vectors<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a DNA construct comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a glucoamylase encompassed by the invention and operably linked to a promoter sequence is assembled to transfer into a host cell. The DNA<br><br>
construct may be introduced into a host cell using a vector. The vector may be any vector which when introduced into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome and is replicated. Vectors include cloning vectors, expression vectors, shuttle vectors, plasmids, phage particles, cassettes and the like. In some preferred embodiments, the vector is an expression vector that comprises regulatory sequences operably linked to the glucoamylase coding sequence.<br>
Examples of suitable expression and/or integration vectors are provided in Sambrook et al., (1989) supra, and Ausubel (1987) supra, and van den Hondel et al. (1991) in Bennett and Lasure (Eds.) MORE GENE MANIPULATIONS IN FUNGI, Academic Press pp. 396-428 and U.S. Patent No. 5,874,276. Reference is also made to the Fungal Genetics Stock Center Catalogue of Strains (FGSC, ) for a list of vectors. Particularly useful vectors include vectors obtained from for examples Invitrogen and Promega. Specific vectors suitable for use in fungal host cells include vectors such as pFB6, pBR322, pUCIS, pUClOO, pDONâ¢201, pDONRâ¢221, pENTRâ¢, pGEMÂ®3Z and pGEMÂ®4Z.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the promoter, which shows transcriptional activity in a fungal host cell may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. The promoter may be a mutant, truncated and hybrid promoter. Preferably, the promoter is useful in a Trichoderma or Aspergillus host. Exemplary promoters include the T. reesei promoters cbh\, cbh2, eg/1, eg/2, eg5, xlnl and xln2. Other examples of useful promoters include promoters from A. awamori and A. niger glucoamylase genes (glaA) (See, Nunberg et al, (1984) Mol. Cell Biol 4:2306-2315 and Boel et al, (1984) EMBO J. 3:1581-1585), Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase genes and Rhizomucor miehei lipase genes.<br>
hi one embodiment, the promoter is one that is native to the host cell. For example, when T. reesei is the host, the promoter is a native T. reesei promoter.<br>
In another embodiment, the promoter is one that is heterologous to the fungal host cell.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, the promoter is T. reesei cbhl, which is an inducible promoter and has been deposited in GenBank under Accession No. D86235.<br>
An "inducible promoter" is a promoter that is active under environmental or developmental regulation. In some embodiments, the DNA construct includes nucleic<br><br>
acids coding for a signal sequence that is an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of the polypeptide which directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5' end of the coding sequence of the nucleic acid sequence may naturally include a signal peptide coding region which is naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the glucoamylase coding sequence which encodes the secreted glucoamylase or the 5' end of the coding sequence of the nucleic acid sequence may include a signal peptide which is foreign to the coding sequence. In some preferred embodiments, the DNA construct includes a signal sequence that is naturally associated with the glucoamylase gene to be expressed. Effective signal sequences may include the signal sequences obtained from glucoamylases of other filamentous fungal cells, such as from Humicola, Aspergillus, and Rhizopus.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid of the DNA construct codes for a signal sequence having at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% and at least 99% sequence identity to the signal sequence depicted in Figure 3.<br>
In additional embodiments, a DNA construct or vector comprising a signal sequence and a promoter sequence to be introduced into a fungal host cell are derived from the same source. For example, in some embodiments, the signal sequence is the cbhl signal sequence which is operably linked to a cbhl promoter. In other preferred embodiments the native glucoamylase signal sequence of a Trichoderma/Hypocrea family cluster member will be used.<br>
In some embodiments, the expression vector also includes a termination sequence. Any terminator sequence functional in the host cell may be used in the present invention. In one embodiment, the termination sequence and the promoter sequence are derived from the same source. In another embodiment, the termination sequence is homologous to the host cell. A particularly suitable terminator sequence is cbhl derived from a Trichoderma strain and particularly T. reesei. Other useful fungal terminators include the terminator from A. niger or A. awamori glucoamylase genes (Nunberg et al. (1984) supra, and Boel et al, (1984) supra), Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase g,eaes,.Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase genes, or A nidulans trpC (Punt et al., (1987) Gene 56:117 - 124).<br>
In some embodiments, an expression vector includes a selectable marker. Examples of preferred selectable markers include ones which confer antimicrobial resistance (e.g., hygromycin and phleomycin). Nutritional selective markers also find use<br><br>
in the present invention including those markers known in the art as and S, argR and pyr4. Markers useful in vector systems for transformation of Trichodertna are known in the art (See, e.g., Finkelstein, chapter 6 in BIOTECHNOLOGY OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGI, Finkelstein et al. Eds. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA (1992), Chap. 6.; and Kinghorn et al. (1992) APPLIED MOLECULAR GENETICS OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGI, Blackie Academic and Professional, Chapman and Hall, London). In a preferred embodiment, the selective marker is the anidS gene, which encodes the enzyme acetamidase, allowing transformed cells to grow on acetamide as a nitrogen source. The use of A. nidulans amdS gene as a selective marker is described in Kelley et al, (1985) EMBO J. 4:475 - 479 and Penttila et al, (1987) Gene 61:155-164.<br>
Methods used to ligate the DNA construct comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a glucoamylase, a promoter, a terminator and other sequences and to insert them into a suitable vector are well known in the art. Linking is generally accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, synthetic oligonucleotide linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. (See, Sambrook (1989) supra, and Bennett and Lasure, MORE GENE MANIPULATIONS IN FUNGI, Academic Press, San Diego (1991) pp 70 - 76.). Additionally, vectors can be constructed using known recombination techniques (e.g., Invitrogen Life Technologies, Gateway Technology).<br>
Host Cells<br>
The present invention also relates to host cells comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a glucoamylase of the invention, which are used in the production of the glucoamylases of the invention. Preferred host cells according to the invention are filamentous fungal cells, and the term host cell includes both the cells, progeny of the cells and protoplasts created from the cells of a filamentous fungal strains.<br>
The term "filamentous fungi" refers to all filamentous forms of the subdivision Eumycotina (See, Alexopoulos, C. J. (1962), INTRODUCTORY MYCOLOGY, Wiley, New York). These fungi are characterized by a vegetative mycelium with a cell wall composed of chitin, cellulose, and other complex polysaccharides. The filamentous fungi of the present invention are morphologically, physiologically, and genetically distinct from yeasts. Vegetative growth by filamentous fungi is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligatory aerobic. In the present invention, the filamentous fungal parent<br><br>
cell may be a cell of a species of, but not limited to, Trichodenna, (e.g., Trichoderma reesei, the asexual morph of Hypocreajecorina, T. longibrachiatum, Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma harz.ia.nuni); Penicillium sp., Humicola sp. (e.g., H insolens, H. lanuginosa and H. grisea); Chrysosporium sp. (e.g., C. lucknowense), Gliocladium sp., Aspergillus sp. (e.g., A. oryzae, A. niger, A. nidulans, and A awamori),<br>
Fusarium sp.,(e.g. F. graminum and F. venenatum), Neurospora sp., Hypocrea sp.,<br>
i	<br>
Mucor, and Emericella sp. (See also, Innis et al., (1985) Sci. 228:21 -26). The term "Trichoderma" or "Trichoderma sp." refer to any fungal genus previously or currently classified as Trichoderma. In some embodiments, the host cell will be a genetically engineered host cell wherein native genes have been inactivated, for example by deletion. Where it is desired to obtain a fungal host cell having one or more inactivated genes known methods may be used (e.g. methods disclosed hi U.S. Patent No. 5,246,853, U.S. Patent No. 5,475,101 and WO92/06209). Gene inactivation may be accomplished by complete or partial deletion, by insertional inactivation or by any other means which renders a gene nonfunctional for its intended purpose (such that the gene is prevented from expression of a functional protein). Any gene from a Trichoderma sp. or other filamentous fungal host, which has been cloned can be deleted, hi some preferred embodiments, when the host cell is a Trichoderma cell and particularly a T. reesei host cells the cbhl, cbh2, egll and egl2 genes will be inactivated and preferably deleted. Particualrly preferred Trichoderma reesei host cells having quad-deleted proteins are set forth and described in USP 5,847,276 and WO 05/001036.<br>
Transformation of Host Cells<br>
Introduction of a DNA construct or vector into a host cell includes techniques such as transformation; electroporation; nuclear microinjection; transduction; transfection, (e.g., lipofection mediated and DEAE-Dextrin mediated transfection); incubation with calcium phosphate DNA precipitate; high velocity bombardment with DNA-coated microprojectiles; and protoplast fusion. General transformation techniques are known in the art (See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (1987), supra, chapter 9; and Sambrook (1989) supra, and Campbell etal, (1989) Curr. Genet. 16:53-56). The expression of heterologous protein in Trichoderma is described in USP 6,022,725; USP 6,268,328; Harkki et al. (1991); Enzyme Microb. Technol. 13:227-233; Harkki et al., (1989) Bio Technol. 7:596-<br><br>
603; EP 244,234; EP 215,594; and Nevalainen et al, "Tlie Molecular Biology of Trichvderma and its Application to the Expression of Both Homologous and Heterologous Genes", in MOLECULAR INDUSTRIAL MYCOLOGY, Eds. Leong and Berka, Marcel Dekker Inc., NY (1992) pp. 129 - 148). Reference is also made to Cao et al., (2000) Sci. 9:991 -1001 and EP 238 023 for transformation of Aspergillm strains and WO96/00787 for transformation of Fusarium strains.<br>
Preferably, genetically stable transformants are constructed with vector systems whereby the nucleic acid encoding the glucoamylase is stably integrated into a host strain chromosome. Transformants are then purified by known techniques, hi one nonlimiting example, stable transformants including an amdS marker are distinguished from unstable transformants by their faster growth rate and the formation of circular colonies with a smooth, rather than ragged outline on solid culture medium containing acetamide. Additionally, in some cases a further test of stability is conducted by growing the transformants on solid non-selective medium (i.e., NH4(SO2) (5 mg/mL) as a nitrogen source), harvesting spores from this culture medium and determining the percentage of these spores which subsequently germinate and grow on selective medium containing lOmM acetamide as a sole nitrogen source. Alternatively, other methods known in the art may be used to select transformants.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the preparation of Trichoderma sp. for transformation involves the preparation of protoplasts from fungal mycelia (See, Campbell et al., (1989) Curr, Genet. 16:53-56). Also agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of filamentous fungi is known (See, de Groot et al., (1998) Nat. Biotechnol. 16:839 - 842).<br>
In some embodiments, the mycelia are obtained from germinated vegetative spores. The mycelia are treated with an enzyme that digests the cell wall resulting in protoplasts. The protoplasts are then protected by the presence of an osmotic stabilizer in the suspending medium. These stabilizers include sorbitol, mannitol, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate and the like. Usually the concentration of these stabilizers varies between 0.8 M and 1.2 M. It is preferable to use about a 1.2 M solution of sorbitol in the suspension medium. Uptake of DNA into the host Trichoderma sp. strain is dependent upon the calcium ion concentration. Generally, between about 10 mM CaCla and 50 mM CaCl2 is used in an uptake solution. Reference is also made to USP 6,022,725 and USP 6,268,328 for transformation procedures used with filamentous fungal hosts.<br><br>
The present invention relates to methods of recombinantly producing the glucoamylase comprising expressing a polynucleotide encoding a glucoamylase of the invention in a filamentous fungal host cell and cultivating the host cell under conditions suitable for production of the glucoamylase and optionally recovering the glucoamylase.<br>
In the expression and production methods of the present invention the fungal cells are cultured under suitable conditions in shake flask cultivation, small scale or large scale fermentations (including continuous, batch and fed batch fermentations ) in laboratory or industrial fermentors, with suitable medium containing physiological-salts and nutrients (See, e.g., Pourquie, J. et al, BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS OF CELLULOSE DEGRADATION, eds. Aubert, J. P. et al., Academic Press, pp. 71-86,1988 and Ilmen, M. et al, (1997) Appl. Environ, Microbiol. 63:1298-1306). Common commercially prepared media (e.g., Yeast Malt Extract (YM) broth, Luria Bertani (LB) broth and Sabouraud Dextrose (SD) broth) find use in the present invention: Preferred culture conditions for a given filamentous fungus are known hi the art and may be found in the scientific literature and/or from the source of the fungi such as the American Type Culture Collection and Fungal Genetics Stock Center. In cases where a glucoamylase coding sequence is under the control of an inducible promoter, the inducing agent (e.g., a sugar, metal salt or antimicrobial), is added to the medium at a concentration effective to induce glucoamylase expression.<br>
hi some embodiments, in order to evaluate the expression of a glucoamylase by a cell line that has been transformed with a polynucleotide encoding a glucoamylase encompassed by the invention, assays are carried out at the protein level, the RNA level and/or by use of functional bioassays particular to glucoamylase activity and/or production. Some of these assays include Northern blotting, dot blotting (DNA or RNA analysis), RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe (based on the nucleic acid coding sequence) and conventional Southern blotting and autoradiography.<br>
hi addition, the production and/or expression of a glucoamylase may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by assays directly measuring reducing sugars such as glucose in the culture medium and by assays for measuring glucoamylase activity, expression and/or production. In particular glucoamylase activity may be assayed by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (See, Goto et al., (1994) Biosci. Biotechnol.<br><br>
Biochem. 58:49 - 54). In additional embodiments, protein expression, is evaluated by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells, tissue sections or immunoassay of tissue culture medium, (e.g., by Western blot or ELISA). Such immunoassays can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate expression of a glucoamylase. The details of such methods are known to those of skill in the art and many reagents for practicing such methods are commercially available.<br>
The glucoamylases of the present invention may be recovered or purified from culture media by a variety of procedures known in the art including centrifugation, filtration extraction, precipitation and the like.<br>
Uses and Compositions<br>
The present invention is also directed to compositions comprising glucoamylases of the invention and methods of using the glucoamylases in industrial and commercial applications. Nonlimiting examples, which include the use of glucoamylases encompassed by the invention in industrial and commercial applications are briefly described below.<br>
The glucoamylases may be used in starch hydrolyzing and saccharifying compositions, cleaning and detergent compositions (e.g., laundry detergents, dish washing detergents, and hard surface cleaning compositions), and hi animal feed compositions. Further the glucoamylases may be used in baking applications, such as bread and cake production, brewing, healthcare, textile, environmental waste conversion processes, biopulp processing, and biomass conversion applications.<br>
In particular, the glucoamylases may be used for starch conversion processes, and particularly in the production of dextrose for fructose syrups, specialty sugars and in alcohol and other end-product (e.g. organic acid, ascorbic acid, and amino acids) production from fermentation of starch containing substrates (G.M.A van Beynum et al., Eds. (1985) STARCH CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY, Marcel Dekker Inc. NY). Dextrins produced using glucoamylase compositions of the invention may result in glucose yields of at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% and at least 95%. Production of alcohol from the fermentation of starch substrates using glucoamylases encompassed by the invention may include the production of fuel alcohol or portable alcohol.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the glucoamylases of the invention will find use hi the hydrolysis of starch from various plant-based substrates, which are used for alcohol<br><br>
production. In some preferred embodiments, the plant-based substrates will include corn, wheat, barley, rye, milo, rice, sugar cane and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the plant-based substrate will be fractionated plant material, for example a cereal grain such as corn, which is fractionated into components such as fiber, germ, protein and starch (endosperm) (USP 6,254,914 and USP 6,899,910). Methods of alcohol fermentations are described in THE ALCOHOL TEXTBOOK, A REFERENCE FOR THE BEVERAGE, FUEL AND INDUSTRIAL ALCOHOL INDUSTRIES, 3rd Ed., Eds K.A. Jacques et al., 1999, Nottingham University Press, UK. In certain preferred embodiments, the alcohol will be ethanol. In particular, alcohol fermentation production processes are characterized as wet milling or dry milling processes. In some embodiments, the glucoamylase will be used in a wet milling fermentation process and in other embodiments the glucoamylase will find use in a dry milling process.<br>
Dry grain milling involves a number of basic steps, which generally include: grinding, cooking, liquefaction, saccharification, fermentation and separation of liquid and solids to produce alcohol and other co-products. Plant material and particularly whole cereal grains, such as corn, wheat or rye are ground. In some cases the grain may be first fractionated into component parts. The ground plant material may be milled to obtain a coarse or fine particle. The ground plant material is mixed with liquid in a slurry tank. The slurry is subjected to high temperatures in a jet cooker along with liquefying enzymes (e.g. alpha amylases) to solubles and hydrolyze the starch in the cereal to dextrins. The mixture is cooled down and further treated with saccharifying enzymes, such as glucoamylases encompassed by the instant invention, to produce glucose. The mash containing glucose is then fermented for approximately 24 to 120 hours in the presence of fermentation microorganisms, such as ethanol producing microorganism and particularly yeast (Saccharomyces spp). The solids in the mash are separated from the liquid phase and alcohol such as ethanol and useful co-products such as distillers' grains are obtained.<br>
In some embodiments, the saccharification step and fermentation step are combined and the process is referred to as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation or simultaneous saccharification, yeast propagation and fermentation.<br>
In other embodiments, the cooking step or exposure of the starch containing substrate to temperatures above the gelatinization temperate of the starch in the substrate may be eliminated. These fermentation processes in some embodiments include milling of<br><br>
a cereal grain or fractionated grain and combining the ground cereal grain with liquid to form a slurry which is then mixed in a single vessel with a glucoamylase according to the invention and optionally other enzymes such as but not limited to alpha amylases, other glucoamylases and enzymes having granular starch hydrolyzing activity and yeast to produce ethanol and other co-products (USP 4,514,496, WO 04/081193 and WO 04/080923).<br>
In some embodiments, the invention pertains to a method of saccharifying a liquid starch solution, which comprises an enzymatic saccharification step using a glucoamylase of the invention.<br>
In some embodiments, an enzyme composition including a glucoamylase encompassed by the invention and obtained in culture media or recovered and purified from the culture medium will be optionally used in combination with any one or combination of the following enzymes - alpha amylases, proteases, pullulanases, isoamylases, cellulases, hernicellulases, xylanases, cyclodextrin glycotransferases, Upases, phytases, laccases, oxidases, esterases, cutinases, xylanases, granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme and other glucoamylases.<br>
In some particularly preferred compositions the glucoamylases of the invention will be combined with alpha amylases, such as fungal alpha amylases (e.g. Aspergillus sp.) or bacterial alpha amylases (e.g. Bacillus sp. such as B. stearothermophilus, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis) and variants thereof. Li some embodiments the alpha amylase will be an alpha amylase having at least 90%, 93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% and 99% sequence identity to the mature protein sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27. Commercially available alpha amylases contemplated for use in the compositions of the invention are known and include GZYME G997, SPEZYME FRED, SPEZYME EHTYL (Genencor International Inc.) and TERMAMYL 120-L and SUPRA (Novozymes, Biotech.).<br>
In other particularly preferred embodiments, the glucoamylases of the invention will be combined with other glucoamylases. In some embodiments, the glucoamylases of the invention will be combined with one or more glucoamylases derived from strains of Aspergillus or variants thereof, such as A. oryzae, A. niger (e.g., the mature protein sequence of Figure 20(A), A. kawachi, and A. awamori', glucoamylases derived from strains of Humicola or variants thereof, particualrly H. grisea, such as the glucoamylase<br><br>
having at least 90%, 93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% and 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3 disclosed in WO 05/052148; glucoamylases derived from strains of Talaromyces or variants thereof, particularly T, emersonir, and glucoamylases derived from strains of Athelia and particularly A. rolfsii.<br>

3) Ethanol and carbohydrate determinations<br>
Ethanol and carbohydrate composition of the samples were determined using the HPLC method as described herein:<br><br>
a)	a 1.5 mL Eppendorf centrifuge tube was filled with fermentor beer and cooled on ice<br>
for 10 min;<br>
b)	the sample tube was centrifuged for 1 min in Eppendorf table top centrifuge;<br>
c)	a 0.5 mL sample of the supernatant was transferred to a test tube containing 0.05 mL of<br>
Kill solution (1.1N H2SO4) and allowed to stand for 5 min;<br>
d)	5.0 mL of water is added to the test tube sample and then filtered into a HPLC vial<br>
through 0.45 um Nylon Syringe Filter; and<br>
e)	run on HPLC.<br>
HPLC conditions:<br>
a)	Ethanol System: Column: Phenomenex Rezex Organic Acid Column (RHM-<br>
Monosaccharide) #OOH 0132-KO (Equivalent to Bio-Rad 87H); Column Temperature:<br>
60Â°C; Mobile Phase: 0.01 N H2SO4; Flow Rate: 0.6 mL/min; Detector: RI; and<br>
Injection Volume: 20ÂµL.  	<br>
b)	Carbohydrate System: Column: Phenomenex Rezex Carbohydrate (RCM-<br>
Monosaccharide) #OOH-0130-KO (Equivalent to Bio-Rad 87H); Column Temperature:<br>
70Â°C ; Mobile Phase: Nanopure DIH2O; Flow Rate: 0.8 mL/min; Detector: RI;<br>
Injection Volume: 10 ÂµL (3% DS material)<br>
The column separates based on the molecular weight of the saccharides, which are designated as DP-1 (monosaccharides); DP-2 (disaccharides); DP-3 (trisaccharides) and DP &gt; 3 (oligosaccharide sugars having a degree of polymerization greater than 3).<br>
4)	Residual starch iodine test: A sample of the beer (fermentation broth) was centrifuged<br>
in 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes. The supernatant was decanted and the tube containing the<br>
pellet was placed in an ice bam. Several drops of 0.025N iodine solution (0.1N iodine<br>
from VWR Cat. No. VW3207-1 diluted 4X) was added to the pellet and mixed. A positive<br>
(+) starch shows a range of color from blue to purple and the intensity of color is directly<br>
proportional to the concentration of starch. A negative result (-) remains yellowish.<br>
5)	Determination of total starch content: The enzyme-enzyme starch liquefaction and<br>
saccharification process (dual enzyme method) was used to determine the total starch<br>
content. In a typical analysis, 2 g of the dry sample was taken in a 100 ml Kohlraucsh flask and 45 ml of MOPS buffer, pH 7.0 was added. The slurry was well stirred for 30 min. SPEZYME FRED (1:50 diluted in water), 1.0 ml was added and heated to boiling for 3-5 min. The flask was placed in an autoclave maintained at 121Â°C for 15 min. After autoclaving the flask was placed in a water bath at 95Â°C and 1 ml of 1:50 dilutes SPEZYME FRED was added and incubated for 45 min. The pH was adjusted to pH 4.2 and the temperature was reduced to 60Â°C. This was followed by addition of 20 ml acetate buffer, pH 4.2. Saccharification was carried out by adding 1.0 ml of 1:100 diluted OPTIDEX L-400 (Glucoamylase from Genencor International Inc.) and the incubation<br>
t<br>
was continued for 18 hr at 60Â°C. The enzyme reaction was terminated by heating at 95Â°C for 10 min. The total sugar composition was determined by HPLC analysis using glucose as a standard. The soluble starch hydrolysate from water extraction of a sample at room temperature without enzymatic treatment was subtracted from the total sugar.<br>
6) Total protein analysis: The total nitrogen (N) in the sample preparations was determined using the Kjeldhal method (American Assoc. Cereal Chemists (AACC), (1983), Methods 22B60 8th Ed. St Paul, MN). Protein content was calculated by 6.25 X total N.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided in order to demonstrate and further illustrate certain preferred embodiments and aspect of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1 - Isolation and Cloning of the TrGA<br>
Chromosomal DNA of Trichoderma reesei QM6a was isolated from mycelial mass of a liquid culture in Potato Dextrose Broth (Difcoâ¢ Cat. No. 254920) using the BIOIOI Fast PrepÂ® System according to the method described by the supplier (Qbiogene). The DNA was purified using a Quick Spin column (Qiagen art No. 28106). The glucoamylase gene was isolated using primers with GA-specific sequences, NSP232R (SEQ ID NO: 24) and NSP233F (SEQ ID NO: 25) designed according to the predicted nucleotide sequence in the Trichoderma reesei genome database of Department of Energy<br>
 (DOE) Joint Genome Institute. The primers were flanked at the 5'-end by Gateway Â® attB sequences (Invitrogen). T. reesei QM6a chromosomal DNA was used as template.<br>
The PCR mix contained the following components: Forward primer (lOÂµM) 4ÂµL; Reverse primer (lOÂµM) 4ÂµL; template DNA (500ng/ÂµL) 1ÂµL; dNTPmix (lOmM) ÂµL; lOx Cx buffer 10ÂµL and PfuTurboÂ® Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase 0.5ÂµL (Stratagen Cat. No. 600410). Deionized water was added up to a total volume of lOOÂµL.<br>
The PCR protocol was as follows: Initial denaturation for 30 sec. at 98Â°C, denaturation /annealing and extension in 30 cycles of 10 sec at 98Â°C; 30 sec at 68Â°C; 45 sec at 72Â°C , respectively, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72Â°C.<br>
The PCR fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis hi 1% agarose. Fragments of the expected size were isolated using the Gel-Extraction Purification Kit (Qiagene Cat. no. 28706). The PCR fragments were cloned into the Gateway Â® Entry vector pDONR201 and transformed into E.coli DH5alpha Max Efficiency cells (Invitrogen Cat.No. 18258012). The nucleotide sequence of the inserted DNA was determined, from which the genomic DNA sequence of the TrGA gene was deduced (Fig. 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1)).<br>
Example 2 - Transformation of T. reesei and Fermentation/ Expression of the TrGA<br>
Vector DNA containing the correct GA gene sequence was recombined into the T. reesei expression vector pTrex3g (Fig. 17).<br>
The vector pTrex3g is based on the E. coli vector pSLl 180 (Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, NJ) which is a pUCl 18 phagemid based vector (Brosius, J. (1989), DNA 8:759) with an extended multiple cloning site containing 64 hexamer restriction enzyme recognition sequences. It was designed as a Gateway destination vector (Hartley et al., (2000) Genome Research 10:1788 -1795) to allow insertion using Gateway technology (Invitrogen) of any desired open reading frame between the promoter and terminator regions of the" T. reesei cbhl gene. It also contains the Aspergillus nidulans amdS gene for use as a selective marker hi transformation of T. reesei. The details of the pTrex3g vector are as follows (Figure 17A). The vector is 10.3 kb hi size. Inserted into the polylinker region of pSLl 180 are the following segments of DNA: a) A 2.2 bp segment of DNA from the promoter region of the T. reesei cbhl gene; b) the 1.7 kb Gateway reading frame A cassette acquired from Invitrogen that includes the attRl and attR2 recombination sites<br>
at either end flanking the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CmR) and the ccdB gene; c) a 336 bp segment of DNA from the terminator region of the T. reesei cbhl gene; and d) a 2.7kb fragment of DNA containing the Aspergillus nidulans cundS gene with its native promoter and terminator regions.<br>
The expression vector containing the T. reesei GA gene, pNSP23 (Fig. 17) was transformed into a T. reesei host strain derived from RL-P37 (IA52) and having various gene deletions (â cbhl, âcbh2, âegl, âeg2) using particle bombardment by the PDS-1000/Helium System (BioRad Cat. No. 165-02257). The protocol is outlined below, and reference is also made to examples 6 and 11 of WO 05/001036.<br>
A suspension of spores (approximately 5 xlO spores/ml) from a quad deleted strain of T. reesei was prepared. 100 ul â 200 ul of spore suspension was spread onto the center of plates of Minimal Medium (MM) acetamide medium. (MM acetamide medium had the following compositions: 0.6 g/L acetamide; 1.68 g/LCsCl; 20 g/L glucose; 20 g/L KH2PO4; 0.6 g/L CaCl2 2H2O; 1 ml/L 1000X trace elements solution; 20 g/L Noble agar; and pH 5.5. 1000X trace elements solution contained 5.0 g/L FeSO4 7H2O; 1.6 g/L MnSO4; 1.4 g/L ZnSO4 7H2O and 1.0 g/L CoCl2 6H2O. The spore suspension was allowed to dry on the surface of the MM acetamide medium.<br>
Transformation followed the manufacturers instruction. Briefly, 60 mg of M10 tungsten particles were placed in a microcentrifuge tube. 1 mL of ethanol was added and allowed to stand for 15 seconds. The particles were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 seconds. The ethanol was removed and die particles were washed three times with sterile dH2O before 250 uL of 50% (v/v) sterile glycerol was added. 25 ul of tungsten particle suspension was placed into a microtrifuge tube. While continuously vortexing, the following were added: 5 ul (100 - 200 ng/ul) of plasmid DNA, 25 ul of 2.5M CaCl2 and 10 ul of 0.1M spermidine. The particles were centrifuged for 3 seconds. The supernatant was removed and the particles were washed with 200 ul of 100% ethanol and centrifuged for 3 seconds. The supernatant was removed, 24 uL 100% ethanol was added and mixed by pipetting, then 8 ul aliquots of particles were removed and placed onto the center of macrocarrier disks that were held in a desiccator. Once the tungsten/DNA solution had dried the macrocarrier disk was placed in the bombardment chamber along with the plate of MM acetamide with spores and the bombardment process was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. After bombardment of the plated spores with the<br>
tungsten/DNA particles, the plates were incubated at 30Â°C. Transformed colonies were transferred to fresh plates of MM acetamide medium and incubated at 30Â°C.<br>
Example 3 - Demonstration of GA activity from the expressed TrGA in transformed cells<br>
After 5 days of growth on MM acetamide plates transformants displaying stable morphology were inoculated into 250 ml shake flasks containing 30 ml of Proflo medium. (Proflo medium contained: 30 g/L a-lactose; 6.5 g/L (NHLOaSO4; 2 g/L KH2PO4; 0.3 g/L MgSO4 7H2O; 0.2 g/L CaCl2; 1 ml/L 1000X trace element salt solution; 2 ml/L 10% Tween 80; 22.5 g/L ProFlo cottonseed flour (Traders protein, Memphis, TN); 0.72 g/L CaCO3.   After two days growth at 28 C and 140rpm, 10% of the Proflo culture was transferred to a 250 ml shake flask containing 30 ml of Lactose Defined Media. The composition of the Lactose defined Media was as follows 5 g/L (NILOaSO4; 33 g/L PIPPS buffers; 9 g/L casamino acids; 4.5 g/L KH2PO4; 1.0 g/L MgSO4 7H2O; 5 ml/L Mazu DF60-P antifoam (Mazur Chemicals, IL); 1000X trace element solution; pH 5.5; 40 ml/L of 40% (w/v) lactose solution was added to the medium after sterilization. The Lactose Defined medium shake flasks were incubated at 28Â°C, 140 rpm for 4 â 5 days.<br>
Mycelium was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was analyzed for total protein (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Cat. No. 23225) and GA activity using pNPG as substrate (Sigma N-1377).<br>
Samples of the culture supernatant were mixed with appropriate volume of 2X sample laoding buffer with reducing agent and the protein profile was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using NuPAGEÂ® Novex 10% Bis-Tris Gel with MES SDS Running Buffer. The gels were stained with SimplyBlueâ¢ SafeStain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).<br>
On SDS-PAGE analysis a protein band that was not observed in supernatant from a quad delete strain was observed in the supernatant of some transformants with the pTrexSg vector containing the glucoamylase open reading frame (Figure 16). This new protein band had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 64 kDa. This result confirms that TrGA is secreted into the medium.<br><br>
Example 4 - Biochemical characterization of the GA gene product GA producing transformants were grown at 4-L scale. The culture filtrate was concentrated using an ultra filtration unit with a nominal molecular weight limit of 10,000 Da (Pall Omega Centramate OSOlOclO). The crude enzyme preparation was purified by a 2-step procedure using an AKTA explorer 100 FPLC System (Amersham Biosciences). A HiPrep 16/10 FF Q-Sepharose column (Amersham BioSciences Cat. No. 17-5190-01) was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris pH 8.0 and the protein was eluted from the column with 100 mM NaCl in 25 mM Tris pH 8.0. A second affinity chromatography step was performed using Cbind 200 resin (Novagen Cat. No. 701212-3) and 50 mM Tris pH 7.0 containing 500 mM NaCl as elution buffer (Fig. 16). The N-terminus of the gene product (Ser-Val-Asp-Asp-Phe-De) (SEQ ID NO: 38) was determined by Edman degradation (Edman, P. (1956) Acta Chem Scand 10:761-768).<br>
The pH and temperature profiles of the glucoamylase activity of the gene product were determined using 4-nitrophenyl-a-D-glucopyranoside as substrate (Elder, M. T. and Montgomery R. S., Glucoamylase activity in industrial enzyme preparations using colorimetric enzymatic method; Collaborative study Journal of AOAC International, vol. 78(2), 1995) (Fig. 18).<br>
Example 5 - Isolation /cloning of glucoamvlase homologs from strains in the Trichoderma/Hypocrea family cluster<br>

Full-length GA genes were cloned as described hi example 1 using the TrGA-gene specific primers NSP231F (SEQ ID NO: 23) and NSP232R (SEQ ID NO: 24). The nucleotide sequences of the strains are disclosed in Fig. 4 for GA102 (SEQ ID NO: 5); Fig. 5 for GA104 (SEQ ID NO: 7); Fig. 6 for GA105 (SEQ ID NO: 9); Fig. 7 for GA107 (SEQ ID NO: 11); Fig. 8 for GA108 (SEQ ID NO: 13); Fig. 9 for GA109 (SEQ ID NO: 15); Fig. 10 for GA113 (SEQ ID NO: 28); Fig. 11 for GA103 (SEQ ID NO: 30); Fig. 12 for GA124 (SEQ ID NO: 32); Fig. 13 for GA127 (SEQ ID NO: 34) and Fig. 14 for GA128 (SEQ ID NO: 36). The corresponding amino acid sequences are illustrated in Fig. 15.

Example 6 - Glucose Production Using TrGA<br>
A 32% DS slurry of Cargill bag starch was made up with reverse osmosis water. The pH of the slurry was adjusted to pH 5.8. The slurry was filtered through a 100-mesh screen and dosed at 4.0 AAU/g ds using SPEZYMEÂ® ETHYL, (Genencor International, Inc.). The slurry was then jetted at 107.3Â°C for 5 min (primary liquefaction). Enzyme activity is determined by the rate of starch hydrolysis, as reflected in the rate of decrease in iodine-staining capacity. One AAU unit of bacterial alpha amylase activity is the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 10 mg of starch per minute under specified conditions. After primary liquefaction, the liquefact was collected and placed in a 95Â°C water bath for 120 min (Secondary liquefaction). Samples were taken at 30,60,90 and 120 min and checked for DE by using the standard Schoorls reducing sugar method from the Corn Refiners Association. The liquefact was aliquoted in 100-g quantities into screw cap jars, the pH was adjusted to pH 4.5 and equilibrated to 60Â°C for 15 minutes prior to dosing. The TrGA enzyme was diluted so as to add 0.2 rnls of diluted enzyme to the jar at 0.22 GAU/g ds. After dosing, the liquefact was aliquoted into 7 screw cap tubes, each containing approximately 10 mis of material and returned to the designated temperature. Tubes were removed at selected time intervals (18,24,30,42, 50 and 55 hours) and analyzed by HPLC Carbohydrate System: Column: Phenomenex Rezex Carbohydrate (RCM- Monosaccharide) #OOH-0130-KO (Equivalent to Bio-Rad 87H); Column<br><br>

Example 7 - Ethanol Production using TrGA in a Simultaneous Saccharification and<br>
Fermentation (SSF) Process<br>
A sample of corn mash liquefact from a local ethanol producer was obtained and diluted to 29% DS using thin stillage. The pH of the slurry was adjusted to pH 4.3 using 6 N sulphuric acid. A 300 g aliquot of the mash was placed into a 31Â°C water bath and allowed to equilibrate. TrGA was added to the sample (0.4 GAU/g ds, which is equal to 1.08 kg/MT ds). After enzyme addition, 1 ml of a 15 g in 45 ml DI water solution of Red Star Red yeast (Lesaffre yeast Corp. Milwaukee, WI) was added to each sample. Samples were taken at 18,26,41 and 53 hours and analyzed by HPLC Column: Phenomenex Rezex organic Acid Column (RHM- Monosaccharide) #OOH-0132-KO (Equivalent to Bio-Rad 87H); Column Temperature: 60Â°C; Mobile Phase: 0.01 NH2SO4; Flow Rate: 0.6 mL/min; Detector: RI; Injection Volumn: 20uL.<br>

Example 8 - A Non-cook Process for Ethanol Production using TrGA. In general a 33% slurry of corn flour (Azure Standard Farms) was prepared in DI to which 400 ppm urea was added. The pH was adjusted to 4.5. Fermentations were conducted in 125 ml flasks containing lOOg mash and various treatments of GAU/g TrGA. A 20% slurry of Fali dry yeast in water was prepared and mixed with a 32Â°C water bath one hour prior to inoculating the fermenters by adding 0.2 ml of the yeast slurry. The flasks were placed in a 32 Â°C water bath and the mash mix gently. During the fermentations samples were icmoved for HPLC analysis. The fermentations were terminated after 72 hours. Production of compounds including sugars, lactic acid, glycerol and ethanol at various sampling intervals is shown below in various tables. The mash was dried at 60Â°C to obtain the DDGS, and the starch content of the DDGS was determined by the dual enzyme method.<br>
A.       All conditions were as described above: the treatment included 1.2 GAU/g TrGA.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
C.        All conditions were as described above: the treatments included a) A. niger GA 0.75 GAU/g + 2.25 SSU AkAA and b) TrGA 0.75 GAU/g + 2.25 SSU AkAA. The residua] starch for AnGA + AkAA treatment was determined to be 5.26% and the residual starch for TrGA + AkAA treatment was determined to be 8.71%.<br>
The measurement of alpha amylase activity for AkAA is based on the degree of hydrolysis of soluble potato starch substrate (4% ds) by an aliquot of the enzyme sample at pH 4.5, 50Â°C. The reducing sugar content is measured using the DNS method as described in Miller, G. L. (1959) Anal. Chem. 31:426 - 428. One unit of the enzyme activity (SSU, soluble starch unit) is equivalent to the reducing power of 1mg of glucose released per minute at the specific incubation conditions.<br><br>
