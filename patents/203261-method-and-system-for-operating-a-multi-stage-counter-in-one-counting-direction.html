DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for operating a multistage counter in one counting direction.<br>
Nowadays there are very many fields of application in which the counting of events is to take place. These events can be the frequency of use of an appliance, the passing of persons or vehicles or objects, the registration of a telephone counting cycle, but also the registration of a driving performance, be it an odometer in an automobile or an operating hours counter in any desired appliance and, not least, the registered working time or attendance time of an employee at his workplace. All these cases are characterized by the fact that they are registered with the highest possible accuracy, that is to say as a rule a high value range of counter readings is covered. In addition, in the aforementioned cases, there is generally the desire for the counter result not to be open to manipulation, that is to say it cannot be reset. A requirement of this case may be met reliably by a single - stage counter which can count only upward or downward from its previous counter reading. This may be implemented simply, for example by means of an EEPROM, it then being necessary for there to be one EEPROM cell for each counter reading, and for the EEPROM to be capable of being only written or erased, depending on whether upward or downward counting is provided.<br>
For the first requirement, namely that the greatest possible value range is to be registered by the counter, then leads to the result that, in the case of such an implementation , an EEPROM memory with appropriately many storage cells has<br><br>
2<br>
to be provided. Expressed in numerical terms, this means that, for example in order to achieve a maximum counter reading of 255, exactly 255 counter cells are needed. However, it is nowadays usual to construct arrangements of this type to be as small as possible. The use of a multistage counter with 8 bits, that is to say 8 counter cells, likewise leads to a maximum counter reading of 255. A multistage counter of this type (8 - bit binary counter) has the drawback, however, that when there is a change in the next counter digit, the preceding counter digit is reset. This leads to the situation where the implementation of a multistage counter which counts only in one direction and at the same time is not open to manipulation can be realized only with great difficulty.<br>
EP 0 321 727 describes a circuit arrangement in which a number of EEPROM cells are arranged in a row. In this case, a number or rows are in turn connected together. The storage cells of one row in each case constitute a uniform value level, it being possible for the stored contents of one row to be erased by a logical monitoring means only when an overflow into the next higher row has taken place. The arrangement disclosed in this printed specification exhibits precisely the drawbacks previously explained of being open to manipulation, in that unidirectional counting is not insured with certainty by exerting an influence on the logic circuit. A similar but somewhat more complicated arrangement is explained in EP 0 618 591, an auxiliary storage cell being provided for rewriting each next higher row, being capable of being programmed and also erased again, but this arrangement can also be manipulated easily, since the auxiliary storage cells can be both written and erased.<br><br>
3<br>
JP 02 090726A describes an arrangement for measuring a signal A, using two counters 4 and 6. The periodic signal A is fed to both of the counters, in each case via a gate 1 and 2. It is possible to assume that the counters are not those which count in only one direction, but can atleast be reset. Since this is a measuring arrangement, in this case the respective opening time of the two is different by 1/N. The counter result of the counter 4 is indicated by flashing until the ratio between the two counter results is likewise 1/N. The result of the counter 4 is then indicated continuously. As a result, the counter results from the two counters do not depend on each other but on the frequency of the signal A and the ratio of the opening times of the two gates 1 and 2.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of providing a method and a circuit arrangement for operating a multistage counter in which security against manipulation is increased.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by the features specified in patent claims 1 and 4, respectively.<br>
By means of the simultaneous operation of a single - stage counter which counts only either upward or downward, in addition to the multistage counter, which counts the actual event, a comparison is used to insure that the counter reading of the multistage counter agrees with the counter reading of the single - stage counter, atleast in terms of order of magnitude. The possibility of manipulation is therefore eliminated with simple means. If agreement, with a predefined ratio between the two counters, is not provided, then the indicator signal according to claim 2 indicates the lack of reliability, a check being made to see whether the<br><br>
4<br>
counter reading of the single - stage counter is in a predetermined relationship with the counter reading of the multistage counter. According to patent claim 3, reliability is provided when the counter readings agree.<br>
In the following text, the invention will be described with reference to the figure, an exemplary embodiment being illustrated in the form of a block diagram.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrated in the figure has an m - stage counter with m = 8. In the illustration, this is to be understood as an 8 - bit binary counter. The counter 11 is therefore able to count from 0 to 255, that is to say 256 counting digits. The counter 11 is connected to a control unit 3, which feeds the counter 11 with a counting signal Sll. Each time the counting signal S11 is fed, the counter 11 is changed by 1, the change taking place in the same direction as a preceding change. This means that the counter illustrated symbolically in the figure is configured in such a way that it counts either upward or only downward. The respective counter reading of the multistage counter 11 is fed as a counter - reading signal 211 to test logic 4. Also provided is a single -stage counter 1 which, in this exemplary embodiment, has n cells with n = 16. This counter, illustrated symbolically in the figure, is intended to be constructed in such a way that it also counts only in one counting direction, namely from 0 to 15, that is to say 16 counting digits. The single - stage counter 1 receives a counting signal S1 from the control unit 3, on receipt of which it is incremented by one counting value. The counter reading of the single - stage counter 1 is fed to the control unit 3 as a monitoring counter - reading signal Zl, and therefore<br><br>
5<br>
to the test logic 4. The test logic 4 compares the counter - reading signal Z11 with the monitoring counter - reading signal Z1 and outputs a signal determined on the basis of the comparison to a counter controller 5. The counter controller 5 in turn outputs an error signal F on the basis of the test signal P received from the test logic 4.<br>
The two counters 11 and 1 can be constructed, for example, as EEPROM cells. In this case, provision is made for the individual storage cell to be written or erased in accordance with the rules of upward or downward counting, corresponding to the known operation of a binary counter. In the same way, the single - stage monitoring counter 1 is also composed of EEPROM cells, it being possible for the individual cells 1 to n only to be written or erased one after another.<br>
The typical operation of the arrangement illustrated in the figure will now be described. In principle, provision is made for a counting signal S11 to be output by the control unit 3 in response to each input signal E. In this case, the test logic 4 has previously checked the counter readings of the two counters 1 and 11 by means of the counter - reading signal Z11 and the monitoring counter -reading signal Zl. If both are 0, for example, the test logic 4 determines that there is agreement and, by means of the test signal P, permits the counter controller 5 to output the counting signal SF.<br>
Provision is now made for both counters to count from 0 to 255. This means that at each sixteenth counting signal Sll which goes to the multistage counter 11, the single - stage monitoring counter 1 likewise receives a monitoring counting signal SI from the counter controller 5 in the control unit 3. For non -manipulated operation, the test logic is then designed in such a way that it<br><br>
6<br>
monitors the fact that the counter reading of the counter 11 matches the counter reading just reached by the monitoring counter 1. This means that, in the case of the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the counter reading of the counter 1 i must not be less than (i x 16) - 1. This is correspondingly true for an arrangement which counts downwards; here, too, the counter 11 must be located in a range which matches the counter reading of the monitoring counter 1, in accordance with the counting logic.<br>
As soon as the test logic 4 determines that there is no agreement, an error signal F is output.<br>
However, the invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in the figure. Instead, it is also possible to imagine that, in particular in the case of a very large counter - reading range of the counter 11 which is to be exceeded, in order to save counter cells in the single - stage counter, the latter is not operated linearly but, for example, in decades. This means that the single - stage counter would receive a monitoring counting signal S1 from the counter controller 5, for example, at each 10th, 100th, 1000th counting signal S11, and so on. In order to monitor the non - manipulated operation, the test logic 4 must be constructed accordingly, that is to say in such a case the counter reading of the counter 11 must correspond to the order of magnitude associated with the respective counter reading of the monitoring counter 1. It is equally well possible to imagine that the relationship between the counter reading of the counter 11 and the counter reading of the monitoring counter 1 corresponds to a logarithmic, exponential or any other suitable and desired function. This can then be applied both to counter arrangements which count upward and to those which count downward.<br><br>
7<br>
In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the counter 11 and the monitoring counter 1 do not necessarily have to count in the same direction. Instead, provision can also be made for the one counter to count upward and for the respective other counter to count downward. The sole precondition for non -manipulated operation is that the monitoring counter counts in only one direction and the test logic 4 is constructed in such a way that the counter reading of the counter 11 has a logical relationship with the counter reading of the monitoring counter 1.<br><br>
