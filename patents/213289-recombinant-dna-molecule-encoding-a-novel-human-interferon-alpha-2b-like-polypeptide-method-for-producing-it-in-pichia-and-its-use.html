				<td>The present invention describes a novel DNA encoding human IFN alpha 2b like protein and its method of preparation for therapeutic uses. The process also involves novel oligonucleotides used as primers while isolating the novel gene. The appopriate gene after isolation is inserted into plasmid, which is further propagated in bacteria and later in yeast to give transformants having gene encoding for recombinant human IFN alpha 2b like protein. The preferred cells for production of proteins for commercial use are methylotropic yeast. Using a new fermentation process, high-density cell culture of recombinant yeast is prepared bu maintaining appropriate fermentation parameters. Later recombinant yeast cells are induced to produce desired protein in high yields. The said protein is purified by a novel purification process. The said purified protein is found to have interferon like activity, when evaluated by invito assay and has all physiological, immunological and biochemical characteristics similar to mature human interferon alpha 2b protein.</td>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION-10)<br>
COTTON STALK COMPACTING MACHINE,<br>
CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON COTTON TECHNOLOGY, INDIAN COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, ADENW ALA ROAD, MATUNGA,<br>
MUMBAI-400 019 GOVT OF INDIA<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner  in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
TECHANICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a compacting machine, more particularly compacting machine for cotton stalk<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Cotton, the king of natural fibers is mainly cultivated for its lint which is the most sought after textile fiber till date due to its inherent ecofriendly and comfort characteristics. It is also one of the important cash crops of many of the Afro-Asian countries like India, Iran, Egypt, Sudan,Uzbekistan, Tanzania, etc. and plays a major role in their economic development. However, of late, cotton cultivation in general and especially in these countries is becoming non-remunerative on account of higher cost of inputs by way of plant protection measures, low productivity in rain fed cultivation, etc. As a result, the cultivators are not able to get adequate returns commensurate with their inputs. Hence, there is an urgent need to explore alternative means of increasing the returns from cotton farming. While efficient use of available resources, good quality seeds,organic cultivation, transgenic cotton etc. could reduce the cost of cultivation and enhance productivity, a judicious approach to promote the use of byÂ¬products from cotton cultivation through value addition route offers an attractive proposition to generate additional income to the farming community. At the same time, cotton stalks being a renewable and naturally available lignocellulosic material, its promotion as a substitute for forest timber is likely to have significant impact in arresting the environmental degradation caused by the fast depletion of<br>
forest resources in developing countries. Utilisation of Cotton Plant Stalks<br>
Cotton is one of the important cash crops popularly know as "White Gold".In India, all the four cultivated species, viz., G. arboreum, G. herbaceum. G. hirsutum and G. barbadense are grown on a commercial scale apart from hybrids. The current total area under cotton cultivation<br>
2<br><br>
during  2003-04 was about 7.6 million hectares with the production of around 16.8 million bales of 170 kg each.<br>
In India cotton is cultivated during the period July to December and the crop is harvested from January to March. Following table gives information about the area and production of cotton and availability of stalks in various parts of the country.<br>
Table 1: Area Under Cultivation, Production of Indian Cotton &amp; Availability of Cotton Stalks (State-wise) 2002-2003 <br><br>

2.  Gujarat	1.498	3.050	4.49<br>
3. Haryana	0.535	0.85	1.61<br>
4. Karnataka	0.362	0.600	1.09<br>
5.  Madhya Pradesh	0.55	1.800	1.65<br>
6.  Maharashtra	2.800	2.400	8.40<br>
7.  Punjab	0.425	0.800	1.28<br>
8. Rajasthan	0.335	0.450	1.01<br>
9.  Tamil Nadu	0.115	0.400	0.35<br>
10. Others	0.053	0.100	0.16<br>
Total	7.573	12.45	22.74<br>
.CAB estimate excluding loose cotton of 1.15 million bales<br>
The yield of biomass varies from species to species, it is highest in the case of hybrids and lowest in the case of G. arboreum species. However, on an average about 3 tonnes of cotton<br>
plant stalks are available in one hectare of land. Depending upon the<br>
3<br><br>
variety and the crop condition the sticks are 1 to 1.75 meter long and their diameter just above the ground may vary from 1 to 2.5 cm. The specific weight of short chopped stick is about 160 kg/m3. The calorific value of cotton stalks is equivalent to poor quality wood and is about 17.40 (MJ/kg). About 23 million tonnes of cotton stalks are generated in India with an average production of 3 tonnes per hectare of land.<br>
Most of the stalk produced is treated as waste though a small part of it is used as domestic fuel. The bulk of the stalk is burnt off in the fields after the harvest of cotton crop. On an average cotton plant stalk contains about 68 % holocellulose, 26% lignin and 7% ash.<br>
It is interesting to note that in contrast to other agricultural crop residues, cotton stalks possess fibre dimension comparable to most commonly available species of hardwood.<br>
It can therefore be used for the manufacture of particle boards, preparation of pulp and paper, hard board, corrugated boards and boxes, as a source of cellulose for the manufacture of micro-crystalline cellulose and cellulose derivatives, etc. Cotton stalks can also be used to grow edible oyster mushrooms.<br>
Presently, boards are mainly made from wood particles. The increase in demand for sawn wood and panel materials in the country cannot be met from the existing forest resources. The regeneration of forest takes considerable time and therefore it is unlikely that timber alone can serve as the raw material required by the wood product industries.<br>
Cotton stalk is light, bulky and occupies more space. In order to enthuse prospective entrepreneurs to use cotton plant stalks in addition to already available biomass viz., bagasse, a knowledge on logistics of collection, methodology for compaction and transportation becomes very important. Presently, in India no particle board or binderless board factory is using cotton stalks for the simple reason that no agency has taken up on a<br>
4<br><br>
systematised way to collect, compact and transport cotton stalks to the factory gate. In this direction an effort has been made in Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology to collect stalks, compact them and<br>
transport the compacted bales to a factory where chipping facility is there or chip them in a decentralised place and then transport to the factory. It has already been observed that baled cotton stalks produce uniform chips in view of near parellelisation of stalks during compacting.<br>
A number of baling machines for bagasse, straw, cattle feed etc. are available in the market all of which mostly work on hydraulic principle in which case some times bale breakers are needed before using them as raw materials.<br>
The aim of compacting cotton stalks is to reduce its volume, increase the bulk density by retaining the original structure and near parellelising the branchy nature of the plant. This enables transportation of more material in unit space and aids in obtaining uniform chips when fed to chippers of appropriate type.<br>
The present invention describes the engineering details of a Compacting Machine for Cotton Stalks by using a Hydraulic System and its functioning.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to compact the stalk of cotton in very reliable and economical way by this machine.<br>
