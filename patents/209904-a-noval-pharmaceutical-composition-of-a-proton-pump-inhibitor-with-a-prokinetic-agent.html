GRANTED<br>

A Novell Pharmaceutical Composition of a Proton Pump Inhibitor with a Prokinetic Agent<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), reflux oesophagitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer and other gastric acid related disorders are disorders having a pathogenesis related to reduced gastric motility, i.e., reduced clearing capacity of the stomach, and release of excessive gastric acid. Aside from behavioral changes, GERD and gastric ulcer have been successfully treated with a range of gastric acid inhibitors, such as ranitidine and omeprazole, which are known as H2 blocker or acid-suppressing drugs. Stimulation of gastric motility has been proposed to accelerate the healing of gastric ulcer. Prokinetic drugs, such as cisapride, are known to enhance gastrointestinal motility and prevent duodenogastric reflux, and are widely used to treat GERD. Ranitidine and prokinetic drugs have been used in combination to treat gastric ulcer and other related disorders.<br>
(2)	H2 receptor antagonists are widely prescribed for GERD. Their higher cost has been compensated by the clinical results obtained both in terms of symptom relief and healing. These advantages have been related to their mode of action, which offered more potent and longer duration of effect on gastric acidity.<br>
(3)	Pyridin-2-ylmethylsulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles, as disclosed, for example, in EP-A 0005129, EP-A 0166287 and EP-A 0268956 are becoming increasingly important,<br><br>
because of their H /K ATPase-inhibiting action, for the therapy of diseases which originate from increased gastric acid secretion. The present invention comprises of proton pump inhibitor is rabeprazole sodium. The rabeprazole sodium and or its other salts here after will be termed as "rabeprazole".<br>
(4)	Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, which rapidly takes share from H2 receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis and healing and prevention of relapse for reflux oesophagitis.<br>
(5)	The US patent 6,132,771 discloses oral pharmaceutical composition comprising of a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor claimed is omeprazole and its salts and prokinetic agent is Mosapride or Cisapride, the dosage form is multiple unit tablet dosage form, multilayered tablets or capsules filled with more than one pharmaceutically active compounds in a conventional dosage form. The dose of proton pump inhibitor mentioned herein is Omeprazole and its dose is 10/20 nig once a day and a prokinetic agent Mosapride is to be given 5 mg thrice a day. Hence comprising the two will lead to a problem of dose adjustment and frequency.<br>
Our patent discloses once a day dosage form containing proton pump inhibitor Rabeprazole 10/20 mg with Mosapride 15 mg SR, which eliminates the problem of dose adjustment and frequency.<br>
(6)	The prokinetic agents in the present invention, mosapride citrate dihydate is equivalent to mosapride citrate and or its salts here after will be termed as "mosapride" in this application are a benzamide-type gastroprokinetic agent that enhances the gastrointestinal motility by stimulating the 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT4) receptor.<br>
(7)	A combination therapy comprising an acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. An acid suppressing agent plus a prokinetic agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutic tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that<br><br>
patient compliance is a main factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablet with blend/ granule in a capsule.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
(8)	The present invention comprises co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole and a prokinetic agent, mosapride in a single unit formulation, wherein the proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic agents are formulated and presented in a manner to minimize interaction of rabeprazole with mosapride a single unit dosage form to deliver a enteric coated proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole along with the immediate release and or sustained/controlled/floating gastroretentive sustained or controlled release prokinetic agent Mosapride for once a day administration.<br>
(9)	It is well known that some of the gastric acid suppressing agents, such as proton pump inhibitors are susceptible to degradation/transformation in acid reacting and neutral media. In respect of the stability properties, it is obvious that the one of the active substances being an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor must be protected from contact with acidic gastric juice by an enteric coating layer.<br><br>
(9)	There are problems to produce a fixed unit dosage form comprising a rather high amount of active substance. Different active substances with differing physical properties in the same preparation give further problems. In order to obtain a pharmaceutical dosage form of rabeprazole, which prevents it from contact with the mosapride and acidic gastric juice, the rabeprazole must be enteric coated or delayed release.<br>
(10)	In order to enhance the storage stability of the enteric coated tablet of rabeprazole , the cores of the tablet must also contain alkalizing agent. When such an alkaline core is enteric coated with an amount of a conventional enteric coating polymer such as, for example, cellulose acetate phthalate, that permits the dissolution of the coating and the active drug contained in the cores in the proximal part of the small intestine, it also will allow some diffusion of water of gastric juice through the enteric coating into the cores, during the time the dosage form resides in the stomach before it is emptied into the small intestine. The diffused water of gastric juice will dissolve parts of the core in the close proximity of the enteric coating layer and there form an alkaline solution inside the<br><br><br>
coated dosage form. The alkaline nature of core will interfere with the enteric coating and eventually dissolve it. The 3-4% of the seal coat of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose is done in order to prevent the incompatibility of the alkaline nature of the core with the enteric coating.<br>
(011) The present invention contains a single unit dosage form of a capsule which contains two parts (tablet and blend/granules in a capsule), first part comprises of a proton pump inhibitor Rabeprazole with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and alkalizing agent compressed in tablet and it is enteric coated and second part comprises of the blend and or granules of a prokinetic agent, mosapride with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in a single unit formulation. Rabeprazole enteric-coated tablet formulation comprises alkaline excipients. Rabeprazole, was coated with L-Arginine and / or Sodium Hydroxide dissolved in minimum amount of water and the blend was air dried to remove the solvent and dried till all solvent was evaporated Mannitol, sodium carbonate anhydrous, Light Magnesium Carbonate Crospovidone, sodium lauryl sulphate were sieved through 60 mesh and blended for 5 minutes. HPMC E06 and /or HPC were dissolved in purified water to make 10 % w/v solution and the above blend was granulated. The granules were wet passed through mesh no. 8, air dried and then dried at 40° C till the loss on drying (LOD) of desired value reached of NMT 3.0 % (Make: Mettler Toledo LJ16 moisture analyzer) at 70' C. The dried granules were sieved through 20# Sieve. Finally Crospovidone, Magnesium Stearate, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Colloidal Silicon dioxide (passed through 60 mesh) were added and the whole mixture blended for 5 minutes. The tablets were compressed on 16-station compression machine (Make: Cadmach). The hardness of tablets found to be 3-5 kg/cm2. Mosapride sustained release tablet comprises Mosapride citrate dihydrate, Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (Methocel K 100 M Premium), Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (E15 cps) and Microcrystalline cellulose sieved through 60 mesh and blended for 5 minutes. Povidone (PVPK-30) was dissolved in Isopropyl Alcohol (5 % w/v) and the above blend was granulated. The granules were passed from mesh no. 8, air dried and then dried at 40° C till the loss on drying (LOD) of desired value reached of NMT 2.5 % (Make: Mettler Toledo LJ16 moisture analyzer) at 105° C. The dried granules<br><br><br>
were sieved through 20 mesh. Finally magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide (passed through 60 no. mesh) were added and the whole mixture blended for 5 minutes. The tablets were compressed on 16 station compression machine (Make: Cadmach). The hardness of tablets found to be 3-5 kg/cm2. Mosapride immediate release blend part comprises Mosapride citrate dihydrate, Lactose DC 11 and Avicel pH 200 sieved through 60 no. mesh and blended for 5 minutes. Talc and magnesium stearate (passed through 60 no. mesh) were added and the whole mixture blended for 5 minutes. The capsules were filled with Rabeprazole enteric-coated tablet, mosapride sustained release tablet and mosapride immediate release blend. The whole procedure was carried out in controlled conditions of temperature (25 °C ±2°C), relative humidity (40%±5% RH) and protected from direct exposure to light.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
(12)	Following description contains many examples, these should not be construed as limitation in the scope of invention, but rather as an exemplification of the prepared embodiments thereof, many other modifications can be possible. Rabeprazole Sodium is a proton pump inhibitor, which rapidly takes share from H2 receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis and healing and prevention of relapse for reflux oesophagitis. The prokinetic agents in the present invention, mosapride citrate dihydate is equivalent to mosapride citrate and or its salts here after will be termed as "mosapride" in this application. They are a benzamide-type gastroprokinetic agent that enhances the gastrointestinal motility by stimulating the 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT4) receptor.<br>
(13)	A combination therapy comprising an acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. An acid suppressing agent plus a prokinetic agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutic tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that patient compliance is a main factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablet and blend/ granule in a capsule for once a day dosing.<br>
(14)	The compatibility (physical and chemical) study was done taking suitable ratio of Mosapride citrate dihydrate and Rabeprazole sodium with the individual excipients and the combination drugs. The sample mixtures were blended and triturated gently in glass mortar and pestle and these were filled in glass vials and sealed with high viscosity polyethylene closures. Few pinholes were made on the cap for maintaining the relative humidity and the vials were placed on 40° C ± 2° C / 75 % ± 5% RH. Samples were analyzed on differential scanning calorimeter and visually for initially, and at the interval of 15 days for one month. The results were compared to check the compatibility (physical and chemical) of the drug with excipients. It was found that the vials containing drug and<br><br><br>
excipients blend triturate were satisfactory in appearance as compared to individual control samples.<br>
(015)	In order to screen for formulation stability we have formulated five different types<br>
of process for the formulation. The analysis of Rabeprazole part was done by HPLC<br>
(Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 250 mm, Symmetry Cis, 5 column using<br>
buffer and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 70:30 respectively and detection was<br>
done at 288 nm. While the analysis of mosapride sustained release part was done by<br>
HPLC (Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 150 mm, Inersil Cs, 5 column using<br>
buffer and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 62:38 respectively and detection was<br>
done at 275 nm The stability studies were done as per ICH guidelines for 6 months.<br>
Rationale for In vitro dissolution media<br>
(016)	The dissolution testing of Rabeprazole sodium enteric coated tablet part was carried<br>
out in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid for 2 hrs and in phosphate buffer pH 7.8: n- Propanol (8:2)<br>
for 45 minutes. The quantity of mosapride citrate dihyrate is expressed in terms of<br>
equivalent amount of mosapride citrate. The solubility studies of mosapride citrate<br>
dihydrate was carried out as, in distilled water found to be very slightly soluble, in 0.1 N<br>
HC1 and phosphate buffer pH 6.8 practically insoluble while in sodium acetate buffer<br>
pH 3.5 it is found to be slightly soluble, the results are interpreted as per the criteria<br>
defined in USP. As per United States Pharmacopoeia criteria the quantity of the<br>
dissolution medium used should be not less than three times that required to form a<br>
saturated solution of the drug substance, which complies when used sodium acetate<br>
buffer pH 3.5 for mosapride citrate dihydrate, based on the solubility equilibrium of the<br>
drug substance, which complies when used sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5. Hence the<br>
dissolution of dosage forms carried out by using 900 ml sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5<br>
which complies with the sink conditions mentioned in USP. However USP allows use of<br>
dissolution media up to 2000 ml volume for drugs having limited solubility. (Ref.<br>
USP/NF, Vol. 27, 2004 Page no. 2514).<br><br>
