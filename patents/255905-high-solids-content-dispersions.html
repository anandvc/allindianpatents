FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition containing a metal base; a surfactant; an organic medium containing less than about 2 wt % of water; and optionally a carboxylic acid. The invention further provides a process for making the composition and a method for its use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known how to prepare a dispersion containing a metal base that is normally insoluble in an oil of lubricating viscosity such as lithium hydroxide. The dispersion containing the metal base has a low solids content (i.e. the amount of metal base in the dispersion) typically up to about 10 wt %. A dispersion of this type with a solids content greater than about 10 wt % are unstable without the presence of a large amount of surfactant to stabilise the dispersion against the metal base dropping out and forming sediment. Also a low solids dispersion contains a large amount of a carrier medium (often an oil of lubricating viscosity) and this makes transportation, storage, and dispensing of said dispersion difficult due to the volume of the medium. Furthermore, this makes the dispersion less environmentally friendly and expensive.<br>
International Publication WO 04/026996 discloses a fuel additive composition capable of reducing vanadate deposits. The composition contains a metal inorganic oxygen containing compound, a liquid soluble in oil and a dispersant including fatty acid or ester derivatives thereof.<br>

US patent 2,394,907 discloses suspending an alkali or other saponification agent in a non-reactive liquid medium and mechanically comminuting the alkali in oil until a predominant portion of the particles of alkali is as low as 5 micrometres in size. The resultant alkali is then used to make grease.<br>
US patent 4,075,234 relates to grease manufacture using a concentrated aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide in a liquid reaction mixture comprising an alkyl nitrile.<br>
US patent 4,337,209 relates to a method of preparing soap and greases by reacting an organic carboxylic acid, its esters and mixtures thereof with a concentrated aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of an inorganic salt, in a liquid reaction medium comprising acetone. The presence of the inorganic salt increases the yield of the soap or grease.<br>
US patent 5,236,607 relates to a process for preparing a lithium soap thickened grease which consists of heating a mixture of oil and a lithium base to at least 100°C, then heating the resulting mixture at a temperature in the range of 110°C to 200°C until a thickened grease is obtained. After the grease is formed it is subjected to a homogenization/milling process resulting in a smooth grease.<br>
It would be desirable to have a dispersion composition with a high solids content. The present invention provides a dispersion composition capable of providing a composition with a high solids content.<br>

The invention further provides a process for preparing a composition comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	mixing (a) a metal base; (b) a surfactant and (c) a organic medium<br>
containing less than about 2 wt % of water to form a slurry:<br>
(2)	grinding the slurry of step (1) to form a dispersion;<br>

(4)	optionally reacting the dispersion of steps (2) or (3) with a carboxylic<br>
acid containing about 2 to about 30 carbon atoms, wherein the carboxylic acid is<br>
a monocarboxylic acid, a polycarboxylic acid or mixtures thereof, and optionally<br><br>
the carboxylic acid is further substituted with groups selected from a hydroxyl group, an ester and mixtures thereof.<br>
In one embodiment the composition of the invention is obtainable by the process defined above. In one embodiment the process defined above is capable of preparing a dispersion with a metal base selected from the group consisting of: (i) a metal hydroxide with a solids content of greater than about 51 wt % of the composition; (ii) a metal base other than a metal hydroxide with a solids content of greater than about 15 wt % of the composition; and (iii) mixtures thereof.

 Examples 20-26 Magnesium Oxide Dispersions<br>
A series of magnesium oxide dispersions was prepared in a vessel using a high torque stirrer (commercially available from Stuart Scientific) capable of maintaining a stirring rate of about 200-300 rpm. The stirrer was fitted with a polypropylene or polyurethane 'U'-shaped stirring paddle. The vessel further contained about 700g of beads (3.4-4.3 mm 0). The contents of the vessel were stirred for about 8 hours and about 7.8 %(on oil free basis) of a polyisobutylene succinic acid reacted with 1,2-ethane diol and salted with two moles of 2-dimethylaminoethanol surfactant with a molecular weight in the range 1000-2300.

Example 55 (Particle Size less than IQOnm)<br>
Example is prepared by blending magnesium oxide wt % by weight with 10 wt % on an oil free basis of polyisobutylene succinic acid with a molecular weight in the range 851-1600 surfactant; and an oil of lubricating viscosity. This was first milled in an ECM Multilab Dyno Mill (supplied by WAB AG, Basle). The mill is charged with 0.3 mm 0 zirconia / yttria beads and operated with a tip speed of 8 m/s. After a residence time of 10 minutes, a 100% sub micron (mean size 298nm) dispersion is obtained. This dispersion (A) has a dynamic viscosity of 200 cP at a shear rate of 250s-1. Dispersion (A) is further milled in an NPM Pilot Dyno Mill (supplied by WAB AG, Basle). The mill is charged with 0.05 mm 0 zirconia / yttria beads. After a residence time of 10 minutes, a dispersion is obtained with a mean size below 100nm. The viscosity of the dispersion was below 400 cP at 250s-1. Comparative Example<br>
The process is the same as Example 28 except the surfactant is 12-hydroxystearic acid. However, the sample viscosity increased to such an extent<br>
that the agitation speed was reduced.  The final product largest particle size as determined by microscopy was about 7 µm in diameter. Dispersion Stability Test<br>
Dispersion are stored in sealed glass tubes in a dark room at ambient temperature and 60°C for four weeks. The results obtained from the four week dispersion stability test performed on Examples 27-51 and 54 indicate that no significant solvent layer or sediment layer formed. Examples 52 and 53 show some separation of solvent and a sediment layer. The performance of examples 52 and 53 is believed to be due to the initial excessively large particle size of the magnesium oxide. Test on Interaction of Fortuitous Water Contamination<br>
Dispersion of magnesium oxide prepared in similar processes to Examples 23-26 are contacted with 3g of water per 97g of dispersion. The dispersions containing water are mixed and then placed in an oven at 60 °C and at ambient temperature. After one week the dispersions form a top layer of water and the dispersion does not show signs of gel formation. Grease Example 1: Preparation of Grease<br>
A grease was prepared by mixing in a vessel containing about 9.8 wt% of 12-hydroxystearic acid into about 83.8 wt % of 600N base oil and heating to about 80°C to melt the 12-hydroxystearic acid. The vessel and contents were cooled to about 50°C before adding about 6.4 wt % of the product of Example 3. The vessel contents were then stirred forming a grease like material. The grease like material was then heated to about 150°C and held for about 1 hour. The grease was then cooled to about 120°C. Grease Example 2: Preparation of Grease with NLGI Consistency of 1<br>
The process is the same as Example 12, except the grease is then milled through a triple roller. The resultant grease had a dropping point of 203°C. Grease Example 3: Preparation of Grease with NLGI Consistency of 2-3<br>
The process is the same as Example 13, except the grease like material was heated to about 195°C instead of 150°C. The resultant grease had a dropping point of 204°C.<br>
Fuel Examples 1 to 63<br>
A series of fuel compositions are prepared by mixing examples 20 to 51 in middle distillate (Fuel Examples 1 to 31) and a heavy fuel oil (Fuel Examples 32 to 63) respectively. The fuel compositions have a metal content of about 1200 ppm. The fuel compositions are stored in sealed glass tubes in a dark room at ambient temperature and 60°C for up to 3 months. The appearance of the fuel compositions are studied after 24 hours for the middle distillate and after 3 months for heavy fuel oil. The fuel compositions containing the dispersion of the invention are free of precipitate and/or other phase separation. Fuel Examples 64 to 85<br>
A series of examples are prepared by a similar process to Fuel Examples 1 to 69, except the dispersion examples are from examples 8-11, 14-15 and 18-19 in middle distillate (Fuel Examples 64 to 71) and a heavy fuel oil (Fuel Examples 72 to 79) respectively. Combustion Improver in Open Flame Application Test<br>
A 50 wt % calcium hydroxide dispersion is injected at 150 ppm into a 6 megawatt (MW) boiler employing a heavy fuel oil at constant fuel flow rate. Measurements of carbon monoxide, NOX and particulate matter. In the presence of the dispersion, the particulate matter formed is 58 mg/m3.<br>
The test in the absence of the dispersion produces 90 mg/m3 of particulate matter.<br>
A magnesium oxide dispersion similar to Examples 26 to 36 is treated at 925 ppm into a 200 megawatt open flame burner. The particulate matter formed is measured, along with SO3 emissions using a LAND Conserver IV Model 220 Dew Point meter; and flue gas temperature. The data obtained by employing the magnesium oxide dispersion are shown in Table 7. Data obtained in the presence of the magnesium oxide dispersion are collected 40 hours after initial injection.<br>
