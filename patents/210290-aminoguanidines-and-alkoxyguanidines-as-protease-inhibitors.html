Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the linvention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds that function as enzyme inhibitors, and particularly to a new class of non-peptidic inhibitors of prolcolytic enzymes.<br>
Related Art<br>
Proteases are enzymes that cleave proteins at single, specific peptide bonds. Proteases can be classified into four generic classes: serine, thiol or cysteinyl, acid or aspartyl, and mclalloproleases (Cuypcrs el ai, J. Dial Client. 257:7086 (1982)). Proteases arc essential to a variety of biological activities, such as digestion, formation and dissolution of blood clots', rcproduclion and the immune reliction to foreign cells and organisms. Aberrant ptolcoiysis is associated with a number of disease stales in man and other mammals. . The human neutrophil proteases, elastase and cathepsin G, have been implicated as contributing to disease states marked by tissue destruction. These disease states include emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, corneal ulcers and glomerular nephritis.   (Barret, in Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs, Sandier, ed., University Park Press, Baltimore, (1980)). Additional proteases such as plasmin, C-l esterase, C-3 converlase, urokinase, plasminogcn activator, acrosin, and kallikreins play key roles in normal biological functions of mammals. In many instances, it is beneficial to disrupt the function of one or more proteolytic enzymes in the course of therapeutically treating a mammal.<br>
Serine proteases include such enzymes as elaslase (human leukocyte), cathepsin G, plasmin, C-I esterase, C-3 convcrtase, urokinase, plasininogen activator, acrosin, chymolrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa and kallikreins.<br>
Human leukocyte elastase is released by polymorphomiclcar leukocytes at sites of inflammation and thus is a contributing cause for a number of disease siales. Cathepsin G is another human neulrophil serine protease.  Compounds with the ability to inhibit the activity<br><br>
-2-<br>
of these enzymes are expected to haVe an miti-inllammjilory effect useful in the treiitment of gout, rheumatoid  arthritis and  other inflammatory diseases,  and  in  the  treatment  of emphysema. Cliymotrypsin and tcypsin ore digestive enzymes,  inhibitors of these enzymes are useful in treating pancreatitis.   Inhibitors of urokinase and piasminogen activator are useful in treating excessive cell growth disease slates, such as benign proslntic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma and psoriasis.<br>
The serine protease thrombin occupies a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and as a multi facto rial protein, induces a number of effects on platelets, endolhelial cells, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes, the heart, and neurons (Tapparelli et oi, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 14:366-376 (1993); Lcikovils and Topol, Circulation 90(3):1522-1536 (1994); Marker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl /):S47'-S58 (1994)). Activation of the coagulation cascade through cither the intrinsic pathway (contact activation) or the extrinsic pathway (activation by exposure of plasma to a non-endothelial surface, damage lo vessel walls or tissue factor release) lends lo a series of biochemical events thai converge on thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen ultimately leading to a hemostatic plug (clot formation), potently activates platelets through a unique proteolylic clcnvnge of the cell surface thrombin receptor (Coughlin, Seminars in linmatology 3/(4):270-277 (1994)), and nulonmplifies its own production through a feedback mechanism.    Thus, inhibitors of thrombin  function  have   therapeutic  potential   in  a  host  of cardiovascular  and   non-cardiovascular diseases, including: myoeardial infarction; unstable anginn; stroke; restenosis; deep vein thrombosis; disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by Irauma, sepsis or tumor metastasis; hemodialysis; cardiopulmonary bypass surgery; adult respiratory distress syndrome; endotoxic shock; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis; induration; metastasis; hypercoagulability during chemotherapy; Alzheimer's disease; Down's syndrome; fibrin formation in the eye; and.'wound healing. Oilier uses include the use of said thrombin inhibitors as anticoagulants cither embedded in or physically linked lo materials used in the manufacture of devices used in blood collection, blood circulation, and blood storage, such as catheters, blood dialysis machines, blood collection syringes and tubes, blood lines and stems.<br>
Factor Xa is another, serine protease in the coagulation pathway. Factor Xa associates with factor Va and calcium on a phospholipid membrane thereby forming a prothrombinase<br><br>
-3-<br>
complex. This prothiombinase complex then converts prothrombin to thrombin (Claeson, Blood Coagulation and Fibhnolysis 5:41]-436 (1994); Marker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl /):S47-S58 (1994)). Inhibitors of factor Xa arc tliought to offer an advantage over agents that directly inhibit thrombin since direct ihrombin inhibitors still permit significant new thrombin generation (Lcfkovils and Topol, Circulation .9(7(3): 1522-1536 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl J):S41-S58 (1994)).<br>
A need continues to exist for non-peptidic compounds that are potent and selective protease inhibitors, and which possess greater bioavailability and fewer side-effects than currently available protease inhibitors. Accordingly, new classes of potent protease inhibitors, characterized by potent inhibitory capacity and low mammalian toxicity, are potentially valuable therapeutic agents for a variety of conditions, including treatment of a number of mammalian protcolytic disease states.<br>
Ozawa, I-I. el af., Yakugaku Zosshi, 95(8).966-74 (1975) describe a number ofben/yl-and bcnzylidinc aminoguanidinc and atnidinohydnizonc compounds. For example, the following sails are described:<br><br>
The compounds were tested lor their elTect on blood pressure in rats,<br>
Augstein, J. el ai," .j Med. Chem.,  10(3):391-400 (1967) discloses a series of aryloxyalkylamino-guanidines of (he formula:<br><br><br>
-4-<br>
In some compounds R, is nicthoxy, while R2 is hydrogen and R3 and R, arc cither hydrogen or melhyl. Several such aminoguanidines containing chloro and methyl substituenls in the aromatic ring were shown to possess adrencrgic neuron blocking properties and to inhibit dopamine p-oxidase in vitro. The synthesis and testing of aminoguanidines containing one or more mclhoxy substitucnts in the aromatic ring is also disclosed.<br>

Phenols I (where Pa = H) arc converted to monosulfonales 2 by treatment with appropriate sulfonyl chlorides. Preferred conditions include treating phenol 1 with a sulfonyl chloride in a biphasic system composed ofan organic solvent, such as an ether, and an aqueous phase saturated with NaHCO3. Alternatively, the reaction may be effected first by deprolonaling I with one equivalent ofa strong base, most preferably Nail, in ;i polar organic solvent, such as Af.^V-dimethylformamide or letrahydrofuran,. followed by treating the deprotonated phenol with the sulfonyl chloride. Still alternatively, phenol 1, in a typical organic solvent, such as dichloromethane, may be converted to 2 by treating the phenol with sulfonyl chloride in the presence ofan amine base, such as 4-methylmorpholine.<br>
Phenols 1 may be monoprotecled (Pa is a protecting group) with a variety of protecting groups known in the art. such as esters and benzyl ethers (Greene, T.W. and Wuls, P.G.M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York (1991)). Deprotection of the hydroxy groups is routinely accomplished using the reaction conditions well known in the art. l;or example, dcproteclion of benzyl ethers may be effected through catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon as a catalyst in solvents such as cthanol or tetrahydrofuran. Deprotcction ofan acetate is accomplished by basic hydrolysis, most preferably with sodium hydroxide in aqueous letrahydrofuran.<br>
Phenols 2 are coupled to 3 (for I. - Oil) using a Mitsunobu coupling procedure (Mitsunobu, O., Synthesis 1 (1981)), where P1' of 3 may be a suitable alcohol protecting group. Alternatively, suitable diols (Ph = I-I) may be used in the Mitsunobu reaction. Preferred coupling conditions include using a trialkylphosphinc or triarylphosphinc, such as Iriphenylphosphine or trwj-bulylphosphine, in a suitable solvent, such as telrahydrofuran or dichloromethane, and an azodicarbonyl reagent, such as diethyl azodicarboxylate or l,l'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine. Typical Pb (where Pb is an alcohol protecting group) is well known in the art, such as esters and benzyl ethers (Greene, T.W. and Wuls, P.G.M., supra). Alternatively, where L is a reactive leaving group such as lialide or sulfonate, phenol 2 may be treated with a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent, such as 7V,A^-dimclhylformamide, and then treated with 3. Removal of P'1 is routinely accomplished using the reaction conditions well known in the art. For example, dcprolcction of benzyl ethers may be effected through catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon as a catalyst in solvents such as cthanol or letrahydrofuran.    Dcprolcction of an acetate is<br><br>
-33 -<br>
accomplished by basic hydrolysis, most preferably with sodium hydroxide in aqueous iclrahydrofuran.<br>
Alternatively still, alcohol 4 can be obtained by reduction of the appropriate aldehyde or kctone 7 (obtained from 2 as described below) with a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium or lithium borohydride (Wallbridge, J. Prog. Jnorg. Chem 77:99-231 (1970)).<br>
Alcohol 4 is converted to 9 employing a Mitsunobu reaction with an //-hydroxycyclic imide derivative such as AMiydroxyphthalimide. Unveiling of the phthalimidc protecting group is accomplished using standard conditions well known in the art (Greene, T.W. and Wuts, P.G.M., supra), for example, sodium borohydride in a mixture of an appropriate alcohol (e.g. ethanol or 2-propanoI)/ water followed by acidification. Alternatively, removal of the protecting group may be accomplished using hydrazine or methylamine.<br>
Guanidinylation of the resulting alkoxyamine to 10 is achieved using standard reagents such as aminoiminosulfonic acid (Miller, A. B. and Bischoff, J. .1. Synthesis 777 (1986)), or 17/-pyra/ole-l-c;uboxnmidine hydrochloiide (Bcrnatowicz, M. S. ct. til. J, Org. Chem 57(8):2497 (1992)), or with substituted guanidinylating reagents such as /V,7\/'-bis(/c77-butoxycatbonyl)- S-mclhylisothioutca (Bergeron, R.J. and McManis. J.S. .7. Org. Chem. 52:1700 (1987)) or N-R\ N-R\ A'-Rc-l//-pyrazole-l-carboxamidine, where Ra, Rb and Rc are defined as above for Formula /. Useful l//-pyrazole-l-carboxamidines include Af,Ar-bis(ft'/7-butoxycarbonyl)-l//-pyrazolc-l-carboxamidine and 7V,7V'-bis(benzyloxycarbonyl)-l/V-pyrazole-l-carboxamidine (all of which can be prepared according to Bernatowicz, M.S. et. a!., Tetrahedron Letters J-/:3389 (1993)).<br>
Conversion of alcohol 4 to the corresponding aldehyde or kctone 7 is accomplished using routine procedures for the oxidation of alcohols (see for example Corey, I7.A, Sundberg, R.J. Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B: Reactions and Synthesis, 3rd edition, Plenum Press, New York (1990)) such as the Swcrn oxidation (Mancuso, A.J. et al. Journal of Organic Chemistry 3329 (1976)) pyridinium chlorochromate (Corey, E.J. and Suggs, J.W. Tetrahedron Letters 2647 (1975)) pyridinium dichromatc (Corey, E.J. and Schmidt, G. Tetrahedron Letters 399 (1979)), or sulfur trioxide pyridine complex / dimethylsulfoxide {Tetrahedron Letters 2S:\(M (1987)).<br>
Still alternatively, 2 may be coupled directly to 5 where L - OH or a reactive leaving group sucii as halide, alky! sulfonate, or aryl sulfonatc. ¦ In the case of L - OH, the<br><br>

Mitsunobu coupling procedure may be used. In cases where L is a reactive leaving group such as halidc or sulfonatc, phenol 2 may be treated with a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent, such as MM-dimelhylformamidc, and then treated with 5.<br>
Alternatively., phenol 2 may be converted to 7 by the Mitsunobu reaction using 6 wherein L = OH and Pc is an aldehyde or ketone protecting group which is well known in the art (Greene, T.W. nnd Wuls, P.CM., supra), for example, a dimethyl ketal or acetal,<br>
1,3-dioxolane group, or 1,3-dioxane group. Alternatively, where L of 6 is a reactive leaving group such as halide or sulfonale&gt; phenol 2 may be treated with a base, such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as A'.A'-dimcthylformamide, and then treated with 6. Pc may then be removed to afford 7 using standard conditions well known in the art, for example, /7-toluencsulfonic acid in acetone (Greene, T.W. and Wuls, l'.G.M., supra).<br>
Compound 7 is then converted to nmidinohydrnzonc 8 using standard conditions, for example, treatment with an aminoguanidine, such, as aminoguanidinc or 2-hydrazinoimidazoline, optionally in the presence of an acid such as nitric acid, hydrogen chloride, or hydrogen bromide, in an appropriate solvent, for example, cthanol or methanol, which, in addition, may contain other solvents such as diehloromethane or tctrahydrofuran. Conversion of S to 11 is accomplished under reducing conditions well known in the art, for example, lithium borohydride in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or methanol at various temperatures up to reflux. As an alternative method, catalytic hydrogenntion with palladium on carbon catalyst can be employed.<br>
When Rn, Rb and/or Rc arc a protecting group, for example l-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), these protecting groups can be optionally removed by treatment with acid, usually trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromelhane or water, or by HC1 gas dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as 1,4-dioxane.<br><br><br>

Phenols 1 are monoprotected (Pa is a protecting group) with a variety of protecting groups known in the nit such as esters, and benzyl ethers (Greene, T.W. &amp; Wuts, P.G.M., supra). Monoprotected phenols 1 are coupled to 3 as described for Scheme la, Oeprotection and another Mhsunobu coupling with an ;V-hydroxy imide derivative, such as AMiydroxyphthalimide, as described for Scheme fa, gives the alkoxyphthalimidcs 16. The removal of ihe pbthatimide group, as described for Scheme la, produces the alkoxyamine. The alkoxyamines are subsequently converted to the optionally protected alkoxyguanidines, using the standard guanidinylation reagents, sucli as aminoiminosulfonic acid (Miller, A.

Schcme Ic outlines the synthesis of the 1,2-benzcncdisulfo derivatives described in Examples 34-79. In particular, Examples 34-68 were synthesized by the reaction of ],2-bcnzencdisulfonic anhydride 18 (Koeberg-Telder ei al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin 1198 (1973)) with secondary amines, R13RMNI1, in (he presence of a base such as a tcrliary amine where R'3 and R14 are as defined above, provided that they are both other than hydrogen. The resultant monosulfonie acid salt is converted to the sulfonyl chloride.in situ by reaction with 1 equivalent of oxalyl chloride. The resultant sulfonyl chloride is reacted in situ with the phenol 17. The optional guanidine protecting groups, R\ Rh, and Rc, may be removed as outlined for Scheme la to give 19.<br>

Phenols 1 are reacted with 2-bromo-2-methyl propanamide in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, to give the aryloxyamides 20. The aryloxyamides 20 are treated with sodium hydride in a high boiling solvent, such as 1,3-dimelhyl-3,4,5,6-tctrahydro-2(UI)-pyrimidinone, at an elevated temperature (e.g., 100 °C for 3 h) and undergo the Smiles rearrangement to the anilidcs 21 (Cotls &amp; Southcott,./. Chem. Soc. FT I 767 (1990)). The anilidcs 21 are hydrolyzed using strong base and elevated temperature (e.g., ION sodium hydroxide at reflux) for extended times (e.g., 2 days) in order to provide the corresponding anilines 22. The anilines 22 are converted to sulfonamides 23 by the reaction with sullbnyl chlorides in the presence ol'a suitable base, such as a tertiary amine. The sulfonamidcs 23 arc reacted with base (e.g., cesium carbonate) and R|(ll, where L is a reactive leaving group, such as halidc or sulfonale. Alternatively, the anilines 22 are converted to carboxamides by the reaction with acyl chlorides (R'COCl) in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine. Still alternatively, the carboxamides may be produced by the reaction of anilines 22 with carboxylic acids (R'COOIl) by any of the known peptidc coupling reagents, such as 1.3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or Castro's reagent (BOP) (Castro B., et al., Tetrahedron Lett, 1219 (1975)). The phenolic protecting group, P\ is then removed and the resultant phenols 24 are coupled with 3 as described for Scheme la. After removal of the alcohol protecting group, Pb, the alcohol is coupled to AMiydroxy imides, such as AMiydroxyphthalimide, as described for Scheme ///.

In a typical K; determination, into each well of a 96 well plate is pipetted 280 fiL of substrate solution, 10 j.iL of test compound solution, and the plate allowed to thermally equilibrate at 37°C in a Molecular Devices plate reader for &gt; 15 minutes. Reactions were initiated by tiie addition of a 10 LIL aliquot of enzyme and the absorbancc increase at 405 nm is recorded for 15 minutes. Dala corresponding to less than 10% of the total substrate hydrolysis were used in the calculations. The ratio of the velocity (rate of change in absorbance as a function of time) for a sample containing no test compound is divided by the velocity of a sample containing test compound, and is plotted as a function of test compound concentration. The data are fit to a linear regression, and the value of the slope of the line calculated. The inverse of the slope is the experimentally determined Kj value.
