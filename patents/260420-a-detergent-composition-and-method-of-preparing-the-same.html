COMPLETE SPECIFICA TION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a detergent composition. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Conventional dry mix detergent product formulations are based on synthetic soda ash which is very pure in quality and free from organic matter, clay insolubles and fluorides. Dry detergent compositions are formed by mixing soda ash with one or more surfactants. In addition to soda ash and surfactants, other additives such as builders, brighteners, soil release agents, perfumes etc are also added to detergents. Normally, detergent product is free flow, good bright blue color and exhibits good performance in cleaning and detergency.<br>
In detergents soda ash acts as a builder to emulsify oil stains, to reduce the deposit of dirt during washing and rinsing, to deliver a smoother surface in the formulation, to provide alkalinity for cleaning, and to soften laundry water. In powdered laundry detergent, soda ash conditions the water and enhances the processing and performance of formulated cleaning products. Two grades of soda ash i.e., light soda ash and dense soda ash are used for the production of detergents. However, since soda ash has to be manufactured, the cost of manufacturing soda ash adds to the cost of the detergent.<br>
In view of this there is a need to develop a detergent composition that is based on a cheaper and naturally available raw material in place of soda ash. Moreover, the detergent composition should be free flowing. SUMMARY<br>
The invention relates to a detergent composition comprising of crushed refined soda fines, the crushed refined soda fines obtained from washing of crude trona soda. The amount of crushed refined soda fines is between 20 to 40% by weight and preferably the amount of crushed refined soda fines is substantially 30%.<br><br><br>
The invention also relates to a detergent composition comprising an enzyme and at least one source of bicarbonate.<br>
The invention relates to a method of preparing a detergent comprising mixing crushed refined soda fines with a salt, the crushed refined soda fines obtained from washing of crude trona soda, adding a first surfactant to the mixture while continuing the mixing, adding preferably by spraying an optical brightener to the mixture, adding a second surfactant to the mixture, and adding a flow aid to the mixture to obtain a free flow detergent.

By way of a specific example to establish the effectiveness of enzyme at higher pH ranges, specific formulations are designed to give pH in the range from 9.0 to 11.0 in a 1% solution. Fresh cotton cloth after reflectance measurement was stained with chicken blood. Chicken blood was dispersed in water and cloth was completely dipped in the blood - water and soaked for 10 minutes. Cloth was then dried in the sun and cut into pieces of 5cm by 5cm. Reflectance was measured. Blood stained pieces of cloths were washed in the Launder -o- meter with 2% solution of a sample of the formulations for 10 minutes at ambient temperature of 30 deg C. After washing, washed pieces of cloths were dried in sun and reflectance is measured. Figure 2 tabulates the result. It is observed that all three experiments 1,2 and 4 at pH ranges 9.25, 10.48 and 10.95 has shown better detergency at 76.4%, 79.34% and 82.16% respectively as against control experiment 3 without enzymes at pH 10.75 with detergency at 69.79%.

By way of illustration, the following formulations have displayed the required detergency ability. Formulation A<br>
By way of a specific example the detergent composition comprises of between 25 to 35% of crushed refined soda fines, 30 to 40% salt, 0.30 to 0.05% of color, 8 to 15% sulphonic acid, 0.05 to 0.25% optical brightener, 0.5% to 1.5% sodium lauryl sulphate, 7% to 20% micronized dolomite, 0.5 to 5% precipitated silica, 0.2 to 0.5% enzyme, and 1% to 3% speckle. This formulation is particularly suited for hard water. Formulation B<br><br><br>
By way of a specific example the detergent composition comprises of between 25 to 35% of crushed refined soda fines, 30 to 40% salt, 8 to 15% sulphonic acid, 7 % to 20 % micronized dolomite (flow agent), 0.5 to 5% precipitated silica, 1 to 5% sodium silicate, 0.2 to 0.5% enzyme, 0.05 to 0.25% optical brightener, 0.30 to 0.05% of color and 1 to 3% speckle. This formulation is particularly suited for soft water. Formulation C<br>
By way of a specific example the detergent composition comprises of between 25 to. 35% of crushed refined soda fines, 30 to 40% salt, 0.5 to 2% Alpha Olefin sulphonate, 0.05 to 0.25% optical brightener, 0.30 to 0.05% of color, 7 % to 20 % micronjzed dolomite (flow agent), 8 to 15% sulphonic acid,0.0250.1% perfume,0.5 to 5% precipitated silica, I Co 7% sodium tripolyphosphate, and 0.25 to 0.75% titanium dioxide. This formulation is particularly suited for hard water. Formulation D<br>
By way of a specific example the detergent composition comprises of between 25 to 35% of crushed refined soda fines, 30 to 40% salt, 0.5 to 2% sodium lauryl sulphate, 0.05 to 0.25% optical brightener, 0.30 to 0.05% of color, 7 % to 20 % micrqnized dolomite (flow agent), 8% to 15% sulphonic acid, 0.025% to 0.1% perfume, 0.5% to 5% precipitated silica, 1% to 5% carboxy methyl cellulose, 1% to 5% Sodium silicate, 1% to 3% speck^ and Q.2% to 0.5% enzyme. This formulation is particularly suited for soft water.<br>
When used in a detergent formulation suited for harq water, crushed refined soda fines reduces the hardness of water. The fluoride content in the crushed refined soda fines reacts with the calcium that is present in hard water, to form insoluble Calcium Fluoride by the following formula:<br><br><br>
2NaF + CaCl2 =  2NaCl + CaF2<br>
This removes the calcium that is present in hard water. Thus no loss of active detergent takes place and no or very small quantity of sequestering agent is required in the formulation.<br>
By way of a specific example, 2.25gms of a sample of product A and B; and S (soda ash containing detergent as control) were dissolved separately in 250 gm of hard water (containing 200ppm of Ca) and soft water (containing 25ppm of Ca) by agitation for 15 minutes. Fluoride was analyzed in the soluble and insoluble part of the solution. Results of analysis indicate that entire quantity of fluoride is precipitated as calcium fluoride. Loss of active detergent is less in formulation A and B as compared to the control S as indicated in Figure 1.<br>
By way of a specific example, 2.25gm of a sample of crushed refined soda fines was dissolved in hard water containing 250 gm of hard water containing 20.0 ppm of Ca by agitation for 15 minutes. Solution was analyzed for fluorine. As indicated by figure 1 more than 95% of fluorine present in the beneficiated crushed refined soda fines reacts with calcium ions present in hard water and reduces hardness by more than 50%.<br>
By way of a specific example a detergent composition is formed by the process comprising of mixing together crushed refined soda fines, salt and color in a mixer. On the mixture so obtained sulphonic acid is first sprayed on with the mixing on, followed by spraying the optical brightener. To this mixture a second surfactant along with the sodium silicate and antiredeposition agent is then added and mixed. To this mixture flow agents like micronized dolomite and precipitated silica are then added to make the detergent completely free flowing. To this mixture other ingredients such as titanium oxide, speckles, perfume and enzymes are added to form a detergent composition.<br><br><br>
In accordance with an embodiment each step is carried out for a predetermined period of time.<br>
The detergent composition described uses a waste product; crushed refined soda fines that is produced during soda ash manufacture. Moreover, the detergents composition as described is suitable for use in both soft and hard water.<br>
