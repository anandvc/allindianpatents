				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of retransmitting an original frame, in<br>
particular for enhanced uplink channel (E-DCH) for 3rd generation project<br>
partnership (3GPP) frequency division duplex (FDD).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Proposals have been made that in E-DCH retransmission of a data transmission<br>
for enhanced dedicated physical data channel (E-DPDCH), where at least one of<br>
the original transmission or the retransmission is in compressed mode, should be<br>
on the basis that the mapping of data to slots is unchanged, so that if a<br>
retransmission frame has more available slots than in the original transmission,<br>
no more of them are used than were used for the original transmission and the<br>
remaining slots are subject to discontinuous transmission (DTX).<br>
It has also been assumed that the same method should be followed for<br>
retransmission of the enhanced dedicated physical control channel (E-DPCCH).<br>

ISSN: 0000-0001 teaches a method for retransmitting an original frame and a<br>
transmission method with a different number of slots available in different<br>
frames.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method of retransmitting an original<br>
frame comprises mapping data bits to a lower number of slots than the number<br>
of slots available for a retransmission frame; and transmitting control channels in<br>
all available slots of the retransmission frame, wherein the number of available<br>
slots in the retransmission frame is greater than the number of available slots in<br>
the original frame.<br>
The data channel cannot use all available slots, but is limited to a lower<br>
number than the total number available. The control channel uses all available<br>
slots, so optimising required transmit power and the resulting interference and<br>
coverage.<br>
Data bits could be mapped to a different number of slots, for example if<br>
more slots are available in the retransmission frame, but preferably, the data bits<br>
are mapped to the same number of slots as in the original frame.<br>
The position of each slot in the retransmission frame may change, relative<br>
to the original transmission frame, so that data bits are in different slot positions<br>
for the retransmission, but preferably, the position of each slot in a<br>
retransmission frame is the same as its position in the original frame.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises adapting the control channel<br>
power per slot of the retransmission frame, such that the average control<br>
channel power per retransmission frame is substantially unchanged with respect<br>
to the average control channel power per original frame.<br>
In the situation where the number of slots used in the original<br>
transmission and in the retransmission is the same, preferably, the method<br>
further comprises adapting the data channel power per slot of the retransmission<br>
frame, such that the average data channel power per retransmission frame is<br><br><br>
substantially unchanged with respect to the average data channel power per<br>
original frame.<br>
Alternatively, if the number of data slots in the retransmission frame is<br>
greater than in the original frame, then preferably the power per slot is<br>
substantially unchanged, rather than the average power.<br>
In one example, the retransmission is in an uncompressed frame.<br>
Alternatively, the retransmission is in a compressed frame.<br>
Preferably, the data channel is enhanced dedicated physical data channel<br>
(E-DPDCH) and the control channel is enhanced dedicated physical control<br>
channel (E-DPCCH).<br>
In addition, the control channel comprises a dedicated physical control<br>
channel (DPCCH).<br>
Although, different TTI's can be used, preferably, the frame has a<br>
transmission time interval (TTI) of 10ms.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
An example of a method of retransmitting a frame according to the present<br>
invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a current method of handling retransmission of<br>
data using E-DPDCH;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a first example of a method of retransmitting a frame<br>
according to the present invention; and,<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a second example of the method of the present invention.<br><br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, if an initial transmission overlaps with a compressed frame the<br>
user equipment (UE), such as a mobile phone or laptop, calculates a power<br>
reduction, P to be used in enhanced transport format combination (E-TFC)<br>
selection in conjunction with the maximum power ratio granted by the Node B<br>
scheduler. The power reduction, P is related to the length of the compressed<br>
mode gap in the frame, i.e.<br>
P = 10log10(15/n1), where n1 is the number of slots available for the initial<br>
transmission.<br>
The E-TFC selection is otherwise done as if the frame is not to be compressed,<br>
but the UE uses ∆non-compressed,cf [dB] = granted power offset [dB] - P [dB] as the<br>
maximum allowed power ratio.<br>
The selection of spreading factor and rate matching are done considering the<br>
actual number of slots available for transmission and all the bits after rate<br>
matching are transmitted. The purpose of the operation above is to reduce the<br>
payload transmitted in a compressed mode (CM) frame by selecting a smaller<br>
transport block than would be used for a non-compressed frame in order to<br>
maintain approximately the same maximum transmitted power over the<br>
transmitted slots. Non-scheduled transmissions are not subject to any power<br>
ratio limitations imposed to the E-TFC selection process, so the puncturing limit<br>
may be exceeded in this case with rates above 384 kbps, but this is unlikely to<br>
cause a problem.<br><br><br>
For this conventional example, if a retransmission occurs in a compressed frame<br>
regardless of whether the initial transmission was compressed or not, or if a<br>
retransmission occurs in a non-compressed frame if the initial transmission was<br>
compressed, then a retransmission frame is generated assuming n1 slots (i.e. the<br>
spreading factor selection and rate matching are based on n1 slots; and at least<br>
the slots that overlap with the CM gap in the retransmission are subject to<br>
discontinuous transmission (DTX). n2 slots of coded bits for the retransmission<br>
are transmitted in the first available n2 slots in the retransmission frame, where<br>
n2 = min(n1, number of slots available for the retransmission). If more than n1<br>
slots are available for the retransmission, the last n3 available slots of the frame<br>
are subject to DTX, where n3 = (number of slots available for retransmission -<br>
n1).<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example of the operation for the case of a 7-slot<br>
compressed mode transmission gap in the initial transmission frame and a 4-slot<br>
compressed mode transmission gap in the retransmission frame. The frame<br>
length , or TTI, may vary, but for 3GPP FDD, it is typically 10ms. For an initial<br>
transmission 1 a number of transmitted slots 2, n1, are provided followed by a<br>
slot transmission gap 3. For this example n1 = 8 and the gap is 7 slots long. In<br>
a retransmission 4 there are 15 slots in total in the frame of which 4 have been<br>
defined as a compressed mode transmission gap 5 and the number of<br>
transmitted slots n2 = min (n1, 11) = 8. These eight slots 6, 7 are distributed<br>
around the gap 5. The remaining slots 8 are calculated as n3 = 11 - n1 = 3 and<br>
these slots are DTX slots because they are not required for data.<br>
In a situation where all initial transmissions are compressed; where all<br>
retransmissions are compressed; or where all retransmissions of a compressed<br>
initial transmission are non-compressed, then the gain factor βed of the E-DPDCH<br>
is scaled according to the formula below, n1 being the number of available slots<br>
in the initial transmission.<br><br><br>
NPilot,c is the number of DPCCH pilot bits per slot in the current frame (regardless<br>
of whether it is an initial transmission or a retransmission) and<br>
NPilot,N is the number of DPCCH pilot bits per slot in non-compressed frames.<br>
The factor simply avoids the E-DPDCH power being increased by<br>
the offset that is applied to the DPCCH to keep the pilot energy per slot constant<br>
when the DPCCH slot format is changed between compressed and non-<br>
compressed frames. This has nothing to do with the number of transmitted slots<br>
per frame.<br>
For E-DCH there are two sub channels; a control channel (E-DPCCH) and<br>
a data channel (E-DPDCH). In addition, a further control channel (DPCCH) has to<br>
accompany all E-DPDCH transmissions. As illustrated by Fig. 1, in conventional<br>
operation, a transmission time interval (TTI) consists of 15 timeslots. The E-<br>
DPCCH signalling formation comprising a retransmission sequence number and<br>
an enhanced transport format combination indicator (E-TFCI) which are 3<br>
timeslots in length and repeated 5 times. The E-DPDCH is mapped to all 15<br>
timeslots.<br>
In compressed mode, the user equipment (UE) transmitter is turned off<br>
for a portion of the timeslots, known as discontinuous transmission (DTX). In this<br>
case, the E-DPCCH is transmitted in the remaining timeslots with increased<br>
power. The E-DPDCH is mapped to the remaining timeslots.<br><br><br>
An integral part of the E-DCH operation is hybrid automatic repeat request<br>
(HARQ). If the Node B has not properly received an uplink transmission, it may<br>
request a retransmission. For the "chase combining" mode of retransmission,<br>
i.e. retransmitting the same data more than once, the retransmission must have<br>
the same form and mapping of bits as the first transmission and only the position<br>
of transmitted slots within the retransmission frame can be different. In the case<br>
where the first transmission was made in a compressed mode frame; the data<br>
will have been mapped to a reduced number of slots. If a retransmission is made<br>
in a frame that is not in compressed mode, the mapping of bits to slots for the<br>
first transmission cannot be altered. Therefore in slots that were in DTX during<br>
the first transmission, the E-DPDCH is not transmitted in a retransmission.<br>
In order to minimise transmit power required for E-DPCCH, the E-DPCCH<br>
should be transmitted in any available slots. Thus, in the present invention, if<br>
retransmissions for E-DCH contain more non DTX slots than the first<br>
transmission, then the E-DPDCH is only transmitted using the same number of<br>
slots as in the first transmission and TX power is kept the same as the first<br>
transmission, but the E-DPCCH is transmitted using all of the slots available in<br>
the second transmission and the TX power scaled according to the number of<br>
available slots; and the DPCCH is transmitted in all available slots<br>
Fig.2 illustrates one example of the method of the present invention. In<br>
Fig. 2a, a frame 10 is to be transmitted in compressed mode, so from the total<br>
number of time slots in the frame, a proportion of slots 11 are DTX. In the<br>
remaining slots 12 both the E-DPDCH 13 and the E-DPCCH 14 are transmitted for<br>
the first transmission. However, a retransmission 17 is required as shown in<br>
Figure 2b, but this retransmission is not compressed. In this case, the E-DPDCH<br>
13 is still limited to those slots 12 which were not DTX in the original<br>
transmission. However, E-DPCCH is not so constrained and retransmits in all<br>
available time slots 11,12 of the second transmission.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates another example of the present invention. The first<br>
transmission, Fig. 3a, has the same arrangement as with Fig. 2a, i.e. there are a<br>
number of DTX slots 11 due to the transmission being of a compressed mode<br>
frame. The E-DPDCH 13 and E-DPCCH 14 are both transmitted in the remaining<br>
slots 12. However, the retransmission in this example is also compressed, so<br>
some of the slots 15 are DTX. In order for the E-DPDCH to be transmitted using<br>
the same number of slots, the position of these must change, so the first 3 of<br>
the original DTX slots 11 are not used, but the last two slots 16 are used to<br>
compensate for the fact that the slots 15 are now DTX. Thus, E-DPDCH 13 is<br>
transmitted on the same number of slots, but in different actual slots from in the<br>
original frame, and E-DPCCH 14 is transmitted on more slots 18 and also<br>
different ones to avoid the DTX slots in the retransmission.<br>
The present invention enables the UE to transmit in a different numbers of<br>
slots with different relative power levels for DPCCH/E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH in<br>
compressed mode.<br>
In a specific example for 3GPP FDD, using compressed frames in the<br>
uplink (UL) and where E-DCH TTI length is 2 ms, transmission gaps on the<br>
DPCH(s) due to compressed mode are handled by higher layer scheduling and<br>
the UE does not transmit E-DCH data in a TTI which fully or partly overlaps with<br>
an uplink transmission gap.<br>
For an E-DCH TTI length of 10 ms, the parameters nfirst and nlast are used to<br>
determine the transmission gap due to uplink compressed mode in the current<br>
radio frame. If the start of the transmission gap is allocated in the current frame<br>
nfirst=nfirstelse nlast=0. If the end of a transmission gap is allocated in the current<br>
frame nlast=nlast else nlast=14.<br><br>
If an initial transmission overlaps with a compressed frame the starting<br>
slot of the consecutive idle slots within the E-DCH TTI is nfirst and nfirst is the final<br>
idle slot within the 10 ms E-DCH TTI. The number of transmitted slots ntx is<br>
given by ntx= 14+nfirst nlast. If the initial transmission occurs in a non-compressed<br>
frame nts=15.<br>
If a retransmission occurs in a compressed frame the maximum number<br>
of slots available for the retransmission is given by nmax=14+nfirst nfirst. Otherwise,<br>
the maximum number of slots available for the retransmission nmax is 15.<br>
If the initial transmission was compressed and in the retransmission more<br>
than ntx slots are available for transmission (nmax&gt;ntx), the last ndtx =nmax-ntx<br>
available slots of the E-DPDCH frame are idle slots. The E-DPDCH transmission<br>
gap when a retransmission occurs in a compressed frame or a retransmission<br>
occurs in a non-compressed frame, if the initial transmission was compressed, is<br>
defined as follows:<br><br><br>
As applied in the specific example of this invention, the method allows for<br>
chase combining during hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmissions<br>
for a data channel, (in this case E-DPDCH), whilst optimising the required<br>
transmit power and hence the resulting interference and also coverage for the<br>
associated control channels (E-DPCCH/DPCCH). The method relies on<br>
transmitting the E-DPDCH using the same number of slots as in the first<br>
transmission, whilst transmitting the associated control channels (E-<br>
DPCCH/DPCCH) using all available slots in the retransmission and scaling the<br>
power appropriately.<br><br>
