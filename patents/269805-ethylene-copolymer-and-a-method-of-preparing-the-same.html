The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
?DESCRIPTION?<br>
?Technical Field?<br>
	The present invention relates to ethylene copolymers and a process for preparing the same.  More specifically, it relates to ethylene copolymer exhibiting excellent processibility and physical properties due to its multimodal molecular weight distribution index, and a process for preparing the same via multi-stage synthesis.<br><br>
?Background Art?<br>
	Generally, polymers polymerized by using a single site catalyst show narrow molecular weight distribution and uniform distribution of comonomers, with higher copolymerization activity than that of Ziegler-Natta catalyst.  However, due to their narrow molecular weight distribution, the processing would require large energy consumption and be difficult to be performed by using existing equipments, but increasing the processing cost.  When the techniques for polymerizing olefin by the use of single site catalyst are analyzed from the viewpoint of conventional commercialized processes, they can be directly applied (in case of a high-pressure solution process) if the solubility of the single site catalyst in solvent is sufficiently high, and significant issues would be stability of catalyst at relatively high polymerization temperature, and removal of catalytic activity during the work-up process after the reactor, as well as separation of impurities and reaction inhibitors during the course of isolating, purifying and recovering the solvent.<br>
In order to ensure processibility as well as improved physical properties of ethylene copolymer which is polymerized by using single site transition metal catalyst, it is advantageous for the copolymer to have broader molecular weight distribution, or molecular weight distribution showing two or more peaks in the molecular weight distribution curve.<br>
In order to manufacture such ethylene copolymer with improved processibility and physical properties, US Patent 4,935,474 discloses a process wherein two or more metallocene catalysts having different reaction rates are used in one reactor.  According to this process, however, it is difficult to prepare ethylene copolymer with various density distributions, though polymers having relatively broad molecular weight distribution or bimodal molecular weight distribution could be prepared.<br>
US Patent 3,592,880, EP 057420 and 237294, GB Patent 2020672, or the like disclose slurry-slurry multi-stage polymerization processes; GB Patent 1505017, EP 040992, US Patent 4,420,592, or the like gas-gas multi-stage polymerization processes; and GB Patent 1532231, US Patent 4,368,291, 4,309,521, 4,368,304 or the like slurry-gas multi-stage processes.  Though WO 9212182 states that two or more stage are possible for gas process in a slurry-gas process, only bimodal molecular weight distribution via a two-stage process is shown, due to catalyst characteristics and accordingly introduction of hydrogen.  Examples of the patent suggest production of ethylene copolymer with restricted density of at least 0.930 g/cm3, so that the process implies limitation to produce ethylene copolymer resin of various use, such as film with high impact strength.<br>
WO 1994/17112 proposes a process for preparing ethylene copolymer with broad molecular weight distribution by using metallocene and Ziegler-Natta catalyst in solution polymerization, but this process provides only bimodal molecular weight distribution with limitation in improvement of physical properties of the polymer through the modified process.<br>
US Patent 6,277,931 also discloses a process for polymerizing ethylene having bimodal molecular weight distribution by using heterogeneous catalyst (metallocene and Ziegler-Natta) in a solution polymerization process.  However, when heterogeneous catalyst is used in a system, interference between the heterogeneous catalysts or with cocatalyst may occur, so that the reaction would be hardly controlled.  The cocatalyst for Ziegler-Natta catalyst may act as catalyst poison or reaction inhibitor against single site catalyst.<br>
WO 2006/048257 proposed a process for ethylene copolymer with broad molecular weight distribution and trimodal molecular weight distribution via three reactors.  The process is designed as a slurry-gas process wherein high density polyethylene with high molecular weight is partially synthesized in a prepolymer reactor prior to the slurry process, and then slurry and gas phase process are carried out to provide ethylene copolymer having trimodal and broad molecular weight distribution.  However, the high molecular weight portion with high density may result in deleterious effect on impact strength of film from the aspect of overall resin.<br>
US Patent 6,372,864 proposed a process for preparing ethylene copolymer having satisfactory physical properties and processibility by using single site catalyst containing phosphinimine ligand(s) in two stirred tank reactors.  According to the process, however, a large amount of comonomer should be employed in the process to give low density, due to the catalyst property, and thus comonomer would remain in the final polymer product to cause problems in odor and hygiene. <br>
US Patent 6,995,216 suggests a process for preparing ethylene copolymer having broad molecular weight distribution by using single site catalyst containing crosslinked indenoindolyl ligand(s) in a multi-stage or multiple reactor(s).  But the process does not consider complete mixing of the reactants through the multi-stage, so that the polymer synthesized in each stage may have disadvantages due to insufficient mixing.<br><br>
?Disclosure?<br>
?Technical Problem?<br>
	In order to overcome the problems of conventional techniques, the present inventors carried out extensive studies, and invented a multi-stage solution reaction process for preparing ethylene copolymer having narrow molecular weight distribution and uniform density distribution with controlling the  features of ethylene copolymer by the multi-stage synthetic process using appropriate single site catalyst to improve physical properties as well as processibility of the ethylene copolymer.  Thus, the polymers having various molecular weights, comonomer contents or densities are prepared with different monomers, comonomer compositions, reaction temperatures, reaction pressures, or the like, in individual reactors among two or more reactors connected in multi-stage.<br>
	Specifically, according to the multi-stage solution reaction process as described above, ethylene copolymers having different density distribution with multi-modal molecular weight distribution, preferably at least bimodal or more molecular weight distribution, can be prepared in each reactor by using a-olefin comonomer having at least three carbon atoms.  The invention is completed based on such discoveries.  Particularly, copolymers having high molecular weight can be prepared by using single site catalyst according to the present invention, in spite of high degree of comonomer coupling.<br>
	Thus, as a solution of such problems, one object of the invention is to provide ethylene copolymer having multi-modal molecular weight distribution with improved physical properties as well as processibility which is prepared via multi-stage synthesis of ethylene or a-olifin, and a process for preparing the same.<br>
	Another object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages caused by preparation by blending, and to provide ethylene copolymer which can be easily produced and applied to various use, and a process for preparing the same.<br><br>

The ethylene copolymers according to the invention can be prepared via at least two stages, and have narrow molecular weight distribution.

Furthermore, a stage to provide at least bimodal molecular weight distribution is applied to the process in order to overcome the low processibility due to narrow molecular weight distribution of the polymer polymerized by using a single site catalyst.  A solution polymerization process, wherein high molecular weight a-olefin preferably having at least 3 carbon atoms, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms can be applied as comonomer, is carried out.<br>
Thus, due to lower density of the high molecular weight portion than that of other molecular weight portion, the existing frequency of tie molecules in the molecular chain increases, so that impact strength is increased in case of being used for film, and long-term durability at high temperature is improved in case of being used as pipe. <br>

2.	Solution polymerization process<br>
Since ethylene polymerization of the present invention is carried out with at least two stages, two or more reactors are required.  Two or three polymerization stages are performed to give broad molecular weight distribution.<br>
The process for preparing ethylene copolymer according to the invention is carried out at reaction temperature of 80 ~ 210? (stage (a)), and 90 ~ 220? (stage (b)), under pressure of 20 ~ 500 atm. <br>
In stage (a), polymerization is carried out in the presence of said catalyst or catalyst composition, at a temperature from 80 to 210?, more preferably from 80 to 150? under a pressure from 20 to 500 atm, more preferably from 30 to 200 atm.  If the reaction temperature is lower than 80?, the polymer can be hardly produced because the reaction would not occur due to precipitation or insufficient dispersion of the reactants.  If it exceeds 210?, it is impossible to prepare the polymer having predetermined molecular weight.  If the pressure is not within the above mentioned range, it is difficult to obtain the polymer having the molecular weight desired.<br>
Thereafter, in stage (b), the polymer prepared from stage (a) is copolymerized with a-olefin in the presence of the same catalyst or catalyst composition used for stage (a) at a temperature from 90 to 220?, more preferably from 120 to 200?, under the same pressure as in stage (a).  If the temperature is lower than 90?, polymer may be precipitated, or similar polymer to that obtained from stage (a) is prepared to eliminate the effect of multi-stage polymerization.  If the temperature exceeds 220?, the molecular weight of the polymer becomes too low to impair its physical properties.  With regard to the pressure, corresponding results are obtained as in stage (a).<br>
In the meanwhile, the present invention aims at control of physical properties of ethylene copolymer having uniform molecular weight and multi-modal density distribution by means of different process conditions such as amount of ethylene or hydrogen incorporated in stage (a) or (b), and conversion.  Particularly, it is intended to improve the physical properties of final resin such as tensile strength and impact strength by optimizing tie molecules in the molecular structure by means of predetermined ratio of high molecular, low-density polymer in stage (a).  In stage (b) after (a), same catalyst of catalyst composition is used but the polymerization is performed at a higher temperature to provide ethylene copolymer having different range of molecular weight and density from the polymer prepared in stage (a).  Due to the features of the transition metal catalyst according to the invention, the resultant polymer could not help exhibiting narrow molecular weight distribution and density distribution.  However, broad molecular weight and density distribution as desired by the manufacturer can be obtained by control through the multi-stage reaction.<br>
Throughout the multi-stage reaction, arrangement of the reactors may be in series or in parallel.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of reactors arranged in series, according to one preferable embodiment of the present invention.  As referring to Fig. 1, the reactors in series include a stage-1 feed pump (11), a stage-1 feed cooler (12), a feed heater (13) of stage-1 reactor, a stage-1 low-temperature reactor (14), a catalyst feed (15) of stage-1 low-temperature reactor, a stage-2 high-temperature reactor connected in series (16), a catalyst feed (17) of stage-2 high-temperature reactor, a feed pump (18) of stage-2 reactor, a feed cooler (19) of stage-2 reactor, a feed heater (20) of stage-2 reactor, a feed (21) of stage-2 reactor and a hydrogen feed (22).<br>
Thus, the reaction in series according to the invention comprises feeding the reactants excluding catalyst to the stage-1 low-temperature reactor (14), which is equipped with a temperature controller and includes the feed cooler (12) of stage-1 reactor and the feed heater (13) of stage-1 reactor through the feed pump (11) of stage-1 reactor; feeding the catalyst through the catalyst feed (15) of stage-1 low-temperature reactor; and carrying out stage (a) at a lower temperature than that of stage-2.  The polymer obtained via stage (a) is directly fed to the stage-2 high-temperature reactor connected in series (16) equipped with a feed cooler (19) of stage-2 reactor and a feed heater (20) of stage-2 reactor; the catalyst is fed through the catalyst feed (17) of stage-2 high-temperature reactor; and the reactants to the stage-2 reactor feed (21) through the feed pump (18) of stage-2 reactor, and hydrogen through the hydrogen feed (22); and polymerization of stage (b) is carried out at a higher temperature than that of stage (a).  For the reactors connected in series, the overall reactor system has to be designed and controlled by considering ethylene conversion and catalytic activity in stage-1 reaction.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view of reactors arranged in parallel, according to one preferable embodiment of the present invention.  As referring to Fig. 2, the reactors in parallel include a feed pump (31) of low-temperature reactor, a feed pump (32) of high-temperature reactor, a feed cooler (33) of low-temperature reactor, a feed heater (34) of low-temperature reactor, a feed cooler (35) of high-temperature reactor, a feed heater (36) of high-temperature reactor, a low-temperature reactor (37), a catalyst feed (38) of low-temperature reactor, a catalyst feed (39) of high-temperature reactor, a high-temperature reactor (40), an in-line mixer (41), a feed (42) of the high temperature reactor, and a hydrogen feed (43).<br>
Thus, stage (a) of the reaction in reactors in parallel is carried out by feeding the reactants (excluding catalyst) through the feed pump (31) of the low-temperature reactor to the low temperature reactor (37) (in which temperature is controlled by the feed cooler (33) of the low temperature reactor and the feed heater (34) of the low temperature reactor); and adding catalyst through the catalyst feed (38) of the low temperature reactor.<br>
Separately from stage (a), reaction is carried out at a higher temperature than that of stage (a), by feeding the reactants (excluding catalyst) through the feed pump (32) of the high-temperature reactor to the high temperature reactor (40) (in which temperature is controlled by the feed cooler (35) of the high temperature reactor and the feed heater (36) of the high temperature reactor), and then through the feed (42) of the high temperature reactor, together with hydrogen feed (43); and adding catalyst through the catalyst feed (39) of the high temperature reactor.  The low temperature and high temperature reactants are mixed in the in-line mixer (41) to give homogeneous copolymer.  <br>
For the reaction in such reactors in parallel, an in-line mixer is used for homogeneous mixing of the solution from each reactor, in order to provide uniform physical properties of the copolymer.  For the purpose of obtaining homogeneous copolymer, any possible unit such as stirred tank as well as an in-line mixer may be employed.<br>
In stages (a) and (b) of the present invention, preferable amounts of ethylene and one or more C3-C18 a-olefin comonomer are 60~99% by weight of ethylene and 1~40% by weight of a-olefin comonomer, respectively.  When ethylene content is lower than 60%, physical properties become poor since the desired properties of ethylene do not appear because of the low ethylene content.  If it is higher than 99% by weight, effect of copolymer would be lowered.<br>
In stages (a) and (b), specific examples of C3-C18 a-olefin comonomer include propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene and mixtures thereof.  Among them, more preferable are 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or 1-decene.<br>
In stages (a) and (b), preferable organic solvent for polymerization is C30-C20 hydrocarbon.  Specific examples of solvent include butane, isobutene, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, nonane, decane, dodecane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like.  Examples of commercially available solvent suitable for the process are solvent of SK-ISOL series, a type of isoparaffin solvent.  For example, SK-ISOL E (available from SK Energy) is C8~C12 aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent having the distillation range of 117~137?.<br>
Ethylene copolymers prepared according to the process in accordance with the invention is characterized in that they comprise 10~70% by weight of the polymer prepared from stage (a) and 30~90% by weight of the polymer prepared from stage (b); and the polymer from stage (a) has MI of 0.001 to 2.0 g/10 min and density of 0.860 to 0.925 g/cm3, and the polymer from stage (b) is ethylene copolymer having MI of 0.1 to 100.0 g/10 min and density of 0.900 to 0.970 g/cm3.<br>
First, the polymer prepared from stage (a) is contained in an amount of 10~70% by weight, preferably 20~60% by weight.  If the polymer content from stage (a) is lower than 10% by weight, improvement in impact strength would not occur.  If the content exceeds 70% by weight, transparency is noticeably deteriorated when being processed into film, so that high energy is required for processing, with low productivity.<br>
Molecular weight of the polymer prepared from stage (a), which is based on measurement of MI (melt index) according to ASTM D2839, is MI of 0.001 to 2.0 g/10 min, more preferably from 0.005 to 1.0 g/10 min.  If MI of the polymer prepared from stage (a) is less than 0.001 g/10 min, the polymer prepared would be too stiff to result in poor processibility.  If it is higher than 2.0 g/10 min, noticeable improvement would not appear in overall physical property of the polymer such as tensile strength and impact strength.  According to the report of Tetsuya, Yoshigio, Takagi Hatori et al., ‘High Performance PE100 Resin with Extraordinary Resistance of Slow Crack Growth’, Plastics Pipes XIII Conference, 2007, it is advantageous to preferentially polymerize the portion of higher molecular weight in order to obtain better dispersion of the portion throughout overall resin, in a multi-stage process for preparing ethylene copolymer with multi-modal molecular weight distribution.<br>
Density of the polymer produced from stage (a) is from 0.860 to 0.925 g/cm3, more preferably from 0.880 to 0.915 g/cm3.  If the density is lower than 0.860 g/cm3, the film prepared would have poor physical properties.  If it exceeds 0.925 cm3, the film would be too stiff.  The polymer prepared from stage (a) would be resin having low density range.  This is to improve the physical properties of finally produced resin by synthesizing resin with uniform copolymerization comonomer distribution in the polymer chain by means of transition metal catalyst with single site, differently from Ziegler-Natta catalyst which provides heterogeneous copolymer distribution in the polymer chain.<br>
On the other hand, the polymer prepared from stage (b) is contained in an amount of 30~90% by weight, more preferably 40~80% by weight.  If the polymer content from stage (b) is lower than 30% by weight, processibility of final resin (owing to the high molecular weight, low density ethylene copolymer prepared from stage (a)) and transparency of the film become poor.  If the content exceeds 90% by weight, content of the polymer prepared from stage (a) (which provides good physical properties) becomes low, thereby resulting in lowered environmental resistance, impact strength, tensile strength of the resin.<br>
Molecular weight of the polymer prepared from stage (b), which is based on measurement of MI (melt index) according to ASTM D2839, is MI of 0.1 to 100.0 g/10 min, more preferably from 0.3 to 50.0 g/10 min.  If MI of the polymer prepared from stage (b) is less than 0.1 g/10 min, the molecular weight range is overlapped with the polymer prepared from stage (a), so that the molecular weight distribution would not be broad enough to achieve advantage of multi-stage reaction.  If it exceeds 100 g/10 min, the physical properties would become poor because of low molecular weight.<br>
Density of the polymer produced from stage (b) is preferably from 0.900 to 0.970 g/cm3.  If the density is lower than 0.900 g/cm3, the density is covered by the density range of the polymer prepared from stage (a), so that the effect of stepwise polymerization would be eliminated.  If it exceeds 0.970 cm3, it would be troublesome because the film prepared therefrom is too stiff.  Thus, the density range of the polymer prepared from stage (a) and that of the polymer from stage (b) should be adjusted to optimize the physical properties of the resin.<br>
The ethylene copolymer prepared according to the inventive process include linear low density polyethylene copolymer (LLDPE) having the density of 0.910~0.940 g/cm3, and very low density polyethylene copolymer (VLDPE or ULDPE) having the density of 0.900~0.910 g/cm3.<br>
The ethylene copolymer prepared according to the inventive process has the molecular weight distribution index of 2.8~30.0.<br>
The present invention is designed to improve processibility of ethylene copolymer prepared by using conventional single site catalyst (characterized by narrow molecular weight distribution), due to at least bimodal molecular weight distribution of the polymer through the multi-stage reaction process.  For this, the molecular weight distribution index (weight average molecular weight divided by number average molecular weight) of the ethylene copolymer prepared by using the process and catalyst according to the invention is controlled to be in the range from 2.8 to 30.0, in order to improve processibility as well as physical properties.<br>
Thus, the ethylene copolymers prepared through stage (a) and (b) described above may be those having the molecular weight distribution index of 2.8~3.0, preferably 3.0~20.  When the molecular weight distribution index is within the range, processibility or physical properties of ethylene copolymer can be suitably controlled as desired.  If the molecular weight distribution index is less than 2.8, there would be no significant difference when using a single reactor and single site catalyst.  If it exceeds 30.0, effect of controlling density and molecular weight distribution index disappears to result in poor improvement in processibility or physical properties.<br>
According to the present invention, ethylene and C3-C18 a-olefin comonomer (which are fed to stage (a) or (b)) are dissolved in solvent before being fed to the reactor.  Before mixing and dissolving, ethylene, comonomer and solvent are subjected to purification process to remove impurities including moisture, oxygen, carbon monoxide and other metallic impurities (which may act as potential catalyst poison).  Substances to be used in such purification include molecular sieves, activated aluminum, and silica gel as well known in the corresponding field.<br>
The substances to be incorporated to stage (a) and (b) are cooled or heated through heat exchange process before feeding.  The temperature inside the reactor is controlled through this process.  Thus, temperature control of the reactor is an adiabatic reactor process without heat exchange through the reactor wall.  Control of reaction heat alters the temperature of solvent stream into the reactor and that of the monomer flow.<br>
After stage (b), ethylene, comonomer, catalyst or solvent may be additionally fed according to the invention.  Temperature of these components is also controlled to predetermined temperature via heat exchange.  In general, catalyst is fed separately from other substances, preferably being previously mixed or dissolved with/in solvent.<br>
Molecular weight and density of the stage are analyzed after stage (b) [when the polymer is prepared via two- or multi-stage reaction]; or physical properties of polymers prepared via further stages are analyzed by sampling the resin after stage (a), and those of finally produced polymer after stage (b) are analyzed, so that density, molecular weight of the polymers, and the like are calculated in every stage.<br>
For measuring physical properties, they can be analogized by the physical properties of the polymer obtained by carrying out the reaction of each stage in a single reactor under identical polymerization condition (such as temperature and pressure, solvent, reactants, catalyst and reaction time).  Otherwise, physical properties of the polymer synthesized in each stage can be analyzed by sampling and analyzing samples in the reactor of each stage in the multi-stage reaction.	In the meanwhile, residence time in stage (a) or (b) is determined by the designed volume and output per time for each stage.  In order to maintain the operation condition with homogeneity of the substances, appropriate stirring is required for stage (a) and (b).  Finally prepared ethylene polymer or ethylene copolymer is recovered through appropriate process for removing solvent.<br><br>
?Advantageous Effects?<br>
	The ethylene copolymers having multi-modal molecular weight distribution according to the present invention, which is prepared via multi-stage synthesis of ethylene or a-olefin, show the effect of improved physical properties as well as processibility.<br>
	The process according to the invention provides high productivity and various usage with overcoming the disadvantages resulted from blending with other polymer(s). <br>
From the ethylene copolymers prepared via stages (a) and (b), obtained can be molded articles used as blown film, casting film, injection molding, blow molding or pipe.<br>
The film can be formed as blown film or casting film to provide mono-layer or multi-layer film for package.  They can be applied to the use for shrinkage film, film for heavy package, film for freeze package, film for automatic package, stretch wrap, bags, or the like.<br><br>

?Best Mode?<br>
	Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples, which are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention. <br>
Unless being stated otherwise, all experiments for synthesizing the ligands and catalysts were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere with standard Schlenk or glove-box technique, and the organic solvents were used after they had been dried via reflux over sodium metal and benzophenone, and then distilled immediately before use.  1H-NMR analyses of the ligands and catalysts thus synthesized were performed by using Varian Mercury 300 MHz Spectrometer at ambient temperature.<br>
As the solvent for polymerization, cyclohexane was passed through a tube filled with Q-5 catalyst (from BASF), silica gel and activated alumina, sequentially, and bubbled by nitrogen with high purity to sufficiently remove moisture, oxygen and other catalyst poison.  <br>

All procedures relevant to Examples were carried out by means of continuous solution polymerization process as described below.  In the process, flow of any solvent, monomer, catalyst, or the like was continuously provided.  The reaction products including polymers, isolated solvent and unreacted substances were also removed continuously.  All feed flows were passed through conventionally known adsorption media before being fed into the reactor to increase purity.  During this procedure, impurities (water, oxygen, carbon monoxide, or the like) as catalyst poison are removed.  All starting materials are stored and used under nitrogen atmosphere of high purity.<br>
The polymerization process according to the invention is carried out in two reactors sequentially connected in series, or in two reactors connected in parallel.  In case of connection in series, a first reactor has inner volume of 500 mL, and sequentially connected to a second reactor of volume of 1000 mL through pipe.  In case of connection in parallel, a 500 mL reactor is connected to a 650 mL reactor.  Each reactor is designed so that solvent, monomers, comonomers, hydrogen and catalyst may be fed into it.<br>
Catalyst to be fed to the reactor according to the invention is catalyst composition containing single site catalyst represented by Chemical Formula (1), and the catalyst is commonly applied to reactions in the first and second stages of all Examples.<br>
As cocatalyst, boron-containing ion activator and aluminoxane is used according to the present invention.  Specifically, triisobutylaluminum was optionally used as aluminoxane, and triphenylmethyliniumtetrakispentafluorophenyl borate as ion activator, in the Examples.  Catalyst and cocatalyst were fed to the first and second reactor as their solution dissolved in toluene.<br>
The polymerization process according to the invention is carried out in cyclohexane solvent under pressure of 110 kgf/cm2.  Ethylene is dissolved in cyclohexane, prior to be fed to the polymerization reactor, at a temperature of 23? under a pressure of 30 kgf/cm2.  Comonomer, together with ethylene, is also dissolved in solvent prior to be fed to the polymerization reactor.  As the reaction proceeds, ethylene conversion is controlled by means of catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, catalytic activity, and the like.<br><br>

When the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was filtered through celite, and the solvent was removed.  Recrystallization from purified toluene and hexane at -35?, followed by filtration and drying under reduced pressure gave (dichloro)(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(1-phenylnaphthalen-2-yloxy)titanium(IV) (2.5 g)(yield: 58.2%) as red solid.<br>

Example 1<br>
As single site catalyst for stage-1 and stage-2 reactors connected in series, employed was bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(2-phenyl-4-fluorophenoxy)titanium(IV) chloride prepared from Preparation Example 1.  The amounts of catalyst used in Examples and Comparative Examples are shown in Table 1 and 2.  Ti represents single site catalyst, Al represents triisobutylaluminum as cocatalyst, and B represents triphenylmethyliniumtetrakispentafluorophenyl borate.  Each catalyst was dissolved in xylene at a concentration of 0.2 g/L, 5.0 g/L or 1.5 g/L.  For each reactor, ethylene feed ratio was 4:6, and 1-octene was used as comonomer.  However, the amount of ethylene to be fed to the stage-2 reactor should be determined, when the conversion is low, as considering the amount of unreacted ethylene flowing into the second reactor, in order to adjust the polymer density and molecular weight from the first reactor.  Conversion of each reactor can be estimated for individual reaction condition, through the reaction condition for polymerizing one type of polymer, and temperature gradient in the reactor.  In order to produce copolymer with relatively high MI in the second reactor, an appropriate amount of hydrogen was injected to control the molecular weight.  Furthermore, molecular weight from each reactor may be controlled as a function of the reactor temperature and 1-octene content, of which the conditions are shown in Table 1-1.<br>

Tables 1-1, 1-2 and 2 show the polymerization conditions and physical properties of polymers produced under individual condition in Examples 1 to 11 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5.  In Tables 1-1, 1-2 and 2, it was confirmed that the polymer prepared by using single site catalyst in 2-stage reaction process showed broad molecular weight distribution of 3 or more.  A few limited examples of the catalysts according to the invention clearly show the features of single site catalysts, in spite of some differences in degree of comonomer coupling and activity.  It is found that the copolymers prepared according to the process proposed by the invention show more excellent physical properties that those of conventional products.<br>
Table 3 shows the physical properties of films prepared in Examples 1 to 6, 8 to 11, and Comparative Examples 1 and 2.  It is found that most of the physical properties of the films according to the invention were improved in spite of similar level of MI and density.  In particular, the processing load of the extruder was significantly decreased due to broader molecular weight distribution, which would achieve saving of energy consumption and enhanced production rate upon manufacturing.<br>
In Examples 1, 2, 3, 8 and 10, and Comparative Example 2, resins synthesized by using different metallocene catalysts through the same process were analyzed, and blown films processed therefrom were compared.  The metallocene catalyst used in Comparative Example 2 does not fall under the scope of the metallocene catalyst according to the present invention.  The ethylene copolymer prepared through the first reactor by using the catalyst does not provide high molecular weight resin at corresponding reaction temperature, and blown films thus prepared show large differences in physical properties as compared to the resins from Examples 1, 2, 3, 8 and 10.<br>
The effect of the present invention is revealed when comparing the blown film prepared according to the present invention (Examples 1~3, 8, 10) to the film from conventional product (FN810 Grade from SK Energy) (Comparative Example 3).  Examples 1~3, 8 and 10 shows much improvement in terms of impact strength and heat seal, due to different proportion of high molecular weight, low density section produced from Reactor.<br>
In Examples 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, and Comparative Example 4, resins corresponding to representative MI and density of casting film synthesized according to the process of the invention, and conventional product (FT810 Grade from SK Energy) were subjected to polymer analysis, and tested in terms of physical properties after being processed as film.<br>
Table 4 shows the test results of the pipe prepared from Example 7 and Comparative Example 5.  In order to examine the improvement in physical properties of pipe, measured was slow crack growth at 80? according to ISO 13479, as described above.   Polymers from Example 7 and from Comparative Example 5 were individually processed as pipe having outer diameter of 16 mm and thickeness of 1.45 mm, and hoop stress of 5.5 MPa and 5.65 MPa, respectively, were applied thereto at 80?.  The time duration up to breakage is recorded.  <br>
As can be seen from Table 4, the pipe prepared from Example 7, wherein high molecular weight, low density section is added to the stage-1 reactor, showed enhanced durability.<br><br>
Though the present invention is described in detail with referring to Examples as above and drawings accompanied, a person having ordinary skill in the art in the field of industry to which the invention belongs can make various replacement, modification or alteration without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention, which was defined by appended claims.<br><br>
?Industrial Applicability?<br>
