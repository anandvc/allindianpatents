				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an unsupported, solid metallocene<br>
olefin polymerisation catalyst, to the use of the catalyst in olefin polymerisation and to the<br>
catalyst perse.<br>
In particular, the invention describes the use of an aluminoxane co-catalyst and a compound,<br>
which can dissociate or partially dissociate into cationic and anionic species (M-X species),<br>
to form a solution which is then subsequently reacted with a metallocene complex to form the<br>
catalyst species by emulsion/solidification technology.<br>
Many catalysts and processes are known for the preparation of olefin polymers. Ziegler-Natta<br>
(ZN) catalyst compositions and chromium oxide compounds have, for example, been found<br>
to be useful in the preparation of polyolefins.<br>
Further the use of single-site (e.g. metallocene) catalysts in olefin polymerisation has been<br>
known for many years and has been found to afford polymer properties not easily available<br>
by using ZN catalysts.<br>
Metallocene compounds/procatalysts are conventionally activated using a cocatalyst such as<br>
an alumoxane known from the literature to form the active metallocene catalyst species.<br>
The first single-site catalysts to be developed were homogeneous, i.e. they were used in<br>
solution in the polymerisation reaction. Due to the many drawbacks of homogeneous<br>
solution systems, several different approaches have been used to try to overcome the<br>
problems of the solution catalyst systems. Nowadays the most commonly used catalyst<br>
systems comprise heterogeneous catalysts, wherein catalyst components are supported on<br>
an external carrier. Such catalyst systems are described for example by Severn et al., Chem.<br>
Rev. 2005; 105(11); 4073-4147 or in the Handbook Tailor-Made Polymers: Via<br>
Immobilization of Alpha-Olefin Polymerization Catalysts of Severn et al..<br>
The carriers used have a porous structure in order to facilitate catalyst impregnation into the<br>
support. Carrier materials are typically polymeric or inorganic supports, most typically silica,<br>
alumina or magnesium dichloride based materials.<br>
However, even the catalysts supported on external carriers have their drawbacks. The main<br>
drawbacks concern the inhomogeneity of the resulting catalyst. From the point of view of<br>
catalyst and polymer properties, one of the most important drawbacks of this kind of<br>
heterogeneous catalyst system is that it is difficult or even impossible to get solid catalyst<br>
particles, wherein the catalyst components are evenly distributed thorough the catalyst<br>
support. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity problem also exists between catalyst particles, i.e.<br>
intra- and inter-particle inhomogeneity problems occur. This is significant as the morphology<br>
of the support or carrier material has an essential effect on the catalyst and, due to the<br>
replica effect, also on the polymer morphology. Thus, any variations in catalyst distribution<br>
and morphology lead to differences in catalytic behavior in polymerisation and result in<br>
inconsistencies in the polymer product. In addition, use of an. external support involves<br>
additional costs, the quality of the support must be carefully controlled, leaching of the<br>
catalyst components from the support can occur and still sometimes carrier residues might<br>
cause some problems.<br>
A catalyst providing the advantages of both homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts is<br>
clearly desirable. Whilst it was generally believed that it is very difficult to obtain good<br>
polymer particle morphology using an olefin catalyst, which is not supported on an external<br>
support, it was previously found that polymers having a good particle morphology may be<br>
obtained using such a catalyst, which is in the form of solid particles (but in which an external<br>
carrier or support is absent). For example, WO 03/051934 and WO2006/069733, the<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe such catalysts and<br>
processes comprising an emulsion/solidification technology for producing them. The<br>
preparation of this kind of catalysts is based on a liquid/liquid emulsion system comprising at<br>
least two phases, from which the catalyst particles forming the dispersed phase of the<br>
emulsion are solidified.<br>
Furthermore pre-polymerisation has been used widely in the past in order to attempt to<br>
control the powder morphology of the resulting polymer product.<br>
Unfortunately, prepolymerisation conditions have to be optimized for each single catalyst<br>
extra to ensure desirable polymer morphology. In addition, prepolymerisation is expensive on<br>
a commercial scale due in part to the need for additional reactor hardware, solvents, and<br>
monomer.<br>
Further methods known in the art to obtain polymer product having uniform, compact<br>
spherical particles include: pre-activating or pre-contacting the metallocene and aluminoxane<br>
(EP 0 302 424, EP 0 354 893), utilizing finely divided alumoxane to yield a powdery<br>
polymer (e.g. EP 0 279 586) and utilizing a supported catalyst system and fillers in the<br>
catalyst system with affinities for polyolefins (e.g. EP 0 314 797).<br>
Nevertheless, these techniques suffer due to either unacceptable levels of reactor fouling<br>
which occur during polymerisation, low catalyst activity or producing a polymer with poor<br>
morphology.<br>
Accordingly much development work has been done to improve the morphology properties of<br>
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the complexity of the catalyst<br>
systems there is a continuous need for alternative or improved methods of preparing<br>
unsupported, solid metallocene catalysts by using the emulsion/solidification technology,<br>
which allow an improved control of the catalyst morphology and yield catalysts with improved<br>
productivity.<br>
It has been surprisingly found by the inventors of the present invention that catalyst particles<br>
having excellent morphology and improved productivity can be obtained by the<br>
emulsion/solidification technology if an aluminoxane co-catalyst and a compound, which can<br>
dissociate or partially dissociate into cationic and anionic species (M-X species), is used to<br>
form a solution which is then subsequently reacted with a metallocene complex to form the<br>
catalyst species.<br>
The produced catalyst particles according to the invention have excellent morphology and<br>
yield polymerisation catalysts having improved activity and productivity. According to the<br>
replica effect, the polymer particles produced by using the inventive catalyst have very good<br>
morphological properties, too. The inventive catalyst preparation is based on a liquid/liquid<br>
two-phase system where no separate external carrier materials such as silica or MgCI2 are<br>
needed in order to get solid catalyst particles.<br>
Thus in a first aspect, the present invention is therefore directed to a process for the<br>
preparation of an unsupported, heterogeneous metallocene olefin polymerisation catalyst,<br>
comprising an organometallic compound of a transition metal of Group 3 to 10 of the Periodic<br>
Table (IUPAC 2007) or of an actinide or lanthanide in the form of solid particles comprising<br>
the steps of<br>
a) preparing a solution of an aluminoxane and an ionic complex M-X, M being an alkali<br>
or alkaline earth metal and X being a halide or pseudo halide, in a molar ratio of Al of<br>
the aluminoxane to M of the ionic complex between 80:1 and 300:1,<br>
b) mixing said solution with an organometallic compound of a transition metal of Group 3<br>
to 10 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC 2007) or of an actinide or lanthanide in a molar<br>
ratio of M of the ionic complex to the transition metal of the organometallic compound<br>
between 1:1 and 4:1, yielding a second solution,<br>
c) dispersing said second solution obtained in step b) in a solvent immiscible therewith<br>
to form an emulsion in which said second solution of step b) forms the dispersed<br>
phase in the form of droplets and the solvent immiscible with said solution forms the<br>
continuous phase,<br>
d) solidifying said dispersed phase to convert said droplets to solid particles and<br>
optionally recovering said particles to obtain said catalyst.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a catalyst obtainable by, e.g. obtained by,<br>
a process as hereinbefore described.<br>
Viewed from yet another aspect the invention provides the use of a catalyst as hereinbefore<br>
described in olefin polymerisation.<br>
Viewed from still further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
polyolefins comprising polymerising at least one olefin in the presence of an olefin<br>
polymerisation catalyst as hereinbefore described.<br>
In the first step of the process according to the invention a solution of an aluminoxane and an<br>
ionic complex M-X is formed.<br>
The aluminoxane employed in step a) can be any conventional aluminoxane as is known in<br>
the art.<br>
Aluminoxanes are commercially available or can be prepared according to prior art literature<br>
for example by the hydrolysis of aluminium alkyls either by direct water addition or by<br>
treatment with salt hydrates. There are a variety of methods for preparing aluminoxane and<br>
modified aluminoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463,<br>
4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793,<br>
5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451 5,744,656 and European publications EP-A-0<br>
561 476, EP-B1-0 279 586 and EP-A-0 594-218, and WO 94/10180, all of which are herein<br>
fully incorporated by reference.<br>
Aluminoxanes are also called alumoxanes.<br>
Preferably, CrCio-alkylalumoxanes, particularly methylalumoxane or modified<br>
methylalumoxane, isobutylalumoxane, e.g. TIBAO (tetraisobutylalumoxane) or HIBAO<br>
(hexaisobutylalumoxane) are used for step a). More preferably methylalumoxane (MAO) is<br>
used.<br>
Most preferably MAO commercially available as 5 to 30 wt% solution in an aromatic solvent,<br>
typically toluene is used.<br>
The second compound used in step a) is an ionic complex M-X.<br>
Ionic complexes M-X are compounds which can potentially dissociate or partially dissociate<br>
into cationic (M+) and anionic components (X).<br>
M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal, like Na, K, Li, Mg or Ca.<br>
X is a halide, like F, Cl or Br, or a pseudohalide.<br>
The term pseudohalide refers to moieties which are not halides but are generally considered<br>
to be a good leaving group in substitution reaction. Pseudohalides can include, for example,<br>
azides, cyanide, cyanate, thiocyanate, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, silicon groups, sulfur<br>
groups, nitrogen groups, oxygen groups, boron groups and phosphorous groups.<br>
Non-limiting examples are alkali and alkaline earth halides or pseudo-halides such as LiCI,<br>
KCI, KF, NaF, CaCI2, MgCI2, MgF2, KOSiR3 or NaBO4.<br>
The molar ratio of aluminium, provided by the aluminoxane, and M (cationic moiety),<br>
provided by the M-X compound is in the range of 80:1 to 300:1, preferably from 100:1 to<br>
250:1 and more preferably from 120:1 to 200:1<br>
Preferably a solvent, more preferably an organic solvent is used to form the solution of step<br>
a). Still more preferably the organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of linear or<br>
cyclic alkanes, linear or cyclic alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogen-containing<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
Examples of aromatic hydrocarbons are toluene, benzene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene<br>
mesitylene or cymene. The preferred solvent used is toluene.<br>
The solution in step a) may comprise one or more solvents. A mixture of solvents may be<br>
used in step a), provided that said mixture dissolves the aluminoxane and the M-X ionic<br>
complex mixed in step a) and the organometallic compound added in step b) and is<br>
immiscible, as defined below, with the continuous phase at least during the emulsion forming<br>
step c).<br>
The solution of step a) is formed at a temperature between 10 and 35°C, preferably between<br>
15 and 30°C and more preferably between 20 and 25°C.<br>
The solution obtained in step a) is then further mixed with an organometallic compound of a<br>
transition metal of Group 3 to 10 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC 2007) or of an actinide or<br>
lanthanide (step b).<br>

Alternatively, in a further subgroup of the metallocene compounds, the metal bears a Cp<br>
group as defined above and additionally a r)1 or rf ligand, wherein said ligands may or may<br>
not be bridged to each other. This subgroup includes so called "scorpionate compounds"<br>
(with constrained geometry) in which the metal is complexed by a rf ligand bridged to a q1 or<br>
if ligand, preferably n,1 (for example a sigma-bonded) ligand, e.g. a metal complex of a Cp<br>
group as defined above, e.g. a cyclopentadienyl group, which bears, via a bridge member,<br>
an acyclic or cyclic group containing at least one heteroatom, e.g. -NR"2 as defined above.<br>
Such compounds are described e.g. in WO-A-96/13529, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Any alky I, alkenyl or alkynyl residue referred above alone or as a part of a moiety may be<br>
linear or branched, and contain preferably of up to 9, e.g. of up to 6, carbon atoms. Aryl is<br>
preferably phenyl or naphthalene. Halogen means F, Cl, Br or I, preferably Cl.<br>
Another subgroup of the organotransition metal compounds of formula (I) usable in the<br>
present invention is known as non-metallocenes wherein the transition metal (preferably a<br>
Group 4 to 6 transition metal, suitably Ti, Zr or Hf) has a coordination ligand other than<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand.<br>
The term "non-metallocene"' herein means compounds, which bear no cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligands or fused derivatives thereof, but one or more non-cyclopentadienyl n- or a-, mono-,<br>
bi- or multidentate ligand. Such ligands can be chosen e.g. from (a) acyclic, n1- to n4- or n.6-<br>
ligands composed of atoms from Groups 13 to 16 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC), e.g. an<br>
acyclic pentadienyl ligand wherein the chain consists of carbon atoms and optionally one or<br>
more heteroatoms from Groups 13 to 16 (IUPAC), and in which the open chain ligand may<br>
be fused with one or two, preferably two, aromatic or non-aromatic rings and/or bear further<br>
substituents (see e.g. WO 01/70395, WO 97/10248 and WO 99/41290), or (b) cyclic a-, n1- to<br>
H4- or n,6-, mono-, bi- or multidentate ligands composed of unsubstituted or substituted mono-<br>
, bi- or multicyclic ring systems, e.g. aromatic or non-aromatic or partially saturated ring<br>
systems, containing carbon ring atoms and optionally one or more heteroatoms selected<br>
from Groups 15 and 16 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC) (see e.g. WO 99/10353). Bi- or<br>
multidentate ring systems include also bridged ring systems wherein each ring is linked via a<br>
bridging group, e.g. via an atom from Groups 15 or 16 of the Periodic Table, e.g. N, O or S,<br>
to the transition metal atom (see e.g. WO 02/060963). As examples of such compounds, i.e.<br>
transition metal complexes with nitrogen-based, cyclic or acyclic aliphatic or aromatic<br>
ligands, e.g. such as those described in the applicants earlier application WO-A-99/10353 or<br>
in the Review of V.C. Gibson at al., in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., engl., Vol 38, 1999, pp 428-<br>
447 and V.C. Gibson and S.K. Spitzmesser, in Chem. Rev. 2003; 103(1); pp 283-316; or with<br>
oxygen-based ligands, such as Group 4 metal complexes bearing bidentate cyclic or acyclic<br>
aliphatic or aromatic alkoxide ligands, e.g. optionally substituted, bridged bisphenolic ligands<br>
(see i.e. the above review of Gibson et al.). Further specific examples of non-n5 ligands are<br>
amides, amide-diphosphane, amidinato, aminopyridinate, benzamidinate, azacycloalkenyl,<br>
such as triazabicycloalkenyl, allyl, beta-diketimate and aryl oxide. The disclosures of the<br>
above documents are incorporated herein by reference. It should be noted that the diversity<br>
does not affect the applicability of the process of the invention.<br>
The preparation of metallocenes and non-metallocenes, and the organic ligands thereof,<br>
usable in the invention is well documented in the prior art, and reference is made e.g. to the<br>
above cited documents. Some of said compounds are also commercially available. Thus,<br>
said transition metal compounds can be prepared according to or analogously to the<br>
methods described in the literature, e.g. by first preparing the organic ligand moiety and then<br>
metallating said organic ligand (n-ligand) with a transition metal. Alternatively, a metal ion of<br>
an existing metallocene can be exchanged for another metal ion through transmetallation.<br>
If several different transition metal compounds are used (mixed dual or multicatalyst<br>
systems), these can be any combinations of the above organometal compounds or of the<br>
above organometal compounds with other catalyst compounds (including Ziegler-Natta and<br>
chromium oxide systems), e.g. a combination at least of two or more a metallocenes, of a<br>
metallocene and a non-metallocene, as well as of a metallocene and/or a non-metallocene<br>
with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system (which comprises typically a transition metal compound<br>
and a compound of a metal from Group 2 of the Periodic Table, such as a Mg compound).<br>
The molar ratio of aluminium, provided by the aluminoxane, and the transition metal T is in<br>
the range of 1:1 to 10 000:1, preferably from 5:1 to 8 000:1, more preferably from 10:1 to<br>
7 000:1, e.g. 100:1 to 4 000:1.<br>
Typically in case of solid (heterogeneous) catalysts the ratio is from 10:1 to 1000:1, such as<br>
100:1 to 500:1.<br>
The quantity of aluminoxane cocatalyst to be employed in the catalyst of the invention is thus<br>
variable and depends on the conditions and the particular transition metal compound chosen<br>
in a manner well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The molar ratio of M provided by the M-X compound and the transition metal T is in the<br>
range of 1:1 to 4:1, preferably 1.5:1 to 3:1 and more preferably 1.8:1 to 2.5:1<br>
Step b) is performed at a temperature between 10 and 35°C, preferably between 15 and<br>
30°C and more preferably between 20 and 25°C.<br>
In step c) the aluminoxane/M-X/organotransition metal compound containing solution,<br>
obtained in step b) (i.e. the second solution) is then dispersed in a solvent immiscible<br>
therewith to form an emulsion. In this emulsion said second solution of step b) forms the<br>
dispersed phase in the form of droplets and the solvent immiscible with said solution forms<br>
the continuous phase.<br>
The principles for preparing two phase emulsion systems are known in the chemical field.<br>
Thus, in order to form the two phase liquid system, the solution obtained according to step b)<br>
and the solvent used as the continuous liquid phase have to be essentially immiscible at<br>
least during the dispersing step c). This can be achieved in a known manner, as described<br>
for example in WO 03/051934 or WO 2006/069733, e.g. by choosing said two liquids and/or<br>
the temperature of the dispersing step/solidifying step accordingly.<br>
The immiscible solvent forming the continuous phase is an inert solvent and includes<br>
halogenated organic solvents, more preferably the immiscible solvent comprises a<br>
fluorinated organic solvent and/or a functionalized derivative thereof, still more preferably the<br>
immiscible solvent comprises a semi-, highly- or perfluorinated hydrocarbon and/or a<br>
functionalized derivative thereof. It is in particular preferred, that said immiscible solvent<br>
comprises a perfluorohydrocarbon or a functionalized derivative thereof, preferably C3-C30<br>
perfluoroalkanes, -alkenes or -cycloalkanes, more preferred C4-C10 perfluoroalkanes,<br>
-alkenes or -cycloalkanes, particularly preferred perfluorohexane, perfluoroheptane,<br>
perfluorooctane or perfluoro (methylcyclohexane) or a mixture thereof.<br>
Furthermore it is preferred that the emulsion comprising said continuous phase and said<br>
dispersed phase is a bi-or multiphasic system as known in the art.<br>
An emulsifier may be used for forming the emulsion. After the formation of the emulsion<br>
system, said catalyst is formed in situ from catalyst components in said solution.<br>
In principle, the emulsifying agent may be any suitable agent which contributes to the<br>
formation and/or stabilization of the emulsion and which does not have any adverse effect on<br>
the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The emulsifying agent may e.g. be a surfactant based on<br>
hydrocarbons optionally interrupted with (a) heteroatom(s), preferably halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons optionally having a functional group, preferably semi-, highly- or perfluorinated<br>
hydrocarbons as known in the art. Alternatively, the emulsifying agent may be prepared<br>
during the emulsion preparation, e.g. by reacting a surfactant precursor with a compound of<br>
the catalyst solution. Said surfactant precursor may be a halogenated hydrocarbon with at<br>
least one functional group, e.g. a highly fluorinated C1 to C30 alcohol, which reacts e.g. with a<br>
cocatalyst component, such as aluminoxane.<br>
As a reference to the surfactants and surfactant precursor WO 03/051934 or WO<br>
2006/069733 is referred to.<br>
The dispersing step c) can be effected as described, for example, in WO 03/051934 or WO<br>
2006/069733, e.g. by mixing or by the so called phase change method.<br>
Regardless of the method used to form the emulsion, its temperature prior to step d) is -20 to<br>
+50°C, preferably -10 to +40°C, more preferably -5 to 30°C and most preferably 0 to 20°C.<br>
The solidification step d) can also be effected as described, for example, in WO 03/051934<br>
or WO 2006/069733.<br>
In principle any solidification method can be used for forming the solid particles from the<br>
dispersed droplets. According to one preferable embodiment the solidification is effected by a<br>
temperature change treatment. Hence the emulsion subjected to gradual temperature<br>
change of up to 10 °C/min, preferably 0.5 to 6 °C/min and more preferably 1 to 5 °C/min.<br>
Even more preferred the emulsion is subjected to a temperature change of more than 40 °C,<br>
preferably more than 50 °C within less than 10 seconds, preferably less than 6 seconds.<br>
The solid particles formed can be isolated by conventional separation methods.<br>
The recovered particles have preferably an average size range of 5 to 200 um, more<br>
preferably 10 to 100 um.<br>
Moreover, the form of solidified particles have preferably a spherical shape, a predetermined<br>
particles size distribution and a surface area as mentioned above of preferably less than<br>
25 m2/g, still more preferably less than 20 m2/g, yet more preferably less than 15 m2/g, yet<br>
still more preferably less than 10 m2/g and most preferably less than 5 m2/g, wherein said<br>
particles are obtained by the process as described above.<br>
For further details, embodiments and examples of the continuous and dispersed phase<br>
system, emulsion formation method, emulsifying agent and solidification methods reference<br>
is made e.g. to the above cited international patent application WO 03/051934 or WO<br>
2006/069733.<br>
The reaction steps c) and d) may be carried out batch wise or at least one of steps (c) to (d)<br>
of the above catalyst preparation process is carried out in a continuous, rather than in a<br>
batch wise manner.<br>
Details, embodiments and examples for the semi-continuous or continuous process for steps<br>
c) and d) are described for example in WO 2006/069733, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
With the above described preparation method unsupported, solid polymerisation catalysts<br>
having excellent morphology and high activity and productivity are obtained.<br>
Therefore the present invention is also related to an unsupported, solid polymerisation<br>
catalyst having excellent morphology and high activity and productivity, obtainable by a<br>
process as described above.<br>
Furthermore this advantageous catalyst needs no pre-polymerisation step in order to achieve<br>
the desired properties of excellent morphology and high activity and productivity.<br>
The present invention is further related to the use of the above defined polymerisation<br>
catalyst for olefin polymerisation to yield polyolefins and the polyolefins produced with such a<br>
catalyst.<br>
Suitable polyolefins comprise polyethylene and polypropylene homopolymers and also<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene and polypropylene/ethylene copolymers comprising from 0 to 40<br>
wt % C3 to C30-alpha-olefin or C4 to C30-diene-derived units, and more particularly a<br>
copolymer or terpolymer of ethylene and/or propylene with 0 to 10 wt % alkenes, for example<br>
1-propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-pent-1-ene, 1-hexene, cyclohexene, 1-octene and<br>
norbornene, or dienes, for example butadiene, hexadiene oroctadiene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polyolefins produced by using the catalyst according to the<br>
invention are ethylene polymers, which contain as comonomers 0 to 40 wt % C3 to C30-alpha-<br>
olefins, preferably C3 to C10-alpha-olefins, more preferably C3 to C6-alpha-olefins, and most<br>
preferably butene or hexene, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The polyolefin composition further can show unimodal, bimodal or multimodal molecular<br>
weight distribution. Bimodal or multimodal polyolefins can be produced in dual or multi-stage<br>
and -reactor processes which are known in the art and for example are described by F. P. Alt<br>
et al. in MACROMOL. SYMP., 135-143 (2001) and METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS<br>
366-378 (2000); and U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 185, U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 485, U.S. Pat. No. 4 511<br>
704 or in single reactors with the use of a plurality of catalysts.<br>
Any method of olefin polymerisation - for example, a gas phase, slurry phase, solution<br>
polymerisation process or any combinations thereof - that is known for the polymerisation of<br>
olefins to form polyolefins in combination with the catalysts of the invention can be used.<br>
Polymerisation can be a one stage or a two or multistage polymerisation process, carried out<br>
in at least one polymerisation reactor. Multimodal polymers with respect to the molecular<br>
weight distribution (MWD) are produced in a multistage process, where low molecular weight<br>
and higher molecular weight polymers are produced in different polymerisation steps, in any<br>
order. Different combinations for producing multimodal polymers can be used, e.g. gas-gas<br>
phase, slurry-slurry phase, slurry-gas phase processes; slurry-gas phase polymerisation<br>
being a preferred one. Unimodal polymers can be produced in a one stage polymerisation,<br>
although more than one stage is possible, but then polymers with approximately the same<br>
molecular weight are produced in each stage. Any type of polymerisations as listed above<br>
are possible, however, slurry process being one preferred process.<br>
In addition to the actual polymerisation the process configuration can comprise any pre- or<br>
post reactors.<br>
The catalyst according to the invention may be introduced into the polymerisation reactor by<br>
any suitable means regardless of the type of polymerisation reactor used. In one<br>
embodiment, the catalyst is fed to the reactor in a substantially dry state, meaning that the<br>
isolated solid form of the catalyst has not been diluted or combined with a diluent prior to<br>
entering the reactor. In another embodiment, the catalyst is combined with a diluent and fed<br>
to the reactor; the diluent in one embodiment is an alkane, such as a C4 to C20-alkane,<br>
toluene, xylene, mineral or silicon oil, or combinations thereof, such as described in, for<br>
example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745.<br>
Generally the quantity of catalyst used will depend upon the nature of the catalyst, the<br>
reactor types and conditions and the properties desired for the polymer product.<br>
Conventional catalyst quantities, such as described in the publications referred herein, may<br>
be used.<br>
The reactor setup is not particularly limited and can be any reactor setup known to the skilled<br>
person. Suitable types of reactors and means for operating the reactors are for example<br>
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,003,712, 4,588,790, 4,302,566, 5,834,571, 5,352,749,<br>
5,352,749 and 5,462,999, which are all fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
For slurry reactors, e.g. loop reactors, the reaction temperature will generally be in the range<br>
of 50 to 110 °C (e.g. 60 -100, or 70 to 110 °C), the reactor pressure will generally be in the<br>
range of 20 to 80 bar (e.g. 30-70 bar), and the residence time will generally be in the range of<br>
0.3 to 5 hours (e.g. 0.5 to 2 hours). The diluent used will generally be an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon having a boiling point in the range -70 to +100 °C. In such reactors,<br>
polymerisation may if desired be effected under supercritical conditions.<br>
For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature used will generally be in the range of 50 to<br>
130 °C (e.g. 60 to 115 °C, or 60 to 100 °C), the reactor pressure will generally be in the<br>
range of 5 to 60 bar, preferably 10 to 40 bar and the residence time will generally be 1 to 8<br>
hours. The gas used will commonly be a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen together with<br>
monomer.<br>
Hydrogen may be introduced into a reactor to control the molecular weight of the polymer as<br>
is well-known and routine in the art. In one embodiment, the mole ratio of hydrogen to total<br>
olefin monomer in the circulating gas stream is in a range of from 0.001 or 0.002 or 0.003 to<br>
0.014 or 0.016 or 0.018 or 0.024, wherein a desirable range may comprise any combination<br>
of any upper mole ratio limit with any lower mole ratio limit described herein. Expressed<br>
another way, the amount of hydrogen in the reactor at anytime may range from 1000 ppm to<br>
20,000 ppm in one embodiment, and from 2000 to 10,000 in another embodiment, and from<br>
3000 to 8,000 in yet another embodiment, and from 4000 to 7000 in yet another<br>
embodiment, wherein a desirable range may comprise any upper hydrogen limit with any<br>
lower hydrogen limit described herein.<br>
The invention therefore also provides a process for producing a polymer composition<br>
comprising at least (i) an alpha-olefin homo- or copolymer component as defined above,<br>
wherein alpha-olefin monomers, optionally together with one or more comonomers, are<br>
polymerized in the presence of the special catalyst according to the invention.<br>
In case the polymer composition consists of component (i) the process is a single stage<br>
process.<br>
The invention further provides a process for producing a polymer composition comprising at<br>
least two different alpha-olefm homo- or copolymer components (i) and (ii) as defined above<br>
or in claims below, wherein each component is produced by polymerising alpha-olefin<br>
monomers, optionally together with one or more comonomers, in the presence of the<br>
polymerisation catalyst according to the invention in a multistage polymerisation process<br>
using one or more polymerisation reactors, which may be the same or different, e.g. at least<br>
loop-loop, gas-gas or any combination of loop and gas. Each stage may be effected in<br>
parallel or sequentially using same or different polymerisation method. In case of a<br>
sequential stages each components, e.g. (i) and (ii), may be produced in any order by<br>
carrying out the polymerisation in each step, except the first step, in the presence of the<br>
polymer component formed, and preferably the catalyst used, in the preceding step.<br>
Alternatively, the same or different catalyst can be added in the subsequent step(s).<br>
In one embodiment the process for producing any of the above polymer composition<br>
comprising (i) an alpha-olefin homopolymer or copolymer component and, optionally, (ii) an<br>
alpha-olefin homopolymer or copolymer component includes the steps of:<br>
(a) polymerising in a slurry reactor zone, preferably a loop reactor, alpha-olefin monomers,<br>
optionally together with one of more comonomers, in the presence of the catalyst according<br>
to the invention to produce polymer component (i),<br>
and<br>
(b) optionally transferring the reaction product of step (a) to a subsequent gas phase reactor<br>
zone and polymerising alpha-olefin monomers, optionally together with one or more<br>
comonomers, in the presence of the reaction product of step (a) to produce polymer<br>
component (ii) for obtaining the polymer composition,<br>
and<br>
(c) recovering the obtained composition.<br>
A preferred multistage process is a "loop-gas phase"-process, such as developed by Borealis<br>
A/S, Denmark (known as BORSTAR® technology) described e.g. in patent literature, such as<br>
in EP 0887 379, in WO92/12182 or in WO 2005/002744.<br>
The polymer compositions produced according to the invention can be used for a great<br>
variety of applications, like for example for blown films, pipe, extrusion coating, wire and<br>
cable jacketing, injection moulding, blow moulding or rotomoulding<br>
Methods:<br>
Molecular weights, molecular weight distribution (Mn, Mw, MWD) - GPC<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight distribution (MWD =<br>
Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight and Mw is the weight average<br>
molecular weight) was measured by a method based on ISO 16014-1:2003 and ISO 16014-<br>
4:2003. A Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument, equipped with refractive index detector<br>
and online viscosimeter was used with 3 x TSK-gel columns (GMHXL-HT) from TosoHaas<br>
and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized with 200 mg/L 2,6-Di tert butyl-4-methyl-phenol)<br>
as solvent at 145 °C and at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. 216.5 uL of sample solution<br>
were injected per analysis. The column set was calibrated using relative calibration with 19<br>
narrow MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the range of 0.5 kg/mol to 11 500 kg/mol and a<br>
set of well characterized broad polypropylene standards. All samples were prepared by<br>
dissolving 5 - 10 mg of polymer in 10 mL (at 160 °C) of stabilized TCB (same as mobile<br>
phase) and keeping for 3 hours with continuous shaking prior sampling in into the GPC<br>
instrument.<br>
The bulk density of the polymer powder was determined according to ASTM D 1895-96,<br>
method A.<br>
Comonomer content was determined in a known manner based on Fourier transform<br>
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) determination using Nicolet Magna 550 IR spectrometer<br>
together with Nicolet Omnic FTIR software calibrated with 13C-NMR<br>
Al, K and Zr determination (ICP-method)<br>
The elementary analysis of a catalyst was performed by taking a solid sample of mass, M,<br>
cooling over dry ice. Samples were diluted up to a known volume, V, by dissolving in nitric<br>
acid (HNO3, 65 %, 5 % of V) and freshly deionised (Dl) water (5 % of V). The solution was<br>
then added to hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40 %, 3 % of V), diluted with Dl water up to the final<br>
volume, V, and left to stabilise for two hours. The analysis was run at room temperature<br>
using a Thermo Elemental IRIS Advantage XUV Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic<br>
Excitation Spectrometer (ICP-AES) which was calibrated immediately before analysis using a<br>
C = —-— Equation 1<br>
M<br>
Where: C is the concentration in ppm, related to % content by a factor of 10,000<br>
R is the reported value from the ICP-AES<br>
V is the total volume of dilution in ml<br>
M is the original mass of sample in g<br>
If dilution was required then this also needs to be taken into account by multiplication of C by<br>
the dilution factor.<br>
The catalyst productivity is defined as the amount of polymer in kilograms obtained per<br>
gram solid catalytic component used (e.g. kg PE/ g catalyst), (polymerisation conditions: 60<br>
min at 80°C)<br>
Example 1<br>
Complex preparation<br>
10 ml of 30 wt% methylalumoxane in toluene (MAO, 13.78wt% Al, supplied by Albemarie)<br>
were admixed with 26 mg of KCI and stirred at room temperature for 18 hours to form a<br>
solution.<br>
A 5 ml aliquot of the above solution was subsequently contacted with 33 mg of [(1,2,4-<br>
Me3Cp)2ZrCI2] (supplied by Boulder Scientific Company) to yield the activated complex<br>
solution with a molar ratio of Al/K = 150 and Al/Zr= 300.<br>
Emulsion formation<br>
50 ml of dried perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (PFC) (94%, F2 Chemicals Ltd) were<br>
placed in a 100 ml emulsion reactor. The contents was subsequently bubbled with nitrogen<br>
for 15 minutes, and cooled to 0°C for 20 min. An emulsion was then generated by adding the<br>
above mentioned activated complex solution and a 3-perfluorooctyl-1,2-propeneoxide<br>
(PFPO, 96%, Sigma-Aldrich) surfactant-solution (0.2 ml of a stock solution made from 1 ml<br>
surfactant (PFPO and 4 ml of PFC) and stirring with 554 rpm for 15 min.<br>
Solidification<br>
Approximately 75% of the above emulsion was siphoned into a separate vessel containing<br>
150 ml of stirred (435 rpm) and heated PFC (98°C) using a Teflon tube. The temperature of<br>
the contents decreased between 76°C to 80°C while adding the emulsion. A precipitate<br>
formed immediately.<br>
Isolation<br>
The mixture was allowed to cool to 32°C under stirring for 35 min. PFC was siphoned out<br>
and the remaining yellow catalyst was dried in argon flow at 50°C for two hours.<br>
Comparative Example CE1 and CE2<br>
As comparative example CE1 a catalyst was prepared according to Example 1, but adding<br>
KCI in such an amount (390 mg) that a molar ratio of AI:K of 30:1 was obtained.<br>
As comparative Example CE2 a catalyst was prepared according to Example 1, but without<br>
addition of KCI.<br>
ICP elemental analysis of the catalyst samples can be seen in Table 1<br>
Example 2: Ethylene-co-1-hexene Polymerisation Procedure<br>
Polymerisations were carried out in a Buchi 5 L stainless steel autoclave reactor equipped<br>
with a paddle stirrer and a continuous supply of ethylene. Ethylene (&gt;99.95%), nitrogen<br>
(&gt;99.999%) and isobutane (&gt;97%), 1-hexene (&gt;99%) were further treated with sets of<br>
purifiers removing selectively O2, H2O, CO, CO2 and acetylene.<br>
An appropriate amount of the catalysts prepared according to Example 1, CE1 and CE2 was<br>
charged to a feeding vessel in glove box after which the feeding vessel is transferred to the<br>
reactor. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen and charged with propane (1.1 kg), ethylene<br>
(150 g) and 1-hexene (55 ml) at room temperature. The reactor temperature was then raised<br>
to 60 C at which point the catalyst was injected under N2 over pressure. The reactor<br>
temperature was immediately reset to 80 °C (time from 60-80 C ca. 5-8 min) and ethylene<br>
was fed on demand to maintain 38 bar total pressure in the reactor. The polymerisation<br>
experiment was terminated 60 min after the 80 °C set point was reached, via rapid venting<br>
the reactor contents. The polymer sample was then collected and allowed to dry in a well<br>
vented fume-hood overnight.<br>
Further parameters of the polymerisation process and of the polyethylene copolymer<br>
samples can be seen from Table 2:<br>
Table 2:<br>
n.m. not measured<br>
The catalyst according to the invention (Example 1) yields a polyethylene copolymer with<br>
clearly narrower MWD than the catalyst prepared without addition of KCI (CE2) as can be<br>
seen from Table 2. This narrowing in MWD is a clear indication of the single-site nature of<br>
the inventive catalyst.<br>
In Figure 1 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the catalysts according to<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Examples CE1 and CE2 are shown. These images clearly<br>
illustrate the tremendous improvement in catalyst morphology for the catalyst according to<br>
the invention (Example 1)<br>
