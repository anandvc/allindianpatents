				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process of preparing pyrotechnic favoured castable coloured smoke which is suitable for generating coloured smoke using coloured dyes which sublime into vapour directly from solid state.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
When a Smoke Composition utilizes the heat of chemical reaction between oxidizer and fuel, to vaporize the volatile ingredients present in the composition, it is known as Pyrotechnic Smoke Composition. In a Colour Smoke Composition the colour dye ingredients vaporize and subsequently the dye vapour condenses in atmosphere, giving Coloured Smoke. Some of the Pyrotechnic Colour Smoke Composition known in the art are made with binder or without binder. When a binder is used as a constituent of smoke composition, it is known as a Castable Smoke Composition. Pyrotechnic Favoured Castable Colour Smoke Composition have been used for signaling, marking, tracking, spotting and distress signaling.<br>
One of the Pyrotechnic Castable Colour Smoke Composition known in the art comprises by weight of 10 to 25% of alkali metal chlorate as oxidant, selected from the group consisting of Potassium Chlorate and Sodium chlorate, 10 to 30% of Guanidine Nitrate, 10 to 35% of synthetic-aliphatic epoxy resin, 1 to 15% of organic plasticizer, 0 to 3% of hardener, 25 to 50% of a sublimable organic dye, 0 to 5% of atleast one metal oxide and the carbazate.<br>
One of the disadvantages of the above is, that this composition has to be processed at elevated temperature of 60° C and above.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above composition is that, the binder is also to be prepared separately at elevated temperature of 60° C and above.<br>
Another Pyrotechnic Colour Smoke Composition known in the art. contains 1.4-benzenedicarboxylic acid between about 7 and 35% by weight, solvent red dye between about 30 and 50% by weight, fuel between about 13 and 25% by weight, potassium chlorate between about 17 and 30% by weight, sodium bicarbonate or magnesium bicarbonate between about 5 and 20% by weight,<br>
One of the disadvantages of the above composition is use of acetone in the preparation or the composition by the wet mixing method, as acetone is a fire hazard. This may result into injurv to workers and accidental fire during the course of its manufacture.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above composition is the use of special process equipment's required for its production/pelletisation<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above composition is that the density of the peilet  being<br>
lower, production of smoke vis-a-vis per unit volume of the pellet is less.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above composition is the that it poses dust hazard during processing due to the absence of binder.<br>
