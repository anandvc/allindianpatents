				<td>LID FOR A BEVERAGE CONTAINER TO HOLD A DECOCTION BEVERAGE<br>
The invention concerns a lid for a beverage container for holding a<br>
decoction beverage, preferably for a disposable teacup.<br>
It is known that hot beverages, e.g., can be sold to be taken out at kiosks<br>
or other sales outlets set up for this purpose. In such cases the hot beverage is<br>
typically sold in a disposable drinking container, e.g., of cardboard or<br>
Styrofoam. These disposable cups or containers in such cases are usually<br>
closed with a lid which, on the one hand, is supposed to keep the hot liquid<br>
from spilling, and on the other, to keep it hot.<br>
Such cup-lid combinations are known, e.g., for coffee where the lid for<br>
such a coffee container is usually a simple plastic lid with a clamping edge<br>
around its circumference. In this case either a single opening or a raised<br>
drinking spout with an opening is provided near the edge of the lid through<br>
which the hot coffee can be drunk from the container without removing the lid<br>
The goal of the invention is now to make it possible to sell tea in a<br>
manner comparable to the above mentioned "street sale" of hot coffee to be<br>
consumed off the premises. At the same time the tea must satisfy certain<br>
quality requirements, especially it must be possible to have tea brewed with<br>
fresh tea leaves.<br>
The problem of the invention is therefore to devise a lid for a beverage<br>
container to hold a decoction beverage with which tea or another decoction<br>
1<br><br>
beverage can be prepared and can be securely closed in a beverage container<br>
and sold to a customer on the street.<br>
This problem is solved by the lid according to claim 1.<br>
Advantageous modifications of the lid are reported in the dependent<br>
claims 2-9. Claim 10 finally describes a unit consisting essentially of such a lid<br>
and a decoction unit arranged in the lid.<br>
According to the invention, the lid has a base plate as well as a cover<br>
arranged at a distance from the base plate. Between the base plate and the<br>
cover a holding space is formed which is bounded by side walls surrounding it<br>
on the sides. In the base plate a first opening is provided. The latter is of such<br>
dimensions that a decoction unit containing decoction material can be guided<br>
through it. In the cover or in the region of the same a second opening is<br>
formed smaller than the first opening formed in the base plate. This opening is<br>
of such size that at least one section of the decoction unit can be guided<br>
through it. Finally the holding space is dimensioned to hold at least part of the<br>
decoction unit.<br>
With the lid according to the invention a decoction unit, preferably a<br>
decoction pouch containing tea leaves, can be suspended through the opening<br>
formed in the base plate in the interior space of the beverage container,<br>
especially a disposable tea container. In this case is envisioned that a section<br>
of the decoction unit, especially a handle is affixed which passes through the<br>
second opening formed in the cover and is affixed to the lid in a suitable way.<br>
2<br><br>
The decoction unit passes through the opening formed in the base plate of the<br>
lid advantageously to such a length that it extends into the beverage container<br>
far enough that it comes in contact with the hot water or other brewing liquid<br>
contained in it. After the end of the brewing time the decoction unit can be<br>
grasped on the section extending through the opening formed in the covering<br>
and pulled out through said opening. At this time the part of the decoction unit<br>
extending through the opening formed in the base plate is at least partially<br>
pulled into the holding space formed between the base plate and the cover. In<br>
particular, at this time the decoction unit is pulled far enough out of the<br>
beverage container that it is no longer in contact with the decoction liquid,<br>
especially the hot water or the decoction beverage formed in the meanwhile<br>
In this way the lid according to the invention fulfills at least two functions.<br>
On the one hand it covers the beverage container with the decoction beverage<br>
contained in it reliably so that an inadvertent spilling as well as premature<br>
cooling is avoided in the case when a hot decoction beverage is involved. On<br>
the other hand, the lid according to the invention serves for simple manipulation<br>
of a decoction unit which can extend through said lid for the preparation of a<br>
decoction beverage in a decoction or brewing liquid and then without lifting the<br>
lid can also be removed from it in a simple way.<br>
In particular it is possible with the lid according to the invention to<br>
prepare tea in the form of tea leaves in a decoction pouch for preparation of a<br>
high-quality tea in a disposable tea container, e.g., for "street sale".<br>
3<br><br>
The lid is preferably fabricated from a plastic, especially by deep<br>
drawing. Alternatively the lid, however, may also be formed from a paper or<br>
cardboard material by a suitable shaping process. The lid is preferably formed<br>
of two elements, one part representing the cover, the remaining part being<br>
fabricated as one piece.<br>
According to an advantageous variant of the invention described in claim<br>
2 the second opening is formed as a slit. In this way the opening formed in or<br>
in the region of the cover is of a particularly small dimensions so that both the<br>
risk of spilling of the contents of the beverage container through said opening<br>
as well as the possibility of premature cooling of a hot beverage contained in it<br>
is reduced. Especially preferably the slit shaped opening can be further<br>
covered by a tongue-like or tab-like part of the cover and be essentially closed<br>
in a resting position.<br>
Another advantageous modification of the invention (claim 3) envisions<br>
that the lid has a preferably encircling clamping edge for clamping onto the<br>
beverage container. With such a clamping edge the lid can be safely and<br>
reliably affixed to the beverage container without the risk that the lid may<br>
become inadvertently detached from the beverage container or fall off.<br>
In another variant of the invention (claim 4) it is envisioned that the<br>
covering is arranged sloping at an acute angle to the base plate. By this type of<br>
arrangement a holding space with a wedge-shaped cross-section is created.<br>
Such a wedge-shaped holding space is advantageous, on one hand, for<br>
4<br><br>
holding the decoction unit, and also satisfies the purpose of guiding the<br>
decoction unit when it is pulled in as will be explained in more detail later with<br>
reference to the description of the example of embodiment.<br>
According to another advantageous feature of the invention (claim 5) the<br>
lid displays guiding surfaces sloping with respect to the base plate for guiding a<br>
section of the handle of the decoction unit. Such sloping guiding surfaces<br>
provide support during the wedging of the decoction unit in the holding space<br>
after it has been pulled through the opening in the bottom plate. As a result the<br>
decoction unit, on one hand, is "wrung out" by squeezing and on the other, it is<br>
held in the holding space.<br>
The acute angle enclosed between the base plate and the guiding<br>
surfaces is advantageously larger than the acute angle between the bottom<br>
surface and the cover (claim 6).<br>
If the lid is also constructed according to the advantageous variant<br>
shown in claim 7 the latter can be pulled along a plane running obliquely<br>
through the holding space through the first opening and second opening<br>
respectively. In this way the possibility arises of pulling a larger section of the<br>
decoction unit into the interior of the holding space than if the two openings in<br>
the base plate and the covering were arranged aligned with each other. The<br>
rest arranged in the region of the base plate lyfng opposite the second opening<br>
for a part of the handle of the decoction unit creates the possibility of affixing<br>
the decoction unit to the lid in a position in which it extends as far as it can<br>
5<br><br>
through the opening in the base plate so that it cannot pass completely through<br>
the opening in the base plate.<br>
Advantageously the lid has a drinking opening in a region of the edge<br>
which forms a connection to the inner space of the beverage container when<br>
the lid is seated on the beverage container. Such a drinking opening permits<br>
the contents of the beverage container to be consumed without having to<br>
remove the lid from the beverage container.<br>
The drinking opening is preferably arranged diametrically opposite the<br>
second opening arranged in an edge region of the lid (claim 9). In this way<br>
during drinking through the drinking opening any influence by the section of the<br>
decoction unit protruding out of the second opening is avoided.<br>
Finally in claim 10 a unit composed of a lid according to the invention<br>
and a decoction unit is claimed. Such a unit may be kept on hand already<br>
assembled in order to simplify the preparation of a decoction beverage. A<br>
decoction beverage can be prepared by introducing a decoction liquid,<br>
especially hot water for tea, into a beverage container, e.g., a disposable tea<br>
container and subsequently putting on the lid, already assembled with the<br>
decoction unit, e.g., the tea pouch. The beverage can be handed over to the<br>
consumer directly in this constellation. The latter after a certain time<br>
determined by himself can remove the decoction unit by pulling the section<br>
extending out of the second opening out of the decoction liquid and enjoy the<br>
freshly prepared decoction beverage.<br>
6<br><br>
Other advantages and features of invention may be derived from the<br>
following description of examples of embodiment with reference to the<br>
appended figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a three-dimensional view of a lid according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows the lid in figure 1 from above;<br>
Figure 3 is a cross-section through the lid shown in Figures 1 and 2<br>
Figure 4 shows the lid according to the invention without the cover, in a<br>
three-dimensional view;<br>
Figure 5 lid without cover, top view;<br>
Figure 6 is a sectional representation along line A-A in Figure 5, and<br>
Figure 7 (a) through 7 (c) schematically illustrate the use of the lid<br>
according to the invention together with a decoction unit in three different<br>
sectional representations.<br>
The figures show an example of embodiment of a lid according to the<br>
invention. The same elements are provided with the same reference numbers.<br>
To describe the lid according to the invention first reference is made to<br>
Figures 1 through 6 taken as a whole. The lid according to the invention is<br>
generally denoted in the figures by 1. This lid 1 has a bottom plate 2 and a<br>
cover 3. Between the bottom plate 2 and the cover 3 bounded on the side by a<br>
surrounding side wall 4 a holding space 5 is formed. The cover 3 is arranged<br>
sloping at an acute angle with respect to the bottom plate 2.<br>
7<br><br>
In the bottom plate 2 a first opening 6 is formed. This opening 6 is<br>
essentially rectangular with rounded off corner regions. In a first direction<br>
viewed along the shorter length of the essentially rectangular opening 6 the<br>
opening 6 lies in the center of the bottom plate 2. In the direction of its longer<br>
dimension the opening 6 extends essentially over the entire width of the bottom<br>
plate 2.<br>
In the region of the cover 3, more precisely, between the bottom side of<br>
the cover 3 and the side wall 4 a second opening 1 is located. This opening 7<br>
is essentially formed as a slit and is covered by a flap-shaped extension of the<br>
cover (flap 13).<br>
The lid 1 has a surrounding clamping edge 8 with which it can be affixed<br>
on a beverage container, preferably a disposable tea container. In a region<br>
outside of the side wall 4, therefore, starting at the side wall 4 running in the<br>
direction of the clamping edge 8 a drinking opening 11 is arranged in the upper<br>
edge of the lid 1. The bottom plate 2 in one section has a rest 10 whose<br>
function will be explained later.<br>
The cover 3 is placed on a resting edge 12 formed as a ledge in the side<br>
wall 4.<br>
The lid 1 is constructed entirely of two parts, the cover 3 being a<br>
separate component. The rest of the lid is fabricated in one piece by deep<br>
drawing of plastic. For final assembly of the lid 1 the cover 3 is placed on the<br>
8<br><br>
resting edge 12 and there affixed in a suitable way, e.g., by gluing, welding or<br>
the like.<br>
The figures 7 (a) through 7 (c) show how the lid 1 according to the<br>
invention is used in connection with a decoction unit 20. Figure 7(a) shows how<br>
a decoction unit 20 is inserted in the lid 1. The decoction unit 20 has a pouch<br>
part 21 in which decoction material such as tea leaves is held The pouch part<br>
21	is arranged on a handle 22. The handle 22 is plate shaped and preferably<br>
formed from paper or cardboard material. The pouch part 21 is formed on<br>
handle 22 in such a way that sections of the handle 22 extend on both sides of<br>
the connection site between the pouch part 21 and handle 22 , i.e. the grasping<br>
section 23 and a supporting section 24.<br>
To insert the decoction unit 20 the latter is inserted with the gripping<br>
section 23 in front from the bottom through the opening 6 into the lid 1 until the<br>
gripping section 23 passes through the opening 7. At this time the handle 22 is<br>
guided during the insertion on the guiding surface 5 so that the gripping section<br>
23 can be securely passed through the opening 7. In this first step, as shown<br>
in Figure 7 (a) the flap 13 is bent around. The direction of motion is indicated in<br>
Figure 7 (a) by an arrow. When the entire supporting segment 24 of the handle<br>
22	is located on the far side of the edge of opening 6 lying opposite opening 7<br>
the handle 22 is swiveled and pushed so far back into the holding space 5 that<br>
the supporting section 24 lies with its edge on the outermost end of the rest 10.<br>
This is shown in Fig. 7(b), the direction of movement being indicated by the<br>
9<br><br>
arrow. In this position the decoction unit 20 is securely fixed to the lid 1 and the<br>
pouch part 21 extends by the maximal length out of opening 6 of the bottom<br>
plate 2 of the lid 1. The pouch part 21 of the decoction unit 20 can therefore,<br>
e.g., extend jointly into hot water located in a disposable drinking container on<br>
which the lid 1 with a decoction unit 20 inserted is seated and serve to prepare<br>
the decoction beverage<br>
If the decoction beverage is already prepared, the handle 22 on the<br>
gripping section 23 is grasped and pulled out in the direction of the arrow<br>
shown in Fig. 7 (c) from the opening 7. At that time the pouch part 21 of the<br>
decoction unit 20 is pulled into the holding space 5. The pouch part 21 is then<br>
at least partially enclosed in the holding space 5. In this step the pouch part 21<br>
is also squeezed and "wrung out" so that decoction beverage still held in the<br>
pouch part 21, e.g., in the case of a disposable drinking container, runs back.<br>
In particular, the pouch part 21 after the gripping section 23 is pulled our or the<br>
pouch part 21 pulled into the holding space 5, is no longer in contact with the<br>
decoction beverage so that, for example, in the case of tea one cannot draw<br>
too long and too much bitter substances out of the tea into the hot water or<br>
decoction.<br>
The decoction unit 21 then remains in the last-mentioned position. The<br>
decoction beverage held in the beverage container can be drunk through the<br>
opening 11 without having the decoction beverage come into further contact<br>
with the pouch part 21 of the decoction unit 20. This means the lid need not be<br>
10<br><br>
taken off in order to remove the pouch part 21 from the decoction beverage but<br>
can remain on the beverage container and prevent spilling or premature cooling<br>
of the beverage.<br>
With the lid 1 according to the invention it is possible to prepare<br>
decoction beverages of high-quality, especially high-quality teas and especially<br>
to offer them in disposable drinking containers for sale on the street.<br>
