(c)	INDIAN FIRM<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the ASPHALT &amp; WET MIX PAVER<br>
FINISHER. The asphalt &amp; wet mix paver finisher machine is related to the spreading or filling of paving material in a desired and ready for laying of mix materials at the road laying. This invention is related to road construction apparatus. Accordingly the general objects of the present invention are to provide novel and improved methods and apparatus of such character.<br>
Road construction method and apparatus are well known. The equipment employed in highway construction, which may be generally described as paving machines. The conventional paving machines have a chassis, which has a skip at its front end. The skip to which the material to be applied over the roadbed is supplied, is conventionally provided with pivotal sidewall sections which define a filling funnel therefore. Such a paving machine also consists of the chassis for working the applied materials, a device known in the trade as a "beam". The skip will have a discharge opening at the bottom and a conveyor moves material, which is dumped into the skip and subsequently flows out the length of the beam by a "distributing worm". The beam of prior art paving machines is typically comprised of a primary beam and a pair of oppositely disposed, adjustable beam extensions so that the material being deposited on the roadbed can be spread across the appropriate area. The distance of the opposed beam extensions project from the main beam is usually separated control via hydraulic actuators to selective control the lane width.<br>
2<br><br>
During road construction or repair, trenches are often excavated alongside -the outermost travel lanes. During finishing of the road, it may be necessary to close such trenches and to form a shoulder area of breakdown lane. The conventional Paving Finisher Machine is consisted with chain and sprockets of rear wheel but during the paving operation some paving materials were comes in contact with this chain and sometime this paving material was entrapped between the space portions of the chain, which damage the chain. This paving finisher machine has number of clutch i.e. main clutch plates, fiber facing clutch plates, conveyor clutch plates so; the operator was confuses to operate the paving machine. In this paving finisher machine has single front wheel with mechanical steering so it provides less base portion to support to the whole device and it has more then two hand operated laver for gear shifting &amp; engaging to change the speed of the paving machine. Road leveling problem was screed so; it requires more time for road laying so, it becomes very costly process. There are many joints in chassis wall of conventional paving machine so; the breakdown is occurred in this machine alternately which increase maintains cost and alternate breakdown is also time consuming. Also the conventional paving machine has low hopper capacity to store paving material so, it require to continues load the paving material in hopper. These limitations are overcome by the present invention of the ASPHALT &amp; WET MIX PAVER FINISHER is invented with unique design.<br>
3<br><br>
The present invention is described with great specific and clarity with reference to following drawings:<br>
Fig.l	represent the elevation view of the asphalt and wet mix paver<br>
finisher machine.<br>
Fig.2	represents the top view of the asphalt and wet mix paver<br>
finisher machine.<br>
Fig.3	represents the front view of the asphalt and wet mix paver<br>
finisher machine.<br>
ASPHALT &amp; WET MIX PAVER FINISHER is consists with chassis wall (1), engine (2), automotive gear box (3), low- high gear box (4), conveyor gear box (5), conveyor chain (6), conveyor drive sprocket special design (7), left and right conveyor drive hydraulic (8), hopper (9), front wheel hydraulic jack (10), rear wheel (11), screed mechanical extension (12), screed hydraulic jack (13), hopper hydraulic jack telescopic (14), steering hydraulic jack (15), level screw (16), extension screw (17), worm (18), vibrating tempting arrangement hydraulic drive(19), hydraulic steering wheel (20), desk board (21) and fuel and hydraulic oil tank (22).Asphalt &amp; wet mix paver finisher machine has two gear box system(4) to maintain high and low speed. High speed is use for the transporting machine to the site and low speed is use for the paving operation. When paving machine is starts paving mix material delivered in the conventional manner by a succession of dump trucks by means of raising and tilting the truck into the hopper (9) from the dumper then the conveyor chain with oil bath system (6) is rotate<br>
4<br><br>
and mix materials then its go to the back side of paver machine up to the augur systems for spreading and laying by the screed. Where the worm (18) is mounted for spreading the paving material and screed mechanical extension (12) is also internally available so; there is not required to connect any externally extension. Here the conveyor chain has 8 teeth X 80 sprockets wheel so, paving material is not entrapped into the conveyor chain and the conveyor chain has divide into two parts i.e. left and right so, the conveyor chain as per requirement of the road width. If we requires to make single road then center type conveyor chain system is selected and if we requires to make double road then the right side conveyor system is selected then after left side conveyor system is to be selected. Front wheel (10) has two-jack system. One of jack is hopper hydraulic jack telescopic (14) is for to lifting the hopper from both side and the steering hydraulic jack (15) is connected with two front wheel (10) for hydraulic drive which is control through the hydraulic steering wheel (20). Front wheel drive assembly connected with chassis on front side with tilting "T" type hubs and hydraulic jacks for power steering and tie road system for front wheel drive and it is connected with hydraulic power steering at desk board for paver operator. The desk board is mounted on chassis (1) on the left side with all hydraulic operating apparatuses i.e. lever control valve, lighting system, engine start &amp; stop system and engine temperature and other indicator. Vibrating tempting arrangements for hydraulic drive (19) and up &amp; down road leveling system with screw/ unscrew system with hand wheels (16) are connected with screed. Main conveyor chain with shaft and sprockets and roller conveyor shaft is connected with bottom of chassis (1). Engine (2) mounting on chassis (1) with automotive clutch and single lever operated automotive<br>
5<br><br>
gearbox with oil bath system. Fuel and hydraulic oil tank (22) is mounted below the hydraulic steering wheel (20). Low and high gear box with oil bath system is mounted on chassis and connected with automotive gearbox system through a chain drive system. Second side of chain drive system is connected with main drive of rear wheel (11) through shaft. Rear wheel chain drive is covered with metal cover to restrict the paving material to entrap between the chain spaces.<br>
