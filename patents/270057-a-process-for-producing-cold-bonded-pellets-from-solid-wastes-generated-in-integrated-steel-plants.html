The specific amount of such wastes generated depend on various factors such as the quality of raw materials, level of technology applied in practice, operating philosophy including dealing with and considerations for the environmental pollution and waste disposal/handling etc. The average specific rate of waste generation in an integrated steel plant is in the order of 800 kg per ton of crude steel produced and include slag from iron/steel making process, slimes, BOF and COREX sludges, BF flue dust and BOF dust, scales formed in continuous caster and the hot strip mill etc. These wastes are rich in mineral contents and pose environmental concern relating to handling and disposal thereof. Stringent regulations relating to restriction on emission of industrial pollutants and the increasing costs of primary sources of materials have made it imperative to maximize recycling of by-products and wastes generated in an integrated steel plant.<br>
2<br><br>
Several techniques have been applied to recycle the steel plant waste, of which cold bond agglomeration using briquetting process is the most commonly adopted method. In this process, the steel plant wastes such as the slag, sludge, scales etc. are mixed thoroughly with a binder and are sent to briquetting press. In the briquetting process requisite amount of load is applied to compact the mass and provide adequate strength to the agglomerated mass. However, such conventional briquetting process had the inherent disadvantage with respect to the non-uniform size of the agglomerated mass and non-homogeneity in composition making it difficult for recycling in various unit processes like blast furnace, Corex, hot metal pre-treatment, cupola, LD converter etc.<br>
There has been thus a continuing need to develop an alternative to briquetting process of agglomeration such as to provide agglomerated masses of favorable size capable for diverse requirement for recycling in different unit processes in the integrated steel plants and effectively control the handling and disposal of solid wastes.<br>

The pelletization process according to the process of the present invention was carried out as follows:<br>
1.	Firstly, the revert materials used for recycling containing slimes from ore beneficiation plant, BF dust, Sludge from COREX and BOF, mill scales from the hot strip mills and the continuous caster, obtained in less than 100 mesh size were mixed thoroughly, the constituents being selectively mixed; After thorough mixing of the basic ingredients, water was next added to the mix to maintain the moisture between 8-15% by weight of the total mix;<br>
2.	In the following step, the wet mix was then sent to standard balling/pelletizing disc, to make green balls/pellets. At this stage further 1-3% moisture was added as per the requirements to prepare balls/pellets of desired size. The green balls/pellets were obtained in the size range of 5-25mm having total moisture content of 9-18%;<br>
3.	The green balls/pellets were then initially dried for duration ranging from 4 to 24 hours, based on the requirement of initial strength of pellets.<br>
4.	The dried green balls /pellets were cured by spraying water so that the same remained always wet or by completely dipping the same in water for a period varying from 3 to 10 days.<br>
5.	The cured balls/pellets which contained moisture up to 25% were next dried in air to remove the moisture which continued for about 0 to 10 days so as to retain moisture content at a level less than 10% by wt.<br>
6.	The dried balls/pellets were sent for chemical analysis and tested for cold tumbler test, cold crushing strength, high temperature properties, such as Reduction Degradation Index (RDI-6.3mm,%) and (RDI-0.5mm,%), metallization, degree of reduction and crushing strength of reduced material.<br>
The properties of cold bonded pellets obtained from a typical blend comprising 10-15% Slag Cement, 30-60% BOF Sludge and 30-60% Slimes is shown in following Table II and III.<br>

The green balls/pellets obtained using pelletising disc from waste materials are preferably in the size range of 5-25mm diameter and of desirable properties suitable for recycling through blast furnace, COREX, hot metal pre-treatment, Cupola, LD converter etc. The method of recycling is directed to reducing the cost of steel produced by reusing mineral values recovered from the waste material/by-products, control industrial pollutants/environmental hazards and thus providing scope for its wide scale industrial application in integrated steel plants.<br>
