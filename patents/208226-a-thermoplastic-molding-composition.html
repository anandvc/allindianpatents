THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A THERMOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITION"<br>
BAYER   AKTIENGESETLSCHAFT,   a   German   company,    of   D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic molding composition. Thermoplastic moulding compositions<br>
ABS moulding compositions have already been employed in large amounts for many years as thermoplastic resins for the production of all types of mouldings, The spectrum of properties of these resins here ranges from relatively brittle, to very tough.<br>
A specific field of use of ABS moulding compositions is the production of mouldings by injection moulding (e.g. housings., toys  motor vehicle components), .- where very good flowability of the polymer material is particularly important.   In addition, the mouldings produced in this way must as a rule have a good notched impact strength.<br>
There is'the object of achieving the highest possible toughness values at a given rubber content, given rubber particle size and given matrix resin molecular weight, while retaining the good thermoplastic flowability. The high toughness .values should be obtained here as far as possible independently of the type of matrix resin employed, especially when the styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers and α-memylstyrene/acrylonitrilecopolymers typical of ABS are used.'<br>
One possibility of increasing the toughness of ABS polymers at a given rubber content, given rubber particle size and given matrix molecular weight is the addition of special silicone oil compounds (cf. EP-A 6521); however, disadvantages such as poor paintability, inadequate printability or impaired yield stress values (risk of white fracture) may occur here. The addition of small amounts of EPDM rubber (cf. EP-A 412 370) or AES polymer (cf. EP-A 412 371) has also been described. However, both methods require relatively expensive additive components employed in considerable amounts.<br>
It has now been found that by employing special additive mixtures, ABS products with a very good combination of notched impact strength (both at room temperature and at a low temperature) and thermoplastic processability are obtained.<br><br>
The invention relates to thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising<br>
A)	5 to 95 wt.%, preferably 10 to 90 wt.%, and particularly preferably 20 to 75 wt.% of one or more thermoplastic homo-, co- or terpolymers of styrene, a-methylstyrene, styrene substituted on the nucleus, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, maleic anhydride, N-substituted maleimide or mixtures thereof<br>
