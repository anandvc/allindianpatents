COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
Title of the invention<br>
FABRIC CARE COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a method of treating fabric with fabric care compositions and to the use of such fabric care compositions.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
The-sensory feel of a fabric following conventional laundering processes is an important property. In particular, the "softness" of a fabric is a highly desirable quality in the laundered fabric. The term "softness" generally refers, for example, to the feeling of smoothness to the touch and flexibility of the fabric. In addition, the term "softness" refers to the general feeling of comfort registered by the human skin on contact with the fabric.<br>
However, although fabric softness is a desired sensory attribute it is also desirable that fabrics feel crisp and new.  A good example of this that a shirt should feel soft to the skin and yet still feel crisp when worn rather than feel limp.<br>
When conventional softening systems have been used such as cationic softening systems the crisp feel of the fabric has been sacrificed for the soft feel.<br>
2<br><br>
Starch is a conventional material used to stiffen fabrics and impart body to them. However, starch makes the fabric feel harsh.<br>
It remains desirable to have improved systems for treating fabric that provide fabric softness and yet allow-the fabric to feel crisp and have body.<br>
The"-present" -invention 'aims to • provide ";a-method of "treating fabrics that renders their feel soft yet crisp.  The treated fabrics also exhibit body and volume.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a method of treating fabric comprising the step of applying to the fabric:<br>
a coated particle comprising:<br>
(a)  a solid core having a D3,2 average particle size in the<br>
range from 10 to 700 run, and<br>
a coating of silicone polymer covalently bonded to the<br>
solid core.<br>
The   invention  further relates to a fabric  treatment<br>
composition comprising<br>
i)        a coated particle comprising:<br>
a solid core having a D3,2  average particle  size in the range from 10  to 700 nm,   and a coating of silicone polymer covalently bonded to the  solid core  and;<br>
3<br><br>
ii)  any one of the group selected from builder, fabric softening compound, bleaching system or enzyme..<br>
In another aspect of the invention, use of a coated particle comprising a solid core having a D3,2 average particle size in the range from 10 to 700 nrr, and a coating of silicone polymer covalently bonded to the solid core to impart a crisp feel to the fabric.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided use of a coated particle comprising a solid core having a D3,2 average particle size in the range from 10 to 700 ran, and a coating of silicone polymer covalently bonded to the solid core to impart a soft feel to the fabric.<br>
In yet another further aspect of the invention, there is provided use of a coated particle comprising a solid core having a D3,2 average particle size in the range from 10 to 700 nm, and a coating of silicone polymer covalently bonded to the solid core to impart body to the fabric.<br>

Preparation of Coated Particles<br>
The coated particles are preferably prepared as an aqueous pre-emulsion, which can then be mixed with other ingredients to form the shampoo composition.<br>
Different methods of preparation may be used depending of the size of coated particles required.  Suitably, the coated particles can be prepared as follow:<br>
(i)  "Large" coated particles<br>
Larger coated particles, for example having a D3,2 average particle size of at least 100 nm and which employ solid core particles having D3,2 average particle size of at least 50 nm, can be prepared in an aqueous polymerisation system in which the solid core particles are mixed with water, an emulsifying surfactant, an organosiloxane component and a suitable polymerisat ion catalyst.

emulsion of coated particles can be directly incorporated into a shampoo composition.<br>
■ (ii) "Small" coated particles<br>
Smaller coated particles, for example having a D3,2 average particle size of less than 100 nm and which employ solid core particles having D3,2 average particle size of less than 50 ran, tend to have "to be prepared by an alternative organic polymerisation system in which the solid core particles are mixed with an organosiloxane component in an organic solvent, free of any surfactant.  The resulting coated particles are typically precipitated out of .the organic solvent, washed and redispersed in water as an aqueous emulsion with a suitable emulsifying surfactant.<br>
Organosiloxane units<br>
The silicone-coating polymer is suitably prepared by polymerisation of component monomers or oligomers. Typically, the solid core particles are mixed with organosiloxane units having 2-10 silicon atoms and containing no hydroxyl groups and being of unit formula (II):<br>

Examples of anionic emulsifiers are alkylarylsulphonates, e.g., sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, alkyl sulphates e.g., sodium, lauryl sulphate, alkyl ether, sulphates, e.g., sodium lauryl ether sulphate nEO, where n is from 1 to 2 0 alkylphenol ether sulphates, e.g., octylphehol ether sulphate nEO where n is from 1 to 20, and sulphosuccinates, e.g., sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate.<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants are well known to the person skilled in the art.  Preferably, the cationic surfactant contains a quaternary ammonium group.  Suitable examples of such cationic surfactants are described hereinbelow in the section on co-surfactants.  Particularly preferred as cationic emulsifying surfactants are C6-20, preferably C8-18, monoalkyl and dialkyl quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>

Preferably, at least one anionic surfactant or cationic surfactant is present as an emulsifying surfactant.<br>

(i)  Aqueous polymerisation system<br>
In this process, the solid core particles are mixed with water, an emulsifying surfactant, an organosiloxane component and a suitable polymerisation catalyst.  Preferred methods for preparing coated particles according to this system are  .described in ,-JP 1-0114-622 .<br>
Any catalyst may be used so long as it is capable of polymerising a low-molecular organosiloxane in the presence of water.  Suitable catalysts include those commonly used for polymerisation of low-molecular organosiloxanes such as a mixture of hydroxylated aliphatic sulphonic acid with an unsaturated aliphatic sulphonic acid, an aliphatic hydrogen sulphate, an aliphatic substituted benzenesulphonic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid.<br>
Certain anionic surfactant emulsifiers have a weak catalytic action such can be used in conjunction with a polymerisation catalyst.  Such anionic surfactants include sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium octylbenzenesulphonate,<br><br>
ammonium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium lauryl sulphate, ammonium lauryl sulphate, triethanolamine lauryl sulphate, and sodium tetradecenesulphonate and sodium hydroxytetradecenesulphonate.<br>
Cationic surfactant emulsifiers can also have a weak catalytic action and, therefore, it is preferred to use them together with a polymerisation catalyst such as an alkaline<br>
2 1<br><br>
metal hydroxide (e.g., lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide and caesium hydroxide).<br>
The amount of water used in the emulsification is typically from 50 to 500, preferably from 100 to 300 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the coated particles component in the emulsion.  The solid concentration in 'the emulsion is typically –from 20 to 70, preferably from 3 0 to 60 wt% of the total weight of the emulsion.  The temperature of preparation of the emulsion (i.e. for the condensation reaction) is typically in the range from 5 to 100 °C.<br>

The amount of polymerisation catalyst in the emulsification is typically from 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of the total amount of the coated particles component in the emulsion.<br>
As already mentioned, a preferred solid core material of the present invention is colloidal silica.  In the emulsification step, this is present as an aqueous dispersion with Si02 as the basic unit of the solid core particles.  Ordinarily, colloidal silica is classified into acidic and alkaline subclasses based upon its Characteristics and any of them may be appropriately selected and used depending upon the condition for the<br>
22<br><br>
emulsification polymerisation.  When using acidic silica, the emulsifying surfactant should be an anionic surfactant, and conversely, when using an alkaline silica, the emulsifying surfactant should be a cationic surfactant, in order to keep the silica in a stable state.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the emulsifying surfactant is an anionic surfactant. Thus when using silica as the solid 'core, preferably •■acidic silica is used.<br>
(ii) Organic polymerisation system<br>
In this process, the solid core particles are mixed with an organosiloxane component in an organic solvent, free of any surfactant.  The resulting coated particles are typically precipitated out of the organic solvent, washed and redispersed in water with a suitable emulsifying surfactant to form an aqueous emulsion.  Preferred methods for preparing coated particles according to this system are described in Pyun et al. (2001) Polym.   Prepr.    (Am.   Chem. Soc,   Div.   Polym.   Chem.),   Vol. 42(1), 223.<br>
A suitable method for preparing "smaller" coated particles,<br><br>
for example in which the solid core particles have a D3,2 average particle size of 10 to 20 nm. is a microemulsion process.  An example of a suitable microemulsion process for the preparation of silica solid cores coated with silicone polymer is as follows.  Silica colloid is prepared in an aqueous medium (e.g. 6 mM NaOH) by the reaction of methyltrimethoxysilane within micelles in the presence of an emulsifying surfactant (e.g. a quaternary ammonium cationic<br>

Examples of suitable alkali neutralizing agents are sodium hydroxide thorium carbonatr,   thorium bicarbonate and triethanolamine.  Examples of suitable acidic neutralising agents are hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid.<br>
