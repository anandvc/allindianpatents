The present invention relates to novel compounds which are glycine transporter inhibitors and as such effective in the treatment of disorders in the CKS, such as schizoplirenia.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Glutamic acid is the major excitatory amino acid in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), and acts through two classes of receptors, the ionotropic and metabotrobic receptors, respectively. The ionotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three subtypes based on the affinities of agonists for these receptors, namely A^-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), (i?^-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propaiioic acid (AMP A) and kainic acid (or kainate) receptors.<br>
The NMDA receptor contains binding sites for modulatory compounds such as glycine ^d polyamines. Binding of glycine to its receptor enhances the NMDA receptor activation. Such NMDA receptor activation may be beneficial for the treatment of schizoplirenia and other diseases linlced to NMDA receptor dysfunction. An activation can be achieved by an inhibitor of the glycine transporter.<br>
Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of two types of glycine transporters, GlyT-1 and GlyT-2, wherein GlyT-1 can be further subdivided mto GlyT-la, GlyT-lb andGlyT-lc.<br>
The NMDA receptor is blocked by compounds such as phencyclidine which induce a psychotic state which resembles schizophrenia. Likewise, the NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, induce negative and cognitive symptoms similar to schizophrenia. This indicates that NMDA receptor dysflmction is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.<br>
The NMDA receptor has been associated with a number of diseases, such as pain (YdkshPain 1989, 37,111-123), spasticity, myuoclonus and epilepsy (Truong et. al. Movement Disorders 1988, 3, 77-87), learning and memory (Rison et. al. Newosci.<br><br>
Biobehav. Rev. 1995, 19, 533-552), post-traumatic stress disorder (abbreviated: PTSD) (Heresco-ie\y et. al. The InternatianalJournal ofNeuropsychopharmacolog)&gt;, 2002, 5:301-307, entitled; ^Tilot-controlled trial of D-cycloserine for the t'eatment of post-traumatic stress disorder").<br>
Glycine transporter antagonists or inhibitors are believed to be highly beneficial in the treatment of schizophi-enia (Javitt WO 97/20533).<br>
Glycine transport antagonists or inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of both the positive and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychoses, and in the improvement of cognition in conditions where the cognitive processes are dhninished, i.e. Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, AIDS dementia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or diseases wherein the brain is damaged by irmer or outer influence, such as trauma to fhe head or stroke. Likewise, convulsive disorders such as epilepsy, spasticity or myoclonus may benefit from glycine transporter antagonists.<br>
Cluiical trials with glycine have been reported, Javitt et. al. Am. J. Psychiatry 1994, 151, 1234-1236 and Leidennan et. al. Biol. Psychiatry 1996, 39, 213-215, The treatment with high-dose glycine is reported to improve fhe symptoms of schizopiirema. Thare is a need for more efficient compounds foi the treatment of NMDA associated diseases.<br>

Method of preparing the compounds of formula I<br>
The compounds of the invention are prepared by the followmg general methods. Coupling of alcohol of formula n with a phenol of formula IH<br><br><br><br><br>
The cross coupling reaction is typically performed as described by Schopfer (Tetrahedron, 2001, 57. 3069-3073) where an iodide of fonnula VI is coupled to a thiol of formula Vn, R"^-S-H using palladium catalysis in toluene at elevated temperatures.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein R"* is hydrogen may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding esters COOR^'^ wherein R^'* is an insoluble polymer or Cue-alkyl, aryl or aryl-Cu5-allcyl. This may be performed under basic conditions, for example, using aqueous sodium hydroxide in an alcoholic solvent or under acidic conditions in the hydrolysis of a tertiaiy-butyl ester or cleavage from an insoluble polymer.<br>
Compounds of formula H may be prepared as depicted in scheme \.<br><br><br><br>
magnesium (Gilman, Reel. Trav, Chim. Pays-Bas 1935, 58S) or lithium (Hader et al, J.Oj-gaiiomet.Chem. 1989, 364, 1-16) and reacted with bis aryl bissulfides. Alternatively 2-halo-anisoles in the case of the halogen being iodide may be coupled using palladium'phosphine catalysis with a tiiiophenol as described in the general method of Schopfer (Jetrahdron 2001,57 , 3069-3073 to give intermediates, after demethylation of the anisole, of foimula HI.<br>
Intermediates of fomiula IN are typically conunercially a^'ailable or their syntheses are well described in the literature.<br>
Compounds of formula V where X is 0 may be prepared by reacting intermediates of formula III with ethylene carbonate to give the O-hydroxy ethyl derivative which can then be converted to compounds of formula V. Where L is CI this could be using carbon tetrachloride and triphenylphosphine in dichloromethane. In the case of tosylate and mesylate this could by the use of tosyl chloride or metliane sulfonyl chloiide respectively in a solvent such as dichloromefhane or tettahydrofuran. These methods are standard to those skilled in the art. Compounds of formula V where X is carbon may be prepared by the alkylation of suitably substituted 2-iodo-benzylhalides with diethyl malonate in the general procedure described by L.F. Fieser, E. Berliner, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952, 74, 536 to give 2-iodo-pheiiylpropioTiic acids. In tlie cast of X is sulfur, coupling with an appropiate thiophenol using copper catalysis according to the method of Bartl et al, Collection Czechoslovak Chem. Commun, 1981, 46, 141 affords the 2-(arylsulfanyl)phenyl propionic acid which can be reduced using standard methods such as borane-tetrahydrofuran complex or lithium aluminium hydride to 2-(arylsulfanyl)phenyl propanol. Activation of the alcohol to nucleophilic displacement can be performed as described above.<br>
Compounds of formula VI may be prepared by the reaction of intermediates of fomiula n with intermediates of formula XII. The substituents R'-R'° are as defined above, X is oxygen, sulphur or CR' 'R'^, wherein R' ' and R'^ are as defined above, and Z is an iodide. The reaction is typically performed in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydro&amp;ran or diethyl ether containing a coupling agent such as triphenyl<br><br>
pliosphiiie and diethylazodicarboxylate or l,r-(AzodicarbonyI)dipiperidine at room tsmperatm-e.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula XII where Z is an iodide are commercially available or can be easily obtained by demsthylation of the corresponding 2-iodo-aiiisole using for example boron tribromide in toluene or similar methods well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively ti-eatment of tlie corresponding anisole with tert-butyl lithium and quenching with iodine as descrived by Iwao {J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 3622-3627) and subsequent demethylation will also provide intermediates of formula XII. A third approach is the conversion of the appropiate 2-inefhoxy aniline derivative to the iodide in a Sandmeyer reaction as described by Still (J. Org. Chem, 1987, 52, 748-753), followed by demethylation to give intermediates of formula XII. These methods are all well described in the literature.<br>
Examples of formula I may also be prepared by modifications of formula I where R'-R* can be a bromide or iodide and R^" is as defined above but not hydrogen. In this approach the intermediates as described may be reacted with for example with a aryl or heteroary] boronic acid or ester using Suzuki conditions to afford the appropriately substituted aryl or heteroaryl derivative.. Alternatively reaction with an amine using palladium catalysis allows access to examples where the bromide or iodide is replaced with the amine in examples of formula I.<br>

Pharmacological testing<br>
The compounds of the invention were tested in a well-recognised and reliable test measuring glycine uptalce:<br>
[^H]-Glycine uptake<br>
Cells transfected with the human GlyT-lb were seeded in 96 well plates. Prior to the experiment the cells wore washed twice m HBS (10 mM Hepes-tris (pH 7,4), 2,5 mM KCl, 1 noM C&amp;Ch, 2,5 mM MgS04,) and pre-incubated with test compound for 6 minutes. Afterwards, 10 nM ^H-glycine was added to each well and the incubation was continued for 15 minutes. The cells were washed twice in HBS. Scintillation fluid was added and the Plates were counted on a Trilux (Wallac) scintillation counter.<br>
The test results showed, that the prepared compounds of the invention all showed inhibition below 10000 nM as IC50 in the above-mentioned assay.<br><br>
The compounds of the im-ention were also tested in a well-recognised and reliable microdialysis test.<br>
Method<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats, initially weighing 275 - 350 g, were used. The animals were housed under a 12-lir light/dark cycle under controlled conditions for regular in¬door temperature (21±2°C) and humidity (55±5%) with food and tap water available ad libitum.<br>
Rats were anaesthetized with hypnorm/donnicimi (2ml/kg) and intracerebral guide carmulas (CMA'12) were stereotaxically implanted into the brain positioning tiie dialysis probe tip in the ventral hippocampus (co-ordinates 5.6 mm posterior to bregma, lateral -5.0 mm, 7.0 mm ventral to dura). The rats were allowed to recover from surgeiy for at least 2 days. On the day of the experiment, a microdialysis probe (CMA/12, 0.5 mm diameter, 3 mm length) was inserted through the guide cannula. The probes were connected via a dual channel swivel to a microinjection pump. Perfasion of the microdialysis probe with filtered Ringer solution (145 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCli) was begun shortly before insertion of tlie probe into tlie brain and continued for the duration of the experiment at a constant flow of 1 )il/min. After 165 min of stabiUzation, the experiments were initiated. A 20 or 40 min sampling regime was used throughout the experimental period. Time points were corrected for lag time of the perfusate from the microdialysis site to the probe outlet.<br>
After the experiments, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation. The brains were removed, frozen and sectioned (20 |im), and the position of the probes was verified.<br>
Analysis of glycine in the dialysates<br>
The concentration of glycine in the dialysates was analyzed by means of HPLC with fluorescence detection after precolumn online derivatisation with o-phatalaldehyde. The system consisted of a Hypersil AA-ODS column (5 ^m, 2.1 x 200 ram, Agilent) with a Agilent 1100 fluoresence detector (excitation, 266-340 nm; emission, 305-340 nm). Mobile phases consisted of A: 20 mM sodium acetate, 0.018% triethylamine, 0.3<br><br>
% tetrahydrofuran, pH 7.2, B: 20 mM sodium acetate, 40% acetonitriie and 40% methanol pH 7.2. The ovsn temperature was set at 40 °C and flow rate was 0.45 mL/min. Data were collected and analysed using ChemStation software (Agilent) after calibration witli a range of standard glycine solutions (0.1 -10 )iM).<br>
