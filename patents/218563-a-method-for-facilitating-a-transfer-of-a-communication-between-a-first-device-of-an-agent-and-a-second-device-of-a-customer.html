				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A customer is transferred from a first Internet chat session on afirst server to a second Internet chat session on a second serverwithout the customer having to take any action whatsoever. The second server may be the same server as the first server or may be different from the first server and may be physically located in another city, state, country, or continent. When the need arises to transfer a customer chat to another agent (who may be on another server) the agent requests a transfer and a list of available chat sessions is provided (300) to the agent If the agent requests a transfer of the customer to one of those available chat sessions then a determination (310) is made as to whether the proposed transfer is permitted. If the transfer is permitted and initiatd by the agent, the agent&#x27;s computer sends all the transfer information as well as a transfer command to the customers browser. The command sent activates a miniapplication residing on the customer&#x27;s browser that seamlessly connects the customer to a new URL for a second chat session. Further, when the transfer is initiated, all or a portion of the information, including documentation, from the first chat session is simultaneously transferred to the second chat session.</td>

				<td>TRANSFER OF AN INTERNET CHAT SESSION BETWEEN SERVERS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is related to Internet chat sessions and, more particularly, to<br>
the automatic transfer of a person on an Internet chat session from one server to another<br>
server.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
internet chat sessions, although frequently regarded as a simple social<br>
communications device, have a significant business purpose as well. These sessions allow a<br>
person, such as a customer or a potential customer, to conduct, via the Internet, a<br>
communicaticm with a company representative (referred to below as an "agent" for brevity)<br>
so as to obtain information on a product or service, repair or replacement of a product,<br>
technical or other problems or difficulties with a product, etc. The use of the Internet allows<br>
the customer and the agent to communicate one-on-one in real time and even to exchange<br>
electronic media, such as documents, photographs, sound clips, etc., in order to assist the<br>
customer in making an informed decision or aid the customer in resolving a problem. Direct<br>
communications between the agent and the customer have been done in the past by<br>
telephone, but the parties frequently could not exchange documents while communicating<br>
with each, and the company had to bear the expense of telephone lines for that purpose. At<br>
times, many of the telephone lines were not used and so the expense was wasted, and at<br>
other times the number of lines was woefully inadequate for the volume of calls. A<br>
substantial part of this expense is, therefore, avoided when the customer and the company<br>
communicate via an Internet chat session. Farther, Internet chats are more efficient in that<br>
one agent may handle multiple chats simultaneously whereas a telephone conversation<br>
requires all the agent"s attention.<br>
Problems arise when the agent finds that another agent is better suited to answer the<br>
question posed by the customer, or the customer has a question that is best handled by<br>
another company, such as an associated manufacturing company, or a partner, parent, or<br>
sibling company. At present, the agent can only tell the customer of the new URL mat the<br>
customer must go to. In this case, the customer must type in the URL, or cut and paste the<br>
URL, or, at best, the message from the agent will have a hyperlink to the URL so that the<br>
customer can simply double-click on the hyperlink and be connected to the URL.<br>
However, all of these methods require some action or actions on the part of the<br>
customer, and none of these methods conveys any infortmation to the new agent Thus, all of<br>
the past information is lost and the customer must begin again by describing the problem or<br>
the product involved.<br>
Further, mere are times when the server designated to handle the chat sessions may<br>
become overloaded or slow down due to the number of chat sessions or to due to other<br>
procedures winch the server may have to perform. However, there is no provision for<br>
redirecting existing or potentially new chat sessions to another server.<br>
SnmmaryOf The Invention<br>
The present invention provides for downloading a mini-application, such as an<br>
executable code module, to the customer"s computer so that the customer"s computer, such<br>
I as a PC, automatically establishes a new chat session at a new URL specified by the agent<br>
Thus, the customer is required to take no action and is magically transported to another chat<br>
session where the customer can obtain the information or relief desired.<br>
The present invention further provides for transferring the contents of the current<br>
chat session from a first server to a second server, so that the agent at the second server has<br>
the full information and context from the first chat session. Thus, the customer does not<br>
have to begin anew by again describing the problem or the product involved.<br>
The present invention further erprovides for a negotiation between the server handling<br>
the first chat session and the server proposed for handlmg the second chat session so that the<br>
server proposed for handling the second chat session is not handed chat sessions from<br>
parties who are not authorized to do so.<br>
The present invention further provides a first server, which is heavily burdened, the<br>
ability to transfer an existing chat session or an incoming chat session request to a second<br>
server.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Figure 1 is an illustration of a typical environment of the present invention showing<br>
a customer 100 having a computer terminal 110, agents 120A, 120B, 120N having computer<br>
terminals 130A, 130B, 130N, respectively, and company servers 140A, 140B, 140N.<br>
Typically, the computer terminal 110 of a customer will be a personal computer (PC). A<br>
computer terminal 130 of an agent may be a smart terminal or a dumb terminal, depending<br>
upon the configuration of the server 140 and the terminals 130. However, lor convenience<br>
and brevity, and not by way of limitation, the computer terminals 110 and 130 will be<br>
referred to as PCs The various PCs and servers are preferably connected via the Internet<br>
150. However, it will be appreciated that the PC 130 of an agent 120 may be directly<br>
connected to a server 140, such as is shown by by connection 170 coanecting PC 130N to<br>
server 140N. Furthermore, it will also be appreciated that the a server may be directly<br>
connected to one or more other servers, such as is shown by connection 180 connecting<br>
server 140B to server 140N. Therefore, other than the customer"s PC 110 being connected<br>
to a server 140N through the internet ISO, me various connections among and between the<br>
servenl40 and the -PCs 120 may be via Internet ISO or via any other convenient<br>
method. For brevity, the discussion below presumes that all communications are via the<br>
Internet ISO.<br>
A customer 100 wishes to conduct a communication with an agent 120 for a variety<br>
of reasons, such as to obtain information about or to purchase a product or service, inquire<br>
about upgrades to a product, register the purchase of a product or service, report a problem,<br>
schedule a repair, etc. The customer 100 will then use PC HO to access the server, for<br>
example 140A, of the company and log into a one-to-one Internet chat session with an<br>
agent, forgaanple, 120A. When the customer 100 logs into the chat session on the server<br>
140A, the server 140Asends a mini-agplication, such as an executable code module, to the<br>
PC 110 of the customer 100. This mini-application instates itself onto tire elastomer"s<br>
Internet browser program, and then a chat window or frame appeals on the screen of the<br>
customer"s PC. The customer then shows op m a servicequeue (also known as a service<br>
line) until an agent becomes available. When an agent becomes available the customer will<br>
show up on the agent"s screen in the service queue. The agent then selects (picks-up) the<br>
customer and the chat session begins.<br>
Once the costomer 100 is connected to the agent 120ATitle customer 100 explains<br>
the reason for the communication. The agent 120A may be able to handle the<br>
communication, or may simply be the gateway, or may not be able to assist the customer<br>
100. In the later two cases, me agent 120A may deem it necessary mat the customer 100<br>
communicate with a different agent, for example, 120B, or even with an agent of another<br>
company, for example agent 120N. The agent 120A will then determine to whatserver 140<br>
or chat session within a server mat the customer 100 should be transferred. Preferably, the<br>
agent will also advise the customer that the transfer will occur and obtain the customer"s<br>
consent The agent will then cause the PC 130A to send the destination URL and a warm<br>
transfer ID number or code (WTID) for mat server or chat session to the PC 110 of the<br>
customer 100.<br>
The mini-application mentioned above, upon receiving the destination URL and the<br>
WTID, causes the internet browser program of the PC to reload or update, and therefore go<br>
to that new destination URL. That new destination URL may be for a chat session with<br>
agent 120B, may be for a chat session with the agent 120N of a completely different<br>
company, may be the destination URL for an introductory chat session, ox may be a service<br>
queue for mat different oompany or server. The mini-application then causes a log-in to the<br>
transferred URL, and men sends the WTID as an identification uumber to the transferred<br>
URL.<br>
For example, the customer 100 may start out with general question about the PC 110<br>
that the customer purchased from the company A, and these questions may be answered by<br>
the agent 120A. However, the customer 100, men proceeds to ask more technical questions<br>
about the hardware, so the agent 120A determines the proper agent 120B to answer the<br>
questions, and the PC 130A then sends the destination URL for a chat session with agent<br>
120B to the PC 110, and the PC 110 then uses that destination URL to begin a new chat<br>
session with agent 120B. The customer 100 then asks a question about the operating system<br>
software, which is provided by another company B. The agent 120B then determines the<br>
proper chat session for company B, the PC 130B then sends the destination URL for a new<br>
chat session wiih an agent 120N for company B, and the PC 110 then usges that destination<br>
URL to begin a new chat session with agent 120N for company B.<br>
therefore, the customer 100 has been transferred without any effort or action by the<br>
customer 100, to chat sessions with the various agents 120 who are able to assist the<br>
customer.<br>
However, it is also desirable flat the customer not have to re-enter information on<br>
each transfer. Therefore, m one embodiment, at each transfer, all of the correspondence and<br>
information from the present chat session is forwarded to the new chat session.<br>
In anomer embodiment, me agent has the option of causing all, some, or none of the<br>
information from me present chat session to be forwarde to the new chat session. This is<br>
advantageous when the customer may have provided certain personal information, such as<br>
an account number or credit card number, which was needed for the first chat session, but<br>
there may not be a need for that information in the new chat session For example, where the<br>
customer has provided a credit card number to purchase a product of service a upgrade in<br>
the first chat session, and where the chat session is to be transferred to the agent of another,<br>
unrelated company.<br>
In still another embodiment, none of the correspondence and information from the<br>
present chat session is forwarded to the new chat session.<br>
In still another embodiment, the determination of whether all of the correspondence<br>
and information is to be transferred, whether the agent has the option to transfer all, some or<br>
none of the correspondence and information, or whether none of the correspondence and<br>
information is to be transferred, may be based upon to where the customer is to be<br>
transferred. For example, if the chat session is to be transferred to another agent in the same<br>
department, such as a supervisor. then all of the correspondence and information may be<br>
automatically transferred. However, if the chat session is to be transferred to another agent<br>
in the same company, then the agent on the present chat session may have the option of<br>
what is to be transferred. Further, if the chat session is to be transferred to an agent of<br>
another company, then none of the correspondence and information will be transferred.<br>
Other tests and controls for determining whether all, an optional amount, or none of<br>
the correspondence and information are to be transferred maybe devised based upon the<br>
particular needs and business of the company. When agent 120A determines mat the<br>
customer and the chat session should be transferred, the agent 120 will press a key, or<br>
click on a pull down menu, which causes a window to appear for the option of transferring<br>
determine whether agent 120A, PC 130A, or server 140A is authorized to transfer a chat<br>
session to server 140B.<br>
If agent 120A,, PC 130A, or server 140A is authorized to transfer a chat session to<br>
server 140B and a specific chat area has been requested then the server 140A will<br>
determine whether mat chat session area is authorized and whether that chat session area is<br>
currently available. If a specific chat session area was not requested, men me server 140B<br>
will respond with a list of the authorized and available chat session areas. The agent 120A<br>
can then select the desired chat session area from the fist.<br>
In another embodiment, me server 140B does not identify specific chat session areas<br>
or respond to a request for a specific chat session area, but simply has a single input<br>
gateway for a general introductory chat session.<br>
Once the specific chat session area or general chat session, as appropriate, has been<br>
identified, the server 140B will send a destination URL and WTID to the PC 130A. This<br>
destination URL may be for mat specific chat session or agent or may merely identify the<br>
destination server or a service queue on the destination server. For example, a specific<br>
destination URL may be "mycompany.com/sofrware/chat/197463D", whereas a less-<br>
specific destination URL may be "mycompany.com/software/chat". The WTID identifies<br>
the particular customer.<br>
The destination URL and the WTID may be used together, or independently. The<br>
example above is where boyh are used. In another embodiment, the destination URL may be<br>
so specific as to adequately identify both the customer and the documents associated with<br>
that customer, and so the WTID is not required. In still another embodiment, the URL is not<br>
very specific and merely identifies the destination server or a service queue on the<br>
destination server, and so the WTID identifies the particular customer and the documents<br>
associated with that customer. Of course, both a specifc destination URL and a WTID may<br>
be used so as to provide extra security or checking that the customer has been matched with<br>
the correct documents and information.<br>
As mentioned above, when the PC 130A receives the destination URL and/or the<br>
WTID from the server 140B, the PC 130A will then, automatically, or at the request of the<br>
server 140A, or at the request of the server 140B, or at the request of the agent 120 A, send<br>
the destination URL and/or the WTID to the customer"s PC 110, and will also, if<br>
appropriate, send all or part of the current chat session information and any other documents<br>
or information to that destination URL at server 140B. Then, when the customer 100 arrives<br>
at the server 140B, the transferred information and documents, if appropriate, arrive at the<br>
server 140B, and an agent 120N becomes available at the server 140B, the server 140B will<br>
connect the customer 100 to the agent 120N and present the transferred information to the<br>
agent 120N.<br>
Therefore, the customer has not had to re-enter any information or re-transmit any<br>
documents, even though the customer has been trabsferred from a chat session on a server at<br>
one company to a different chat session on a different server at a different company.<br>
Figure 2A-2B are a flowchart of the operation of a PC 130, for example PC 130 A,<br>
according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Upon start-up, or agent<br>
120A log-in, the PC gets 200 the list of servers and/or chat areas, if available, from its<br>
designated server, such as server 140A. The list may be names, URLs, hyperlinks, a subject<br>
matter identifier identifying the subject handled by a particular server, etc., or a combination<br>
of two or more of the above as desirable to allow the agent to quickly and easily identify the<br>
best destination for the chat session. Not shown, but understood, are the steps of verifying<br>
and completing the log-in and connecting the agent 120A to a customer 100 for a chat<br>
session. At some point during the chat session the agent may determine that the customer<br>
should be transferred to a chat session with another agent The PC monitors 205 for a<br>
request from the agent to transfer the customer to a chat session win another agent If the<br>
agent does not make a request then the present chat session continues 207 and the PC<br>
continues to monitor 205 for a request<br>
If the agent makes the request men the PC presents 210 a session transfer dialogue<br>
box which has any available options for the agent, and also a list of servers aad/or chat<br>
session areas if available. The Figures 6 A and 6B are examples of a dialogue box presented<br>
to the agent The transfer options may include whether to send all, none, or part of a chat<br>
session or a document or information obtained by the agent However, a system rule, or a<br>
role based upon the particular agent or the chat session or the destination server may force<br>
"all" or "none" and eliminate options for the agent with respect to the transfer of<br>
information and documents. In addition to transferring the text of the session, the agent may<br>
want to transfer particular comments to the new agents. These comments can be entered in a<br>
dialogue or comments box Further, in the dialogue box the agent may simply cut and paste<br>
a portion of the session. The PC then monitors 215 for the selection of a destination server<br>
or a destination chat session area, if available.<br>
If file agent cancels the request, then the present chat session continues 217 and tbe<br>
PC continues to monitor 205 for a request<br>
If the agent makes a selection of the destination then the PC sends 220 a request for<br>
permission to transfer the chat session, such as an HTTP request, and also sends an<br>
identification code or other identifying criteria to the destination server. If available chat<br>
session areas have previously been identified, such as at step 200, then tbe desired chat<br>
session area is also indicated. If only a server has been identified, then the request from the<br>
PC also includes a request for the identification of the chat sessions which are available<br>
from that server.<br>
The PC then monitors 225 for permission to transfer the chat session. If permission<br>
is not granted then the present chat session continues 227.<br>
If permission is granted then the PC will receive 230 an authorization code from the<br>
destination server. In addition, if the chat session areas were not previously available, tbe<br>
PC will also receive a list of available chat session areas. If not previously presented and<br>
selected, the PC will then select a chat session area designation from the agent The PC then<br>
sends ("posts") the warm transfer information and authorization code to the destination<br>
server. The warm transfer information that the PC sends preferably includes the following:<br>
originating server name, agent name, customer name, customer email address, subject, log-<br>
in time, client type, transferring queue name (such as the name of the specific chat area),<br>
any priority recommendation, transfer notes, transfer transcripts, documents referenced<br>
during the present chat session, etc.<br>
The PC then monitors 235 for acceptance by the destination server. Acceptance may<br>
be indicated in any desired manner, but should also include the WTID and the destination<br>
URL for the transfer (the transfer URL). If the destination server does not accept (refusal, or<br>
no timely response) then the transfer attempt is terminated and the present chat session<br>
continues 237.<br>
If the destination server does accept then the PC 240 sends the destination URL and<br>
the WTID to the customer"s PC and also sends a notice of tbe transfer and the destination<br>
URL to its own server 140A. This terminates the present chat session and frees the agent up<br>
for another chat session. Although reference is made above to the PC taking certain actions,<br>
such as sending the information and documents to the destination server, it should be<br>
appreciated mat these functions may also be performed by the first server 140A.<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart of toe operation of the originating server according to the<br>
preferred embodiment of the presort invention. The originating server controls log-in by the<br>
customer, sending the mini-application to the customer, controlling whether a warm transfer<br>
is permitted, and executing the roles pertaining to the transfer of documents and other<br>
information. The originating server also serves as a conduit lor the agent"s PC 130 although,<br>
as explained above, some of the fractions described above may be performed by either the<br>
agent"s PC or the originating server.<br>
The originating server, such as 140A, accepts 300 the customer"s log-in and sends<br>
the mini-application to the customer. The server also accepts the agent"s log-in and men<br>
sends the Hat of step 200 to the agent"s PC. The server men monitors 305 for a request to<br>
transfer the chat session.<br>
If the agent has requested a transfer of the chat session the server tests 310 whether<br>
such a transfer is permitted. Permission or denial may be across the board for all agents, or<br>
may be on a selective basis, as described above. If the transfer is denied then the server<br>
sends 315 a denial of me request<br>
If the transfer is permitted then the server waits 320 for the transfer notice and<br>
transfer URL from the agent"s PC<br>
Once mis information is received men the server creates 325 a warm transfer page<br>
with an embedded "refresh" command, with the destination URL to be used as the refresh<br>
URL, with the WTID, and then sends this page to the customer"s PC. This ends the active<br>
participation of the first agent 120A and the originating server 140 A, unless the originating<br>
server 140A also happens to be me destination server for that customer, such as when an<br>
agent in different department is involved.<br>
The originating server also performs other duties, such as presenting prompts and<br>
any appropriate options for the agent, conducting or coordinating the transfer of the chat<br>
session information and documents butween the agent"s PC 130A, the originating server<br>
140A, and the destination server 140B, etc..<br>
Figures 4A and 4B are a flowchart of the operation of the receiving server according<br>
to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The receiving server, such as server<br>
140B, monitors 400 for a request for a transfer. If a request is received the server checks 405<br>
the credentials of the requester to verify that the requester is authorized to do a warm<br>
transfer. The credentials may be, for example, the name, electronic address, or other<br>
identification of the requester, the name, electronic address, or other identification of the<br>
server associated with the requester. If the requester is not authorized, the server sends 410 a<br>
denial of the warm transfer.<br>
If the requester is authorized then the server determines 415 the allowed chat session<br>
areas or list, and sends this list, along with an authorization code, to the requester, that is,<br>
the PC 130A of the agent 120A.<br>
The server then monitors 420 for the receipt of customer information with a valid<br>
authorization code. If the authorization code is invalid then the server denies 425 the<br>
transfer.<br>
If the authorization code is valid then fee server accents 430 the customer<br>
information, creates a warm-transfer chat session, and then sends the destination URL and<br>
the WTID for the new chat session to the requester. The server then waits for the transferred<br>
customer log-in to the transfer URL address.<br>
In one embodiment, when the customer logs-in, the server accepts 435 the<br>
transferred customer log-in, checks me WTID sent by the customer"s PC, creates a warm<br>
transfer chat session, associates the customer information previously provided by the agent<br>
with the customer using the WTID or the destination URL, if sufficiently specific, men<br>
terminates the warm transfer session without terminating the connection with the customer,<br>
and notifies the queue manager that the transferred customer is waiting. The queue manager,<br>
which may be running on the server or naming on a different computer system, men places<br>
the transferred customer in the proper location in the queue. The proper location may be<br>
based upon the tone at which the transferred customer logged-in, may be based upon the<br>
time at which me server notified the queue manager, may be based upon the fact that the<br>
customer is a transferred customer, or any other desired criteria for determining the priority<br>
mat is to be assigned to this customer. The server, or the queue manager if different,<br>
determines 440 when an agent is available for a chat session with the customer.<br>
When an agent, such as agent 120N becomes available, the server creates 445 a new<br>
warm transfer page with an embedded refresh command and a destination URL<br>
corresponding to the new chat session to be started, and then sends the warm-transfer page<br>
to the customer"s PC 110 to begin the transferred chat session. The server may also create a<br>
new WTID, if appropriate or desired, associates the customer information with mat new<br>
WTID, and sends me new WTID, as part of the warm transfer page, along with the<br>
destination URL. Not shown, but implied, are the steps of connecting the available agent to<br>
the chat session and connecting the customer to the chat session when the customer logs-in<br>
to the new refresh URL.<br>
When a warm transfer page is seat, or "poshed" to the customer"s PC 110, it<br>
includes a command that when received causes the mint-application to execute. The mini-<br>
application can be any one of the many available forms such as a Java™ applet, an Active-<br>
X™ or HTML command, etc. The mim-apptication executes the command to refresh the<br>
web page on the screen of the customer"s PC, but substitutes a new URL, the destination<br>
URL, as me refresh address. Thus, when me refresh command is executed, the customer is<br>
transported to the destination URL for me new chat session.<br>
In another embodiment, when the customer logs-in, the server accepts 435 the<br>
transferred customer log-in, checks me WTID sent by the customer"s PC, creates a warm<br>
transfer chat session, associates the customer information previously provided by the agent<br>
with the customer using me WTID or the destination URL, if sufficiently specific, and<br>
notifies the queue manager that the transferred customer is waiting. The customer men<br>
shows up in a service queue on the destination server until an agent becomes available.<br>
When an agent becomes available the customer will show-up on the agent"s screen in the<br>
service queue. The agent then selects (picks-up) the customer, the server sends the<br>
customer"s information to the agent"s PC for display to me agent, and the new chat session<br>
begins. Thus, in this embodiment, the warm transfer session of step 435 is not terminated,<br>
and, in step 445, a second warm transfer page is not created and the customer is not<br>
transferred again but, instead, the agent merely joins the already existing chat session.<br>
However, again, the agent is fully informed, by the customer information and documents, of<br>
the reason mat the customer is in the chat session. Thus, the present invention also<br>
contemplates a one-step warm transfer.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart of the operation of the customer"s PC according to the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. When the customer logs-in to the<br>
originating server for a chat session, a mini application is loaded 500 onto the customers<br>
computer.<br>
During the one-on-one Internet chat, the PC 110 receives 505 a warm transfer web<br>
page from the originating server 140A, and mis web page contains the destination URL<br>
and/or the WTID. The customer"s PC then retrieves the destination URL, substitutes the<br>
destination URL for present URL in the web browser program, and then causes the web<br>
browser program to execute a refresh command (sometimes called an "update" or a ""reload"<br>
command). The mini-application also logs-in to the destination server, and sends the WTID,<br>
if any, to the destination server. Thus, when the refresh command it executed, it is to the<br>
destination URL, rather man to the original URL, and so the customer is transported<br>
effortlessly to the new, destination URL, without having to enter a new address, or even to<br>
log-in to the new server.<br>
Figures 6A and 6B are an illustration of the transfer screen that an agent sees in the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
When an agent determines mat a chat session is to be transferred, the agent clicks on<br>
or selects a "Transfer Call" button (not shown). The Transfer Call button allows the Agent<br>
to transfer a chat session to another agent, to a supervisory agent, or another server, or to<br>
send a customer back to any service queue which is currently staffed by one or more agents.<br>
The agent preferably cannot transfer a customer to a service queue which is not staffed, or<br>
transfer the customer to a specific agent who is not currently online. Furthermore, the agent<br>
preferably cannot transfer a chat session to an agent who is already handling the maximum<br>
number of allowed simultaneous chat sessions, which is six in the preferred embodiment<br>
Clicking on the Transfer Call button brings up the Transfer Call screen of Figure 6A.<br>
A window shows all of the agents who are presently online. Notice the faded icon for agent<br>
Aamir, which is the Agent"s login name in this example. To transfer a chat session to<br>
another agent, the agent selects the agent to whom the chat session is to be transferred. The<br>
agent can also enter text in the Comments field. The agent then clicks on the Transfer button<br>
(grayed out because a destination agent has not yet been selected in. the illustration), and the<br>
chat session is transferred. The background of me window preferably provides an indication<br>
mat the chat session has been transferred, such as by changing the background field from<br>
white to gray.<br>
To transfer a call to one of the service queues the agent clicks on the button labeled<br>
"Service Line". A list of available service queues appears in the field, along with the<br>
number of agents and customers in the service queues. The agent then selects the service<br>
queue to which the chat session is to be transferred and clicks on the Transfer button<br>
(grayed out because a destination service queue has not yet been selected in the illustration),<br>
and the chat session is transferred. The background of the window preferably provides an<br>
indication that me chat session has been transferred, such as by changing the background<br>
field from white to gray.<br>
server along with the destination or holding URL, or the WTID, or some other identification<br>
of the customer. Other methods of providing for the destinatinon server to know the current<br>
web page of the customer"s PC may also be used.<br>
In another embodiment, the receiving server, at step 430, does not send the warm<br>
transfer ID unless an agent is available. In this embodiment, if at step 430 an agent is not<br>
available, then the requesting agent is sent a denial of service, preferably with an indication<br>
that the denial is due to the lack of an available agent and that the agent can attempt a<br>
transfer again later. This denial may be with, or without, a refusal to accept the customer<br>
information. Then, when an agent becomes available, step 430 is executed, that the<br>
destination URL is not to a service queue, but is directly to the URL for the new chat<br>
session with the watting and available agent Then, sub-steps 1,2 and 3 of 435 and sub-step<br>
3 of step 445 are executed.<br>
Of course, as with contact center pacing algorithms, agent availability may be based<br>
on actual availability or predicted availability, and predicted availability may be based upon<br>
any of those factors in contact center pacing algorithms which have an analogous factor in<br>
chat session communicationa, for example, but not by way of limitation, the number of<br>
agents on duty, the average, peak or other chat session time, the number of customers in the<br>
holding queue or queues, etc.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment refers to sending the mini-application at an early<br>
point in the communication, such as when the customer first logs-in to the first server, the<br>
present invention is not so limited. The mini-application may be sent at any point while the<br>
customer"s PC and the server are in communication. For example, the mini-application may<br>
be sent when the customer first logs-in, or when the customer and the agent first begin<br>
communicating, or when the agent determines that the customer should be transferred, or<br>
even just before the agent terminates the communication with the customer. Similarly, when<br>
the customer is at the holding URL, the mini-application may be sent when the customer<br>
first logs in to the holding URL, or just prior to transfer to the new chat session, or at any<br>
time while the customer"s PC is in communication with the destination server. Further, once<br>
loaded onto the customer"s PC, the mini-application may reside thereon indefinitely or until<br>
some predetermined event occurs. Thus, the customer may be repeatedly transferred, if<br>
necessary, by sending a new destination URL, rather than sending the mini-application for<br>
each transfer. The mini-application monitors for the occurrence of a specified event and<br>
terminates itself when the event occurs. Some examples of predetermined events to<br>
automatically terminate the mini-application are: the customer takes action to log<br>
onto a new site, the customer terminates Internet activity; an elapsed time has<br>
expired, a time certain has expired; a command from a server or agent has been<br>
sent to delete the mini-application, etc.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, secure communications are used to transfer<br>
the customer information, the transfer URL, the WTID, and other sensitive<br>
information.<br>
The present invention is also useful for load balancing,: If, for example, it<br>
step 440, an agent is not available, or most but not all of the agents are busy<br>
and a reserve capacity is desired, the receiving server may send a new web page<br>
to the customer which causes the customer to "refresh* to a backup server, or<br>
secondary server, or another server which has the agent or capability to handle<br>
the call in a more timely manner.<br>
It will therefore be appreciated that the present invention provides for the<br>
transfer of a customer from a first chat session on a first server to a new chat<br>
session on a second server without any action whatsoever on the part of the<br>
customer, not even requiring the simple click of a mouse or a single keystroke.<br>
Further, the second server may be the same server as the first server or may be<br>
different from the first server and may be physically located in another city,<br>
state, country, or continent. In addition, the second server may be the server of<br>
an independent company. Further, all of, some of, selected parts of, or none of,<br>
the first chat session notes, documents, correspondence, etc., may be<br>
transferred from the first chat session and server to the second chat session and<br>
server. In addition, the customer may be transferred from one chat session to<br>
another chat session until the customer has received all of the aid or information<br>
or other action that the customer desires.<br>
Therefore, the scope of the present invention is to be limited only by the<br>

A customer is transferred from a first Internet chat session on a first server to a<br>
second Internet chat session on a second server without the customer having to<br>
take any action whatsoever. The second server may be the same server as the<br>
First server or may be different from the first server and may be physically<br>
located in another city, state, country, or continent. When the need arises to<br>
transfer a customer chat to another agent (who may be on another server) the<br>
agent requests a transfer and a list of available chat sessions is provided (300) to<br>
the agent. If the agent requests a transfer of the customer to one of those<br>
available chat sessions then a determination (310) is made as to whether the<br>
proposed transfer is permitted. If the transfer is permitted and initiated by the<br>
agent, the agent"s computer sends all the transfer information as well as a<br>
transfer command to the customers browser. The command sent activates a<br>
mini-application residing on the customer"s browser that seamlessly connects the<br>
customer to a new URL for a second chat session. Further, when the transfer is<br>
initiated, all or a portion of the information, including documentation, from the<br>
first chat session is simultaneously transferred to the second chat session.</td>
