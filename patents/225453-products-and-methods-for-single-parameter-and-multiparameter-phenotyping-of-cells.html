				<td>This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/132,395<br>
filed May 4, 1999. The contents of said Provisional Application Serial No. 60/132,395 are<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to phenotyping and immunophenotyping of cells<br>
and more particularly to single parameter and multiparameter phenotyping and immunophenotyping<br>
of cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Immunophenotyping of cells and tumors, particularly hematopoietic tumors, is often of<br>
critical importance for clinical evaluation of cancer patients. However, currently available<br>
'methodologies, particularly flow cytometry, are expensive and require a high degree of suspicion at<br>
the time of biopsy. All too often, even before the diagnosis of cancer is made, precious tissue<br>
must be set aside for possible immunophenotyping. If tissue is not set aside and there is cancer<br>
present, the correct subtyping of the tumor (and proper assignment to treatment protocols) cannot<br>
be done after the fact. Methods that do not require forethought, such as inununostaining of<br>
paraffin blocks, are far less sensitive and do not work well in laboratories that do not perform these<br>
stains frequently. Flow cytometry is the currently accepted "gold standard" for<br>
immunophenotyping of hematopoietic cell types.. However, there are several problems with the<br>
method. The expense of establishing and maintaining these laboratories is perhaps the most severe<br>
problem. Generally large hospitals, academic centers, or commercial reference laboratories are the<br>
only institutions capable of establishing cytometry laboratories. These laboratories often<br>
charge a premium for their services, and transportation of specimens to laboratories is not a trivial<br>
problem. Since flow cytometry requires live cells, specimens must be handled under sterile<br>
conditions. In laboratories where the technology is unavailable, a fresh specimen has to be<br>
prepared and shipped to a flow cytometry laboratory under sterile conditions for evaluation.<br>
Uncontrollable factors such as temperature variations, rough handling, bacterial contamination, or<br>
shipping delays may render samples unsuitable for analysis. In addition, flow cytometry requires<br>
technologists who have specialized training and their time must often be dedicated solely to the<br>
technology itself, further increasing the expense of the procedure. Relatively large volumes of cells<br>
must be analyzed in order to obtain statistically meaningful results during analysis. In addition, red<br>
cells must be removed from the sample prior to analysis. This is because the number of red cells<br>
in blood and bone marrow samples is far greater than other cells types, and shear numbers alone<br>
would overwhelm the sensitive detectors of the machines. The sample preparation method<br>
therefore requires Ficoll-Hypaque separation, followed by multiple washes, followed by a lysis step<br>
to lyse remaining red cells. This method virtually eliminates megakaryocytes from most analysis<br>
and frequently destroys delicate malignant cells (particularly from the relatively common tumors<br>
such as large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease). It is in these situations that the great<br>
sensitivity and complexity of flow cytometry may work to its disadvantage.<br>
Despite the problems described above, however, flow cytometry can very accurately and<br>
with great sensitivity identify the presence of malignant cells and characterize the kino or malignant<br>
cells. Without the information that flow cytometry provides, cases can be frequently incorrectly<br>
diagnosed with catastrophic consequences for the patient. This is particularly true in the setting of<br>
a type of biopsy called fine needle aspiration where examination of a slide alone by light<br>
microscopy may be quite difficult.<br>
What would be very useful to the average hospital pathologist or to any physician in an<br>
outpatient or remote setting is a device or kit that would allow the same kind of single parameter or<br>
multiparameter analysis of samples using cheaper, more readily available materials. This would<br>
eliminate the need for specialized laboratories and technologists dedicated solely to the flow<br>
cytometry technology itself and would allow any well trained clinical laboratorian ready access to<br>
the same kind of analysis. Furthermore, if the need for live cells could be eliminated, cells could<br>
be preserved by appropriate fixatives which would broaden the availability of immunophenotyping<br>
data.<br>
Over the last 20 years there has been a tremendous growth in the identification and<br>
characterization of molecules expressed by blood cells on their cell membranes (called cell surface<br>
antigens). This growth in understanding has been accompanied by the refinement of technologies<br>
that allow the rapid and sensitive identification of these molecules on the surfaces of live cells.<br>
However, the overwhelming majority of these cell surface antigens are not unique to one type of<br>
cell. There is only rarely a single diagnostic marker to identify a cell type. Instead, most cell<br>
populations must be characterizing by analyzing multiple parameters at the same time.<br>
Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system that have the property that<br>
they bind to a singe specific molecule (referred to as an antigen). Antigen-antibody complexes are<br>
formed when an antibody binds its respective antigen. Normally, these complexes are then cleared<br>
by the immune system to rid the body of an infection. However, the immune system has a<br>
virtually limitless capacity to produce unique antibodies, which can be tailored to identify particular<br>
substances, even when present in very small quantities. Antibodies are now commercially<br>
produced to literally hundreds of different antigens. Furthermore, antibodies can be easily tagged<br>
with marker molecules, such as fluorescent molecules, dyes, or other substances that make<br>
identifying the presence of an antigen-antibody complex a relatively simple matter. This well-<br>
known biochemical reaction has been used to develop a methodology called flow cylometry. In<br>
flow cytometry. intact cells are treated with antibodies that bind specific markers on the cell<br>
surface. The antibodies are, in turn, labeled with a fluorescent molecule and the cell suspension<br>
then flows past a light beam with a light detector which counts the number of fluorescent cells<br>
versus the other cells present. This technology has proved tremendously useful in identifying<br>
malignant cell populations in blood and tissue samples from patients.<br>
In flow cytometry, a cell suspension is treated with antibodies labeled with fluorescent<br>
molecules (fluorochromes), washed, and placed in the machine. The cell suspension is "focused"<br>
using buffer solutions so that the cells pass through the flow detector in a single file. When each<br>
cell passes through the flow detector, a beam of laser light is passed through the cell. Some of the<br>
light passes through the cell (called forward light scatter) and some is refracted at an angle (called<br>
side scatter). Forward scatter increases with a celt's size and side scatter increases with a cell's<br>
internal complexity (mostly granules within the cytoplasm). Thus using just these two<br>
measurements, individual cell types can be roughly categorized. However, there are also light<br>
detectors, which, by using appropriate color filters, can specifically detect the fluorescence given<br>
off by the antibodies that are attached to the cell surface. Since current state of the art machines<br>
have up to four different color detectors (referred to as four-color flow cytometry), up to four<br>
different antibodies can be added to the same tube. Samples from individual patients are usually<br>
divided into multiple tubes, each of which contains multiple antibodies. Data analysis is therefore<br>
quite complex, and requires computers that are capable of simultaneously displaying multiple plots<br>
from each tube. This is referred to as multinarameter analysis. This simultaneous analysis of<br>
multiple parameters is necessary to first electronically isolate and then characterize ceil populations.<br>
Therefore, even though modern flow cytometers analyze up to 6 simultaneous parameters (forward<br>
scatter, side scatter, and four antibodies) 3 of the parameters must be used for electronic isolation<br>
of cell types (forward scatter, side scatter, and CD4S staining intensity). Broad categories of cells<br>
present in hematologic samples are known in the art and include myeloid cells, monocytes,<br>
lymphocytes, megakaryocytes, and red cells. In other words, these 3 parameters must he used to<br>
roughly mimic what the human eye does so effortlessly: identify or characterize broad categories of<br>
cells. Indeed, laboratories commonly hire technicians with 2 years of training (only part of which<br>
is in the area of hematology) who can, with a very reasonable degree of accuracy and precision,<br>
identify or characterize different cell types present in blood samples. With some additional<br>
training, they can also correctly enumerate cell types within bone marrow aspirate samples. Thus<br>
if the human eye were also equipped with the means to also identify cell surface antigens, there<br>
would be no need for flow cytometry for this purpose. Furthermore, of the remaining 3<br>
parameters available for analysis on the flow cytometry, only 2 can be displayed in any one plot<br>
although new software exists that can display 3 dimensional plots. While 3 dimensional plots add<br>
to convenience and are applicable in limited situations, two parameter analysis is quite sufficient in<br>
most cases. This last point is critical, since any method that seeks to supplant flow cytometry must<br>
have the ability to characterize at least 2 cell surface markers simultaneously.<br>
Analysis of cell populations by flow cytometry is not a trivial process and requires highly<br>
trained personnel as outlined above. Both single parameter and multiparameter analysis can be<br>
performed. If data is analyzed as histogram plots of fluorescence of a single marker versus cell<br>
number, then one parameter analysis is being performed. Analyzing two such histograms of a<br>
single gated cell population could then be referred to as simultaneous single parameter analysis.<br>
An example of simultaneous single parameter analysis would involve the use of such plots to<br>
identify cell surface expression of both the B-cell marker CD20 and the light chain kappa.<br>
Analysis of the binding of each set of antibodies is independent of the other. In multiparameter<br>
analysis, the binding of the two antibodies are linked and are not independent. Analytical methods<br>
require the binding of both antibodies simultaneously brought together in a single histogram such as<br>
fluorescence 1 versus fluorescence 2. Characterization of the target cell population is best<br>
performed by analysis of this fluorescence 1 vs. fluorescence 2 plot and analyzing the binding<br>
characteristics of each of these antibodies together. This decreases the possibility of an error that<br>
would incorrectly analyze two overlapping cell populations as a single cell population.<br>
Finally, with the limited exception of DNA ploidy analysis, characterization of solid<br>
tumors and non-hematopoietic tumors is quite limited by flow cytometry. Often there are not well<br>
developed protocols for developing cell suspensions. In addition, tumor cells may be delicate and<br>
may not survive processing. In addition, many markers used for solid tumors such as vimentin or<br>
smooth muscle actin are intracytoplasmic antigens and may be difficult to assay by flow cytometry.<br>
In addition, most available markers for these other tumors are not specific markers for the tumors<br>
and many normal cells, including ceils present in the background of the available sample, may be<br>
strongly positive for the same markers. Therefore, interpretation of these kinds of samples without<br>
specific morphologic correlation is hazardous at best.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a cheaper, more accessible method for single<br>
parameter and multiparameter analysis of cell populations. This analysis is not limited to just cell<br>
surface markers but also optionally includes identifying active receptor sites on cell surfaces, loss<br>
of cell surface proteins, intracellular proteins, and intracellular nucleic acid sequences. One of the<br>
features of this invention is that the target cell population is being analyzed by preserving<br>
morphologic characteristics of the cells for analysis. In addition, it is also possible to count events<br>
to obtain specific cell numbers in relation to specific sample volume. Due to the many preparatory<br>
steps of flow cytometry, obtaining absolute cell numbers is not possible - only percentages of cells<br>
analyzed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, when a preferred range such a.s 5-25 is given, this means preferably at<br>
least 5 and, separately and independently, preferably not more than 25. The cells herein are<br>
preferably human cells. If a first group of cells does not include members of a second group of<br>
cells, and the second group of cells docs not include members of the first group of cells, the two<br>
groups do not overlap. "Visually distinguishable" includes visually distinguishable via light<br>
microscopy. Quantitate includes to estimate or enumerate or count the number of. Phenotyping<br>
includes immunophenotyping and genotyping.<br>
The invention uses beads. As used herein, beads means small particles or support<br>
surfaces, preferably microspheres, more preferably plastic microspheres, more preferably<br>
polystyrene microspheres (also referred to as latex beads or spheres or microspheres), which have<br>
preferably been coated with a binding substance or which are magnetic. As used in the claims,<br>
"first beads" includes beads which have been coated with a binding substance or which are<br>
magnetic. The bead may be any solid support surface or particle that can be suspended in an<br>
appropriate solution. Preferred beads are available as polystyrene microshperes from Bangs<br>
Laboratories, Fisher, IN. The bead sizes are preferably greater than 5 microns diameter,<br>
preferably 5.S-I0.3 microns, less preferably at least 5.5 or 10 or 12 microns and preferably not<br>
more than 12, 15, 20 or 30 microns diameter, far less preferably less than 5 microns, such as at<br>
least 1, 2 or 3 microns diameter. 5.5 and 10.3 micron beads are preferred. The beads can also be<br>
colored, such as red or blue, less preferably green, purple, orange, brown, yellow, or any other<br>
color. The beads are preferably coated with a binding substance, such as antibodies or<br>
immunoreactive proteins, or any molecule that can bind to, or interact with a cell surface in such a<br>
way as to bring the cell and the bead into contact or adherence with each other or to bind with each<br>
other; alternatively, the head can contact or bind with the cell surface through electrostatic charge<br>
interactions or magnetic interaction; aH of these concepts being covered by the terms "binding to"<br>
or "bind to". When a bead binds to a cell, it forms a bead-cell complex. In the invention the cell-<br>
bead interaction forms a targe enough complex to inhibit the passage through a filter containing<br>
pores of appropriate dimensions. The filters are preferably sized and selected such that unbound<br>
cells and beads will pass through the pores but bound cell-beads do not. These complexes are then<br>
transferred to a glass slide and stained with a variety of stains so as to render the complexes visible<br>
by routine, microscopy. The complexes and cells are examined and the cells are characterized.<br>
Examples of binding substances or reactive substances that may be used to coat the bead surface<br>
include, but are not limited to: antibodies to specific cell surface proteins, small molecules that bind<br>
receptors or other cell surface molecules such as IL-2 or GM-CSF, avidin, biotin, or beads may<br>
remain uncoated in suspension that can interact by other means with cells. The antibodies that can<br>
be used are those known in the art. Many such antibodies are available from commercial<br>
companies, such as Zymed Inc., South San Francisco, CA and Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA.<br>
Beads or micrpspheres can be made from a variety of substances including gold, ferritin,<br>
polyacrylamide, or polystyrene. The latter is among the preferred substances as beads can be made<br>
precisely to any size specification and can be uniformly conjugated to both molecular linker arms<br>
and reactive binding substances. Polystyrene microspheres (also known as "latex microspheres")<br>
may be prepared by methods known in the art which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Binding substances that can be used include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, antibody<br>
"cocktail" mixtures, antibody fragoents (such as Fc portions or Fab or Fab' fragments in either<br>
monovalent or divalent forms), small molecules that bind specific cell surface receptors, covalent<br>
and non-covalent linkers, and indirect adherence such as utilizing electrostatic or magnetic or<br>
paramagnetic attraction.<br>
The prior art includes U.S. Pats. 5,554,505; 5,348,859; 5,340,719; 5,231,005; 5,260,192;<br>
5,338,689; 5,256,532; and 5,501,949, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. These patents include discussions of using certain nucrospheres or beads for<br>
identification of cells. It is known in the art how to provide a suspension of cells in a liquid<br>
medium for analysis.<br>
A second feature of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is that it concentrates<br>
cells by using an appropriate filter without added manipulation of the cell suspension by cell lysis<br>
or added incubation steps of submicroscopic paramagnetic microspheres. The filters to be used in<br>
the invention can be any of those known in the art, such as gynecological filters from Cytec Corp.,<br>
Boxborough, MA. The filters preferably have a pore size larger than the beads being used so that<br>
all or most or substantial amounts of unbound beads and unbound cells pass through, but the pore<br>
size is preferably small enough so that all or most or substantial amounts of beads bound to cells<br>
are trapped on the filter, such as the filter pore size being about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 or 12<br>
microns larger than the bead size. Preferred filter pore sizes include 10-15, less preferably 7-20,<br>
7-30 or 7-40 micron pore sizes. Alternatively the filter pore sizes can be at least 15 or 20 microns.<br>
The filler is preferably mounted on a solid support, such as at the end of a tube through which the<br>
suspension can drain.<br>
A cell suspension is preferably prepared from a peripheral blood sample, a bone marrow<br>
aspirate, a fine needle aspirate, a lymph node biopsy, or a body site specimen. In the method<br>
described herein, single parameter, simultaneous single parameter, and true multiparameter analysis<br>
is possible which compares to the level of sophistication of analysis possible by flow cytometry.<br>
Beads that can be easily distinguished from each other optically either by size, color, or both can<br>
be added to a cell suspension either simultaneously or sequentially. Positive binding by the target<br>
cell population results in a bead-ceil complex that has a significantly larger physical size than either<br>
unbound cells or beads. These complexes can be then easily concentrated and separated from the<br>
rest of the solution using an appropriately sized filler containing pores of sufficient size to let<br>
unbound cells and beads to pass through while complexes remain on the filter. The method may<br>
also be used in reverse, in that abnormal cell populations may fail to bind beads while normal cells<br>
bind strongly. An example of this latter method can be found with the myelodysplastic disorders<br>
(MDS), which currently cannot be diagnosed by flow cytometry with any degree of reliability.<br>
Normal human myeloid cells strongly express surface markers such as CD1 lb, CO13, CD1S,<br>
CD 16 and CD33. However, in MDS, these cell populations lose expression of these markers.<br>
However, as normal cells degenerate from prolonged storage or poor specimen handling such as<br>
temperature extremes, which may occur in specimen transport, they also lose expression of these<br>
markers. Flow cytometry cannot distinguish between these two conditions. However, degenerated<br>
cells are easily recognized morphologically from the dyspiastic cells of MDS. Loss of binding by<br>
beads coated with antibodies to these markers could easily be identified (with a slide made of the<br>
cells passing through the filter as well as those trapped on the filter). Therefore, this method is the<br>
first easily available method to diagnose MDS, heretofore only diagnosable in those minority of<br>
cases showing abnormal cytogenetics or persistent hematologic abnormalities after prolonged<br>
clinical follow up. As an example of MDS analysis, one can look at a peripheral smear. If the<br>
cells are degenerated, get a new sample. If the cells are not degenerated, incubate the cell<br>
suspension with large beads coated with anti-CD13. Then add small beads coated with anti-CD 15<br>
and let react. Then filter (can be small pore size to trap both bound and unbound cells, or large<br>
pore size to trap bound cells only, in which case unbound ceils are collected from what went<br>
through the filter). If the result is lots of complexes like Fig. 3 and few unbound cells, this<br>
indicates normal cells. If there are few bound cells and many unbound cells, this suggests MDS.<br>
Immature cells also have weak binding, but this can be seen morphologically. The same procedure<br>
can be done with CD1 lb and CD16.<br>
One can also count beads trapped on the filter prior to transfer to the glass slide. Using<br>
methods such as light scattering, reflectance, fluorescence, or electrostatic field changes, the<br>
number of beads trapped on the filter can be counted. An average number of ceils bound to each<br>
bead can be obtained and an estimate of the number of cells in the original sample volume<br>
obtained.<br>
With reference to Fig. I there is shown, not to scale, a bead 2, such as a polystyrene<br>
microsphere. which has coated thereon and bound thereto a binding substance 4 such as an<br>
antibody. There is also a cell 6, such as a target cell, which has a cell surface marker 8. The<br>
binding substance 4 or antibody binds to the cell surface marker 8 on the target cell 6. Fig. 2<br>
illustrates how this kind of reaction may appear on a glass slide; a group of cells or target cells 12<br>
have bound to a bead 10. This shows single parameter binding of cells to beads. The ratio of<br>
beads to cells should be adjusted properly for effective results. The actual number of cells binding<br>
the bead is variable, ranging from a single cell to numerous cells crowding the bead's surface.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3 there is shown a large bead 14 coated with a binding substance<br>
which has bouod to eight cells 16, 18, 20, 22. Small beads or different colored beads 24 coated<br>
with a different binding substance have bound to the cells 22 but not to the cells 16, 18, 20. This<br>
provides positive identification of target cells 22. This illustrates multiparameter analysis. Cells 22<br>
is a subset of cells 16, 18, 20, 22. A variable number of beads 24 can bind to each cell 22. la<br>
some cases each cell bound to bead 14 will be bound to one or more beads 24, or each cell bound<br>
to bead 14 may be unbound to small beads. Note that different kinds of cells may bind to the large<br>
bead 14 that can in some cases be distinguished morphologically. Preferably the large bead 14 is<br>
added first to the cell suspension so that a plurality of cells can bind to its surface. Then the small<br>
beads 24 are added to bind to the periphery of the complex. Alternatively small beads 24 can be<br>
added first or small beads 24 and large beads 14 can be added simultaneously. The order of<br>
addition is dependent in large part upon the relative concentrations and surface areas of the beads<br>
and the cells. For example, you would not want to add beads 14 or 24 in such concentrations that<br>
they completely cover or obscure the surface area of the target cells and thus prevent access thereto<br>
by the other beads. Preferably there is an excess of target cells to fully coat the bead. Optionally<br>
the suspension can be filtered after the first complex is formed, to trap the first complex and<br>
resuspend it before the second beads are added. Thus a group of complexes can be filtered and<br>
resuspended before a subsequent set of beads is added; this can lead to more certain and distinct<br>
results by removing materials which would provide interference. The beads may be distinguishable<br>
in size or color or both. Further levels of multiparameter analysis can also be carried out, such as<br>
by adding to Fig. 3 another set of different sized or different colored beads which would bind to a<br>
first subset of cells 22 but not the remaining cells 22, thus providing positive identification of said<br>
first subset of cells 22. In this manner subsequent or additional levels of multiparameter analysis<br>
can be carried out.<br>
There is a wide variety of available beads that can be used, and those selected would<br>
depend on the specific application. In multiparameter analysis beads that can be easily<br>
distinguished by either size or color are preferable. For example, two sets of colorless beads sized<br>
10 and 5 microns respectively can be used to isolate a population of B cells using 10 micron beads<br>
coated with an anti-pan B cell antigen such as CD 19 and 5 micron beads coated with anti-kappa.<br>
Multiparameter analysis that cannot be easily mimicked by flow cytometry is available by a minor<br>
variation of this example. Colorless 10 micron beads are used to bind B cells by using anti-CD 19<br>
coated beads. 5-micron colorless beads are coated with anti-kappa while dark blue 5-micron beads<br>
are coaled with anti-lambda. Similarly, a blast cell population can be analyzed using anti-CD34<br>
coaled 10 micron beads and anti-CD 19 coated colorless S micron'beads. Colored 5-micron beads<br>
coated with anti-CD 13 are simultaneously added fur rapid characterization of most blast ceil<br>
populations.<br>
Preferred methods:<br>
1) Substantially identical beads are purchased commercially precoated with strepavidin (Bangs<br>
Laboratories, Fishers, IN). A small quantity is suspended in any buffered salt solution such as<br>
phosphate buffered saline or commercially available antibody diluent. The beads are incubated with<br>
biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibodies for 30 minutes (however, any biotinylated anti-allogeneic<br>
antibody may be used). The suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant drawn off. The<br>
incubation is repeated two times to ensure coating of as much of the available surface area of the<br>
beads as possible. The beads are then washed three times using the same buffer. The suspension<br>
is then incubated with specific mouse anti-human antibodies for I hour (or any non-biotinylated<br>
anti-allogeneic antibody specific for the target cell population may be used). The suspension is<br>
again washed three times and diluted to the desired concentration. The resulting suspension can be<br>
refrigerated at 4 degrees Centigrade until use. Alternatively, biotinylated primary antibodies may<br>
be used without the use of secondary antibodies. The beads produced by this technique are<br>
substantially identical.<br>
2) Beads are precoated with anti-Fc receptor antibodies (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN)<br>
such as goat anti-mouse IgG Fc receptor antibodies. These beads can then be suspended in a<br>
solution of antibodies which would spontaneously bind to the anti-Fc receptor sites on the beads.<br>
in the example cited above, mouse anti-human antibodies would be bound to the beads followed by<br>
appropriate washing steps similar to that described above.<br>
3) Binding substances such as any protein, peptide, or nucleotide sequence may be bound by<br>
other chemical or specific binding methods. For example, polystyrene microspheres are "naturally"<br>
left coated with sulfate surface groups after manufacture. These ligands can be used to link<br>
proteins and peptides directly to the surface of the beads. Examples of such functional surface<br>
groups that can be coated on the surface includes, but is not limited to. aldehyde, aliphatic amine,<br>
amide, aromatic amine, carboxylic acid, chloromethyl, epoxy, hydrazide, hydroxyl, sulfooate, and<br>
tosy (toluene sulfonyl) reactive iigands. These can then be used in turn to link peptides, proteins,<br>
oligonucleotides, and other biochemical Iigands to the surface. These Iigands or binding substances<br>
would in turn be used to bind specific sites on cell surfaces which would link the cell to the surface<br>
of the bead. For example, a small molecule such as the hormone 1L-2 could be used by one of the<br>
above methods to coat beads with the intention of binding IL-2 receptor sites (CD25) on cell<br>
surfaces. This could be used to bind cells such as T-cells, monocytes, and neoplastic cells such as<br>
hairy cell leukemia.<br>
Other methods:<br>
Submicroscopic paramagnetic microspheres (preferably less than 1 micron «n diameter) are<br>
bound to any reactive biomarker of interest. The binding that is used could be any of the above<br>
methods. Cells are then permeabilized and fixed using a vanety of detergents and weak fixative<br>
solutions such as 1 % paraformaldehyde. Alternatively a number of commercially available<br>
permeabilizing kits are available for this purpose such as IntraStain (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA).<br>
The reactive biomarker, such as antimyeloperoxidase antibodies, anti-terminal deoxytidyl<br>
transferee antibodies, or specific RNA or DNA probes, is then incubated with the cell suspension.<br>
The biomarkers and paramagnetic particles get inside the cell and. for example, the probe binds to<br>
the intracellular target. The cells are then washed and resuspended in a suitable buffer such as PBS<br>
or RPMI. The suspension is then incubated with magnetic beads or microspheres of a size or color<br>
easily visualized, such as I to 20 or 3-15 or 5-10 or 10-20 microns. The magnetic beads bind to<br>
the cell surface, but cannot cross the membrane, to create a cell-bead complex that is easily trapped<br>
such as via filtration.<br>
In one example, abnormal Masts in a bone marrow suspension can be permeabilized and<br>
incubated with anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies bound to submicroscopic paramagnetic<br>
microspheres. The suspension is then washed three times in buffered salt solution and resuspended<br>
and incubated with large magnetic beads of a preferred size of 5-15 micron diameter to create cells<br>
bound to large beads.<br>
In another example, specific DNA sequences (probes) are bound to submicroscopic<br>
paramagnetic microspheres using methods such as avidinated microspheres and biotinylated probes.<br>
Cells from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia are permeabilized and incubated with<br>
probes binding to the specific bcr-abi translocation Sat is diagnostic for the disease. The<br>
suspension is then washed and incubated with large magnetic beads of a preferred size of 5-15<br>
micron diameter to create cells bound to large beads.<br>
Detection and analysis:<br>
The cell-bead complexes (cells bound to beads) provided or obtained as described above<br>
are then passed through a solid support filter having a porosity of sufficient size to allow unbound<br>
cells and beads to pass through. The suspension is passed through the filter using a variety of<br>
acceptable methods which includes gravity, suction (applied vacuum), positive pressure on the fluid<br>
side, or wicking the fluid through the fitter using a porous absorbabte material such as gauze pads.<br>
Various devices that can be used include pistons, syringes, or suction methods to create a negative<br>
pressure to pass fluid through the filter. In a preferred embodiment, a single solid filter with a<br>
pore size of 10-15 microns is used. Cell-bead complexes remain trapped on the filter and the layer<br>
is then transferred to a glass slide by direct contact with the slide and applying gentle pressure.<br>
The resulting slide preparation can be stained using a variety of commercially available stains such<br>
as bematoxylin and eosin, Papanicolau stain, or any Romanowsky stain. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the cells remain suspended in a compatible buffer such as PBS, RPMI, or<br>
commercially available antibody diluent and the resulting slide is stained with Wright-Giemsa stain.<br>
Alternatively, cells may be suspended in ethanol or a commercially available fixative such as<br>
Cytolyte (Cytyc Corp., Boxborough, MA). The resulting slide is then stained with Papanicolau or<br>
hematoxylin and eosin stains. The complexes are examined and the cells are characterized under<br>
routine light microscopy.<br>
The invention can be used to perform single parameter analysis correlated with<br>
morphology, simultaneous single parameter analysis, or multiparameter analysis. In single<br>
parameter analysis, (depicted in Figs. 1 and 2) a single bead type is added to a suspension of cells<br>
in a liquid medium so that after filtration the slide is provided with an enriched single cell<br>
population. This is useful as a simple screen to determine if a cell population has a particular<br>
characteristic such as distinguishing monocytes from monocytoid B lymphocytes as cited in<br>
Example 1 below. In this configuration, cells bind to beads and are visible on the glass slide for<br>
analysis. Alternatively, a B cell population can be assayed for expression of kappa or lambda by<br>
using two separate slides or slide wells each of which contain a single bead type (anti-kappa or anti-<br>
lambda). Another variant of this analysis is to add simultaneously to the cell suspension two<br>
different bead types, one anti-kappa and a second anti-lambda. This is an example of simultaneous<br>
single parameter analysis since binding of each bead type is independent of the other but the results<br>
are analyzed together. An analogous situation occurs in flow cytometry analysis when fluorescence<br>
is displayed vs. cell number to obtain a single histogram. In kappa and lambda analysis, a<br>
monoclonal population can only be detected by simultaneous analysis of both histograms and<br>
looking for single peaks of fluorescence. Finally, multinarameter analysis can be performed by<br>
linking detection of two different characteristics so that analysis is performed together. In this<br>
case, binding of one set of beads occurs, followed by a second and optionally more sets of beads<br>
(see Figure 3). Analysis looks for simultaneous binding of more than one set of beads to the target<br>
cell population (as depicted in Example 2 below).<br>
The invention can be used to detect abnormal loss of binding when strong binding would<br>
be expected. For example, normal myeloid cells such as mature granulocytes and monocytes in the<br>
peripheral blood would-be expected to strongly express the surface markers CD 13, CD33, CDUb,<br>
and CD 16. In a bone marrow sample there would be a continues range of increasing expression of<br>
these markers as the cell matures. However, cells showing abnormal maturation, as seen in<br>
myelodysplasia, would show diminished expression of these marker;;. This phenomenon has been<br>
previously described by Davis, et al. and can be seen in flow cytometry analysis as abnormal<br>
patterns of expression on appropriate histograms. However, a similar loss of expression is seen<br>
when normal cells die and degenerate as occurs in specimen mishandling or aging. Since<br>
morphologic correlation is less than optimal by flow cytometry, the phenomenon has limited<br>
diagnostic usefulness, particularly when the specimen has been transported long distances. In the<br>
present invention, cells can be visualized on the glass slide to confirm their viability. Normal cells<br>
would strongly bind beads coated with these markers but there would be decreased binding of beads<br>
in cells with myelodyspiasia. In the low grade myelodysplasias such as refractory anemia and<br>
refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, there are often no objective diagnostic criteria for<br>
confirming the diagnosis. Current slate of the art in such cases requires prolonged follow up and<br>
diagnosis by exclusion of other possible entities such as ethanol toxicity or megaloblastic anemia<br>
from vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. The invented method provides a much needed positive<br>
diagnostic test.<br>
A complementary detection method is that prior to transfer of the cells to a glass slide, the<br>
filter is gently rinsed and scanned using a light beam of either a white light beam or a specific<br>
wavelength to correspond to the excitation wavelength of fluorescent beads. The number of events<br>
is counted electronically and the cells are then transferred to a glass slide and stained. The average<br>
number of cells per microsphere is then obtained manually and an estimate of the total number of<br>
target cells in the sample can be estimated (assuming that a known volume of sample is used).<br>
Preferred applications:<br>
1) Single parameter analysis of tumors and other specific cell populations. A suspected tumor<br>
with a known immunophenotype can be analyzed to confirm the presence of a single marker as<br>
outlined in Examples 1 and 3 below. This is most useful in settings where a single issue regarding<br>
cell phenotype needs to be settled. In Example 1 below, knowing that the abnormal ceil population<br>
is of B cell origin is sufficient information to proceed with further studies, since this suggests (but<br>
does not prove) malignancy. In Example 3 below, knowing that the lymphoid population is of T<br>
cell origin suggests that the patient has a reactive infiltrate rather than a malignant infiltrate. If this<br>
assay had been clinically available in both of these unusual cases, the results of the simple study in<br>
Example 1 would justify further expense of additional evaluation. The results of Example 3 justify<br>
not performing flow cytometry and proceeding to treatment for meningitis. Other applications of<br>
these kinds of analysis can be useful in other kinds of tumors such as MN/CA9 screening for<br>
cervical cancer, identifying specific tumor types in malignant infiltrates such as melanoma (using<br>
markers such as HMB-45), or identifying micrometastic disease in lymph nodes and bone marrows.<br>
In addition, single parameter analysis can be used in genetic phenotypic and genotypic analysis.<br>
For example, a peripheral blood sample can be permeabilized and treated with a specific probe to<br>
the bcr-abl translocation. The probe can be labeled with paramagnetic submicroscopic<br>
microspheres. The cells can (hen be treated with large, magnetic beads to identify the presence of<br>
the translocation that would be diagnostic of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Alternatively, a<br>
similar method can be used to identify the presence of intracellular proteins or RNA sequences<br>
using appropriate antibodies or nucleotide sequences, for example, the expression of the<br>
intracellular protein terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) using an antibody also labeled<br>
with paramagnetic microspheres and detecting the reaction using large surface magnetic beads.<br>
Finally, the use of CD64 expression has been proposed as a rapid diagnostic test for clinically<br>
significant acute inflammatory reaction (Lab. Hematol. 1995; 1:3-12). For reasons described<br>
above, flow cytometry is too expensive and difficult to use as a screening procedure for common<br>
conditions. The invented method allows rapid, inexpensive single parameter analysis for CD64<br>
expression in peripheral gramilocytes.<br>
2) Simultaneous single parameter analysis is where there is simultaneous analysis of markers<br>
that are independent of each other. Most commonly, this is used in a B cell lymphoid population to<br>
determine expression of either kappa or lambda light chain restriction by expressed surface<br>
immunoglobuiins. This can either be done by using similar beads as used in two separate glass<br>
slides analyzed simultaneously or by using a single slide using two sets of beads which can be<br>
easily distinguished based on size, color, or both. This is extremely useful as an inexpensive, rapid<br>
screen for B ceil monoclonality. Other useful types of simultaneous single parameter analysis are<br>
in the setting of a malignant tumor of unknown origin where a cell suspension can be analyzed,<br>
either by using multiple separate slides or a single slide containing multiple sets of beads that can<br>
be distinguished by size, color, or both. In this example, these sets of beads typically include<br>
beads marking for CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), HMB-45 (melanoma), and a general<br>
cytokeratin marker (often AE1 and AE3 cocktail for epithelial tumors). A third type of this kind of<br>
analysis is to screen a population of lymphocytes to determine whether this population is composed<br>
of B cells, T ceils, other cells, or any combination of these types.<br>
3) The invention also includes multiparameter analysis where expression of markers are<br>
analyzed in conjunction with other markers. A simple, but common, example of this kind of<br>
analysis is depicted in Example 2 below. In Example 2, the positive binding reaction by the anti-<br>
CD20 coated beads which isolates the B cells is linked to kappa or lambda light chain expression.<br>
Multiparameter analysis enhances analysis since correctly identifying certain cell populations<br>
requires logical association of multiple subsets of markers. A case of acute leukemia serves as a<br>
useful example of this kind of analysis. Morphologic examination is one of the best methods for<br>
identifying the abnormal blast cells, but it does not characterize the kind of blasts present.<br>
Combining morphologic analysis with the present invention would yield the following typical kind<br>
of analysis. Anti-CD34 coated beads are combined with anti-HLA-DR coated beads to confirm<br>
expression of both of these markers in the malignant cell population. Positive expression of both of<br>
these markers supports the diagnosis of acute leukemia. The cells can then be analyzed with anti-<br>
CD13 and anti-CD33 coated beads »n conjunction with anti-CD19 and anti-CD2 coated beads to<br>
determine if the cells are myeloid or lymphoid in origin. If they bind to CD 13, CD33, or both,<br>
this confirms the myeloid derivation of the cells. The cells can also be analyzed with anti-CD15,<br>
anti-CD 14, anti-CD56, anti-CD7, and anti-CD4 to determine subtype (myeloid, monocytic, or both)<br>
and to yield prognostic information. Of particular interest is successful analysis of acute<br>
promyeiocytic leukemia (FAB subtype M3). Analysis of this tumor type by flow cytometry is<br>
fraught wilh errors and the tumor can be missed since it is composed of maturing myeloid cells.<br>
Using the present invention, morphologic analysis would confirm the presence of excess numbers<br>
of promyeiocytic cells. In addition, the promyelocytes would usually be HLA-DR negative and<br>
could also be analyzed for the transiocation of chromosomes 15 and 17 (t(15;17)) which is<br>
diagnostic of the disease. This kind of analysis is particularly useful in the microgranular variant<br>
of the disease in which the cells may resemble monobtasts. Monocytic leukemias can also be<br>
analyzed for additional monocytic markers such as CD36. Similar kinds of analyses can be<br>
performed for other hematologic malignancies, other tumor types, and other specific cell<br>
populations. In addition, the method can be used in reverse to offer a diagnostic test for<br>
myelodysplasia. Normal myeloid cells strongly bind the myeloid markers CD1 lb, CD13, CD16,<br>
and CD33. Among the changes seen in myelodysplasia, is decreased expression of these markers<br>
by flow cytometry. However, degenerating cells, as occurs in excessive sample age, temperature<br>
extremes, or other forms of specimen mishandling also causes decreased expression of these<br>
markers. Since morphologic correlation with flow cytometry is so poor, this form of analysis has<br>
not gained significant clinical acceptable since flow cytometry cannot reliably distinguish between<br>
degenerated normal cells and myelodysplastic cells. In the invented method there is excellent<br>
morphologic correlation, and trained observers will easily recognize degenerated cells. Therefore,<br>
normal cells can easily be distinguished from dysplastic cells, as normal cells will avidly bind beads<br>
coated with antibodies to these markers and dysplastic cells will not.<br>
Another similar application can be used for analysis of breast cancer to determine<br>
prognostic factors such as Her2/neu overexpression. Current state of the art utilizes primarily<br>
immunohistochemistry to localize actual tumor from surrounding breast tissue by visual methods.<br>
Her2/neu cytoplasmic membrane expression is estimated by the observer visually on a scale<br>
expressed as 0+ positive (no expression) to 4 + positive (strongest possible expression). There are<br>
no objective quantitative methods to estimate the level of Her2/neu overexpression. Alternatively.<br>
Her2/neu expression can be more objectively estimated by using fluorescent in-situ hybridization<br>
(FISH) which labels each gene copy wilh a fluorescent dot. The number of gene copies in each<br>
cell can be estimated by merely counting the dots within the nucleus of each cell. However,<br>
because cells cannot be easily counter-stained and observed, it is difficult to tell a malignant breast<br>
epithelial cell from an admixed benign one or even a stromai cell from the breast supporting<br>
matrix. Therefore, analysis by FISH has less acceptance in the clinical setting. More recently,<br>
Her2/neu expression can be performed by flow cytometry, however, like FISH there is no method<br>
for evaluating whether the analyzed cell is a malignant cell or a benign one. Using multiparameter<br>
analysis as described in the present invention, epithelial cells in a cell suspension can be<br>
distinguished from stromai cells by using large (10 micron) beads coated with anti-cytokeratin<br>
antibodies. Only epithelial cells would bind to this bead. Small S micron beads coated with an<br>
appropriate anti-Her2/neu antibody is then added to the mixture and the suspension filtered.<br>
Her2/neu expression can be analyzed objectively by several methods. In one method, the filter<br>
itself can be analyzed to determine the quantity of 5 micron beads present on the filter by using<br>
methods such as fluorescence (if the 5 micron beads are fluorescent), electrostatic assessment, or<br>
other of a variety of known counting methods. In an alternative method, the suspension is<br>
transferred to a glass slide after filtration and the slide stained. Benign cells can be distinguished<br>
from malignant ones by morphologic assessment and the average number of beads binding to<br>
malignant cells can be estimated. This can either be performed manually by the observer or in a<br>
semi-automated manner using an electronic visual analysis to count the number of beads bound to<br>
each cell identified by the observer as malignant.<br>
4) Signal amplification of weakly expressed antigens. One of the major advantages of flow<br>
cytometry is its ability to detect weakly expressed antigens on the surface of cells. Many antigens<br>
fall under this category and cannot be easily detected using alternative means such as routine<br>
inuminostains using standard colon metric detection methods such as diaminobenzadine (DAB).<br>
This problem in immunostains has been partially overcome using signal amplification methods such<br>
as tyramide signal amplification which is commercially available such as the Catalyzed Signal<br>
Amplification kit (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). In the method, the primary antibody is<br>
conjugated to peroxidase enzyme (usually horseradish peroxidase or HRP) and oxygen free radicals<br>
are generated. In the presence of tyramide, the tyramide molecules themselves become free<br>
radicals and are short lived, highly reactive species. They readily conjugate to nearby molecules<br>
and are fixed in the immediate area of the primary antibody. The signal amplification derives from<br>
the ease in which tyramide is conjugate either to a fluorescent molecule or peroxidase. This added<br>
peroxidase is used to generate additional DAB signal and thus the signal is amplified. This signal<br>
amplification technique can also be applied to the invented method described herein. In one<br>
example, primary antibodies are conjugated to HRP to generate biotinylated tryamide free radicals<br>
as per the manufacturer's directions. Avidinated beads then readily and spontaneously bind to the<br>
cell surface at the appropriate sites. An alternative method uses submicroscopic beads that are<br>
invisible by routine light microscopy which are coated with the antibody of interest that also have a<br>
peroxide free radical generator such as HRP bound either to the antibody or to the surface of the<br>
bead. Biotinylated tyramide free radicals are generated as per the manufacturer's directions and<br>
then the cells are washed (or filtered) and treated with avidinated large beads that are easily visible<br>
by light microscopy (typically beads in the 5-20 micron size range). This method of signal<br>
amplification greatly enhances otherwise weak binding of beads when only rare antigens are present<br>
on the cell surface. Single amplification can also be achieved using (1) the dual-labelled Envision<br>
polymer system available from Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA. or (2) the mirror image<br>
complimentary antibodies technique, a kit for which is available from The Binding Site Company,<br>
Birmingham, England.<br>
5) An alternative method of multiparameter analysis can be performed by first using a single<br>
set of beads to isolate the target cell population. The second parameter can then be detected by<br>
using routine or conventional inununohistochemical techniques such as immunflouresence,<br>
colorometric methods such as peroxide reduced DAB or alkaline phosphatase methods, or<br>
immunogold/silver enhancement. This second antibody detection system can be applied either in<br>
the cell suspension or after the slide is made but before it is stained. The choice of method and<br>
detection method would be dependent on the desired stain in the final product and the particular<br>
antibody to be used. Since this method bypasses fixation and processing used in paraffin embedded<br>
tissue sections, antibodies that cannot be used in these paraffin can be used here such as CD 10,<br>
CD2, or CD19.<br>
The following Examples further illustrate various aspects of the invention, including single<br>
parameter and multiparameter analysis.<br>
Example 1<br>
A 30 year old man presented with pancytopenia and splenomegaly. Examination of the<br>
peripheral smear confirmed the pancytopenia. In addition, scattered cells were present that showed<br>
bland cytological characteristics, with a monocytoid appearance. The nuclei of these cells were<br>
round to oval, with a single intermediate nucleolus. There was abundant blue-gray cytoplasm that<br>
showed numerous cytoplasmic projections. A bone marrow examination revealed a hypocellular<br>
aspirate with similar cells present. Small clusters of abnormal cells were present on the core<br>
biopsy. A buffy coat sample of the peripheral smear was suspended in anti-CD20 coated 10-<br>
micron colorless beads to distinguish the abnormal cells from monocytes. The suspension was<br>
passed through an appropriate filter and the ceils were then transferred lo a glass slide and stained.<br>
A schematic of the resulting slide preparation is demonstrated in Figure 2. Positive binding of the<br>
abnormal celt population to the 10-micron beads was a suspicious finding and suggested an<br>
abnormal B cell population. Flow cytometry performed on the bone marrow aspirate revealed a<br>
monoclonal population of monocytoid B cells expressing CD19. CD11c, CD103. and kappa light<br>
chain restriction confirming the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.<br>
Example 2<br>
A 68 year old man with a known history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presented<br>
for routine follow up examination. Clinical examination revealed that the patient had a peripheral<br>
white cell count of 435,500 cells/ml (normal range 4,300-11,000 cells/ml) which included 87%<br>
lymphocytes. Morphologic examination of the peripheral blood smear revealed predominantly an<br>
abnormal population of small lymphocytes with a small but significant population of large<br>
transformed cells. A suspension of cells in a liquid medium was provided. This sample was<br>
analyzed using anti-CD20 coated 10-micron beads, anti-kappa coated colorless 5-micron beads and<br>
anti-lambda coated colorless 5-micron beads in two separate tubes. In the procedure, the same<br>
sample was placed into each of 2 tubes. To each tube was added anti-CD20 coated 10-micron<br>
beads. These strongly bound the B cells. The question then was whether the B ceils were kappa,<br>
lambda or a combination of both. Therefore, the 5 micron anti-kappa beads were added to the first<br>
tube and the 5 micron anti-lambda beads were added to the second tube. The results were then<br>
analyzed after filtering and placing on a glass slide. The cells strongly bound to the 10-micron<br>
beads and showed no binding to the anti-lambda beads and scattered binding to the anti-kappa beads<br>
(ie, like Fig. 3, except only 1-2 small beads per complex). These results are typical of CLL since<br>
this tumor strongly expresses CD20 but weak light chain restriction when analyzed by flow<br>
cytometry. As an alternative procedure, the 5 micron anti-kappa beads could be red and the 5<br>
micron anti-lambda beads could be blue. The procedure could still be in 2 tubes as described<br>
above, or the kappa and lambda beads could be added simultaneously to the first tube. Analysis of<br>
this latter result would show a complex like Fig. 3 with blue only around the periphery (indicating<br>
monoclonal lambda), rod only around the periphery (indicating monoclonal kappa), of a<br>
combination of red and blue around the periphery (indicating polyclonal B cells).<br>
Example 3<br>
A 19 year old man presented with headache and stiff neck to the emergency. His<br>
evaluation included obtaining a sample of cerebral spinal fluid for which emergency pathologist<br>
evaluation of the fluid was requested to rule out the presence of "blasts". Evaluation showed a<br>
relatively uniform population of small lymphocytes, and a diagnosis of viral meningitis was<br>
suggested. The patient's physician requested flow cytomelry to completely rule out the possibility<br>
of malignancy. Since excess fluid was available, a small sample was treated with anti-CD20 coated<br>
10-micron beads and anti-kappa and anti-lambda coated 5-micron beads in two separate tubes using<br>
essentially the same procedure as described in Example 2 above. The majority of cells did not bind<br>
to either the anti-CD20, anti-kappa, or anti-lambda beads, suggesting that the lymphoid population<br>
was composed predominantly of T cells. Flow cytometric analysis received two days later<br>
confirmed approximately 60% T cells and 40% B cells wilb normal T cell subsets and polytypic B<br>
cells consistent with viral meningitis.<br>
A major advantage of the invention is that analysis of cell populations can now be<br>
performed by simple inspection of the glass slide by any physician or technologist. This kind of<br>
analysis can be used on any type of ceil population bearing specific cell surface markers and in a<br>
wide variety of conditions {lymphoma is one example). Malignant clones from patients with acute<br>
leukemia can be similarly analyzed (using different types of markers), as can cell populations from<br>
patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Finally, as tumor markers for solid<br>
neoplasms become available, this kind of analysis can also be performed in a similar fashion. For<br>
example, the new MN/CA9 antibody appears to be specifically expressed by dyspiastic and<br>
malignant uterine cervical squamous cells. Since these cells may be suspended in a sea of normal<br>
ceils, they may be difficult to identify even by routine inununohistochemistry. This method of<br>
analysis may both identify these cells and enrich a cytological preparation for them so that they can<br>
be more easily analyzed.<br>
The present invention also provides a kit for practicing the invention. The kit contains one<br>
or more sets of beads as described above. Each set of beads is preferably in a container such as a<br>
sealed test tube. In some cases of simultaneous single parameter or multiparameter analysis, two<br>
or more sets of beads can be premised, but typically they are kept separated. The kit also<br>
preferably contains one or more appropriate filters as described above and preferably a set of<br>
instructions.<br>
The methodology described herein can be automated and condensed. An example of a<br>
semiautomated device 25 for the performance of this kind of analysis is depicted in Figure 4. A<br>
sample is prepared to make a cell suspension. The sample is then loaded into the machine 25 in<br>
the sample loader 26 and the machine 25 is programmed for the kind of analysis desired<br>
(lymphoma screen, acute leukemia analysis, myelodysplasia, etc.). The sample is divided into the<br>
appropriate number of reaction chambers 28 (for example, 2, 4, 6, 8. 10 or 12) and a<br>
preprogrammed number of bead sets (for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc bead sets) added sequentially or<br>
simultaneously to each reaction chamber. The beads are incubated in the cell suspension and<br>
allowed to bind to the cells and all reaction chamber samples are then transferred to a filtration<br>
chamber 30 where each reaction chamber sample is filtered. The resulting filters or filtered<br>
materials are arranged so that all of them are simultaneously transferred to a single glass slide such<br>
as glass slide 32. The resulting slide contains a series of wells, each well corresponding to a<br>
reaction chamber sample. The multi-well slide can be stained, then scanned under a microscope.<br>
Each well can correspond to a mulliparameter analysis, which is performed in minutes. Figure 5 is<br>
a schematic for a suggested lymphoma panel slide using such a procedure. Fig. 5 shows 6 wells,<br>
each having run a 3-bead set as shown for multiparameter analysis. In the upper left hand comer<br>
is "CD20/kappa/lambda". This indicates a well where the machine ran the CD20/kappa/lambda<br>
analysis described earlier herein. The other 5 wells give antibody information for running similar<br>
analyses as known in the art. Optionally a fourth or fifth set of beads can be added for further<br>
levels of analysis. Preferably after the single parameter or multiparameter incubation and filtration<br>
is carried out, the resulting complexes (such as in Fig. 3) are stained by immunohistochemistry or<br>
in-situ hybridization and then evaluated. Coated glass slides are preferred, to increase<br>
adhesiveness. Preferably, the slides are stained, coverslipped and examined by routine light<br>
microscopy to assess binding. Cells bound to beads are preferably assessed to characterize and<br>
ensure cell type.<br>
In the present invention ceils in suspension in fixative or tissue media can be phenotyped<br>
by antibody coaled beads and isolated from the surrounding milieu by the use of a filter of proper<br>
pore size. These bound cells, thus separated from the sea of other cells, can be transferred to a<br>
glass slide and stained with a variety of stains for visualization. In addition, if imrounopbenotyping<br>
is not desired, a routine cytologic preparation using a variety of methods such as cytospin, cell<br>
block, or ThinPrep can be prepared.<br>
Single parameter analysis can be used to phenotype cells of interest, such as enumerating<br>
relative numbers of kappa and lambda-bearing B lymphocytes. Another application is the isolation<br>
of MN/CA9 positive cervical epithelial cells.<br>
Certain cell surface markers can be semi-quantitated by first isolating cells of interest and<br>
then enumerating the average number of beads bound to the surface.<br>
