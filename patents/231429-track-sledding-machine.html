				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to equipment for the maintenance of a railway. More<br>
particularly, the invention concerns machinery for removing ballast from a railway.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Railways generally consist of a track supported by a bed of crushed rock or<br>
gravel, this bed being referred to as "ballast" in the art. Most tracks comprise a pair<br>
ties"). Sleepers are formed from steel, timber or concrete.<br>
There is a need as part of normal railway maintenance for the removal of track ballast.<br>
This is usually brought about by the ballast becoming fouled with soil or the like, or<br>
through there being excessive ballast present as a result of past maintenance. Ballast<br>
fouling prevents escape of water that can inundate the railway during heavy rain or<br>
flooding, while excessive ballast can lead to instability of the railway.<br>
Ballast removal requires lifting of the track so that the ballast between and<br>
underneath the sleepers can be accessed. Normally, ballast removal is necessary over<br>
many kilometers of railway. The process must therefore be done mechanically as<br>
manual removal would be too inefficient due to the amount of labour that would be<br>
required to rapidly carry out the process to minimize track closure time.<br>
Apparatus for removal of ballast is known in the art. One such apparatus is a<br>
sled consisting of a plough that is V-shaped in plan and is mounted into a frame over<br>
which the track is passed as the sled is drawn therebeneath. Skids are included in the<br>
frame to allow passage of the track over the sled which sled is pulled by steel cables<br>
connected between the sled frame and a locomotive. Ballast removal using this<br>
apparatus is referred to a "track sledding".<br>
There are a number of disadvantages in using the sled described in the<br>
preceding paragraph for ballast removal. First, the cables by which the sled is pulled can<br>
break creating a potentially serious safety hazard. Second, track components particularly<br>
sleepers, can be damaged as the track slides over the sled. Third, there is insufficient<br>
control over the sled during the sledding operation. Consequently, the remaining ballast<br>
bed may have a poor surface and the resulting<br><br>
track alignment poor necessitating substantial additional resurfacing.<br>
Other apparatus for removal of ballast utilizes endless chains to cut the<br>
ballast out from the track. Apparatus of this type leaves the track with good<br>
alignment and surface. However, the apparatus has a high capital cost of<br>
manufacture and is slow yet expensive to operate. Such apparatus is known in<br>
the art as ballast undercutting machinery.<br>
A ballast leveling machine is described in US Patent No. 4,064,807. This<br>
machine has a central plough blade and blades either side thereof. The function<br>
eof the central blade is to evacuate ballast from between the rails while the side<br>
blades—which have higher bottom edges have the central blade—distribute and<br>
level the ballast to provide a bed for the track beneath the rails. The machine<br>
does not, therefore, remove ballast from beneath the track as a whole.<br>
Because of the disadvantages of ballast undercutting machinery, track<br>
sledding apparatus is the apparatus of choice for ballast removal. There is<br>
nevertheless a need for tracking sledding apparatus that overcomes the<br>
disadvantages of the apparatus described above. Specifically, there is a need for<br>
a track sledding machine that meets the following requirements:<br>
1. the plough or any equivalent component is sufficiently controlled so that<br>
the surface of the remaining ballast or formation after the sledding<br>
operation is close to the original surface or to a desired surface with<br>
respect to top and cant without the need for substantial resurfacing<br><br>
thereby providing a railway that is suitable for the immediate passage of<br>
trains;<br>
2.	the track alignment can be sufficiently controlled during ballast removal to<br>
minimize resurfacing alignment corrections so that the railway is again<br>
suitable for the immediate passage of trains;<br>
3.	damage to track is eliminated or at least minimized; and<br>
4.	it can be moved at a speed that permits efficient removal of ballast without<br>
compromising operator safety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a track sledding machine that meets the<br>
requirements set out above.<br>
In a broad format, the invention provides improved track sledding machine<br>
comprising:<br>
a railway wagon having adjustably carried therebeneath a plough comprising at<br>
least on plough blade; and<br>
rail clamps for suspending said track above said plough to allow ploughing of<br>
ballast with movement of said wagon.<br>
The principle of the track sledding machine described in the previous	<br><br>
paragraph is that a plough is part of a machine of sufficient mass to provide for<br>
control of the plough during ballast removal. This results in a consistency of the<br>
surface of the remaining ballast bed or formation. Furthermore, the use of rail<br>
clamps to support the track clear of the plough as the plough passes thereunder<br>
reduces to essentially nil the instances of damage to track components. As the<br>
machine in its preferred embodiment is designed to be direct coupled to a standard<br>
locomotive, the major safety risk of at least the sledding apparatus described above<br>
is eliminated.<br>
To effect efficient operation of the plough in giving a ballast bed or formation<br>
surface that has close to the desired surface, the machine typically has a minimum<br>
weight of 60 or 70 tonnes depending on allowable axle loads for the track on which<br>
it is to operate. This ensures that the plough is held at a constant level by the mass<br>
of the machine and is not displaced when a more firmly packed region of ballast or<br>
an obstacle within the ballast is encountered. The use of rail clamps for elevating<br>
the track further enhances the stability of the machine in operation—up to 30 tonne<br>
lift can be applied to the track in some circumstances.<br>
The wagon, or machine main frame, of the track sledding machine of the<br>
invention can be of any configuration. Advantageously, the wagon comprises a<br>
horizontal frame to which bogies including brakes are mounted at each end thereof<br>
and has vertically extending framework to which machine components and<br>
equipment of operating components can be attached.<br>
The multibladed plough typically comprises a plurality of blades that are V-<br>
shaped in plan. The machine proceeds with the points of vees foremost during<br>
ploughing so that ballast is largely displaced to the sides of the track for subsequent<br>
removal if necessary. In instances where displacement of ballast to only one side<br>
of the track is desired, the plough can be configured to include a plurality of blades<br>
that are straight in plan but are angled across the machine. Displacement is then to<br>
the side of the machine at the trailing ends of the blades. Ploughs can also<br>
comprise a combination of V-shaped and straight blades to achieve the same end<br>
result of displacement of ballast to one side of the railway. Ploughs can be<br>
configured so that the angle of blades can be varied. The angle of the "V" typically<br>
ranges between 60 to 120°. Straight blades can advantageously be varied through<br><br>
a range of 10 to 60° to the plough centre-line.<br>
Ploughs can have from one to twenty blades but typically have from four to<br>
eight blades. With a plough comprising V-shaped in plan blades, a minimum of four<br>
blades is preferred although six blades are also efficacious with straight blades.<br>
The plough blades typically have a width of 100 to 300 mm. This allows<br>
cutting to a minimum of about 100 mm with there being sufficient headroom<br>
between the chassis of the wagon and the elevated plough, and for the track to be<br>
lifted within rail stress considerations.<br>
Machines according to the invention can include blades for pre-cutting<br>
ballast. These blades are mounted, typically as pairs, ahead of the plough with the<br>
blades comprising a pair on opposite sides of the machine. In a machine based on<br>
a wagon of 20 rn, there is sufficient space ahead of a centrally positioned plough for<br>
from one to six pre-cutter blades or blade pairs although machines can have from<br>
one to ten or more pre-cutter blades or blade pairs. The pre-cutter blades serve to<br>
remove ballast from the edges of the ballast bed to under the ends of the sleepers.<br>
Where more than one pair of pre-cutter blades is fitted, the blades are configured<br>
so that a following blade undercuts a sleeper more than the preceding blade. In<br>
such a configuration, the first pre-cutter blade removes the shoulder ballast close to<br>
the final desired depth of cut and an initial portion of ballast from under and<br>
between the sleeper ends. Lifting of the track above the pre-cutter blades is not<br>
required for ballast removal with the pre-cutter blades as the track is still supported<br>
by the ballast that is as yet uncut. The pre-cutter blades thus serve to reduce the<br>
amount of ballast that has to be removed by the plough thereby allowing a greater<br>
depth of cut with the plough.<br>
In circumstances where the upper layer of ballast is unfouled, the plough can<br>
be set to return some of the upper layer to beneath the track by flow over the upper<br>
edges of the plough blades. That is, all ballast is not necessarily displaced to the<br>
side or sides of the track.<br>
In some instances it is desirable to selectively remove ballast from the upper,<br>
lower or middle section of the ballast bed. To achieve this end, the space between<br>
the blades can be covered with sheet material, typically level with the top of the<br>
blades, so that ballast cannot enter the plough from above. Under this condition,<br><br>
the upper ballast will slide over the top of the plough and be returned to the track<br>
whilst the ballast stratum in front of the plough or presented to each individual blade<br>
is removed when the plough blades are drawn therethrough. Using such a<br>
covered, or "sheeted in", plough, the lower stratum of the ballast bed, for example,<br>
can be selectively removed. When pre-cutter blades are included in a machine,<br>
any spaces therebetween are also advantageously covered at otherwise they may<br>
remove the stratum of ballast that is above the plough blades.<br>
As an alternative to the full covering of the plough with sheet material as<br>
described in the previous paragraph, the covering can be a mesh or grating which<br>
has apertures of a sufficient size to allow unwanted smaller rock and fines to enter<br>
the plough and be discharged whilst the larger reusable ballast particles are passed<br>
over the plough and returned to the track. In other embodiments of the invention,<br>
the plough can have spaces between blades alternately covered with sheeting and<br>
grating material.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the leading blade of a covered plough can be<br>
replaced with a ramp which can lift essentially all of the ballast over the plough.<br>
The plough of machines according to the invention can have associated<br>
therewith a vibrator to enhance ballast flow over the plough and separation of<br>
ballast.<br>
The plough comprises a frame or at least two interconnected rails to which<br>
the blades are fixed. Blades typically have a concave leading face and are<br>
fabricated from hardened steel. Ploughs can also include longitudinally-extending<br>
skids on the upper edges of blades or on the plough frame to minimise damage to<br>
track in the event of a rail clamp failure or in the event of a sleeper falling from the<br>
track.<br>
The adjustable carriage of the plough beneath the wagon is typically via<br>
arms of variable length fixed to at least the rear comers of the plough with the<br>
upper ends of these arms fixed to the wagon framework. The machine also can<br>
include at least one drawbar extending from the wagon to the leading edge of the<br>
plough. The plough is preferably attached to the arms and any drawbar by shear<br>
pins designed to allow disengaging of the plough in the event of severe overload<br>
such as encountering an obstruction in the ballast. Furthermore, the plough can<br><br>
include an offset ripper or scarifier tyne forward of the first plough blade to feed any<br>
buried obstruction, such as a sleeper, to a side of the centreline of the machine and<br>
out of the way of the plough during ballast removal.<br>
As the arms connected to at least the rear corners of the plough are of<br>
variable lengths the longitudinal and lateral tilt of the plough can be adjusted.<br>
Longitudinal tilting of the plough allows the depth of cut to be varied. Typically, the<br>
depth of cut is varied from of the order of 100 mm below the bottom of the sleepers<br>
(when in situ on the ballast) to up to about 400 mm below the bottom of the<br>
sleepers. This allows for merely the reduction of the amount of ballast in the<br>
railway or essentially the entire removal of the ballast. The latter would apply in the<br>
instance of fouled ballast and removal would be followed by replacement with fresh<br>
ballast. When longitudinally tilted, the highest blade is usually at the leading edge<br>
of the plough.<br>
Lateral tilting of the plough allows the cant of the remaining ballast bed or<br>
formation to be adjusted. Such tilting of the plough can be by up to any angle with<br>
respect to the horizontal allowed by normal machine and track geometry. To aid<br>
cant control, the suspension of the wagon lead bogie is locked out. This enables<br>
the machine frame (including plough and rail clamps) to follow closely the cant at<br>
the lead bogie thus minimising control inputs when curves and the like are<br>
encountered.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the maximum depth of<br>
cut of the plough is limited the plough capacity and by allowable rail stress during<br>
the ballast removal operation and the machine wheelbase. The maximum of 400<br>
mm given above is achievable with a wagon having a 17 m wheelbase based on<br>
rail stress considerations. However, a greater maximum cut is achievable using a<br>
wagon with a wheelbase of greater than 17 m.<br>
The rail damps used for suspending the track above the plough can be any<br>
rail clamp known to those of skill in the art. Typically, one pair of clamps are<br>
employed; although two pairs of clamps are advantageous on longer wheelbases,<br>
one pair leading the plough and one pair trailing the plough with the clamps of a<br>
pair acting on opposite rails. Clamps advantageously include a mechanism that<br>
allows overriding of obstacles such as fishplates and weld flashing at rail junctions.<br><br>
A preferred rail clamp is the roller rail clamp described in the applicant's copending<br>
application entitled "Roller Rail Clamp".<br>
Continuously variable machine components, such as the variable length<br>
arms associated with the plough, can be powered in any suitable way. A preferred<br>
power is hydraulic power and to facilitate this a hydraulic pump can be included in<br>
the machine with an appropriate hydraulic circuit. The machine typically also<br>
includes controls at an operator station for adjusting machine components.<br>
For maximum flexibility of the machine, the wagon is advantageously<br>
configured so that it can be operated in either direction. To do this, however,<br>
duplicate plough mountings must be provided so that the plough can be reversed<br>
for operation in the opposite direction to that in which the machine was previously<br>
operated.<br>
Prior to a ballast removal operation, the plough is disconnected from the<br>
machine and installed under the track at the beginning of the section of railway<br>
where ballast is to be removed. Installation of the plough of course requires lifting<br>
of the track with a crane or any other suitable equipment. It will be appreciated that<br>
some excavation of ballast may be required to position the plough under the track.<br>
The machine is then brought along the track over the plough and the plough and<br>
rail clamps connected thereto. The ballast removal operation can then be initiated.<br>
As an alternative to a crane or other equipment, the rail clamps of the sledding<br>
machine can be used for lifting the track for plough installation. This eliminates a<br>
need for additional equipment.<br>
Following ballast removal, the plough is removed by a reversal of the<br>
installation procedure. If it is necessary to free the track for normal railway traffic<br>
prior to completion of ballast removal from the subject section of railway, the plough<br>
can be disconnected from the wagon and left in track for passage of such traffic<br>
thereover with appropriate reduction of speed.<br>
There can be many other variations in the track sledding machine of the<br>
invention. Machines can have more than one plough per wagon. That is, the<br>
machine components set out above can be duplicated on a wagon to provide<br>
tandem ploughs. Multiple ploughs can in fact be installed beneath a single wagon.<br>
Alternatively, multiple machines comprising a single plough per wagon can be used<br><br>
in a series operation. The multiple ploughs associated with one wagon or with a series of wagons<br>
do not necessarily have to be identical. The multiple ploughs can be any combination of open<br>
ploughs and the covered ploughs described above.<br>
To allow fitting of additional ploughs to a wagon, the wagon can have an extendible main<br>
frame and/or a variable wheelbase.<br>
As indicated above, in a preferred embodiment, the machine is designed to be coupled to<br>
a standard locomotive by which it can be pushed or pulled. However, the wagon comprising the<br>
machine can be self-propelled with an appropriate engine and drive train fitted thereto.<br>
A sledding operation using a machine according to the invention can be in combination<br>
with activities such as ballast pick-up, cleaning and return. Other applications of the machine will<br>
be readily recognizable to one of skill in the art of track maintenance.<br>
Having broadly described the invention, a machine will now be exemplified with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings which will now be briefly described.<br>

In the figures, the same item number is used for a feature included in more than one<br>
drawing. A particular drawing is not necessarily to the same scale as other drawings.<br>
BEST MODE AND OTHER MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In Figures 1 and 2 there is shown track sledding machine 1 comprising a wagon 2,<br>
plough assembly 3 and a rail clamp assembly 4. The figures are partially schematic and<br>
components have been omitted that are not necessary to an understanding of how the machine<br>
functions.<br>
Wagon 2 includes a horizontal frame 5 and a truss frame 6 thereon. It has a length of 20<br>
m. The wagon rolls on bogies 7 and 8, and has standard buffers and<br><br>
couplings at each end thereof. The wagon further includes an engine module 9 for<br>
powering a hydraulic system (not shown in the figures) used for operating machine<br>
components, and a control console 10.<br>
Plough assembly 3 is held below wagon 2 by carrier arms, one at each<br>
corner of the assembly. The arms proximal the viewer in Figure 1 are items 11 and<br>
12. Each carrier arm comprises an hydraulic ram and a vernier pin adjustable slide.<br>
Alternatively, a carrier arm can comprise an hydraulic ram alone. Machine 1 also<br>
includes two drawbars, 13 and 14, extending from ends of a lateral member 15<br>
fixed to horizontal frame 5 of wagon 2 to the plough assembly (3). The plough<br>
assembly will be described in greater detail below.<br>
Rail clamp assembly 4 comprises a pair of clamps for each rail, one pair<br>
being indicated as items 16 and 17, which pairs of clamps are pivotally linked to<br>
wagon frame 5 by an arm and sub-assembly 18 (see Figure 1). A pair of hydraulic<br>
rams effects the lifting of track 19, one for each rail, coupled between wagon frame<br>
6 and sub-assembly 18. The ram closest the viewer in Figure 1 is item 20.<br>
The plough assembly 3 is shown in greater detail in Figures 3 and 4. As can<br>
be seen from Figure 3, plough assembly 3 comprises a number of blades, one of<br>
which is indicated at 21. The blades can be seen to be V-shaped in plan and<br>
consist of two sub-blades 22 and 23. The assembly Includes pre-blades. The pre-<br>
blades on one side of the plough are items 24 and 25.<br>
Plough assembly 3 is held together by side arms 26 and 27, and a centre<br>
spine 28. A transverse brace 29 links the side arms and centre spine. Leading<br>
blade 21 includes braces 30 and 31 extending from near the extremities of the sub-<br>
blades to centre spine 28. Plates are provided with holes therethrough for<br>
attachment of the drawbars and carrier arms. For example, plates 32 and 33 at<br>
leading end of side arm 26 provide a point of attachment for drawbar 13 (see<br>
Figures 1 and 2). Plough assembly 3 is attached to the drawbars and carrier arms<br>
using shear pins.<br>
Figure 5 is an end view of a blade which is in itself an assembly comprising a<br>
curved blade 34 perse fixed via a plurality of webs, one of which is item 35, to an<br>
elongate box section member 36. Web 35 and box section member 36 are also<br>
indicated in Figure 3.<br><br>
The track sledding machine exemplified above is suited for operation on<br>
track having rail sizes in the range of 41 to 60 kg/m. The use of the machine on<br>
such track for the reduction of ballast is illustrated in Figure 1. After installation of<br>
plough assembly 3 under track 19, wagon 2 is positioned thereover and the<br>
drawbars (13 and 14) and carrier arms (11 and 12) connected to the plough. The<br>
tilt of the plough is adjusted as required for the desired depth and cant—it can be<br>
seen in the figure that the trailing end of the plough (movement of machine 1 is to<br>
the left as viewed in Figure 1) is lower than the leading edge. It can also be<br>
appreciated from Figure 1 that rail clamp assembly 4 holds the track between the<br>
wagon bogies clear of the plough.<br>
Movement of the machine results in the plough displacing ballast to the sides<br>
of plough assembly 3—see arrows in the plan view of Figure 2. As a consequence,<br>
the track is lowered due to the reduction of the amount of ballast: compare the<br>
level of the track to the left of plough assembly 3 in Figure 1 to the level of the track<br>
to the right of the plough. If desired, the plough can be set so as to pass the top<br>
layer of clean ballast over the tops of the plough blades to be deposited beyond the<br>
plough under the trailing section 37 of track 19. This serves to economise on the<br>
ballast required for reinstatement of the track.<br>
Machine 1, which has a total operational weight of 60 to 70 tonne, is towed<br>
by a 90 or 120 tonne locomotive. Tandem locomotives can also be used. With<br>
such locomotives, the sledding operation can be performed at 5 to 20 km per hour<br>
depending on the condition of the track, with 5 to 10 km/hr being a typical speed. It<br>
will be appreciated from Figure 1 that the length of the wagon allows suspension of<br>
the track above the plough yet the weight of the machine as a whole gives full<br>
control over the plough so that ballast is efficiently removed. Furthermore, the<br>
machine geometry allows track to be lowered to within about 30 mm of the original<br>
track centreline. Additionally the rail clamp assembly can be manually or<br>
automatically controlled to effect track offset with respect to an initial datum.<br>
It will be appreciated that many changes can be made to the track sledding<br>
machine and use thereof as exemplified above without departing from the broad<br>
ambit and scope of the invention<br>
The term "comprise", or variants thereof such as "comprising" or<br><br>
"comprised", is used herein to denote the inclusion of a stated integer or integers,<br>
unless is the context of usage an exclusive interpretation of the term is required.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
