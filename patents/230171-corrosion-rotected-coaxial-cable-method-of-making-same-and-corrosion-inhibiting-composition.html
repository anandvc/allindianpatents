				<td>CORROSION-PROTECTED COAXIAL CABLE,<br>
METHOD OF MAKING SAME AND<br>
CORROSION-INHIBITING COMPOSITION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a coaxial cable and more particularly, to<br>
corrosion-protected trunk and distribution cable and drop cable for the<br>
transmission of RF signals. This application is being divided out of Indian Patent<br>
application No.IN/PCT/2002/01282.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
RF signals such as cable television signals, cellular telephone<br>
signals, and even internet and other data signals, are often transmitted through<br>
coaxial cable to a subscriber. In particular, the RF signals are typically transmitted<br>
over long distances using trunk and distribution cable and drop cables are used as<br>
the final link in bringing the signals from the trunk and distribution cable to the<br>
subscriber. Trunk and distribution cable and drop cable both generally include a<br>
center conductor, a dielectric layer, an outer conductor and often a protective<br>
jacket to prevent moisture from entering the cable.<br>
One problem associated With these coaxial cables is that moisture<br>
present in the cable can corrode the conductors thus negatively affecting the<br>
electrical and mechanical properties of the cable. In particular, during installation<br>
of the cable, moisture can enter the cable at the connectors. This moisture can also<br>
travel within the cable through the dielectric layer or along interfaces in the cable,<br>
e.g., between the dielectric layer and the outer conductor.<br>
Several methods have been proposed to prevent moisture from<br>
entering the cable and being transported through the cable. For example,<br>
hydrophobic, adhesive compositions have been applied at interfaces in the cable to<br><br>
prevent moisture from moving along these interfaces. Flooding or water-blocking<br>
compositions have also been used at other locations in the cable to limit water<br>
transport in the cable. In addition, hydrophilic, moisture-absorbent materials have<br>
been used in cables to act as water-blocking materials. These hydrophilic materials<br>
not only water-block the cable but also remove moisture that is present in the<br>
cable.<br>
Although these materials can provide adequate protection from<br>
moisture and can limit corrosion of the conductors in the cable, these materials<br>
have a tacky or greasy feel and thus are undesirable during the installation and<br>
connectorization of the cable, particularly when located on the outer conductor of<br>
the cable. As a result, these materials generally must be removed or otherwise<br>
addressed during installation and connectorization of the cable. Therefore, there is<br>
a need to provide a corrosion-inhibiting coating for cable that does not possess a<br>
tacky or greasy feel and thus that does not interfere with installation and<br>
connectorization of the cable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a corrosion-protected cable that<br>
includes a corrosion-inhibiting coating that limits and even prevents the corrosion<br>
of the conductors, and particularly the outer conductor, of the cable. In addition,<br>
the present invention includes a corrosion-inhibiting composition and a method of<br>
applying the corrosion-inhibiting composition to the outer conductor of a cable.<br>
The corrosion-inhibiting composition when heated forms a corrosion-inhibiting<br>
coating on the surface of the outer conductor that is not tacky or greasy and thus is<br>
desirable in the art.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the present<br>
invention includes a coaxial cable, comprising an elongate center conductor, a<br>
dielectric layer surrounding the center conductor, an outer conductor surrounding<br>
the dielectric layer, a corrosion-inhibiting coating on at least an outer portion of the<br>
outer conductor, and preferably a polymer jacket around the outer conductor. The<br>
center conductor is preferably formed of a material selected from the group<br>
consisting of copper, a copper alloy, a copper-clad metal, and a copper alloy-clad<br><br>
metal. The dielectric layer preferably comprises a foamed polymeric material.<br>
The cable can further include a corrosion-inhibiting layer between the center<br>
conductor and the dielectric layer comprising a benzotriazole compound (e.g.<br>
BTA) and a polymeric compound (e.g. a foamed, low-density polyethylene). The<br>
outer conductor is preferably formed of aluminum or an aluminum alloy but can be<br>
copper or another conductive material. For example, the outer conductor can<br>
include a bonded aluminum-polymer-aluminum laminate tape extending<br>
longitudinally of the cable preferably having overlapping longitudinal edges and<br>
the corrosion-inhibiting composition can be applied to an outer surface of said<br>
laminate tape. The outer conductor can further include a plurality of braided or<br>
helically arranged wires coated with the corrosion-inhibiting composition.<br>
Alternatively, the outer conductor can include a longitudinally-welded sheath and<br>
the corrosion-inhibiting composition can be applied to an outer surface of the<br>
sheath. The corrosion-inhibiting coating comprises a corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compound selected from the group consisting of petroleum sulfonates,<br>
benzotriazoles, alkylbenzotriazoles, benzimidazoles, guanadino benzimidazoles,<br>
phenyl benzimidazoles, tolyltriazoles, metcaptotriazoles, mercaptobenzotriazoles,<br>
and salts thereof. In addition, the corrosion-inhibiting coating can include a<br>
residual amount of an oil dispersant and/or a residual amount of a stabilizer.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition includes a water-insoluble corrosion-inhibiting compound dispersed<br>
in an oil, and a stabilizer selected from the group consisting of propylene based<br>
glycol ethers, propylene based glycol ether acetates, ethylene based glycol ethers<br>
and ethylene based glycol ether acetates. The stabilizer is preferably selected from<br>
the group consisting of dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate, propylene glycol<br>
methyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether,<br>
propylene glycol t-butyl ether, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, ethylene<br>
glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, ethylene glycol butyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol methyl ether, diethylene glycol ethyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
butyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol butyl ether acetate,<br>
diethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol butyl ether acetate, and<br>
mixtures thereof, and is more preferably a dipropylene glycol ether acetate (e.g.<br><br>
dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate). The corrosion-inhibiting compound is<br>
selected from the group consisting of petroleum sulfonates, benzotriazoles,<br>
alkylbenzotriazoles, benzimidazoles, guanadino benzimidazoles, phenyl<br>
benzimidazoles, tolyltriazoles, metcaptotriazoles, mercaptobenzotriazoles, and<br>
salts thereof, and is preferably a petroleum sulfonate salt. The petroleum sulfonate<br>
salt is selected from the group consisting of calcium, barium, magnesium, sodium,<br>
potassium and ammonium salts, and mixtures thereof, and is preferably a calcium<br>
salt having an activity of greater than 0 to about 25% based on the calcium salt.<br>
The calcium salt optionally further includes a salt selected from the group<br>
consisting of barium and sodium salts. The oil is preferably a paraffinic oil such as<br>
a mineral oil that preferably has a molecular weight of less than about 600. The<br>
-corrosion-inhibiting composition preferably includes the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compound in an amount of from about 5 to about 40% by weight, the oil in an<br>
amount of from about 50 to about 90% by weight, and the stabilizer in an amount<br>
of from about 1 to about 10% by weight. More preferably, the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition includes the corrosion-inhibiting compound in an amount of from<br>
about 15 to about 30% by weight, the oil in an amount of from about 60 to about<br>
80% by weight, and the stabilizer in an amount of from about 3 to about 8% by<br>
weight. The corrosion -inhibiting composition preferably also has a viscosity of<br>
from about 50 to about 450 SSU at 100°F. The corrosion-inhibiting composition<br>
can be heated to form the corrosion-inhibiting coating of the invention that is<br>
present on at least a portion of the outer surface of the outer conductor.<br>
The present invention further includes a method of making a coaxial<br>
cable, comprising the steps of advancing a center conductor along a predetermined<br>
path of travel, applying a dielectric layer around the center conductor, applying an<br>
outer conductor around the dielectric layer, and applying the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition to the outer conductor. The cable can then be heated to produce the<br>
corrosion-inhibiting coating, e.g., by applying a polymer melt around the outer<br>
conductor to form a protective jacket. The outer conductor can be formed by<br>
directing an aluminum-polymer-aluminum laminate tape around the dielectric<br>
layer and overlapping longitudinal edges of the laminate tape to form the outer<br>
conductor. The outer conductor can also include a plurality of wires formed into a<br><br>
braid or helically arranged around the laminate tape and the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition applied to the wires by wiping the wires with the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition. The corrosion-inhibiting composition can also be applied to the outer<br>
conductor by wiping the outer surface of the laminate tape with the corrosion-<br>
inhibiting composition or immersing the cable in the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition prior to forming the braid or helically arranging the wires.<br>
Alternatively, the corrosion-inhibiting composition can be applied to the outer<br>
conductor by wiping the outer surface of the outer conductor with the corrosion-<br>
inhibiting composition or immersing the cable in the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition after forming the braid or helically arranging the wires. The outer<br>
conductor can also be formed by directing an ahuriinum strip around the dielectric<br>
layer and longitudinally-welding abutting edges of the metal strip, and the<br>
corrosion-inhibiting composition applied to the outer conductor by wiping the<br>
outer surface of the outer conductor with the corrosion-inhibiting composition or<br>
by immersing the cable in the corrosion-inhibiting composition.<br>

numbers refer to like elements throughout As used herein, the terms "copper" and<br>
"aluminum" include not only the pure metals but also alloy compositions that<br>
primarily include these metals.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a corrosion-protected coaxial cable 10 according<br>
to one embodiment of the invention. The cable 10 is of the type typically used as<br>
drop cable providing a link for the transmission of RF signals such as cable<br>
television signals, cellular telephone signals, internet, data and the like, fiom a<br>
trunk and distribution cable to a subscriber. In particular, the cable 10 is of the<br>
type that preferably; has a diameter about 0.24 and 0.41 inches.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, the coaxial cable 10 includes an elongate<br>
center conductor 14 of a suitable electrically conductive material and a surrounding<br>
dielectric layer 16. As mentioned above, the center conductor 14 of the cable 10 of<br>
the invention is generally used in the transmission of RF signals. Preferably, the<br>
center conductor 14 is formed of copper, copper-clad steel wire, or copper-clad<br>
aluminum wire but other conductive wires can also be used. The center conductor<br>
is also preferably 20 AWG Wire having a nominal diameter of about 0.032 inches<br>
(0.81 mm).<br>
The dielectric layer 16 can be formed of either a foamed or a solid<br>
dielectric material. Preferably, the dielectric layer 16 is a low loss dielectric<br><br>
formed of a polymeric material that is suitable for reducing attenuation and<br>
maximizing signal propagation such as polyethylene, polypropylene or<br>
polystyrene. Preferably, the dielectric layer is an expanded cellular foam<br>
composition such as a foamed polyethylene, e.g., a foamed high-density<br>
polyethylene. A solid (unfoamed) polyethylene layer can also be used in place of<br>
the foamed polyethylene or can be applied around the foamed polyethylene. The<br>
dielectric layer 16 is preferably continuous from the center conductor 14 to the<br>
adjacent overlying layer.<br>
In addition to the dielectric layer 16, the cable 10 can include a thin<br>
polymeric layer 18. Preferably, the thin polymeric layer 18 is a corrosion-<br>
inhibiting layer comprising a polymeric material and a corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compound. In the preferred embodiment of the invention wherein the center<br>
conductor 14 is copper wire or a copper-clad wire, the polymeric layer 18 is<br>
preferably low density polyethylene in combination with a small amount of a<br>
benzotriazole compound such as benzotriazole (BTA), benzotriazole salts (e.g.<br>
ammonium benzotriazole), mercaptobenzotriazoles, alkylbenzotriazoles, and the<br>
like. Preferably, the polymeric layer includes from about 0.1 to about 1.0% by<br>
weight of BTA. BTA can be purchased, for example, from PMC Specialties under<br>
the name COBRATEC® 99. Alternatively, the polymeric layer 18 can be an<br>
adhesive composition such as an ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA), ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate (EVA), or ethylene methylacrylate (EMA) copolymer, or another suitable<br>
adhesive.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, an outer conductor 20 closely surrounds the<br>
dielectric layer 16. The outer conductor 20 advantageously prevents leakage of the<br>
signals being transmitted by the center conductor 14 and interference from outside<br>
signals. The outer conductor 20 preferably includes a laminated shielding tape 22<br>
that extends longitudinally along the cable 10. Preferably, the shielding tape 22 is<br>
longitudinally applied such that the edges of the shielding tape are either in<br>
abutting relationship or are overlapping to provide 100% shielding coverage.<br>
More preferably, the longitudinal edges of the shielding tape 22 are overlapped.<br>
The shielding tape 22 includes at least one conductive layer such as a thin metallic<br>
foil layer. Preferably, the shielding tape is a bonded laminate tape including a<br><br>
polymer layer 24 with metal layers 26 and 28 bonded to opposite sides of the<br>
polymer layer. The polymer layer 24 is preferably a polyolefin (e.g.<br>
polypropylene) or a polyester film. The metal layers 26 and 28 are preferably thin<br>
aluminum foil layers. To prevent cracking of the aluminum in bending, the<br>
aluminum foil layers 26 and 28 can be formed of an aluminum alloy having<br>
generally the same tensile and elongation properties as the polymer layer 24.<br>
The shielding tape 22 is preferably bonded to the dielectric layer 16<br>
by a thin adhesive layer 30 (e.g., having a thickness of less than 1 mil). More<br>
preferably, the shielding tape 22 includes an adhesive on one surface thereof such<br>
as an ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA), ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), or ethylene<br>
methylacrylate (EMA) copolymer to provide the adhesive layer 30 between the<br>
dielectric layer 16 and the shielding tape. Alternatively, however, the adhesive<br>
layer 30 can be provided by other suitable means to the outer surface of the<br>
dielectric layer 16. Preferably, the shielding tape 22 is a bonded aluminum-<br>
polypropylene-aluminum laminate tape with an EAA copolymer adhesive backing.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the outer conductor 20 preferably further<br>
includes a braid 40 that surrounds the shielding tape 22 and is formed by<br>
interlacing a first plurality of elongate aluminum wires 42 and a second plurality of<br>
elongate aluminum wires 44. Preferably, the braid 40 uses 34 AWG aluminum<br>
braid wires. The braid 40 preferably covers a substantial portion of the shielding<br>
tape 22, e.g., greater than 40% of the shielding tape, and more preferably greater<br>
than 65%, to increase the shielding of the outer conductor 20.<br>
As an alternative to forming a braid 40, a plurality of elongate<br>
aluminum wires 46 can be helically arranged around the underlying laminate tape<br>
22 as shown in Figure 2. A second plurality of elongate aluminum strands (not<br>
shown) can also surround the plurality of elongate wires 46, preferably having an<br>
opposite helical orientation than the elongate wires 46, e.g., a counterclockwise<br>
orientation as opposed to a clockwise orientation. Like the braid wires 42 and 44,<br>
the elongate wires 46 are preferably AWG aluminum braid wire and preferably<br>
cover a substantial portion of the shielding tape 22, e.g., greater than 40% of the<br>
shielding tape, and more preferably greater than 65%, to increase the shielding of<br>
the outer conductor 20.<br><br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, a cable jacket 50 can optionally<br>
surround the outer conductor 22 to further protect the cable from moisture and<br>
other environmental effects. The jacket 50 is preferably formed of a non-<br>
conductive, thermoplastic material such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
polyurethane and rubbers. Alternatively, low smoke insulation such as a<br>
fluorinated polymer can be used if the cable 10 is to be installed in air plenums<br>
requiring compliance with the requirements of UL910.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a corrosion-protected cable 60 according to<br>
another embodiment of the invention. The corrosion-protected cable 60 is of the<br>
type typically used for trunk and distribution cable for the long distance<br>
transmission of RF signals such as cable television signals, cellular telephone<br>
signals, internet, data and the like. The cable 60 illustrated in Figure 3 typically is<br>
of the type typically having a diameter of between about 0.3 and about 1.5 inches.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, the coaxial cable comprises a center<br>
conductor 61 of a suitable electrically conductive material and a surrounding<br>
dielectric layer 62. The center conductor 61 is preferably formed of copper,<br>
copper-clad aluminum, copper-clad steel, or aluminum. In addition, as illustrated<br>
in Figure 3, the center conductor 61 is typically a solid conductor. Nevertheless,<br>
the center conductor 61 can also be a hollow tube and can further include a<br>
supporting material within the tube as described in coassigned and copending U.S.<br>
Application Serial No. 09/485,656, filed February 14, 2000. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 3, only a single center conductor 61 is shown, as this is the<br>
most common arrangement for coaxial cables of the type used for transmitting RF<br>
signals. However, it would be understood by those skilled in the art that the<br>
present invention is also applicable to coaxial cables having more than one<br>
conductor in the center of the cable 60.<br>
A dielectric layer 62 surrounds the center conductor 61. The<br>
dielectric layer 62 is a low loss dielectric formed of a suitable plastic such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene. Preferably, to reduce the mass of the<br>
dielectric per unit length and thus the dielectric constant, the dielectric material is<br>
an expanded cellular foam composition, and in particular, a closed cell foam<br>
composition is preferred because of its resistance to moisture transmission. The<br><br>
dielectric layer 62 is preferably a continuous cylindrical wall of expanded foam<br>
plastic dielectric material and is more preferably a foamed polyethylene, e.g., high-<br>
density polyethylene. As discussed above with respect to Figures 1 and 2, in<br>
addition to the dielectric layer 62, the cable 60 can include a thin polymeric layer<br>
63. Preferably, the thin polymeric layer 63 is a corrosion-inhibiting layer<br>
comprising a polymeric material and a corrosion-inhibiting compound but this<br>
layer can alternatively be an adhesive composition.<br>
Although the dielectric layer 62 of the invention generally consists<br>
of a foam material having a generally uniform density, the dielectric layer 62 may<br>
have a gradient or graduated density such that the density of the dielectric increases<br>
radially from the center conductor 61 to the outside surface of the dielectric layer,<br>
either in a continuous or a step-wise fashion. For example, a foam-solid laminate<br>
dielectric can be used wherein the dielectric 62 comprises a low-density foam<br>
dielectric layer surrounded by a solid dielectric layer. These constructions can be<br>
used to enhance the compressive strength and bending properties of the cable and<br>
permit reduced densities as low as 0.10 g/cc along the center conductor 61. The<br>
lower density of the foam dielectric 62 along the center conductor 61 enhances the<br>
velocity of RF signal propagation and reduces signal attenuation.<br>
Closely surrounding the dielectric layer 62 is an outer conductor 64.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 3, the outer conductor 64 is a tubular<br>
metallic sheath. The outer conductor 64 is preferably characterized by being<br>
continuous, both mechanically and electrically, to allow the outer conductor 64 to<br>
mechanically and electrically seal the cable from outside influences as well as to<br>
prevent the leakage of RF radiation. Alternatively, the outer conductor 64 can be<br>
perforated to allow controlled leakage of RF energy for certain specialized<br>
radiating cable applications. The outer conductor 64 is preferably a thin walled<br>
aluminum sheath having a wall thickness selected so as to maintain a T/D ratio<br>
(ratio of wall thickness to outer diameter) of less than 2.5 percent and preferably<br>
less than 1.6 percent. Although the outer conductor 64 can be corrugated, it is<br>
preferably smooth-walled. The smooth-walled construction optimizes the<br>
geometry of the cable to reduce contact resistance and variability of the cable when<br>
connectorized and to eliminate signal leakage at the connector.<br><br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 3, the outer conductor 64 is<br>
preferably made from an aluminum strip that is formed into a tubular configuration<br>
with the opposing side edges butted together, and with the butted edges<br>
continuously joined by a continuous longitudinal weld, indicated at 65.<br>
Nevertheless, other materials such as a copper strip can be used in place of the<br>
aluminum strip. While production of the outer conductor 64 by longitudinal<br>
welding has been illustrated as preferred for this embodiment, persons skilled in<br>
the art will recognize that other methods for producing a mechanically and<br>
electrically continuous thin walled tubular copper sheath could also be employed<br>
such as overlapping the longitudinal edges of the aluminum strip.<br>
The inner surface of the outer conductor 64 is preferably<br>
continuously bonded throughout its length and throughout its circumferential<br>
extent to the outer surface of the dielectric layer 62 by a thin layer of adhesive 66<br>
(e.g. less than 1 mil) using the adhesive materials discussed above.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, a protective jacket 68 can optionally be<br>
included to surround the outer conductor 64. Suitable compositions for the outer<br>
protective jacket 68 include thermoplastic coating materials such as those<br>
discussed above. Although the jacket 68 illustrated in Figure 3 consists of only<br>
one layer of material, laminated multiple jacket layers may also be employed to<br>
improve toughness, strippability, burn resistance, the reduction of smoke<br>
generation, ultraviolet and weatherability resistance, protection against rodent<br>
gnaw through, strength resistance, chemical resistance and/or cut-through<br>
resistance.<br>
In accordance with the invention, at least an outer portion of the<br>
outer conductor 20 (Figures 1 and 2) and the outer conductor 64 (Figure 3) is<br>
coated with a corrosion-inhibiting coating. The corrosion-inhibiting coating is<br>
coated on the outer conductor in an amount sufficient to protect the outer<br>
conductor from moisture and to prevent corrosion of the outer conductor.<br>
Preferably, the corrosion-inhibiting coating is coated on at least a significant<br>
portion of the outer surface of the outer conductor, e.g., to provide 95% or greater<br>
surface coverage of the outer portion of the outer conductor. The corrosion-<br>
inhibiting coating comprises a corrosion-inhibiting compound and is formed by<br><br>
heating the corrosion-inhibiting composition discussed below. In addition, the<br>
corrosion-inhibiting coating can include a residual amount of an oil dispersant<br>
and/or a residual amount of a stabilizer. For example, the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
coating preferably includes less than 5% by weight of the oil and less than 5% by<br>
weight of the stabilizer, more preferably less than 2% of each of these components.<br>
The corrosion-inhibiting composition of the invention includes a<br>
corrosion-inhibiting compound dispersed in an oil, and a stabilizer to maintain the<br>
dispersion. The corrosion-inhibiting compound is typically an oil-soluble, water-<br>
insoluble compound and can be selected from the group consisting of petroleum<br>
sulfonates, benzotriazoles, alkylbenzotriazoles, benzimidazoles, guanadino<br>
benzimidazoles, phenyl benzimidazoles, tolyltriazoles, metcaptotriazoles,<br>
mercaptobenzotriazoles, and. salts thereof. Preferably, the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compound is a petroleum sulfonate salt. The petroleum sulfonate salts of the<br>
invention are preferably produced by partially oxidizing an aliphatic petroleum<br>
fraction to produce oxygenated hydrocarbons. The oxygenated hydrocarbons are<br>
then neutralized with calcium and blended with a minor amount of sodium<br>
petroleum sulfonate and a hydrotreated heavy naphthenic petroleum distillate to<br>
facilitate handling. Alternatively, the petroleum sulfonate salts can be produced by<br>
other known methods such as by reacting sulfuric acid and petroleum distillates to<br>
produce olefinic sulfonic acids, neutralizing the olefinic sulfonic acids using an<br>
alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide,<br>
removing the sulfonates from the oil by suitable extraction media, and then further<br>
concentrating and purifying the petroleum sulfonate salts. The petroleum sulfonate<br>
salts are typically calcium, barium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, or ammonium<br>
salts, or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the petroleum sulfonate salts are calcium<br>
salts either alone or in combination with barium and/or sodium salts. The<br>
petroleum sulfonate salts preferably have a molecular weight of greater than about<br>
400. In the preferred compositions used with the present invention, the petroleum<br>
sulfonate salts have an activity of greater than 0 to about 25% based on the calcium<br>
salt. Typically, the corrosion-inhibiting composition includes from about 5 to<br>
about 40 percent by weight, preferably from about 15 to about 30 percent by<br>
weight, of the corrosion-inhibiting compound (e.g. the petroleum sulfonate salt).<br><br>
The corrosion-inhibiting compound is dispersed in an oil in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Preferably, the oil is a paraffinic oil such as<br>
a mineral oil. The paraffinic oil includes long chain aliphatic components and<br>
preferably has a low molecular weight of less than about 600, more preferably, less<br>
than about 500 (e.g. from about 400 to about 500). In addition, the oil can include<br>
a small amount of a hydrotreated heavy naphthenic petroleum distillate as these<br>
distillates are often used to facilitate handling of the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compound. The oil is present in the corrosion-inhibiting composition in an amount<br>
from about 50 to about 90 percent by weight, more preferably from about 60 to<br>
about 80 percent by weight.<br>
The corrosion-inhibiting composition further includes a stabilizer to<br>
maintain the dispersion between the corrosion-inhibiting compound and the oil. In<br>
particular, the stabilizer is selected from the group consisting of propylene based<br>
glycol ethers, propylene based glycol ether acetates, ethylene based glycol ethers,<br>
and ethylene based glycol ether acetates. For example, dipropylene glycol methyl<br>
ether acetate, propylene glycol methyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether,<br>
tripropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol t-butyl ether, propylene glycol<br>
methyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether,<br>
ethylene glycol butyl ether, diethylene glycol methyl ether, diethylene glycol ethyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol butyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate, ethylene<br>
glycol butyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol<br>
butyl ether acetate, and mixtures thereof, can be used as stabilizers in the present<br>
invention. Preferably, the stabilizer for use in the invention is a dipropylene glycol<br>
ether acetate and is more preferably dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate. The<br>
corrosion-inhibiting composition preferably includes from about 1% to about 10%<br>
by weight of the stabilizer, more preferably from about 3 to about 8 percent by<br>
weight of the stabilizer.<br>
The stabilizers mentioned above have.been found to be particularly<br>
useful in the compositions of the invention in preventing the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compounds, and particularly, the petroleum sulfonate salts, from precipitating out<br>
of the oil. Specifically, the stabilizers allow for larger amounts of the corrosion-<br>
inhibiting compounds (about 15% by weight or greater) to be used in the<br><br>
corrosion-inhibiting compositions without precipitation of the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
compounds.<br>
For use with the cables of the invention, the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition preferably has a viscosity of from about 50 to about 450 SSU at<br>
100°F. A particularly preferred composition for use with the cables of the<br>
invention is a combination of a calcium petroleum sulfonate, mineral oil, and a<br>
dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate stabilizer. This composition is<br>
commercially available, e.g., from ArroChem Inc. in Mount Holly, North Carolina<br>
as Anti Corrosion Lube 310, which has a flash point &gt; 200°C, a specific gravity of<br>
0.8393, a viscosity of from 290 to 310 SSU at 100°F, and an activity of 10% based<br>
on the calcium salt.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a preferred method of making the coaxial cable<br>
10 of the invention. As shown in Figure 4, the center conductor 14 is advanced<br>
from a reel 70 along a predetermined path of travel (from left to right in Figure 4).<br>
In order to produce a coaxial cable having a continuous center conductor 14, the<br>
terminal edge of the center conductor from one reel is mated with the initial edge<br>
of the center conductor from a subsequent reel and welded together. It is important<br>
in forming a continuous cable to weld the center conductors from different reels<br>
without adversely affecting the surface characteristics and therefore the electrical<br>
properties of the center conductor 14.<br>
As the center conductor 14 advances, a suitable apparatus 72 such<br>
as an extruder apparatus or a spraying apparatus applies the thin polymeric layer<br>
18. The coated center conductor then further advances to an extruder apparatus 74<br>
that applies a polymer melt composition around the center conductor 14 and<br>
polymeric layer 18. As described above, the polymer melt composition is<br>
preferably a foamable polyethylene composition. Once the coated center<br>
conductor leaves the extruder apparatus 74, the polymer melt composition expands<br>
to form the dielectric layer 16. The center conductor 14, polymeric layer 18 and<br>
dielectric layer 16 form the cable core 76 of the cable 10. Once the cable core 76<br>
leaves the extruder apparatus 74 and is properly cooled, it can then be continuously<br>
advanced through the process shown in Figure 4 or can be collected on a reel<br>
before being further advanced through the process.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 4, as the cable core 76 advances, a shielding<br>
tape 22 is supplied from a reel 78 and is longitudinally wrapped or "cigarette-<br>
wrapped" around the cable core to form an electrically conductive shield. As<br>
mentioned above, the shielding tape 22 is preferably a bonded metal-polymer-<br>
metal laminate tape having an adhesive on one surface thereof. The shielding tape<br>
22 is applied with the adhesive surface positioned adjacent the underlying cable<br>
core 76. If an adhesive layer is not already included on the shielding tape 22, an<br>
adhesive layer can be applied by suitable means such as extrusion prior to<br>
longitudinally wrapping the shielding tape around the cable core 76. One or more<br>
guiding rolls 80 direct the shielding tape 22 around the cable core 76 with<br>
longitudinal edges of the shielding tape preferably overlapping to provide a<br>
conductive shield having 100% shielding coverage of the cable core.<br>
Once the shielding tape 22 is applied around the cable core 76, the<br>
corrosion-inhibiting composition of the invention can optionally be applied to the<br>
outer surface of the shielding tape by suitable means such as by using felt 81 to<br>
wipe the composition onto the outer surface. Alternatively, other means such as<br>
extruding or spraying the corrosion-inhibiting composition onto the outer surface<br>
of the shielding tape, or immersing the cable in the composition, can be used. As<br>
described below for the cable 10, the corrosion-inhibiting composition of the<br>
invention is preferably applied to the surrounding braided or helically served wires,<br>
and the shielding tape 22 precoated with a corrosion-inhibiting composition.<br>
Shielding tapes precoated with corrosion-inhibiting compositions and suitable for<br>
use in the invention are available, e.g., from Facile Holdings, Inc. in Paterson, NJ.<br>
As mentioned above, in the preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, a braid 40 is formed around the shielding tape 22 and<br>
combined with the shielding tape forms the outer conductor 20 of the cable 10. As<br>
shown schematically in Figure 4, the braid 40 is formed by feeding a first plurality<br>
of aluminum wires 42 and a second plurality of aluminum wires 44 from a<br>
plurality of bobbins 82 and interlacing the wires to form the braid. Preferably, the<br>
braid wires 42 and 44 are coated with the corrosion-inhibiting composition of the<br>
invention prior to braiding. Advantageously, the corrosion-inhibiting compound<br>
also acts as a lubricant and thus aids in the braiding of the wires. The corrosion-<br><br>
inhibiting composition of the invention can be applied to the braid wires 42 and 44<br>
either at wire drawing, spooling or braiding such as by wiping the composition<br>
onto the surface of the braid wires. For example, felts 84 can be used to wipe the<br>
corrosion-inhibiting composition onto the outer surface of the braid wires 42 and<br>
44. Alternatively, the corrosion-inhibiting composition can be applied by spraying<br>
the braid wires 42 and 44 or immersing the braid wires in the composition prior to<br>
braiding, by wiping or spraying the braid with the composition after it is formed, or<br>
by immersing the braided cable in the composition after the braid is formed.<br>
As an alternative to the embodiment of Figure 1, a plurality of<br>
elongate aluminum wires 46 can be helically arranged or "served" around the<br>
shielding tape 22 instead of forming a braid as shown in Figure 2. In this<br>
embodiment, the elongate wires 46 drawn from the bobbins 82 are not interlaced to<br>
form a braid but are instead helically wound around the shielding tape 22. The<br>
elongate wires 46 are preferably coated with the corrosion-inhibiting composition<br>
in the same manner as the braid wires 42 and 44 described above by wiping the<br>
composition onto the wires using, for example, the felts 81, or can be applied by<br>
the other means described above. Although not illustrated in Figure 4, an<br>
additional plurality of bobbins can be used to apply a second plurality of elongate<br>
wires around the first plurality of elongate strands 46, preferably having a helical<br>
orientation opposite that of the first plurality of elongate strands and coated with<br>
the corrosion-inhibiting composition.<br>
Once either the braid 40 has been formed around the shielding tape<br>
22 or the elongate wires 46 helically wound around the shielding tape 22 to form<br>
the outer conductor 20, the cable can be advanced to an extruder apparatus 86 and<br>
a polymer melt extruded at an elevated temperature (e.g. greater than about 250°F)<br>
around the elongate strands to form the cable jacket 50. The heat of the polymer<br>
melt activates the adhesive between the laminate tape 30 to form a bond between<br>
the laminate tape and the underlying dielectric 16. In addition, the heat of the<br>
polymer melt causes the oil and the dispersant in the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition to evaporate leaving the corrosion-inhibiting compound behind on the<br>
surface of the outer conductor 20. The cable jacket 50 can then be allowed to cool<br>
and the completed cable 10 taken up on a reel 88 for storage and shipment.<br><br>
Although a jacket is preferably applied as discussed above, the<br>
cable can be heated to evaporate the oil and dispersant in the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition without applying a jacket to the cable. Moreover, although less<br>
preferred, the corrosion-inhibiting composition can be left on the cable without<br>
heating the cable.<br>
Figures 5A and 5B illustrate another method embodiment of the<br>
invention corresponding to cables such as the cable 60 illustrated in Figure 3. As<br>
illustrated in Figure 5A, the center conductor 61 is directed from a suitable supply<br>
source, such as a reel 90. As mentioned above, to provide a coaxial cable having a<br>
continuous center conductor 14, the terminal edge of the center conductor from one<br>
reel is mated with the initial edge of the center conductor from a subsequent reel<br>
and welded together, preferably without adversely affecting the surface<br>
characteristics and therefore the electrical properties of the center conductor.<br>
The center conductor 61 is then preferably advanced to an extruder<br>
apparatus 98 or other suitable apparatus wherein it is coated with a polymeric<br>
material to form the thin polymeric layer 63. The coated center conductor 61 is<br>
then advanced to an extruder apparatus 100 that continuously applies a foamable<br>
polymer composition concentrically around the coated center conductor.<br>
Preferably, high-density polyethylene and low-density polyethylene are combined<br>
wim nucleating agents in the extruder apparatus 100 to form the polymer melt.<br>
Upon leaving the extruder 100, the foamable polymer composition foams and<br>
expands to form a dielectric layer 62 around the center conductor 61.<br>
In addition to the foamable polymer composition, an ethylene<br>
acrylic acid (EAA) adhesive composition or other suitable composition is<br>
preferably coextruded with the foamable polymer composition around the center<br>
conductor to form adhesive layer 66. Extruder apparatus 100 continuously<br>
extrudes the adhesive composition concentrically around the polymer melt to form<br>
an adhesive coated core 102. Although coextrusion of the adhesive composition<br>
with the foamable polymer composition is preferred, other suitable methods such<br>
as spraying, immersion, or extrusion in a separate apparatus can also be used to<br>
apply the adhesive layer 66 to the dielectric layer 62 to form the adhesive coated<br>
core 102.<br><br>
In order to produce low foam dielectric densities along the center<br>
conductor 61 of the cable 60, the method described above can be altered to provide<br>
a gradient or graduated density dielectric. For example, for a multilayer dielectric<br>
having a low density inner foam layer and a high density foam or solid outer layer,<br>
the polymer compositions forming the layers of the dielectric can be coextruded<br>
together and can further be coextruded with the adhesive composition forming<br>
adhesive layer 66. Alternatively, the dielectric layers can be extruded separately<br>
using successive extruder apparatus. Other suitable methods can also be used. For<br>
example, the temperature of the inner conductor 61 may be elevated to increase the<br>
size and therefore reduce the density of the cells along the inner conductor to form<br>
a dielectric having a radially increasing density.<br>
After leaving the extruder apparatus 100, the adhesive coated core<br>
102 is preferably cooled and then collected on a suitable container, such as reel<br>
110, prior to being advanced to the manufacturing process illustrated in Figure 5B.<br>
Alternatively, the adhesive coated core 102 can be continuously advanced to the<br>
manufacturing process of Figure 5B without being collected on a reel 110.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 5B, the adhesive coated core 102 can be<br>
drawn from reel 110 and further processed to form the coaxial cable 60. A narrow<br>
elongate strip S, preferably formed of aluminum, from a suitable supply source<br>
such as reel 114 is directed around the advancing core 102 and bent into a<br>
generally cylindrical form by guiderolls 116 so as to loosely encircle the core to<br>
form a tubular sheath 64. Opposing longitudinal edges of the strip S can then be<br>
moved into abutting relation and the strip advanced through a welding apparatus<br>
118 that forms a longitudinal weld 65 by joining the abutting edges of the strip S to<br>
form an electrically and mechanically continuous sheath 64 loosely surrounding<br>
the core 102. Alternatively, the strip S can be arranged such that the opposing<br>
longitudinal edges of the strip S overlap to form the electrically and mechanically<br>
continuous sheath 64.<br>
Once the sheath 64 is longitudinally welded, the sheath 64 can be<br>
formed into an oval configuration and weld flash scarfed from the sheath as set<br>
forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,959,245, especially if thin walled sheaths are being<br>
formed. Alternatively, or after the scarfing process, the core 102 and surrounding<br><br>
sheath 64 can advance directly through at least one sinking die 120 that sinks the<br>
sheath onto the core 102, thereby causing compression of the dielectric 16. A<br>
lubricant is preferably applied to the surface of the sheath 64 as it advances<br>
through the sinking die 120. The cable then advances from the sinking die 120 to a<br>
suitable apparatus for applying the corrosion-inhibiting composition of the<br>
invention to the outer surface of the sheath 64. Preferably, the corrosion-inhibiting<br>
composition is applied to the sheath 64 by wiping the composition onto the sheath,<br>
e.g., by using felt 122 as illustrated in Figure 5B. Alternatively, other means such<br>
as extruding or spraying the corrosion-inhibiting composition onto the outer<br>
surface of the sheath 64, or immersing the thus-formed cable 60 in the composition<br>
can be used.<br>
Once the corrosion-inhibiting composition has been applied to the<br>
sheath 64, the cable can optionally be advanced to an extruder apparatus 124 and a<br>
polymer melt extruded concentrically around the sheath to produce a protective<br>
polymeric jacket 68. If multiple polymer layers are used to form the jacket 68, the<br>
polymer compositions forming the multiple layers may be coextruded together in<br>
surrounding relation to form the protective jacket. Additionally, a longitudinal<br>
tracer stripe of a polymer composition contrasting in color to the protective jacket<br>
68 can be coextruded with the polymer composition forming the jacket for labeling<br>
purposes.<br>
The heat of the polymer melt that produces the jacket 68 activates<br>
the adhesive layer 66 between the sheath 64 and the dielectric layer 62 to form a<br>
bond between the sheath and dielectric layer. In addition, the heat of the polymer<br>
composition causes the oil and dispersant in the corrosion-inhibiting composition<br>
to evaporate leaving the corrosion-inhibiting compound behind on the surface of<br>
the outer conductor 20. Once the protective jacket 68 has been applied, the coaxial<br>
cable is subsequently cooled to harden the jacket. However, as discussed above,<br>
the cable can be heated without applying a jacket or, less preferably, can proceed<br>
without heating. The thus produced cable can then be collected on a suitable<br>
container, such as areel 126 for storage and shipment.<br>
Unlike the flooding compounds and water-blocking compounds of<br>
the prior art, the corrosion-inhibiting coating of the invention do not have a greasy<br><br>
or sticky feel or texture in the finished cable. In particular, the oil and the<br>
stabilizer in the corrosion-inhibiting composition generally evaporate after the<br>
cable has been heated (e.g. by the application of the cable jacket) in much the same<br>
way that the lubricating oil used in braiding evaporates when heated such that the<br>
outer conductor includes only a residual amount of the oil and/or the stabilizer, if<br>
any. As a result, the outer conductor of the finished cable generally does not<br>
include the oily feel that the corrosion-inhibiting composition has at the time of<br>
application. Thus, unlike prior art corrosion-inhibiting coatings, the corrosion-<br>
inhibiting coating of the invention does not interfere with installation or<br>
connectorization of the cable. As would be understood by those skilled in the art,<br>
this is an important feature of the present invention and provides a real advantage<br>
over prior art corrosion-inhibiting compounds. As would be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art, in constructions that do not use cable jackets, the cable can be<br>
heated in a separate process step to evaporate the oil and provide the corrosion-<br>
protected cables of the invention.<br>
The corrosion-inhibiting compositions of the invention have been<br>
found to be particularly useful with outer conductors formed of aluminum.<br>
Specifically, with respect to aluminum outer conductors, it has been found that the<br>
corrosion-inhibiting compound produces a bond with the aluminum such that it is<br>
well maintained on the surface of the outer conductor.<br>
The corrosion-inhibiting compositions of the invention provide<br>
excellent protection to the outer conductor of the cable, and the cable as a whole.<br>
Although the present invention has been described for use with drop cable and<br>
trunk and distribution cable above, the present invention is not limited to these<br>
embodiments. In particular, the corrosion-inhibiting composition can be used with<br>
any type of cable wherein limiting the corrosion at conductors in the cable is<br>
important. In addition, although the corrosion-inhibiting compositions have been<br>
described for use with the outer conductor of coaxial cables, it would be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that it could also be applied to the inner<br>
conductors, or could be used with metals in other types of applications to provide<br>
corrosion protection.<br><br>
It is understood that upon reading the above description of the<br>
present invention and reviewing the accompanying drawings, one skilled in the art<br>
could make changes and variations therefrom. These changes and variations are<br>
included in the spirit and scope of the following appended claims.<br><br>
