TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"A System for Maintaining Intercooler Air Temperature During<br>
Engine Testing"<br>
(a) Gawande Avinash Anandrao<br>
(b) residing at<br>
29, Sambhaji Society, Senapati bapat Road Pune 411 016 State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for maintaining charged air temperature in the intercooler during engine testing. In particular the invention relates to a system that uses evaporative cooling heat exchange mode to maintain desired temperature of charged air / exhaust gas leaving the engine cylinder before entering turbocharger in the intercooler during engine testing.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
During engine testing as per established standards, it is necessary to maintain air<br>
inlet  temperature.	In   particular for turbocharged   engines  wherein  the<br>
temperature of aspirated air increases, it is necessary to maintain pre-defined temperature of the charged air, that is exhaust gas entering driving side of the turbocharger during the engine trial / test as per the established standards. To maintain the air temperature generally it is a practice to insert the intercooler \r\ the tank of water to cooi air and thereby maintain temperature of aspirated air to the engine during the trial / test. Further, the system is reported in literature wherein water / cooling medium is passed through the jacket surrounding the intercooler. However, in these systems, the lower heat transfer rate due to mere natural or forced convection imposes limitation on the desired air temperature.<br>
Related systems are reported in the prior art. They are as follows:<br>
United States Patent application 20070193731 discloses intercooler apparatus and method for better manufacturabilty of the Intercooler. It has flat tubes, corrugated ribs, collection tubes, connection pieces, and a connection plate used (for example) for the attachment of the heat exchanger in a casing through which charge air flows, whereby the individual components of the heat exchanger can be manufactured from aluminum and can be soldered together. The other configuration comprises of at least four collecting tubes define coolant collection chambers, whereby coolant follows at least one outgoing route lying between first and the second collection tubes, and at least one return route proceeding in an opposite direction lying between third and fourth collecting tubes.   However, this<br><br>
system does not provide any means for cooling the inlet air during the course of engine testing/trials.<br>
U.S. Patent 2005 0121006 discloses intercooler system and intake air cooling method. It comprises of air duct configured to be supplied with outside air, an evaporator and a heater core of an air-conditioning system being disposed within the air duct. An intercooler is supplied with the outside air from the air duct and configured to cool intake air passing there through using the outside air. A valve unit regulates flow of the outside air such that the outside air passes at least one of the evaporators and the heater core and is then supplied to the intercooler. Also, a control unit controls operation of the air-conditioning system and the valve unit. However, this system does not facilitate air cooling during engine test or trial.<br>
US Patent 4,632,178   The cited, prior work, though relating to intercooler, substantially is different than the present invention in terms of the former employing one heat exchanger for vapourizing liquid coolant and the other heat exchanger for condensing coolant vapour (claim 1), relying upon level sensing to control liquid flow between a reservoir and twin heat exchangers (claim 2), employing twin pumps ( claim 3), employing a relief valve (claim 4) and employing a discreet reservoir and a special displacement control valve (claim 5). The present invention employs none of the afore-mentioned constructive elements of the cited work.<br>
US 2007/0261682    - This prior, cited work discloses an engine after-cooling system, employing a compressor (claim 7), an air-conditioning or refrigeration unit (claim 3),<br><br>
an expansion valve ( claim 4), a variable-flow-rate-pump (claim 5) to vary flow rate of the coolant in response to the sensed inlet air temperature and the sensed ambient air temperature (claims 11 and 12) and a fan (claim 16). The present invention does not employ the afore-mentioned constructional components for its working and is substantially different than the cited, prior work in terms of construction and the working.<br>
US Patent 4,949,544 - This prior work of art discloses a series intercooler, comprised of three stages (claims 3 and 10), of which the third intercooler is evaporative cooler (claim 12). The prior work employs an accelerator (claim 14) and a variable effectivity heat exchanger as the second after-cooler (claim 19). The present invention is not a series intercooler and is not constructed of the afore-mentioned components of the prior work. The former is substantially different than the prior cited work.<br>
Patent CA 2298747 (also published as US 6,098,576) - This prior work discloses a split-cooling system, employing a four-way flow directing valve (claim 10), a three-way flow directing valve (claim 10) and a plate heat exchanger as oil cooler. The present invention functionally and constructionally is different than the cited work, employing none of the afore-mentioned components of the prior work.<br>
Patent KR100309383 - This prior work of art describes half submergence of intercooler in a tank by draining out water through a hole in the centre point of one the vertical sides of the tank, while water is jetted through a pipe, placed above the water tank, onto the intercooler. The present invention is different than the cited work in terms of the function<br><br>
performed to achieve larger extent of cooling the charged air. The Cited work relies upon half-cooling by natural convection under induced bubbling and the remainder-half cooling by jetting water in an open tank, involving externally jetting water for cooling from above the tank. The present work achieves far greater cooling through combined functioning of evaporative cooling and forced convection by means of parallel air currents. The combined functions are carried on the surface of the intercooler, where a thin film of water is formed and is replaced as soon as it is formed. The water in the film is partly vapourized, extracting a large chunk of the heat from the charged air, while the remainder of the film of water is vigorously and continuously agitated under air currents to efficiently remove by forced convection the remainder of heat from the charged air. Much larger heat transfer rate is achieved due to the combined functioning of the evaporative cooling and the forced convection under air turbulence. The present invention is substantially different from the cited work.<br>
The study of the related prior art reveals several technological gaps such as:<br>
•	lack of substantially high heat transfer rate as only natural or forced convection heat<br>
transfer is used;<br>
•	lack of flexibility of using other than heat transfer by forced convection.<br>
Necessity has been felt to develop a system that facilitates substantially higher heat transfer rate so as to facilitate substantial temperature reduction of air in the intercooler during engine testing.<br><br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
Main object of the present invention is to provide a system to facilitate substantial temperature reduction of air in the intercooler during engine testing.<br>
Yet, another object of the present invention is to provide a system that uses evaporative cooling for heat exchange so as to achieve effective heat extraction from air in the intercooler.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to devise a system that facilitates a combination of forced convection as well as evaporative cooling means for heat extraction from charged air in the intercooler.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to maintain charged air pressure across the system.<br>
