				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a water supply unit for supplying persons with disinfected water for hygiene purposes and/or as drinking water.<br>
Water supply units for supplying persons with disinfected water for hygiene purposes and/or as drinking water, consisting of a first water intake module, a second water disinfection module and at least one third water dispensing module, whereby the modules are connected with each other by lines and the second and third modules are integrated into one structural assembly, are essentially known in the building trade and in recreation. As a rule, they are at least partly connected to general utility lines. As a rule, the water is disinfected in a conventional manner by chemical means. A device with a multi-stage filtration and disinfection arrangement that is supplied with solar energy is known from FR-A-26 44 812.<br>
Object of the present invention is to create such a water supply unit which is self-contained, can be operated with a minimum energy requirement, and can be transported and installed at any time.<br>
This object is achieved by the present invention and advantageous embodiments and further developments are described herein.<br>
The present invention relates to a water supply unit for supplying persons with disinfected water for hygiene purposes and/or as drinking water, consisting of a first water intake module, a second water disinfection module, and at least one third water dispensing module, whereby the modules are connected with each other by lines and the second and third modules are integrated into one structural assembly, characterized in that the water intake module is a deep-well pump, that the intake water is delivered to a storage tank, that a radiation source emitting UV waves for disinfecting the water is installed in the storage tank, that the disinfected water is delivered to at least one water dispensing module, that the deep-well pump, the radiation source and the associated<br><br>
control units are supplied by a low-voltage D.C. power source, and that the structural unit consists of at least one hygiene compartment in the form of a container, whereby water dispensing modules such as water taps, shower heads, toilets, etc. are installed inside and outside the hygiene compartment.<br>
With these characteristics it is possible to ensure a supply of water for hygiene and drinking purposes where no public utilities are available, i.e. particularly in undeveloped areas. Since such water supply units are easily transported and installed, it is also possible to react to any sudden local demand. Furthermore, the UV radiation source is able to destroy not only the usual bacteria, but also parasites, which means that the unit can also be used in areas where the natural water supply is problematic.<br>
Preferably, the water supply unit is equipped in such a way that water-dispensing modules are provided inside and outside the hygiene compartment, such as water taps, shower heads, toilets, etc. The solar module(s) is/are installed on the roof of the hygiene compartment. Preferably, there are at least two hygiene compartments with passages between them in the form of housings in which the storage tanks are provided.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there are means for heating the disinfected water. Preferably, the service water is delivered through an outlet line 15 to a filtration module for purification, while the purified service water is returned into the storage tank.<br>
Below, the invention is more closely described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawing, where<br>
Fig. 1    shows a water supply unit 1 according to the invention. Next to a container<br>
compartment 2, a storage tank 4 for water is arranged on a rack 3. The water is pumped from a deep well 6 with a deep-well pump 5 through an intake line 7 into storage tank 4. For example, one such deep-well pump is a solenoid submersion pump that can be operated with low voltage and is supplied by a solar module.<br><br>
Thanks to a special capacitor short-term storage circuit, such a pump can deliver water even at a solar module capacity of 1 W. Thus it is possible to deliver 200 to 1000 litres a day. With new models, the pumping depth can be far greater than 10m.<br>
In storage tank 4, a radiation unit consisting of a watertight UV radiation source wrapped in special quartz glass and provided with an electronic control unit (described, for example, in Application DE-U-299 10 816.3) for the emission of UV waves, preferably with a wavelength of 254 Âµm. These waves propagate in the storage tank and destroy the genetic information of infectious microorganisms. The radiation source 8 and the control unit are supplied by a low voltage D.C. power source.<br>
The low voltage D.C. power source for the deep-well pump 5 and the radiation source 8 is at least one solar module 12 installed on the roof of the container compartment 2. Cables 13 lead to a bottom 14 of tank 4, where they are connected with the control units of the deep-well pump 5 and the radiation source 8.<br>
Tank 4 can be operated as a continuous-flow storage tank with constant radiation, or it can be periodically filled and periodically disinfected. It is connected with the water installation of container compartment 2 via an input line 9, and it can thus, for example, supply a shower head 10 and a water tap 11. In the present example of this embodiment, the water tap 11 is installed for a drinking water supply outside the container compartment, while the plumbing installations are inside the container compartment 2. This allows simultaneous use and privacy. As mentioned above, it may be economical to connect several container compartments by means of storage/control units.<br><br>
I CLAIM<br>
1.	Water supply unit for supplying persons with disinfected water for hygiene purposes and/or as drinking water, consisting of a first water intake module, a second water disinfection module, and at least one third water dispensing module, whereby the modules are connected with each other by lines and the second and third modules are integrated into one structural assembly, characterized in that the water intake module is a deep-well pump (5), that the intake water is delivered to a storage tank (4), that a radiation source (8) emitting UV waves for disinfecting the water is installed in the storage tank (4), that the disinfected water is delivered to at least one water dispensing module (10, 11), that the deep-well pump (5), the radiation source (8) and the associated control units are supplied by a low-voltage D.C. power source, and that the structural unit consists of at least one hygiene compartment (2) in the form of a container, whereby water dispensing modules such as water taps (11), shower heads (10), toilets, etc. are installed inside and outside the hygiene compartment.<br>
2.	Water supply unit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the low-voltage D.C. power source consists of at least one solar module (12).<br>
3.	Water supply unit as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the solar modules(s) (12) is/are installed on the roof of the hygiene compartment (2).<br>
4.	Water supply unit as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein there are at least two hygiene compartments (2), that passages are provided between them in the form of housings, and that storage tanks are arranged inside same.<br>
5.	Water supply unit as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein there are means for heating the disinfected water.<br><br>
6.	Water supply unit as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 5, wherein the service<br>
water for purification is delivered into a filtration module, and that the purified service<br>
water is returned into the storage tank.<br>
7.	Water supply unit, substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing.</td>
