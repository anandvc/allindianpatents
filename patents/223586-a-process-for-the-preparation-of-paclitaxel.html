				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PACLITAXEL<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of Paclitaxel.<br>
Paclitaxel is a molecule of natural origin having wide spectrum antitumor activity, with the following structural formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compound, first recovered from Taxus brevifolia bark and from other natural sources, can be prepared semi-synthetically according to a number of procedures described in both scientific and. patent literature.<br>
US-4,924,011 discloses the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel using 10-deacetylbaccatine III protected at the C-7 hydroxyl with a triaikylsilyl<br>
group and subsequently acetylated at C-10. The resulting intermediate is<br>
reacted with (2R,3S)-N-benzoyl-2-O-(l-ethoxyethyl)-3-pbenyl-isoserine and<br>
the resulting product is deprotected to give paclitaxel.<br>
WO-93/06094 discloses the preparation of paclitaxel by reacting a P-lactam precursor with 7-0-triethylsilyl-baccatine III, followed by mild acid hydrolysis.<br>
According to US-5,476,954, paclitaxel is prepared starting from 10-deacetylbaccatine III esterified at C-7 with a 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group (TROC).<br>
According to US-5,917,062 and US 6,020,507, the C-7 hydroxy] is protected with carbobenzoxy (CBZ) or with carbo-t-butoxy (Boc), followed by<br>
selective acetylation of C-10 hydroxyl.<br>
It is apparent from literature that a crucial aspect of paclitaxel semi-synthesis is to selectively protect the hydroxyls on the diterpen moiety (10-deacetylbaccatine III skeleton). The C-7 position is the most reactive and is therefore functionalized with groups which are easy to remove subsequently. The most commonly used group is triethylsilyl (TES), which is stable under the conditions used for the esterification of the other hydroxyls involved in the synthesis, and provides about 85% conversion yield. Approximately 85% yields are obtained when an acetyl group is subsequently introduced at the C-10 position.<br>
A novel process for the synthesis of paclitaxel has now been found, which provides higher final yields as well as other advantages compared with the known processes.<br>
The process according to the invention comprises the following steps: a)       protection   of   the   hydroxyls   at   the   7-    and    10-   positions   of 10-deacetylbaccatine III (10-DAB III),<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein   R=R'=trichloroacetyl,   or   R'=acetyl    and   R   is   selected   from<br>
t-butoxycarbonyl and trichloroacetyl,<br>
b)       esterification of the hydroxyl at 13 with 3-phenyl-2-epoxypropionic<br>
acid<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
   removal of the protective groups at the 7- and 10- positions (1) if they both trichloroacetyl groups, followed by selective acetylation at the 10-position (2) and opening of the epoxide with sodium azide (3);    <br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
or, alternatively,<br>
c')      if R'= acetyl and R = trichloroacetyl, opening of the epoxide with sodium azide and simultaneous deprotection at the 7- position<br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
d)      reduction of the azido group to amino group<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
 e)       benzoylation to give the final product<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
The starting product is 10-deacetyl baccatine III (10-DAB III), which is extracted from the leaves of Taxus baccata. In the first step, 10-DAB III is quantitatively esterified at the C-7 and C-10 hydroxyls. When R=R'=trichloroacetyl, 10-DAB III is reacted with trichloroacetyl chloride in methylene chloride in the presence of triethylamine and of catalytic amounts<br>
of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). When R # R', first 10-DAB III is selectively acetylated with acetic anhydride in the presence of cerium, scandium, ytterbium salts, preferably CeC13.7H20. The resulting baccatine III is subsequently protected at C-7 with a t-butoxycarbonyl or trichloroacetyl group. The first can be introduced by reacting baccatine III with t-butoxy-pyrocarbonate in the presence of DMAP and ethyldiisopropylamine or, alternatively, following the procedure described in US 5,917,062. The trichloracetyl group can be introduced at position 7 by reaction with trichloroacetyl chloride in pyridine.<br>
In the subsequent step (b), the hydroxyl at position 13 is esterified with 3-phenyl-2-epoxypropionic acid, preferably with its ammonium salt in toluene in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DMAP and p-toluenesulfonic acid, thereby obtaining (2R,3R)-3-phenyl-2,3-epoxy-propionic acid baccatine III ester.<br>
When both protective groups R and R' are trichloroacetyl, they can be removed using the conditions and reagents described by Zheng et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 2001, and by Datta et al., J. Org. Chem., 1995, 60, 761. Preferably, the two trichloroacetyl groups are removed with two equivalents of ammonium hydroxide. The deprotected compound is selectively acetylated at position 10 with acetic anhydride in the presence of cerium, scandium or ytterbium salts, preferably CeCl3.7H2O.<br>
The resulting compound is reacted with NaN3 in aqueous methanol in the presence of methyl formate, in the conditions reported in literature (Yamaguchi T., Tetrahedron Letters 39, 5575-78, 1998), to provide the corresponding azide.<br>
Alternatively, when R = trichloroacetyl and R1 = acetyl (d), the oxirane reacts with NaN3 to give the corresponding azide with deprotection at the 7-position, corresponding to the compound obtained at step (c1).<br>
The azide is reduced to amine in the subsequent step (d). The reduction can be carried out with hydrogen on catalyst or with PPh3. The product obtained at the last step (e) is benzoylated at the amino group to give paclitaxel. Benzoylation can be carried out with benzoic anhydride either simultaneously to reduction or subsequently on the isolated reduced product, using stoichiometric amounts of benzoyl chloride in the presence of potassium carbonate.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it relates to a A process for the preparation of paclitaxel, which comprises the following steps: protection of the hydroxyls at the 7-and 10- positions of 10-deacetylbaccatine III (10-DAB III),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R=R'=trichloroacetyl, or R'-acetyl and R is selected from t-butoxycarbonyl and trichloroacetyl, esterification of the hydroxyl at the 13- position with 3-phenyl-2-epoxypropionic acid<br><br><br>

or, alternatively,<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention in greater detail.<br>
Example I-synthesis of 7-Trichloroacetyl-baccatine III<br>
In a 25 ml round-bottom flask, 0.603 g (1.03 mmol, 1.0 eq) of baccatine III were dissolved under magnetic stirring in 9.7 ml of dry pyridine at 25°C under nitrogen atmosphere. 138 ju. 1 (1.23 mmol, 1. 23 eq) of trichloroacetyl chloride were dropped into the clear pale yellow solution. 30 min after completion of the addition, a white precipitate formed. Further 120 p. 1 (1.07 mmol; 1 eq) of trichloroacetyl chloride were dropped into the reaction suspension, under the same conditions as above. After 20 min the solution had yellow-brown color. The almost complete conversion of the starting baccatine III was observed by TLC (Si02, n-hexane/EtOAc, 2: 3). The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2C12. The resulting solution was repeatedly washed with a CuS04 saturated solution, until pyridine had been completely removed (the solution had no longer blue color). The organic phase was concentrated under vacuum, dried over MgS04, filtered, and the solvent was evaporated, to obtain 0.612 g of a white-yellowish powder corresponding to 7-trichloroacetyl- baccatine III, having the following spectroscopic characteristics.<br>

Example II - synthesis of (2'R,3'R)-7-Trichloroacetyl-baccatine III-13-(3'-phenyl-2',3'-epoxypropionate)<br>
0.164 g (1.00 mmol, 1 eq) of freshly prepared 3-phenyl-2-epoxypropionic acid were dissolved at 0°C in 30 ml of anhydrous toluene. Subsequently 0.5 g (1 mmol, 0.68 eq) of 7-(trichloroacetyl)-baccatine III [7-(TCA)-baccatine III] were added under nitrogen atmosphere at 0°C. Finally, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC. 0.21 g, 1.00 mmol, 1.0 eq), 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP, 0.084 g, 0.68 mmol, 0.66 eq) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA, 0.17 g, 0.10 mmol, 0.1 eq) were added, in succession. The solution<br>
was then heated at 70°C under magnetic stirring and nitrogen flow. The<br>
progress of the reaction was controlled by TLC (Si02, n-hexane/EtOAc, 3:2).<br>
The first spot, having Rf = 0.28, corresponds to 7-(TCA)-baccatine III epoxy ester. The second spot, having Rf = 0.11, corresponds to 7-(TCA)- baccatine III. After 3 hours, the mixture was cooled and the suspended solid was filtered. The precipitated dicylohexylurea (DCU) was washed with CH:C12. The combined organic fractions were concentrated to dryness. The resulting crude (0.919 g) was chromatographed by flash chromatography (Si02: n-hexane/EtOAc, 3:2). 0.100 g (0.14 mmol, 20 %) of unreacted 7-TCA-baccatine III and 0.435 g (0.49 mmol, 73 %) of (2'R,3'R)-7-Trichloroacetyl-baccatine III-13-(3'-phenyl-2',3'-epoxypropionate) having the following<br>

Example III - synthesis of (2'R,3'R)-baccatine III-13-(3'-azido-2'-hydroxy-3'-phenyl -propionate.<br>
In a 25 ml one-necked round-bottom flask equipped with magnetic<br>
stirrer, 0.397 g (0.45 mmol, 1 eq) of (2'R,3'R)-7-trichloroacetyl-baccatine III<br>
13-(3'-phenyl-2',3'-epoxypropionate) were suspended at 25°C in 10.0 ml of CH3OH. 1.26 ml of H20, 1.26 ml of HCOOCH3 and 0.735 g (11.3 mmol, 25.0 eq) of sodium azide were added in succession. Temperature was raised to 50°C and the progress of the reaction was checked by TLC (Si02, CHCl3/EtOAc/MeOH, 12.0:2.0:0.3). Disappearance of the starting product and simultaneous formation of two products having Rf = 0.22 and 0.29, respectively, were observed. The product having Rf = 0.29 was subsequently identified as the final product, whereas the product with Rf = 0.22 was (2'R,3'R)-baccatine III-13-(3'-phenyl-2',3'-epoxypropionate) formed as a reaction intermediate. The product having Rf = 0.29 growths in time to the<br>
detriment of the product having Rf = 0.22. The reaction solution after 46 h had yellow brown color with a white precipitate (unreacted NaN3). The reaction was quenched after 46 h by addition of water, two further spots were observed, with Rf 0.38 and 0.13 (unrecovered decomposition products). The precipitated milky white solid was filtered, washed with water and then with AcOEt. A diphasic mixture was obtained, both phases being clear. The two phases were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with AcOEt and the combined organic phases were concentrated and dried over MgSO4. The mixture was filtered and the solvent was evaporated off, to obtain 0.335 g of a white-yellowish powder. The resulting crude was purified by flash chromatography (Si02, CHCl3/EtOAc/MeOH 12:2:0.3), to obtain 0.279 g (0.36 mmol; 80 %; Rf=0.22) of (2'R,3'R)-baccatine III-13-(3'-azido-2'-hydroxy-3'-phenyl -propionate).<br>

 Example IV - synthesis of N-debenzoyl-paclitaxel<br>
In a 25 ml two-necked round-bottom flask, 0.102 g (0.13 mmol, 1.0 eq) of (2'R3'R)-7-hydroxy-baccatine III-13-(3'-azido-2'-hydroxy-3'-phenyl-propionate) were dissolved in 5.2 ml of freshly distilled CH2Cl2 and the resulting pale yellow solution was added with H2O (0.05 ml), then with 0.071 g (0.26 mmol, 2.0 eq) of PPh3. The mixture was reacted at room temperature under magnetic stirring. After 16 h the reaction was checked by TLC (Si02. CHC13/CH3OH 9:1). The starting product (R,=0.61) had disappeared and a spot with Rf=0.19 was observed. The reaction was quenched by diluting the mixture (of pale yellow color with white precipitate) with CHC13. Afterwards, the mixture was washed with distilled H2O and then with a sodium chloride saturated solution (brine).
