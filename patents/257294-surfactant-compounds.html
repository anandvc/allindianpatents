				<td>Surfactant Compounds<br>
This invention relates to surfactant compounds which include oligo- or poly-meric esters made up<br>
of polyhydroxy hydrocarbyl, particularly saccharide, residues, and dicarboxylic acid residues,<br>
modified by the inclusion of a hydrophobic residue, and to the use of such compounds as<br>
surfactants, particularly as emulsifiers, especially in personal care formulations.<br>
For effective surfactancy in water based systems, e.g. oil in water emulsions, or dispersing solids in<br>
water, it is usually desirable to use surfactants which are relatively hydrophilic, and are typically<br>
moderately water soluble. Such surfactants usually have a high HLB (Hydrophile/Lipophile<br>
Balance), typically greater than 7 and commonly in the range 8 to 18. Conventionally this has been<br>
achieved by using alcohol ethoxylates having relatively long polyoxyethylene chains, typically<br>
including at least 10 and sometimes up to about 100 EO groups, for alcohols having C
chains, or by using fatty acid esters, usually mainly mono-esters of sugars such as sucrose.<br>
Correspondingly for effective surfactancy in oil based systems it is desirable to use surfactants that<br>
are relatively hydrophobic, usually oil soluble and often water insoluble, typically having a low HLB<br>
e.g. less than 7 and commonly in the range 4 to 6.<br>
The present invention is based on our finding that certain polyesters of polyols and dicarboxylic<br>
acids give intermediate oligomers or polymers that can be further esterified typically with<br>
monocarboxylic acids or monohydric alcohols to give compounds which have surfactant activity for<br>
example as oil in water emulsifiers. For convenience the intermediate materials may be simply<br>
referred to as oligoesters or oligomers.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a surfactant compound which is a fatty mono-or di-ester<br>
of a oligoester of a dicarboxylic acid and a polyol which after polyesterification retains at least one<br>
free hydroxyl group.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be fatty acid mono- or di-esters of bis-hydroxyl ended<br>
oligoesters; fatty alcohol mono- or di-esters of bis-carboxyl ended oligoesters; fatty acid or fatty<br>
alcohol mono-esters, or mixed fatty acid fatty alcohol bis-esters of mono-hydroxyl mono-carboxyl<br>
ended oligoesters and the invention includes these sub-types of compound.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention are of the formula (I)<br>
Rl-[OR20-C(0)-R3-(0)C]m-R4 (I)<br>
where<br>
R1 is H, a group R5(O)C-, or a group R6O-[C(O)-R3-(O)C]-;<br>
each R2 is independently a C3 to C10 hydrocarbyl group including at least 1 substituent free<br>
hydroxyl group;<br>
each R3 is independently a C1 to C20, particularly a C2 to C2Q. hydrocarbylene group;<br>
R4 is -OH, -OM where M is a salt forming metal, an amine or ammonium group, a group<br>
-OR6, or a group -OR20-R7;<br>
R5 is a C20 to C20 aliphatic hydrocarbyl group;<br>
each R6 is independently a CQ to 622 aliphatic hydrocarbyl group;<br>
R? is H or a group -C(O)R5 where R5 is independently as defined above; and<br>
m is from 1 to 20, particularly from 3 to 10, more particularly from 3.5 to 8;<br>
provided that at least one of R1 and R4 is or includes a group including a C7 to C21 hydrocarbyl<br>
group.<br>
Within the general formula (I) there are three main groups of compounds:<br>
a) fatty acid mono- and bis-esters of bis-hydroxyl ended oligoester intermediates, having the<br>
formula (la):<br>
R1 a-[OR20-C(0)-R3-(0)C]m-OR20-R4a (la)<br>
where<br>
each R2, each R3 and m are independently as defined in formula (I);<br>
R! a is a group R5(Q)C-; and<br>
R4a is -H, or a group -C(0)R5;<br>
where each R5 is independently as defined in formula (I);<br>
b) fatty acid or fatty alcohol mono- and fatty acid fatty alcohol bis-esters of hydroxyl carboxyl<br>
ended oligoester intermediates, having the formula (Ib):<br>
R1 b-[OR20-C(O)-R3-(O)C]m-R4b (Ib)<br>
each R2, each R3 and m are independently as defined in formula (I);<br>
R1b is H or a group R5(O)C-;<br>
R4b is -OH, -OM, where M is a salt forming metal {atom} or {an} amine or ammonium<br>
group, or a group -OR**;<br>
where each R5 and R6 is independently as defined in formula (I), provided that at least one<br>
of R1 D and R4b is or includes a CQ to â‚¬22 group; and<br>
c) fatty alcohol mono- and bis-esters of bis-carboxyl ended oligoester intermediates, having the<br>
formula (Ic):<br>
R1 c-[OR20-C(O)-R3-(0)C]m-OR4c (Ic)<br>
each R2, each R3 and m are independently as defined in formula (I);<br>
R1 c is a group R6O-C(O)-R3-(O)C-; and<br>
R4c is H or a salt forming metal {atom} or {an} amine or ammonium group or a group<br>
-OR6;<br>
where each R6 is independently as defined in formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the formula (la) include an "extra" residue of the polyol residue -OR20- and as<br>
the residue -OR2O- are the main source of hydrophilicity in the molecule it is likely that such<br>
compounds will be intended to be relatively hydrophilic, commonly water soluble and particularly<br>
having an HLB value of from 8 to 18. It is likely that such compounds will use relatively short fatty<br>
monocarboxylic acid chains e.g. C7 to C21 particularly C7 to C21in the final esters and will<br>
usually be mono-esters (di-esters being less hydrophilic).<br>
Compounds of the formula (Ib) have equal numbers of polyol and dicarboxylic acid residues and<br>
are likely to be intermediate in their hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity depending on the particular<br>
residues used and the length of the fatty chain(s) in the final esters.<br>
The compounds of the formula (Ic) include an "extra" residue of the -C(O)-R3-(O)C- dicarboxylic<br>
acid residue and as this is a source of hydrophobicity in the molecule it is likely that such<br>
compounds will be intended to be relatively hydrophobia, commonly water insoluble, often oil<br>
soluble and particularly having an HLB value of from 4 to 6 and may have relatively longer fatty<br>
chains in the final ester e.g. derived from C7 to C21, particularly C7 to C21 alcohols.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) are linear compounds in that the oligoester chain is shown as not<br>
being branched or crosslinked and the fatty group in R^ or R^ is shown as terminal on the<br>
oligoester chain. As is discussed below, the polyols [typically of the formula (II): HOR2OH] used in<br>
making the compounds of the formula (I) have hydroxyl functionality &gt;2, e.g. sorbitol has a total of<br>
6 hydroxyl groups, so there is a possibility that branching reactions may take place, similarly the<br>
dicarboxylic acid [typically of the formula (III): HOOC-R3-COOH] may include functionality that may<br>
enable branching e.g. further carboxyl group(s) or hydroxyl group(s). The compounds of the<br>
formula (I) have use as surfactants and in such uses it is desirable to avoid this type of branching<br>
as we believe it reduces the effectiveness of the compounds as surfactants. Desirably the<br>
proportion of such materials having a structure analogous to formula (I) but including branching in<br>
the oligoester chain is less than 20 wt%, more desirably less than 10 wt%, and particularly less<br>
than 5 wt% of the surfactant product.<br>
The hydrocarbyl group R2 can be considered as the residue of a corresponding polyol<br>
HO-R2-OH (II) after removing two hydroxyl groups. R2 is desirably an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group,<br>
which will usually be saturated, having from 3 to 10 and particularly 4 to 8, and especially 6, carbon<br>
atoms and it will usually be linear though ft may include branching. The residue R2 Includes at<br>
least 1 and more usually from 1 to 6, particularly 1 to 4 and especially 4, hydroxyl groups which will<br>
usually be secondary hydroxyl groups(see also below).<br>
To aid manufacture of the desired linear oligomeric intermediate products the polyol (II) desirably<br>
includes two relatively reactive hydroxyl groups, the remaining groups being substantially less<br>
reactive. Thus, in synthesis involving reaction of the polyol (II) with dicarboxylic acid (III) or a<br>
reactive derivative (see below), the predominant reaction is between the carboxylic acid groups<br>
and the more reactive hydroxyl groups to give linear oligomers [which are subsequently reacted<br>
with the monocarboxylic acid (IV) or a reactive derivative or alcohol (V) (see below)]. In particular,<br>
the polyol (II) will have two primary hydroxyl groups and 1 to 6, particularly 1 to 4 and especially 4,<br>
secondary hydroxyl groups.<br>
Particularly desirably, R2 is of the formula: -(CH2)p1(CHOH)p2(CH2)p3- where p1 and p3 are each<br>
independently from 1 to 3, desirably 1, and p2 is from 1 to 6, more usually from 1 to 4. The<br>
corresponding polyols include glycerol, 64 polyols such as threitol and erythritol, C5 polyols such<br>
as inositol, arabitol and xylitol and CQ polyols such as sorbitol. The C7 to C21 polyols are commonly<br>
the reduced or hydrogenated forms of the corresponding tetrose, pentose and hexose sugars. In<br>
such polyols there are two primary hydroxyl groups and 1 to 4 secondary hydroxyl groups. Usually<br>
it will be desirable to have a relatively large number of free hydroxyl groups to maximise the<br>
hydrophilic contribution of this part of the molecule, however, if desired the number of free hydroxyl<br>
groups can be less than the maximum possible e.g. 4 with sorbitol, either by reacting the groups<br>
e.g. by etherification or esterification, or by using modified polyols e.g. by forming sorbitan by the<br>
anhydridisation of sorbitol.<br>
It is possible to include relatively small proportions of polyol residues which have no free hydroxyl<br>
groups e.g. as derived from ethylene, diethylene, triethylene or propylene glycols or by reacting the<br>
polyol so that it only has 2 hydroxyl groups e.g. as in /so-sorbide derived by di-anhydridisation of<br>
sorbitol. However, as it is generally desirable to use this part of the molecule to provide<br>
hydrophilicity, the proportion of such residues will generally be low, typically an average of not<br>
more than 25 mol%, more usually not more than 10 mol%, and desirably not more than 5 mol% of<br>
the polyol residues in the molecule.<br>
The group R3 can be considered as the residue of the corresponding dicarboxylic acid<br>
HOOC-R3-COOH (III) after removing the carboxylic acid groups and the dicarboxylic acid (III) or a<br>
reactive derivative will usually be the synthetic precursor providing the group R3 to the compound<br>
of the invention. R3 can be saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched and can be aromatic e.g.<br>
a phenyl ring (thus giving a phthalic, terephthalic or ;so-phthalic dicarboxylic acid) or and desirably<br>
aliphatic, typically an alkylene or alkenylene group, and may be linear or branched, and may be<br>
cyclic though it is desirably open chain. Commonly R3 is a group: -(CH2)n-, where n is from 1 to<br>
10, usually from 2 to 10, particularly from 2 to 8, more particularly from 2 to 6. Because mixtures of<br>
different dicarboxylic acids (or reactive derivatives) may be used to make materials used in<br>
practice, n may appear to be non integral, because it will be an average. The group R3 Is usually<br>
unsubstituted, but may be substituted e.g. with further hydroxyl or carboxyl groups as in citric acid<br>
(which has both).<br>
The C7 to C21aliphatic hydrocarbyl group R5 can be considered as the residue of the<br>
corresponding carboxylic, particularly fatty, acid: R5COOH (IV) and within the compounds of the<br>
invention usually appears as part of a carboxyl residue R5(O)C-. Desirably, R5 is a C7 to C21<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or alkadienyl group. Generally within this range, it will be a Cj to Ci3 particularly a<br>
C7 to C21 group when the end product is desired to be hydrophilic and a C7 to C21group when<br>
the end product is desired to be hydrophobia<br>
The group R6 is a C7 to C21hydrocarby! group and can be considered as the residue of the<br>
corresponding, particularly fatty, alcohol R1OH (V) and within the compounds of the invention<br>
usually appears as part of a hydrocarbyloxy group -OR6. Desirably, R6 is a C7 to C21, group<br>
especially an alkyl, alkenyl or alkadienyl group.<br>
Each group R5 or R6 is independently desirably an alkyl, alkenyl or alkadienyl group. In use it may<br>
be desired to use a mixture of compounds having different groups R5 or R6 respectively, e.g. as<br>
derived from naturally occurring fats and oils or as /so-stearic acid or /so-stearyl alcohol<br>
respectively. Further R5 and R6 may each independently be straight chain or branched e.g. as<br>
derived from /so-stearic acid or /so-stearyl alcohol respectively, and saturated as derived from<br>
lauric, palmitic, stearic or /so-stearic acids or lauryl, palmityl, stearyl or /so-stearyl alcohol<br>
respectively; or unsaturated as derived from oleic, linoleic or palmitoleic acids or oleyl, linoleyl or<br>
palmitoleyl alcohols respectively.<br>
So-called "/so-stearic acid" is a commercially available material, e.g. from Uniqema, and is a<br>
mixture of acids having from 14 to 22, with about 2/3 having 18, carbon atoms, including short,<br>
mainly methyl but also including some ethyl, side chains, branching from the main chain mainly in<br>
the middle of the chain, typically about the 9-position e.g. from about the 6-position to about the<br>
12-position, in an 18 carbon molecule. The assay molecular weight (e.g. by acid number) is close<br>
to that of stearic acid, "/so-stearic acid" is a co-product (after separation and hydrogenation) from<br>
the manufacture of so-called "dimer acids" from C7 to C21 unsaturated (mainly oleic and linoleic) fatty<br>
acids by catalytic thermal polymerisation.<br>
M is a salt forming metal, an amine or ammonium group. Where M is metal it is particularly an<br>
alkali metal e.g. sodium or potassium atom; where M is amine it is particularly mono-, di- or tri-,<br>
alkyl or hydroxyalkyl amine, typically containing in total from 1 to 12 carbon atoms; and where M is<br>
ammonium, it may be unsubstituted or substituted e.g. with 1 to 4 alkyl groups, the typically<br>
containing in total from 1 to 16 carbon atoms.<br>
The index m represents the average number of repeat units in oligomeric ester part of the<br>
molecule. Typically m will be at least 3, more usually at least 3.5, and desirably at least 5, though<br>
not usually more than 20 and desirably not more than 10 and will desirably be from 3.5, especially<br>
4, to 7. As the number is an average, m may be non-integral.<br>
The properties of the compounds of the invention, particularly the HLB can be varied by choice of<br>
the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of the molecules. Thus increasing the length of the<br>
hydrocarbylene group R3 and/or the groups R5, and/or R6, when these are hydrocarbyl, will give a<br>
more hydrophobic product; and increasing the number of free hydroxyl groups in the group R2,<br>
generally linked with increasing length of the R2 chain, will increase the hydrophilicity of the<br>
compounds of the formula (I). Further, the bis-hydroxyl ended oligoester intermediates will<br>
generally give more hydrophilic products that corresponding mono-or bis-carboxyl ended<br>
intermediates because they will have a (slightly) higher proportion of hydroxyl containing groups.<br>
Where the compounds of the formula (I) have a free carboxyl group, then they may have anionic<br>
surfactant properties as well as non-ionic properties, especially under alkaline conditions (though<br>
being polyesters alkaline conditions may lead to some hydrolysis).<br>
The polymeric chain in the compounds of the invention will generally increase the molecular weight<br>
and size of the compounds as compared with e.g. alcohol ethoxylate surfactants. This may lead to<br>
useful properties as stabilisers at interfaces e.g. oil water interfaces, as in emulsions, because the<br>
molecules will be less easy to displace from the interface.<br>
The compounds of the invention and particularly of the formula (I) can be made by reacting a<br>
precursor oligoester (or a reactive derivative) with a reactant which is either or both of a fatty<br>
monocarboxylic acid (or a reactive derivative) or a fatty alcohol (or a reactive derivative) under<br>
esterification conditions. The reactant chosen in any particular case used will depend on whether<br>
the precursor oligoester is bis-hydroxyl ended, mono-hydroxyl mono-carboxyl ended or biscarboxyl<br>
ended. For bis-hydroxyl ended precursor oligoesters the reactant will be a carboxylic acid<br>
(or a reactive derivative) for bis-carboxyl ended precursor oligoesters the reactant will be an alcohol<br>
(or a reactive derivative) for mono-hydroxyl mono-carboxyl ended precursor oligoesters the<br>
reactant will be either a carboxylic acid (or a reactive derivative) or an alcohol (or a reactive<br>
derivative) when the desired product is the mono-ester and both such reactants when the desired<br>
product is the diester. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, it will often be the case that<br>
practical precursor oligoesters will be a mixture of two or possibly all three of the different end<br>
group types and the choice of subsequent reactant(s) may be determined by the particular mixture.<br>
The invention accordingly includes a method of making a surfactant compound of the invention<br>
which comprises reacting a precursor oligoester (or a reactive derivative) with a reactant which is<br>
either or both of fatty monocarboxylic acid (or a reactive derivative) or a fatty alcohol (or a reactive<br>
derivative) under esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of the oligoester<br>
intermediate.<br>
The invention particularly includes a method of making a compound of the formula (I) as defined<br>
above which comprises reacting a precursor oligoester (or a reactive derivative) with a reactant<br>
which is either or both of a CQ to 622 monocarboxylic acid (IV): R5COOH, or a reactive derivative,<br>
or a CQ to 022 alcohol (V): R^OH (or a reactive derivative) under esterification conditions to form a<br>
fatty ester surfactant of the formula (I).<br>
The oliogoester precursor is typically of the formula (VI):<br>
H-[OC(0)-R3-(0)C]n1-fOR20-C(0)-R3-(0)C]m1-[OR2]n2-OH (VI)<br>
where<br>
each R2 and each R3 are independently as defined for formula (I);<br>
ml is from 1 to 20, particularly from 3 to 10, more particularly from 3.5 to 8;<br>
n1 is 0 or 1; and<br>
n2 is 0 or 1<br>
provided that n1 and n2 are not both 1.<br>
If n1 and n2 were both 1 then in effect ml would be reduced by 1.<br>
Corresponding to the three sub groups of compounds of the invention as discussed above, the<br>
invention further includes:<br>
a a method of making a surfactant compound of the invention which comprises reacting a bishydroxyl<br>
ended precursor oligoester (or a reactive derivative) with a fatty monocarboxylic<br>
acid (or a reactive derivative) under esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of<br>
the oligoester intermediate; particularly<br>
a method of making a compound of the formula (I) as defined above which comprises<br>
reacting a precursor oligoester of the formula (Via below) as defined above (or a reactive<br>
derivative) with a CÂ§ to 622 monocarboxylic acid (IV): R5COOH (or a reactive derivative)<br>
under esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of the formula (la).<br>
b a method of making a surfactant compound of the invention which comprises reacting a<br>
mono-hydroxyl mono-carboxyl ended precursor oligoester (or a reactive derivative) with a<br>
fatty monocarboxylic acid (or a reactive derivative) and/or a fatty alcohol (or a reactive<br>
derivative) under esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of the oligoester<br>
intermediate; particularly<br>
a method of making a compound of the formula (I) as defined above which comprises<br>
reacting a precursor oligoester of the formula (Vlb below) as defined above (or a reactive<br>
derivative) with a reactant which is either or both of a Cg to 622 monocarboxylic acid<br>
(IV): R5COOH (or a reactive derivative) or a CQ to 622 alcohol (V): R6OH (or a reactive<br>
derivative) under esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of the formula (Ib);<br>
and<br>
c a method of making a surfactant compound of the invention which comprises reacting a biscarboxyl<br>
ended precursor oligoester (or a reactive derivative) with a fatty alcohol (or a<br>
reactive derivative) under esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of the<br>
oligoester intermediate; particularly<br>
a method of making a compound of the formula (I) as defined above which comprises<br>
reacting a precursor oligoester of the formula (Vic below) (or a reactive derivative) with a<br>
reactant which is aC7 to C21 alcohol (V): R6OH (or a reactive derivative) under<br>
esterification conditions to form a fatty ester surfactant of the formula (Ic).<br>
When the oligoester precursor is bis-hydroxy ended it will typically be of the formula (Via):<br>
H-[OR2-OC(O)-R3-(O)C]m-[OR2]-OH (Via)<br>
where R2, R3 and m are as defined above for formula (I); and will be reacted with an acid of the<br>
formula (IV), under esterification conditions, to make the compound of the formula (I). The molar<br>
proportion of acid of the formula (IV) will usually be at least 1 mole per mole of hydroxyl in oligomer<br>
(Via) that it is desired to esterify, generally 1 for a mono-ester and 2 for a di-ester. We have not<br>
generally found it necessary to use a significant molar excess of the monocarboxylic acid to<br>
promote formation of the ester product.<br>
When the oligoester precursor is mono-hydroxy mono-carboxy ended it will typically be of the<br>
formula (Vlb):<br>
H-[OR2-OC(0)-R3-(0)C]m-OH (Vlb)<br>
and will be reacted with an acid of the formula (IV) or alcohol of the formula (V), under esterification<br>
conditions to make the compound of the formula (I). The molar proportion of acid and/or alcohol<br>
will usually be at least 1 mole per mole of hydroxyl in oligomer (Vlb) that it is desired to esterify,<br>
generally 1 for a mono-ester and 2 for a di-ester (of course for the diester one of these moles will<br>
be derived from a mono-carboxylic acid and one from an alcohol). We have not generally found it<br>
necessary to use a significant molar excess of the monocarboxylic acid to promote formation of the<br>
ester product.<br>
When the oligoester precursor is bis-carboxy ended it will typically be of the formula (Vic):<br>
HO-C(O)-R3-(0)C-[OR2-OC(O)-R3-(0)C]m-OH (Vic)<br>
where R2, R3 and m are as defined above for formula (I); and will be reacted with an alcohol of the<br>
formula (V), under esterification conditions, to make the compound of the formula (I). The molar<br>
proportion of alcohol of the formula (V) will usually be at least 1 mole per mole of carboxyl in<br>
oligomer (Vic) that it is desired to esterify, generally 1 for a mono-ester and 2 for a di-ester.<br>
Of course, the immediate resulting product wilt be a statistical mixture of mono-ester, di-ester and<br>
unreacted oligomer the proportions depending on the proportions of the oligomer and acid and the<br>
reaction conditions employed.<br>
The precursor oligoesters of the formula (Via), (Vlb) and (Vic) can be made by reacting a polyol<br>
(III) and dicarboxylic acid (IV) under esterification conditions, "particularly using a catalyst e.g. an<br>
alkali catalyst. The particular nature of the oligoester or the proportions of the oligoesters (Via),<br>
(Vlb) and (Vic) in a mixture will depend on the effective molar ratio of the starting polyol (II) and<br>
dicarboxylic acid (III) and the reaction conditions used in the esterification reaction. Where the<br>
starting materials include groups that may be susceptible to decarboxylation reactions e.g. malonic<br>
acid, or to branching reactions e.g. tricarboxylic acids such as citric acid (which may also be<br>
susceptible to decarboxylation) the use of relatively gentle oligomerisation (esterification)<br>
conditions can be useful to obtain the desired product. We have found that not adding a separate<br>
catalyst (the acid groups in the starting materials will provide some catalysis), while operating<br>
under relatively moderate elevated temperatures as is described below, can enable successful<br>
reactions with such materials, particularly malonic and citric acids, where the use of catalysts may<br>
in effect act to promote side reactions to an undesirable extent.<br>
Especially where the polyol (II) has four or more carbon atoms and four or more hydroxyl groups,<br>
usually two primary hydroxyls and 2 or more secondary hydroxyls, it may be susceptible to react to<br>
form cyclic ethers. For example sorbitol can form sorbitan cyclic ethers which may react further to<br>
form the dicyclic diether /so-sorbide. This reduces the number of free hydroxyl groups and is thus<br>
generally undesirable, but may need to be taken into account in choosing the proportions of<br>
starting materials for making the intermediate oligoester. Where the intermediate oligomer is<br>
hydroxyl or predominantly hydroxyl ended, it may be desirable to use a molar excess of the polyol<br>
(II) to promote speedy polyesterification in making the intermediate, leaving unreacted polyol at this<br>
stage. We have not generally found it necessary to remove such unreacted polyol before the<br>
second stage reaction.<br>
We have found that it is practical to make the compounds of the formula (I), by first making the<br>
oligoester (VI) by reaction of polyol (II) and dicarboxylic acid (III) under alkali catalysis and then<br>
further reacting the oligomer with carboxylic acid (IV) and or alcohol (V). The same reaction vessel<br>
may be used and it may not be necessary to separate or purify the oligomer, before further<br>
reaction. Using alkali derived from alkali metals e.g. sodium or potassium hydroxide or carbonate,<br>
particularly mild alkali such as carbonates, especially potassium carbonate, appears to be effective,<br>
particularly when making oligoesters that are hydroxyl ended e.g. the bis-hydroxyl ended<br>
oligoesters especially of the formula (la). Further such catalysts can be used for the further<br>
esterification and it is thus possible to use the same catalyst used in the oligomerisation. If<br>
required further catalyst may be added between the first and second stages of reaction.<br>
In relation to the synthesis of the intermediate oligoesters, the present invention includes a method<br>
of making an oligoester which comprises reacting a polyol (or a reactive derivative) with a<br>
dicarboxylic acid (or a reactive derivative), under esterification conditions to form an oligoester.<br>
In this aspect, the invention particularly provides a method of making an oligoester of the<br>
formula (VI) as defined above which comprises reacting a polyol of the formula (II): HO-R2-OH, (or<br>
a reactive derivative) with a dicarboxylic acid of the formula (III): HOOC-R3-COOH, (or a reactive<br>
derivative), under esterification conditions to form the oligoester. As is noted above the oligoesters<br>
can be bis-hydroxyl ended of the formula (Via), bis-carboxyl ended of the formula (Vic), or monohydroxyl<br>
mono carboxyl ended of the formula (Via).<br>
Desirably the esterification conditions include:<br>
a the use of an alkali catalyst, particularly a mild alkali catalyst, especially potassium<br>
carbonate; and/or<br>
b a reaction temperature of from 100Â°C to 200Â°C, more usually from 120Â°C to 185Â°C and<br>
desirably from 150Â°Cto 180Â°C, e.g. about 170Â°C; and/or<br>
c a reaction pressure which is subambient, particularly from 50 to 250 mBar (0.5 to 25 kPa)<br>
e.g. about 100 mBar (10 kPa).<br>
In these reactions (making the oligoester intermediate or subsequent esterification to form the<br>
surfactant compounds) carboxylic acid functionality may be substituted by reactive derivatives such<br>
as lower e.g.C7 to C21l, particularly methyl or ethyl, esters, as in dialkyl esters of the<br>
dicarboxylic acid (III) or esters of the acid (IV) which may be glycerides such as triglycerides having<br>
residues of the fatty acid (IV), or anhydrides. We have successfully used acid anhydrides to make<br>
the intermediate oligoesters, but care may be needed when using anhydrides because they are<br>
relatively reactive and in making the oligomer they may react also with less reactive hydroxyl<br>
groups thus potentially leading to branched oligomers which are likely to form water insoluble or<br>
intractable gels of little value as emulsifiers even after subsequent esterification. Even more<br>
reactive carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid halides will not generally be used for this reason.<br>
Where esters are used as the source of the carboxylic acids, the catalyst used may be an alkali as<br>
described above or a catalyst specifically for trans-esterification reactions e.g. titanate ester such<br>
as tetrabutyl titanate.<br>
Particularly where the polyol used in making the oligoester intermediate has more than 3 hydroxyl<br>
groups e.g. where it has five or more hydroxyl groups, particularly on adjacent carbon atoms, the<br>
polyol may be liable to react such as by cyclising e.g. to form sorbitan from sorbitol, or pyrolysis, if<br>
heated sufficiently. Thus, when these materials are used, it is desirable to use temperatures that<br>
are lower that are typically in making carboxylic acid esters, particularly with relatively long chain<br>
acids. Typically, using such materials, the temperatures used will be at least 100Â°C, more usually<br>
at least 120Â°C and desirably at least 150Â°C, but not more than 200Â°C, more usually not more than<br>
185Â°C, particularly not more than 180Â°C, with reaction temperatures about 170Â°C, being particularly<br>
suitable. Such relatively mild esterification temperatures also appear to avoid or reduce the extent<br>
of reaction at secondary hydroxyl groups this minimising the degree of branching in the oligoester<br>
intermediate of side chain esterification in the surfactant compounds. The use of mildly<br>
subambient pressure e.g. from 50 to 250 mBar (0.5 to 25 kPa) e.g. about 100 mBar (10 kPa) can<br>
benefit reaction speed to make the use of such temperatures more practical.<br>
If the materials produced by the synthesis are coloured, particularly by coloured impurities, then the<br>
level of colour may be reduced by treatment with activated carbon and/or by bleaching e.g. with<br>
hydrogen peroxide particularly in making products for personal care end use applications.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be made to have a range of water and/or oil solubility and<br>
thus can be used as surfactants in water or oil based systems. In particular, the compounds of the<br>
invention may have HLB values in the range 4 to 18, including the relatively hydrophilic range 8 to<br>
18 and the relatively oleophilic (hydrophobic) range 4 to 6.<br>
Surfactants used in water based systems are generally water soluble, having an HLB greater than<br>
7, particularly from 8 to 18. Such materials can be used as oil in water emulsifiers, particularly in<br>
personal care applications; as dispersants for pigments; as emulsifiers in emulsion polymerisation;<br>
as wetting agents in aqueous systems; as surfactants in domestic detergents, particularly in<br>
laundry formulations; in crop protection formulations particularly as adjuvants, dispersants and/or<br>
emulsifiers in agrochemical formulations; and other applications.<br>
The properties of the surfactants of this invention also make them suitable as emulsifiers<br>
particularly in oil in water emulsions e.g. in personal care applications. Personal care emulsion<br>
products can take the form of creams and milks desirably and typically include emulsifier to aid<br>
formation and stability of the emulsion. Typically, personal care emulsion products use emulsifiers<br>
(including emulsion stabilisers) in amounts of about 3 to about 5% by weight of the emulsion.<br>
The oil phase of such emulsions are typically emollient oils of the type used in personal care or<br>
cosmetic products, which are oily materials which is liquid at ambient temperature or solid at<br>
ambient temperature, in bulk usually being a waxy solid, provided it is liquid at an elevated<br>
temperature, typically up to 100Â°C more usually about 80Â°C, so such solid emollients desirably<br>
have melting temperatures less than 100Â°C, and usually less than 70Â°C, at which it can be included<br>
in and emulsified in the composition.<br>
The concentration of the oil phase may vary widely and the amount of oil is typically from 1 to 90%,<br>
usually 3 to 60%, more usually 5 to 40%, particularly 8 to 20%, and especially 10 to 15% by weight<br>
of the total emulsion. The amount of water (or polyol, e.g. glycerin) present in the emulsion is<br>
typically greater than 5%, usually from 30 to 90%, more usually 50 to 90%, particularly 70 to 85%,<br>
and especially 75 to 80% by weight of the total composition. The amount of surfactant used on<br>
such emulsions is typically from 0.1 to 10%, more usually 0.5 to 8%, more desirably 1 to 7%,<br>
particularly 1.5 to 6%, and especially 2 to 5.5%, by weight of the emulsion.<br>
The end uses formulations of such emulsions include moisturizers, sunscreens, after sun products,<br>
body butters, gel creams, high perfume containing products, perfume creams, baby care products,<br>
hair conditioners, skin toning and skin whitening products, water-free products, anti-perspirant and<br>
deodorant products, tanning products, cleansers, 2-in-1 foaming emulsions, multiple emulsions,<br>
preservative free products, emulsifier free products, mild formulations, scrub formulations e.g.<br>
containing solid beads, silicone in water formulations, pigment containing products, sprayable<br>
emulsions, colour cosmetics, conditioners, shower products, foaming emulsions, make-up remover,<br>
eye make-up remover, and wipes. A preferred formulation type is a sunscreen containing one or<br>
more organic sunscreens and/or inorganic sunscreens such as metal oxides, but desirably includes<br>
at least one particulate titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide,<br>
The surfactants of this invention can be used as emulsifiers in emulsion polymerisation. Typically<br>
emulsion polymerisation is carried out on emulsions of ethylenically unsaturated monomers in<br>
water. Suitable monomers include unsaturated carboxylic acids and their alkyl esters, amides,<br>
N-substituted amides and nitriles, aromatic vinyl compounds, diene compounds which may be<br>
included as monomers or specifically as crosslinking agents, vinylethers, vinylesters, defines and<br>
hydrophobic allyl compounds.<br>
Such emulsion polymerisation methods are particularly applicable to the manufacture of acrylic<br>
copolymers, for example those where at least 50%, more usually at least 60%, desirably at least<br>
80% e.g. 90% or more up to 100%, by weight of the monomers are acrylic monomers. The acrylic<br>
polymers may be those based on mixed alkyl acrylates, especially where the predominant<br>
monomer is methyl methacrylate, and may include anionic units such as (meth)acrylic acid units or<br>
cationic units such as amino substituted ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
The amount of surfactant used will depend on the particular monomers and the polymerisation<br>
system used, the degree of colloidal stability needed and the desired particle size of the polymer in<br>
the product latex. For an otherwise conventional oil in water emulsion polymerisation, to give a<br>
latex having a particle size of from 80 to 500 nm the amount of surfactant used will typically be from<br>
0.25 to 5 parts by weight surfactant per 100 parts by weight total monomer (phm). More usually<br>
the amount will be from 0.5 to 2.5 phm, particularly from 1 to 2 phm.<br>
In microemulsion polymerisation systems, the concentration of monomer is typically substantially<br>
lower than in conventional emulsion or other dispersion polymerisation systems e.g. from 3 to 10%<br>
by weight. The proportion of surfactant relative to the amount of monomer is also relatively high<br>
because the microemulsion has higher interface area per unit mass of monomer corresponding to<br>
the smaller emulsion particle size and typical levels can be from 10 to 150 phm. Overall solids<br>
contents of microemulsion systems are usually in the range 15 to 30% by weight of the total<br>
emulsion.<br>
The surfactants of this, invention can be used as dispersants for solids in aqueous media,<br>
particularly for pigments, including inorganic pigments e.g. titanium dioxide, pigmentary iron oxide<br>
and organic pigments e.g. phthalocyanine pigments, carbon black, and similar materials. The<br>
amount of surfactant used in such dispersant applications depends on the materials employed and<br>
the dispersion concentration required, but is usually from 0.2 to 10% by weight of the solid e.g.<br>
pigment being dispersed. In aqueous dispersions, for inorganic pigments the amount used is<br>
typically from 0.05 to 5%, more usually 0.1 to 2.5%, by weight of the solid dispersed and for organic<br>
pigments typically the amount used is from 3 to 10% by weight of the solid dispersed. Typical such<br>
dispersions will contain up to about 70%, often up to about 65%, of inorganic pigment and up to<br>
about 35% by weight organic pigment, but this may be up to 50% for pigment pastes. When<br>
incorporated into end use products such as paints typical pigment levels in the final product will be<br>
about 3 to about 30%, particularly about 20 to about 25%, for inorganic pigments, about 1 to about<br>
15% for organic pigments, particularly about 10 to about 12%, especially for phthalocyanine type<br>
organic pigments, and about 0.5 to about 5%, particularly about 3 to about 3%, for carbon black.<br>
The continuous phase in such dispersions will usually be water based.<br>
The surfactants can also be used as domestic detergents for example in laundry applications and<br>
may be used alone or in combination with other, non-ionic, anionlc, cationic, amphoteric and/or<br>
zwitterionic surfactants. Formulations including surfactants of this invention for laundry use will<br>
typically also include further components including one or more of builders e.g. phosphates,<br>
particularly sodium tripolyphosphate; organics such as citrate and/or tartrate; and/or zeolites; flow<br>
and/or filter aids, commonly used in powder formulations, which may include co-builders such as<br>
sodium carbonate and/or bicarbonate, particularly in powders where the builder is a zeolite (though<br>
because typical co-builders are alkali, they will not usually be used in hand washing formulations);<br>
corrosion inhibitors; anti-redeposition aids such as carboxy methyl cellulose; and optical<br>
brighteners. Further components may include perfumes; enzymes, including lipases, proteases,<br>
cellulases and/or amylases; bleaches, typically based on sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate<br>
or similar materials, which will typically be used with bleach activators such as tetra-acetyl ethylene<br>
diamine (TAED); and stabilisers such as phosphonates or ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid<br>
(EOTA) usually as the sodium salt; soaps; foam control agents (often soaps) and fabric<br>
conditioners (softeners) such as quaternary ammonium salts and amine oxides which may be<br>
coated onto bentonite type clays.<br>
The compounds of the invention can used as surfactants in agrochemical formulations, in particular<br>
as adjuvants for example with herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides and plant growth<br>
regulator formulations, dispersants and/or emulsifiers. The amount of surfactant used to disperse<br>
agrochemical(s), is typically at a concentration of 1 to 30% based on the formulation and used as<br>
adjuvants, a concentration of from 5 to 60% based on concentrate formulations and 1 to 100% in or<br>
as components for addition to tankmixes. Other conventional components can be included in such<br>
formulations such as oils e.g. mineral oil(s), vegetable oil(s) and alkylated vegetable oil(s); solvents<br>
and/or diluents; and other surfactants which may be anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants or<br>
non-ionic surfactants. Such other components will, as with formulations using purely conventional<br>
surfactants, be used in amounts based on the desired effect.<br>
The surfactants of the invention can also be used in oilfield applications e.g. as foaming agents in<br>
foam drilling, as kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors and as water based drilling fluid lubricants.<br>
Foam drilling fluids are water based drilling fluids In which the water phase is foamed e.g. to<br>
minimise formation damage of water sensitive formations. As foaming agents in foam drilling fluids<br>
the amount of the surfactant used will typically be from 1 to 3%, more usually from 1 to 2%, by<br>
weight of the drilling fluid.<br>
Kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors are materials added to water containing hydrocarbon, particularly C1<br>
to C4 hydrocarbon alkane containing streams to slow down gas hydrate formation or to modify the<br>
crystal form of the gas hydrate so as to reduce crystal agglomeration which otherwise would lead to<br>
pipe or similar blockage. In gas hydrate inhibition, the surfactants will typically be used at from<br>
0.05 to 5% by weight based on the water phase of the stream being treated.<br>
The surfactant compounds of the invention may be used to provide enhanced lubricity in water<br>
based drilling fluids. In use in this application the amount of surfactant used will typically be from<br>
0.05 to 10% by weight of the fluid.<br>
Surfactants used in oil based systems are generally oil soluble and usually water insoluble and in<br>
particular having an HLB of less than 7, more usually from 4 to 6. Such materials can be used as<br>
emulsifiers and/or stabilisers for water in oil emulsions; or as dispersants for solids in non-aqueous<br>
liquids. As such they can be used in a wide variety of applications including in: (water in oil)<br>
emulsion polymerisations, particularly to make polyacrylamide (PAM) or related polymers by free<br>
radical inverse emulsion polymerisation (i-PAM); emulsion explosives; in water in oil cosmetic<br>
emulsions; agrochemical, particularly plant growth regulator, herbicide, and/or pesticide, emulsions<br>
dispersions and suspoemulsions; and as emulsifiers and/or dispersants; dispersions of solids, such<br>
as pigments and/or inert inorganic metal salts, especially in organic media; oilfield drilling fluid<br>
additives, particularly as dispersants and/or emulsifiers for drilling muds and invert emulsion drilling<br>
fluids; metal working applications particularly in rolling oil emulsions and cutting fluids.<br>
The surfactants of the invention can be used as emulsifiers in i-PAM'polymerisation, in which<br>
acrylamide and any co-monomer(s), are dissolved in water, this solution is emulsified in oil, using<br>
surfactants as emulsifiers and stabilisers, and the polymerisation initiated. The result is a<br>
dispersion of water droplets, containing dissolved PAM, in the oil. Although the viscosity of the<br>
aqueous PAM solution is high, the effective viscosity of the emulsion is determined primarily by the<br>
oil continuous phase, chosen to be suitably low. In use e.g. in water treatment, the emulsion has to<br>
be broken, usually by inverting on dilution into water. The surfactant system must provide<br>
adequate emulsion stability before, during and after (for storage) polymerisation, but permit ready<br>
breaking of the emulsion during inversion on dilution into water, to facilitate rapid release of the<br>
polyacrylamide polymer into the water phase in which it will act. Inversion is commonly promoted<br>
by the addition of hydrophilic surfactants after the polymerisation. Relatively oleophilic surfactants<br>
of the invention can be used to emulsify and/or stabilise the water in oil emulsion used in this type<br>
of polymerisation process.<br>
In i-PAM, the oil phase is typically a mineral oil, particularly a paraffin oil, or an ester oil and the<br>
amount of emulsifier surfactant used is typically from 2.5 to 7%, usually from 3 to 4%, by weight of<br>
the polymerisation emulsion. The emulsifier system will typically combine a polymeric surfactant,<br>
particularly including a surfactant of invention especially of the formula (I), and a low molecular<br>
weigh low HLB surfactant (relatively less effective as an emulsion stabiliser so that the stabilisation<br>
of the emulsion is not so good that inversion is difficult) - the low molecular weight enables it to<br>
readily diffuse away from the phase interface during inversion. Commonly the low molecular<br>
eight surfactants are fatty acid monoglycerides, fatty acid sorbitan esters or similar surfactants.<br>
The relative proportions by weight of polymeric surfactant to low HLB low molecular weight<br>
surfactant is typically from 5:95 to 50:50 more usually from 10:90 to 40:60 and commonly about<br>
15:85 to 30:70.<br>
Oleophilic types of surfactants of this invention can also be used in dispersing solids, particularly<br>
pigments such as those described above, in non-aqueous media such as white spirit or aromatic<br>
media. In such uses the amount of surfactant used will typically be from 0.5 to 7.5%, more usually<br>
from 1 to 5%, by weight of the dispersion.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also useful as emulsifiers or emulsion stabilisers in emulsion<br>
explosives in which an oxidiser, typically an aqueous solution of an oxidiser salt usually nitrates, is<br>
emulsified in a liquid fuel, typically a hydrocarbon fuel such as mineral and/or paraffin oil, which<br>
may also include other petroleum components e.g. micro-crystalline wax, paraffin wax, slack wax,<br>
and/or petroleum refining distillation residues. The oxidiser solution is usually a saturated or<br>
supersaturated aqueous solution, of nitrate salts, particularly C7 to C21 alkali metal nitrates or<br>
alkaline earth metal nitrates, optionally with minor proportions of other salts e.g.C7 to C21and<br>
typically contains 40% to 70% by weight ammonium nitrate and 20% of other nitrates. The internal<br>
oxidiser phase is typically at least 75% more usually more than 90% e.g. about 95%, by volume of<br>
the emulsion explosive. For use, emulsion explosives typically also include additives to sensitise<br>
the compositions to detonation. Commonly this is done by adding materials that provide solid<br>
surfaces e.g. solid C7 to C21, especially as prills, or gas filled voids e.g. by including sodium nitrite,<br>
which produces gas by chemical reaction, or glass microspheres, which provide physical voids.<br>
The compounds of the invention particularly of the formula (I) can be used as emulsifiers alone or<br>
in combination with other typically oil soluble emulsifiers particularly sorbitan fatty acid esters such<br>
as sorbitan mono oleate (SMO); phospholipids such as soyalecithin or oxazoline or imidazoline<br>
derivatives thereof; PIBSA alkanolamine reaction products; or fatty acid condensation products with<br>
polyethylene glycols. The total amount of emulsifier used in emulsion explosives is typically from<br>
0.5 to 5%, more usually from 1 to 4%, by weight based on the overall emulsion. Desirably, the<br>
proportion of emulsifier of the formula (I) is at least 50%, more usually at least 75%, by weight of<br>
the total emulsifier used in the emulsion explosive.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used as water in oil dispersants and/or emulsifiers in<br>
personal care and cosmetic applications, in particular, in formulations including relatively high<br>
concentrations of solutes in a dispersed hydrophilic phase and in the manufacture of multiple<br>
emulsions. The oil phase used in this aspect of the invention is typically an emollient oil which may<br>
be liquid or solid at ambient temperature.<br>
The discontinuous, usually aqueous, phase can be water or a water based liquid, or a hydrophile<br>
phase which can be a solution in water of the hydrophilic material or the discontinuous phase can,<br>
in certain cases, be a substantially water free liquid phase of the hydrophilic material. In such<br>
systems the surfactant of the invention is typically used in an amount of 0.5 to 5%, more usually<br>
from 1 to 2%, by weight of the total emulsion.<br>
The surfactants of this invention can be used as emulsifiers and/or dispersants in agrochemical<br>
applications. The invention accordingly includes an agrochemical emulsion or dispersion, in which<br>
at least one surfactant compound of the invention, particularly of the formula (I), is included as an<br>
emulsifier or dispersant. Within this, more particularly the invention includes:<br>
i an agrochemical emulsion including an agrochemically active material which is dissolved,<br>
dispersed or emulsified in a first liquid component, the first liquid component being emulsified<br>
in a second liquid component;<br>
ii an agrochemical formulation including an agrochemically active material which is dissolved,<br>
dispersed or emulsified in a first liquid component, a second liquid component being<br>
emulsified in the first liquid component;<br>
iii an agrochemical dispersion in which a solid component is dispersed in a liquid phase.<br>
The agrochemically active material(s) included in the emulsions and/or dispersions in this aspect of<br>
the invention can include one or more plant growth regulators, herbicides, and/or pesticides, for<br>
example insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, nematocides, miticides, rodenticides, bactericides,<br>
molluscicides and bird repellants. Examples of classes of actives include: Herbicides: including<br>
water soluble, particularly non-selective, herbicides, particularly /V-phosphonomethyl glycine<br>
herbicides e.g. Glyphosate and Sulfosate, and the glufosinate and bipyridyl types of non-selective<br>
herbicides, triazines, substituted ureas, sulphonyl ureas, pyridine carboxylic acids, aryloxy alkanoic<br>
acids, 2-(4-aryloxy-phenoxy)propionic acids, bis-carbamates; Fungicides: including<br>
thiocarbamates, particularly alkylenebis(dithiocarbamate)s, strobilurins, dicarboximides,<br>
benzimidazoles, azoles, inorganic fungicides; Insecticides including benzoyl ureas; and Acaricides<br>
including tetrazines.<br>
Particular applications of the polymeric surfactants of the invention in agrochemicals include:<br>
Concentrated emulsions which contain both aqueous and non-aqueous phases with the continuous<br>
phase usually being aqueous.<br>
Oil in water agrochemical emulsions are generally non-transparent white emulsions which are<br>
applied after further dilution in the spray tank.<br>
Water in oil emulsions which are generally non-transparent (white) emulsions and are typically<br>
commercialised as ready to use formulations, ultra low volume systems, and other specialty<br>
applications.<br>
Dispersions, in an aqueous or oil based liquid, of solid components which commonly will be<br>
insoluble actives, particularly fungicides or herbicides, but may be non-agrochemically active<br>
insoluble solid components.<br>
Suspoemulsions which are systems in which at least one liquid and at least one solid disperse<br>
phase is included in a continuous phase, which is usually aqueous.<br>
Combination formulations, particularly concentrated dispersions in which the compounds of the<br>
formula (I) can be used as dispersants in formulations which combine agrochemicals having<br>
different physical forms or presentations in formulation and/or different activities.<br>
In agrochemical compositions, the surfactants of the invention, particularly of the formula (I), can<br>
be used alone or in combination with other polymeric surfactants, but desirably, the proportion of<br>
surfactant of the invention , particularly of the formula (I), is at least 50%, more usually at least<br>
75%, by weight of the total polymeric surfactant used as emulsifier and/or stabiliser and/or<br>
dispersant in the composition.<br>
One area of practical importance in this aspect of the invention is sunfilters and sunscreens or<br>
other cosmetics containing sunfilter and/or sunscreen components. The sunfilters or sunscreens<br>
can be physical sunscreens such as those based on titanium dioxide e.g. ultra-fine titanium<br>
dioxide, or zinc oxide, which are understood to act by strongly scattering ultraviolet radiation, or<br>
chemical sunfilters or sunscreens such as compounds that absorb ultraviolet radiation, particularly<br>
UVB and UVA sunscreen agents. The amount of sunfilters and/or sunscreen used will depend on<br>
the properties of the materials used, but typically for physical sunscreens the amount will be 0.1 %<br>
to 5%, more usually from 0.25 to 2.5%, by weight of the overall emulsion and for chemical sunfilters<br>
and/or sunscreens 0.05 to 3%, more usually from 0.1 to 1.5%, by weight of the overall emulsion.<br>
Depending on their nature the sunfilter and sunscreen components may be present in the generally<br>
aqueous discontinuous phase or in the oil continuous phase or in both phases. Particularly where<br>
the sunscreens is a physical sunscreen, the overall emulsion will be combined suspension and<br>
emulsion and these are commonly referred to as suspoemulsions (see further below).<br>
Suspoemulsions are a further important area in this aspect of the invention. They are briefly<br>
referred to above in connection with sunscreens, but other solid components can be included such<br>
as pigments as are often included in make up cosmetics. When pigments are used, they may be<br>
pigments organic or inorganic and may be present in the oil phase, particularly for organic<br>
pigments and hydrophobic inorganic pigments, or in the present in the water phase, particularly for<br>
hydrophilic inorganic pigments, or in both phases, when used are typically present in<br>
concentrations of from 0.5 to 20% more usually from 1 to 10%, by weight of the emulsion. ,<br>
Generally the amount of the compound of the formula (I) used in cosmetic compositions of this<br>
aspect of the invention is from 0.5 to 7%, more usually from 1 to 5%, by weight of the formulation.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) can be used alone or in combination with other polymeric<br>
emulsifiers, but desirably, the proportion of the compound of the formula (I) is at least 50%, more<br>
usually at least 75%, by weight of the total emulsifier used in stabilising the cosmetic emulsion.<br>
The surfactant compounds of the invention may also be used as demulsifiers in oilfield<br>
applications. Demulsifiers are typically used to aid separation of water emulsified in the<br>
hydrocarbon phase of oils. In use as demulsifiers, the amount of surfactant used as a demulsifier<br>
will typically be from 1 to 500 ppm, particularly from 5 to 150 ppm, by weight of the oil stream.<br>
The surfactant compounds of the invention may also be used as emulsifiers and/or lubricants in<br>
metal working applications particularly in rolling oil emulsions and cutting fluids.<br>
The compounds of the invention can further be used as dispersants finely divided solids in nonaqueous<br>
fluids, particularly liquid organic media. Examples of such materials include pigments,<br>
particularly for paints and solvent inks; dyes including disperse dyes; magnetic metal oxides;<br>
extenders and fillers; optical brightening agents; and textile auxiliaries; solids for oil based and<br>
invert emulsion drilling muds; dirt and solid particles in dry cleaning fluids; and magnetic materials<br>
for magnetic recording media. The medium is typically an oil such as a hydrocarbon or A natural or<br>
synthetic ester oil, or a coating composition resin such as an alkyd resin, or special mixture of<br>
glycols typically used in the preparation of multi-purpose pigment pastes or pigment concentrates.<br>
Such dispersions typically contain from 5 to 95%, more usually from 10 to 60%, and especially from<br>
20 to 50%, by weight of the solid, depending on the nature of the solid and the relative densities.<br>
The dispersion may be made by conventional method for making dispersions.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless<br>
otherwise stated.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Acid Value (AV) was measured by the method of ASTM D1980-87.<br>
Emulsion Stability ,<br>
Oil in water emulsions (1 %w/w emulsifier, 20% w/w oil) were prepared by weighing 158 g of<br>
demineralised water into a 400 ml tall form beaker, adding 2 g of test emulsifier and stirring the<br>
mixture using a magnetic flea and hotplate/stirrer at room temperature until completely dissolved.<br>
40 g of Oil 1 were then added to the aqueous solution and the mixture homogenised using an Ultra<br>
Turrax T25 blender at 11000 rpm (ca 183 Hz) for 2 mins. The resultant emulsion was transferred<br>
to two 50 ml volumetric cylinders, one of which was stored at room temperature (Amb) and the<br>
other in a hotbox at 50Â°C. The emulsion mean droplet size (in urn) of the stored samples was<br>
measured using a Coulter Multisizer II after 1 day (1D), 1 week (1W), and 1 month (1M).<br>
Synthesis Examples<br>
Example SE1 - Poly(sorbitol adipate) laurate<br>
Anhydrous sorbitol (182 g; 1 mol), adipic acid (87.6 g; 0.6 mol) and potassium carbonate (9.66 g;<br>
7 mol% based on sorbitol) were charged to a 250 ml rourjd bottomed flask fitted with a propeller<br>
stirrer, side-arm water condenser and collection flask, vacuum pump, nitrogen sparge and<br>
thermometer (thermocouple) and on an isomantle. The mixture was heated under stirring (200<br>
rpm) to distil off free water (mostly at below 130Â°C); vacuum (100 mbar) was then applied and the<br>
temperature was increased to 170Â°C and held until the acid value of the mix was 
(normally 3 to 4 hrs). The vacuum was then released and molten lauric acid (30.1 g; 0.15 mol) at<br>
ca. 90Â°C was added. Vacuum (500 mbar) was re-applied and the mix stirred (300 rpm) with the<br>
nitrogen sparge until the acid value was 
the vacuum was then released and the product discharged.<br>
The structure of the product was confirmed using MALDI mass spectrometry and gel permeation<br>
chromatography.<br>
Further esters of oligopolyol esters were made by the general method set out in Example SE1 but<br>
making changes to the starting materials, material proportions or conditions. Table 1a below<br>
(including SE1 for completeness) sets out the diacid and other materials used and reaction<br>
conditions for the oligomerisation esterification and Table 1b the monoacid and reaction conditions<br>
for the second stage esterification together with some information on the properties of the products<br>
made. In these tables, the molar % figures are based on the polyol used.<br>
In making these compounds variations of the synthetic route described in Example SE1 were also<br>
used. In particular anhydrous sorbitol could be substituted for the aqueous sorbitol used in SE1<br>
and for materials including succinic acid residues succinic anhydride could be used instead of<br>
succinic acid e.g. using the following procedure:<br>
200 g anhydrous sorbitol (1.10 mol), 65.9 g (0.66 mol) succinic anhydride and 11.5 g (7.5 mol%<br>
based on sorbitol) potassium carbonate were charged to a 500 ml round bottomed flask equipped<br>
as in SE1. The mixture was heated under stirring (200 rpm) to 140Â°C. After SOmins at this<br>
temperature, a sample was taken for FT-IR analysis (to confirm the absence of anhydride). The<br>
temperature was increased to 165Â°C and a vacuum (100 mbar) was applied. The reaction was<br>
maintained under these conditions until the acid value of the reaction mix was 
(normally 3 to 4 hrs). The vacuum was released and the product discharged.<br>
Using these methods the products were very similar to corresponding compounds made using the<br>
method of SE1.<br>
