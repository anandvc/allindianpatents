Preferably, the diluent is lactose, e.g., lactose 200 mesh (e.g., from DMV® or Alpavit ®), e.g., the monohydrated form.<br><br><br>
Other excipients disclosed in the literature, as for instance in Fiedler's "Lexicon der Hilfstoffe", 4th Edition, ECV Aulendorf 1996 and "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients" Wade and Weller Ed.(1994), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention.<br>
The invention is particularly useful for pharmaceutical compositions containing an active agent, e.g., an 5HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., compound A, e.g., the hydrogen maleate salt, which is present in an amount within the range of from about 0.2% to about 20%, e.g. 0.5 to 15%, and preferably from about 1% to about 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
A preferred composition of the invention may comprise from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight of active agent, e.g., a 5HT4 receptor agonist, e.g., compound A, e.g., the hydrogen maleate salt, from 20 to 60% by weight of disintegrant, e.g., crospovidone, from 1 to about 20% by weight of a lubricant, e.g., monoglycerylstearate, from 0.1 to about 10% by weight of a surfactant, e.g., poloxalkol, from about 10 to 50% by weight of a diluent, e.g., lactose, and from 1 to 10% by weight of a binder, e.g., hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (e.g. HPMC-3). From 1 to 10% by weight of PEG may also be added.<br>
The weight ratio of the active agent to the disintegrant may be from 1:1 to 1:400, e.g., 1:5 to 1:100,1:8 to 1:50, e.g., 1:16 to 1:20.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical oral, e.g., tablet, composition comprising one of the active agents cited above, e.g., a 5-HT4 agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Tegaserod, said composition having dissolution characteristics in water or in USP buffers pH 6.8 and 7.5 of:<br><br><br><br>
For example a composition according to the invention, e.g., comprising Tegaserod as the active agent, may have dissolution characteristics in water or in USP buffers pH 6.8 and 7.5 of: <br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical oral, e.g., tablet, composition comprising one of the active agents cited above, e.g., a 5-HT4 agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Tegaserod, wherein in use 80% of said active agent is released in water or in USP buffers pH 6.8 and 7.5 within 5 minutes.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of at least 15% by weight of a disintegrant in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical composition for the administration of an acid sensitive and/or poorly soluble, e.g., in aqueous media, active agent, e.g., a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, e.g., compound A, e.g. the hydrogen maieate salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful in the known indications of the particular active agent incorporated therein.<br>
The exact amounts of active agent and of the formulation to be administered depend on a number of factors, e.g. the condition to be treated, the desired duration of treatment and the rate of release of active agent.<br>
For example, the amount of the active agent required and the release rate thereof may be determined on the basis of conventional in vitro or in vivo techniques, determining how long a particular active agent concentration in the blood plasma remains at an acceptable level for a therapeutic effect<br><br>
Examples of doses provided in a solid formulation, e.g., a tablet, are, for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), 1 mg to 12 mg of active agent, for functional dyspepsia (FD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 0.2 to 2mg of active agent, in particular compound A, e.g. the hydrogen maleate salt, per day for a 70 kilogram mammal, e.g. humans, and in standard animal models. The increased tolerability of the active agent, in particular compound A, e.g. the hydrogen maleate salt, provided by the compositions may be observed in standard animal tests and in clinical trials.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprising a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist is particularly useful for improving sensory perception of rectal distension, e.g. for the treatment of anal incontinence, or for preventing, modulating or treating visceral pain or discomfort.<br>
5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, e.g. as disclosed in EP-A1-505,322, on the basis of observed activity, e.g. stimulatory effect on the peristaltic reflex in the isolated guinea-pig ileum, e.g. as described in EP-A1-505,322, have been found to be useful for the treatment of gastro-intestinal motility disorders, for example to normalise or to improve the gastric emptying and intestinal transit in subjects having a disturbed motility, e.g. in irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has now surprisingly been found that 5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists have a beneficial effect, e.g. they exert modulating effects, on the sensory perception of rectal distension and on visceral sensitivity or perception.<br>
It is admitted that receptor properties are not uniform throughout the gut and that the type of afferent innervation reflects the quality of sensations originating from a particular organ. For example, the rectum belongs to those parts of the gastro-intestinal tract from which also non-painful sensations arise, in contrast to the colon from which only painful sensations emanate.<br>
r<br>
Anal incontinence may be due to functional disturbances of the main anal continence mechanisms.   Anal continence appears to be based on a co-ordinated functioning of the<br><br>
neuromuscular machinery managing rectal sensation and compliance, the recto-anal inhibitory reflex, reflex contractions of the external anal sphincter and the puborectalis muscle. Although skeletal muscle (external sphincter and puborectalis) contractions are of great importance in the maintenance of continence, it is probably the triggering effect of rectal sensation and perception that plays a crucial role and, in fact, is frequently abnormal in incontinent patients. Anal incontinence is a dysfunction which occurs particularly in diabetics and the elderly population.<br>
There is a medical need for modulating visceral sensitivity, discomfort or pain in patients suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders and for a treatment of anal continence dysfunctions.<br>
In accordance with the particular findings of the present invention, there is provided:<br>
1.1.	A method for preventing, modulating or treating visceral, e.g. abdominal, pain or discomfort in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
1.2.	A method for modulating visceral sensitivity or perception in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
1.3.	A method for stimulating 5-HT4 receptors present on afferent nerve terminals, particularly on extrinsic neurones of the gut, in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
1.4.	A method for modulating visceral sensitivity, discomfort or pain via stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors present on afferent nerve terminals, particularly on extrinsic neurones of the gut, in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
1.5.	A method for regulating or stabilising myenteric plexus-afferent fibbers in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
1.6.	A method for improving sensory perception of rectal distension in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
1.7.	A method for treating anal continence dysfunctions in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
As alternative to the above the present invention also provides:<br>
2.	A 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or .antagonist or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof for use in a method as defined under 1.1 to 1.7 above; or<br>
3.	A 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for use in a method as defined under 1.1 to 1.7 above; or<br>
4.	A pharmaceutical composition for use in a method as defined under 1.1 to 1.7 above<br>
comprising   a   5-HT4   receptor   agonist,   partial   agonist   or   antagonist   or   a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
» acceptable diluents or carriers therefor,  e.g.  a  composition  such  as disclosed<br>
hereinabove.<br>
Preferred compounds for use in accordance with the invention include e.g. those listed hereinabove, particularly 5-HT4 receptor full agonists or partial agonists, e.g. (S)-zacopride, cisapride, prucalopride, SB 205149, SC 53116, RS 67333, RS 67506, BIMU1, BIMU 8, (S)-RS 56532, especially Compound A and particularly its hydrogen maleate salt, more<br><br>
prererably selecuve b-M14 receptor agonists or partial agonists, and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, e.g. Tropisetron, GR 113808, GR 125487, SB 204070, SB 207266, RS 23597, RS 39604, RS 100235, DAU 6285, SC 53606, 3-(5-hydroxy-7-methyl-1H-indoi-3"y!-methylene)-N-pentyl-N-methyl-carbazimidamide etc. By selective is meant a compound which does not substantially bind to or stimulate the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. A group of compounds excludes Tropisetron.<br>
Utility of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist in the prevention, modulation or treatment of visceral, e.g., abdominal pain or discomfort or modulation of visceral sensitivity or perception or regulation or stabilisation of myenteric plexus-afferent fibers, is demonstrated in convenient tests, e.g., in accordance with the method hereinafter described.<br>
Decerebrate, anaesthesia-free cats under continuous monitoring of blood pressure are paralysed by alcuronium chloride dissolved in rheomacrodex i.v. (200 |ig/kg initially and supplementary doses of 100 |ig/kg, if necessary), and artificially ventilated. Single unit activity of afferent fibres are recorded in a monopolar fashion from peripheral endings of centrally cut filaments of sacral dorsal roots. Tension receptors are identified by probing of their receptive fields in the wall of the mobilised rectum. Thereafter, the response of the units to barostat -controlled rectal ramp-distension is determined. The quantitative response characteristics of the units is evaluated with respect to distension pressure and resulting rectal diameter. Alternatively, the response of the units to pressure-induced peristalsis is measured.<br>
After obtaining 2 distension profiles (5 min each) and/or 10 min of peristalsis under control conditions, a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound A, or vehicle is applied i.v. and tfie protocol is repeated. Subsequently, the activity of additional units is recorded in the presence of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound A, or vehicle according to the distension/peristalsis protocol. In this assay, the firing rate of the rectal afferents is reduced after administration of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist at a dose range of from 0.1 to 3 mg/kg i.v., at distension pressures above 20 mmHg. With Compound A, administered i.v. in incremental doses from 0.15 to 1.2<br><br>
mg/kg, the most prominent inhibition occurs at 50 mmHg and a half-maximal reduction is obtained at about 0.7 mg/kg.<br>
Utility of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound A, in the treatment of anal incontinence as well as utility in treating conditions as hereinabove specified, may be demonstrated in accordance with the method hereinafter described.<br>
Intraluminal pressures and reflexes in the last 60 cm of the colon of 10 fasted healthy volunteers are measured by means of perfusion manometry. Three latex balloons positioned at 50, 30 and 10 cm, allow volume stimulation. Basal values of colonic intraluminal pressures and reflexes are established. Subsequently, reflex inhibitory relaxations of the internal anal sphincter is triggered by inflating the balloons by 10 ml increments up to a maximum volume of 150 ml. During the inflation phase, two parameters are evaluated: a) the reflux threshold (volume able to induce a substantial" pressure decrease of the internal anal sphincter); and b) the sensation threshold (volume able to induce a conscious defecation reflex). After the basal recordings, each subject is given a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound Ar p.o. and 30 to 90 min later the colonic intraluminal pressure and reflexes are assessed again by the same method. In this test, the 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound A, significantly reduced the sensation threshold when administered at a dose of 2-12 mg p.o.<br>
5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, e.g., Compound A, may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, e.g., in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, e.g., in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions or in a suppository form.<br>
5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, e.g., Compound A, may be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically salt form. Such salts exhibit the same order of activity as the 5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists in free form.<br>
Daily dosages required in practising the method of the present invention will vary depending upon, for example, the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the<br><br>
severity of the condition to be treated. An indicated daily dose is in the range of from about 0.05 to about 30 mg, e.g., from about 0.05 to about 5 mg for parenteral use, and of from about 0.1 to about 30 mg for oral use, conveniently administered once or in divided dosages 2 to 4x/day, or in sustained release form. Unit dosage forms for oral administration accordingly comprise from about 0.5 to about 30 mg of 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound A, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, admixed with an appropriate solid or liquid, pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
Furthermore, it has also been found that a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist-e.g., Compound A, have a beneficial effect in the prevention or treatment of gastro-intestinal motility disorders, e.g. a stimulatory effect on gastrointestinal motility, in horses and cattle.<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided: -<br>

7. A pharmaceutical composition for veterinary use, e.g. in horses or cattle, e.g. in any of the method 5.1. or 5.2. as indicated above, comprising a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist, e.g., Compound A, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor, e.g. a composition as disclosed hereinabove.<br>
Preferred 5-HT4 receptor agonists or partial agonists for use in horses or cattle in accordance with the invention include e.g. those listed hereinabove, e.g. (S)-zacopride, prucalopride, SB 205149, SC 53116, RS 67333, RS 67506, BIMU 1, BIMU 8, (S)-RS 56532, especially Compound A and particularly its hydrogen maleate salt, more preferably a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist.<br>
Utility of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist, e.g., Compound A, in the treatment of post-operative Ileus as well as utility in treating conditions as hereinabove specified in horses or cattle, may be demonstrated in accordance with the method hereinafter described.<br>
20 horses having colic syndrome are submitted to abdominal surgery. During surgery supportive therapy is applied to them. At the end of surgery, a specific 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist, e.g., Compound A, is administered i.v. or i.m., e.g. at a dose of from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg. This dose is repeated every 8 to 24 h until spontaneous defecation is observed. Gastro-intestinal motility is evaluated based e.g. on the presence or absence of gastric reflux as determined by nasogastric intubation, occurrence of borborygmi and timing of defecation after the first injection of the test compound. In this test, the compounds tested, e.g. Compound A, are effective in restoring normal motility function of the equine intestine.<br>
Daily dosages required in practising the veterinary method of the present invention will vary depending upon, for example, the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition to be treated. An indicated daily dose is in the range of from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg, e.g., from about 0.05 to about 5 mg/kg for parenteral use, conveniently administered once or in divided dosages 2 to 4x/dayf or in sustained release form.<br><br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a method for preventing or treating gastrointestinal motility disorders in a subject, e.g., a human or an animal, in need of such a therapy comprising administering to this subject an effective amount of a composition according to the present invention.<br>
In a further aspect the invention a process is provided for improving dissolution properties in aqueous media of a pharmaceutical composition containing an acid sensitive and/or poorly soluble in aqueous media active agent, e.g., a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, more particularly compound A, e.g. the hydrogen maleate salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared by any conventional method known in the art, e.g., by mixing an appropriate amount of the active agent, e.g., a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, with at least 15%, e.g., from 20 to 60%, e.g., from 30 to 50%, e.g., 40%, by weight of a disintegrant based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
It is preferred to formulate in solid form, e.g., unit dosage form. Typical form include capsules and preferably compressed forms such as tablets.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention may be prepared by e.g., a wet, e.g., water based, granulation manufacturing process (the process equipment, as glass material, may be pre-treated with a siliconizing agent) comprising the successive steps of:<br>
i) pre-mixing the acid sensitive and/or poorly soluble in water active agent, e.g., a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, e.g., compound A, e.g. the hydrogen maleate salt with 60 to 98% of the diluent, and then sieving the resulting mixture,<br>
ii) mixing purified water with the binder in a weight ratio of from 1:20 to 3:20, and stirring until dissolution,<br>
iii) adding the surfactant to the solution of ii) and stirring until dissolution,<br>
iv) adding the disintegrant, the remaining diluent and 50 to 70% of the first lubricant to the pre mixture of i) and mixing<br>
v) wetting the mixture of step iv) with the granulating solution from step iii) while mixing<br><br>
vi) granulating the mixture of step v) by mixing,<br>
vii) drying the granulate to reach a required loss on drying, e.g., for the tabletting mixture<br>
viii) sizing the granulate by sieving.<br>
For tablet manufacturing the granulate from viii) is mixed, e.g., in a free fall mixer, with the rest of the first lubricant and the second one to obtain the desired final tabletting mixture which may be compressed into tablets. This may be performed with conventional tabletting machines on, e.g., a rotary machine, at compression pressures of, e.g., 2 to 30 KN, e.g. 5 to 27 KN, e.g., 10 to 20 KN (KN = Kilo Newtons).<br>
The composition according to the invention may also be prepared by an alternative wet granulation manufacturing process wherein the pre-mixing and sieving of step i) are not performed. In this case, the active agent, the disintegrant, the diluent and about 60% of the first lubricant are pre-blended together and then wetted with the wetting solution of step iv).<br>
Compositions comprising any of the above-mentioned active agents may be prepared by a process as disclosed above.<br>
If desired the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are stored under low relative humidity conditions, e.g., rH (relative humidity) less than 50%, e.g., below e.g. 30-50%, and at room temperature, preferably less than 20°C. The compositions provide storage stable systems. Insignificant degradation is detected after storage of up to 1 year at room temperature, e.g., 25 °C.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be packed in conventional manner to keep out<br>
humidity, e.g., in a blister pack, optionally with a desiccant.<br>
•<br>
The compositions of the invention may have a water content of from 0 to 3% based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
