				<td> <br><br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System for Liquid Conveyance functions as independent dynamic storage, treatment, distribution unit for the disposals of corrosive effluents and water through pipe lines at the ground level, further higher pressure delivery pipe flow increased by operating the attached Portable PVC Hand Pump, saving Motor Pump Costs and Power. Manufactured out of flexible non-corrosive materials and lightweight detachable components, Flexible Pressure Bag Container System can be easily assembled and dismantled, ensuring rapid mobility and transportation.<br>
Flexible Pressure Bag Container System functions as enclosed system during working, storing the disposal effluents in dynamic state, ensures smooth flow when released and distribute to the delivery pipelines under increased pressure, higher delivery pressure further ensured by operating the attached Portable Hand Pump. In the prior specification, Rigid Open Containers used, stores effluents in the static state, and has gravity constraints for free flow through the pipelines at the ground level. Motor Pump is required for increased pressure outflow to the delivery pipelines.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System can be used as Waste Water treatment Equipment for the treatment and disposals of corrosive effluents as single system. Chemicals, Acids, or Diluents can be added and agitated in this simple system, without incurring costs of additional equipment. Hand Pump Constituent of this System, accomplishes the higher pressure required for the delivery flow to pass through the pressure filter for required filtration standards. Residual filtrate can be disposed of and the System can be cleaned easily.<br>
In the prior specification, separate non-corrosive lined Tanks are required for both storage and mixing. Non-corrosive Chemical Pump is required to operate, without which the delivery flow will not pass through the pressure filter, due to gravity constraints, adding capital costs further.<br>
Because of its flexible top and bottom characteristics, Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag System can be used as single junction point collection system for liquid disposals, using multi-inlet adapter connections. Multi-outlet adapter connection can be easily fitted, at the outlet of the flexible wall bottom to draw distribution lines for four sides distribution without operational problems.<br>
There is no suitable equipment of prior specification for comparison. It is difficult to draw delivery pipelines from the rigid bottom of Rigid Container Tanks. Leakage problems will occur unless well laid foundation is in place.<br>
Energy efficient and effective disposals are possible with Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System, when used in Motor Pumping schemes. Instead of using higher HP ratings, the System works with smaller HP ratings for the same lengths of disposals. The System can also be used as buffer equipment converting high volume water with lower pressure head, to low volume water with higher-pressure head for specific applications. The System can be used as pressure boosting device, fixing the equipment online, distance away from the Pumping Installation, toward tail end.<br><br>
In the current specification, only smaller HP ratings pumps are provided with rigid pressure booster tank of smaller capacity, which fits just at the outlet of the Motor Pump. This kind of pressure booster is not available to pumps of higher HP ratings. The effectiveness of this equipment is available only to smaller volume circuits. Present Pumping layouts, using higher HP rating Pumps, suffer head losses towards tail end. No pressure compensation device suitable is available, for higher HP Motor Pumping disposals at present.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag System can be effectively employed in the storage and distribution of water. The System has unique advantage of dynamic storage and better pressure distribution, further compensating pressure available by manually operating the Portable Hand Pump. Hence Motor Pump or Power is not at all required for its functioning at the ground level. There is no need to install the System at elevated heights to overcome gravity constraints. The System, being capable of rapid assembly and dismantling, can be easily transported from locations to locations. The System can be installed at inaccessible locations and undulating terrains with flexible pipelines for distribution and disposals. As water can be filled manually in this System, the installation of the System can be independent from the location of water source.<br>
In the current specification, Rigid Plastic Tank or Steel Tank is used for storage and distribution purpose. The Tanks are generally installed at fixed locations with rigid pipelines using Motor Pump. Water source has to be near the installation. For better pressure flow, the Tank has to be placed at elevated platform incurring additional costs. Tanks cannot be installed at undulating terrains or inaccessible locations. It is not easily transportable from locations to locations, as desired.<br>
Being flexible, offering rapid mobility and easy transportation, Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System can be used as intermediate storage and distribution for inaccessible areas like Firefighting operations in forests, effectively used along with Diesel Engine Pumps, for extra lengths operations using flexible pipelines and hoses.<br>
No Rigid System of Storage and Distribution equipment, of current specification can be as easily transportable and installed at hostile and inaccessible locations rapidly, as desired.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System can be used as enclosed single system<br>
ground level collection of roof top rainwater harvesting using multi port inlet<br>
connections fixed at the Inlet of the System. The water so collected could be pressure<br>
recharged to the bore wells after filtration, using Portable Hand Pump for better<br>
penetration recharge.<br>
No current specification of similar equipment is available for distinguishing this<br>
feature.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System can be used as independent storage and higher-pressure distribution of water in Drip Irrigation. Water is manually filled in the Container, Inlet is then closed, Portable Hand Pump Operated for higher delivery pressure at the terminals. Flexible layout is possible for small farms, which can be dismantled and relocated when necessary. The System can function in undulating terrains with flexible pipelines and microtubings. Water source is not required at the installation site, as it can be procured and filled from elsewhere. The System is cost effective and affordable for small farm holdings.<br><br>
Current Drip Irrigation practice is useful and affordable only to larger farm holdings because of higher costs of installation. Water source has to be at site of the installations Irrigation layout is designed on leveled terrain, which cannot be dismantled or relocated. Motor Pump and Power required pumping water into this<br>
System.<br>
Smaller storage capacities of Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System can function as flexible pressure flow filling equipment for Washing Machines, where water pressure drop and water scarcity does not allow adequate inlet pressure water flow for Washing Machines, to operate and function smoothly. Outlet of the Container is connected to the Inlet of the Washing Machine. Water is filled in the Container manually, and Inlet then closed after filling and pressure water delivery flow maintained by using the Portable Hand Pump as when required. Excess water after the duty cycle is drained out and the System is then dismantled and packed, after use.<br>
No current specification of similar equipment is available, for distinguishing this feature.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System for Liquid Conveyance consists of collapsible Bag manufactured out of flexible polyester or nylon yarn fabric reinforced, PVC coated sheets and attached Portable PVC Hand Pump. The cut sheets to form the walls, top base and bottom base of the Container are then bonded with sheet strips using flexible polymer adhesives. Shape of the Bag is made in the shape of Trapezoid, cannot stand on its own without any structural support. The Bag Container has two closable threaded Inlet connections at the top base and one Outlet at the center bottom base. One of the two inlets is used for filling the effluent. Outlet is provided at the centre of the flexible bottom of the Bag Container, lying buried, beneath the Bag Assembly installation. Delivery pipes for liquid disposals, is drawn from this Outlet<br>
The Collapsible Bag Container can attain its shape only with the help of Steel Pieces Structural Supports. The Steel Pieces Structural Assembly encloses the Bag from all the four sides. Single Steel pieces with drilled holes are fastened with Bolts and Nuts, assembled together on the sides of the Bag .Top end frames of the Steel Supports hold the Bag Container, upright inserted through its sleeves provided at the top of the Container.<br>
The other component of the Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System the specially made Portable PVC Hand Pump is connected to the other Inlet of the Bag. The Hand Pump is connected to the Inlet of the Bag through a flexible tube and a nonreturn valve.<br>
The Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System becomes enclosed when both the Inlets are closed before starting the operation when necessary connections are fixed on the Container. The delivery pipelines are drawn from the Outlet, beneath the installation.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System, assembled with Steel Supports and the Portable Hand Pump connected along with, is installed on slightly raised mud filled or sand base, ground level, to accommodate the delivery pipe line layout connected to the center ground flexible bottom base outlet of the Bag .The delivery pipe lines, lies connected and buried under the installation.<br><br>
The liquid is filled through the Inlet of the Bag Container. Air trapped inside the Bag acts on the rising liquid level inside the Bag Container, increasing the outlet pressure, to flow through the delivery pipelines. The Hand Pump is then manually operated to increase the out flow pressure. The excess pressure is released through the relief valves attached and connected if necessary.<br>
When the Bag Container is to be used for Storage and Distribution of effluents and water, the Bag Container act as prime storage and delivery equipment. The liquid filling in the Bag is done by manual filling, operating the system, only when needed. Stopper valves can be provided at the delivery side to contain the influent storage volume. Outlet valve is opened when the Bag is filled. Hand pump is operated to raise the outflow pressure. The delivery pressure is maintained till full disposal and distribution is over.<br>
. The Portable PVC Hand Pump is used for manually operating the Flexible Bag Container for higher liquid outflow pressure. Hand Pump is employed, to work the system, independent of Motor Pump. The Hand Pump can deliver higher output pressure. It is lightweight, and portable, fitted and attached along with the Bag Container wherever it is installed. The Hand Pump specially made for this System is for the hydraulic purpose of pressure liquid conveyance, which made out of PVC materials, which can give higher output and longer life.<br>
The Hand Pump, presently available is only used in small applications of commercial uses, like pneumatic applications. They are made of corrodible Steel shell parts, which cannot last longer. They can only supply small air output.<br>
Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System can be used in Motor Pumping Schemes also. The System is installed at the delivery side of the pipelines of the Pump. The Main Inlet of the Bag Container is connected to the delivery pipeline of the Pump. The System can be installed on any location online, distance away from the pump, till the point where lesser head flow to the Bag Container installation is available.<br>
The Invention describes the development of novel functional Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System for dynamic storage and higher pressure flow; used in liquid conveyance applications. The System is developed to cater custom requirements for different end uses and disposals. Manual operation is employed, to enable the system to work independently without the use of Power and Motor Pump.<br>
The Drawings attached along with this specification, explain the Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System. The Sheet No.l shows the Flexible Plastic Bag Container assembled and raised on Steel Pieces Supports, inserted through its sleeves. The Sheet No.2 shows the Portable PVC Hand Pump, to be used along with the Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container Assembly. The Flow diagram of the System, when used in Pumping System is shown in Sheet No.3 .The "WELL" shown in this sheet represent, the reservoir source/pipeline liquid source, from where the Inlet of the Bag is connected. The Bag Assembly is shown as placed on the mud/sand platform. The Flow diagram of the System, for Manual Operation is shown in the Sheet NoAThe Bag Container Assembly is placed on ground level mud/sand platform.<br><br>
Flexible Plastic Bag Container is manufactured out of flexible PVC coated sheets with nylon or polyester yarn fabric reinforcement. Flexible sheets are cut to the required measurements to hold the required liquid storage capacity. The flexible sheets form the walls, top base, and bottom base of the Bag Container. Two threaded Inlet connections are provided and fixed by structural polymer adhesive in the sheet, meant for the flexible top base of the Container. Outlet connection is provided and fixed by the structural polymer adhesive at the centre of the sheet meant for the flexible bottom base of the Container. The Inlet connections and Outlet connections are provided of non-corrosive polypropylene materials. One of the two inlets is for filling operation and the other, for connecting to the Portable PVC Hand Pump tube connection. Alternatively, one of the Inlets connections can invariably be used for fixing pressure relief valve, and additions of chemicals, acids or diluents for effluent treatment purposes. The sheet strips of the same material bonded then by special flexible adhesive, join the cut sheets sides. Insert sleeves are provided alongside at four sides of the top base of the Bag for inserting steel support pieces through it. The Bag when bonded and assembled in this way form the shape of Trapezoid is flexible and collapsible.<br>
Steel support pieces assembly is required for the Bag, as it cannot stand on its own because of its collapsible nature. Support steel pieces are made from Steel angles and flats, cut drilled holes at both ends for fastening with high tensile Steel Bolts and Nuts, for assembling along with other unit pieces. Angle form of the steel supports assembly, supports the corner sidewalls of the Container. Flat form of the steel supports the sides across. Selection and cut lengths of the equal angle steel and flat steel forms required for support purposes, depend on the volume of the liquid storage, to be contained, treated and circulated. The steel support assembly is assembled on the sides of the Bag by fixing and fastening one by one piece process.<br>
The Hand Pump used in this system made out of PVC tubular Shell, is of lightweight and can supply air output about 30 litres per minute to the Bag Container. Steel handle and foot rings made of steel material is provided for manually handling and operating purposes. Higher diameter leather washer employed, is fitted in the steel push rod assembly, for injecting higher air output for higher hydraulic pressure flow. PVC slab forms the base plate. The PVC tube shell and the base plate are plastic wire welded. The outlet of the Hand Pump at the bottom near the base plate is connected to one of the Inlets of the Bag Container, through the flexible tube and a non-return valve.<br>
The system is partly working on the principle of Hydrostatics. The liquid being a dynamic medium takes the shape of the vessel kept in storage. When the liquid is under conveyance or distribution from a dynamically shaped enclosed Container, the local specific weight of the elements of the liquid under the action of applied acceleration shall be more pronounced. In the dynamic state of liquid at the disposal, the shape of the free surface of the liquid under constant acceleration shall be taken as | tan 8 | = a/g, a plane inclined down at "0" along the direction of acceleration of "a'. Isobar in the redistribution of the liquid in the closed container subjected to the constant acceleration "a' is also inclined angle 6. Vertical lowering of the liquid is taken as free fall as there are no forces acting on the base or walls of the container. The liquid so lowered vertically at the gravitational acceleration "g', remains at atmospheric pressure throughout.<br><br>
The Flexible Plastic Pressure Bag Container System functions as enclosed circuit, upon connecting its Inlet and Outlet to the respective pipeline and tube. The trapped air exerts pressure on the rising level of the liquid filling inside the Bag Container. The higher pressure for the outlet delivery flow is accomplished by manually operating the Hand Pump.<br>
The Bag is made of flexible sheets forming the walls, top and bottom bases of the Container. The walls being flexible, the forces acting on it is minimal. Alongside, the gaps of the Steel supports allow enough flexibility for the Container during working. This flexibility keeps the liquid inside the Bag Container, in dynamic state. The liquid filled in the Container is depleted down vertically at gravitational acceleration *g\ because the outlet of the Bag Container is provided at the centre bottom base of the Bag, keeping the liquid at atmospheric pressure throughout. The Bag Container Assembly when installed at the ground level will have the liquid outflow at atmospheric pressure compensating gravity flow constraints. Operating the Hand Pump increases depleting pressure inside the Bag.<br>
As Container is made in the shape of a Trapezoid, depleting volume of liquid in motion inside the Bag is under constant acceleration. Bag Containers of required storage and circulation is manufactured depending on systems and nature of users requirements. Flexible Bag Container is made, storage capacities ranging from 10 Litres to 5000 Litres. The Bag Container can develop safe working pressure of 10 Kgs/sq.cms. Inlet and Outlet threaded connections ranges from Vi inches nominal diameter to 3 inches nominal diameter.<br>
Flexible Bag Container can be easily assembled when required for use. The Flexible Bag Container and Steel Supports Assembly can be detached and dismantled, stored in a safe place when not in use. The System is easily transportable from one location to another.<br>
