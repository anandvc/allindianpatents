The present invention relates to a pre-polymerized catalyst component and a process for the (co)polymerization of ethylene with a catalyst containing the catalyst component.<br>
High-yield catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins and in particular for ethylene are known in the art. They are generally obtained by supporting, on a magnesium dihalide, a titanium compound normally chosen from titanium halides alkoxide and haloalcoholates. Said catalyst components are then used together with an aluminum alkyl compound in the polymerization of ethylene. This kind of catalyst components, and the catalysts obtained therefrom, are largely used in the plants for the (co)polymerization of ethylene both operating in liquid phase (slurry or bulk) and in gas-phase. However, the use of the catalyst components as such is not completely satisfactory. Indeed, due to the high reactivity of the ethylene, the kinetic of the polymerization reaction is very high. As a consequence, the catalyst is subject to a very strong tension during the initial stage of polymerization which can cause the uncontrolled breakage of the catalyst itself. This event is the cause of the formation of fine particles of polymer, which, in turn, leads to low bulk density of the polymer and to operating process difficulties.<br>
In the attempt to solve these problems, the catalyst is pre-polymerized under controlled conditions, so as to obtain pre-polymerized catalysts purposed to have good morphology. In fact, it is believed that after the pre-polymerization, the catalysts increase their resistance in such a way that the tendency to break under polymerization conditions is decreased. As a consequence, also the formation of fine particles would be reduced. In addition, it is hoped that also the bulk density of the final polymers is improved. In principle the catalyst component could be pre-polymerized with any olefin, however, in practice, the non stereospecific catalysts are always pre-polymerized with ethylene. In fact, in the art it is believed that if prochiral a-olefins like propylene would be pre-polymerized with non stereospecific catalyst, the amorphous polymer produced would negatively affect the performance of the catalysts both in terms of activity and morphological properties. The pre-polymerization with ethylene of a non-stereospecific catalyst however does not fully solve the problems mentioned before. In USP 4,325,837 for example, as it is apparent from table 14A and 14B, the use of a non-stereospecific catalyst pre-polymerized with ethylene to an extent of lower than 50% b.w., based on the weight of the total pre-polymerized catalyst, is not always<br><br>
satisfactory because the yields and the morphological properties of the polymer produced with the pre-polymerized catalyst are in certain cases lower than that of the non-pre-polymerized one. In the same patent it is said (column 37 lines 57-60) that the use of a pre-polymerized catalyst is of no advantage with respect to the non pre-polymerized one. In addition to these problems, it must be noted that in view of the very high reactivity of ethylene the pre-polymerization with this monomer can give some difficulties in keeping the mild conditions that are generally used in the pre-polymerization in order to reach the desired properties of the catalyst.<br>
In view of this situation it has now surprisingly been found that by carrying out the pre-polymerization with prochiral monomers it is possible to obtain a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins which is capable to produce polymers with high bulk density, to avoid the problems of formation of fines and that has an activity which is higher than that of the original non pre-polymerized catalyst.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention a pre-polymerized catalyst component for the polymerization of ethylene, optionally in mixtures with olefins CH2~CHR, wherein R is a Cl-C12 alkyl group, characterized by comprising a non-stereospecific solid catalyst component, comprising Ti, Mg and a halogen, which is pre-polymerized with an alpha olefin CH2=CHR1 wherein R is a C1-C8 alkyl group, to such an extent that the amount of the a-olefin pre-polymer is up to lOOg per g of said solid catalyst component.<br>
According to the present invention the term "non-stereospecific solid catalyst component" means a solid catalyst component that gives, under the standard polymerization conditions described below, a propylene homopolymer having an insolubility in xylene at 25Â°C lower than 90% and preferably lower than 85%.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the a-olefin polymer is less than 15 g and more preferably said amount is less than 5 g per g of solid catalyst component. Li the preferred embodiment said amount of the a-olefin polymer is fromJ).8 to 4 g per g of solid catalyst component . Preferably the catalyst component of the present invention comprises a titanium compound and a magnesium dihalide. The magnesium halides, preferably MgCh, in active form used as a support for Ziegler-Natta catalysts, are widely known from the patent literature.Patents USP 4,298,718 and USP 4,495,338 were the first to describe the use of these compounds in Ziegler-Natta catalysis. It is known from these patents that the magnesium dihalides in active<br><br>
form used as support or co-support in components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins are characterized by X-ray spectra in which the most intense diffraction line that appears in the spectrum of the non-active halide is diminished in intensity and is broadened to form a halo.<br>
The preferred titanium compounds used in the catalyst component of the present invention are those of formula Ti(ORn)n-yXy, where Ru is a C1-C20 hydrocarbon group X is halogen, n is the valence of titanium and y is a number between 1 and n. Particularly preferred compounds are TiCL4,TiCL3and Ti-tetraalcoholates or Ti-chloroalcoholates of formula Ti(ORin)aCln-a where n is the valence of titanium, a is a number comprised between 1 and n, and Rm is a Cl-C8 alkyl or aryl group. Preferably R111 is selected from n-butyl, isobutyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-octyl and phenyl.<br>
The titanium compound can be pre-formed, or it is produced in-situ by the reaction of a titanium tetrahalide, in particular TiCU, with alcohols RnOH or with titanium alkoxides having the formula Ti(ORfl)4 where Rn has the meaning defined above.<br>
In the alternative, the titanium tetralkoxides can be caused to react with halogenating compounds such as, for instance, SiCl4, AICI3, chlorosilanes, Al-alkyl halides to form titanium haloalcoholates. In the latter case, the titanium valence is reduced and titanium haloalkoxides are formed wherein the titanium valence is lower than 4.<br>
The preparation of the solid catalyst component can be carried out according to several methods. According to one of these methods, the magnesium dichloride in an anhydrous state and the titanium compound are milled together under conditions in which activation of the magnesium dichloride occurs. The so obtained product can be treated one or more times for example with an excess of TiCl4, at a temperature between 80 and 135Â°C. This treatment is followed by washings with hydrocarbon solvents until chloride ions disappeared. According to a further method, the product obtained by co-milling the magnesium chloride in an anhydrous state and the titanium compound is treated with halogenated hydrocarbons such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane etc. The treatment is carried out for a time between 1 and 4 hours and at temperature of from 40Â°C to the boiling point of the halogenated hydrocarbon. The product obtained is then generally washed with inert hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane. According to another method, magnesium dichloride is pre-activated according to well-known<br><br>
methods and then treated with an excess of TiCLj at a temperature of about 80 to 135Â°C. The treatment with TiCL4 is repeated and the solid is washed with hexane in order to eliminate any non-reacted TiCL4<br>
A further method comprises the reaction between magnesium alcoholates or chloroalcoholates (in particular chloroalcoholates prepared according to U.S. 4,220,554) and an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature of about 80 to 120Â°C.<br>
According to a preferred general method, the solid catalyst component can be prepared by reacting a titanium compound of formula Ti(ORn)n.yXy, where X, Rn, n, and y have the same meanings described above, with. a magnesium chloride deriving from an adduct of formula MgCl2.pROH, where p is a number between 0.1 and 6, preferably from 2 to 3.5, and R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1-18 carbon atoms. The adduct can be suitably prepared in spherical form by mixing alcohol and magnesium chloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon immiscible with the adduct, operating under stirring conditions at the melting temperature of the adduct (100-130 Â°C). Then, the emulsion is quickly quenched, thereby causing the solidification of the adduct in form of spherical particles. The so obtained adduct can be directly reacted with the Ti compound or it can be previously subjected to theimally controlled dealcoholation (80-130 Â°C) so as to obtain an adduct in which the number of moles of alcohol is generally lower than 3 preferably between 0.1 and 2.5, The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out for example by suspending the adduct (dealcoholated or as such) in cold TiCU (generally 0Â°C); the mixture is heated up to 80-130 Â°C and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2 hours. The treatment with TiCU can be carried out one or more times.<br>
The preparation of catalyst components in spherical form is described for example in Indian Patent Nos. 174661 and 194745.<br>
According to a variation of the method described above the preparation of the solid catalyst components can comprise the following steps:<br>
(a)	reacting a compound MgCl2.mROH, wherein 0.3 
(b)	reacting the product obtained from (a) with an Al-alkyl compound and<br>
(c)	reacting the product obtained from (b) with a titanium compound of the formula<br><br>
Ti(ORn)nXy-n, in which n? y, X and Rn have the meanings explained above . As mentioned above, the compound MgCVmROH can be prepared by thermal dealcoholation of adducts MgCl2'peiOH, having a higher alcohol content<br>
In the reaction of step (a) the molar ratio Ti/Mg is stoichiometric or higher; preferably this ratio in higher than 3. Still more preferably a large excess of titanium compound is used. Preferred titanium compounds are titanium tetrahalides, in particular TiCU.<br>
In step (b) the product obtained from (a) is then reacted with an aluminum-alkyl compound. The aluminum alkyl compound is preferably selected from those of formula RZA1X3.Z in which R is a C1-C20 hydrocarbon group, z is an integer from 1 to 3 and X is halogen, preferably chlorine. Particularly preferred is the use of the trialkyl aluminum compounds such as for example triethylalurninum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum and tris(2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl)aluminum. . Use of tris(2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl)aluminum is especially preferred. It is also possible to use mixtures of trialkylaluminum compounds with alkylaluminum halides, alkylaluminum hydrides or alkylaluminum sesquichlorides, such as AlEt2Cl and Al2Et3Cl3.<br>
The reaction with the Al-alkyl compound with the product coming from (a) can be carried out in a hydrocarbon solvent at a temperature between -10Â°C and 130Â°C. Preferably the reaction is â : carried out at a temperature between 40 and 110Â°C. The molar ratio between the Al-alkyl compound and the product coming from (a) is not particularly critical. Generally the Al-alkyl compound can be used in molar ratios with the alcohol originally contained in the compound (a) from 0.01 to 100.<br>
In the third step, the solid product coming from (b) is further reacted with a titanium compound of the same formula given above. Preferably, the specific titanium compound and the reaction conditions are similar to those used in the step (a). The use of the catalyst components prepared by this method is preferred.<br>
Moreover, it constitutes a preferred aspect of the invention also the use of catalyst components obtained by another variation of the general method described above and that comprises (a) the thermal dealcoholation of the adducts MgCl2'pEtOH until forming adducts in which the alcohol content is reduced to values lower than 2 and preferably comprised between 0.3 and 1.5 mols per mol of magnesium dihalide, (b) the treatment of said thermally dealcoholated adduct with chemical reagents capable of reacting with the OH groups of the alcohol and of further<br><br>
dealcoholating the adduct until the content is reduced to values which are generally lower than<br>
0.5 mols and (c) the reaction of said chemically dealcoholated adduct with a Ti compound of<br>
formula Ti(ORn)n-yXy, where X, Ru, n, and y have the same meanings described above. The<br>
adducts can also be dealcoholated to a very great extent, by reducing the alcohol content down to<br>
values lower than 0.05 mols.<br>
The treatment with the dealcoholating chemical agents is carried out by using an amount of such<br>
an agent which is large enough to react with the OH groups present in the alcohol contained in<br>
the adduct. Preferably, the treatment is carried out using a slight excess of said agent, which is<br>
then removed prior to the reaction of the titanium compound with the thus obtained support.<br>
In the event that the chemical dealcoholation of the MgCl2-pROH adduct is carried out by using<br>
agents having a reducing activity, for instance an Al-alkyl compound such as Al-triethyl, the thus<br>
obtained compound, prior to the reaction with the titanium compound, can be treated with a<br>
deactivating agent, for instance 02, in order to deactivate the Al-triethyl possibly present<br>
therefore avoiding the reduction of the titanium compound.<br>
The treatment with deactivating agents is avoided when one wishes to at least partially reduce<br>
the titanium compound. If, on the other hand, one wishes to reduce the titanium compound to a<br>
very great extent, the process for preparing the catalyst component can advantageously comprise<br>
the use of reducing agents.<br>
The solid catalyst components obtained according to the methods that comprise the use of<br>
MgCVpEtOH adducts generally show a surface area (by B.E.T. method) generally between 20<br>
and 500 m2/g and preferably between 50 and 400 m2/g, and a total porosity (by B.E.T. method) I<br>
higher than 0.2 cm /g preferably between 0.2 and 0.6 cm /g. The porosity (Hg method) due to<br>
pores with radius up to 10000 A generally ranges from 0.3 to 1.5 cm3/g, preferably from 0.45 to<br>
1 cm3/g.<br>
As explained above, the pre-polymerized catalyst component can be obtained by pre-<br>
polymerizing the solid catalyst component together with the Î±Î² olefm. Said a-olefin is<br>
preferably selected from propylene, butene-1, hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, and octene-1. The<br>
use of propylene is particularly preferred.<br>
The pre-polymerization is normally carried out in the presence of an Al-alkyl compound.<br>
The alkyl-Al compound (B) is preferably chosen among the trialkyl aluminum compounds<br>
such  as  for example triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum,  tri-n-<br><br>
hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. It is also possible to use mixtures of trialkylaluminum's with alkylaluminum halides, alkylaluminum hydrides or alkylaluminum sesquichlorides such as AlEt2Cl and Al2Et3Cl3.<br>
It h In particular said amoas been found particularly advantageous to carry out said pre-polymerization using low amounts of alkyl-Al compound.unt could be such as to have an Al/Ti molar ratio from 0.001 to 50, preferably from 0.01 to 10 and more preferably from 0.05 to 2.5. The pre-polymerization can be carried out in liquid phase, (slurry or solution) or in gas-phase at temperatures generally lower than 50Â°C, preferably between -20 and 30Â°C and more preferably between -10 and 20Â°C. Furthermore, it is preferably carried out in a liquid diluent in particular selected from liquid hydrocarbons. Among them, pentane, hexane and heptane are preferred.<br>
As explained, the so obtained pre-polymerized catalyst components can be used in the (co)polymerization of ethylene, allowing to obtain high activity, polymers with high bulk densityjmd very good morphology. In particular, the catalysts of the invention are endowed with features that render them particularly suitable for the liquid (bulk or slurry) and gas-phase polymerization processes which operate with a pre-polymerization step. In addition, since the catalysts have not aging problems they can be also pre-polymerized in a batch scale and then used in liquid or gas-phase olefin polymerization plants operating without a pre-polymerization line.<br>
In particular, said ethylene (co)polymerization processes can be carried out in the presence of a catalyst comprising (A) the pre-polymerized catalyst component; and (B) an Al-alkyl compound of the type described above.<br>
The above process is suitable for the preparation of wide range of polyethylene products. As an example, the following products can be prepared: high density ethylene polymers (HDPE, having a density higher than 0.940 g/cm ), comprising ethylene homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene with ct-olefins having 3-12 carbon atoms; linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm3) and very low density and ultra low density (VLDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm , to 0.880 g/cm) consisting of copolymers â¢ of ethylene with one or more a-olefins having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, having a mole content of units derived from the ethylene higher than 80%; The above described polymerization process can be carried out under the polymerization<br><br>
conditions generally known in the art. Accordingly, the polymerization is generally carried out<br>
at temperature of from 20 to 120oC,	preferably of from 40 to 80Â°C. In any of the polymerization<br>
processes used (liquid or gas-phase polymerization) the catalyst forming components (A) and<br>
(B) can be pre-contacted before adding them to the polymerization reactor. Said pre-contacting<br>
step can be carried out in the absence of polymerizable olefin or optionally in the presence of<br>
said olefin in an amount up to 3 g per g of solid catalyst component. The catalyst forming<br>
components can be contacted with a liquid inert hydrocarbon solvent such as propane, n-hexane,<br>
or n-heptane at a temperature below about 60Â°C and preferably from about 0Â°C to 30Â°C for a<br>
time period of from 10 seconds to 60 minutes.<br>
When a gas-phase polymerization process is used, it can be carried out according to known<br>
techniques operating in one or more reactors having a fluidized or mechanically agitated bed.<br>
Inert fluids .such as nitrogen, or low hydrocarbons like propane, can be used both as a<br>
fluidization aid and in order to improve the thermal exchange within the reactors. In addition,<br>
also techniques increasing the removal of the reaction heat comprising the introduction of<br>
liquids, optionally in mixture with gas, into the reactors, can be used. Preferably the liquids are<br>
fresh or make-up monomers. Such techniques are disclosed for example in EP-A-89691, EP-A-<br>
241947, USP 5,352,749, WO94/28032 and EPA-695313.<br>
The following examples are given in order better illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>

General procedure for the standard propylene polymerization test<br>
A 4 liter steel autoclave equipped with a stirrer, pressure gauge, thermometer, catalyst feeding<br>
system, monomer feeding lines and thermostatting jacket, was used. The reactor was charged<br>
with 0.01 g of solid catalyst component and with TEAL, and cyclohexyl-methyl dimethoxy<br>
silane in such amounts to give an Al/Si molar ratio of 4. Moreover, 3.2 1 of propylene, and 1.5 1<br>
of hydrogen were added. The system was heated to 70Â°C over 10 min. under stirring, and<br>
maintained under these conditions for 120 min. At the end of the polymerization, the polymer<br>
was recovered by removing any non-reacted monomers and was dried under vacuum.<br>

Determination of Xylene Insolubility<br>
2.5 g of polymer were dissolved in 250 ml of o-xylene under stirring at 135Â°C for 30 minutes,<br>
then the solution was cooled to 25Â°C and after 30 minutes the insoluble polymer was filtered.<br>
The resulting solution was evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue was dried and weighed to<br>
determine the percentage of soluble polymer and then, by difference the xylene insoluble<br>
fraction (%).<br>

PREPARATION OF THE SPHERICAL SUPPORT (ADDUCT MaCk/EtCH)<br>
A magnesium chloride and alcohol adduct was prepared following the method described in<br>
example 2 of l^P 4^399^054, but working at 2000 RPM instead of 10000 RPM.<br>
Preparation of Solid Catalyst Component<br>
The spherical support, prepared according to the general method underwent a thermal treatment,<br>
under N2 stream, over a temperature range of 50-150Â°C until spherical particles having a residual<br>
alcohol content of about 25% were obtained.<br>
Into a 72 1 steel reactor provided with stirrer, 44 liters of TiCU at 0Â°C and whilst stirring 2200 g<br>
of the support were introduced. The whole was heated to 130Â°C over 60 minutes and these<br>
conditions were maintained for a further 60 minutes. The stirring was interrupted and after 30<br>
minutes the liquid phase was separated from the settled solid. Thereafter 4 washings, with<br>
anhydrous hexane (about 22 liters) were performed two of which were carried out at 80Â°C and<br>
two at room temperature.<br>
Then, after the addition of 31 liters of anhydrous hexane, 11 liters of a solution of tris(2,4,4-<br>
trimethyl-pentyl)aluminum (Tioa) in hexane (100 g/1) were introduced at room temperature into<br>
the reactor and stirred for 30 minutes. The liquid phase was separated from the settled solid that<br>
was washed with 22 liters of hexane and with 22 liters of heptane (twice for each other) at room<br>
temperature.<br>
Thereafter a further treatment with 44 liters of TiCU was performed under the same condition<br>
used for the first one, and after 4 washings with anhydrous hexane, 2200 g of the spherical solid<br>
component were obtained. After drying under vacuum at about 50Â°C, the solid showed the<br>
following characteristics:<br>

Into a 2.5 liters glass reactor provided with stirrer, 1.5 liters of hexane at Temperature of 20Â°C and, whilst stirring, 40 g of the spherical catalyst were introduced. Keeping constant the internal temperature, 20 g of triisobutylaluminum (T3BA) in hexane (about 20 g/1) were (slowly) introduced at room temperature into the reactor. Then 40 g of propylene were carefully introduced into the reactor at the same temperature (with a propylene partial pressure of 40 mmHg). The consumption of propylene in the reactor was monitored and the polymerization was discontinued when a theoretical conversion of 1 g of polymer per g of catalyst was deemed to be reached. After 3 hexane washing at T = 20Â°C (50 g/1), we dried and analyzed the resulting pre-polymerized catalyst that contained 1.1 g of polypropylene per g of catalyst. Ethylene polymerization (HDPE)<br>
