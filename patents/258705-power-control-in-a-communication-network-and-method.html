Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to radio power control in a wireless network and more<br>
specifically to power control of wireless transmissions in a wireless system utilizing<br>
Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA).<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Wireless network solutions are currently being installed at an increasing rate to follow<br>
the demand from the market for faster data communication connections and wider<br>
wireless coverage of data and voice communication. This demand comes from the fact<br>
that the number of services available in public networks, such as the Internet, increases<br>
and the contents of many services has a high bandwidth demand. For instance, services<br>
such as music and video streaming acquire a high portion of available bandwidth, Voice<br>
over IP (VoIP) applications also sets up a demand for higher bandwidth than pure text<br>
messages or html data traffic. Voice and VoIP applications also need a certain level of<br>
Quality of Service (QoS) in order to reduce latency problems which will degrade the<br>
experienced quality of communication. The human is very sensitive to this kind of<br>
latency problem.<br>
When setting up the infrastructure for such wireless communication networks, care and<br>
consideration must be taken in order to obtain efficient coverage. Many problems may<br>
arise in building infrastructure installations since radio communication may be affected<br>
by many different disturbances, such as obstacles, other radio sources, moving<br>
communication devices, and so on. This is true for fixed installation and even more<br>
important for semi fixed or ad hoc network infrastructure installations where it is<br>
extremely difficult to predict how infrastructure nodes will interact with each other and<br>
with client stations.<br>
In a wireless network with several client stations, sharing the media through time-<br>
division, it is important to reduce the number of collisions occurring when multiple<br>
stations try to communicate with an infrastructure node, such as a so called Access Point<br>
(AP) or base station. One scheme for reducing this risk has been developed for fixed<br>
wired data networks and is called CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) with a collision<br>
detection (CD) system; however, it is very difficult not to say impossible to implement<br>
the CD scheme efficiently in a wireless network without using two radio interfaces<br>
operating simultaneously. Therefore, in a wireless network another system is often used:<br>
a Collision Avoidance (CA) CSMA system. A client station in such a network must before<br><br>
transmitting traffic, sense the medium to determine if another client station is<br>
transmitting. If so, the sensing client station must wait for a minimum specified duration<br>
plus a random number of time before initiating a transmission again. However, again the<br>
client station must sense the medium for ongoing traffic before transmitting signals.<br>
One problem not solved by the CSMA/CA system in wireless networks is the so called<br>
hidden node problem, wherein two stations try to communicate with an infrastructure<br>
node, such as a so called access point (AP) or base station, or with another client station<br>
in for instance an ad-hoc based network at the same time and they due to network<br>
topology considerations can not detect communication from each other. This may occur<br>
for instance when two client stations are located on opposite sides of an infrastructure<br>
node in such a way that radio signals can not reach from one client station to another, or<br>
two client stations both try to communicate with another client station located in such a<br>
way that the first two client stations do not detect each others transmissions.<br>
A scheme solving the hidden node problem is the so called RTS/CTS scheme (Request to<br>
Send/Clear to Send), wherein nodes communicating with each other must exchange<br>
control packets in order to establish a connection before transmitting actual data<br>
packets. However, this solution introduces a large overhead in control traffic slowing<br>
down communication links and increases the radio transmission overhead.<br>
A crucial parameter in wireless networks for the above mentioned situations is the<br>
transmission power level. The power level affects the range of signals, power<br>
consumption in devices, interference between nodes, and so on and is thus important to<br>
control in a wireless network system. However, a crude power control aiming only at<br>
reducing the power levels used, may lead to an increase of hidden node problems.<br>
Several different attempts to control transmission power for both clients and<br>
infrastructure nodes have been developed previously for certain applications. In some<br>
wireless protocol solutions regulatory demands has been raised in order to be able to set<br>
the maximum allowed transmit power in a network cell. This is true for the IEEE 802.11h<br>
protocol standard which is an amendment of the IEEE 802.11a protocol standard in<br>
Europe. However, in this case only the maximum allowed transmission level is adjustable<br>
in order to allow for regulatory demands, this problem do not address the problem of<br>
reducing the power consumption for devices or the hidden node problem.<br>
Several authors have addressed the power consumption problem and may be found<br>
described in different documents. For instance in WO03003657 Soomro et al disclose a<br><br>
method and apparatus for adjusting the transmission power level by determining a<br>
signal to noise margin for the communication link of interest. This scheme is however<br>
limited to addressing such problems as of limiting the transmitter power in general, for<br>
battery consumption purposes, avoiding radio interference. It does not try to remedy the<br>
problem of the hidden node situation discussed above.<br>
US 2003/0100328 discloses adjustment of the power level for both mobile stations (STA)<br>
and an access point (AP) in order to minimize radio coverage of an AP in order to reduce<br>
interference problems between access points in an area of high AP density. However,<br>
this invention only deals with signalling of transmit power control levels to mobile<br>
stations and not how to determine the power levels.<br>
In WO9907105 again a system for using optimum transmission levels in a wireless<br>
multihop network is disclosed. This applies for the situation when stations communicate<br>
with each other and the system takes different quality disturbing parameters into<br>
account, such as path loss, phase distortion, time delay, Doppler shift, and multipath<br>
fading, all concerned with radio characteristics. However, the invention does not take<br>
hidden node problems into account when determining the optimum path for a data<br>
packet.<br>
In WO0057575 a path loss estimate is calculated from received power levels during<br>
transmission and continued communication power levels are based on this estimate. A<br>
similar function is found in WO02091623 but with a slightly different path loss estimation<br>
function.<br>
In US 5,553,316 an invention is disclosed that adjusts the transmit power level in order<br>
to use only the needed power level for obtaining a reliable transmission. Again, the<br>
hidden node problem is not solved. However, a defer threshold value is introduced that<br>
limits a sending station to withholding communication when a carrier signal above the<br>
defer threshold value is sensed by the sender.<br>
In US patent application 2004/0029590 the hidden node problem is addressed by<br>
transmitting data traffic from an access point at a lower power level reducing the risk for<br>
the interference problems since thus a lower number of stations can hear the<br>
transmission. However, in order to make stations outside the communication area aware<br>
of the network, control traffic (such as RTS/CTS/ACK) is transmitted using a higher<br>
power level. This system does not address the problem of determining appropriate power<br><br>
levels to avoid hidden node problems when said control traffic, that cause significant<br>
overhead, is not used.<br>

Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be understood from the following<br>
detailed description together with the accompanying drawings.<br>

the present invention.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a schematic block diagram of an apparatus of a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a network structure comprising several coverage cells according to the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic network topology according to the present invention,<br>
wherein a radio coverage cell 100 is determined from an access point 101, with "access<br>
point" is meant a central transceiving unit with which mobile stations communicate and<br>
gain access through to a packet based network, such a central unit may also be<br>
described as a connection point, wireless gateway, or a base station. In the cell, one or<br>
several mobile units 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 may communicate with the access<br>
point 101 using a wireless communication application. The access point is connected 110<br>
in turn to an IP network 111 or any similar packet based network through any<br>
connection means as understood by the person skilled in the art. The connection means<br>
110 may either be a wired fixed line connection or a wireless fixed line connection.<br>
In order to reduce the risk of traffic collisions in a wireless network, different collision<br>
avoidance protocols have been developed. One such collision avoidance protocol is the<br>
so called CSMA/CA protocol (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance). The<br>
CSMA/CA protocol forces nodes 101...106 to listen for a carrier signal present in the<br>
network and only if no such signal is detected is the node 101...106 allowed to transmit a<br>
message. If such a carrier signal is detected, the node 101...106 has to wait for a<br>
predetermined period of time before trying again. However, if nodes 101...106 in a<br>
network are unable to detect each other, the CSMA/CA scheme will deteriorate. This may<br>
be illustrated by using Fig. 1. If for instance node 102 which is a mobile station (STA)<br>
tries to communicate with the access point 101 (AP) and nodes 102 and 106 is out of<br>
range from each other, then it is possible that node 106 tries to communicate<br>
simultaneously with the access point 101. In such a case neither node 102 or 106 will be<br>
able to communicate with the access point 101 at that time instant. Both nodes will then<br>
back off and wait for a predetermined amount of time plus a random period of time<br>
before trying again. However, this reconnection time could actually be the same for both<br>
nodes 102 and 106, causing a collision to take place again.<br>
In a wireless CSMA system it is important that potential interferers can detect a<br>
transmission. However, as is illustrated in Fig. 9, if a transmission from a station 902 in<br>
a first cell 900 triggers the carrier sensing mechanism in a station 922 that is too far<br>
away to obstruct the transmission, this leads to inefficiency. Since nodes that normally<br>
could communicate with other nodes or access points 921 in their associated cell, defer<br>
from communicating if transmission signals can be sensed in a neighboring cell 920.<br>
Thus, there is accordingly an optimal sensing distance for where a transmission should<br>
trigger a carrier sensing mechanism. A cell is defined herein as the area wherein mobile<br><br>
stations associated with a specific access point/connection point reside in. Cells may<br>
overlap or be adjacent to each other and may form a continous or discontinous coverage<br>
area. A maximum cell area may be defined as the maximum radio range from an access<br>
point/connection point.<br>
In an infrastructure network mobile stations 902...905, 912...913, and 922...925<br>
communicate with access points 901, 911, and 921 respectively. Many different criteria<br>
may be set up for determining the optimal carrier sensing distance for an access point or<br>
cell. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the optimal carrier sensing<br>
distance from the AP is determined from an estimation of the distance to the most<br>
remote mobile station associated with the access point. However, the carrier sensing<br>
distance for the mobile stations must be greater to be detected by a mobile station on<br>
the opposite side of the access point.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention this is solved by controlling the<br>
carrier sensing distance by adjusting the transmit power. The minimum transmit power<br>
PminAP of the access point is set so that the most distant mobile station receives the<br>
transmission with signal strength C0. The correct PminAP may be determined in two ways<br>
as can be illustrated in Figs 2 and 3:<br>
1.	Mobile stations 204 that detect transmissions from an access point 201 with signal<br>
strength below C0 send a message 210 to the access point 201 with information about<br>
the signal strength. In an IEEE 802.11k standard wireless protocol, functionality for this<br>
message is provided through the Beacon Report specified in the 802.11k standard.<br>
2.	If the transmit power of the mobile stations 302...304 is known to the access point<br>
301, the PminAP may be determined by measuring the signal strength of the most distant<br>
mobile station 304.<br>
The minimum transmit power PminMs of the mobile stations, is set to the minimum power<br>
of the access point, PminAP, plus a margin, M. The margin M may be set large enough for<br>
all transmissions from mobile stations to be detected by all other stations, but not larger.<br>
Alternatively, a smaller margin may be used in order to reduce inter-cell interference at<br>
the expense of allowing some intra-cell collisions.<br>
The margin M may be adjusted based on messages from mobile stations that only hear<br>
part of a frame exchange between two stations, as is illustrated in fig. 4. Mobile station<br>
405 can only detect traffic from the access point 401 to the mobile station 404. Traffic<br><br>
from the mobile station 404 to the access point is not strong enough to be detected by<br>
the mobile station 405. The mobile station 405 then issues a report message 410 of this<br>
information to the access point 401. In an IEEE 802.11k standard wireless protocol,<br>
functionality for this message is provided through the Hidden Node Report specified in<br>
the 802.11k standard.<br>
There are several ways of adjusting the margin M based on the messages including, but<br>
not limited to, a jump algorithm as illustrated in Fig. 5. The margin level is gradually<br>
lowered during time 501 and when the margin level passes a threshold where mobile<br>
stations trigger a message due to partially missing transmission detection as discussed<br>
above a report message 410 is sent to the access point 401. The margin M level is then<br>
increased with a jump to a new level 502 and during time this level is gradually lowered<br>
again, and so on. The new level is preferably substantially higher than the level that<br>
triggered the message response. The amount of increase may be determined from<br>
several different choices including, but not limited to, fixed level change in absolute<br>
figures, fixed percentage change, to a certain predefined level, or a randomly selected<br>
level change. The above jump algorithm may also be "reversed" in the respect that it is<br>
used for detecting to large power levels.<br>
The minimum mobile station power may also be estimated based on uplink<br>
measurements in the access point. The two weakest (presumably the most distant)<br>
mobile stations are identified, their path loss to the access point is measured and/or<br>
estimated, and the transmit power level is adjusted for the mobile stations to overcome<br>
the sum of the distances corresponding to their path losses. This will be enough transmit<br>
power to trigger the carrier sense for the worst case when two mobile stations are<br>
opposite to each other relative the access point. This is true provided the limiting factor<br>
is not an obstacle or other interference situation located between the two mobile<br>
stations.<br>
The appropriate and determined PminMs may be communicated to the mobile stations as a<br>
common message in a beacon or as individual messages to each mobile station.<br>
Mobile stations are normally associated with an access point according to different<br>
association criteria depending on infrastructure configuration, such as radio signal<br>
strength, transmission quality, average or intermittent bit rate, access point owner, and<br>
soon.<br><br>
Now turning to Fig. 6, preferably in e.g. single-cell scenarios, it is an advantage if it is<br>
possible for mobile stations 604 to detect and associate with an access point 601 further<br>
away from the access point 601 than the currently determined momentary carrier<br>
sensing distance, if so potentially increasing the coverage area. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention this is solved by alternating the transmit power of<br>
the access point when transmitting beacon frames with low power Pmin and high power,<br>
Pmax- Mobile stations that are further away 604 will still detect frames transmitted with<br>
Pmax and may associate with the access point 601. Mobile stations located within the<br>
carrier sensing distance will receive frames transmitted with both high and low powers.<br>
Also the first method of detecting too low transmit power of an access point described<br>
above will work correctly since the frames that are transmitted with Pmln will trigger the<br>
report (e.g. the Beacon Report).<br>
In an 802.11 standard network infrastructure both passive and active scanning is<br>
available. The above mentioned solutions is described and illustrated in the case of<br>
passive scanning mode of the network. In a passive scanning mode, a radio network<br>
interface card (NIC) searches for access points. Periodically, access points broadcast a<br>
beacon, and the radio NIC receives these beacons while scanning and takes note of the<br>
corresponding signal strengths. The beacons contain information about the access point,<br>
including service set identifier (SSID), supported data rates, etc. The radio NIC can use<br>
this information along with the signal strength to compare access points and decide upon<br>
which one to use.<br>
Active scanning is similar, except that the radio NIC of the mobile station initiates the<br>
process by broadcasting a probe frame, and all access points within range respond with<br>
a probe response. Active scanning enables a radio NIC to receive immediate response<br>
from access points, without waiting for a beacon transmission.<br>
In the case of mobile stations using active scanning it is possible to solve the problem by<br>
sending probe response messages with power level Pmax (which need not be the<br>
maximum available transmission power level but is the currently set allowed maximum<br>
transmission power level) or at least a transmission level higher than Pmln.<br>
In some cases it is desirable to increase the transmission power level in order to increase<br>
the bit rate at the cost of increased interference. The use of such higher power levels<br>
may be based on the measurements on access points and mobile stations not associated<br>
to the access point that is controlled. If no surrounding wireless communication is<br>
detected there is no need to decrease the power level. This may be controlled per mobile<br><br>
station, using Pm)nMs in one end of the served area while using a higher power of<br>
transmissions from the access point.<br>
Advantages of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are:<br>
•	The transmit powers are automatically adjusted to fit the current spatial<br>
distribution of mobile stations.<br>
•	Increased quality and capacity when access points are located close to each<br>
other, i.e. high density infrastructure installations.<br>
•	Reduced power consumption in the mobile stations and access points.<br>
In Fig. 7 a method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is<br>
schematically illustrated in a block diagram. The method comprises the steps of:<br>
1.	In mobile stations, detecting transmissions from an access point (step 701);<br>
2.	Measuring the received signal strength (step 702);<br>

predefined threshold level (step 703); and<br>

5.	Setting the transmission power level for the mobile stations to above<br>
transmission power level for the access point with a margin enabling mobile<br>
stations within the cell to detect transmission from mobile stations (step 705) to<br>
such an extent that the hidden node problems are kept on a reasonable level.<br>
6.	Sending the above transmission power level to the mobile stations.<br>
In another method of an embodiment of the present invention the access point is<br>
responsible for detecting the transmission level. Fig. 7 may be used for the illustrative<br>
purposes again, the method comprising the steps:<br>

2.	Determining the transmission power level of the transmission from the mobile<br>
stations (step 702);<br>
3.	Calculating or estimating a coverage model using the determined transmission<br>
power and quality levels (step 703);<br>
4.	Setting the transmission power level of the access point so all mobile stations can<br>
detect transmissions (step 704).<br><br>
5. Setting the transmission power level for the mobile stations to above<br>
transmission level for the access point with a margin enabling mobile stations<br>

extent that the hidden node problems are kept on a reasonable level.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 8 wherein an access point apparatus 800 for use in an infrastructure<br>
solution according to the present invention is schematically illustrated in a block<br>
diagram. An apparatus 800 in such a network solution includes at least one processing<br>
unit 801, at least one storage means 802, and at least one radio communication unit<br>
808 with an optional antenna 807. Optionally other units may be included in the<br>
apparatus as well, such as communication means 806 for a LAN and/or WAN connectivity<br>
805, such as e.g. Ethernet, Token Ring, Local Talk, X.25, ATM, ADSL, ISDN, GSM, 3G, or<br>
even an optical fiber connectivity link, serial communication or similar connectivity means,<br>
connection 805 for external storage modules, and so on.<br>
A mobile station apparatus (not shown, but Fig. 8 may be used for illustrative purposes<br>
as well) consist of similar units and means as an access point apparatus 800.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a network topology where several coverage cells 900, 910, and 920 are<br>
located close to each other and where mobile stations 902, 903, 904, 905, 912, 913,<br>
922, 923, 924, and 925 may move between cells 900, 910, and 920. The mobile stations<br>
are associated to respective connection points 901, 911, and 921 depending on signal<br>
strength, connection point ownership, connection point throughput or other<br>
characteristics governing transmission quality or costs. For instance in Fig. 9 mobile<br>
station 905 may associate with either connection point 901 or 911.<br>
It should be appreciated by the person skilled in the art that even though the present<br>
invention has been illustrated by nodes in the form of mobile stations using wireless<br>
communication protocols in the IEEE 802.11 standard series; such limitation is only for<br>
illustrative reasons. The nodes may be any kind of wireless communication device<br>
connecting to an access point or base station, including, but not limited to, mobile<br>
stations such as PDA's (personal digital assistants), laptop computers, telephones using<br>
a wireless interface, and non mobile stations such as personal computers, workstations,<br>
household appliances, industrial equipment, and so on. Wireless communication links<br>
may be upheld by one or several different protocols using a CSMA scheme, including, but<br>
not limited to, 802.11 series, UWB, IEEE 802.15, HomeRF, IR, and JTRS.<br><br>
Also it should be appreciated by the person skilled in the art that the above mentioned<br>
embodiments of the present invention may also be applicable in an ad-hoc network<br>
topology, wherein no central controlling node (e.g. an access point) is present instead all<br>
nodes, e.g. client stations, infrastructure building nodes, or combinations of these two,<br>
together form the network and may even relay traffic between nodes, between cells, and<br>
to dedicated gateways to an IP network not being part of the ad-hoc network, such as<br>
the Internet, other external IP network or internal IP networks e.g. an internal company<br>
network allowing wireless stations work in parallel with a fixed network structure without<br>
mixing the two networks for instance in order to reduce security issues. A relaying node<br>
may be called a connection point. In the case of an ad-hoc network topology a cell may<br>
be defined in several different ways depending on network model, e.g. a cell may be<br>
defined as the area wherein nodes are connected with each other with a certain IP sub-<br>
address, as an area covered by radio transmissions from a connection point (relaying<br>
node, or a gateway), or as an area defined by all nodes serviced by a certain gateway<br>
with access to a fixed IP network or another cell.<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration, it is to<br>
be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that variations can be made<br>
