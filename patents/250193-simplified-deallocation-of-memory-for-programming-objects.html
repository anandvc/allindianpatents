FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to memory management for objects and more<br>
specifically to a method of releasing the memory associated with a set of objects that have a<br>
hierarchical tree relationship.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Memory management refers to operations and processes that are performed to<br>
manage the allocation and deallocation of memory for storing objects or other data<br>
structures; Typically, most applications use the memory management code that is supplied<br>
by the computer language that the applications are written in. however, the memory<br>
management code supplied by the computer language may not have certain desirable<br>
features such as optimization for performance, optimization for memory allocation, or<br>
releasing memory for a set of objects that have a relationship to each other.<br>
[0004] In the object-oriented wor4ld, supplying unique memory management code to<br>
an application entails overriding the new and delete operators in every class that is used to<br>
create objects in that application. The problem with this is that each class used to create<br>
objects in the application require a separate copy of the memory management code to<br>
override the new and delete operators in those classes. Having many copies of the<br><br>
memory management code complicates not only routine maintenance but also<br>
complicates providing enhancements. For example, whenever a bug is found in the<br>
memory management code, the memory management code in each class has to be<br>
modified.<br>
[0005] When there is a relationship between a set of objects, an application program<br>
has to track the relationship between these objects in order to release memory associated<br>
with.the objects in the proper order. For example, for any given database connection, one<br>
or more queries are executed involving statements, and resultsets are returned in response<br>
to the queries. Therefore, a hierarchical relationship exists between a database<br>
connection, and the related statements, resultsets, and streams. The connection, and<br>
related statements, resultsets, and streams can each be represented by their own object<br>
and these objects can be organized in a hierarchical tree that reflects the relationship<br>
between these objects. For example, the connection object is the top object in a<br>
hierarchical tree, the statement objects are directly under the connection object, the<br>
resultset objects are directly under the statement objects and so on. Memory is needed for<br>
executing methods associated with the objects or for perfonriing computations on behalf<br>
of the objects, among other things. Therefore, memory is associated with each object in<br>
the hierarchical tree (heremafter referred to as a "memory management tree").<br>
[0006] A particular object and the objects below that object form a subtree of the<br>
hierarchical tree. For example, a particular statement object and all the objects below that<br>
particular statement object, such as resultset objects and stream objects, form a subtree of<br>
a hierarchical tree. A subtree and the memory associated with the objects in the subtree<br>
form a memory management subtree. When a particular object is no longer needed, the<br>
memory management subtree, which includes the particular object, the objects below this<br>
particular object (hereinafter referred to as "descendents" of the particular object), and the<br>
memory associated with all of these objects, is released. For example, once an<br>
application program is finished with a statement object, the statement object and all of the<br>
statement object's descendants (e.g., resultset objects and stream objects) can be released.<br>
The memory associated with these objects is also released. To do this, an application<br>
program has to track the relationship between the objects and the associated memory.<br>
The release of a memory management subtree needs to be done in such a way that other<br>
objects in the hierarchical tree and their associated memory is not released. For example,<br>
if a subtree that starts with a particular statement is released, the connection that this<br>
particular statement is associated with and the other statements associated with that<br>
connection should not be impacted.<br>
[0007] Therefore it can be seen that there is a need not only for providing unique memory<br>
management code for an application but to provide this memory management code in a way<br>
that it is shared by all the objects that are instances of the classes used in the application.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen that there is a need for tracking the relationship between a set of<br>
objects in a hierarchical tree and the memory associated with these objects in a way that is<br>
transparent to an application program. In so doing, the application program can issue a<br>
release for one particular object in the hierarchical tree that results in releasing the memory<br>
management subtree that starts with that particular object.<br>
[0007.1] US patent No. 6,327,606 issued to CHIDAMBARAN is incorporated herein by way<br>
of reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] Techniques are described for providing memory management for objects.<br>
Specifically, techniques are described for providing common memory management code to<br>
objects that are instances of different classed and for releasing a memory management<br>
subtree that starts with a particular object in the memory management tree.<br>
[0011] With regards to providing common memory management for objects, a template<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a memory management template) is used to provide common pre-<br>
processor memory management code. An abstract class, that defines memory management<br>
interfaces, is passed into this memory management template to create a "specialized<br>
template" during compilation. The specialized template is used to subclass a second class<br>
(referred to hereinafter as a "specialized template subclasss"). The specialized semplate<br>
subclasses contain memory management executables that are generated from the common<br>
pre-processor memory management code during compile time. According to one<br>
embodiment, the specialized template subclass provides implementations for the interfaces in<br>
the abstract class. When a memory management operator, such as new or delete, of an<br>
object that is an instance of the specialized template subclass, is invoked, the memory<br>
management executable in the specialized template is executed.<br>
[0012] For example, an abstract class A_Abs provides interfaces. A template MM<t><br>
provides the common pre-processor memory management code that provides interfaces and<br>
implementations for a common memory manager by overloading the new and delete<br><br>
operators. When A_Abs is passed into the generic parameter "T" of template MM<t>, a<br>
specialized template, MM<a_abs>, is created. During the pre-processor phase of<br>
compilation, the generic parameter T is replaced with the specified parameter A_Abs to<br>
produce executable code in the specialized template MM<a_abs>. MM<a_abs> is used to<br>
subclass A_STS, which is a specialized template subclass. When the new or delete operator of<br>
an object that is an instance of class A_STS is invoked, the new or delete operator in<br>
MM<a_abs> is executed instead of the new or delete operator supplied by the computer<br>
language.<br>
[0013] With regards to releasing a memory management subtree, memory is<br>
associated with each object in a hierarchical tree. Data for the memory is maintained that<br>
reflects the hierarchical tree relationship between the objects in the hierarchical tree. In so<br>
doing, a subtree and the associated memory can be released with a single instruction, such<br>
as a destructor, without an application program tracking the relationship between the objects<br>
and the memory associated with the objects.<br>
[00013.1] One prior approach for releasing memory used by a complex object is described in<br>
U.S.Patent No.6,327,606 issued to Chidambaram. Chidambaram describes a mechanism for<br>
allocating pools of dynamic memory on a "per-call" basis for complex objects returned from<br>
procedure calls. Specifically, Chidambaram describes that the complex objects are created as<br>
a result of remote procedure calls. Pools of dynamic memory are allocated, corresponding to<br>
one or more of the remote procedure calls. Memory for said complex objects is allotted so<br>
that each complex object is allocated memory within a pool that corresponds to the remote<br>
procedure call that resulted in the creation of the complex object. Memory for the complex<br>
objects is released by de-allocating the entire pools within which the complex objects are<br>
allocated. In contrast, the techniques described herein provide for releasing a memory<br>
management tree by using data that defines a relationship between the memory for each<br>
object in the memory management three, where the data comprises child and sibling pointer<br>
pairs. To release a memory management subtree that starts with a particular object, the<br>
child and sibling pointer pairs are used to determine the descendants of the particular object,<br>
and then the memory associated with the particular object and the memory associated with<br>
the determined descendants of the particular object is released.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0026] A method for providing common memory management code to objects. In the<br>
following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set<br>
forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be<br>
apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific<br>
details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in. block<br>
diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.<br>
AN OVERVIEW OF A CLASS HIERARCHY USED IN COMMON MEMORY<br>
MANAGEMENT<br>
[0027] FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting three class hierarchies that use a memory<br>
management template to provide common memory management code to objects that are<br>
instances of different classes according to an embodiment of the present invention. All of<br>
the classes in the three class hierarchies, class hierarchy 1, class hierarchy 2, and class<br>
hierarchy 3, provide code in one form or another. Providing code refers to processes or<br>
acts that create code for subsequent compilation and execution. For example, a<br>
programmer provides code by entering source, in the form of classes, into a file where it<br>
may be accessed by a compiler for compilation. Providing code also refers to storing<br>
code in libraries for later compilation of other applications that refer to the libraries.<br>
[0028] The three class hierarchies are used to create objects that are instances of three<br>
specialized template subclasses, A_STS:MM<a_abs> 130, B_STS:MM<b_abs> 160<br>
and C_STS:MM<c_abs> 190 (the notation of these specialized template subclasses is in<br>
the following order: 1) the name of the class, 2) a colon, and 3) the name of the<br>
specialized template that is used to subclass the class). In the case of<br><br>
A_STS:MM<a_abs> 130, A_STS is the name of the class that is used to create an object<br>
and MM<a_abs> is the name of a specialized template subclass as will be described in<br>
more detail hereinafter. These objects contain memory management executables that are<br>
all generated from common pre-processor memory management code from a memory<br>
management template as is described in more detail below.<br>
[0029] At the top of each class hierarchy is an abstract class, A_Abs 110,<br>
B_Abs_140, and C_Abs 170, that provides interfaces (113, 114,143,144, 173) for<br>
methods (131, 132,161, 162, 191) that are implemented in the specialized template<br>
subclasses (130, 160, 190). By definition, an abstract class defines interfaces for methods<br>
and/or operators but does not provide implementations for the methods and/or operators.<br>
[0030] The common pre-processor memory management code for the new and delete<br>
operators is provided in a memory management template. The memory management<br>
template shall be referred to as MM<t> where T is a generic type parameter for passing a<br>
specific type into the memory management template. During the pre-processor phase of<br>
compilation, (1) the generic type parameter T is replaced with the specific type (e.g.,<br>
AAbs, B_Abs, C_Abs) that is passed into the memory management template, (2) the<br>
memory management template is replicated, and (3) the memory management template<br>
replications are specialized using the specific type passed into the generic parameter T to<br>
produce the specialized templates (120,150,180). For example, in the specialized<br>
template MM<a_abs> 120, the abstract class A_Abs 110 is the specific type passed into<br>
the generic parameter T.<br>
[0031] Therefore, each specialized template (120, 150, and 180) has its own memory<br>
management executable (121, 122, 151, 152,181, 182), which originated from the one<br>
copy of memory management pre-processor code in the memory management template.<br>
For example, new 121 and delete 122 are MM<a_abs> 120's own memory management<br>
executable. In like manner, the specialized templates (120, 150,180) have their own<br>
copies of data members, such as hndlp_ (123,153, and 183), used for storing data.<br>
[0032] Although MM<a_abs> 120, MM<b_abs> 150, and MM<c_abs> 180 each<br>
result in separate specialized templates that can be used to subclass another class (130,<br>
160, 190), only one copy of the memory management pre-processor code exists.<br>
Therefore, there is only one copy of memory management pre-processor code to maintain<br>
or enhance. That one copy of memory management pre-processor code is in the memory<br>
management template, as will be discussed in more detail.<br>
[0033] According to one embodiment, only one specialized template and one abstract<br>
class is provided. For example, assume that a generic memory management abstract<br><br>
class, MM_Abs is used only to provide a generic interface, such as an interface for<br>
creating an object of any type, and is used as the abstract class in the class hierarchies 1,<br>
2, and 3. Then the specialized templates 120,150,180 would all be MM<mm_abs> and<br>
the specialized template subclasses would be A_STS:MM<mm_abs> 130,<br>
B_STS:MM<mm_abs> 160, and C_STS:MM<mm_abs> 190.<br>
[0034] The specialized templates (120, 150, 180) are used to create specialized<br>
template subclasses (130, 160, 190). According to one embodiment, the specialized<br>
template subclasses (130, 160, 190) implement the non-memory management interfaces<br>
(113, 114, 143, 144, 173) of the abstract classes (110, 140, 170) in methods (131, 132,<br>
161, 162, 191). For example, MM<a_abs> 120 is used to subclass<br>
A_STS:MM<a_abs> 130. The non-memory management interfaces 113 and 114 are<br>
implemented in methods 131 and 132 as will be discussed in more detail. According to<br>
one embodiment, one specialized template subclass (130, 160, or 190) provides a factory<br>
method (131 or 161) to create objects that are instances of another specialized template<br>
subclass. For example, create_B_STS 131, which is in A_STS:MM<a_abs> 130, is a<br>
factory method that creates objects that are instances of class B_STS:MM<b_abs> 160.<br>
As will be seen, factory methods provide a mechanism for minimizing the number of<br>
times a pointer to memory, such as a common heap, is passed as a parameter when<br>
invoking methods.<br>
[0035] Throughout this application, various operations and actions are described as<br>
being performed by or taking place at code and instructions. However, tins is just a<br>
convenient way of stating that the code of instructions, or code compiled therefrom, when<br>
executed, cause the operations and actions to be performed.<br>
THE MEMORY MANAGEMENT TEMPLATE<br>
[0036] FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting a memory management template that<br>
provides common pre-processor memory management code according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The memory management template, as depicted in FIG. 2,<br>
provides the common pre-processor memory management code, which provides<br>
interfaces (204, 205) and implementations (230, 240) for a common memory manager by<br>
overloading the new and delete operators. Classes and templates typically have two<br>
portions: (1) a definition portion that defines interfaces for methods and/or operators, and<br>
(2) an implementation portion that defines the code for the method and/or operator. MM<br>
Template 200 depicts the memory management template's definition. In the public<br>
section of MM Template 200, three interfaces (202, 204, 205) are provided. One<br><br>
interface 202 corresponds to the MM Template's Constructor 210. The other two<br>
interfaces (new 204 and delete 205) correspond to common memory management<br>
implementations (230 and 240). In the protected section, a data member, hndlp_ 206, is<br>
provided. Data member hndlp_ 206 is used for storing a pointer to a heap or subheap<br>
used by the common pre-processor memory management code (230, 240). "T" (201, 211,<br>
231, 241) is the generic type parameter of the memory management template that is used<br>
to create specialized templates MM<connectionabs>, MM<statementabs>, and<br>
MM<resultsetabs>, as shall be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
[0037] According to one embodiment, the common pre-processor memory<br>
management code is provided in MM Template's new operator 230 and MM Template's<br>
delete operator 240. MM Template's new operator 230 provides the implementation code<br>
for the operator new interface 204. If no heap exists, the new operator 230 uses the<br>
default memory manager of the language the code is implemented in to allocate memory<br>
at instruction 232. If a heap does exist, specialized processing takes place at instruction<br>
233. This specialized processing may entail subdividing the heap, executing specialized<br>
perfonnance instructions, returning the pointer to an existing heap, or some other kind of<br>
specialized processing. MM Template's delete operator 240 is the implementation code<br>
for the operator delete interface 205. If a heap does exist, specialized processing takes<br>
place at instruction 242. This specialized processing may entail releasing the heap,<br>
releasing a subdivision of the heap, or some other kind of specialized processing.<br>
ABSTRACT CLASSES<br>
[0038] FIG. 3 is a block diagram depicting abstract classes that are passed into the<br>
memory management template as specific types to provide specialized templates<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. ConnectionAbs Class 300,<br>
StatementAbs Class 310, and ResultsetAbs Class 320 are examples of abstract classes<br>
that (1) provide interfaces that are implemented in the specialized template subclasses,<br>
and (2) are passed into the MM Template 200 as specific types. According to one<br>
embodiment, interfaces (301, 311) are provided in the abstract classes (300, 310, 320).<br>
For example, the implementations for these interfaces (301, 311) are provided in the<br>
specialized template subclass methods (510, 530). According to one embodiment, the<br>
interfaces (301, 311) in the abstract classes and the corresponding implementations (510,<br>
530) in the specialized template subclasses are for factory methods.<br><br>

subclasses according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 5 A and 5B are<br>
block diagrams depicting methods that implement the definitions for these specialized<br>
template subclasses according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
example, three specialized template subclass definitions (400, 410,420) are depicted.<br>
The specialized template subclasses are used to instantiate objects that access the<br>
common memory management code (Note that at code fragments 401,411, and 421,<br>
classes 400, 410, and 420 are subclasses of specialized templates). For example, if object<br>
A is an instance of ConnectionSTS Class 400, object B is an instance of StatementsTS<br>
Class 410, and object C is an instance of ResultsetSTS Class 420, then objects A, B, and<br>
C have memory management executables that were all generated from the same common<br>
pre-processor memory management code in the memory management template (200, 210,<br>
230, 240) during compile time.<br>
[0040] Each of the specialized template subclass definitions have a constructor<br>
interface (402, 412, 422). The respective implementations of the constructor interfaces<br>
are ConnectionSTS's Constructor 500, StatementSTS's Constructor 520, and<br>
ResultsetSTS's Constructor 540. Constructors are used to create objects that are<br>
instances of the classes the constructors belong to. One of the functions that constructors<br>
may provide is the initialization of an object's data members. For example, constructors<br>
500, 520, and 540 initialize data member hndlp_ 206 at instructions 501, 521, and 541 as<br>
will be described in more detail. In an alternative embodiment, data member hndlp_ 206<br>
is initialized at code fragment 212 when the MM Template's Constructor 210 is invoked<br>
during the instantiation process for an object as will be described in more detail.<br>
Constructors 500 and 520 initialize data members 405 and 415 at instructions 502 and<br>
522 respectively.<br>
[0041 ] According to object oriented programming, if an object is an instance of a<br>
subclass, the constructors are called in the order of their inheritance hierarchy during the<br>
instantiation process of the object. For example, if ConnectionSTS Class 400, which is a<br>
subclass of MM<connectionabs>, is used to create an object A, then ConnectionSTS :s<br>
Constructor 500 is invoked after the superclass's constructor,<br>
MM<connectionabs>::MM, which is a specialized version of MM Template's<br>
Constructor 210.<br>
[0042] According to one embodiment, the specialized template subclasses provide<br>
implementations of non-memory management interfaces that are in the abstract classes<br>
while the MM template 200 provides interfaces and implementations (230,240) of the<br>
memory management interfaces. For example, the specialized template subclass<br>
A_STS:MM<a_abs> 130 provides implementations for non-memory management<br>
interfaces, create_B_STS 113 and function_A 114, while MM<t> provides<br>
implementations of the memory management interfaces, new 111 and delete 112.<br>
[0043] According to another embodiment, one abstract class is used to provide only<br>
generic interfaces. For example, a generic abstract class, MM_Abs, could provide<br>
generic interfaces, such as an interface for creating an object of any type or for<br>
performing a type of process, and the generic parameter T in the memory management<br>
template, MM<t>, is replaced with MM_Abs to produce one specialized template<br>
MM<mm_abs>. In this case, the MMAbs would be passed into the specialized<br>
template subclasses at code fragments 401,411, and 421.<br>
[0044] According to one embodiment, the specialized template subclasses provide<br>
factory methods (403, 413) for creating objects that are instances of other specialized<br>
template subclasses. For example, the factory method createStatement 403 is used to<br>
create an object that is an instance of StatementSTS Class 410 as will be described in<br>
more detail. In creating objects that are instances of other specialized template<br>
subclasses, the factory method implementations (510, 530) invoke the new operator 230,<br>
at code fragments 511a and 532a respectively, to allocate memory for the objects and<br>
subsequently invoke the constructors for the other specialized template subclasses, at<br>
code fragments 511b and 532b respectively. For example, if factory method<br>
createStatement 510, which is a method in ConnectioaSTS Class 400, is used to create an<br>
object A, then code fragment 51 la invokes MM Template's new operator 230 to allocate<br>
memory for object A and StatementSTS's Constructor 520 is invoked at code fragment<br>
51 lb to "construct" object A. Then since StatementSTS Class 410 is a subclass of<br>
K4M<statementabs>, a specialized form of MM Template's Constructor 210,<br>
MM<statementabs>::MM, is invoked. According to one embodiment, when<br>
MM<statementabs>::MM is invoked, hndlp_ 206 is initialized at code fragment 212.<br>
AN OPERATIONAL EXAMPLE OF COMMON MEMORY MANAGEMENT<br>
[0045] FIG. 6 is a block diagram depicting an application program that creates<br>
objects, which use common memory management according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Application program 600 creates three such objects, a ConnectionSTS<br>
object, a StatementSTS object, and a ResultsetSTS object, in a series of instructions (602,<br>
S03, and 604). To summarize, a ConnectionSTS object, conn, is created at instruction<br><br>
602. A factory method in conn is invoked, at instruction 603, to create a StatementSTS<br>
object, stmt. Another factory method in stmt is invoked, at instruction 604, to create a<br>
ResultsetSTS object, rs. All three objects contain memory management executables that<br>
were generated from the common pre-processor memory management code and pointers<br>
to a common heap as will be discussed in more detail.<br>
[0046] The memory management executables were derived from the common pre-<br>
processor code. For example, object conn contains memory management executables for<br>
MM<connectionabs>::operators new and delete, object stmt contains memory<br>
management executables for MM<statementabs>::operators new and delete, and object<br>
rs contains memory management executables for MM<resultsetabs>: operators new and<br>
delete. All of these memory management executables were derived from the common<br>
pre-processor memory management code as defined by the MM Template depicted in<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
[0047] According to one embodiment, a common heap is shared among the objects,<br>
as will be discussed in more detail. According to one embodiment, the common heap is<br>
shared by passing a pointer into the first instruction of the series of instructions (602, 603,<br>
604) that create objects. For example, pointer pHl is initialized to a common heap at<br>
instruction 601. According to one embodiment, the common heap is shared among<br>
objects without passing a pointer into each instruction of the series of instructions as will<br>
be discussed in more detail. According to another embodiment, the common heap is<br>
shared among objects by passing a pointer into each instruction of the series of<br>
instructions. This would be the case if pHl were present in the invocations of instructions<br>
602, 603, and 604.<br>
[0048] At instruction 601, the application program 600 initializes a pointer to a<br>
common heap. At instruction 602, the application program 600 invokes a global<br>
program, createConnection 610, that: (1) creates a ConnectionSTS object, conn, (2)<br>
returns a pointer to the conn object, and (3) saves a pointer to this common heap in the<br>
newly created conn object.<br>
[0049] For example, the global program, createConnection 610, creates the conn<br>
object at instruction 611. Instruction 611 has two parts: an invocation of<br>
MM<cormectionsts>::new at code fragment 61 la and an invocation of<br>
ConnectionSTS's constructor 500 at code fragment 611b. MM<connectionsts>::new is<br>
a specialized version of MM Template's new operator 230, which allocates memory for<br>
the conn object at instruction 232 and returns a pointer to conn. ConnectionSTS's<br>
constructor 500 "constructs" conn by initializing MM<connectionabs>::hndlp_ 206 at<br><br>
instruction 501 and by optionally initializing other data members at instruction 502.<br>
Since ConnectionSTS Class 400 is a subclass of MM<connectionabs> 401, a specialized<br>
version of the MM Template's Constructor 210 is invoked.<br>
[0050] At instructions 603 and 604, factory methods in objects are used to, among<br>
other things: (1) create other objects, and (2) communicate a pointer to the common heap<br>
to each of these other objects. To create objects, stmt and rs, factory methods,<br>
createStatement method 510 and execQuery method 540, are invoked at instructions 603<br>
and 604 respectively. To communicate a pointer to the common heap, factory methods,<br>
createStatement and execQuery, propagate the pointer from one object to the next created<br>
object. For example, object conn is created at instruction 602 and used to communicate a<br>
common heap pointer to object stmt at instruction 603. This is accomplished by passing<br>
the pointer to the common heap member, pH1, to createConnection 610 at instruction<br>
602. Code fragment 611a results in calling MM<connectionabs>::new. Code fragment<br>
61 lb results in calling the ConnectionsSTS's Constructor 500 where the pointer to the<br>
common heap is also saved in the object conn. ConnectionSTS's Constructor 500 saves<br>
the common heap pointer in MM<connectionabs>::hndlp_ at instruction 501. Then the<br>
saved pointer to the common heap is propagated from object conn to object stmt at<br>
• instruction 603 when the factory method createStatement in conn is used to create object<br>
stmt. For example, at code fragment 51 la, MM<connectionabs>::hdnlp_, which is a<br>
specialized version of hndlp_ 206, is passed into the new operator, which allocates<br>
memory for the stmt object. Similar processing occurs with regards to object rs at<br>
instruction 604.<br>
A HIERARCHICAL TREE OF OBJECTS<br>
[0051] FIG. 7 is a block diagram depicting a set of objects that have a hierarchical<br>
tree relationship to each other (hereinafter referred to as a "hierarchical tree") according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. For example, for any given database<br>
connection, one or more queries are executed involving statements. Resultsets are<br>
returned in response to the queries. Streams are obtained from resultsets in order to<br>
coordinate reading large data objects, such as Binary Large Objects, that cannot be read in<br>
one function call. Therefore, a hierarchical relationship exists between a database<br>
connection, and the related statements, resultsets, and streams. The connection, and<br>
related statements, resultsets, and streams can each be represented by an object and the<br>
objects can be organized in a hierarchical tree that reflects the relationship between the<br>
objects.<br><br>
[0052] For example, Conn_1 is a connection object. Stmt_1, Stmt_2, and Stmt_3 are<br>
statement objects that represent statements used in queries for this connection. RS_1 and<br>
RS_2 are resultset objects that represent resultsets returned in response to a query using<br>
Stmt_l. RS_3 and R8_4 are resultset objects that represent resultsets returned in<br>
response to a query using Stmt_3. Streams, Stream_l and Stream_2, are obtained from<br>
resultsets, RS_1 and RS_4 respectively. Memory (H0, H1, H2, H3, H11, H12, H31, H32,<br>
H111, H321), used for executing methods and for performing computations among other<br>
things, is associated with each object in a hierarchical tree. For example, memory HO is<br>
associated with object Conn_l, memory HI is associated with object Stmt_l, and so on.<br>
MEMORY ASSOCIATED WITH A HIERARCHICAL TREE OF OBJECTS<br>
[0053] FIG. 8 is a block diagram depicting pieces of memory associated with each<br>
object of a set of objects according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
pieces of memory (hereinafter referred to as a hierarchical memory tree) are organized to<br>
reflect the hierarchical tree relationship of the set of objects. According to one<br>
embodiment, FIG. 8 depicts the hierarchical memory tree associated with the set of<br>
objects that are depicted in FIG. 7. For example, HO is one piece of memory associated<br>
with object Conn_l; HI, H2, and H3 are pieces of memory associated with the statement<br>
objects Stmt_l, Stmt_2, and Stmt_3 respectively; HI 1, H12, H31, and H32 are pieces of<br>
memory associated with the resultset objects RS_1, RS_2, RS_3, and RS_4 respectively;<br>
H111 and H321 are pieces memory associated with stream objects Stream_l and<br>
Stream_2.<br>
[0054] According to one embodiment, a heap is one piece of memory associated with<br>
the top object of a hierarchical tree and subheaps of this heap are the pieces of memory<br>
associated with the rest of tire objects. For example in FIG. 7, HO, which is associated<br>
with the top object Conn_l, would be a heap, and the memory associated with the rest of<br>
the objects (HI, H2, H3, etc.) are subheaps of HO.<br>
[0055] Hierarchical data is maintained that determines the hierarchy of the<br>
hierarchical memory tree, and is maintained in such a way that the hierarchical memory<br>
tree reflects the hierarchical relationship between the set of objects in the hierarchical<br>
tree. This data could be among other tilings pointers and references that are maintained:<br>
(1) in data members of the set of objects, (2) in the memory associated with the set of<br>
objects, or (3) in one or more tables.<br>
[0056] By maintaining hierarchical data for the memory that reflects the hierarchical<br>
relationship of the set of objects, a memory subtree can be released with a single request,<br><br>
such as an object destructor or a function, without impacting other objects in the<br>
hierarchical tree or the memory associated with the other objects in the hierarchical tree.<br>
[0057] According to one embodiment, this hierarchical data is a pair of sibling and<br>
children pointers associated with the heap and each subheap in the hierarchical memory<br>
tree. The heap and each subheap points to a list of its own children and its own siblings.<br>
For example, the children of heap HO, which is associated with Conn_l, are subheaps HI,<br>
H2, and H3. The siblings of subheap HI are subheaps H2 and H3.<br>
RELEASING MEMORY ASSOCIATED WITH A MEMORY SUBTREE USING A<br>
SINGLE REQUEST<br>
[0058] FIG. 9, 10A, and 10B are block diagrams depicting classes for creating objects<br>
that have a hierarchical relationship and the memory associated with these objects<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 is a block diagram depicting<br>
class definitions for the connection, statement, and resultset classes. FIGS. 10A and 10B<br>
are block diagrams depicting the methods associated with these classes. In this example,<br>
the classes are used to create connection, statement, and resultset objects. FIG. 11 is a<br>
block diagram depicting programs that create objects with classes depicted in FIGS. 9,<br>
10 A. and 10B according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0059] According to one embodiment, releasing memory associated with a memory<br>
subtree in a single request is performed in conjunction with common memory<br>
management. In this case, the Connection class 900, Statement class 910, and the<br>
Resultset Class 920 would be subclasses of specialized templates. For example, when<br>
Connection class 900 is used to create an object A, the new operator 230 is invoked.<br>
Likewise, when object A is destroyed, a destructor in Connection class 900 (not shown) is<br>
invoked, which in turn invokes the delete operator 240. Then the delete operator 240, or<br>
a function the delete operator 240 invokes, traverses the hierarchical data to release the<br>
memory associated with object A and the subtree associated with object A. For example,<br>
if the destructor for Stmt_l, as depicted in FIG. 7, is invoked from an application<br>
program, the destructor can use the children and sibling pointers, as depicted in FIG. 8, to<br>
determine that subheaps HI, HI 1, H12, HI 11 should be released.<br>
[0060] According to another embodiment, releasing memory associated with a<br>
memory subtree in a single request is performed without common memory management<br>
code. For example, the Connection class 900, Statement class 910, and the Resultset<br>
Class 920 are not subclasses of specialized templates.<br>
[0061] A pointer (906, 916, 923) to memory is associated with each class (900, 910,<br>
920) that is used to create objects in a hierarchical tree. For example, the connection class<br>
900, statement class 910, and the resultset class 920 all have pointers (906, 916, 923) to<br>
either a heap or a subheap. Constructors (1000, 1020, 1040) are used to initialize these<br>
pointers (906, 916, 923) using initialization instructions (1001, 1021, 1041). For<br>
example, connection's constructor 1000, statement's constructor 1020, and resultset's<br>
constructor 1040 initialize their respective memory pointers to point to heaps or subheaps<br>
in initialization instructions 1001, 1021, and 1041. Factory methods (1010, 1030) are<br>
used not only to create new objects of other class types but also to allocate memory for<br>
the newly created objects (1011, 1032) and maintain hierarchical data (907, 908, 917,<br>
918, 924, 925) for the memory that reflects the hierarchical relationship between the set<br>
of objects. For example, connection's createStatement method 1010: (1) creates anew<br>
subheap of the connection object's heap (906) at instruction 1011, (2) creates a statement<br>
object and associates the newly created subheap with the statement object at instruction<br>
1012, and (3) maintains hierarchical data, in the form of children and sibling pointers<br>
(907 and 908), for the subheaps so that the subheaps reflect the hierarchical relationship<br>
between the set of objects at instruction 1013.<br>
[0062] By creating objects in factory methods and maintaining hierarchical data in<br>
either the memory associated with these objects or as data members of the objects<br>
themselves, a subtree and its associated memory can be released with a single request.<br>
An example of maintaining the hierarchical data in the memory has already been<br>
described herein. Assuming that the hierarchical data is maintained as data members in<br>
the objects, a function could use the data members in objects Stmt_l, RS_1, RS_2, and<br>
Stream_l, to determine that subheaps HI, HI 1, H12, HI 11 should be released.<br>
OTHER EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0063] According to another embodiment, all the memory for a hierarchical memory'<br>
tree is in a single piece of contiguous memory, which is subdivided into separate pieces of<br>
memory that are associated with each object in the hierarchical tree. Pointers are used to<br>
maintain the relationship between the pieces of memory associated with the individual<br>
objects. Any known method for maintaining these pointers may be used such as<br>
maintaining the pointers within the single piece of memory itself or maintaining the<br>
pointers in a table.<br><br>
HARDWARE OVERVIEW<br>
[0064] Figure 12 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 1200 upon<br>
which an embodiment of the invention maybe implemented. Computer system 1200<br>
includes a bus 1202 or other communication mechanism for communicating information,<br>
and a processor 1204 coupled with bus 1202 for processing information. Computer<br>
system 1200 also includes a main memory 1206, such as a random access memory<br>
(RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 1202 for storing information and<br>
instructions to be executed by processor 1204. Main memory 1206 also may be used for<br>
storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of<br>
instructions to be executed by processor 1204. Computer system 1200 further includes a<br>
read only memory (ROM) 1208 or other static storage device coupled to bus 1202 for<br>
storing static information and instructions for processor 1204. A storage device 1210,<br>
such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 1202 for storing<br>
information and instructions.<br>
[0065] Computer system 1200 may be coupled via bus 1202 to a display 1212, such<br>
as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input<br>
device 1214, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 1202 for<br>
communicating information and command selections to processor 1204. Another type of<br>
user input device is cursor control 1216, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction<br>
keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 1204<br>
and for controlling cursor movement on display 1212. This input device typically has<br>
two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that<br>
allows the device to specify positions in a plane.<br>
[0066 j The invention is related to the use of computer system 1200 for implementing<br>
the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those<br>
techniques are performed by computer system 1200 in response to processor 1204<br>
executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory<br>
1206. Such instructions may be read into main memory 1206 from another computer-<br>
readable medium, such as storage device 1210. Execution of the sequences of<br>
instructions contained in main memory 1206 causes processor 1204 to perform the<br>
process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be<br>
used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention.<br>
Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of<br>
hardware circuitry and software.<br><br>
[0067] The term "computer-readable medium" as used herein refers to any medium<br>
that participates in providing instructions to processor 1204 for execution. Such a<br>
medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile<br>
media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or<br>
magnetic disks, such as storage device 1210. Volatile media includes dynamic memory,<br>
such as main memory 1206. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire<br>
and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 1202. Transmission media can<br>
also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave<br>
and infra-red data communications.<br>
[0068] Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy<br>
disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-<br>
ROM, any other optical medium, pimchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with<br>
patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory<br>
chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from<br>
which a computer can read.<br>
[0069] Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or<br>
more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 1204 for execution. For<br>
example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote<br>
computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and<br>
send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer<br>
system 1200 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to<br>
convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried<br>
in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 1202. Bus 1202<br>
carries the data to main memory 1206, from which processor 1204 retrieves and executes<br>
the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 1206 may optionally be<br>
stored on storage device 1210 either before or after execution by processor 1204.<br>
[0070] Computer system 1200 also includes a communication interface 1218 coupled<br>
to bus 1202. Communication interface 1218 provides a two-way data communication<br>
coupling to a network link 1220 that is connected to a local network 1222. For example,<br>
communication interface 1218 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card<br>
or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of<br>
telephone line. As another example, communication interface 1218 maybe a local area<br>
network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN.<br>
Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, commumcation<br>
interface 1218 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry<br>
digital data streams representing various types of information.<br>
[0071] Network link 1220 typically provides data communication through one or<br>
more networks to other data devices. For example, network link 1220 may provide a<br>
connection through local network 1222 to a host computer 1224 or to data equipment<br>
operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 1226. ISP 1226 in turn provides data<br>
communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now<br>
commonly referred to as the "Internet" 1228. Local network 1222 and Internet 1228 both<br>
use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The<br>
signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 1220 and through<br>
communication interface 1218, winch carry the digital data to and from computer system<br>
1200, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.<br>
[0072] Computer system 1200 can send messages and receive data, including<br>
program code, through the network(s), network link 1220 and communication interface<br>
1218. In the Internet example, a server 1230 might transmit a requested code for an<br>
application program through Internet 1228, ISP 1226, local network 1222 and<br>
communication interface 1218.<br>
[0073] The received code may be executed by processor 1204 as it is received, and/or<br>
stored in storage device 1210, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this<br>
manner, computer system 1200 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.<br>
[0074] In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference<br>
to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications<br>
and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an<br>
illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.<br><br>
