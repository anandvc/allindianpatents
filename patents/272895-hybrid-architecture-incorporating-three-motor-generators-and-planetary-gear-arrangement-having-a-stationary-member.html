HYBRID -ARCHITECTURE INCORPORATING THREE MOTOR GENERATORS AND PLANETARY GEAR ARRANGMENT HAVING A STATIONARY MEMBER<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/729,191, filed October 21st, 2005, and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to electrically variable transmissions having<br>
three planetary gear sets and three motor/generators that are controllable to provide continuously variable speed ratio ranges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Electric hybrid vehicles offer the potential for significant fuel economy<br>
improvements over their conventional counterparts; however, their overall efficiency is limited by parasitic losses. In single-mode electric variable transmissions (EVT) these losses are mostly attributed to electric machines rotating at high speeds. Two-mode EVTs offer the advantage of reduced motor-generator speeds, but often suffer losses attributed to high-pressure hydraulic pump and clutches needed for mode switching. Significant vehicle fuel economy gains can be realized if the losses associated with high-pressure hydraulic pump, clutches and high motor-generator speeds are substantially eliminated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	This    invention    describes   continuously-variable    mechatronic   hybrid<br>
transmissions that offer the advantages of multi-mode EVTs without the need for clutches and the associated high pressure hydraulic pump.<br>
 <br>
 2<br>
[0004]	The electrically variable transmission family of the present invention<br>
provides low-content, low-cost electrically variable transmission mechanisms including<br>
first, second and third differential gear sets; a battery (or similar energy storage device)<br>
and three electric machines serving interchangeably as motors or generators.  Preferably,<br>
the differential gear sets are planetary gear sets, but other gear arrangements may be<br>
implemented, such as bevel gears or differential gearing to an offset axis.<br>
[0005]	In this description, the first, second and third planetary gear sets may be<br>
counted first to third in any order (i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.).<br>
[0006]	Each of the three planetary gear sets has three members. The first, second<br>
or third member of each planetary gear set can be any one of a sun gear, ring gear or<br>
carrier, or alternatively a pinion.<br>
[0007]	Each carrier can be either a single-pinion carrier (simple) or a double-<br>
pinion carrier (compound).<br>
[0008]	The input shaft is continuously connected with a member of the planetary<br>
gear sets.    The output shaft is continuously connected with another member of the<br>
planetary gear sets.<br>
[0009]	A first interconnecting member continuously connects the first member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the first member of the second planetary gear.<br>
[0010]	A  second  interconnecting  member  continuously  connects  the  second<br>
member of the second planetary gear set with a first member of the third planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
[0011]	A   third   interconnecting   member   continuously   connects   the   second<br>
member   of the   first   planetary   gear   set  with   a  stationary  member  (transmission<br>
housing/ground).<br>
[0012]	A first motor/generator is connected to a member of the first or second<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0013]	A second motor/generator is connected to a member of the second or third<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0014]	A third motor/generator is connected to a member of the first or third<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
[0015]	In essence, the planetary gear arrangement has six nodes, five of which are<br>
connected with the input shaft, output shaft and three motor/generators. The electric motor/generators are connected with drive units, control system and energy storage devices, such as a battery.<br>
[0016]	The three motor/generators are operated in a coordinated fashion to yield<br>
continuously variable forward and reverse speed ratios between the input shaft and the output shaft, while minimizing the rotational speeds of the motor-generators and optimizing the overall efficiency of the system. The tooth ratios of the, planetary gear sets can be suitably selected to match specific applications.<br>
[0017]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0030]	With reference to Figure 1, a powertrain 10 is shown, including an engine<br>
12   connected  to  one  preferred  embodiment  of the  improved  electrically  variable<br>
transmission  (EVT), designated generally by the numeral   14.     Transmission  14 is<br>
designed to receive at least a portion of its driving power from the engine 12. As shown.<br>
the engine 12 has an output shaft that serves as the input member 17 of the transmission<br>
14.   A transient torque damper (not shown) may also be implemented between the engine<br>
12 and the input member 17 of the transmission.<br>
[0031]	In the embodiment depicted the engine 12 may be a fossil fuel engine,<br>
such as a gasoline or diesel engine which is readily adapted to provide its available power<br>
output typically delivered at a selectable number of revolutions per minute (RPM).<br>
[0032]	Irrespective of the means by which the engine 12 is connected to the<br>
transmission   input  member   17,  the  transmission input  member   17   is  operatively<br>
connected to a planetary gear set in the transmission 14.<br>
[0033]	An output member 19 of the transmission 14 is connected to a final<br>
drive 16.<br>
[0034]	The transmission 14 utilizes three differential gear sets, preferably in the<br>
nature of planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40.   The planetary gear set 20 employs an outer<br>
 <br>
5<br>
gear member 24, typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 24 circumscribes an inner gear member 22, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 26 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 27 such that each planet gear 27 simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 24 and the inner, sun gear member 22 of the first planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0035]	The planetary gear set 30 also employs an outer gear member 34, typically<br>
designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 34 circumscribes an inner gear member 32, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 36 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 37 such that each planet gear 37 simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 34 and the inner, sun gear member 32 of the planetary gear set 30.<br>
[0036]	The planetary gear set 40 also employs an outer gear member 44, typically<br>
designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 44 circumscribes an inner gear member 42, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 46 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 47 such that each planet gear 47 simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 44 and the inner, sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0037]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected to the sun gear member 32 of<br>
the planetary gear set 30. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected to the ring gear member 44 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0038]	A first interconnecting member 70 continuously connects the ring gear<br>
member 24 of the planetary gear set 20 with the carrier member 36 of the planetary gear<br>
set 20. A second interconnecting member 72 continuously connects the ring gear<br>
member 34 of the planetary gear set 30 with the sun gear member 42 of the planetary<br>
gear set 40. A third interconnecting member 74 continuously connects the sun gear<br>
member 22 of the planetary gear set 20 with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0039]	The first preferred embodiment 10 also incorporates first, second and third<br>
motor/generators 80, 82 and 84, respectively. The stator of the first motor/generator 80 is secured to the transmission housing 60. The rotor of the first motor/generator 80 is secured to the carrier member 26 of the planetary gear set 20.<br>
 <br>
6<br>
[0040]	The stator of the second motor/generator 82 is secured to the transmission<br>
housing 60.    The rotor of the second motor/generator 82 is secured to the ring gear member 24 of the planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0041]	The stator of the third motor/generator 84 is secured to the transmission<br>
housing 60. The rotor of the third motor/generator 84 is secured to the carrier member 46 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0042]	Returning now to the description of the power sources, it should be<br>
apparent from the foregoing description, and with particular reference to Figure 1, that the transmission 14 selectively receives power from the engine 12. The hybrid transmission also receives power from an electric power source 86, which is operably connected to a controller 88. The electric power source 86 may be one or more batteries. Other electric power sources, such as capacitors or fuel cells, that have the ability to provide, or store, and dispense electric power may be used in place of or in combination with batteries without altering the concepts of the present invention. The speed ratio between the input shaft and output shaft is prescribed by the speeds of the three motor/generators and the ring gear / sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets. Those with ordinary skill in the transmission art will recognize that desired input/output speed ratios can be realized by suitable selection of the speeds of the three motor/generators.<br>
