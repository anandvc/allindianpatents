BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
A method is described for making a replication-<br>
defective HIV virus particle. The present invention is<br>
also directed to a HIV virus particle produced according to<br>
the method and to a vaccine including the particle.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A variety of strategies have evolved in the<br>
pursuit of an effective HIV vaccine. One strategy is the<br>
use of attenuated viruses. Recent advances in SIV vaccine<br>
studies indicate that live attenuated vaccines provide the<br>
best protection against challenge with the pathogenic<br>
strain of SIV in vaccinated animals (Clements J.E. et al.,<br>
Journal of Virology 69 (1995): 2737-2744; Daniel, M.D. et<br>
al., Science 258 (1992): 1938-1941; Stahl-Hennig C. et al.,<br>
Journal of General Virology 77 (1996) : 2969-2981; Norley,<br>
S. et al., Journal of Virology 219 (1996): 195-205; Almond,<br>
N. et al., The Lancet 345 (1995): 1342-1344; Wyand, M.S. et<br>
al., Journal of Virology 70 (1996): 3724-3733). This<br>
animal model suggests that the protective immunity can be<br>
elicited by vaccination with attenuated viruses. However,<br>
there is a potential risk in using an attenuated virus as<br>
a vaccine in humans. This concern is strengthened by<br>
studies in which attenuated viruses are shown to cause<br>
disease in neonatal rhesus monkeys (Wyand, M.S. et al.,<br>
Nature Medicine 3 (1997): 32-36; Baba, T.W. et al., Science<br>
267 (1995): 1820-1825) and, further, by the high rate of<br>
reversion of some attenuated SIV strains inoculated in<br>
monkeys (Cohen, J., Science 278 (1997): 24-25).<br>
Humoral and cellular immune responses can be<br>
elicited in rhesus monkeys inoculated with a naked DNA<br>
vaccine. However, there is little or no protective<br>
immunity observed in vaccinated animals after challenge<br><br>
with SIV (Lu, S. et al., Journal of Virology 70 (1996):<br>
3978-3991) . The mechanisms of protective immunity elicited<br>
by attenuated live vaccines in vaccinated animals have not<br>
been identified. Protective immunity may be due to the<br>
continuous expression of viral proteins from the persisting<br>
viral genome in the vaccinated monkeys, to the expression<br>
of all (or part of) the SIV proteins from endogenous<br>
pathways, or to other aspects (e.g., viral replication<br>
site) of the immune response to the live, attenuated virus.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,571,712, to Haynes et<br>
al. discloses replication-defective HIV virus particles<br>
which do not include retroviral RNA. These retroviral<br>
particles are acceptable for safety reasons due to their<br>
inability to replicate. However, these particles differ<br>
from vaccines capable of replication in their lesser<br>
ability to elicit protective immunity. Thus, it is<br>
expected that larger numbers of particles must be<br>
administered to a subject in a course of vaccination.<br>
Further, lack of expression of viral proteins in a<br>
vaccinated subject will affect the quality of the<br>
protective immunity.<br>
Other vaccines are currently under development,<br>
which include peptide vaccines, DNA vaccines, multi-valent<br>
virus (i.e., recombinant canarypox vaccines) and<br>
combination vaccines (i.e., a DNA vaccine combined with a<br>
fowlpox booster, vaccine) with varying results. (Gold, D.,<br>
IAVI Report 3 (1998): 1+.)<br>
The efficacy of HIV vaccines is, generally,<br>
difficult to evaluate due to the lack of readily accessible<br>
animal models (Girard, M. et al., Virology 232 (1997): 98-<br>
104). Therefore, it is most desirable to have a<br>
replication-defective virus particle with broad tropism,<br>
both with regard to range of species it will infect and<br>
with regard to the cell types it will infect in a given<br>
subject. It is also highly desirable to have a<br>
replication-defective virus particle which can produce<br>
antigenic HIV proteins in levels and for a duration<br>
suitable to elicit a protective immune response, with both<br>
cellular and humoral components. These goals have been<br>
achieved in the present invention, a replication-defective<br>
HIV vaccine pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G<br>
(VSV-G) protein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method is provided for producing a replication-<br>
defective retrovirus particle, including the steps of<br>
providing a DNA molecule which includes a complete<br>
retroviral genome; modifying a portion of the pol gene of<br>
the DNA molecule including the protease and reverse<br>
transcriptase activity coding regions to the extent that<br>
the remaining pol gene cannot produce a protease and<br>
reverse transcriptase capable of functioning in replication<br>
of the genome, thereby forming a pol- construct;<br>
transferring the pol- construct into a suitable host cell;<br>
prior to, during or after the step of transferring the pol-<br>
construct into the host cell, transferring into the host<br>
cell a pseudotyping construct and a packaging construct;<br>
growing the host cell under conditions suitable for<br>
expression of the constructs and for production of<br>
replication-defective retrovirus particles; and collecting<br>
the virus particles.<br>
The retroviral genome is preferably an HIV virus<br>
genome and most preferably an HIV-1 genome. In one<br>
embodiment, the pol- construct is plasmid pHXB2 with<br>
nucleotides 2621-4552 deleted. The method may further<br>
include the step of modifying the retroviral genome to<br>
represent protein sequence variations in immunologically<br>
variant retroviruses.<br>
The pseudotyping construct is preferably a<br>
construct for expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus G<br>
protein. The pol- construct, the packaging construct and<br>
the pseudotyping construct may be co-transfected or,<br>
alternately, at least one of the pseudotyping construct and<br>
the packaging construct are carried stably in the genome of<br>
the host cell.<br>
The present invention further includes a<br>
replication-defective retrovirus particle, including a<br>
retroviral genome in which a portion of the pol gene<br>
including the protease and reverse transcriptase activity<br>
coding regions is modified to the extent that the remaining<br>
pol gene cannot produce a protease and reverse<br>
transcriptase capable of functioning in replication of the<br>
genome. As described above in connection with the method<br>
embodiment, the retroviral genome can be an HIV genome and,<br>
preferably, an HIV-1 genome. In one embodiment, the<br>
retroviral genome is a pol- construct that is derived from<br>
plasmid pHXB2 with nucleotides 2621-4552 thereof deleted.<br>
The pseudotyping protein may be the vesicular stomatitis<br>
virus G protein.<br>
The present invention further includes a vaccine<br>
including the above-described virus particle in its<br>
variously described embodiment in combination with a<br>
pharmaceutically and/or veterinarilly suitable excipient.<br>
The excipient can include mono-, di-, oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides, viscosity enhancing and/or tackifying<br>
agents, polymers, block polymers and cross-linked polymers.<br>
The vaccine can be lyophilized for use in reconstituted<br>
form or in immunization by scarification. Further, the<br>
vaccine can be formulated into a form selected from the<br>
group consisting of an oral liquid, an oral capsule, a<br>
liquid for parenteral injection, a transdermal or<br>
transmucosal device and a suppository and includes a<br>
suitable excipient for preparation of the selected form.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is a method for producing<br>
a replication-defective HIV virus particle, a virus<br>
particle prepared according to the method and to a vaccine<br>
including the virus particles. The virus particles exhibit<br>
increased ability to produce antigen, expanded cell tropism<br>
and the ability to elicit strong humoral and cellular<br>
immunity. As a result of the expanded tropism, the virus<br>
particles can infect rhesus monkeys in a single cycle of<br>
replication. Thus, the protective immunity can be further<br>
evaluated in rhesus monkeys by challenge with an SIV/HIV<br>
chimera virus (SHIV).<br>
The method of the present invention is a method<br>
for preparing a replication-defective retroviral particle<br>
including the steps of 1) preparing a DNA molecule which<br>
includes a complete retroviral genome; 2) modifying a<br>
portion of the pol gene including the protease and reverse<br>
transcriptase coding regions, to the extent that the<br>
remaining pol gene cannot produce a protease and reverse<br>
transcriptase capable of functioning in replication of the<br>
genome (the pol- construct); 3) transferring the pol-<br>
construct into a suitable host cell prior to, along with or<br>
after the step of transferring a pseudotyping construct and<br>
a packaging construct into the host cell or a predecessor<br>
cell or a progeny cell thereof; 4) growing the host cell<br>
under conditions suitable for expression of the constructs<br>
and for production of the replication-defective retrovirus<br>
particle; and 5) collecting the virus particles.<br>
The DNA molecule can be prepared from any DNA<br>
containing a complete retroviral genome. In theory, a<br>
genome suitable for preparing the pol- construct is any<br>
substantially complete retroviral genome which is intact,<br>
and encodes and is capable of expressing all viral proteins<br>
other than those inactivated by the described modification<br>
of the pol gene, whether or not one or more of the viral<br>
proteins are modified or unmodified as compared to the<br>
wild-type retrovirus. It later may be found that<br>
expression of certain viral proteins (non-pol proteins) are<br>
unnecessary to elicit protective immunity. A genome having<br>
these viral proteins modified or deleted could be a<br>
suitable genome for modification according to the methods<br>
of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, the pol gene<br>
of the retroviral genome is modified to cause the protease<br>
and the reverse transcriptase functions of the pol gene to<br>
lose their viral replication-associated functionality.<br>
This loss of function can be induced by a variety of<br>
methods, including: by insertions of amino acids, by<br>
replacement of amino acids and by deletions of amino acids.<br>
Preferably, a significant portion of the pol gene is<br>
deleted, as in the example, below.<br>
The packaging construct can be any construct<br>
which provides in trans all functions missing from the pol-<br>
construct to allow packaging of the pol- genome into a<br>
replication-defective viral particle which, when<br>
transduced, can achieve one round of viral replication.<br>
The packaging construct will at least encode a complete and<br>
functional reverse transcriptase for incorporation into the<br>
replication-defective virus particles and to copy the pol-<br>
genome into DNA once the replication-defective virus<br>
particle infects a target cell.<br>
The pseudotyping construct is, preferably, a<br>
recombinant construct for expressing the VSV-G protein.<br>
Expression of the protein is under transcriptional control<br>
of a suitable promoter. In the example below, the common<br>
constitutive CMV promoter is used. Other promoters,<br>
whether inducible or constitutive, are suitable so long as<br>
the construct encodes the VSV-G protein. Alternative<br>
pseudotyping proteins may be encoded by and expressed by<br>
the pseudotyping construct. An example of an alternative<br>
tropism-modifying protein is the Murine Leukemia Virus<br>
(MLV) envelope protein. The appropriate pseudotyping<br>
protein can be selected according to the application of the<br>
vaccine. The VSV-G protein is an appropriate pseudotyping<br>
protein for human or simian applications. Different<br>
pseudotyping proteins are appropriate for specific<br>
veterinary applications, such as if the virus particle is<br>
to serve as a Feline Leukemia Virus vaccine.<br>
The host cell for production of replication-<br>
defective retrovirus particles can be virtually any<br>
mammalian cell so long as the cell is capable of producing<br>
infectious virus particles according to the methods<br>
described herein. In the examples described below, the<br>
preferred, and widely available, 293 cells (human<br>
transformed embryonal kidney cells; ATCC CRL-1573, American<br>
Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville,<br>
MD, U.S.A. 20852) are used as host cells to produce the<br>
HIV pol- particles. This cell line is particularly useful<br>
due to its ease of growth, its rapid growth characteristics<br>
and its ease of transformation by standard protocols.<br>
Cells with similar characteristics are particularly suited<br>
as host cells for preparation of the replication-defective<br>
retrovirus particles.<br>
The example provided below utilizes a three<br>
component transfection to produce virus particles. In the<br>
example, a first plasmid contains a DNA fragment<br>
corresponding to the pol" HIV genome ("the HIVpol-<br>
construct"). A second plasmid provides suitable functions<br>
in trans which are necessary for production of complete<br>
retroviral virus particles (the packaging construct). A<br>
third plasmid provides the genetic material for expression<br>
of the VSV-G protein (a VSV G-encoding or pseudotyping<br>
construct). Transfection of the host cell can be<br>
accomplished by a variety of methods, including, without<br>
limitation: calcium phosphate, liposome and electroporation<br>
methods. Virtually any transfection method is suitable, so<br>
long as the functionality of each construct is maintained.<br>
Further, transfer of the constructs into the host cell can<br>
be accomplished simultaneously, or in any desired order.<br>
It should be noted that, although the examples<br>
herein utilize plasmid DNA to provide the three constructs,<br>
other equivalent vector systems may be utilized to transfer<br>
the constructs to the host cell, including, for example and<br>
without limitation: linear DNA fragments, plasmids and<br>
other recombinant DNA vectors and recombinant virus genomes<br>
or particles. In the case of recombinant virus particles,<br>
the method for transferring the constructs to the host cell<br>
is by transduction with the virus particles. For instance,<br>
virus particles including the transfer vectors described in<br>
Naldini et al., Science 272 (1996): 263-267 would be<br>
suitable for delivery of one or both of the packaging<br>
construct and the VSV-G-encoding construct. Further, the<br>
replication-defective HIV virus particles of the present<br>
invention can be used as a suitable source of the particles<br>
to transduce the HIV pol- construct.<br>
Further, a host cell may be established having<br>
one or both of the packaging construct and the pseudotyping<br>
construct integrated permanently into the host cell DNA.<br>
Packaging cell lines for retroviruses are well known in the<br>
art. (Delwart, E.L. et al., Aids Research and Human<br>
Retroviruses 8 (1992): 1669-1677). The integrated<br>
packaging construct and pseudotyping construct may be under<br>
the control of a constitutive promoter such as the<br>
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, as described in the<br>
examples, or under the control of an inducible promoter,<br>
allowing exact control of virus production and preventing<br>
interference with host cell growth during passage of the<br>
packaging cell line. Transfection inefficiencies are<br>
lessened by the integration of one or more of the<br>
constructs into the host cell genome.<br>
Virus particles prepared according to the above-<br>
described method include all components of a wild-type<br>
virus particle with the exception that the particles<br>
include, at least, the above-described modified (pol-<br>
retroviral) genome, as opposed to the wild-type RNA genome.<br>
Further, the virus particles preferably include the VSV-G<br>
(pseudotyping) protein in order to alter the tropism of the<br>
virus particles. Virus particles are prepared according to<br>
the above-described methods and are, then, collected by<br>
standard methodology. In the example provided herein, the<br>
virus particles are purified by sucrose gradient<br>
ultracentrifugation. Other methods for purification can be<br>
employed, such as affinity chromatography, so long as the<br>
method enables concentrate of the titer of the infectious<br>
replication-defective virus particles.<br>
In use, the replication-defective HIV virus<br>
particles are formulated as a vaccine. The only limitation<br>
is that the vaccine includes, in addition to the virus<br>
particles a pharmaceutically or veterinarilly acceptable<br>
excipient, which can include, without limitation: virus<br>
stabilizing compounds (i.e., sugars such as sucrose or<br>
other saccharides or polysaccharides); buffer systems<br>
(i.e., TNE or its equivalents); antibiotic compounds (i.e.,<br>
bacteriocides, bacteriostatic agents and fungicides);<br>
viscosity enhancing agents (i.e., polyethylene glycol);<br>
polymeric materials (i.e., polymers, copolymers, block<br>
polymers and cross-linked polymers) for use as viscosity<br>
enhancing agents, as tackifying agents or as a matrix or<br>
reservoir for harboring the particles; tackifying agents<br>
which promote adhesion of the vaccine mixture to the skin<br>
or mucosa; viral transduction-enhancing agents; penetration<br>
enhancing agents; flavoring agents; coloring agents;<br>
adsorption enhancing agents and adjuvants. For example, as<br>
shown below, mice were immunized with virus particles in<br>
tissue culture media, which served as a suitable excipient.<br>
The vaccine can be prepared in many forms (and<br>
with an excipient suitable for each form), such as, without<br>
limitation: an oral liquid for either swallowing or for<br>
application to a surface of the mouth, including sublingual<br>
or buccal application; an oral capsule or tablet; a liquid<br>
for parenteral injection; a cream or ointment for topical<br>
application; a lyophilized product for reconstitution or<br>
for vaccination by scarification; a transdermal<br>
preparation; and a liquid or a suppository for rectal or<br>
intravaginal application. A "lyophilized product" is<br>
understood to include virus particles freeze-dried,<br>
lyophilized or vitrified in the presence of a suitable<br>
buffer system, such as TNE, and a suitable carrier, such as<br>
a sugar (i.e., trehalose or sucrose), a polysaccharide, or<br>
other compounds suitable for stabilizing labile biological<br>
compounds.<br>
The vaccine can also contain two or more pol~<br>
variants of the same retrovirus. Therefore, a subject can<br>
be immunized once or multiple times with two or more<br>
variants of the virus which reflect common antigenic<br>
variations of HIV. Production of a variant virus would be<br>
straight-forward once the nucleotide sequence of the<br>
variant HIV is known. Appropriate modification of DNA<br>
encoding the replication-defective genome would be<br>
accomplished through well known cloning and mutagenesis<br>
methods.<br>

313 (1985): 277-284, GeneBank No. K03455). The resulting<br>
plasmid is called pHIVpol". A helper expression vector<br>
(pCMVAR8.2) encoding HIV-1 gag and pol genes was obtained.<br>
The packaging sequence (?) and long terminal repeat (LTR)<br>
of HIV-1 were deleted from this expression vector.<br>
Therefore, the viral RNA transcribed from this expression<br>
vector cannot be packaged into viral particles.<br>
Plasmid pCMVAR8.2 was constructed from an<br>
infectious molecular clone of proviral HIV-1, pR9 (D.<br>
Trono, M.B. Feinberg, D. Baltimore, Cell 59, 113, 1989).<br>
A 1.3 K base pair BgIII fragment (6308-7611) was deleted<br>
from the envelope gene. A 39 base pair internal deletion<br>
in the packaging signal sequence was introduced (A. Lever<br>
et al., Journal of Virology 63 (1989): 4085), and the 3'HIV<br>
long terminal repeat (LTR) was replaced with poly-A site of<br>
insulin genomic DNA. The 5'LTR and leader sequence of HIV<br>
were substituted with a 0.8 K base pair fragment containing<br>
the CMV promoter (Naldini, Science 272 (1996): 263-268)<br>
A VSV-G protein expression construct (pCMV.VSV.G)<br>
was obtained. Plasmid pCMV.VSV.G was constructed by<br>
inserting a 1.7k base pair fragment encoding the VSV.G<br>
protein (GeneBank No. X03633) into the BamHI site of<br>
pCMVneo.<br>
The pseudotyped virus was produced by co-<br>
transfecting these three plasmids into a highly<br>
transfectable cell line 293T, as shown in Fig. 1. About 106<br>
293T cells were transfected with 5 µq of each plasmid by<br>
the calcium phosphate method. Seventy-two hours after<br>
transfection, cell-free virus supernatant ("HIVpol"/VSV-G")<br>
was harvested and stored at -80°C. Some viruses were<br>
concentrated by sucrose density gradient<br>
ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 2 hours and were<br>
resuspended into TNE buffer (50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.8, 130 mM<br>
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The viral titer was determined on MAGI<br>
and sMAGI cells as described. In brief, cells were<br>
transduced with serial dilutions of viruses and stained<br>
with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-li-D-galactopyranoside (X-<br>
Gal) after 3 days of incubation.<br>
2. Transduction of sMAGI cell line.<br>
An indicator cell line, sMAGI (Chackerian, B. et<br>
al., Journal of Virology 71 (1997): 3932-3939), was used<br>
for the transduction assays. sMAGI cells are derived from<br>
macaque mammary tumor cells. They express human CD4 and<br>
encode an HIV LTR fused to the (3-galactosidase ((3-Gal)<br>
reporter gene. This cell line allows detection of<br>
productive infection by a single virus particle by<br>
exploiting the ability of the SIV or HIV Tat protein to<br>
transactivate the 3-Gal gene through the HIV LTR promoter.<br>
sMAGI cells were transduced with one ml of 1:1 medium-<br>
diluted virions in the presence of 8 µg/ml of polybrene.<br>
Transduced cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C before<br>
X-Gal staining.<br>
3. Immunoprecipitation.<br>
Approximately 106 293T cells were transduced with<br>
105 transducing units/ml HIVpol7VSV-G. Forty-eight hours<br>
later, transduced cells were labeled with 35S methionine for<br>
16 hours. A cellular lysate of transduced cells was<br>
immunoprecipitated with anti-HIV serum from AIDS patients.<br>
For analysis of pseudotyped virus particles, 106 293T cells<br>
were transfected with three plasmids (pHIVpol", pCMVAR8.2,<br>
and pVSV-G) or two plasmids (without pVSV-G). Twenty-four<br>
hours later, transfected cells were labeled with 35S<br>
methionine for 16-24 hours. The cell-free medium was then<br>
immunoprecipitated with anti-HIV serum.<br>
4. PCR analysis.<br>
Total DNA was extracted from about 105 CEM174<br>
cells transduced with 1 ml of cell-free virus and subjected<br>
to PCR analysis of the pol gene with primers P1 and P3<br>
(see Fig. 1). To monitor the replication-competent virus<br>
in the virus preparation, the cell-free medium harvested<br>
from one week culture of the transduced CEM17 4 cells was<br>
used to culture CEM174 cells again for another week. The<br>
total DNA was isolated from the second CEM174 cell culture<br>
and was subjected to a sensitive nested PCR analysis of pol<br>
gene with primers PI and P2 (Tung, F. T., Serodiagnosis and<br>
Immunotherapy 6 (1994): 218-220).<br>
5. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay.<br>
Immortalized B cells from HIV infected<br>
individuals were transduced with HIVpol"/VSV-G at MOI = 0.1<br>
and used as target cells in a standard chromium release<br>
assay (Rinaldo, C. et al., Journal of Virology 69 (1995):<br>
5838-5842). B cells infected with vaccinia virus vectors<br>
(MOI= 5) expressing HIV-1 proteins were used as a control.<br>
Different ratios of effector cells were added to 104 B cells<br>
for each assay.<br>
6. Immunization of mice.<br>
BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with<br>
0.1 ml (approximately 20ng of p24) of cell-free pseudotyped<br>
viral supernatant (titer of 105 transducing units TU/ml) at<br>
7-10 day intervals for a total of 5 times. Sera were<br>
collected (retro-orbital venous plexus during Metophane-<br>
induced anesthesia) and tested (1:100 dilution) using an<br>
HIV-1 Western blot kit (BioRad, CA). Prebleed mouse sera<br>
and HIV seropositive sera were used as controls. Alkaline<br>
phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO) was used as the second antibody for mouse serum<br>
samples. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human<br>
antibody (included in the kit) was used as the second<br>
antibody for positive control.<br>
B. Results<br>
1. Construction of plasmid pHIVpol".<br>
pHIVpol" was constructed by deleting a 1.9 kb Ball<br>
fragment of the pol gene of an HIV-1 genome and was self-<br>
ligated by T4 ligase. pHIVpol" encodes all HIV-1 genes<br>
including a truncated pol gene. This construct cannot<br>
generate infectious viruses when transfected into CEM174<br>
cells (data not shown).<br>
2. Production of replication-defective HIV.<br>
Cell-free virus stocks were produced by co-<br>
transfecting three plasmids (or without pVSV-G) into a<br>
highly transfectable cell line 293T (Fig. 1). The cell-<br>
free viruses were then used to transduce sMAGI cells to<br>
assess virus infectivity. The sMAGI cells can only be<br>
infected with SIV; none of the HIV-1 strains (macrophage<br>
or T-cell tropic) tested to date can establish productive<br>
infection (data not shown) (Chackerian, B. : 3932-3939).<br>
The HIVpol"/VSV-G produced from co-transfection of the three<br>
plasmids can infect sMAGI, as shown in Figs. 2A-C. When<br>
any one of the three plasmids was omitted in co-<br>
transfection to produce pseudotyped virus, no productive<br>
infection was established in sMAGI cells (data not shown).<br>
3. The titer of HIVpol"/VSV-G can be concentrated by<br>
ultracentrifugation.<br>
The titer of HIVpol"/VSV-G was determined on<br>
sMAGI and MAGI cells (Table 1). Like sMAGI cells, MAGI<br>
cells were derived from human HeLa CD4 cells encoding an<br>
LTR-driven fi-gal gene (Kimpton, J. et al., Journal of<br>
Virology 66 (1992): 2232-2239). A viral titer of 2-4xl05<br>
transduction units/ml, which is higher than that of HIV-1<br>
cultured in CEM cells, can be prepared routinely from<br>
transient transfected cells without concentration. Virus<br>
particles can be concentrated by sucrose density gradient<br>
ultracentrifugation without losing infectivity (&gt;95%<br>
recovery). The virus was quite stable even after two<br>
freeze-thaw cycles.<br>
4. The formation of pseudotyped viral particles.<br>
To confirm the formation of pseudotyped virus,<br>
the HIVpol-/VSV-G pseudotyped viral particles were analyzed<br>
by immunoprecipitation. About 106 293T cells were co-<br>
transfected with the three plasmids (or without pVSV-G).<br>
The transfected cells were labeled with 35S methionine for<br>
24 hours. Cell-free medium was immunoprecipitated with<br>
anti-serum from an AIDS patient. The results indicated<br>
that both the HIV-1 gag and env were precipitated with<br>
anti-HIV-1 antiserum in pseudotyped and non-pseudotyped<br>
viruses (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of VSV-G<br>
protein, fewer env proteins were precipitated, suggesting<br>
that VSV-G protein is competing with env for incorporation<br>
into the pseudotyped viruses.<br>
5. Transduction of HIVpol"/VSV-G into CD4 and non-CD4<br>
cells.<br>
To confirm that HIVpol"/VSV-G can express HIV-1<br>
genes in transduced cell lines, HeLa-CD4 clone 1022 (CD4+)<br>
and 293T(CD4_) cells were transduced with HIVpolWSV-G.<br>
Significant numbers of multinuclear syncytia were observed<br>
in HeLa-CD4 clone 1022 cells 48 hours after transduction<br>
with HIVpol"/VSV-G (data not shown), suggesting a high level<br>
of env expression. The expression of HIVpol"/VSV-G<br>
transduced HIV genes was further analyzed by<br>
immunoprecipitation in 293T cells. The results indicated<br>
that gag (p50, precursor Gag) and env (gpl60/120) proteins<br>
were detected in the pseudotyped virus-transduced 293T<br>
cells (Fig. 4). The gag cannot be processed into p24 and<br>
pl7 because no viral protease activity is present in the<br>
HIVpolWSV-G transduced 293T cells.<br>
6. PCR analysis of transduced cells and replication-<br>
competent virus.<br>
To further verify the presence of HIV-1 genes in<br>
the pseudotyped virus-transduced cells, PCR analysis of<br>
total DNA isolated from HIVpol'/VSV-G transduced CEM174<br>
cells was positive for the truncated pol gene (Fig. 5A).<br>
A 0.7 kb PCR fragment indicated the cells were transduced<br>
with the pol deletion virus. To demonstrate the absence of<br>
replication-competent virus in the pseudotyped virus<br>
preparation, cell-free culture medium from a one-week<br>
culture of the transduced CEM174 cells was used to culture<br>
CEM174 cells for another week. The two-week culture medium<br>
was checked for p24 and for reverse transcriptase activity.<br>
The results indicated no viral activity in the two-week<br>
culture medium. The CEM174 cells from the two-week culture<br>
were also checked for provirus sequence by a sensitive<br>
nested PCR. This nested PCR can detect less than 10 copies<br>
of provirus. The results indicated that no provirus was<br>
detected in the second round of infection, suggesting no<br>
replication-competent virus in the viral preparation (Fig.<br>
5B).<br>
7. HIV pseudotyped virus transduced B cells can<br>
function as target cells for cytotoxic T lymphocytes.<br>
To check the HIV-1 protein expression in<br>
pseudotyped virus transduced primary cells, immortalized B<br>
cells from AIDS patients were transduced with HIVpol"/VSV-G<br>
and were used as target cells in a standard chromium<br>
release assay. Autologous T cells recognized and lysed the<br>
HIVpolVVSV-G transduced B cells with an efficiency equal to<br>
(or better than) B cells infected with vaccinia vectors<br>
expressing HIV-1 genes (Fig. 6). Thirty percent specific<br>
lysis was observed at the effector-to-target cell ratio of<br>
20:1. These data suggest that the HIV-1 protein can be<br>
expressed and processed normally in transduced primary B<br>
cells.<br>
8. Antibody responses in immunized mice.<br>
To demonstrate the immunogenicity of pseudotyped<br>
viruses, BALB/c mice were immunized with cell-free viruses<br>
and antibody responses were checked by Western blot. The<br>
results indicated that weak but clearly visible bands<br>
appeared in Western blot assay (Fig. 7). Three major viral<br>
proteins (p24, p50 and gpl60) were detected two months<br>
after immunization. Prebleed sera were negative. These<br>
data indicated that cell-free viral supernatant is<br>
immunogenic in the vaccinated mice.<br>
Lyophilization<br>
Cell-free virus supernatant (HIVpol-/VSV-G) was<br>
prepared as described above, in 293T cells in DMEM with 10%<br>
fetal bovine serum. One (1) ml of cell-free culture<br>
supernatant was dispensed into a 1.5 ml plastic tube and<br>
the sample was stored for about two months at -80°C. The<br>
frozen sample containing the pseudotyped virus particles<br>
was placed into a standard SpeedVac connected to a vacuum<br>
pump. The sample was dried in the SpeedVac for one hour<br>
under a vacuum. The lyophilized sample was assayed for<br>
infectivity as described above. Substantial virus<br>
infectivity was retained in the lyophilized sample.<br>
This data indicates that the pseudotyped virus<br>
particles are exceptionally stable as compared to native<br>
retrovirus particles. Further, typical retrovirus<br>
particles do not retain substantial infectivity after<br>
sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. That the<br>
pseudotyped virus particles survive both<br>
ultracentrifugation and lyophilization is unexpected and<br>
indicates that the HIVpol-/VSV-G is a superior vaccine<br>
product.<br>
The described replication-defective HIV-1 vector<br>
can establish only a single cycle of viral replication.<br>
Viral antigens were expressed in transduced cells and<br>
functioned as target cells for cytotoxic T lymphocytes from<br>
HIV infected individuals. Furthermore, an antibody<br>
response to HIV-1 has been demonstrated in mice immunized<br>
with the described replication-defective HIV.<br>
The replication-defective HIV-1 described herein<br>
provides a safe vaccine. The replication defective virus<br>
presented herein encodes all HIV-1 proteins and a truncated<br>
pol gene. Because the important protease and reverse<br>
transcriptase activities are nonfunctional in the described<br>
construct, provirus cannot initiate a second round of<br>
replication. The VSV-G pseudotyped virus expands cell<br>
tropism to all primate species as well as expanding the<br>
types of cells which may be infected in a single animal or<br>
individual. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of the same<br>
vaccine preparations can be evaluated in monkeys,<br>
chimpanzees and humans. A recent report indicates that<br>
VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 not only can expand cell tropism<br>
but also can enhance infectivity by using a different<br>
receptor pathway (Aiken, C, Journal of Virology 71 (1997):<br>
5871-5877). A unique feature of the replication-defective<br>
retroviral vector described herein is the absence of co-<br>
expression of foreign protein derived from the vector<br>
systems (e.g., adenovirus, poliovirus and vaccinia virus<br>
vectors) during the single round of replication.<br>
Therefore, an advantage over the attenuated retroviral and<br>
pox vaccines is that it is feasible to repeatedly immunize<br>
a subject in order to boost the immune response.<br>
It is believed that cell-mediated immunity plays<br>
a very important role in protective immunity of viral<br>
infection and is associated with long-term survival of HIV-<br>
1 infected patients (Miller, M.D. et al., Journal of<br>
Immunology 144 (1989): 122-128; Kent, S.J. et al., Journal<br>
of Virology 70 (1996): 4941-4947). The class-I restricted<br>
antigen presenting pathway is responsible for cell-mediated<br>
immunity (Salk, Jonas et al., Science 260 (1993): 1270-<br>
1272). It has been demonstrated that the live attenuated<br>
vaccines provided the best protective immunity against SIV<br>
infection in vaccinated animals. In that system, the<br>
protective immunity could be elicited due to cell-mediated<br>
immune response as the result of endogenously expressed<br>
viral antigens (Johnson, R.P. et al., Journal of Virology<br>
71 (1997): 7711-7718). The replication-defective HIV-1<br>
vector described herein provides a safe vaccine candidate<br>
to express viral antigens endogenously. Despite the low MOI<br>
(0.1) of defective HIV that was used in the cytotoxic T<br>
lymphocyte assay, strong (30%) specific lysis was observed<br>
in the chromium release assay. These data suggest either<br>
high level of viral protein expression or high efficiency<br>
of transduction in primary B lymphocytes. Furthermore, the<br>
efficacy of protective immunity can be further tested in<br>
the rhesus monkeys and in other nonhuman primates.<br>
It is not clear which viral antigen elicits the<br>
protective immunity in attenuated viruses vaccinated<br>
animals. Using replication-defective HIV-1 vectors with<br>
different deletions (e.g., gag, gag-pol, env), the viral<br>
factors contributing to the protective immunity (cellular<br>
or humoral immune responses) can be assessed in this<br>
system. Because viral antigens (about 200 ng/ml p24) are<br>
present in the viral supernatants used for the<br>
immunization, it is not absolutely certain whether the<br>
antibody response elicited in mice is due to soluble viral<br>
antigens or endogenously expressed viral proteins. Due to<br>
the fact that no adjuvant was used for immunization and<br>
little (total of 100 ng p24 per mouse) viral supernatant<br>
(antigens) was inoculated into the mice, the antibody<br>
responses were likely elicited by the transduced cells.<br>
It is intriguing and unexpected that defective<br>
HIV particles cannot establish productive infection in MAGI<br>
cells when the VSV-G protein is omitted from the viral<br>
particles. Since all the viral structure proteins are<br>
present in the co-transfected cells, this phenomenon<br>
suggests that VSV-G protein is much more efficient than<br>
envelope protein for viral infectivity in this assay<br>
system.<br>
The above invention has been described with<br>
reference to the preferred embodiment. Obvious<br>
modifications and alterations will occur to others upon<br>
reading and understanding the preceding detailed<br>
description. It is intended that the invention be<br>
construed as including all such modifications and<br>
alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims or the equivalents thereof.<br>

particles.<br>
11. A replication-defective retrovirus particle,<br>
comprising:<br>
a. a retroviral genome in which a portion of the pol<br>
gene including the protease and reverse<br>
transcriptase activity coding regions is modified<br>
to the extent that the remaining pol gene cannot<br>
produce a protease and reverse transcriptase<br>
capable of functioning in replication of the<br>
genome; and<br>
b. a pseudotyping protein.<br>
12. The replication-defective retrovirus particle as<br>
claimed in claim 11, wherein the retroviral genome is<br>
an HIV genome.<br>
13. The replication-defective retrovirus particle as<br>
claimed in claim 11, wherein the retroviral genome is<br>
an HIV-1 genome.<br>
14. The replication-defective retrovirus particle as<br>
claimed in claim 10, wherein the pol gene is modified<br>
by deletion of nucleotide sequences thereof.<br>
15. The replication-defective retrovirus particle as<br>
claimed in claim 11, wherein the retroviral genome is<br>
a pol- construct derived from plasmid pHXB2 with<br>
nucleotides 2621-4552 thereof deleted.<br>
16. The replication-defective retrovirus particle as<br>
claimed in claim 13, wherein the pseudotyping protein<br>
is vesicular stomatitis virus G protein.<br>
17. The replication-defective retrovirus particle as<br>
claimed in claim 11, wherein the particle includes a<br>
retroviral protein which is an immunological variant<br>
of a wild-type retroviral protein.<br>
18. A vaccine comprising a virus particle as claimed in<br>
claim 9 in combination with a pharmaceutically and/or<br>
veterinarilly suitable excipient.<br>
19. The vaccine as claimed in claim 18, wherein the<br>
excipient is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
buffer system, a mono-, di-, oligo- or polysaccharide,<br>
a viscosity enhancing or tackifying agent, a polymer,<br>
a copolymer, a block polymer and a cross-linked<br>
polymer.<br>
20. The vaccine as claimed in claim 18, wherein the<br>
vaccine is lyophilized.<br>
21. The vaccine as claimed in claim 18, wherein the<br>
vaccine is prepared in a form selected from the group<br>
consisting of an oral liquid, an oral capsule, a<br>
liquid for parenteral injection, a transdermal or<br>
transmucosal device and a suppository, and the<br>
excipient is a suitable excipient for preparation of<br>
the selected form.<br>
22. The vaccine as claimed in claim 18, wherein the<br>
retroviral genome is an HIV-1 genome and the<br>
pseudotyping protein is VSV-G.<br>
23. A vaccine as claimed in claim 18, further comprising<br>
a second replication-defective pol- virus particle<br>
representing an immunological variant of the virus<br>
particle.<br><br>
A replication-defective HIV particle pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G). The pol gene of the HIV genome in the particle is modified to inactivate the pol reverse transcriptase and protease activity. This pseudotyped HIV particle can infect many cell types, including human and simian cells, and only undergoes one round of replication. Furthermore, a virus-specific immune response can be detected in mice immunized with the VSV-G pseudotyped replication-defective HIV.</td>
