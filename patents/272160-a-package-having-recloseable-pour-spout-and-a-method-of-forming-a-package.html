IMPROVED PACKAGE HAVING RECLOSEABLE POUR SPOUT<br>
Technical Field [0001]    The present Invention relates genersilly to recloseable packages, and more particularly to a package having a recloseable pour spout, which can be configured to Include side gussets, and which is particularly suited for use for packaging dry, pourable contents.<br>
Background Of The Invention [0002]      Recloseable packages have come into Increasingly widespread use In view of the convenience they provide to consumers and other users to permit a portion of a package's contents to be used, and the package effectively raclosed. To this end, packages have been provided with recloseable elements Including profile fastener strips, cooperating adhesive strips, hook-and-loop fastener elements, and the like, to permit a package to be conveniently reclosed after its Initial opening. U.S. Patents No. 5,782,733, No. 4,655,862, No. 4,644,769, and No. 4,909,017, alt hereby incorporated by reference, disclose various recloseable package constructions, and methods for effecting their formation.<br>
[0003]      Packages formed In accordance with the above-referenced patents typically Include a package portion which Is removable for Initial opening of the package, and for providing access to a profile fastener strip or other type of recloseable element. In typical constructions known heretofore, the recJoseable element of the package extends substantially completely across one dimension of the package, i.e., completely across the width of the package. Access to the package contents Is thus facilitated. [0004]     For some applications, however, It can be desirable to maintain the sealed Integrity of a portion of the package, while an associated portion of the package is configured for recloseable opening, Such an arrangement permits a  package to be formed to Include a pour spout, thus facilitating convenient pouring of the packages contents, such as dog food, fertillier, dry cereal, or other dry, pourable materials. The present invention is directed to a package including a recloseable pour spout, which package can desirably be configured to Include side guseets, thus desirably increasing the Internal capacity of the package with efficient use of packaging materials.<br>
Summary Of The Invention [0006]      The present invention is directed to a package Including a pour spout that can be conveniently rectosed after the package Is Initially opened. Notably, the present package can be configured to Include side gussets, providing the package with a configuration which provides the package with desired Internal volume, and efficient use of packaging materials.<br><br>
The present package can Include a longitudinal seal joining front and rear package panels to each other, adjacent to the pour spout, which desirably acts to close off the interior of the package after the pour spout has been Initially opened. Additionally, when provided with a pair of side gussets, the present package can Include an arrangement of corner seals (sometimes referred to as quad seals) which desirably aot to rigidlly and stabilize the package and its contents In a free-standing orientation. In particular, corner seals provided at the one of the Side gussets at which the pour spout is formed preferably do not extend the full length of the package. A method of making the package is also disclosed, the disclosed method facilitating use of the package with high-speed form, fill, and seal (FFS) . packaging machinery, for efficient and eoonomloal use.<br>
[00061      In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the present package Includes a front package panel and a rear paokage panel, with the illustrated embodiment further including a pair of side gussets joining respective opposite edges of the front panel and the rear panel to each other. While the present package is Illustrated as Including side gussets, It will be understood that the present package may be configured without such side gussets, in a so-called "pillow pack" configuration.<br>
[0007]     The package of the present invention further includes a recloseable fastener strip extending from confronting Inside surfaces of the front and rear package panels, thai Is, from a portion of an inside surface of the front panel to a portion of an inside surface of the rear panel, If the package is configured to include side gussets, the listener strip extends along an inside surface of one of the gussets. The fastener strip may be provided In the form of a profile fastener strip, an adhesive fastener strip, or a hook-end-loop fastener strip, such that the fastener strip Is configured for detachable connection to iteelf. [0008]      The front and rear panels, and the side gussets, if provided, are sealed to each other at an upper edge of the package to form a sealed header, a portion of which Is removable to form a pour spout of the package. The removable portion of the header is positioned above and adjacent to the fastener strip of the package, with the fastener strip thus being positioned for reclosing the pour spout after initial package opening. This is easily effected by folding the fastener strip and connecting It to itself, thereby closing the pour spout of the package. While a portion of the sealed header of the package is removable, the remainder of the sealed header remains intact, thus maintaining the integrity of the package-<br>
[0009]      To facilitate opening of the removable portion of the sealed header, the package preferably includes at least one weakened region, such as provided in the form of scoring, perforations, or the like. If the package la provided with side gussets. the weakened region<br><br>
preferably extends through that one of the side gussets provided  at that portion of the package providing the pour spout<br>
[0010J     Efficient formation of the present package Is achieved by providing a web of material having a longitudinal axis, and applying a plurality of fastener ©trips to the web of material at intervals corresponding to a length of each of the packages being formed. Each fastener $trlp extends transversely of the longitudinal axis of the web of material As will be appreciated, a web of materia) having fasteners pro-applied thereto can be rolled and stored, and thereafter used in conjunction with a form, fill, and seal machine for completing package formation attendant to product filling. Alternatively, the present packages can be formed in a so-called "in-line" process, wherein the fastener strips are applied to th© web of materia! as the material and strips are fed into a form, fill, and seal machine,, and other packaging systems, Including pouch-making equipment<br>
[0011]      Package formation Is effected by folding the web of material, and sealing the material to Itself to form a tube. The tube is transversely sealed to form a aeries of packages In end-to-end relationship, with each package Including a front package panel and a rear package panel A respective one of the fastener strips extends from a portion of the front panel to a portion of the rear panel of the rsspective package, thereby forming the desired recloseable pour spout, A pair of Inwardly extending side gussets can be formed in the tube prior to the transversely sealing step, with each fastener strip extending from the front panel to the rear panel of the respective package along an Inside surface of a respective on© of the side gussets,<br>
[0012]     The present package can be formed In alternative ways, depending upon the specific application. In one form, the web of materia! is sealed to itself generally along the rear panel of each package. Formation )n this fashion includes application of a plurality of fastener strips to the web of material offset from the longitudinal axis thereof, whereby the desired pour spout is provided at an upper corner of each package being formed. Alternatively, the web of material can be sealed to itself generally along an edge of the front pane! or rear panel of each package, such as at one of the side gussets, which can be desirable for providing an unseamed rear panel having suitable graphics or the like thereon. Formation in ttiis manner can be effected by application of a plurality of fastening strips to the web of material In alignment with the longitudinal axis thereof, that is. with each of the fastener strips Intersecting the longitudinal axis Formation in this fashion can be desirable If packages are to be formed by pre-application of the fastener strips to the web of material, followed by forming a roll of the material for subsequent unrolling and use with a form, fill and seal machine. The manner in which each fastener strip is positioned In alignment with<br><br>
  r<br>
function of the fastener strip. In a further embodiment, a pair of auxiliary corner seals can be formed respective|y joining the one of the gussets to the front and rear package panels above the fastener strip, with the auxiliary corner seals preferably provided in the sealed header of the package to facilitate removal thereof. Thus, as will be appreciated, the corner seals formed along the gusset of the package at which the pour spout is formed can be discontinuous, i,e., each extend above and below the fastener strip, but not across the fastener strip.<br>
[0016] other features and advantages of the present Invention will beoome readily apparent from the following detailed desoription, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.<br><br>

Detailed Description [0027]      While the present Invention is susceptible of embodiment In various forms, there is shown in the drawings, and will hereinafter be described, a presently preferred embodiments of the invention, with the understanding that the present disclosure Is to be considered as an exemplification of the invention, and is not Intended to limit the Invention to the specific embodiment illustrated,<br>
[0028]      The present Invention discloses a package, which can be configured to Include side gussets, wherein an upper corner of the package can be opened to form a pour spout. As will be further described, the package Includes a fastener strip on the inside of the package which facilitates convenient recloslng of the pour spout after initial opening, A fastener strip is employed which Is sufficiently flexible as to permit the package to assume a<br><br>
normal configuration before opening, with the fastener strip having a generally W-shape if the paclcage Includes side gusseta. After initial package opening, a generally U-shaped pour spout is formed, with the now-exposed fastener strip on the Inside of the package permitting the pour spout to be conveniently reclosed for subsequent pouring of the package contents. The present package Is particularly suited for use for dry, pourable contents, such as dog food, dry cereal, fertilizer, and the like.<br>
[0029]      With particular reference to FIGURE 1, the present package 10 can be suitably formed from a wide variety of materials, Including plastic film, paper, laminate composites, and the like, as la well-known in the art. The package 10 includes a generally rectangular front package panel 12 and a generally redangular rear package pane) 14, which in the illustrated embodiment are joined to each other at respective opposite edges by a pair of Inwardly extending side gussets 16 and 18. As will be appreciated, the package embodying the principles of the present invention can be provided without side gussets, with the respective edge portions of front panel 12 and rear panel 14 connected directly to each other. In the form of a so-calied "plllow pack".<br>
[00301      As will be further described, package 10 Is formed from a web of material which is shaped into a tube, with the material joined to itself along a seam whloh extends along the length of the web of material. Package 10 thus includes a back seam 20, but it is within the purview of the present invention that the seam at whloh the web of material is joined to Itself can be provided generally at the edge of one of the front or rear panels, with the seam thus being positioned generally within one of the side gussets 16,18, 100311      Package 10 is closed and sealed et upper and lower portions thereof by transverse seals. Bottom seal 22 joins front and rear panels 12 and 14 to each other, and to side gusset© 16,18. Depending upon the specific configuration which Is desired, the side . gussets can be sealed "closed" at the top and bottom seals, or can be left "open", as illustrated, that is, each of the side gussets forms a generally V-shape at the top and bottom of the package.<br>
|;0032] An upper transverse seal of the package 10 joins front panel 12 and rear panel 14 to each other, and to side gussets 16 and 18, and thus fonrts a sealed header 24 of the package 10.<br>
[0033]      In accordance with the present Invention, an upper marginal corner portion 25 of package 10, including a portion of seated header 24. is removable for forming a pour spout for the package 10. To this end, the package 10 Is optionally provided with a weakened region 26 at an upper corner of the package which facilitates removal of the portion 25 generally within the weakened region 26, Weakened region 26 may comprise suitable<br><br>
perforations, scoring eucli a© by knife or laser, or other weakening of the region to facilitate convenient removal of the upper corner portlpn,25, of ..the package by a consumer in the Illustrated embodiment, weakened region 26 Is shown as a series of perforations, with the weakened region extending Into and through side gusset 16 which Is disposed at that side of the package 10 at which the pour spout Is pprovded. A weakened region 26 is not necessary for practice of the present invention, since a portion of the package header 24 can alternatively be removed by a user by use of a suitable knife, scissers, or the like. [00341      FIGURE 2 illustrates the present package 10 after fracture of weakened region 28, and removal of portion 25 of the package, including a portion of sealed header 24, to form a pour spout, generally designated 28, AS will be observed, side gusset 16 is generally inverted or outwardly turned for formation of the pour spout 28, thus faollltatlng convenient dispensing of the contents of the package 10, As shown, the remaining portion of sealed header 14 remains intact, thus providing desired Integrity for the package as It is manipulated to pour contents therefrom,<br>
[0035]      In accordance with the present invention, convenient reolosjng of pour spout 26 is effected by the provision of fastener strip 30 which is secured to the Inside surface of the package 10. As illustrated, fastener strip 30 extends between confronting surfaces of front panel 12 and rear panel 14, that Is, extends along a portion of the front panel and a portion of the back panel, generally beneath the pour spout 28 defined by weakened region 26 of the package, preferably generally along one side of the longitudinal centerline of the package. If the package 10 Includes side gussets as illustrated, the fastener strip 30 extends along the inside surface of side gussets 16. By this arrangement, the fastener strip 30, which Is selected to exhibit the necessary flexibility, has a generally W-shape prior to opening of the package (see FIGURE 4), and assumes a generally loop-shape or U-shape after the pour spout has been opened (FIGURE 5),<br>
[0036]      Fastener strip 30 Is configured for detachable connection to itself, and in this way facilitates convenient closing of the pour spout after the desired quantity of the contents of package 10 have been dispensed. The fastener strip Is simply folded and pressed against itself, as illustrated in FIGURES 3 and 4, thus closing the pour spout 28. As will be observed, side gusset 13 Is maintained In its outwardly extending disposition, thus facilitating detachable securement of the fastener strip 30 to itself substantially along its entire folded length. The package 10 is now-effectively closed for subsequent reuse. [0037]      The specific configuration of fastener 30 can be varied while keeping with the principles disclosed therein. In one presently contemplated embodiment, the fastener strip 30 is provided in the form of a so-called profile fastener strip, which typically includes at<br><br><br><br>
[00423     As will be appreciated, profile elements 32 provide the attachment elements for detachable connection of the fastener strip 30 to itself while upper and lower flange portions 34, 36 facilitate handling of each fastener strip, and seourement to the associated web of material from which the package 10 is formed. In this regard, it is preferred that the profile elements 32, or the one or more attachment elements of a fastener strip 30 provided in another form, be positioned as closely as practicable to the sealed header 24 of the package, thus minimizing the unsealed region which exits between the header and the attachment element of the fastener strip. This spacing. designated S In FIGURE 3, is preferably about 0.1876 Inches to about 0 .75 inches, thus providing sufficient space for forming equipment to form the necessary seal between upper flange portion 34 and ths associated film material during package formation. To achieve this preferred spacing, the lower flange portion 36 may have a larger dimension than upper flange portion 34.<br>
[0043]     In accordance with the present Invention, the present recloseable package can be provided with a longitudinal seal 40 which Is provided adjacent to pour spout 28 and joins front panel portion 12 and rear panel portion 14 to each other. Longitudinal seal 40 -desirably acts to dose the Interior of the package after removal of corner portion 25 of sealed header 24, thus desirably maintaining the Integrity of the package's contents, In the embodiment illustrated in FIGURES 1-3, longitudinal seal 40 extends from adjacent the pour spout 28 Inwardly of the recloseable fastener strip 30, and preferably overlaps the fastener strip to seal the ends of the strip together. Fastener strip 30 can preferably be provided with a length that is greater than the periphery of the open pour spout 28, thus desirably avoiding the need for excessive precision In positioning of the fastener strip. [0044]      In an alternative embodiment illustrated In FIGURE 11, a longitudinal seal 40* Is provided, wherein the longitudinal seal extends from adjacent the pour spout of the package to overlap the fastener strip 30 above the fastener element thereof [0045]      As will be appreciated, the longitudinal seal, 40,40, desirably closes off the opening that is formed In the package once the removable header portion of the package Is removed to form the package pour spout Formation of the longitudinal seal 40,40' is effected after the material from which the package Is fomned is shaped into a tube, as further described hereinafter.<br>
[0046]     With further reference to FIGURE 11, when the present package Is provided with side gussets, the package may be provided with an arrangement of corner seals, sometimes referred to as quad seals, which desirably act to rigidify and stabilize the package and Its contents in a free-standing orientation. Corner seals of this nature can be<br><br>
provided generally In accordance with the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 5,862,652. hereby incorporated by reference, with the exception that the corner seale formed on the side of the package at which the pour spout is formed do not extend the full length of the package. [0047]      In particular, FIGURE 11 illustrates a pair of comer seals 42 at side gusset 18, and another pair of corner seals 44 at side gusset 16, at which the pour spout is formed. ,The pair of corner seals at each of the gussets respectively join eac of the gussets to the front and rear package panels 12 and 14. As will be noted, corner seals 44 at side gusset 18 preferably extend substantially the full length of the package 10. [0048]      In contrast, corner seals 44 at side gusset 16, the one of the gussets at which the pour spout is formed, do not extend the full length of package 10. Rather, corner seals 44 each extend downwardly from a point below the fastener element (e,g., profile element) of the fastener strip 30, with this point prefenabiy being spaced below the fastener element. This spacing Is preferably selected so that the corner seals do not significantly inhibit shaping of the side gusset 16 and the front and rear package panels to the desired generally U-shaped configuration of the pour spout 28 during use. If the comer seals 44 extend too closely to the fastener element of the fastener strip 30, they can undesirably inhibit the package assuming the desired U-shaped configuration In the region of the pour spout As will be appreciated, it is particularly preferred that the corner seals 44 do not extend over or intersect the fastener element of the fastener strip 30, which could otherwise undesirably inhibit the desired self-sealing nature of the fastener strip 30. I0049J      FIGURE 11 illustrates a further optional fsaturs of the present Invention, wherein auxiliary corner seals 46 are provided which respectively join side gussets 18 to the front and rear package panels above the fastener strip 30. The auxiliary corner seals 46 are preferably provided In the sealed header 24 of the package, preferably above any weakened region 28.. This arrangement facilitates manual removal of upper corner portion 26 since each auxiliary corner seal 46 is somewhat rigid, by virtue of its sealed nature, thus facilitating manipulation of the corner portion 25 at weakened portion 26, which can extend beneath each of the auxiliary corner seals 46.<br>
[0050]     Thus, the preferred arrangement of comer seals 42,44 desirably prevents the comer seals from limiting the size of the pour spout, which could otherwise be the case if the corner seals 44 are provided too close to the fastener elements of the fastener strip 3D to prevent the pour spout from opening fully. In the prefen-ed form, each corner seam 44 Is spaced below the fastener elements 32 of the fastener strip by a distance which generally corresponds to the distance between each corner seal 44 and the fold of the respective gusset 16, l,e., the folded width of the gusset This facilitates the pour spout fully opening.<br><br>
[0061]     FIGURES 9 and 10 dlagrammtially illustrate formation of the present package, which as noted above, oan be effected by pre-application of fastener strips 30 to a web of material from which the package is formed, for subsequent us© with a form, fill, and seal machine, or performed In-line with a form, fill, and seel machine, [0052]     A web of material W from which package 10 Is formed, can be provided In roll form,and unwound so that the web of material defines a longitudinal axis. A plurality of the fastener strips 30 are provided, and are applied to the web of material W at Intervals I which correspond to the length of each package being formed. As noted, each fastener strip 30 preferably fe applied as a single piece of material during formation in this manner, even if each fastener strip Itself comprises discrete portions, such as profile elements and associated flange portions.<br>
[0053]      After each fastener strip 30 is applied to the web of material so that it extends transversely of the longitudinal axis thereof, the web of material Is folded, and sealed to Itself to form a tube. In this fashion, back seam 20 is fonned. The tube of material Is transversely sealed to form a series of packages in end-to-end relationship, with each package including front and rear panels, as described above. As illustrated, a respective one of the fastener strips 30 extends from a portion of the front panel to 9 portion of the rear panel of the respective package, to thereby form the recioseable pour spout of the package. If the package is to be provided with side gussets, as illustrated, the web of material is guided with respect to suitable plows which form the side gussets prior to transverse sealing of the tube.<br>
[00S4]      As Illustrated in FIGURE 9, the web of material W is sealed to itself generally along the rear panel 14 of each package being formed, with a plurality of fastener strips 30 applied to the web of material in offset relationship form the longitudinal axis thereof. In contrast, FIGURE 10 Illustrates formation of the package seam generally at one of the Junction lines between the front and rear panels and the side gussets, that Is, generally at one of the edges of the front and rear panels within the associated side gusset.
