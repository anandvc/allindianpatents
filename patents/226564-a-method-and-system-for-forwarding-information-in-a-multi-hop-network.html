TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to communication networks, and more<br>
particularly to multi-hop networks and a routing mechanism for such networks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Protocols for sharing a wireless medium effectively among multiple users are<br>
generally denoted multiple access protocols, channel access schemes or medium<br>
access schemes. Multiple access protocols may as described in [1] be divided in two<br>
main categories: conflict-free protocols and contention-based protocols.<br>
Conflict-free protocols are protocols ensuring that a transmission, whenever made, is<br>
successful, i.e. not interfered by other transmissions. Conflict-free transmission can be<br>
achieved by allocating the channel to the users either statically or dynamically. This is<br>
often denoted fixed and dynamic scheduling respectively. The benefit of precise<br>
coordination among stations is that it is believed to provide high efficiency, but comes<br>
at the expense of complexity and exchange of sometime large quantities of control<br>
traffic.<br>
Contention-based protocols differ in principle from conflict-free protocols in that<br>
transmissions are not guaranteed to be successful. The protocol should therefore<br>
prescribe a procedure to resolve conflicts once they occur so that all message are<br>
eventually transmitted successfully.<br>
Multiple access protocols can also be divided based on the scenario or application for<br>
which they have been designed. Some protocols are suitable for access towards/from a<br>
single station, e.g. a base station in a cellular system, whereas other protocols are<br>
designed to operate in a distributed environment. An important distinction for the<br>
distributed case is whether the protocol is designed primarily for a single hop case, i.e.<br>
communication only with a designated neighbor within reach, or if it is particularly<br>
designed for a multi-hop scenario.<br>
In a multi-hop scenario, information may be transmitted over multiple hops between<br>
source and destination instead of directly in a single hop. In general, the multi-hop<br>
approach offers several advantages such as lower power consumption and higher<br>
information throughput compared to a direct one-hop approach. In a multi-hop network,<br>
nodes out of reach from each other can benefit from intermediately located nodes that<br>
can forward their messages from the source towards the destination. Multi-hop<br>
networks can be so-called ad hoc networks where nodes are mostly mobile and no<br>
central coordinating infrastructure exists, but the idea of multi-hop networking can<br>
also be applied when nodes are fixed.<br>
In prior art routing techniques based on an underlying shortest-path routing protocol<br>
(such as Bellman-Ford based routing), a well-defined multi-hop route from source to<br>
destination is determined based on routing cost information passed through the system.<br>
Simplified, each node or station knows the costs of its outgoing links, and broadcasts<br>
this information to each of the neighboring nodes. Such link-cost information is<br>
typically maintained in a local database in each node and based on the information in<br>
the database, a routing table is calculated using a suitable routing algorithm. In<br>
general, shortest path and similar routing techniques lead to the existence of a single<br>
route for each source-destination pan*. A very simple shortest-path based routing<br>
scheme, though not the most efficient, may for example use the well known ALOHA<br>
contention-based multiple access protocol.<br>
There are existing protocols (which may use an underlying shortest-path protocol)<br>
based on the concept of exploiting multiple nodes in the forwarding process with a<br>
more or less active routing choice. For example, the protocol called EIGRP (Enhanced<br>
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) [2] is a routing protocol, used mainly in a fixed<br>
network that allows random-based forwarding to one out of several routers. Randombut-<br>
forward routing [3] by Sylvester and Kleinrock is similar to EIGRP, i.e. randombased<br>
forwarding of packets to one out of several packet radio network routers, but it<br>
also includes an important amendment; it is ensured that a packet is always heading in<br>
the general correct direction. Alternate path routing [4] by DARPA (Defense Advance<br>
Research Project Agency) allows a packet that is retransmitted over a link to be<br>
duplicated while multicasted to several nodes from which the packet again follows a<br>
shortest path routing approach. Primary N/M-forwarding [5] is based on the idea that a<br>
node tries to send a packet at most N times to a node and then, if failing, it tries the<br>
next node up to N times. This procedure is repeated for at most M nodes prior to<br>
dropping the packet. The advantage of alternate path routing and primary~M/Mforwarding<br>
is that they can adapt to the local communication situation, including<br>
congestion and temporarily poor communication due to e.g. fading or interference<br>
fluctuations.<br>
Changes or fluctuations within the system over time can create windows or peaks of<br>
opportunity that enable signal transmissions to be more successful than at other times'and<br>
conditions. Plain shortest-path techniques and associated prior art routing techniques do<br>
not have the ability to recognize these windows of opportunity, since there is no relative<br>
information stored by each node or station. In contrast, opportune routing [6,7] exploit to<br>
some extent the opportunities that system changes and fluctuations provide. In the<br>
context of wireless routing in particular, overall system performance is degraded when<br>
link quality varies rapidly over time (e.g. due to Rayleigh fading). However, opportune<br>
routing partly mitigates this performance degradation by making use of the windows of<br>
opportunity that these fluctuations provide. With opportune routing, there is not a single<br>
route for each source-destination pair, i.e. similar to EIGRP, random-but-forward and to<br>
some extent also alternate path routing and primary N/M-forwarding. Instead, data<br>
packets follow a route that is somewhat random, while still leading from source to<br>
destination. Consequently, when a shortest-path procedure is used, consecutive packets<br>
will generally be sent over the same route, whereas when opportune routing is used,<br>
consecutive packets may be routed over different paths but in the same direction.<br>
However, the general monitoring in [6, 7] is a slow process. Monitoring is either handled<br>
by listening on bypassing messages or by occasionally sending out so-called probes.<br>
"When a probe is sent out, a response that includes information on for example path loss is<br>
expected back. When there is a delay between the probe and data transmission, then the<br>
returned input information for the forwarding algorithm may become obsolete by the<br>
time the data is transmitted. A particularly undesirable consequence is that existing<br>
opportune routing, and also plain shortest-path based routing techniques, do not handle<br>
possible diversity effects efficiently.<br>
Selection diversity forwarding (SDF) [8] is a technique for efficiently handling diversity<br>
effects in a near optimal manner. This novel approach is based on directing transmission<br>
from an originating station to a group of receivers or relay nodes nearby. When one or<br>
more of the receiving nodes have replied, one of the replying nodes is selected and a<br>
command message is transmitted to the selected relay node instructing it to assume<br>
responsibility for forwarding the data message. The process is repeated for all subsequent<br>
responsible nodes until the information reaches the destination. By following this<br>
approach, both branch diversity and capture effects can be exploited in the data<br>
forwarding process. In particular, branch diversity reduces the need to use interleaved<br>
data together with coding to combat fading channels, which in turn means smaller delay<br>
and consequently higher throughput. The capture effect refers to a phenomenon in which<br>
only the stronger of two signals that are at or near the same frequency is demodulated,<br>
while the weaker signal is suppressed and rejected as noise. In conjunction with multiple<br>
receiving stations, the capture effect provides a high degree of robustness when data<br>
transmissions collide. SDF utilizes a slow underlying cost protocol, but allows<br>
instantaneous adaptation to fast channel fluctuations per se.<br>
Similar ideas for exploiting fluctuations, but for normal cellular networks with single<br>
hops, can be found in [9, 10 and 11], which refer to High Speed Downlink Packet<br>
Access (HSDPA), High Data Rate (HDR) and Opportunistic Beamforming (OB),<br>
respectively. HSDPA and HDR are very similar to each other. Opportunistic<br>
Beamforming however is different from a functional point of view in that OB<br>
randomly points, or continuously sweeps an antenna beam, in different directions,<br>
whereas HSDPA and HDR has no notion of beamforming. In particular, Opportunistic<br>
Beamforming [11] exploits the opportunistic idea and then utilizes the opportunistic<br>
approach with respect to beamforming to enhance system capacity in a cellular system<br>
or at a base station. However, the concept of HSDPA, HDR and OB as such does not<br>
relate to multi-hopping. OB is essentially an extension of fast scheduling at the base<br>
station taking fast channel fluctuations into account, which has been suggested both<br>
for CDMA 2000 HDR and WCDMA HSDPA.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes these and other drawbacks of the prior art<br>
arrangements.<br>
It is a general object of the present invention to provide an efficient mechanism for<br>
forwarding information hi a multi-hop network.<br>
It is an object of the invention to improve the performance of a multi-hop network with<br>
regard to throughput, delay characteristics and/or power consumption.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to improve Quality of Service (QoS) support in the<br>
network.<br>
Another object of the invention concerns improvements with regard to load distribution.<br>
It is a particular object of the invention to provide a method and system for efficient<br>
forwarding of information in a multi-hop network.<br>
It is also an object to provide a communication node supporting efficient forwarding of<br>
information in a packet radio multi-hop network.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a control node supporting efficient<br>
forwarding of information in a packet radio multi-hop network.<br>
These and other objects are met by the invention as defined by the accompanying patent<br>
claims.<br>
A main aspect of the invention is based on the idea that a higher degree of freedom in<br>
the forwarding process can be obtained by investigating which destinations and/or<br>
flows that are represented in a transmitting node and selecting relay direction through<br>
a wise choice of destination and/or flow. In effect, the forwarding algorithm proposed<br>
by the invention jointly selects i) relay node among multiple relay candidate nodes and<br>
ii) at least one of a) flow among multiple flows and b) destination among multiple<br>
destinations. The transmitting node then selects a set of information heading for a<br>
selected destination and/or belonging to a selected flow from the transmit queue, and<br>
finally transmits the selected information to the selected relay node.<br>
In this way, the invention effectively enables selection among more relay nodes<br>
compared to the situation of simply selecting a suitable relay node for the first packet<br>
at the head of the transmit queue. The main reason for this added degree of freedom<br>
lies in the fact that different packets, or more generally different sets of data, may be<br>
heading in various directions from the transmitting node, thus enabling selection of<br>
relay node in several general forwarding directions. The selection is often based on<br>
cost progress, and maybe even forward progress in geographic distance. It is also<br>
possible to consider QoS (Quality of Service) aspects in the selection process, since for<br>
example different flows may have different QoS requirements. By way of example, a<br>
flow with strict delay requirements may then be prioritized higher than a flow with<br>
more relaxed delay requirements. Fairness between destinations and/or flows is<br>
another aspect that may be considered in the selection process. Anyway, the selection<br>
of destination/flow ultimately translates into a selection of information to be<br>
transmitted from the transmit queue.<br>
For further improvement, it is proposed to jointly select a combination of<br>
destination/flow, relay node as well as one or more link parameters for<br>
transmission/reception of data. This means that the invention allows for selection<br>
among relays for multiple packets, while simultaneously adapting link parameters,<br>
such as link mode, frequency channels or sub-carriers, transmit power and/or antenna<br>
weights, for optimal communication. The link parameters may generally be selected<br>
from DLC (Data Link Control) parameters on the data link layer as well as underlying<br>
physical PHY layer parameters.<br>
The selection process in which different destinations/flows, relay nodes and optionally<br>
also link parameters are jointly considered, is normally based on information<br>
representing link performance between the transmitting node under consideration and<br>
each one of the relay candidate nodes. For this reason, communication is preferably<br>
divided into three or four phases, an interrogation phase, a response phase, a data<br>
phase and an optional acknowledgement phase. The two initial phases are typically<br>
designed to inquire and retrieve link performance information such as channel and<br>
transmission information in relation to each one of the relay candidate nodes, e.g.<br>
through the report of expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or signal-tonoise+<br>
interference ratio (SINR), or alternatively by indicating a supported<br>
transmission rate. The SINR includes both interference and noise, and is therefore<br>
often preferred. Once a selection of destination/flow, relay node and a suitable set of<br>
data from the transmit queue is completed with or without integrated link adaptation,<br>
the data is transmitted to the relay node in the data phase. If desired, the selected relay<br>
node may acknowledge reception of data in the acknowledgement phase. Preferably,<br>
the above three or four phases are performed within a period of time that has a shorter<br>
duration than the channel coherence time to allow for fast adaptation. Other<br>
acknowledgement schemes may also be used. For example, acknowledgements may<br>
deliberately be delayed and collected in an aggregate acknowledgement message that<br>
is sent less frequently (an acknowledgement does not necessarily have to be within the<br>
coherence time).<br>
It is desirable to jointly select destination/flow, relay node and optional link parameters<br>
that are optimal in some sense. In order to be able to speak about optimality in a welldefined<br>
manner, an objective function based on quality cost progress or information cost<br>
progress is preferably introduced and optimized with respect to destination/flow, relay<br>
node and optional link parameters. For example, the above scheme allows an objective<br>
function to be defined and optimized for instantaneous SNR/SINR situations, e.g. to<br>
provide maximization of throughput and rninimization of delay.<br>
If multiple flows are supported for some destination(s), the selection may then be a<br>
combination of flow and destination. If destination is used as optimization variable<br>
instead of flow, the selection result will include a selected relay node and destination.<br>
However, there may be several flows to the selected destination and it is thus still an<br>
open question as to which flow to select. Of course, an additional separate selection<br>
among these flows may be performed, e.g. based on QoS requirements or even<br>
randomly. However, by using flow as an optimization variable, QoS aspects may be<br>
integrated directly into the joint optimization process, resulting in the selection of an<br>
optimal flow both from destination direction point of view and QoS point of view.<br>
It should be understood that the joint selection process may be performed directly by<br>
the transmitting node under consideration or by an associated control node responsible<br>
for one or more transmitting nodes.<br>
In a preferred realization, the transmitting node transmits an interrogation message to<br>
multiple relay candidate nodes in the network. The relay candidate nodes may for<br>
instance be selected based on multi-hop cost information obtained from an underlying<br>
route determination protocol, perhaps together with additional information. Each relay<br>
candidate node then replies, in response to the interrogation message (provided that it<br>
was received), with a response message either to the transmitting node itself or to a<br>
control node responsible for the transmitting node. The joint selection process is then<br>
performed, either by the transmitting node itself or by the control node, based on the<br>
response messages from the relay candidate nodes. Preferably, each relay candidate<br>
node determines link performance representing information for the corresponding link<br>
between the transmitting node and the relay candidate node based on the received<br>
interrogation message, and replies with this link performance infonnation.<br>
Alternatively, the transmitting node itself determines link performance information<br>
based on the received response message from the candidate node, assuming link<br>
reciprocity (and having some notion of noise plus interference characteristics at the<br>
relay node).<br>
hi a fully centralized architecture, cost information, information on which<br>
destinations/flows that are represented in the respective transmitting nodes as well as<br>
relevant link performance information are transmitted to a central control node, which<br>
may then perform selection of destination/flow, relay node, and optional link<br>
parameters for each of the transmitting nodes in the multi-hop network. Apparently,<br>
the central control node has to transfer information on selected destination/flow and<br>
relay node and optional link parameters to the respective transmitting nodes.<br>
Normally, the transmitting nodes in the multi-hop network, or at least a sub-set of<br>
transmitting nodes, are operated for time-synchronized transmission of interrogation<br>
messages as well as time-synchronized transmission of data. It is also important that<br>
the SNR/SINR or other link performance indicator reported during the interrogation<br>
response phase remains the same (or is improved) over the whole data phase.<br>
Therefore, each interrogation message is preferably transmitted using one or more<br>
predetermined transmit parameters such as transmit power level and/or antenna<br>
weights. During the subsequent data phase, substantially the same transmit parameter<br>
or parameters are then typically re-used for transmitting the selected data. In this way,<br>
the SNR/SINR may e.g. be improved if some node decides not to transmit, but can<br>
generally not be worsened.<br>
It has been recognized that the invention can also be combined with and adapted to<br>
handle multi-user detection on the receiver side. In this case, a receiving node that<br>
receives interrogation messages from multiple transmitting nodes generally determines<br>
link performance information such as SNR/SINR or rate information for each link. In a<br>
practically feasible implementation, the receiving node simply replies only to node(s)<br>
that is/are associated with high performance link(s).<br>
The invention'offers the following advantages:<br>
• Efficient multi-hop forwarding;<br>
• Increased network performance;<br>
• Increased throughput and/ or reduced delay;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Throughout the drawings, the same reference characters will be used for corresponding<br>
or similar elements.<br>
The invention relates to multi-hop networks such as packet radio multi-hop networks,<br>
and more particularly to a novel forwarding scheme for multi-hop networks called<br>
multi-user diversity forwarding (denoted MDF).<br>
The MDF scheme proposed by the invention can be used together with any underlying<br>
route determination protocol such as a shortest path protocol that generates routing<br>
cost tables or a route determination protocol more customized to diversity forwarding.<br>
Naturally, the invention may be arranged in association with other network-related<br>
functions such as topology control mechanisms.<br>
The multi-user diversity forwarding (MDF) scheme proposed by the invention<br>
integrates aspects on at least two of the three lowest protocol layers. Typically, these<br>
three layers refer to the OSI (Open System Interconnect) model and include the physical<br>
layer, the link layer and the network layer.<br>
At the core, we find a forwarding algorithm that investigates which destinations/flows<br>
that are represented in the transmitting node and selects relay direction through a wise<br>
choice of destination/flow. The forwarding algorithm jointly selects i) a relay node<br>
among multiple relay candidate nodes and ii) depending on application and desired<br>
degree of flexibility in the optimization at least one of a) destination among multiple<br>
destinations and b) flow among multiple flows, preferably together with iii) one or<br>
more link parameters. In conjunction thereto, a set of information for transmission,<br>
such as a data packet, is selected from the transmit queue based on selected destination<br>
and/or flow. This may be a set of information destined for a selected destination and/or<br>
a set of information belonging to the selected flow. The selected data is finally<br>
transmitted to the selected relay node, which takes on responsibility for further<br>
forwarding of the data in the multi-hop network (unless it is the destination).<br>
Naturally, if the selected candidate node is the destination node, the destination node<br>
does not forward the information any further. In its most elaborated form, the<br>
invention thus allows for selection among relays for multiple packets, while<br>
simultaneously adapting link parameters for optimal communication.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example. In addition to information on<br>
which flows and/or destinations that are represented in the transmitting node and cost<br>
information from an underlying route/cost determination protocol, the selection<br>
process is normally based on information representing link performance between the<br>
transmitting node under consideration and each one of the relay candidate nodes. For<br>
this reason, communication is preferably divided into three or four phases, an<br>
interrogation phase, a response phase, a data phase and an optional acknowledgement<br>
phase, as schematically illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The above three or four phases preferably take place within a time slot or other period<br>
of time that has a shorter duration than the channel coherence time, and the timeslots<br>
are repeated consecutively after each other. Note that the phases may optionally be<br>
ordered to span other arrangements than a single timeslot. In this case, however, at<br>
least the first phase and the third phase should preferably experience a stable channel<br>
(i.e. within the coherence time of the channel) and the same (or very similar)<br>
interference situation. The focus in the following will however be on the four-phase<br>
protocol within a timeslot, but not limited thereto.<br>
The two initial phases are typically designed to inquire and retrieve link performance<br>
information such as channel and transmission information in relation to each one of<br>
the relay candidate nodes, e.g. through the report of expected SNR/SINR or<br>
alternatively by indicating a supported transmission rate. Once a selection of<br>
destination/flow, relay node and a suitable set of information from the transmit queue<br>
is completed with or without integrated link adaptation, the information is transmitted<br>
to the relay node in the data phase. If link adaptation is used, a suitable link mode<br>
and/or other link parameters are selected based on the reported SNR/SINR or rate prior<br>
to transmission of the data. If desired, a selected relay node may acknowledge<br>
reception of data in the optional acknowledgement phase. Instead of reporting<br>
SNR/SINR, an optimal rate (link mode) could alternatively be reported directly, as<br>
previously mentioned.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an example of a four-phase scheme involving a number of transmittuig<br>
nodes and a number of potential receiving nodes. The scheme is shown for a number of<br>
transmitting nodes TXi to TXN, where each transmitting node transmits an<br>
interrogation message to a number of potential receiving nodes. For simplicity, only<br>
receiving nodes RXij, RXi^ and RXi&gt;3 for transmitting node TXi are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Each receiving node estimates the SNR/SINR and reports the estimated SNR/SENR to<br>
the corresponding transmitting node, which then selects a combination of<br>
destination/flow, relay node, and optional link mode for transmission of data to the<br>
selected relay node. Based on the selected destination/flow, the transmitting node<br>
extracts a set of information from the transmit queue, and finally transmits the data hi<br>
the data phase.<br>
hi order to ensure substantially the same interference conditions during both the<br>
interrogation phase and the subsequent data phase, the transmitting nodes should<br>
preferably transmit their frames in a time-synchronized manner, and substantially the<br>
same transmit power level and/or antenna weights should be used during both phases.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 2, the transmitting nodes TXi to TXx transmit their frames in such<br>
a way that the time slots are time-aligned. This provides a basis for correlation<br>
between the interrogation phase and the data phase. In addition, one or more transmit<br>
parameters such as transmit power level and/or antenna weights are initially<br>
determined and used both during the interrogation phase and the data phase so that the<br>
SNR/SINR reported during the interrogation response phase remains the same (or is<br>
improved) over the whole data phase.<br>
For example, if node TX,- hi a multi-hop network has decided to transmit in timeslot n,<br>
it may select a transmit power P,- for the subsequent data transmission. The transmit<br>
power PI may or may not, depending on choice, be allowed to vary from transmission<br>
to transmission, (where the non-varying case is treated as a special case of the varying<br>
case). For instance, PI may, and preferably should reflect topology changes and depend<br>
on transmit buffer content, previous failed transmissions and/or QoS factors. It is also<br>
possible to allow some nodes to adopt a low or alternatively high power approach,<br>
depending on whether power consumption or performance is the most relevant factor<br>
for the node in question. In addition, other transmit parameters apart from transmit<br>
power may be selected, such as antenna weights, allowing certain sets of potential<br>
relaying nodes to be targeted. Information on potential relay nodes may be derived<br>
from earlier derived topology information but may also be influenced by transmit<br>
buffer content, previous failed transmissions and QoS factors. The decision to transmit<br>
requires that packets are waiting in the transmit buffer, and may also depend on the<br>
medium access principle that has been adopted, e.g. slotted ALOHA with randomly<br>
drawn transmit instances.<br>
In order to enable the receiving candidate nodes to identify which node that sent the<br>
interrogation message, an explicit address may be appended to the message or a locally<br>
unique word (used for correlation by the receiver).<br>
The interrogation phase may adopt different methods, wherein a first exemplary<br>
method is based on the idea that each transmitting station or node transmits an<br>
interrogation message at transmit power Pt. A receiving node RXy may then identify<br>
the node that sent the interrogation message and at what power level it was received.<br>
In a second exemplary interrogation phase method, the transmitter address is included<br>
in the interrogation message. The interrogation messages from various transmitting<br>
nodes are subsequently transmitted in such a way that they are preferably (locally)<br>
non-colliding, e.g. through support of a suitable collision-free protocol. In addition,<br>
each message conveys information of transmit power level P{ to be used for<br>
subsequent data transmission. Based on this information, similar to the first<br>
interrogation phase method, a receiving node RXy may identify which node that sent<br>
the interrogation message and at what power level a subsequent data packet is<br>
expected to be received. If desired, method two interrogation messages may also<br>
contain information of desired receiver nodes or stations.<br>
Note that the interrogation message in the second method may be sent on a different<br>
(generally higher) power level compared to the power level for the data message,<br>
provided that an appropriate offset indication is included in the interrogation message<br>
or mat the offset is implicitly known beforehand. This provides an SNR improvement<br>
for the interrogation message phase, and also offers a greater flexibility.<br>
In the following we will focus on the second method due to its greater flexibility.<br>
In the response phase, each node sends a response message, preferably including<br>
SNR/SINR information. In an alternative embodiment, each candidate node<br>
determines which rate that can be used for reception (as channel frequency selectivity<br>
may easily be incorporated in the decision), and then responds with the rate instead.<br>
The rate may be an explicit value or an implicit code for some combination of<br>
modulation (QSPK, 8PSK, 16QAM, ...) and forward error correcting code<br>
(convolutional coding, Turbo coding, ...) and encoding rates. In a further alternative<br>
embodiment, the channel estimate is returned, enabling more efficient rate or link<br>
mode selection at the transmit side. For frequency division schemes such - as<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), a frequency-dependent<br>
SNR/SINR representation may be returned, enabling efficient selection of a sub-carrier<br>
(frequency channel) or a set of sub-carriers for a user.<br>
In the following, we assume the SNR/SINR reporting for brevity. The precise way in<br>
which SNR/SINR is reported depends on the type of detector used at the receiver. In a<br>
first case, single user detection is deployed and in a second case multi-user detection<br>
(MUD) may be used. If the receiver side uses the single user detection method, then<br>
the determined SNR/SINR is sent together with the address to which the SNR/SINR<br>
belongs. If MUD receivers are exploited, then a vector of SNR/SINR values with the<br>
associated transmitters may be conveyed. The SNR/SINR is then defined as receive<br>
power level to the sum of noise and the power of all weaker interfering signals for the<br>
signal of interest (see Appendix). For the single user detector case, the SNR/SINR is<br>
defined as the strongest received signal to the sum of power of interfering signals and<br>
noise. Rather than indicating SNR/SINR levels, explicit power levels may naturally be<br>
indicated instead together with an indication of the noise level. The responses are<br>
preferably sent, such that local collisions are avoided, by means of a suitable collision<br>
free protocol.<br>
Based on for example the SNR/SINR levels or returned rate information in the<br>
responses, each transmitter now perform two or preferably three decisions in a joint<br>
process (if MUD receivers are exploited then this shall also be considered in the<br>
decision process):<br>
- selecting destination/flow, and based thereon which packet or more generally<br>
which set of information in the queue to transmit,<br>
- selecting which relay node that will receive the packet and forward (unless it is<br>
the destination station) it, and<br>
- optionally deciding which additional link parameters apart from the<br>
predetermined transmit power level to use. Preferably, the additional link<br>
parameters include link mode parameters such as data signal constellation and<br>
forward error correcting coding, but may also include for example frequency<br>
channel parameters. If additional link parameters can not be selected, only the<br>
first two steps are executed.<br>
For rate or link adaptation, the transmitter may also include more exact channel state<br>
knowledge, either returned in the response message or an estimation of the channel<br>
when the response message is received, assuming channel reciprocity is a valid<br>
assumption.<br>
In the data phase, the selected packet is transmitted to the determined relay node using<br>
the assigned link and transmit parameters.<br>
In the acknowledgement phase, the receiving node responds with an acknowledgement<br>
indicating whether the packet was received correctly or not<br>
In the above, semi-stationary conditions over at least one timeslot are assumed as well as reasonably good accuracy of relative measurement and transmit power settings.<br>
It should be noted that, for interrogation method two, multiple consecutive<br>
interrogation packets can be transmitted in the interrogation phase. In the samesway,<br>
multiple response messages can be transmitted in the response phase as well as<br>
multiple acknowledgements in the acknowledgement phase.<br>
Figs. 3A-B outline the principles of an exemplary forwarding method according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention on the transmitter side and receiver side,<br>
respectively. The principles will now be outlined briefly, starting on the transmit side.<br>
One or more suitable transmit parameters such as transmit power and/or antenna<br>
weights are initially determined in step SI. In step S2, an interrogation message is<br>
sent, typically by means of broadcasting or multicasting. In step S3, a corresponding<br>
response message, including e.g. SNR/SINR or rate information, is received from one<br>
or more potential relay nodes. In step S4 the joint selection process is performed to<br>
determine which data to transmit as well as relay node and link parameters. In step S5,<br>
a data packet heading for a selected destination or belonging to a selected flow is<br>
transmitted to the selected relay node using the initially determined transmit<br>
parameters and the selected link parameters. In step S6, an acknowledgement is<br>
received. In step S7, possible ARQ actions may be performed.<br>
On the receive side, the interrogation message is received in step SI 1. In step SI2, a<br>
SNR/SINR value, supported rate or other suitable parameter is determined in response<br>
to the received interrogation message. In step S13, the SNR/SINR or rate is reported to<br>
the transmitting node in a response message. If the relay node has been selected by the<br>
transmitting node, a data packet is received in step S14. In step SI5, an<br>
acknowledgement is sent to the transmitting node indicating that the packet was<br>
correctly received. Possible ARQ actions are taken on the receive side hi step SI6.<br>
As the ARQ (Automatic repeat Request) scheme may be selected from a range of<br>
ARQ schemes, the ARQ details are not indicated. The basic function is to ensure that a<br>
packet is retransmitted until a positive acknowledgement is received (though, an upper<br>
limit of the number of retransmissions may be employed) and then the packet may<br>
optionally be removed from the transmit buffer. The ARQ functionality may have<br>
functions on the transmit side as well as on the receive side as customary.<br>
Of course, other transmit parameters than transmit power may be used by the<br>
invention, for example antenna weights. Also, it should be understood that rate or link<br>
adaptation is an optional, but often preferred feature.<br>
Apart from an opportunistic choice among multiple relay nodes, which is similar to<br>
SDF proposed in [8], the invention gives at least two additional main benefits.<br>
The first comes from the opportunity to choose among multiple packets (and hence<br>
flows/destinations) present in the transmit buffer. The main reason for this added<br>
degree of freedom lies in the fact that different packets (or more generally different<br>
sets of data) may be heading in various directions from the transmitting node, thus<br>
enabling selection of relay node hi several general forwarding directions.<br>
This benefit is easily appreciated from Figs. 4A-B with a simple geographic-based<br>
forward progress metric, where Fig. 4A shows the SDF method proposed in [8] and<br>
Fig. 4B shows the method according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
In the prior art of Fig. 4A, the first packet PCK X in the transmit queue is the packet to<br>
be transmitted. This packet belongs to a given flow and is destined for a given<br>
destination node, which then determines the general forwarding direction for packet<br>
PCK X. The transmitting node selects among a number of potential relay nodes that<br>
give a forward progress in this general direction. The transmitting node typically<br>
transmits the packet to the relay node with maximum forward progress, here simply<br>
meaning that the packet is transported the longest projected distance in the direction of<br>
the destination node of the packet<br>
In the invention, it is possible to select relay node in all destination/flow directions of<br>
the packets represented in the transmit queue 110 of the considered transmitting node.<br>
For example, the transmit queue may be packet-based (1) with different packets ready<br>
for transmission. Alternatively, the transmit queue comprises a number of buffers (2),<br>
each buffer holding data for a given destination or flow. In the second alternative, data<br>
from the various buffers are later encapsulated into packet form, once a suitable link<br>
mode scheme has been selected. The transmitting node 100 maintains a list of<br>
destinations/flows currently represented in the node, thus allowing selection among the<br>
different destinations/flows. This in effect enables selection of relay node in several<br>
general forwarding directions. From Fig. 4B, it can be seen that packet PCK Y is<br>
destined for a destination in a completely different direction than packet PCK X. In<br>
this direction, there is a relay node 200 that gives an absolute maximum forward<br>
progress, close to the transmit range of the transmitting node 100. From a forward<br>
progress point of view, it is thus clearly more advantageous to transmit packet PCK Y<br>
than PCK X.<br>
In addition, it is also possible to consider for example QoS (Quality of Service)<br>
aspects, since for example different flows may have different QoS requirements, as<br>
well as fairness between destinations and/or flows. The selection of destination/flow<br>
ultimately translates into a selection of data from the transmit queue. It is hence<br>
possible, based on what transmissions that are perceived to succeed, to<br>
opportunistically determine the most optimum packet to send.<br>
A second main benefit of the invention is that link performance can be optimized, in<br>
conjunction with selection of which packet to transmit and which relay node to use.<br>
In order to be able to speak about optimality in a well-defined manner, it is desirable to<br>
introduce an objective function / In general, the objective function / is carefully<br>
selected and made dependent on a) some given input parameters characterizing the<br>
(wireless/radio) multi-hop network, and b) some variables that can be carefully<br>
selected to optimize the objective function/<br>
In this particular example, the multi-hop network is characterized hi that each relay<br>
node has at least an associated cost towards at least one destination. Other information<br>
such as local load, queuing status, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements or remaining<br>
battery, could also be incorporated into the objective function.<br>
The optimization variables include at least relay node and flow and/or destination. If<br>
multiple flows are supported for some destination(s), the selection may then be a<br>
combination of flow and destination. If destination is used as optimization variable<br>
instead of flow, the selection result includes a selected destination, but there may be<br>
several flows to the selected destination and it is thus still an open question as to which<br>
flow to select. Of course, an additional separate selection among these flows may be<br>
performed, e.g. based on QoS requirements or even randomly. However, by using flow<br>
as an optimization variable, QoS aspects may be integrated directly into the joint<br>
optimization process, resulting in the selection of an optimal flow both from<br>
destination direction point of view and QoS point of view.<br>
In addition, rate may if desired be included as a variable. Rates are then determined by<br>
any appropriate combination of modulation, coding and spreading scheme. Moreover,<br>
given that an optimum rate has been selected, it is allowed for the transmitting node to<br>
(only) reduce it's transmit power if the link SNR/SINR exceeds what is needed for the<br>
selected optimum rate. We generally call parameters such as modulation, coding and<br>
spreading scheme, transmit power, antenna weights and frequency channel parameters<br>
for link parameters. The term "link parameters" thus includes DLC (Data Link<br>
Control) parameters on the data link layer as well as underlying physical PHY layer<br>
parameters. The DLC parameters include both LLC (Logical Link Control) parameters<br>
and MAC (Medium Access Control) parameters, and hence a link parameter may be<br>
selected from LLC, MAC and PHY parameters.<br>
The output from the objective function includes a selected relay node and a selected<br>
destination or flow to a destination. The selection of destination or. flow affects which<br>
information that is sent. In addition, the optimization of the objective function can also<br>
provide an appropriate combination of modulation, coding and spreading scheme, i.e.<br>
rate selection, as well as an appropriate set of sub carriers or frequency channels to be<br>
used. As a result of the rate selection, a reduction hi transmit power is yet another and<br>
additional output.<br>
When formalizing an optimization considering relay node, flow and link parameters,<br>
the following notations may be used:<br>
denotes the set of all nodes in the network (or the considered part of the<br>
network).<br>
jt is the set of candidate relay nodes, i.e. nodes responding to node v, :s<br>
probe, V (sF-<br>
&amp;{ is the set of flows in node Vj , v; e V •<br>
yr denotes one or a multitude of link parameters, and may thus be<br>
multidimensional with respect to link parameters, each variable<br>
parameter as such having a definition space in which it may assume<br>
continuous or discrete values. The link parameter can depend on the<br>
transmitter v, v, eF"and receiver v,eF nodes, then denoted<br>
The objective function/is then optimized for forwarding on behalf of node y, using<br>
input parameters from the above sets j , 4^ and «P to jointly determine an optimal<br>
combination of relay node j , flow as well as link parameters:<br>
where:<br>
defines the set of link parameter values for node y/ a and may include<br>
transmission and/or reception parameters:<br>
Quality Cost Progress<br>
An example of a special objective function is Quality Cost Progress (ZQCP)- The<br>
Quality Cost Progress (QCP) between node y. and node v,, for flow p. e^ is<br>
defined as:<br>
where:<br>
C,(p/) is the cost from node v, , v, e F  to the destination for flow<br>
pl e D; • Each flow is associated with a destination.<br>
is the quality (e.g. signal-to-interference and noise ratio) of the<br>
link between node v, and node v . <br>
is weighting parameters for node v, , v. e V , and for flow 9?, e <d>, •<br>
The weighting parameters may be any combination of at least fixed prioritization<br>
weights, adaptive prioritization weights, QoS-related parameters (such as due time,<br>
latency etc), fairness criteria and so forth. It may be somewhat more natural and<br>
straightforward to incorporate QoS parameters in the optimization when considering<br>
flow as an optimization variable, since each flow is normally associated with given<br>
QoS requirements.<br>
This allows us to write the optimization (here assumed to be a maximization) of the<br>
objective function based on QCP as:<br>
= max fef},<br>
which results in a combination of relay node, flow and one or more link parameters.<br>
CCPn"' is negative, no forwarding is executed.<br>
Another exemplary objective function is based on the Information Cost Progress<br>
(ZICP) The following additional notation may be used:<br>
r is the signal-to-noise+interference ratio (SENR) in this example. The<br>
SINR can then be an instantaneous or average SINR. For example, the<br>
SINR can be determined by letting all relay stations intending to transmit,<br>
sending a (multicast/broadcast) interrogation message that enables the<br>
instant SNR to be measured.<br>
R is the set of achievable rates between node y, and node Vj, given by the<br>
SINR The rates are constructed by combination of modulation,<br>
coding and spreading schemes.<br>
The Information Cost Progress (ICP) between node y{ and node vy, for flowe <br>
using rate r is defined as:<br>
This allows us to write the optimization (here assumed to be a maximization) of the<br>
objective function based on ICP as:<br>
which results in a combination of relay node, flow and a selected rate. Note if <br>
negative, no forwarding is executed.<br>
When using cost progress in some form, cost information may be provided by an<br>
independent route determination protocol such as any well known shortest path<br>
protocol (e.g. Bellman Ford), e.g. using energy, delay or hop metric, or a route<br>
determination protocol more customized to diversity forwarding.<br>
The route determination protocol or alternatively another topology control protocol<br>
may provide the basic setting of transmit power.<br>
In addition, other selection criteria may be employed in determining which packet to<br>
send. As previously mentioned, an important selection criterion may be QoS, i.e.<br>
giving priority for packets with certain delivery requirements on e.g. delay or<br>
bandwidth. Hence, the cost progress metric may be combined with QoS parameters,<br>
such as delay or due time data as an extended QoS metric. Moreover, it is of course<br>
important to provide some sort of fairness towards sources in the network so as to<br>
avoid starvation, channel capture and so forth.<br>
Apparently, the use of flow as an optimization variable implicitly results in a selection<br>
of destination direction, since each flow has a unique destination. Alternatively,<br>
destination can be used directly as an optimization variable in order to consider<br>
direction, as will be exemplified below.<br>
A particular example of an information cost progress function, defined as the rate<br>
times the differential cost progress (cost reduction from transmitting node i to<br>
receiving node j, assuming cost that increases from the destination), is given below:<br>
where Z is the information cost progress for a packet heading in the direction<br>
towards destination D and where i is the transmitting node and j is an interrogated<br>
node. Furthermore, rSNRg/SMR is a supported rate between node / to node j for a<br>
given SNR/SINR between node i and node j. This function could for example be<br>
jointly optimized with respect to relay node, destination node and rate. The costs to<br>
destination node D and the objective function / could reflect any of a multitude of<br>
factors. For instance, the costs and the objective function may reflect the forward<br>
progress in geographic distance, but other cost progress measure may also be used.<br>
Forward progress in geographic distance may for example be determined based on<br>
position information such as GPS (Global Positioning System) information or<br>
estimated based on path loss calculations.<br>
The information cost progress measure is determined, after a node has received one or<br>
more response messages with expected SNR/SINR values, but before the subsequent<br>
data message is being transmitted. Practically, this usually means that the transmitter<br>
goes through the buffer and determines the cost progress for each packet. As several<br>
packets may have the same destination, it suffices to determine the measure for the<br>
most important "same destination" packet, but still doing so for all destinations or<br>
flows represented in the buffer.<br>
In reference [12], the optimal transmission range and code rates where investigated in<br>
a highly loaded frequency hopping packet radio network by a so-called information<br>
efficiency forward progress performance measure. The difference here is that we do<br>
not use information efficiency forward progress as a performance measure, but rather<br>
as an objective function to be optimized. This is made possible due to the<br>
interrogation-response phase and the selection among multiple relay candidate nodes.<br>
The rational behind an objective function based on information forward progress is<br>
that the "speed over ground" for a packet or, equivalency the rate times the traversed<br>
distance towards the destination, shall be as high as possible. The expression for<br>
information forward progress defined below is useful for evaluation purposes and<br>
illustrates the existence of a maximum. Note that the analysis of the metric in the<br>
following does not follow reference [12]. Assume for example that an infinite number<br>
of relay nodes are positioned along a line in the desired direction of routing, and one is<br>
searching the optimum node to send to as well as at what rate should be used. A good<br>
measure to use is then the information forward progress, Z, given by Shannon's<br>
channel capacity formula times the hop-distance:<br>
where P is the transmit power, N is the noise power, a is the propagation constant<br>
(typically between 2-4 and 2 for free space propagation), Const is a propagation<br>
constant, B is the bandwidth and R is the distance between the transmitter and receiver.<br>
With 5=20 MHz, N=k-T-B-NF (where NF=W dB, 7273+25 K, M.38e-23), QF=2.6<br>
the optima for different transmit power levels are clearly evident in Fig. 5.<br>
The maximum forward progress can however itself not be expressed in a closed form.<br>
However, the optimum distance ROpt can yield the upper bound of the channel<br>
efficiency as:<br>
This illustrates that large signal constellations is generally not needed, i.e. for cp=2, a<br>
signal constellation with 3 bps/Hz will suffice. Even though the link optimization was<br>
exemplified with a cost metric based on distance and information, other metrics<br>
meeting similar objective criteria may be used.<br>
As link adaptation may be employed, functionality for fragmentation, assembling and<br>
possibly also multiplexing/de-multiplexing will be exercised by the nodes at<br>
communication.<br>
It will now be illustrated that the proposed invention also has benefits in a (Rayleigh)<br>
fading environment. One may for simplicity of the analysis assume that the sending<br>
node has large number of concentric circles where potential receiving nodes may be<br>
positioned. The optimum information forward progress can be estimated with the<br>
relation:<br>
where<br>
is the information forward progress and<br>
is the pdf (power density function) for selection diversity with order M diversity and<br>
is the average SNR/SINR as a function of distance R and<br>
• M = Const -R2<br>
is the average number of nodes on a concentric circle at distance R. This means that<br>
the diversity order increases radically for large distances, but is also dependent of the<br>
density of nodes, reflected in the parameter Const.<br>
Numerical calculation gives the curves in Fig. 6 for the same parameters as above,<br>
with P=1W, and several Const values. Note that in practice, diversity order will be<br>
limited in contrast to the case when using a mathematically defined pdf for the<br>
SNR/SINR that has a very long tail with a non-zero value for high SNR/SINR values.<br>
It is in any case clear that diversity increases information forward progress.<br>
Optimizations<br>
As large quantities of control messages are sent, it is vital to keep the overhead and<br>
energy consumption as small as possible. This may be achieved by miriimizing the<br>
quantities of information in the packets by implicit signaling. For instance, instead of<br>
using the full address of the candidate nodes, one may use locally (and uniquely)<br>
assigned addresses (e.g. under the control of a route determination protocol). Since the<br>
addresses are local, short addresses will be sufficient. Another method is to transmit to<br>
only those candidate nodes that have a positive cost progress or a cost progress within<br>
a specific range or interval (e.g. exceeding a positive threshold). Hence, the address<br>
field is replaced with a shorter cost requirement field. One may also address candidate<br>
nodes implicitly by indicating that they are (a set of) neighbors of some neighbor of a<br>
transmitting node. For example, a candidate node is explicitly addressed in the packet,<br>
and one or more other suitable relay candidate nodes are implicitly addressed by<br>
indicating in the packet that they are neighbors of the explicitly addressed candidate<br>
node. This requires a protocol to be executed that establishes neighbor relations, e.g.<br>
an incorporated function in a route determination protocol, as well known in Internet<br>
(Hello messages). This means that the overhead does not have to be as large as one<br>
may first assume.<br>
It should also be noted that the steps preceding t], i.e. what triggers a node to transmit,<br>
normally depend on what channel or medium access method that is used. For example,<br>
Slotted ALOHA, CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) or even a scheme with<br>
scheduled transmit occasions (like in STDMA) may be used.<br>
The invention enables cluster of nodes to act cooperatively together to improve<br>
communication fidelity, e.g. through diversity. A further option is to assign<br>
predetermined stations exercising control functions by receiving and transmitting<br>
control messages.<br>
Queuing disciplines are important since they are the key to fairly share the network<br>
resources and provide performance critical applications with performance guarantees.<br>
Generally, one makes a difference between queuing disciplines developed for besteffort<br>
applications (i.e. applications without QoS requirements) and disciplines<br>
developed for guaranteed-service applications (i.e. applications with QoS<br>
requirements). For best-effort connections the most important objective is to share the<br>
resources in a fair manner, and examples of queuing algorithms developed for this<br>
service type are: 1) Weighted Round Robin; 2) Deficit Round Robin; and 3) Weighted<br>
Fair Queuing, all of them trying to emulate the Generalised Processor Sharing<br>
algorithm. Naturally, for guaranteed-service applications the most important objective<br>
is to give performance guarantees, and examples of queuing disciplines fulfilling this<br>
task are: 1) Weighted Fair Queuing; 2) Virtual Clock; and 3) Earliest Due Date.<br>
Implementational aspects<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic block diagram of relevant parts on the transmitter side according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The transmitting node 100 of Fig. 7 basically<br>
comprises a general controller 105, a transmit buffer 110, an interrogation/probe unit<br>
120, an encapsulation unit 130, a coder and modulation unit 140, a conventional<br>
transmission chain 150 connected to an antenna or antenna system, a transmit parameter<br>
controller 160, a conventional receiver chain 170, a demodulation and decoder unit 180,<br>
a unit 190 for performing a joint decision process to select data, relay node and optional<br>
link mode, a receive buffer 192 and a unit 194 for providing multi-hop cost information.<br>
In the first round (1), an interrogation probe is transferred to the encapsulation unit 130<br>
for encapsulation and (explicit and/or implicit) addressing. From an addressing<br>
perspective, the transmitting node typically employs broadcasting or multicasting to<br>
transmit the interrogation message to selected relay candidate nodes in the multi-hop<br>
network. The relay candidate nodes may for instance be selected by the general<br>
controller 105 based on multi-hop cost information obtained from an underlying route<br>
determination protocol, perhaps together with additional information. The encapsulated<br>
interrogation probe is transferred to the coder and modulation unit 140 for coding 142<br>
and modulation 144, and further on to the transmission chain 150 for transmission<br>
towards the relay candidate nodes. The transmit power level and/or antenna weights used<br>
for transmission are given by the transmit parameter controller 160.<br>
hi the second round (2), the transmitting node 100 receives response messages from a<br>
number of relay candidate nodes via the receiver chain 170 and the unit 180 for<br>
demodulation 182 and decoding 184. The response messages are then transferred to the<br>
decision unit 190, which then selects data, relay node and optionally also link mode for<br>
transmission in a joint decision process. Preferably, the decision unit 190 performs a joint<br>
optimization based on for example cost progress, as previously described in detail. In the<br>
decision/optimization process, the decision unit 190 normally makes use of link<br>
performance information such as SNR/SINR reported in the response messages,<br>
information on which destinations/flows that are represented in the node as well as multihop<br>
cost information from an underlying route determination protocol such as Belhnari-<br>
Ford or similar protocol. In the transmitting node 100, such cost information is preferably<br>
gathered and/or generated in the multi-hop cost information unit 194, which is connected<br>
to the decision unit 190. Information on selectable destinations and/or flows can be<br>
retrieved, e.g. by investigating the transmit queue or by maintaining a separate list of<br>
destinations/flows currently present in the node.<br>
The selected data is then transferred from the transmit queue 110 to the encapsulation<br>
unit 130, which encapsulates the data and sets the address to the selected relay node. The<br>
encapsulated packet information is then transferred to the coder and modulation unit 140,<br>
which performs coding and modulation according to the selected link mode before the<br>
packet information is transmitted to the selected relay node.<br>
In the third round (3), a data acknowledgement received from the selected relay node<br>
may optionally be employed for removing corresponding data from the transmit queue<br>
110. <br>
Individual control and information units, such as the transmit parameter controller 160,<br>
the joint decision process unit 190 and the multi-hop cost information unit 194 may<br>
cooperate with or even be integrated into the general controller 105, which in itself may<br>
include additional control functionality.<br>
Fig. 8 is a schematic block diagram of relevant parts on the receiver side according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention. The relay candidate node of Fig. 8 basically<br>
comprises a conventional receiver chain 210 connected to an antenna or antenna system,<br>
a link performance estimator 220, a unit 230 for demodulation and decoding, a receive<br>
buffer 240, an acknowledgement unit 250, a transmit node identifier unit 260, an<br>
encapsulation unit 270, a coder and modulation unit 280, a conventional transmission<br>
chain 290 connected to an antenna or antenna system, and a transmit queue 295.<br>
The relay candidate node receives an interrogation message from one or more<br>
transmitting nodes in the multi-hop network through the receiver chain 210. For<br>
multicasting, the relay candidate node includes functionality (not shown) for determining<br>
whether an interrogation message is intended for relay node by investigating explicit<br>
and/or implicit addressing information in the received interrogation message. In the<br>
following, we will consider the case when the interrogation message is actually intended<br>
for the relay candidate node.<br>
In round (1 A), the link performance estimator 220 estimates a link performance measure<br>
such as SNR/SINR (or alternatively transforms the SNR/SINR value into a supported<br>
rate) for transmission back to the interrogating node in a response message. The estimate<br>
is transferred to the encapsulation unit 270 for encapsulation and addressingsKGhe<br>
encapsulated response information is then transmitted to the interrogating transmit node<br>
by using the unit 280 for coding 282 and modulation 284, as well as the transmission<br>
chain 290.<br>
If the transmitter address is included in the interrogation message, the message is also<br>
transferred, in round (IB), via the unit 230 for demodulation 232 and decoding 234 to<br>
the receive buffer 240. The transmit node identifier unit 260 investigates the received<br>
interrogation message and extracts the transmitter address for transfer to the<br>
encapsulation unit 270. The transmitter address can then be used by the encapsulation<br>
unit 270 so that the response message reaches the interrogating transmit node.<br>
If the relay candidate node 200 is selected by the interrogating transmit node, the relay<br>
node typically receives a packet signal from the transmit node through the receiver chain<br>
210. hi the second round (2), the received packet signal is then demodulated and decoded<br>
into packet data that is transferred to the receive buffer 240. The acknowledgement unit<br>
250 may then issue a data acknowledgement (ACK) for transmission to the<br>
corresponding transmit node.<br>
The packet data in the receive buffer 240 may subsequently be transferred to the transmit<br>
queue 295 for later transmission to relay candidate nodes further on in the multi-hop<br>
network.<br>
It should be noted that the receiver may perform congestion control, e.g. when the<br>
receive buffer exceeds a given storage threshold. This maybe effectuated when receiving<br>
an interrogation message by not responding or by including in the response an indication<br>
that the receiver can not receive.<br>
Distributed selection process<br>
As mentioned earlier, it should be understood that the joint selection process may be<br>
distributed to an associated control node responsible for one or more transmitting<br>
nodes.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates the information flow for a control node responsible for the selection<br>
process for one or more transmitting nodes. The control node 300 is typically<br>
responsive to multi-hop cost information obtained e.g. from an underlying route<br>
determination protocol, information on which destinations/flows that are represented<br>
in the respective transmitting nodes as well as link performance information as<br>
reported through response messages. This means that relay candidate nodes may send<br>
their response messages to the control node 300. The control node 300 may then<br>
perform the joint decision process to select a combination of destination/flow, relay<br>
node, and optional link parameters for each transmitting node associated with the<br>
control node. Finally, the control node, which may have a more or less central role,<br>
transfers information, on selected destination/flow, relay node and optional link<br>
parameters to each of its associated nodes.<br>
MDFandMUD<br>
As indicated above, MDF may be combined as well as adapted to handle the case of<br>
receivers employing multi-user detectors (MUD), i.e. capable of decoding multiple<br>
signals at the same time. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention with respect to<br>
MUD and MDF, a single fixed data rate (or upper limited rate) is used throughout the<br>
network and assumed to be known by all nodes. Assume that each one of a number of<br>
relay candidate nodes is capable of receiving and decoding interrogation messages<br>
from multiple transmitting nodes. Each node receiving multiple interrogation messages<br>
typically determines which transmitting nodes that can be decoded, and generally<br>
determines link performance information such as SNR/SINR or rate information for<br>
each link. In a practically feasible implementation, each receiving node determines a<br>
so-called SNR/SINR vector representing multiple received interrogation messages,<br>
and then selects to which interrogating node or nodes that a response message should<br>
be sent based on SNR/SINR, normally selecting only nodes with high performance<br>
links. The node .receiving the response message evaluates the message togethesswith<br>
possible other response messages from other candidate nodes, and checks to which<br>
relay node it may transmit and which data packet that is the most optimum to transmit<br>
After selecting a data packet, the transmitting node sends the packet and awaits an<br>
acknowledgment in response. In an extension of the above combined MDF and MUD<br>
scheme, a transmitting node determines link parameters including a desired rate to<br>
transmit with and conveys the rate information in the interrogation message. A node<br>
receiving multiple interrogation messages may then consider rate information in the<br>
process of determining feasible transmitters).<br>
MDF and other techniques<br>
If Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is used, the invention<br>
may further perform an opportunistic choice to select which sub-carrier (frequency<br>
channel) or set of sub-carriers (frequency channels) to use among multiple subcarriers,<br>
i.e. multiplexing data to multiple users on single OFDM symbols. In this case,<br>
the relay nodes are informed on the selection for correct decoding. The multiplexing<br>
structure may for example be indicated in the header of the data packet. Also, note that<br>
multiple destinations and/or flows may be targeted by using different parts of the<br>
spectrum, and the joint selection then takes this into account.<br>
38<br>
Also, the invention may be combined with standard SDF as outlined in [8], if extra<br>
control messages are (allowed to be) added or piggybacked on proposed MDF<br>
messages. In such a case, after the response phase, a^et of candidate nodes on which<br>
SDF acts on are selected.<br>
The novel forwarding scheme proposed by the invention may also be combined with<br>
beamforming. In MDF, a relay station may incorporate beamforming aspects when<br>
preparing for a transmission. In doing so, apart from selecting a power level and a<br>
beam direction, the beam parameters can be selected to ensure that a sufficient and<br>
appropriate number of potential relay nodes or stations are likely to be encountered.<br>
This means that there is an interplay between antenna-gain and antenna-beamwidth.<br>
The specific choice of antenna transmit parameters may be random, but preferably<br>
reflects topology and incorporates QoS aspects. N.B. the same transmit parameters<br>
adhere to the transmission of the interrogation message as well as the data message.<br>
Alternatively, MDF can also be used in the context of MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple<br>
Output) communication in selecting a single flow to a user.<br>
General discussion on differences between MDF and prior art<br>
Further to the fact that no prior art technique allows joint selection of a combination of<br>
destination/flow among multiple destinations/flows, relay node among multiple relay<br>
candidate nodes as well as optional link parameters, a number of additional differences<br>
will be summarized below:<br>
Differences between MDF and HSDPA/HDR/Opportunistic Beamforming<br>
• HSDPA, HDR and Opportunistic Beamforming (OB) are aimed for cellular<br>
network, whereas MDF targets;<br>
o a multi-hop network with,<br>
o a distributed multiple access protocol and with,<br>
o potentially mobile stations.<br>
• HSDPA, HDR and OB must send any packet directly to its destination mobile<br>
station (MS), whereas MDF may select among multiple relay nodes (which does<br>
not make sense and is not possible in HSDPA, HDR or OB at all). This means<br>
that MDF can offer a higher degree of diversity as well as additional degrees of<br>
freedom in selecting receive node. The larger flexibility (implied by the<br>
additional degrees of freedom) may also be used to shape and enhance QoS in<br>
greater extent to the more limited choice offered in HSDPA and alike.<br>
• HSDPA and HDR normally has no coordination between base stations and a<br>
slower control cycle than that of MDF, which implies that the actual SNR/SENR<br>
situation may change from the reporting until data is transmitted. In MDF, the<br>
three/four-phase protocol ensures that reported SNR/SINR from, .the.<br>
interrogation response phase remains the same (or is improved) over the whole<br>
data phase. The SNR/SINR in MDF may e.g. be improved if some station decide<br>
not to transmit, but cannot be worsened.<br>
• HSDPA and HDR uses continuous uplink reporting of SNR/SINR information .<br>
for active HSDPA users, whereas the interrogation-response phases of MDF<br>
allow one to interrogate, on an instantaneous basis, a limited set of candidate<br>
stations of their respective instantaneous SNR/SINR. HSDPA may even have up<br>
to hundreds of stations continuously signaling their experienced SNR/SINR.<br>
N.B. As OB has not been realized in practice, and protocol aspects has not been<br>
discussed in any detail, it is not known how OB will behave. It has however been<br>
indicated that no changes to MS (probably meaning CDMA) are needed. This means<br>
that OB is likely to behave similar to HDR.<br>
Differences between MDF and opportune routing<br>
o Opportune routing generally uses a monitoring feature that acts on a slow time<br>
scale (meaning that it is a background activity) and that updates a relay station's<br>
routing database. In contrast, MDF uses a fast adaptation through the<br>
interrogation-response phase to perform fast local forwarding decisions.<br>
• Opportune routing does not support parallel transmissions, i.e. a packet (e.g.<br>
control or data) transmitted to at least two adjacent stations, whereas MDF may<br>
exploit the possibility of sending control packets (interrogation and response<br>
packets) to multiple adjacent stations.<br>
• Opportune routing does not employ broadcasting/multicasting of interrogation<br>
messages and/or data.<br>
Difference between MDF and SDF<br>
In relation to standard SDF, as outlined in [8], which is its closest relative, the<br>
proposed invention is guaranteed to always perform better than standard SDF - which<br>
itself has been shown to be superior to traditional shortest path routing schemes - given<br>
that the channel is stationary over the three/four phase exchange and that power level<br>
measurement and adjustment are precise.<br>
• The reason why the proposed invention performs better is that, in contrast to<br>
standard SDF in which a single packet at some data rate selects among a limited<br>
set of relays, the invention allows for selection among more relays for multiple<br>
packets while adaptively optimizing link parameters for optimal<br>
communication. Even with slight power measurement and adjustment errors,<br>
the performance is expected to be superior. The relative benefit of MDF over<br>
SDF will be most significant when the transmit power is low. This is so because<br>
at large communication ranges, even SDF with constrained "direction" of<br>
forwarding is likely to find multiple nodes near the communication range and in<br>
the right "direction".<br>
© Another difference is that the "standard SDF" (primarily) takes retroactive<br>
decisions and the invention here takes decision prior to the data transmission.<br>
Yet, in reference [8], an alternative embodiment of SDF based on multicast-<br>
RTS and unicast-CTS is also proposed. This is similar to IEEE802.il DCF,<br>
acquiring a floor, but enhanced with a multicast RTS and aimed for multi-hop<br>
routing. Even if the decision is taken in the same order, it lacks the selection<br>
among multiple packets as well as the suggested opportunistic link adaptation.<br>
In other words, SDF focuses on selecting relay node and performing forwarding for<br>
one packet at a time, whereas MDF may opportunistically select from multiple<br>
packets. In addition, in the main embodiment of SDF, the idea of a retroactive<br>
forwarding decision (after the data packet has been sent) is deployed. MDF on the<br>
other hand, decide exactly which packet to send (based on the interrogation-response<br>
process).<br>
In summary, exploiting multi-user diversity effects in general is a good feature. Apart<br>
from that, one can select relay direction (relay node) through a wise packet choice, and<br>
also exploit and benefit from a fading channel. Note that benefits in SNR/SINR comes<br>
both from fading peaks of the desired signal, and fading minima from interfering and<br>
undesired sources. In addition the scheme allows a metric to be defined and optimized<br>
for instantaneous SNR/SINR situations and its structure allows maximization of<br>
throughput and minimization of delay. A special example of such a metric may be a<br>
joint measure on the amount of information being sent in combination with the<br>
progress towards the destination source.<br>
Given the above, it should be recognized that the above invention may incorporate or<br>
exploit other aspects. For instance, other MAC protocols., such as Seedex [13], may be<br>
used. A variety of route determination protocols and cost metrics may be deployed.<br>
The invention may be combined with congestion control mechanisms, e.g. through<br>
adaptively varying the transmit probability. The invention may also send multiple<br>
packets consecutively in a time slot as long as there is space in the time slot and<br>
transmission adhere to given rules of the invention (i.e. multiplexing of several packets<br>
within one timeslot).<br>
The embodiments described above are merely given as examples, and it should be<br>
understood that the present invention is not limited thereto. Further modifications,<br>
changes and improvements which retain the basic underlying principles disclosed and<br>
claimed herein are within the scope of the invention.<br>
APPENDIX<br>
SNR MUD definition<br>
In order to define the SNR for a MUD decoder, the received signals are ordered<br>
according to the power levels:<br>
A list of the identities of the transmitting nodes is then assembled in accordance to the<br>
ordered list of receive powers. To each item in the list there is an associated<br>
defined according to:<br>
where N is the noise power, P^ is the receive power.<br>
The list of transmitter identities and the associated SNRs is then for example used by<br>
the node itself to select to which transmitting- node(s) it should respond, or<br>
multicasted/broadcasted in the response message. Alternatively, rates (or<br>
communication modes with some FEC and modulation) may be determined and sent<br>
back in the response message. This enables detailed channel aspects such as frequency<br>
selectivity to be taken into account.<br>
