				<td>The present invention relates to a Machine for Wet Treatment of Textile fabric in<br>
Roped Form with a closed vessel and a Venturi-Transport Jet System, which is impinged to the current of a transport medium, in order to drive the endless fabric rope circulating in the vessel in a given rotation direction.<br>
In actual practice such wet processing machine, known as Jet dyeing machines and similar ones, operate in several design forms, depending upon whether the transport medium is liquid or gaseous, in accordance with the hydraulic or aerodynamic principles. The endless fabric rope conveyed through the Transport Jet System is plaited when it exits from the Transport Jet System, through a plaiting machine and then stored in a storage, for, which it is continuously withdrawn and is fed to the fabric rope entry of the Transport Jet System. For the purpose of lifting the ropes from the Storage and its feeding into the start of the rope entry of the Transport Jet System, reel winders are allocated, generally one reel winder for each Transport Jet System. The electro-motor driven reel-winder is located in the fabric rope path before the fabric rope's entry into their relevant transport jet and deflects the fabric rope lifted from the Storage, mostly moving in the vertical direction by at least 900, before it enters the fabric rope entry of the Transport Jet. Between the Reel winder and the Storage, a portion of the processing liquor carried by the fabric rope drips on the essentially vertical section of the Fabric rope path. This action is thereby supported that the fabric rope lies on the reel winder surface with its weight and therefore is more or less pressed together.<br>
In order to distribute the processing liquor as far as possible uniformly on the circulating fabric rope, the processing liquor is circulated through a Liquor Circulation Pump and in cooperation with current of the Transport Medium, brought on the fabric -rope for the desired effect. In one of the wet processing (or finishing) machines of this type, know from EP 0078022, the processing material is added in atomized form to a gas stream, which serves as the transport medium current for the circulating fabric rope. In respect of another piece dyeing machine, which works on the basis of the aerodynamic   principle,   according   to   EP   09455381,   the   processing   material   is<br><br><br>
introduced in the Jet housing of the Transport jet, whereby the particles of the processing material is distributed by the gaseous transport medium current through the Nozzle Annular Gap uniformly on the moving fabric rope, in which process, during the transport jet's subsequent movement through the intensive stretch, they are milled.<br>
Experience in actual practice has shown that the quantity of the liquid processing liquor, which can be sprayed in gaseous Transport Medium current, for a jet finishing machine, working on aerodynamic principle, is limited. The liquid droplets of the processing liquor brought to the Transport medium current should be accelerated in the fabric rope movement direction, for which purpose a significant Energy of the transport medium current is necessary, which must be generated through the Blower, helping this process. Particularly, during rinsing or Hushing of the fabric rope, it is desirable to have a higher liquid throughput through the Transport Jet or Nozzle in order to reduce or shorten the rinsing / flushing time and to achieve a good flushing effect.<br>
Therefore, the task of the Invention is to devise a method, which enables to improve application of the processing or finishing liquor on to the fabric rope, in a simple manner.<br>
For solving this problem, reference is made to the characteristics of the Patent Claim 1 for the invention-based Wet Processing machine.<br>
The new Wet processing machine is equipped with means for bringing the processing liquor on to the fabric rope on a section or segment of the fabric rope path between the area of the Reel winder and an Annular Gap of the Transport Jet system, which enables, in addition or alternatively to the existing means in the area of the Transport jet system for this purpose, to bring the processing liquor on the fabric rope to achieve the desired effect so that the fabric rope enters already loaded with the processing liquor in the area of the Nozzle Annular Gap of the Transport jet system. Because of the fact that the application of the processing liquor on the fabric rope takes place between the area of the reel winder and the nozzle annular gap, a specially effective wetting of the fabric rope before the processing of the fabric rope with the processing liquor in the Transport jet system is achieved. This is because generally the horizontal, or as against the<br><br>
horizontal slightly tilted path of the fabric rope, between the reel winder and the transport jet system, is relatively shod with the result that the fabric rope brings in a larger portion of the processing liquid into the transport jet system. Correspondingly, the portion of the processing liquor applied to the fabric rope in the area of the transport jet system itself can be reduced.<br>
It is purposeful, if the device of application of the processing liquor on the fabric rope are so arranged, that the processing liquor emanating from these possess at least an agitation component in the flow direction of the fabric rope. Therewith, the required energy for acceleration of the liquid droplets in the fabric rope direction is minimized, because the processing liquor applied is already accelerated in the movement direction of the fabric rope. This results in a relief to the gaseous transport medium circulation and a faster fabric rope rotation. Furthermore, the product passing through is improved, which is attributable to the fact that the liquid droplets of the processing liquor no longer impact from the right-angle on the fabric rope to the fabric rope run direction.<br>
In actual design, the processing liquor application device, in the area of the reel winder, can have a spraying device with a spraying nozzle. This spray nozzle has, in the area of its nozzle mouth an axis, which locks in or encompasses the fabric rope run direction with an angle less than 90°.<br>
Simpler design features can be achieved if the reel winder device has at least one winder, pivoting on a rotation axis, and the processing liquor application device for instance, open out in an area upper half of the winder, so that the exiting processing liquor flows downwards and impacts on the fabric rope moving by. Alternatively and/or additionally, the processing liquor application device can also open out in an area lying between the axis of the winder and a nozzle cone or taper of the Transport jet system, if this is possible in the context of the design practices.<br>
The new wet processing machine can also have additionally or alternatively, devices for injection of a processing liquor in the passage channel of the nozzle cones, which open out to the channel wall, limiting the passage channel all around. Through this injection<br><br>
device, the processing liquor, that means, the processing substance is brought on to the fabric rope passing through the transport nozzle separately from the Transport medium current. Also here, the impacting of the fabric rope with the processing liquor is independent of the speed of the Transport medium current flowing in the annular gap, which brings about the conveyance/transport of the product. Because of the fact that the injection device is arranged in the area oi'the nozzle cone, the fabric rope is already pre-treated with the processing liquor emanating from the injection device, if the fabric rope enters the annular gap and there it is impacted with the transport medium. As the injection device is distributed around the passage channel wall, the fabric rope passes through a processing liquor curtain, during movement through the passage channel of the nozzle cones. Because of this, a very soft impacting of the product with the processing liquor takes place, which is arranged concentrically around the nozzle opening.<br>
As already mentioned, in a preferred design form, the injection device converge with reference to the longitudinal central axis of the passage channel in such a manner, that the processing liquor flowing from it into the passage channel has an agitation component in the product flow direction. For this purpose, the injection devices are arranged so that they converge advantageously under an angle with the longitudinal central axis and its vertex pointing to the product flow direction. Through these measures, what is achieved is that the above referred to processing liquor curtain A, has a component directing to the product flow direction, which can be so enlarged, that it has nearly the speed of the passing fabric rope. As a consequence, the processing liquor, fed through the injection device into the passage channel, as mentioned, need not be accelerated initially by the through-moving fabric rope, which would have led to a braking effect on the product fabric rope. In a preferred design form, the injection device has injection channels distributed around the channel wall, and converging in the passage channel, whereby their converging throughout the circumference of the passage channel is ideally distributed uniformly. Alternatively or additionally, the injection device could have at least one annular gap penetrating and surrounding all around the wall of the passage channel, which encompasses the passing fabric rope and brings the processing liquor uniformly on the fabric rope. In either of the case however, a very soft impacting of the fabric rope takes place, as already mentioned. The required milling or<br><br>
massaging of the processing liquor in the product takes place through the transport medium current during passage of the fabric rope through the subsequent intensive path of the transport nozzle, which extends itself from the annular gap in the product flow direction. Through the injection of the processing liquor in the nozzle cone, it is not necessary for the processing liquor to be deflected', it lands directly and 100% on the through-going product stream, because no spilling or scattering of the liquid particles takes place; this could not have been avoided if the processing liquor was facing the transport medium current.<br>
It is possible to encircle the transport nozzle in the customary manner with its own nozzle housing in the area of the annular gap, which is connected through a corresponding line with the transport medium source. Especially in respect of the so-called multi-storage machines, in which several transport jets, side by side, are allotted to a single vessel, the arrangement can be made in such a manner that the transport nozzle of the jet system are located together with their annular gaps in a common transport medium distribution chamber, impinged to the gaseous transport medium. This distribution chamber can be designed purposefully as a longitudinal transport medium distribution box, connected to the transport medium source, in which the transport nozzles are directly placed.<br>
Further developments of the invention are the object of sub-claims. A design example of the object of the invention is illustrated in the drawing. It shows:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The High temperature (HT) - Piece dyeing machine, schematically illustrated in Figure 1, has a pressure-proof cylindrical vessel 1, in which there is an opening 3 for operational purposes, which is closeable with a lid 2, through which fabric rope 4 can be brought in. The fabric rope 4 is led through an externally driven Winder 5 in a Venturi-Transport jet 6, to which a Plaiter 7 is connected. The Plaiter 7 places the fabric rope 4 emerging from the Transport jet 6 plaited in a Storage 8. from which the endless fabric rope is pulled out through the Winder 5 again. Thereby, the fabric rope 4, as can be seen from Figure 1, follows a primarily vertical path between Storage 8 and the Winder 5. The Winder 5 and the Transport Jet 6 are placed in the Housing part 9, which has a leak-proof connection to the Vessel 1 • The Fabric rope 4 would be tied, after bringing it in through the Opening 3, to its ends in order to build an endless product Loop.<br>
The Transport jet 6 is impinged with a gaseous Transport medium current, which places the passing fabric rope 4 in rotation movement, as illustrated through Arrow 10. The Transport medium in the above case is air or air- steam compound, which is sucked through a Blower 11 and a Suction Pipe 12 from the Vessel 1 and conveyed through a Discharge Pipe 13 in the Transport jet 6.<br><br>
In the Vessel 1, a Liquor Sump 14 is provided at the bottom, which includes a Liquor<br>
strainer 15 and which is connected to a suction pipe 16 of a Liquor Circulation Pump<br>
17, the discharge pipe 18 of which includes a heat exchanger 19, and through a<br>
regulation valve 20 and a Pipe 21, converges in the Transport jet 6. 1 he<br>
Liquor Circulation Pump 17 enables the processing / finishing liquor sucked<br>
from vessel-1 to be circulated through the Transport Jet 6 and Vessel 1. The<br>
Circulation path is indicated in Figure	1  (in black colour). Parallel to the Heat<br>
exchanger 19 and the Liquor Circulation Pump 17, lies a Bypass pipe 22, which includes a shut off valve 23, and joins the Sump 14 with the discharge pipe 21.<br>
Finally, a make-up material container 24 is also visualized, which contains in watery solution, emulsion or dispersion, a chemical processing material, which can be supplied through a processing material pump 25 and a linking pipe 26 to the suction pipe 16 of the Liquor circulation pump 17. As can be seen from Figure 2, the piece dyeing machine is designed as a multi-storage machine, which in the above mentioned case, consists of four Storages 8 placed one after the other in the axial direction of the cylindrical vessel 1. Each one of the Storage 8 is provided with a Transport Jet 6. The four Transport jets 6 represent a Transport Jet System. In this Jet system, each Transport jet 6, is allocated with a geared winder 5. as can be clearly seen in Figure 1, whose drive system individually is not illustrated. The Winder 5 with its drives and housing 9 makes for the wending device.<br>
The hitherto described piece dyeing machine working in accordance with the aerodynamic principle is per se known.<br>
In accordance with the invention, additional devices for this piece dyeing machine are planned in order to bring the processing liquor on the fabric rope 4 in the area of the wending device.<br>
For this purpose, the Winder 5, in the upstream of each of the transport jet 6 in the fabric rope flow direction, pivoting around a rotation axis 28 in housing 9, is allotted with a processing liquor nozzle 29 (Figure 3), which is positioned<br><br>
in a connecting sleeve 30 of the housing 9. The processing liquor nozzle 29, designed where applicable as spray nozzle or injection nozzle, through a pipe 3 1 (Figure-1) and a control valve 32 is connected with the processing liquor discharge pipe 21. As can be seen from Figure 2, in the above mentioned cades, the pipes 31 leading to the four transport jets 6 are connected in parallel to a collective pipe 33, which in turn is connected to the discharge pipe 21.<br>
Figure 3 shows that the processing liquor nozzle 29	in     the      area     of     its<br>
convergence from vertical direction is bent to align approximately with the fabric rope passage direction 10 in such a manner that the nozzle convergence axis 34, with the fabric rope transport direction 10, encloses a vertex, the angle point of which lies in front of the fabric rope direction. What is achieved thereby is that the processing liquor exiting from nozzle 29 has an agitation component in the movement direction 10 of the fabric rope 4.<br>
As denoted in Figure-3, the transport Jet 6 has a nozzle cone 35 with a coaxial passage channel 36 for the fabric rope 4, to which, in the fabric rope flow direction, a diffuser37 connects up, which creates, together with the nozzle cone 35 an annular gap 38. The annular gap 38 is positioned in a surrounding tuba-formed nozzle housing 39, in which the processing liquor discharge pipe 21 (not illustrated in Figure 3) and the blower- discharge pipe 13 converge.<br>
The convergence of the discharge pipe 21 for the processing liquor in the nozzle housing 39 takes place (a convergence not further illustrated in detail in Figure 3) such that it can be similarly aligned in the rotation direction 10 of the fabric rope 4, and from which the liquid droplets of the injected processing liquor from the transport medium current can be brought in the annular gap 38.<br>
Alternatively or additionally to the injection or discharge pipe 21 converging in the nozzle housing 39, the arrangement can also be such, as illustrated in Figure 3, that the injection channels 40 are provided in the nozzle cone 35, which distributed uniformly around the passage channel 36, converge in these. The injection channels 40 as can be seen from Figure 3, with their<br><br>
central axis counter to the product How direction 10 are arranged with a tilt in such a manner, that the processing liquor sprays emerging from them have an agitation component in the rope flow direction 10. Evidently, the axes of the injection channels 40 (of which only one is illustrated) encloses, with the axis of the passage channel 36, an angle smaller than 90°.<br>
The injection channels 40 branch from a ring channel 410, placed on the nozzle cone 35, which is connected through a pipe 21a with the discharge pipe 21        of the liquor circulation pump 17.<br>
In operation, the processing liquor circulated on the circulation path illustrated in black colour in Figure 1, to which where applicable, special processing additives from the make-up material container 24, for instance, dyes, are added, and which is brought up to the respectively required processing temperature in the heat exchanger, is injected through the discharge pipe 21 in the nozzle housing 39 of each of the transport jets and using the transport medium current, is brought on the passing fabric rope 4. Simultaneously, the processing liquor is brought on the fabric rope 4 through pipe 21 and the nozzle 29 in the area of the respective winder 5 before it runs into the nozzle cone 35. The splitting of the processing liquor between the nozzle housing 39 and the processing liquor nozzle 29 can be adjusted with both the regulating valves 22, 32 (Figure 1). As already mentioned, additionally or alternatively, processing liquor can be brought on the fabric rope also through the pipe 21 a of Figure 3 and through the injection channel 40.<br>
While in the described design model, processing liquor nozzle 29 converges upper half of the winder 5, the arrangement can also be such that the convergence of the processing liquor nozzle 29 happens in the area between the rotation axis 28 of the winder 5 and the fabric rope entry in the nozzle cone 35. This is possible through a pipe 31a, schematically denoted in dotted line in Figure 1, which includes a regulation valve bra. It is also possible to think of applying the processing liquor on the fabric rope before its entry in<br><br>
the nozzle cone 35 flatly distributed or at several places in the section between the rotation axis 28 and the nozzle cone 35.<br>
In the Figures 4 to 6 a further example of a wet processing machine according to the invention is explained in the form of a High Temperature (HT)- piece dyeing machine based on aerodynamic principle, of which in Figure 4 mainly the vessel 1 is illustrated, which is designed as a closed cylindrical pressure vessel. The machine is a so-called multi-storage machine and has again four Venturi-Transport jets 6. which are arranged in the vessel 1 in axial direction, one after the other. The Winder 5 provided for each of the transport jets 6 is in this context arranged in such a manner, that primarily a horizontal path of the fabric rope 4 emerges between the Winder 5 and the transport jet 6.<br>
Using the figures 1 to 3 identical components are marked with identical reference numbers and are not explained once more. Components, which are not significant for the invention, are not illustrated in the figures. For details, reference for instance, is also made to EP 0945 538 Al.<br>
The drive of the fabric rope 4 in the respective transport jet 9 happens through its<br>
being impinged with a gaseous transport medium', that is, generally Air,<br>
Steam or an Air-steam compound. For this purpose, the blower level is<br>
provided in the face or front side of the vessel, which is driven through an<br>
electrometer (la, and possesses a compressed air channel 13, which converges<br>
in a transport medium distribution box 41, extending over the axial length of<br>
the four Storages (3). The blower 11 is connected at the suction side with<br>
suction pipe 42, which is cc-axial to the cylindrical vessel 1, and which<br>
extends itself over the axial length of the vessel	1  and has on its wall a<br>
corresponding perforation.<br>
The transport medium - distribution box 41 is closed on one face side 150 and connected on its opposite face side to the compressed air channel 13 of<br><br>
the blower 11. It has a primarily rectangular structure (compare fig.2). Its upper roof wall 43 is designed, for matching with the curvature of the casing or shell of the vessel 1, in the form of a roof.<br>
In the Transport Medium Distribution Box 41, there are four Transport jets 6, which are assembled axis-parallel one after the other, as illustrated particularly in Fig 5, 6. Each transport jet 6 has a jet cone 35, which limits the cc-axial annular gap 38, using a portion of the co-axial diffuser 37, extended to yarn trap bra, through which the transport medium flows in a uniformly distributed manner in the diffuser 37. The nozzle cone 35 includes the coaxial passage channel 36 for the fabric rope 4, whereby the passage channel 36 is made of a cylindrical part 45 and a cc-axial part 46, which creates the entry for the fabric rope and extends itself in the form of a filter, to which the cylindrical part 45 is connected.<br>
As can be seen from Fig.5, the transport jets 6 in the Transport Medium<br>
Distribution Box 41 are placed with horizontally oriented nozzle longitudinal<br>
axis, in such a manner, that their nozzle cone 35 and their diffuser	37<br>
penetrate the opposite box side walls 46 respectively insulating each other.<br>
In operation, the space covered by the Transport-Medium-Distribution box 41, in which the annular gap 38 of the transport jet 6 are located, impinged by the blower 11 with transport medium, so that all four transport jets 6 convey their respective fabric rope 4 uniformly. The transport-medium-distribution box 41, with the transport jet 6 incorporated, works according to the so-called Common-Rail-principle and enables to guarantee a highly uniform flow of the transport medium to all the transport jets.<br>
As can be seen particularly from Figure 6, the nozzle cones 35 of each of the devices transport jet 6 are provided with devices for injection of a processing liquor in the passage channel 36, these devices, as denoted through arrow 240, are uniformly distributed around the wall of the passage channel 36 and converge all around the circumference. The injection devices have injection<br><br>
channels 40, which are provided in the nozzle cone 35 and converge in section 46 of the passage channel 36 expanding itself into a filter form. As already mentioned, the convergence of the injection channels 40 is, circumferentially, uniformly distributed over the passage' channel wall. Fig 6 shows that the injection channels with reference to the nozzle longitudinal central axis 47 is so inclined that their axes, with the longitudinal central axis 47 respectively, covers an angle, whose angle point shows the fabric rope movement direction 10. On the side opposite their convergence, the injection channels are connected with the inner space of the ring channel 410 attached to a nozzle cone 35 and surrounding it, which is connected to the pipe 21 a of the figure 3, which is not further illustrated.<br>
The processing liquor entering the passage channel of the nozzle cone 35 from<br>
the injection channels 40, at the time of its exit from the injection channels 40, is<br>
brought in intimate contact with the passing fabric rope 4. Because the injection<br>
channels 40 are arranged inclined against the nozzle longitudinal axis in the<br>
product flow direction, also here the processing liquor exiting from the injection<br>
channels possesses an agitation component in the product flow direction, and<br>
thus supports the fabric rope transport. The impinging of the ring channels 410<br>
with the processing liquor takes place under a pressure, which is so chosen, that<br>
the speed of the components of the processing liquor entering into the passage<br>
channel	36, indicating or pointing to the direction of the product flow 10.<br>
is somewhat similar to the flow speed of the product rope 4. Depending upon the respective process-related conditions, however, the speed of the agitation components could be however, even larger or smaller.<br>
Alternatively, the injection channels 40 can be substituted also through a surrounding annular gap, which remains connected to ring channel 410. Also design versions are conceivable, in which, several adjacent rows of injection channels 40 and/or several correspondingly placed annular gaps are provided, in the direction of the axis of the passage channels 36.<br>
Principally, there is also the possibility to arrange the injection channels or annular gaps<br><br>
in the cylindrical section 45 of the passage channel 36, about which reference is made here only for the sake of order.<br>
Also in this design form, similar as in the case of Figure 1, further devices for application of the processing liquor on the fabric rope can be visualized, which converge in the segment of the product flow path between the reel winder and the nozzle cone 35. Moreover, the reel winder 5 is incorporated directly in the area of the opening 2 in the vessel 1, as Figure 6 illustrates.<br>
In conclusion it may be mentioned that the invention is not restricted to application in respect of a wet processing machine, based on aerodynamic principle. It can also be used for jet-wet processing machines, which work with a liquid transport medium.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
