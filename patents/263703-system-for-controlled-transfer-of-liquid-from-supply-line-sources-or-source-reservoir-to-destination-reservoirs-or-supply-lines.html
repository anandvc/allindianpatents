				<td>4. Field of Invention<br>
The present invention is related to manual/automatic/scheduled/remote controlled transfer of liquid to destination reservoir or tank if continuous supply of liquid at source is available and/or manual/automatic/scheduled/remote controlled transfer of liquid from source to destination reservoir or tank. The destination reservoir may be an overhead tank or at a higher water level and the source reservoir or tank may be at the basement or at ground level or at a lower water level.<br>
Prior art: Many applications require availability of a liquid with pressure.   A<br>
common example is water distribution system to public consumers. The liquid<br>
source may not be able to distribute liquid at the required pressure head. This<br>
necessitates building of overhead liquid tanks or reservoirs for general public at<br>
a level much higher than that of source level. For filling these public overhead<br>
liquid reservoirs or tanks, motor pumps are used.  Also, these public overhead<br>
reservoirs or tanks do not ensure sufficient pressure head at consumer premises<br>
as different type of consumers are connected at different levels.   This further<br>
necessitates the consumers to build their own local overhead liquid tanks. The<br>
pressure head of liquid coming from public overhead reservoirs or tanks may<br>
not be sufficient to fill these local overhead liquid tanks.   This necessitates<br>
filling of local overhead liquid tanks with local motor pumps.   Further, the<br>
source may have continuous supply of liquid or may have intermittent supply of<br>
liquid. Sometimes, there are restrictions of placing the motor pump directly on<br>
the source supply line as it will reduce pressure head for those consumers who<br>
have not installed similar pumps.    Moreover, even if many of them have<br>
installed similar pumps on-line, only the consumer who is connected first with<br>
respect to source, his/her pump will suck the whole liquid and those connected<br>
down the line will get very less.  Thus, in those cases it is advisable to have a<br>
reservoir or tank at the level of source. The liquid is first filled in this source<br>
level tank and is then pumped to the local overhead reservoir or tank. Usually,<br>
it is difficult to know the status of liquid level in source or destination reservoir.<br>
Also,  transfer  of liquid  from  source  to  destination  reservoir  is  usually<br>
uncontrolled sometimes resulting into overflowing of destination reservoir. This<br>
results into wastage of precious liquid.    The motor pump should not be<br>
energized when there is no liquid in source reservoir or supply pipeline. This<br>
may sometimes damage the motor pump. Similarly, the motor pump should be<br>
de-energized when the  destination reservoir is  full.     Sometimes  due to<br>
insufficient withdrawal of liquid at destination points, the pressure in liquid<br>
pipeline increases beyond limit resulting into burst of pipeline.   In such cases<br>
the pressure in pipeline should be reduced by either de-energizing some of the<br>
motor pumps which are pumping liquid into the common pipeline or the pumps<br>
should be operated at reduced speed so that the pressure in pipeline may come<br>
within the prescribed limits.   Thus, there is a need of a controller cum status<br>
display system for transferring liquid from a continuous supply source to<br>
destination reservoir or tank, and/or for transferring liquid from source level<br>
reservoir or tank to destination	reservoir or tank.<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments:<br>
Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the particular arrangements shown since the invention is capable of other embodiments or change in the circuit. Also the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.<br>
The invention is divided into two parts viz., part 1 and part 2.<br>
The "Part 1" is used when continuous supply of liquid is available; whereas, the "Part 2" is used when either the motor pump is restricted to be connected to liquid supply line or the supply of liquid is intermittent or liquid from various sources is first collected in a source reservoir or tank and then transferred into destination tank.<br>
Part 1 System<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the "Part 1 system" consists of   mainly four units; viz.<br>
Controller and display unit (27), Top or elevated or destination reservoir (25), A.C.<br>
supply (26) and Motor Pump (28).    The Controller and display unit (27) is<br>
connected to AC voltage supply (26), Motor pump (28), Top or elevated or<br>
destination reservoir (25). The number of connections between Top or elevated or<br>
destination reservoir (25) and Controller and display unit (27) are three in the form<br>
of electrodes etc. going into the reservoir; but insulated from the body of the<br>
reservoir and connected to the liquid if it exists at that level as follows:<br>
I.   D.C. supply (Vcc) usually +5 V but not limited to this value connected to<br>
liquid at bottom of the reservoir. Vcc can be adjusted as per the type of liquid.<br>
II.   Liquid low level transducer (TL1) connected near the bottom of the reservoir,<br>
III.   Liquid top level transducer (TU1) connected at the top of the reservoir.<br>
Thus, depending upon the level of the liquid in reservoir(s), the corresponding transducer will sense or will be at Vcc potential. As shown in Fig. 2, the output of the transducers are going to 29a and 29b units in the Controller. Thus, the corresponding transistor(s) and the light emitting diode(s) will turn ON, whose input transducer is at Vcc potential. Thus, the corresponding light emitting diodes (D8, D9) will get lit indicating the level of liquid in destination reservoir. Besides, the above light emitting diodes, two more such light emitting diodes (D10 and Dl 1) exist at the Controller and display unit. The former indicating the availability of the power supply to the system and the latter indicating the status of power supply to motor pump. If D10 is lit, it indicates power supply is available to system and not otherwise. Similarly, if Dll is lit it indicates that motor pump is being powered and not otherwise. Switch S3 gives a choice to the user of automatic or manual control of the system. Also, the manual operation can be opted for if the controller logic circuit is not working as per the requirement of the user. Once the manual operation is chosen, switch S4 helps in deciding whether to power the motor pump or not.<br>
In this system positive logic is followed.   Initially, if there is no liquid in<br>
destination reservoir i.e. TL1 = TU1 = 0, the 0(33) output of S-R flip flop (32) will be at logic 0 which is connected at the base of transistor (35), thus turning it OFF. This is depicted by state "J" in Table 1. Transistor (35) when in OFF state will allow the capacitor across which it is connected to charge. Therefore, firing pulses will be given by UJT (36) and therefore TRIAC (38) will be in ON state. Thus, motor pump (28) is energized and liquid start pouring into the destination reservoir (25). If the continuous supply is also used sometimes to supply liquid to some consumers through the opening of some valves, and if these valves remain open will not build sufficient pressure in the pipes to raise the liquid to destination reservoir level, then the (33) output of S-R flip flop (32) can be used to close those valves when the motor pump is energized and open the same valves automatically when the motor pump is de-energized. As the liquid level in reservoir (25) increases, it first rises to TL1 level. Thus, TL1 goes to logic 1; whereas, TU1 remains at logic 0. This depicts state "K" in Table 1. Thus, the Vcc voltage source connected at the bottom of the reservoir will get connected through the liquid to the electrode at level TL1. This will turn ON transistor 29b and light emitting diode (LED) D9. The user will came<br>
to know that the liquid is at level TL1 in the destination reservoir. The Q(33) output of S-R flip flop (32) will remain at logic 0 and is connected at the base of transistor (35), thus keeping it OFF. The motor pump will remain in operation. Thus, the motor pump remains ON in both states "J" and "K". When the tank or the reservoir (25) gets filled, i.e. the liquid level rises to TU1, both TL1 and TU1 are at logic 1. This is depicted by state "L" in the logic truth<br>
table 1. The 0(33) output of S-R flip flop (32) will be at logic 1 which is connected at the base of transistor (35), thus turning it ON. Transistor (35) when in ON state will not allow the capacitor across which it is connected to charge. Therefore, firing pulses will not be given by UJT (36) and therefore TRIAC (38) will be in OFF state. Thus, motor pump (28) is de-energized and liquid stops pouring into the destination reservoir (25). This stops automatically overflowing of destination reservoir and hence wastage of liquid. Thus, the motor pump stops only when the destination reservoir is full. Now, if the liquid level recedes in top or destination reservoir (25) such that its level is<br>
below TU1, the 0(33) output of S-R flip flop (32) will remain at logic 1 (QN-1,,<br>
state K) and is connected at the base of transistor (35), thus keeping it ON. Therefore, the TRIAC (38) will remain in OFF state. Thus, motor pump (28) remains de-energized. The motor pump will operate only when liquid level reduces to a level below TL1 (state J). The circuit design is such that it does not turn OFF or turn ON the motor pump frequently as the liquid level changes by one level only either in source reservoir or destination reservoir except in case of following extreme conditions:<br>
1.	If the liquid in destination reservoir is at or higher than the maximum level,<br>
2.	If the liquid in destination reservoir is below than the minimum level,<br>
Part 2 System<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the system consists of mainly five units; viz. Controller and display unit (20), Source or basement reservoir (2), Top or elevated or destination reservoir (1), A.C. supply (16) and Motor Pump (17). The Controller and display unit (20) is connected to AC voltage supply (16), Motor pump (17), Source or basement reservoir (2) and Top or elevated or destination reservoir (1). The number of connections between Top or elevated or destination reservoir (1) and Controller and display unit (20) are four in the form of electrodes etc. going into the reservoir; but insulated from the body of the reservoir and connected to the liquid if it exists at that level as follows:<br>
IV.   D.C. supply (Vcc) usually +5 V but not limited to this value connected to liquid at bottom of the reservoir. Vcc can be adjusted as per the type of liquid. V.   Liquid low level transducer connected near the bottom of the reservoir, VI.   Liquid medium level transducer connected at half the height of the reservoir, VII.   Liquid top level transducer connected at the top of the reservoir. The number of connections between  Source  or basement reservoir (2) and Controller and display unit (20) are three in the form of electrodes etc. going into the reservoir; but insulated from the body of the reservoir and connected to the liquid if it exists at that level as follows: I.   D.C. supply (Vcc) usually +5 V but not limited to this value connected to<br>
liquid at bottom of the reservoir, II.   Liquid low level transducer connected near the bottom of the reservoir, III.   Liquid medium level transducer connected at half the height of the reservoir,<br>
Thus, depending upon the level of the liquid in reservoir(s), the corresponding transducer will sense or will be at Vcc potential. As shown in Fig. 4, the output of the transducers are going to 3a, 3b, ... 3e units in the Controller. Thus, the corresponding transistor(s) and the light emitting diode(s) will turn ON, whose input transducer is at Vcc potential. Thus, the corresponding light emitting diodes (Dl, ...,D5) will get lit indicating the level of liquid in both source and destination reservoir(s) simultaneously and separately. Besides, the above light emitting diodes, two more such light emitting diodes (D6 and D7) exist at the Controller and display unit. The former indicating the availability of the power supply to the system and the latter indicating the status of power supply to motor pump. If D6 is lit, it indicates power supply is available to system and not otherwise. Similarly, if D7 is lit, it indicates that motor pump is being powered and not otherwise. Switch SI gives a choice to the user of automatic or manual control of the system. Also, the manual operation can be opted for if the controller logic circuit is not working as per the requirement of the user. Once the manual operation is chosen, switch S2 helps in deciding whether to power the motor pump or not.<br>
In this system positive logic is followed. Initially, if there is no liquid in source reservoir i.e. BL = BM = BU = 0, the output of S-R flip flop (24) will be logic 1 and the output of S-R flip flop (8) will not be able to reach the base of transistor<br>
(13)	as the tri-state switch (9) will be in high impedance state. At the same time, the tri-state switch (11) will be enabled and thus, Vcc i.e. logic 1 will get connected at the base of transistor (13), thus turning it ON. This is depicted by State "A" in Table 2. Transistor (13) when in ON state will not allow the capacitor across which it is connected to charge. Therefore, firing pulses will not be given by UJT<br>
(14)	and therefore TRIAC (15) will be in OFF state. Thus, power to motor pump (17) is inhibited and thus the pump will not operate. The motor pump will operate only when transistor (13) is in OFF state. Thus, if liquid is not there in source reservoir (BL = 0; state A), the motor pump will not operate. This prevents the motor pump from dry run. Now, if liquid starts poring in base or source reservoir, first the liquid will reach level BL. Thus, the Vcc voltage source connected at the bottom of base reservoir will get connected through the liquid to the electrode at level BL. This will turn ON transistor 3e and light emitting diode (LED) D5. The user will came to know that the liquid is at level BL in base or source reservoir. The output (Q) of S-R flip flop (24) will remain at last state i.e. logic 1 in this sequence of operation and therefore tri-state switch (11) will be enabled and thus Vcc will be connected at the base of transistor (13) and the motor pump will remain OFF irrespective of output Q of S-R flip-flop (8). This is depicted by first output state of state B in logic truth table. The second output state in state B will be active when the liquid is receding in source reservoir. Thus, if the supply of liquid to base reservoir is maintained, the liquid level will further increase and may reach BM. This is depicted by state C in the logic truth table. For this state, the output of S-R flip flop (24) will become logic 0 and thus the tri-state switch (9) will get enabled; whereas, the tri-state switch (11) will get disabled i.e. it will go in high impedance state. The Q output of S-R flip-flop (8) will become 0 and thus transistor (13) will turn OFF.  This will result in turning ON of the motor pump (17) if AC supply is<br>
connected. Thus, the liquid will be transferred from base or source reservoir to the destination reservoir. This is depicted by state C in the Table 2. If the supply of source reservoir is also used sometimes to supply liquid to some consumers through the opening of some valves, and if these valves remain open will not build sufficient pressure in the pipes to raise the liquid to destination reservoir level, then<br>
the Q output of S-R flip flop (8) can be used to close those valves when the motor pump is energized and open the same valves automatically when the motor pump is de-energized. The liquid level in destination reservoir will increase and will reach level TL. By same analysis it can be shown that motor pump (17) will remain ON and this is depicted by state D in Table 2. If the liquid level in destination reservoir is increasing, it will reach TM level. As given in Table 2, the circuit will<br>
be in state E and the output Q of S-R flip-flop (8) will be last state i.e. logic 0 and motor pump will remain ON as per this sequence and the liquid will further increase to level TU. Now, the circuit has reached state F as depicted in Table 2<br>
and the output Q of S-R flip flop (8) will become 1, thus stopping the motor pump from operation. This is depicted by state F of the circuit. Now, either the circuit will remain in state F or may go into one of the following states:<br>
•	State E,<br>
•	State G,<br>
•	State H<br>
If the circuit remains in state F, the output Q of S-R flip-flop (8) will remain 1 and therefore motor pump will remain OFF. However, if the circuit changes to any of the states E, G or H, the output Q of S-R flip-flop (8) will remain last state i.e. 1 and therefore motor pump will remain OFF. Analyzing physically states E, G and H, it can be concluded that in state E, the liquid level is just decreasing by one level i.e. from level TU in destination reservoir. In state G, the liquid level in source reservoir is just decreasing by one level i.e. from level BM; whereas, in state H, the liquid level in both source and destination reservoir(s) are decreasing by one level from their levels in state F. The output<br>
Q of S-R flip flop (8) in all the three states E, G and H is last state i.e. logic 1; i.e. motor pump will remain OFF. Thus, if the liquid changes by one level it will not change the state of the motor pump.<br>
Also, analysis of state sequence D-E-F or D-E-G can be done as follows. In state D, the motor pump is ON. In state E it is in last state i.e. again ON and in state F or G it is OFF. While the system changes from state D to E there is change of only one level in destination reservoir, so there is no change in state of motor pump. Whereas, as system changes from state E to F or to G, the state<br>
of output Q of S-R flip flop (8) changes to 1; i.e. motor pump should turn OFF as level in destination reservoir has risen to TU. This stops automatically overflowing of destination reservoir and hence wastage of liquid. The circuit design is such that it does not turn OFF or turn ON the motor pump frequently as the liquid level changes by one level only either in source reservoir or destination reservoir except in case of following extreme conditions:<br>
1.	If the liquid in destination reservoir is at or higher than the maximum level,<br>
2.	If the liquid in source reservoir is below minimum level.<br>
Enhanced System<br>
As shown in Fig 3, the system consists of mainly five units; viz. Controller and display unit (20), Source or basement reservoir (2), Top or elevated or destination reservoir (I), A.C. supply (16) and Motor Pump (17). The Controller and display unit (20) is connected to AC voltage supply (16), Motor pump (17), Source or basement reservoir (2) and Top or elevated or destination reservoir (1). The number of connections between Top or elevated or destination reservoir (1) and Controller and display unit (20) are four in the form of electrodes etc. going into the reservoir; but insulated from the body of the reservoir and connected to the liquid if it exists at that level as follows:<br>
IV.   D.C. supply (Vcc) usually +5 V but not limited to this value connected to liquid at<br>
bottom of the reservoir. Vcc. can be adjusted as per the type of liquid. V.   Liquid low level sensor connected near the bottom of the reservoir,<br>
VI.   Liquid medium level sensor connected at half the height of the reservoir, VII.   Liquid lop level sensor connected at the top of the reservoir. The number of connections between Source or basement reservoir (2) and Controller and display unit (20) are three in the form of electrodes etc, going into the reservoir; but<br>
insulated from the body of the reservoir and connected to the liquid if it exists at that level as follows:<br>
I.   D.C. supply (Vcc) usually +5 V but not limited to this value connected to liquid at<br>
bottom of the reservoir,<br>
II.   Liquid low level sensor connected near the bottom of the reservoir, III.   Liquid medium level sensor connected at half the height of the reservoir,<br>
Thus, depending upon the level of the liquid in reservoir(s), the corresponding sensor will sense or will be at Vcc potential. As shown in Fig. 4, the output of the sensors are going to 3a, 3b, .. 3e units in the Controller. Thus, the corresponding transistor(s) and the light emitting diode(s) will turn ON, whose input sensor is at Vcc potential. Thus, the corresponding light emitting diodes (Dl, ...,D5) will get lit indicating the level of liquid in both source and destination reservoir(s) simultaneously and separately. Besides, the above light emitting diodes, two more such light emitting diodes (D6 and D7) exist at the Controller and display unit. The former indicating the availability of the power supply to the system and the latter indicating the status of power supply to motor pump. If D6 is lit, it indicates power supply is available to system and not otherwise. Similarly, if D7 is lit, it indicates that motor pump is being powered and not otherwise. Switch SI gives a choice to the user of automatic or manual control of the system. Also, the manual operation can be opted for if the controller logic circuit is not working as per the requirement of the user. Once the manual operation is chosen, switch S2 helps in deciding whether to power the motor pump or not. In this system positive logic is followed. Initially, if there is no liquid in source reservoir i.e. Bl = BM = BU = 0, the output of S-R flip flop (24) will be logic 1 and the output of S-R flip flop (8) will not be able to reach the base of transistor (13) as the tri-state switch (9) will be in high impedance state. At the same time, the tri-state switch (11) will be enabled and thus, Vcc i.e. logic 1 will get connected at the base of transistor (13), thus turning it ON. This is depicted by State "A" in Table 2. Transistor (13) when in ON state will not allow the capacitor across which it is connected to charge. Therefore, firing pulses will not be given by UJT (14) and therefore TR1AC (15) will be in OFF state. Thus, power to motor pump (17) is inhibited and thus the pump will not operate. The motor pump will operate only when transistor (13) is in OFF state. Thus, if liquid is not there in source reservoir (BL = 0; state A), the motor pump will not operate. This prevents the motor pump from dry run. Now, if liquid starts poring in base or source reservoir, first the liquid will reach level BL. Thus, the Vcc voltage source connected at the bottom of base reservoir will get connected through the liquid to the electrode at level BL. This will turn ON transistor 3e and light emitting diode (LED) D5. The user will came to know that the liquid is at level BL in base or source reservoir. The output (Q) of S-R flip flop (24) will remain at last state i.e. logic 1 in this sequence of operation and therefore tri-state switch (11) will be enabled and thus Vcc will be connected at the base of transistor (13) and the motor pump wilt remain<br>
OFF irrespective of output Q of S-R flip-flop (8). This is depicted by first output state of state B in logic truth table. The second output state in state B will be active when the liquid is receding in source reservoir. Thus, if the supply of liquid to base reservoir is maintained, the liquid level will further increase and may reach BM. This is depicted by state C in the logic truth table. For this state, the output of S-R flip flop (24) will become logic 0 and thus the tri-state switch (9) will get enabled; whereas, the tri-state<br>
switch (11) will get disabled i.e. it will go in high impedance state. The Q output of S-R flip-flop (8) will become 0 and thus transistor (13) will turn OFF. This will result in turning ON of the motor pump (17) if AC supply is connected. Thus, the liquid will be transferred from base or source reservoir to the destination reservoir. This is depicted by state C in the Table 2. If the supply of source reservoir is also used sometimes to supply liquid to some consumers through the opening of some valves, and if these  valves remain open will not build sufficient pressure in the pipes to raise the liquid to <br>
destination reservoir level, then the Q output of S-R flip flop (8) can be used to close<br>
those valves when the motor pump is energized and open the same valves automatically when the motor pump is de-energized. The liquid level in destination reservoir will increase and will reach level TL. By same analysis it can be shown that motor pump (17) will remain ON and this is depicted by state D in Table 2. If the liquid level in destination reservoir is increasing, it will reach TM level. As given in<br>
Table 2, the circuit will be in state E and the output Q of S-R flip-flop (8) will be last state i.e. logic 0 and motor pump will remain ON as per this sequence and the liquid will further increase to level TIL Now, the circuit has reached state F as depicted in<br>
i Table 2 and the output Q of S-R flip flop (8) will become 1, thus stopping the motor j pump from operation. This is depicted by state F of the circuit. Now, either the circuit will remain in state F or may go into one of the following states:<br>
•	State K,<br>
•	State G,<br>
•	State H<br>
If the circuit remains in state F, the output Q of S-R flip-flop (8) will remain \ and therefore motor pump will remain OFF. However, if the circuit changes to any of the states E, G or H, the output Q of S-R flip-flop (8) will remain last state i.e. 1<br>
and therefore motor pump will remain OFF. Analyzing physically states E, G and H, it can be concluded that in state E, the liquid level is just decreasing by one level i.e. from level TU in destination reservoir. In state G, the liquid level in source reservoir is just decreasing by one level i.e. from level BM; whereas, in state H, the liquid level in both source and destination reservoir(s) are decreasing by one level<br>
from their levels in state F. The output Q of S-R flip flop (8) in all the three states E, G and H is last state i.e. logic 1; i.e. motor pump will remain OFF. Thus, if the liquid changes by one level it will not change the state of the motor pump. Also, analysis of state sequence D-E-F or D-E-G can be done as follows. In state D, the motor pump is ON. In state E it is in last state i.e. again ON and in state F or G it is OFF. While the system changes from state D to E there is change of only one level in destination reservoir, so there is no change in state of motor pump.<br>
Whereas, as system changes from state E to F or to G, the state of output Q of S-R flip flop (8) changes to 1; i.e. motor pump should turn OFF as level in destination reservoir has risen to TU. This stops automatically overflowing of destination reservoir and hence wastage of liquid. The circuit design is such that it does not turn OFF or turn ON the motor pump frequently as the liquid level changes by one level only either in source reservoir or destination reservoir except in case of following extreme conditions:<br>
1.	If the liquid in destination reservoir is at or higher than the maximum<br>
level.<br>
