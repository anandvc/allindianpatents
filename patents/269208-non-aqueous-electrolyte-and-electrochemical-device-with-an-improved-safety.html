				<td>NON-AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTE AND ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE WITH<br>
AN IMPROVED SAFETY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte having improved safety and to an<br>
electrochemical device comprising the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, as electronic instruments have become<br>
wireless and portable, non-aqueous electrolyte-based<br>
secondary batteries with high capacity and high energy<br>
density have been practically used as drive sources for<br>
the electronic instruments. A lithium secondary battery,<br>
which is a typical example of the non-aqueous secondary<br>
batteries, comprises a cathode, an anode and an<br>
electrolyte and is chargeable and dischargeable because<br>
lithium ions coming out from a cathode active material<br>
during a charge process are intercalated into an anode<br>
active material and deintercalated during a discharge<br>
process, so that the lithium ions run between both the<br>
electrodes while serving to transfer energy. Such a<br>
high-capacity lithium secondary battery has an advantage<br>
in that it can be used for a long period of time due to<br>
high energy density. However, the lithium secondary<br>
battery has problems in that when the battery is exposed<br>
to high temperatures for a long period of time due to<br>
internal heat generation during the driving thereof, the<br>
stable structure of the battery, comprising a<br>
cathode(ex. lithium transition metal oxide), an anode<br>
(ex. crystalline or non-crystalline carbon) and a<br>
separator, will be changed due to gas generation caused<br>
by the oxidation of the electrolyte to deteriorate the<br>
performance of the battery or, in severe cases, to cause<br>
the ignition and explosion of the battery due to<br><br>
internal short circuits in severe cases.<br>
To solve such problems, there have been many<br>
recent attempts to improve the high-temperature safety<br>
of the battery by (1) using a porous polyolefin-based<br>
separator having a high melting point, which does not<br>
easily melt in the internal/external thermal<br>
environments or (2) adding a non-flammable organic<br>
solvent to a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising a<br>
lithium salt and a flammable organic solvent.<br>
However, the polyolefin-based separator has a<br>
disadvantage in that it should generally have high film<br>
thickness in order to achieve high-melting point and to<br>
prevent internal short circuits. This high film<br>
thickness relatively reduces the loading amount of the<br>
cathode and the anode, thus making it impossible to<br>
realize a high capacity of the battery, or deteriorating<br>
the performance of the battery in severe cases. Also,<br>
the polyolefin-based separator consists of a polymer<br>
such as PE or PP, which has a melting point of about<br>
150 oC, and thus, when the battery is exposed to high<br>
temperatures above 150 Â°C for a long period of time, the<br>
separator will melt, causing short circuits inside the<br>
battery, thus causing the ignition and explosion of the<br>
battery.<br>
Meanwhile, a lithium secondary battery comprising<br>
a flammable non-aqueous electrolyte containing a lithium<br>
salt, cyclic carbonate and linear carbonate has the<br>
following problems at high temperatures: (1) a large<br>
amount of heat is generated due to the reaction between<br>
lithium transition metal oxide and the carbonate solvent<br>
to cause the short circuit and ignition of the battery,<br>
and (2) a thermally stable battery cannot be realized<br>
due to the flammability of the non-aqueous electrolyte<br>
itself.<br>
Recently, efforts to solve the problems associated<br><br>
with the flammability of the electrolyte by adding a<br>
phosphorus (P)-based compound having flame retardancy<br>
have been made, but the compound causes a problem of<br>
accelerating irreversible reactions, including Li<br>
corrosion, in a battery, thus significantly reducing the<br>
performance and efficiency of the battery.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have found that when both a<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) compound and an aliphatic<br>
mono-nitrile compound are used as electrolyte additive,<br>
these compounds show a synergic effect in terms of the<br>
performance of a battery, as well as in terms of the<br>
safety of the battery, for example in terms of the<br>
prevention of battery ignition at over-charged state<br>
and/or the prevention of ignition/explosion caused by<br>
internal short circuit of a battery at high temperatures<br>
above 150 oC. The present invention is based on this<br>
finding.<br>
The present invention provides a non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte comprising a lithium salt and a solvent, the<br>
electrolyte containing, based on the weight of the<br>
electrolyte, 1-10 wt% of a compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product, and 1-40 wt% of an aliphatic<br>
mono-nitrile compound, as well as an electrochemical<br>
device comprising the non-aqueous electrolyte:<br>
[Formula 1]<br><br>
wherein X and Y are each independently hydrogen,<br>
chlorine or fluorine, except that both X and Y are not<br>
hydrogen.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
an electrochemical device comprising: a cathode having a<br><br>
complex formed between a surface of a cathode active<br>
material and an aliphatic mono-nitrile compound; and a<br>
non-aqueous electrolyte containing 1-10 wt% of a<br>
compound of Formula 1 or its decomposition product based<br>
on the weight of the electrolyte.<br>
In the present invention, the aliphatic mono-<br>
nitrile compound is preferably butyronitrile or<br>
valeronitrile.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the<br>
decomposition product of the compound of Formula 1 has<br>
an opened-ring structure.<br>

which the batteries are charged to 4.2V. Herein, FIG. 2<br>
is for Example 1, FIG. 3 for Comparative Example 1, FIG.<br>

FIG. 5 is a graphic diagram showing the results of<br>
heat generation analysis conducted using differential<br>

Examples 1, 4 and 5 and Comparative Example 5.<br>
Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in detail.<br>
The present inventors have found through<br>
experiments that the compound of Formula 1 and a nitrile<br><br>
compound having a cyano (-CN) functional group show a<br>
synergic effect in terras of securing battery safety<br>
associated with thermal shock and in terms of high-<br>
temperature cycle life (see FIGS. 1 to 4).<br>
When the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product and the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound are used in combination as additive, they can<br>
show a synergic effect in terms of the safety of a<br>
battery, and the mechanism thereof is as follows.<br>
The ignition and explosion reactions of a lithium<br>
ion battery can occur due to a rapid exothermic reaction<br>
between a charged cathode and an electrolyte, and if the<br>
capacity of the battery increases, only controlling the<br>
exothermic reaction between the cathode and the<br>
electrolyte cannot secure the safety of the battery.<br>
Generally, when the charge voltage of the cathode<br>
is high or the capacity of the battery is increased (an<br>
increase in the number of stacks (pouch type batteries,<br>
etc.) or the number of electrode windings of jelly-rolls<br>
(cylindrical or prismatic batteries, etc.)), the energy<br>
level of the battery will be increased, and thus the<br>
battery will tend to generate heat due to physical shock<br>
(e.g., heat, temperature, pressure, etc.), or in severe<br>
cases, explode, thus reducing the safety of the battery.<br>
The compound of Formula 1 such as a fluoroethylene<br>
carbonate can prevent or delay the battery from being<br>
ignited by the exothermic reaction, compared to ethylene<br>
carbonate. This is because the compound of Formula 1<br>
consists of a halogen-based compound (e.g., one<br>
introduced with at least one of fluorine (F) and<br>
chlorine (C1)) having a high flame-retardant effect, and<br>
in particular, the compound can form an SEI layer<br>
(protective layer) on the anode surface upon charge to<br>
delay micro- or macro-thermal short circuits occurring<br>
inside the battery.<br><br>
However, the compound of Formula 1 such as a<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate is so thermally fragile to be<br>
easily decomposed at high temperature and to generate a<br>
large amount of gas. The generated gas can vent a pouch-<br>
typed or can-typed battery case, thereby accelerating<br>
the combustion of the electrolyte and causing internal<br>
short circuits, particularly due to the exothermic<br>
reaction between the electrolyte and the oxygen<br>
introduced from the vented region, resulting in the<br>
ignition and explosion of the battery.<br>
That is, when the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product is used alone, the safety of the<br>
battery, particularly the high-temperature safety of the<br>
battery, cannot be sufficiently secured (see FIG. 3) .<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is characterized in<br>
that the aliphatic mono-nitrile compound is used in<br>
combination with the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product.<br>
When the aliphatic mono-nitrile compound is used<br>
in combination with the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product, the - aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound can form a complex on the surface of a cathode<br>
consisting of lithium-transition metal oxide so as to<br>
inhibit the reaction between the electrolyte (ex. linear<br>
carbonates or cyclic carbonates) and the cathode, thus<br>
controlling heat generation and controlling an increase<br>
in the temperature of the battery. Also, the complex<br>
formation can prevent the combustion of the electrolyte,<br>
which is accelerated by oxygen liberated due to the<br>
structural collapse of the cathode, prevent thermal<br>
runaway phenomena, and prevent the internal short<br>
circuit of the battery from occurring due to heat<br>
generation (see FIG. 5).<br>
Also, the continuous interaction chemically<br>
between the compound of Formula 1 and the cyano (-CN)<br><br>
functional group of the nitrile compound prevents a<br>
large amount of gas generation occurred when using the<br>
compound of Formula 1 alone.<br>
In short, 1) the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product and 2) an aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound such as butyronitrile or valeronitrile can show<br>
a synergic effect, thus improving the safety of the<br>
battery.<br>
Furthermore, when the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product and the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound are used in combination, they can show a<br>
synergic effect in terms of the performance of a<br>
battery, and the mechanism thereof is as follows.<br>
The compound of Formula 1 or its decomposition<br>
product forms a dense and close passivation layer on the<br>
anode upon the initial charge cycle (which is generally<br>
referred as formation of a battery). The passivation<br>
layer prevents co-intercalation of the carbonate solvent<br>
into the layered structure of active materials and<br>
decomposition of the carbonate solvent, and thus reduces<br>
irreversible reactions in the battery. Additionally, the<br>
passivation layer allows only Li+ to be<br>
intercalated/deintercalated through the layer, thereby<br>
improving the life characteristics of the battery.<br>
However, the passivation layer (SEI layer) formed<br>
by the compound is easily decomposed at high temperature<br>
(above 60 oC) to generate a large amount of gas (CO2 and<br>
CO) , and particularly in the case of a cylindrical<br>
battery, the generated gas breaks a current interruptive<br>
device (CID), an electrochemical device at a cylindrical<br>
cap region, to interrupt electric current, thus reducing<br>
the function of the battery. In severe cases, the<br>
generated gas opens the cap region, so that the<br>
electrolyte leaks to corrode the appearance of the<br>
battery or to cause a significant reduction in the<br><br>
performance of the battery.<br>
According to the present invention, gas generation<br>
resulting from the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product can be inhibited through the use<br>
of the aliphatic mono-nitrile compound by the chemical<br>
interaction between the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition and a cyano (-CN) functional group, thus<br>
improving the high-temperature cycle life<br>
characteristics of the battery(see Fig. 1).<br>
When considering this effect together with an<br>
improvement in the performance of a high-capacity<br>
battery, butyronitrile or valeronitrile is most suitable<br>
as aliphatic mono-nitrile.<br>
Among aliphatic mono-nitrile compounds, those<br>
having long chain length have no great effect on the<br>
performance and safety of the battery or adversely<br>
affect the performance of the battery, and thus those<br>
having short chain length are preferable. However,<br>
acetonitrile having an excessively short chain length<br>
causes side reactions in the battery, and thus it is<br>
preferable to use propionitrile (Formula 3) ,<br>
butyronnitrile (Formula 4), or valeronitrile (Formula<br>
5) . Among them, it is more preferable to select<br>
butyronnitrile or valeronitrile. Most preferred is<br>
butyronnitrile.<br>
[Formula 3]<br><br><br>
Meanwhile, among compounds containing a cyano<br>
functional group, aromatic nitriles and fluorinated<br>
aromatic nitrile compounds are not preferable because<br>
they are electrochemically easily decomposed in the<br>
battery to interfere with the migration of Li ions, thus<br>
deteriorating the performance of the battery.<br>
The content of the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product for use in the inventive<br>
electrolyte is preferably 1-10 wt%, and more preferably<br>
1-5 wt%, and most preferably 1-3 wt%. The compound of<br>
Formula 1 has a high viscosity, and thus when the<br>
compound of Formula 1 is used in an excessive amount,<br>
the ion conductivity of the electrolyte can be reduced<br>
and the mobility of Li ion can be inhibited, causing to<br>
a reduction of the cycle life and capacity of battery.<br>
The aliphatic mono-nitrile compounds, particularly<br>
butyronitrile and valeronitrile, have the effects of<br>
increasing the ion conductivity of the electrolyte and<br>
reducing the viscosity of the electrolyte, and for this<br>
reason, the content of the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound in the electrolyte is preferably 1-40 wt%, more<br>
preferably 1-20 wt%, and most preferably 1-10 wt%.<br>
The inventive electrolyte may contain as an<br>
additive an aliphatic di-nitrile compound having two<br>
cyano (-CN) functional groups such as CN-R-CN, wherein R<br>
is aliphatic hydrocarbon etc.), preferably<br>
succinonitrile. The content of the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound, particularly succinonitrile is preferably 1-10<br>
wt%, more preferably 1-5 wt%, and most preferably 1-3<br>
wt%.<br>
The inventive non-aqueous electrolyte for lithium<br>
secondary batteries contain a general non-aqueous<br>
organic solvents, including cyclic carbonates, linear<br>
carbonates and combinations thereof. Typical examples of<br>
the cyclic carbonates include ethylene carbonate (EC),<br><br>
propylene carbonate (PC), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and<br>
the like, and typical examples of the linear carbonates<br>
include diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate<br>
(DMC) , ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) and the like.<br>
The non-aqueous electrolyte contains a lithium<br>
salt, non-limiting examples of which include LiC104,<br>
LiCF3SO3, LiPF6, LiBF4, LiAsF6, LiSbF6, LiN (CF3SO2)2,<br>
LiN(C2F5SO2)2, LiAlO4, LiAlC14, LiSO3CF3, and<br>
LiN (CxF2x+1SO2) (CyF2y+1SO2) (x and y = natural numbers).<br>
Meanwhile, the aliphatic mono-nitrile compounds<br>
can form a bond with a transition metal, such as cobalt,<br>
contained in the cathode active material through their<br>
cyano functional groups having high dipole moment.<br>
Particularly, the cyano functional groups can form<br>
stronger bonds with the surface of the cathode at high<br>
temperature, thereby forming a complex structure.<br>
In order to simplify a manufacturing process of a<br>
battery, it is preferable that the aliphatic mono-<br>
nitrile compound is introduced into an electrolyte, and<br>
then a complex is formed between the surface of a<br>
cathode active material and the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound. However, it is also possible to separately<br>
prepare a cathode having a complex formed on the surface<br>
thereof, before the assemblage of a battery.<br>
Preferably, the complex between the surface of a<br>
cathode active material and the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound is formed by dipping a cathode, comprising a<br>
cathode active material coated on a collector, into an<br>
electrolyte containing the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound added thereto, followed by heat treatment at<br>
high temperature. The high-temperature heat treatment<br>
may be performed in such a temperature range as not to<br>
affect electrode active materials and a binder,<br>
generally at a temperature of 180 Â°C or lower.<br>
Otherwise, although the high-temperature heat treatment<br><br>
depends on the kind of the aliphatic mono-nitrile<br>
compound, it may be performed at such a temperature<br>
range as to prevent excessive evaporation of the<br>
aliphatic mono-nitrile compound, generally at a<br>
temperature of 100 Â°C or lower. In general, the high-<br>
temperature treatment is suitably performed at a<br>
temperature between 60 Â°C and 90 oC. Long-term treatment<br>
at a temperature between 30 oC and 40 Â°C may provide the<br>
same effect.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, a compound<br>
capable of forming a passivation layer on the surface of<br>
an anode may additionally be used to prevent side<br>
reactions where a passivation layer formed on the anode<br>
from the compound of Formula 1, such as fluoroethylene<br>
carbonate, emits a large amount of gas at high<br>
temperature. Non-limiting examples of the compound<br>
include alkylene compounds, such as vinylene carbonate<br>
(VC) , sulfur-containing compounds, such as propane<br>
sulfone, ethylene sulfite and 1, 3-propane sultone, and<br>
lactam-based compounds, such as N-acetyl lactam.<br>
Furthermore, the electrolyte according to the<br>
present invention may comprise vinylene carbonate,<br>
propane sulfone and ethylene sulfite at the same time,<br>
but only a sulfur-containing compound may also be<br>
selectively added to the electrolyte to improve the<br>
high-temperature cycle life characteristics of the<br>
battery.<br>
A typical example of electrochemical devices,<br>
which can be manufactured according to the present<br>
invention, is a lithium secondary battery, which may<br>
comprise: (1) a cathode capable of intercalating and<br>
deintercalating lithium ions; (2) an anode capable of<br>
intercalating and deintercalating lithium ions; (3) a<br>
porous separator; and (4) a) a lithium salt, and b) an<br>
electrolyte solvent.<br><br>
In general, as a cathode active material for use<br>
in a lithium secondary battery, lithium-containing<br>
transition metal oxides may be used. The cathode active<br>
material can be at least one material selected from the<br>
group consisting of LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4, LiMnO2, and<br>
LiNi1-xCoxMyO2 (wherein 0
metal such as Mg, Al, Sr or La). Meanwhile, as an anode<br>
active material for use a lithium secondary battery,<br>
carbon, lithium metal or lithium alloy may be used. In<br>
addition, other metal oxides capable of lithium<br>
intercalation/deintercalation and having an electric<br>
potential of less than 2V based on lithium (for example,<br>
TiO2 and SnO2) may be used as the anode active material.<br>
The lithium secondary battery according to the<br>
present invention may have a cylindrical, prismatic or<br>
pouch-like shape.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in further detail with reference to examples.<br>
It is to be understood, however, that these examples are<br>
illustrative only and the present invention is not<br>
limited thereto.<br>

solution having a composition of EC: EMC = 1: 2. To the<br>

wt % of butyronitrile were added. Artificial graphite<br>
and LiCoO2 were used as an anode active material and a<br>
cathode active material, respectively. Then, a 3562 size<br>

a conventional method and aluminum laminate was used as<br>
the battery package.<br>

fluoroethylene carbonate was added and butyronitrile was<br>
not added.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A lithium polymer batlery was manufactured in the<br>
same manner as in Example 1, except that 5 wt% of<br>
butyronitrile was added and fluoroethylene carbonate was<br>
not added.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A lithium polymer battery was manufactured in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative Example 2, except that 10<br>
wt% of butyronitrile was used instead of 5 wt% of<br>
butyronitrile.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A lithium polymer battery was manufactured in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative Example 3, except that<br>
valeronitrile was used instead of butyronitrile.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br><br>
A lithium polymer battery was manufactured in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative Example 1, except that<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate was not added.<br><experiment><br>
1.	Test for battery performance<br>
Each battery obtained from Examples 1 and 2 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 5 was stored at a high<br>
temperature of 80Â°C for 10 days and tested for battery<br>
performance. The test results are shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 comprising the non-aqueous electrolyte<br>
containing fluoroethylene carbonate and butyronitrile<br>
added thereto according to the present invention, showed<br>
excellent capacity restorability and battery performance<br>
even after a high-temperature storage.<br>
In the case of Comparative Example 1 comprising<br>
the non-aqueous electrolyte containing fluoroethylene<br>
carbonate added thereto without butyronitrile, a large<br>
amount of gas was generated during a high-temperature<br>
storage, thereby venting a battery case, causing to<br>
exposure of the electrolyte.<br>
2.	Test for Safety (1)<br>
Each of the batteries manufactured in Example 1<br>
and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 was charged to 4.25V<br>
and stored in an oven at 150 Â°C, and then whether the<br>
ignition and explosion of the batteries occurred was<br>
observed. The observation results are shown in FIGS. 2<br>
to 4.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 2, only the case of the<br>
battery containing 5 wt% of fluoroethylene carbonate<br>
(FEC) and 5 wt% of the butyronitrile compound added to<br>
the electrolyte solvent realized a thermally stable<br>
battery at high temperature for 1 hour or longer without<br>
ignition.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of adding<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate alone (FIG. 3) or the case of<br><br>
adding only butyronitrile or valeronitrile (FIG. 4), it<br>
could be seen that the battery was ignited and exploded<br>
at a high temperature above 150 oC.<br>
3. Test for Safety (2)<br>
Each of the batteries manufactured in Examples 1,<br>
4 and 5 and Comparative Example 5 was charged to 4.2V. A<br>
general thermogravimetric analyzer, DSC (Differential<br>
Scanning Calorimeter), was used, wherein two high-<br>
pressure pans capable of resisting the vapor pressure of<br>
the electrolyte were used as pans for measurement. To<br>
one pan, about 5-10 mg of the cathode sample separated<br>
from each of the batteries charged to 4.2V was<br>
introduced, while the other pan was left empty. The<br>
calorific difference between the two pans was analyzed<br>
while the pans were heated at a rate of 5 Â°C/min to<br>
400 Â°C to measure temperature peaks corresponding to heat<br>
generation.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the battery manufactured<br>
without the aliphatic mono-nitrile compound shows heat<br>
generation peaks at about 200 oC and about 240 oC.<br>
Generally, the peak at about 200 Â°C indicates heat<br>
generation caused by the reaction between the<br>
electrolyte and the cathode, while the peak at about<br>
240 Â°C indicates heat generation caused by combined<br>
factors including the reaction between the electrolyte<br>
and the cathode, and the structural collapse of the<br>
cathode. The battery comprising the non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte containing butyronitrile or valeronitrile<br>
added thereto showed a remarkable reduction in heat<br>
generation without showing the above two temperature<br>
peaks. This indicates that heat generation caused by the<br>
reaction between the electrolyte and the cathode was<br>
controlled due to the formation of a protective layer<br>
through a strong bond between butyronitrile or<br>
valeronitrile and the cathode surface.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, according to<br>
the present invention, when the compound of Formula 1<br>
and the aliphatic mono-nitrile compound are used in<br>
combination, they can show a synergic effect in terms of<br>
securing safety at a high temperature, and in terms of<br>
improving the battery performance by maintaining a high<br>
capacity and efficiency.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been described for illustrative purposes,<br>
those skilled in the art will appreciate that various<br>
modifications, additions and substitutions are possible,<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br><br>
