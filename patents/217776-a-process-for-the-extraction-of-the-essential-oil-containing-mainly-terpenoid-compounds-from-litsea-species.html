				<td>The invention relates to a process for the extraction  of the essential oil(s) from a Litsea species. citronell of and citral chanatype.<br>
More particularly it relates to an extraction of essential oil (s) in pure fonn from Litsea cubeba<br>
Per.s. Syn. L. Ciln.Ha Bl. Syn. L. Kingii Hook locally known in thc Norlhe-astcrn region oľ India as 'Mejankari'. It is pyramidal shaped handsome small deciduous tree , 5-8 m in height found in Eastern Himalayas up to an altitude of 2700 m. The plani is locatcd sporadically in many parts of Northeastern region of India specially Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya and Nagaland. In Assam it vvas once cxclusively uscd as hosl plant (br rcaring Muga silk worms on its leaves for production of a special kind of silk called 'Mejankari silk' . About 43 species are recorded in India of vvhich about 23 species including L . cubeba are native to Northeast India . L cbeba is a highly aromatic plant . Gencrally essential oils are obtaincd using stcam distillation, hydrodistillation or supercritical extraction of the different parts of aromatic plants, rhizomes etc. Almost all parts of Ihc plant v/r. Icaľ, slcin bark and fruit yicld volatilc oil on hydrodistillation. Fruit and stcin lark oil contains citral whilc ils Icaf oil contains cincolc as the major component. Aerial parts of the plants are subjected to hydrodistillation, using a Cleavenger apparatus, to produce an essential oil in 0.60 -5.50% (v/w, fresh weight basis) yield. The oil is analysed by gas chromatography/mas spectrometry (GC/MS). The components idcntified are cctronellol, neral, geranial, (citral a &amp; b) citronellal, geranyl acetate and few other minor constituents. As the oil is found to be a major source of many important tcrpenoid components, il is believed to have commcrcial potcntial for pcrfumcry and cosmctic induslry particularly may bc used in ilavours like apple, grape, orange, lime, strawberry and in perfumes for soap and in creating artificial citrus flavours. . The oil is coinparable to lemongrass oil, it contains citral (citral a and citral b) up to 92 % concencration of the total oil . It is clear from the above t hal no such oil from L. Cnbeba containing citronellal as major component has carlier been reported clsevvhcre. The source of the present process is infact, an additional chemotype (physiological form) of L. Cubeba vvhich has bccn discGvcrcd for tiic first time in contrast to previcus rcports GI cursi in<br>
Fruits and stem bark oils, cineole in leaf oil, the present finding indicated the fruit, stem bark, and leaf oils of L. Cubeba as citronellal, Citronellol and linallol types respectively. Excepting the type of hairs (trichomes) on leaves, the two types are found to be morphologically alike. In citral type, the trichomes are papillate and profusely distributed but restricted to lower surface only while in the additional citronellal type presently discovered, the trichomes are simple, pointed in lower and blunted in upper end but found in both the leaf surfaces and frequently distributed. These two types are also different in respect of Chemical constituents. The natural components present in the oil are preferred to synthetic ones for the reason that in perfumery industry olfactory assessment is a major criteria for perfumery Chemicals.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a simple economic environmentally friendly process for the extraction of a new essential oil obtained from Litsea cubeba Pers. Syn. L. citrate BI. Syn. L. kingii Hook a new source.<br>
The process according to the present invention consists of steps which are as follows :<br>
a)	Extraction of the plant material for isolation of the essential oil<br>
b)	Identification of pure individual components.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the extractiop of essential<br>
oil(s) containing mainly terpenoid components from Litsea species citronellol <br>
and citral chemetype  which comprises <br>
a)	hydrodistilling the plant Litsea sp. by known methods,<br>
b)	recovering the essential oil(s) using known separation techniques,<br>
c)	analyzing and identifying individual components by known methods.<br>
Litsea species used may be L cubeba, L. Odoriferous, L. Glutinosa, L. monopetala. The hydridistillation using steam may be carried out in the Cleavenger apparatus for 4-8 hour. An embodiment of the process is that the source material may be leaves, stem bark and fruits and the process may be effected in the similar method using steam. In an another embodiment of the<br>
process the fruits of the two chemotypes may be used for isolating the oil. In still another embodiment GC/MS analyses may be performed in the colnmns like fused silica, capillary glass or stainlcss slccl with inass selcclivc dctcclor (M S D) an helium as carrier gas .<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the invention which should not be construed to limit the scope of this invention. Example l Isolation of the Essential Oil<br>
Fresh leaves Litsea cubeba Pers.(1.0 kg) was cut into small pieces and taken in a 5 liter round bottom flask to which 2 liter of water was added and then heated over a 5 liter heating inantle where in a Cleavenger apparatus (Glass) was fitted in the ľlask. Aflcr l hr thc water vapour starled passing through the condenser and circulation of water oil mixture started. The oil was started separating on the top of the watcr. The heating is continucd for 4-6 hr. The amount of oil collected in the different experiments are tabulated in the following Table (Table l). Table l<br><br>

Example 5. GC/MS Analysis :<br>
GC/MS analysis were carried out with a mass spectrometer having mass selective detector (MSD), directly coupled to a gas chromatograph, a 25m X0.20 mm fused silica column, with a film thickness of 0.33 jam , was employed. The column oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 30 °C at 57 min. The injector and GC/MS interfaces temperatures were maintained at 280 and 300°C respectively. Samples were injccted by splittcr into helium carricr gas. which wns pressure conlrolled to givc a linear gas vclocity oľ 44 c/s (at 60"C). lilectron loni/ation mass specira were recordcci.
