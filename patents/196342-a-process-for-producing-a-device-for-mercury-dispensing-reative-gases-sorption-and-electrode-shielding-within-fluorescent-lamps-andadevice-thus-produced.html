The present invention refers to a process for producing a device for mercury dispensing, reactive gases sorption and electrode shielding within fluorescent lamps, and to the thus produced device.<br>
As it is known, the fluorescent lamps are formed of glass tubes (rectilinear or circular according to the type of lamp) the inner surface of which is lined with powders of fluorescent materials, called phosphors, which are the active elements for the emission of visible light. The tube is filled with a rare gas, generally argon or neon, including mercury vapors, in a quantity of some milligrams. Finally there are two electrodes, also called cathodes, being formed as metal wires placed at both ends of the tube in case of rectilineair lamps" or in .a given zone in the circular lamps. A potential difference is applied between the electrodes thus generating an electronic emission: as a consequence, a plasma of free electrons and ions of rare gas is formed which, by exciting the<br><br>
atoms of mercury, causes the emission of UV radiation from the latter ones. Generally the electrodes are shielded laterally by means of members made of metallic strip, placed co-axially to the lamp in order to avoid a phenomenon of phosphors blackening in the area of the electrodes, due to a direct electronic or ionic bombardment by the cathodes. The UV radiation emitted by the mercury atoms is absorbed by the phosphors which, through the fluorescence phenomenon, emit visible light. Therefore mercury is a necessary component for the lamps working. This element must be dosed in the lamps in the most precise and reproducible way. In fact mercury must be present in a minimum quantity, below which the lamp does not work, while it is advisable not to introduce batches with quantities of element which are too greater than the necessary minimum, since due to the toxicity of mercury this could bring to environmental problems in case of a breakage of the lamp or however at the life end thereof. The problem of mercury dosing has become complicated in the recent years as a consequence of the appearing on the market of an increasing variety of lamps which are different in shape, size and component materials, thus requiring<br><br>
to determine a method for the accurate and reproducible dosage of mercury quantities which may be very different from lamp to lamp.<br>
The conventional method of dosing the element in the liquid state is not reliable due to the difficulties of dosing exactly and in a reproducible way volumes of liquid mercury in the range of a few ^1 and to the problems involved as to the diffusion of mercury vapors in the working area. As an alternative various methods have been proposed: it is known the use of amalgams with elements such as zinc, which however show drawbacks during the step of assembling the lamps, since these amalgams tend to release mercury at the temperatures as low as about 100°C, while in the manufacturing of lamps working steps in which the lamp is still open at higher temperatures are encountered.<br>
Patents US-4.823.047 and US-4.754.193 suggest the use of capsules containing liquid mercury, but also in this case the dosage of the element is difficult and similarly difficult is the manufacturing of small size capsules. Patent US-4.808.136 and application EP-A-568317 disclose the use of pellets or pills of porous materials soaked<br><br>
with liquid mercury; in this case however the positioning of these pellets in the lamp may result troublesome.<br>
Patent US-3.657.589, in the name of the applicant, discloses the use of intermetallic compounds of mercury with titanium and/or zirconium for introducing and exactly dosing mercury in lamps: these materials are stable at temperatures of up to about 500°C, thus resulting compatible with all the usual steps of lamp manufacturing. Among these materials the preferred compound is TisHg, manufactured and sold by the applicant under the tradename St 505. According to said patent, the St 505 compound can be introduced into the lamp both in a free form, as compressed powders, and in a supported form, as powder being pressed in an open container or deposited on a supporting metallic strip. The last possibility is particularly appreciated by the manufacturers of lamps because the strip carrying the mercury dispensing material can be closed as a ring thus forming the electrode shielding member. After lamp closure (sealing), mercury is caused to be released from the compound through a so-called activation treatment, by heating the compound by means of RF<br><br>
waves produced by a coil external to the lamp during about 30 seconds at temperatures of about 900°C. The mercury yield of these compounds during activation is however of less than 50%, while the remaining mercury is slowly released during the lamp life. European patent applications Nos. 95830046.9 (EP-A-0669639) and 95830284.6 (EP-A-0691670), in the applicant's name suggest to mix the above-mentioned mercury intermetallic compounds with copper-tin and copper-silicon alloys, called promoting alloys, which have the function of favoring the mercury release from the intermetallic compound during the activation step thus allowing shorter heating times or at lower temperatures. Since in the shielding elements of the present invention copper-based promoting alloys are always present admixed with mercury intermetallic compounds, in the rest of description and in the claims the definition "mercury releasing material" will be used to indicate this mixture of materials.<br>
Another problem to be faced in the production of fluorescent lamps is that of providing means for the sorption of reactive gases. In fact it is known that the lamps operation is impaired, through various mechanisms, by some gases: hydrogen  (Hj)<br><br>
interacts with a fraction of the electrons emitted in the discharge in the rare gas, whereby it causes an increase of the minimum voltage required to switch on the lamp; oxygen (O2) and water (HjO) produce mercury oxide, thus removing this element; finally carbon oxides CO and CO2 decompose in contact with the electrode thus forming O2, with the above mentioned negative effect, and carbon which is deposited onto the phosphors thus creating dark zones in the lamp.<br>
This problem too is faced in EP-A-0669639 and EP-A-0691670, which suggest to add powders of a getter material to the powders of the mercury releasing material in view of the sorption of the above-mentioned gases. The getter material most commonly used is the alloy having the percent composition by weight Zr 84% - Al 16%, manufactured and sold by the applicant under the tradename St 101. Other getter materials which can be used in the lamps are for example the alloy having the percent composition by weight Zr 70% - V 24,6% - Fe 5,4% and the alloy having a percent composition by weight Zr 76,6% - Fe 23,4%, both manufactured and sold by the applicant under the tradenames St 707 and St 198, respectively.<br><br>
It is known from the prior art to provide directly on the shielding members surrounding the electrodes both the getter material and the mercury releasing material, thus including in the same member all the three functions of Hg dispensing, reactive gases sorption and electrodes shielding. This member is simply called "shield" in the art, and this term will be used in the following description.<br>
While in patent US 3.657.589 it was possible to mix the getter material with the mercury releasing material, this is no longer possible when copper-based promoting alloys are employed: in fact, during the activation for mercury releasing, the copper-based alloys melt, thus coating at least partially the getter surface with consequent reduction of its functionality as to gases sorption. For this reason when using promoting alloys it is preferable that the getter material is separate from the mercury releasing material. This can be obtained in the most convenient way by depositing on an strip-shaped support separate tracks of powdered mercury releasing material and of powdered getter. The above-mentioned European patent applications already suggest the possibility<br><br>
of complying with this condition by depositing the two powders onto both opposite faces of the strip through cold rolling. Such a technique consists in passing the cold support strip and powders, in a suitable configuration, between pressure rollers, thus obtaining a track of the powder. However, the deposition onto both opposite faces of the strip is difficult to be carried out in practice. As a natter of fact, rolling onto both faces in a single vorking step requires passing the strip vertically Detween two opposite rollers while pouring two different powders from the two opposite sides of :he strip, but this operation is rather complicated. On the other hand, when carrying out :he deposition onto the opposite faces in two iistinct passages, the risk exists that during the second rolling step the first deposit track may be removed or anyhow altered. A possible further risk 3f rolling onto both faces of the strip is that if :his is bent to produce the shield, the powder may 3e removed, in particular that on the concave portion of the bending. Finally, a last possible irawback met when rolling the powders is bound to •,he use of different powders. In fact, powders of iifferent hardness induce in the support metallic<br><br>
strip mechanical strains of different intensity which, if not balanced, cause its deformation; in particular the strip may become stretched along one of its sides, resulting in a lateral bending (sabre-blade shaping).<br>
Object of the present invention is of providing a process for the production of an improved shield for fluorescent lamps which combines the functions of mercury dispensing and gas gettering without showing the above-mentioned drawbacks. Another object of the invention is the thus produced shield.<br>
Such objects  are  obtained according  to  the<br>
present invention, that, in a first aspect thereof<br>
relates to a process for producing a device for<br>
mercury dispensing,  reactive  gases  sorption and<br>
electrode  shielding  within  fluorescent  lamps,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
depositing a variable number of tracks of<br>
powdered mercury releasing material and of one or<br>
more powdered getter materials on a single face of<br>
a metallic strip by a cold rolling operation such<br>
that the difference of mechanical strain applied at<br>
centtal<br>
two points symmetric with respect to the/axis of the strip is not higher than 15%;<br><br>
-	cutting the strip in pieces with a pitch that is either slightly larger than the circumference, or equal to the height, of the shield to be produced;<br>
-	ring-shaping the piece of strip and joining together the two short edges thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a device for mercury dispensing, reactive gases sorption and electrode shielding in fluorescent lamps, comprising a ring-shaped piece of a metallic strip (10; 20; 30;), on a single face of which there are deposited tracks (13, 13'; 23, 23', 23") of powders of a mixture mercury releasing material/copper based promoting alloy and tracks (15; 24, 24') of one or more getter materials.<br><br>
The invention will be described in the following<br>
by way of non-limiting examples, with reference to accompanying<br>
the/drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a possible strip for the production of shields according to the invention,-<br>
Figure 2 shows a possible strip for the production of shields according to an alternative embodiment of the invention,-<br>
Figure 3 shows a possible cross-section (not scale representations) of the metallic support employed for the production of a preferred shape of inventive shields,-<br>
Figure 4 shows a shield of the invention obtained through the strip of figure 1;<br>
Figures  5 .a  and  5.b  show  two  preferred embodiments of shields according to the invention, obtained from the strip of figure 2; and<br>
Figure 6 shows a cut-away view of a lamp with a shield according to the invention being mounted in<br><br>
its working position about an electrode.<br>
As stated before, the tracks of the various materials are deposited onto a single face of the support metallic strip by cold-rolling, that is a well-known technique consisting in casting tracks of loose powders on a support strip continuously-fed under rollers that cause the powders to adhere to the support by cold compression.<br>
The strip can be made of various metals; however the use of nickel-plated steel is preferred, that combines good mechanical properties with a good resistance to oxidation which could occur during the working steps at high temperature of the lamp. The thickness of the strip is preferably comprised between 0,1 and 0,3 mm. The width of the strip may correspond to the height of the final shield, generally between 4 and 6,5 mm, or be slightly larger than the circumference of the designed shield; these two options are illustrated respectively in figures 1 and 2, and discussed in detail in the following.<br>
To avoid the pirob^lem of the so-called "sabre-blade" shaping of the strip, during the rolling of the materials, care must be taken to exert mechanical strains on the strip that are symmetric<br><br>
with respect to the axis of the same strip. Hereafter, when referred to mechanical strain, the concept of symmetry will be given a rather relaxed meaning, that is, it will not mean strict equality of values of mechanical load; rather, it will imply that mechanical loads applied to points geometrically symmetric with respect to the central axis of the strip are similar, and not different from each other by more than 15% in value.<br>
The condition of symmetrical strain can be obtained in various different ways: in case of an uneven distribution of the powder tracks around the axis of the strip, it is possible to employ an array of narrow rollers, each one applying a different load to the strip section underneath, either covered with a powder track or not. More easily, the symmetric strain condition above can be reached by depositing the various materials in such a way that<br>
symmetrical tracks with respect to the axis of the<br>
I* strip consist of materials having hardness values<br>
which do not differ from each other by more than<br>
15%.  Under a geometrical aspect,  this condition<br>
requires that in case of a pair number of tracks,<br>
the axis of the strip be free from rolled material,<br>
while in the case of an odd number of tracks the<br><br>
axis of the strip be coincident with the axis of one material track. In order to satisfy the above-mentioned condition of symmetry it is necessary to know the hardness of the various materials employed. As a general rule, one can say that the getter alloys are harder than the mercury releasing intermetallic compounds. However, in a preferred embodiment, the required condition of hardness symmetry is simply met by symmetrically depositing, with respect to the strip axis, pairs of tracks of the same material (except for the possible central track).<br>
Sections of possible strips with symmetric tracks of materials are shown in figures 1 and 2. In fig. 1 it is shown a strip 10 having width equal to the height of the final shield, wherein on a face 11 of the metallic support 12 there are deposited some tracks 13, 13' of mercury releasing material and one track 15 of getter material. In the drawing, only by way of example, a strip with two tracks of mercury releasing material and one track of getter material is represented, but of course number, position and distance of these tracks may var;y according to the requirements. In fig. -2 it is shown a metallic strip 20, having a width larger than the strip of fig. 1<br><br>
and slightly greater than the circumference of the shield to be manufactured. In the central area of a face 21 of the support 22 there are rolled the tracks 23, 23', 23" of the mercury releasing material and the tracks 24, 24' of the getter material; in this case an example is given of a strip with three tracks of mercury releasing material and two tracks of getter material, but it should be clear, as already stated in case of strip of fig. 1, that these numbers are variable. At the strip edges two areas 25, 25' of face 21 are left free of tracks of materials. The thickness of the tracks of different materials after rolling is generally between 20 and 120 \xm.<br>
In order to assist the adhesion of the tracks of powder onto the strip it is possible to resort to techniques known in the field; for example, the strip surface can be made rugged by mechanical treatments; in alternative, it is possible to form along the entire length of the strip some depressions adapted to receive the powder tracks. This option is shown in fig. 3, representing the cross-section of a possible strip of the invention (not scale drawing with a very emphasized thickness/width ratio to better show the details of<br><br>
interest): a strip 30 has on its upper face 31 seats<br>
32, 32',	, for rolling of the active materials.<br>
Providing longitudinal deformations 34, 34',..., on lower face 33 of strip 30 may result to be useful to assist in the production of a preferred type of shield, as better described in the following. This or other suitable cross-sections of the strip may be easily obtained by causing the flat metallic strip to pass between suitably shaped rollers before the step of powders rolling.<br>
The strip with tracks of materials is then cut in pieces. A strip of the kind shown in fig. 1, having a width equal to the height of the desired shield, is cut at a pitch slightly greater than the circumference of the shield, along the dashed lines in the drawing; in an alternative embodiment illustrated in fig. 2, the strip may be slightly wider than the designed shield circumference, and pieces are cut from this strip at a pitch corresponding to the height of the desired shield, along the dashed lines in the drawing. In both cases, the pieces are of rectangular shape, with edges ratio generally comprised between about 5:1 and 15:1.<br>
In the final step of production of the shields<br><br>
of the inventions, the pieces cut from the strip are bent and closed in a ring-shape, by joining the short edges of the piece. The joining may be realized mechanically, for instance by crimping, or by welding. Although it is possible to obtain various shapes of the shield cross-section, such as the oval-shaped or square cross-section, the preferred embodiments are those shown in figures 5a and 5b, respectively showing the shield 51 with circular cross-section and the shield 52 with substantially rectangular cross-section.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention relates to the shields for lamps obtained by the process described above.<br>
The actual shield to be produced depends on the lamp to which it is destined; in particular, the amount of materials, and thus the number and width of the tracks to be deposited depend on the quantity of mercury releasing material and getter material which are required in the different lamps.<br>
The mercury releasing materials are intermetallic compounds of mercury with titanium and/or zirconium according to the mentioned patent US-3.657.589, in admixture with the copper alloys enhancing the mercury release as described in EP-A-<br><br>
0669639 and EP-A-0691670 in the applicant's name. For the preparation and conditions of mercury-release from these materials it is referred to the above-mentioned documents. These materials are preferably employed in powdered form with particle size between 100 and 250 ^im.<br>
The getter material utilized is preferably the mentioned St 101 alloy, disclosed in the patent US-3.203.901 to which reference is made as to preparation and conditions of use of the alloy. It is also possible to use the mentioned St 707 and St 198 alloys, whose preparations and conditions of utilization are described in patents US-4.312.669 and US-4.306.887, respectively. The particle size of the getter material is preferably comprised between 100 and 250 ^im.<br>
In figure 4 there is shown a shield 40 manufactured by using the strip of fig. 1, wherein the tracks are shown to be deposited in a circumferential direction. The strip of fig. 1 is cut along the dashed lines with a pitch which is slightly greater than the shield circumference; the piece thus obtained is bent as a ring and spot-welded at points 41, thus forming a complete shield 40 bearing the tracks 13, 13' and 15 on   its outer<br><br>
surface 42.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the shield according to the invention are obtained starting from the strip of fig. 2 and shown in the figures 5a and 5b. At the strip edges two areas 25, 25' are kept free from deposits of material and left available for the final welding step of shield production. In this case the strip is severed by making cuts with a pitch corresponding to the desired height of the shield, along the dashed lines of fig. 2. The obtained pieces are then bent and welded at areas 25, 25', thus obtaining shields in which the tracks of the various materials are present onto the outer surface 54 of the shield in a direction parallel to the axial direction. The possible cross-sections of the shields are numerous, but preferred are those shown in figures 5a, in which a shield 51 of circular cross-section is shown, and 5b, showing a shield 52 with substantially rectangular cross-section. The use of the wide strip of fig. 2 is preferred because in this case a wide free area is available for carrying out the weldings 53 as well as free areas for welding the shield to the support keeping it in position within the lamp.<br>
The shape of shield 52 may result particularly<br><br>
preferred when obtained starting from a strip having che cross-section shown in fig. 3. With the shield 52 having an essentially rectangular cross-section it is possible to locate bends of the piece in areas free from tracks of materials, thus preventing any risk at all of loosing particles, which could be present during the bending. Of course, even though a rectangular shield obtained from a strip of cross-section as shown in fig. 3 is preferred, all combinations of shapes of the shield and cross-sections of the strip are possible according to the invention; for instance, it is possible to produce a rectangular shield starting from a strip having notches 34, 34',.., but without seats 32, 32', ..., or a shield of circular cross-section using a strip without notches 34, 34',..., and with or without seats 32, 32',... on the outer face of the shield. In figure 6 there is illustrated a cut-away view of the end portion of a rectilinear lamp, showing a shield of the invention in its working position. Lamp 60, electric contacts 61 feeding the electrode 62 with electric power and a shield 63 fixed to a support 64 are shown in the drawing.<br>
The  shields  of  the  invention  have  many advantages with respect to those of the prior art.<br><br>
The main advantage is that with the shields of the invention the mercury releasing materials are kept separate from the getter materials, thus avoiding possible interferences in the functioning of the various materials; furthermore, with the shields of the invention all the materials are rolled on a single face of the support, thus avoiding that the two opposite faces are rolled as required for some shields of the prior art which are of difficult manufacture in practice.<br><br><br>
