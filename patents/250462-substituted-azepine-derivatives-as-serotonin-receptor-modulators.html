SUBSTITUTED AZEPINE DERIVATIVES AS SEROTONIN RECEPTOR MODULATORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a series of compounds, to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and to use of the compounds and compositions as therapeutic agents More specifically, compounds of the present invention are hexahydrothienoazepine and octahydi othienoazepme compounds. These compounds are serotonin receptoi (5-HT) Hgands and are useful for treating diseases, disorders, and conditions wherein modulation of the activity of serotonin receptors (5-HT) is desired (e.g. addiction, anxiety, depression and obesity)<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases, disorders, and conditions that originate in the central nervous system, including diseases, disorders, and conditions related to, for example, sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, addiction and schizophienia Serotonin also plays an important role in peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of conti actile, secietory, and electrophysiologic effects<br>
Because of the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is a need for drugs that affect serotonergic systems In particular, agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists of serotonergic systems aie of interest for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disordeis, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders (e g, Alzheimer's disease, Parkmsonism, and Huntington's chorea), and chemothei apy-induced vomiting.<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HTi_7) contain one to seven separate receptors that have been formally classified See Glennon, et al., Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews, 1990,14, 35, and D Hoyer, et al. Pharmacol Rev 1994,46, 157-203.<br>
For example, the 5-HT2 family of leceptors contains 5-HT2a, 5-HT2b, and 5-HT2c subtypes, which have been grouped together on the basis of primary structure, secondary messenger system, and operational profile All three 5-HT2 subtypes are G-protein coupled, activate phospholipase C as a principal transduction mechanism, and contain a seven-<br><br>
WO 2006/004931	PCT/US2005/023282<br>
transmembrane domain structure. There are distinct differences in the distribution of the three 5-HT2 subtypes in a mammal The 5-HT2b and 5-HT2a receptors are widely distributed in the peripheral nervous system, with 5-HT2a also found in the brain. The 5-HT2c receptor has been found only in the central nervous system, being highly expressed in many regions of the human brain See G Baxter, et at. Trends in Pharmacol Sci 1995,16, 105-110.<br>
Subtype 5-HT23 has been associated with effects including vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and bronchoconstnction, as well as certain CNS effects, while subtype 5-HT2C has been associated with diseases that include depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, addiction, panic disorders, phobias, psychiatric syndromes, and obesity. Very little is known about the pharmocologic role of the 5-HT2b receptor. See F Jenck, et al., Exp Opm Invest Drugs, 1998, 7, 1587-1599; M Bos, etal, J Med. Client, 1997, 40, 2762-2769; J.R Martin, et al, Hie Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1998, 286, 913-924; S M Bromidge, et al, \.Med Chem, 1998,41,1598-1612, GA Kennett, Drugs, 1998,1, 4,456-470; and A Dekeyne, et al, Neurophannacology,1999, 38, 415-423.<br>

These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also he desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride and the like Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin,1<br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, macrocrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as pblylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides) Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile<br>
