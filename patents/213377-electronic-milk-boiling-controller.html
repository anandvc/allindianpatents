ELECTRONIC   MILK   BOILING CONTROLLER<br>
RAJENDRA PRASAD AGRAWAL,<br>
SHADE NO. 7 , ( MPLUN ), INDUSTRL4L AREA,<br>

INDIAN<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARL DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMEDTECHNICAL FIELD<br><br><br>
TECHANICAL FIELD<br><br>
This invention relates to an electronic milk boiling controller to used for putting off Gas stove when milk boiling.<br>
In present scenario life has become very fast and every body wants to atomize his daily working to avoid tensions and get himself busy in some productive work .<br>
For example if we take up a process of boiling of milk in kitchens it is a daily routine and a simple work , but due to busy life and routine problems the persons boiling the milk normally forgets to switch off Gas when milk has boiled which results in overflow of milk , choking of gas burners . And of course gas flame quenches due to over flow of milk but supply of gas is still open and hence chances of accident are their and also loss of precious fuel.<br>
This in turn makes a simple work of boiling of milk into a tedious job . The process of hardly 15 min turns up into a good job of half hour or 45 min . And in our very tight schedule we can not afford to loose time , Hence the product mentioned here under is a step forward in atomization of a daily routing work like boiling of milk and hence saving time and routing tension so that our precious time is saved in monitoring boiling of milk till the whole process completes and hence saving of valuable time ,<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
2<br><br>
Our claimed invention is a " electronic device ״ to be<br>
operated with the help of batteries .A valve is fitted in<br>
between gas cylinder and stove . A sensor is fixed in the vessel in which the milk is to be boiled . When the milk starts boiling a signal is transmitted which in turn is<br>
processed with the help of signal conditioning circuit and the valve is turned off. Hence supply of gas is stopped and milk is protected from over flow .<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In the conventional device a milk pot specifically designed for boiling of milk was developed . it was a double walled utensil made of Aluminum , Water was filled between the walls and a pressure valve was fixed for alarm . Principle being boiling point of water was increased by increasing the pressure and milk was boiled by heat transfer through water the setting of pressure valve was so set that as soon as the milk used to boil it used to alarm the person through whistle as in pressure cooker . But in this conventional system major drawbacks are :<br>
a.	Use of special type of expensive utensils / pot.<br>
b.	Water to be filled between bi-layer of pot as medium<br>
at every use .<br>
c.	Special utensil / pot had less life due to scaling and<br>
corrosion effect inside the wall of utensil /pot.<br>
d.	Can not identify accurate boiling point of the pot, it<br>
can vary on conditions .<br>
e.	Quantity used in the applied pot is fixed, user can<br>
not change the quantity of milk .<br>
3<br><br>
f.       After whistling of alarm, user have to put off gas knob of burner manually and have no, arrangement<br>
to put off automatically .<br>
But in our claimed invention of this device all these draw backs are rectified . The device is fixed in the gas line itself and can be used with any pot to boil the milk without any monitoring or tension . The user starts the process of boiling of milk unmonitored and can utilize this time for some other important work . As soon as the milk boils Sensors activate the valve and Gas is turned off immediately .<br>
OBJECTIVE OF INVENTION Objective of claimed invention are<br>
•	To save the valuable time of user, device will automatically put off at the time of boiling of milk , no need to monitor personally .<br>
•	Avoid the wastage of costly fuel like LPG gas with the help of "auto - turn off valve" . at the time of boiling valve installed between burner and cylinder will turn off supply of fuel automatically<br>
•	Reduce Accident Rate through claimed device , most of the accident cases caused by ignorance of user . with the help of this device gas supply of gas<br>
stove will automatically cut off through cylinder.<br>
4<br><br>
hence there is no chance of gas leakage after quenching of flame due to over flow of milk.<br><br>
•<br>
 Burners are always clean because there are no problems of spitting of milk hence choking problems of burners is avoided .<br>
SUMMARY ON INVENTION<br>
Claimed invention is a electronic gadget used in the process of boiling of milk which automatically turns off the gas when the milk starts boiling . The user can leave the process unmonitored and can do some other important work . The device avoids wastage of fuel and milk and also avoids the chances of accident due to leakage of gas . where as if the process is performed manually there are 40 % chances of milk overflow and gas leakages .<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides An Electronic controller used for putting off Gas stove when boiling of milk comprising a liquid sensor mounted to a stainless steel mess utensil closure, the said sensor is connected to the input of an electronic signal conditioning circuit; the out put of the said circuit is connected to an electromechanical actuator of a<br>
1. valve; and the said valve having an inlet adapted to connect to gas regulator and an outlet connected to inlet of a gas stove.<br>
5<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING<br>
DRAWING<br>
As Seen from the Block diagram enclosed it self the milk saver consists of Stainless steel wire mesh (1), Sensors (2) Attached to it in order to provide input signal to signal conditioning Circuit (3) then followed by an Electromechanical Actuator (4) which operates a Gas Valve (5) which is fixed in between Gas cylinder and gas stove .<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Milk to be Boiled is kept in the vessel on gas stove . A stainless steel wire mesh (1 ) fitter with the Sensors (2) is kept at the top of the vessel. The sensors are attached with Electronic signal Conditioning circuit ( 3 ) which senses signal from the sensors and<br>
In turns operates Electromechanical Actuator ( 4 ) and hence the valve ( 5 ) turns off.<br>
When the milk boils and is sensed by the probes of the sensor<br>
A signal is passed through them . The signal conditioning circuit<br>
Amplifies this signal and activates actuator which in turn cuts off<br>
The supply of gas with the help of gas valve attached in between Gas stove and cylinder .<br>
When this process is complete the gas knob has to be switched off manually and the gas valve has to be reset and now<br>
6<br><br>
The gas can be used again.<br>
And hence eliminating continuous monitoring of the system The system is fully automatic and reliable . This causes saving of precious time and also mental tension .<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
As clearly seen from the block Diagram a Mechanical gas valve is fitted in series with the gas cylinder and gas stove . The gas valve is normally open and the triggering of the valve is electronically controlled with the help of Actuator which converts electrical signal received from the signal conditioning circuit to displacement of the valve hence turning the valve off.<br>
A set of probes is inserted from the SS Wire mesh cover provided on the vessel on which the milk is to be boiled . the probes sense the level of milk through out the process of boiling and as soon as the milk starts boiling and reaches top a signal is sensed by the signal conditioning circuit and which in turn activates the actuator turning off Valve in the end and hence gas turns off.<br>
After completion of the process the valve is reset again and now the gas stove can be used for other purposes .<br>
7<br><br>
I CLAIM<br>
An Electronic   Milk   Boiling Controller used for putting off Gas stove when boiling of milk comprising a liquid sensor mounted to a stainless steel mess utensil closure, the said sensor is connected to the input of an electronic signal conditioning circuit; the out put of the said circuit is connected to an electromechanical actuator of a valve; and the said valve having an inlet adapted to connect to gas regulator and an outlet connected to inlet of a gas stove.<br>
