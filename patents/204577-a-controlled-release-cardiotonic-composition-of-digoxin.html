THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10)<br>
A CONTROLLED RELEASE CARDIOTONIC COMPOSITION OF DIGOXIN<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
The  following  specification  particularly describes  and  ascertains  the  nature  of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a cardiotonic composition. More specifically, the present invention relates to a cardiotonic composition that releases digoxin reproducibly at a specified rate over a duration of 1 hour.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Digoxin, one of the cardiac (or digitalis) glycosides, is known for use in the treatment of congestive heart failure. When administered at the proper therapeutic dosage level, digoxin exerts a direct cardiotonic effect on the myocardium to increase the force of contraction and improve cardiac tone. It has a narrow therapeutic index, i.e. the dose producing the toxic or other undesirable side effects is not much greater than the therapeutically effective dose. Several side effects encountered in the treatment with cardiac glycosides are related to a peak in plasma concentration often occurring a few hours after administration of a dose. Very rapid initial rate of release results in higher peak plasma levels and therefore more side effects. On the other hand, if digoxin is released too slowly from tablets into gastrointestinal fluids then incomplete absorption occurs. The United States Pharmacopoeia [USP XXIV &amp; NF XIX (The United States Pharmacopoeia Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md. 1999)] sets a specification for digoxin tablets requiring that at least 85 % digoxin be released in 60 minutes.<br>
German Patent DE 1467788 discloses compositions that contain digoxin in solution, sodium alginate and polyacryalmide for gradual and controlled release of digoxin. The patent relates to a liquid composition and does not teach or disclose the preparation of a tablet dosage form providing the desired release profile of the present invention.<br>
Prior art compositions either relate to improving the solubility or dissolution rate of digoxin to enhance its bioavailability or relates to enteric coated compositions that do not release digoxin in acidic gastric fluids or relate to controlled release of digoxin over much longer periods than stipulated herein in the present invention. Whereas very rapid initial rate of release results in higher plasma level and more side effects, prior art does not discuss or disclose a composition<br>
2<br><br>
higher plasma level and more side effects, prior art does not discuss or disclose a composition that releases not more than 50% digoxin at 5 minutes when tested in vitro in United States Pharmacopoeia Type I Dissolution apparatus using 500 ml of 0.1N HC1 at 120 rpm for 60 minutes at 37 C. The commercial tablets marketed under the name Lanoxin® releases more than 50 % digoxin at 5 minutes when tested under these conditions.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the instant invention to provide a cardiotonic composition in the form of a tablet that releases not more than 50% digoxin in 5 minutes and at least 85% of digoxin in 60 minutes when tested in vitro in Unitedstates Pharmacopoeia Type I Dissolution apparatus using 500 ml of 0. IN HC1 at 120 rpm for 60 minutes at 37° C.<br>

Digoxin (micronized) was mixed with small quantity of lactose monohydrate and passed through 40 Mesh sieve. This blend was charged in mixer, sandwiching between lactose and Hydroxy propyl methylcellulose and mixed for 5 minutes. The powder mixture was granulated with purified water till the wet mass attained optimum consistency. The granules were dried at about 45-55 C in the tray drier to a Loss on Drying of 1-3 %. The dry granules were sifted through 20mesh sieve. The oversize granules were milled through multimill fitted with 2 mm screen at slow speed and again passed through 20mesh sieve. The milled granules were blended with magnesium stearate in a double cone blender for 5 minutes. The granules were compressed on 7.0 mm round, standard concave punches at compression weight of 120 mg.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
The dissolution profile of the tablets of Example 1, 2, 3 and commercial tablets marketed under the brand name of Lanoxin® were tested in vitro in USP type I dissolution apparatus at 120rpm in 500ml of 0.1 N HCL at 37+0.5°C. The drug delivery characteristics of the tablets are recorded in Table 5 below.<br>

The dissolution profile of composition of Example 1 of the present invention indicated a controlled release of digoxin over a period of 60 minutes.    The composition according to<br>
9<br><br>
Example 2 released digoxin rapidly within 15 minutes. The bioavailability data for Example 2 as described in Table 6 also indicated a higher peak plasma levels which may lead to untoward side effects. The dissolution profile of Example 3 indicated an undesirable, incomplete release profile. This effect was attributed to the microcrystalline nature of digoxin. The commercial tablets marketed under the name Lanoxin® releases more than 50% digoxin at 5 minutes as indicated by its release profile.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The bioavailability of digoxin from compositions prepared according to process described in Example 1 and Example 2 were evaluated. The design of the study was a single dose, open lable randomized, comparative two-way crossover study in comparison to Lanoxin® commercial digoxin Tablets by Burroughs Welcome in ten human volunteers under fasting conditions. Each subject received, in random sequence, an oral dose of two tablets of 0.25 mg digoxin with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. A wash out period of 21 days was given in between the doses. The bioavailability parameters such as Cmax, Tmax and AUC were recorded. The results are given in Table 6 and Table 7 for Example 2 and Example 1, respectively.<br>

The in vitro dissolution profile of composition according to Example 2 as given in Table 5 indicates a rapid release of 98 % of digoxin in 15 minutes. Moreover, the bioavailability data as described in Table 6 shows higher peak plasma which may lead to untoward side effects. The in vitro dissolution profile of the composition according to Example 1 as given in Table 5 indicates a controlled release of digoxin over a duration of 60 minutes. The bioavailability study indicates a desirable peak plasma level of 2.27 ng/ml as compared to the Commercial Tablets justifying the object of the present invention.<br>
