				<td>FUEL CELL WITH PROTON CONDUCTING MEMBRANE AND<br>
WITH IMPROVED WATER AND FUEL MANAGEMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to fuel cells, and more particularly to a fuel<br>
cell having a solid, proton-conducting membrane.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device wherein hydrogen or an organic fuel<br>
is reacted with oxygen to generate electricity and to produce water. The reactants<br>
fed into a fuel cell need not be pure, for the oxygen can be taken from the<br>
atmosphere and the hydrogen extracted from natural or synthetic fuels. The basic<br>
fuel process is efficient and pollution-free. However, since a single fuel cell yields<br>
an output of less than one volt, in order to provide a useful output it is necessary to<br>
connect a group of cells in series in a stack or in a flat formation, to create a power<br>
pack.<br>
As a converter of energy, a fuel cell differs from a conventional voltaic cell<br>
or battery in which anode and cathode electrodes cooperate with an electrolyte, in<br>
that in a fuel cell the electrodes are invariable and catalytically active. Current is<br>
generated in a fuel cell by reactions on the electrode surfaces in contact with the<br>
electrolyte. These reactions involve (i) oxidation of hydrogen or organic fuel on an<br>
anode functioning as the negative electrode, as in a galvanic cell, giving rise to<br>
hydrated protons with the release of electrons, and (ii) reduction of oxygen on the<br>
cathode and producing water as electrons are consumed.<br>
The first practical fuel cell was developed by General Electric (GE) for<br>
NASA in connection with the Gemini program. Included in this cell was an<br>
electrolyte in the form of a solid polymeric membrane, referred to as an<br>
"ionic-exchange membrane". The GE membrane was composed of a lace-like<br>
organic structure with an ionic group bonded firmly thereto, and hydrogen ions<br>
loosely held in the polymer chain to provide sufficient mobility for ionic support.<br>
Fuel cells having polymeric membranes are disclosed in US Patents<br>
5,599,638 and 5,777,162. Commonly used, as a membrane material having<br>
proton-exchange properties is Nafion , manufactured by DuPont. When methanol<br>
serves as the fuel, electro-oxidation of methanol takes place at the anode, while<br>
electro-reduction of oxygen then occurs at the cathode to yield water. Protons<br>
generated at the anode are transported directly across the membrane to the cathode.<br>
The flow of current is sustained by ions flowing through the cell and by electrons<br>
passing through an external load.<br>
A solid proton-conductive membrane (PCM) of the type included in a fuel<br>
cell in accordance with the invention, is disclosed in PCT Publication WO<br>
99/44245 in the name of the same Applicant. Used in this membrane are polymeric<br>
binders selected from a group that includes polyvinylidendifluoride (PVDF)<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene and polymethylmethacrylate. Inorganic powders for<br>
preparing this membrane include SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3 and B2O3.<br>
Also of prior art interest is the fuel cell disclosed in PCT publication WO<br>
01/54216, in the name of the same Applicant. This cell includes an anode chamber<br>
to which fuel is supplied, and a cathode chamber to which oxygen is supplied.<br>
Interposed between the chambers is a solid electrolyte in the form of a<br>
proton-conducting membrane having fine pores whose diameter is smaller than<br>
30nm.<br>
In hydrogen and in direct oxidation fuel cells (DOFC) liquid water tends to<br>
leak through the cathode. This water may include fuel, resulting in a loss of fuel as<br>
well as water. Liquid water leakage through the cathode of a fuel cell having a solid<br>
electrolyte membrane such as Nafionâ„¢ can be serious, since the osmotic drag of<br>
water is about three water molecules per proton, or eighteen water molecules for<br>
each methanol molecule. This (if all the water exits the cathode) gives rise to a loss<br>
of up to lOg of water per one gram of methanol consumed in the cell reaction. And<br>
the osmotic drag of water by the protons may cause a build-up of hydraulic<br>
pressure at the catalyst layer of this cathode. This acts to increase leakage of liquid<br>
water or aqueous fuel solution through holes or cracks in the gas diffusion layer<br>
(GDL) of the cathode, as well as through the edge or periphery of the membrane<br>
and through the gap between the cathode-solid membrane-anode assembly (also<br>
termed in the art "membrane electrode assembly" or MEA) and the circular gasket<br>
of the cell.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the art to provide a novel<br>
efficient fuel cell with improved water and fuel management. Thus, the present<br>
invention provides an improved fuel cell that utilizes a proton conducting<br>
membrane sandwiched between an anode layer and a cathode layer and includes a<br>
system which prevents or substantially reduces the water leak from the cell. The<br>
present invention also provides means in a fuel cell having a system which prevents<br>
or substantially reduces the water leak from the cell, that release hydraulic pressure<br>
which builds up at the cathode in the course of operation.<br>
Briefly stated the above features are attained by a cathode and a fuel cell<br>
according to the invention, which is built to prevent escape of liquids, e.g. water<br>
and fuel solution, from the cell. The fuel cell of the invention comprises a plurality<br>
of superposed layers, where a proton-conducting membrane functions as a solid<br>
electrolyte and is sandwiched between an anode layer and a cathode layer which is<br>
water leak-proof. Hydrogen or an organic fuel is fed into the cell to react with the<br>
anode layer, and oxygen-containing air is fed into the cell to react with the cathode<br>
layer.<br>
According to the invention, the loss of liquids, e.g. water and aqueous fuel<br>
solution from the cell are prevented or substantially reduced by the following<br>
means:<br>
i)        A sealant material such as glue or a sealant cement between the edges<br>
of the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) and the gasket surrounding it;<br>
ii)       A sealant material sealing the proton conducting membrane edges: and<br>
iii)      A liquid-water leak-proof layer, located at any place between the PCM<br>
and the cathode  current collector.  Such  a liquid-water leak-proof layer is<br>
hydrophobic and has pores that are large enough to allow air or oxygen transport<br>
through it to the catalyst layer and small enough to prevent transport  of liquid<br>
from the cathode side outside the fuel cell. Typically, these conditions require<br>
that the pores will be larger than 0.001 microns, preferably larger then 0.01<br>
micron and smaller than 5 microns, preferably smaller than 0.5 microns.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect thereof, the present invention provides a<br>
cathode suitable for use in a fuel cell having a proton conducting membrane, the<br>
cathode comprising a plurality of layers including a catalyst layer and a<br>
hydrophobic porous support layer, wherein at least one of said plurality of layers is<br>
a liquid-water leak-proof layer, which allows gas to pass through it and prevents<br>
passage of liquid water and/or aqueous fuel solution.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst layer is<br>
the layer that functions as the liquid-water leak-proof layer. According to another<br>
embodiments, the leak-proof layer is embedded in the hydrophobic porous support<br>
layer or is directly applied on the catalyst layer between the PCM and the catalyst<br>
layer of the cathode.<br>
The present invention further provides an assembly built of an anode, a solid<br>
electrolyte membrane and a liquid-water leak-proof cathode as described above.<br>
Such an assembly is termed hereinafter "membrane electrode assembly"(MEA).<br>
The solid electrolyte membrane will be generally termed proton conducting<br>
membrane (PCM), and this term is used to encompass both proton exchange<br>
membranes such as Nafion     and proton conducting membranes such as those<br>
described in WO 01/54216.<br>
According to the present invention, escape of liquid water and fuel solution<br>
through the peripheric side surfaces (i.e. edges) of the MEA are prevented or<br>
substantially reduced by sealing the edges of the MEA with a sealant material that<br>
is capable of preventing the passage through it of water and'or aqueous fuel<br>
solution. Non-limiting examples of such sealant material are glue and sealing<br>
cement.<br>
Preferably, the sealing is located between the cathode edges and the proton<br>
conducting membrane, as well as on the edges of the proton conducting membrane.<br>
Fuel cell or fuel cell arrangements comprising the cathode or the MEA of<br>
the invention are also within the scope of the present invention. A specific<br>
example of a fuel cell that may utilize the cathode of the invention is a direct<br>
oxidation fuel cell (DOFC). Preferable fuels are those that undergo over 80%<br>
conversion to CO2, and leave only negligible amounts of nonvolatile side<br>
products when used as fuels in a fuel cell. Examples of such fuels are hydrogen,<br>
methanol, dimethyl oxalate, ethylene glycol and oligomers and polymers of<br>
ethylene glycol.<br>
The fuels may optionally comprise between about 0.1% to 10w/w percents<br>
of additives, which increase the viscosity of the fuel solution. These additives are<br>
preferably inert polymeric materials, which do not interfere with the operation of<br>
the cell, but minimize the leak of fuel solution through the seals of the DOFC and<br>
through the MEA, since they increases the solution viscosity up to the formation<br>
of a gel. Examples of such additives are polyacrylates such as polyacrylic acid<br>
and alkali metal salts of polyacrylic acid.<br>
The fuel cell of the invention comprises two supporting plates having<br>
sandwiched between them a stack of superposed layers, a gasket surrounding the<br>
cathode and a sealant material sealing any gap between the gasket and at least one<br>
of the layers in the stack.<br>
Because a fuel cell having a leak-proof cathode according to the invention<br>
experiences no substantial loss of water, it may happen that water returns from the<br>
cathode to the aqueous fuel solution tank, so that no room is left for additional fuel.<br>
This situation is more frequent with cells using hydrophilic proton conducting<br>
membranes, such as those described in WO 01/54216, and less frequent with cells<br>
using hydrophobic proton conductive membranes such as the commercially<br>
available Nafionâ„¢. Therefore, according to yet another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the fuel cell of the invention is equipped with means for controlling the<br>
evaporation of water from the cell. Such means may encourage evaporation of<br>
water from the cell and thus reduce the amount of water that returns to the fuel<br>
solution tank. A fuel cell of the invention may be further equipped with means to<br>
prevent hydraulic pressure built-up on the cathode in the course of operation of the<br>
cell. Such means may be particularly useful in fuel cells where a hydrophobic<br>
proton conducting membrane is used. Typically, such means will include water<br>
collectors, to collect water and solution that accumulates on the cathode. The water<br>
collectors may be connected to an exhaust duct that lets the water flowing out of<br>
the cell. The water may be then directed to the environment or back into the fuel<br>
solution tank, as required according to the liquid level in the fuel solution tank. The<br>
water collectors may be, for example, a set of hydrophilic channels pressed onto the<br>
cathode face, where the water is expected to accumulate, or a set of hydrophilic<br>
fibers, such as cotton fibers, placed where the water are expected to accumulate.<br>
The evaporation of water from the cell may be achieved by forcing a<br>
stream of air onto the external side of the cathode. This may be done, for example,<br>
by a blower or a compressor. In one embodiment, air is compressed through the<br>
oxygen flow channel of the cell in a flux that suffices not only to feeding the<br>
reaction with oxygen, but also for encouraging evaporation from the cell. In case of<br>
using a blower, the blower may preferably be powered by electricity generated by<br>
the fuel cell.<br>
Evaporation of water from the fuel cell may be reduced, when required, by<br>
reducing the portion of the cathode surface area through which vapor may<br>
evaporate. An arrangement for controlling the portion of the cathode surface area<br>
through which vapor may evaporate is built according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention as a barrier with holes of variable size. According to a non-limiting<br>
example such a barrier is constructed of a fixed perforated layer and a sliding<br>
perforated layer, wherein the portion of the cathode area through which vapor may<br>
evaporate is determined by the position of the sliding perforated layer in respect of<br>
the fixed perforated layer. Each of the perforated layers has between 0.5 to 10 holes<br>
per cm2 and the pores cover between 0.2 to 70% of the cathode area, more<br>
preferably between 2 to 30% of the cathode area in close and open position,<br>
respectively.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a hybrid power source comprising at least one fuel cell according to the<br>
invention, a DC-to-DC converter and a rechargeable battery. The fuel cell<br>
charges the battery and supplies the low power demand while the high power<br>
battery supplies the heavy loads. In such a hybrid power source it is possible to<br>
combine as few as two or three fuel cells (in a series combination) through a DC-<br>
to-DC converter to a battery and the obtained device is flat and thin. For<br>
example, to power a cellular phone it is possible to use a hybrid power source<br>
built of two thin methanol fuel cells, connected in a series combination, a DC-to-<br>
DC converter and a small high power lithium ion cell.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides a detector<br>
device capable of detecting whether there is a required amount of liquid in an<br>
appliance or not, while the orientation of the appliance in space is not fixed, e.g.<br>
portable devices. It should be understood that such an appliance (container) is a<br>
closed structure for containing a liquid medium, for example for supplying the<br>
liquid medium into another device to enable its operation. Considering a fuel cell<br>
application, such a container is a reservoir of at least one of the following: water.<br>
fuel, fuel solution and acid, and is used to supply this medium to the fuel cell. In<br>
the description below, this medium container is termed "fuel tank" or "fuel<br>
solution tank", but it should be understood that the use of this term does not limit<br>
the invention to this specific example of medium and appliance.<br>
The detector comprises an electrodes' arrangement (preferably composed<br>
of at least four electrodes) with the electrodes being arranged in a spaced-apart<br>
relationship in the container so as to be in contact with the inside space of the<br>
container, and be spaced from or be in physical contact with the inner surface of<br>
the fuel solution tank, such that they are capable of detecting the existence of<br>
liquid inside the tank in a number of planes (levels) defined by the number of<br>
electrodes, namely, the number of pairs of electrodes. For example, using four<br>
electrodes, six pairs of electrodes are provided defining six different planes<br>
(levels) in the tank. The electrodes are preferably located closer to the periphery<br>
region of the tank than to the center region thereof. For example, the tank may be<br>
shaped like a box, and each of the electrodes (preferably, at least four electrodes)<br>
is placed on or closer to a different side of the tank. Hence, at each orientation of<br>
the tank, a predetermined quantity of liquid in the tank will suffice to at least<br>
partly cover at least two of the electrodes. By applying voltage to the electrodes<br>
pair, the detection of whether at least one of these electrodes is in contact with the<br>
liquid medium in the tank or not, thereby detecting the existence of the liquid at<br>
the plane (level) defined by this electrodes pair. When the liquid level in the tank<br>
is smaller than said predetermined quantity (defined by certain threshold value),<br>
the device would detect lack of liquid.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a fuel<br>
cell system of the non-stack type in which neighboring cells in the system have a<br>
common wall or where their fuel tanks have a common wall, to equilibrate the<br>
concentration of the volatile fuel in the system.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a cellular<br>
phone comprising an antenna, an earphone, a fuel cell, a fuel tank and a water<br>
tank, wherein at least one of the fuel cell, fuel tank and water tank is located<br>
between said antenna and said earphone so that at least parr of the radiation<br>
irradiated from the antenna is absorbed by said fuel cell, fuel tank and/or water<br>
tank.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water Leak-Proof Cathode Structure:<br>
Fig. 1A schematically illustrates a fuel cell 8 according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The fuel cell 8 has a liquid-water leak-proof cathode<br>
structure in accordance with the invention. The cell is created by a stack of a<br>
plurality of layers fastened onto the face of a plastic case 10 by a pair of threaded<br>
bolts 11 and 12 received in diametrically-opposed bores in case 10. In the stack, the<br>
uppermost filter layer 13 which is on the cathodic-side current collector of the cell,<br>
functions as an air and humidity control layer. Fed into the cell on its anode side via<br>
an inlet 14 in case 10 is organic fuel, aqueous fuel solution or hydrogen, which<br>
reacts with oxygen to generate electricity and to produce water and CO2 in the case<br>
of direct oxidation of an organic fuel.<br>
Inlet 14 conducts incoming fuel into the fuel tank 14a to the lowermost layer<br>
15 in the stack of layers which functions as an anode current-collector. Layer 15<br>
underlies an anode layer 16, directly above of which is a proton-conducting<br>
membrane 17 (PCM). Overlying membrane 17 is a cathode layer 18 and cathode<br>
current collector 18a. Hence, the proton-conducting membrane 17 is sandwiched<br>
between the anode and the cathode of the fuel cell. The cathode layer 18 includes a<br>
catalyst, a liquid-water leak-proof layer and a hydrophobic porous carbon support<br>
layer. Above the cathode current collector 18a is a porous hydrophobic barrier film<br>
19 which lies under the air filter layer 13. Any gap between the PCM 17 and the<br>
case 10 is sealed by a layer of glue (20). Also shown is a glue layer 21, preventing<br>
water leakage from any place between the cathode 18 and the case 10. The gap<br>
between layers 18 and 18a seems in the figure to be larger than the gap between<br>
other layers in the stack because of the need to show the glue laysr 21. In practice,<br>
however, all layers (including 18 and 18a) are pressed together without any visible<br>
spacing between them.<br>
Fig 1B describes a fuel cell 30 having another layer structure, typical to a<br>
single cell which is part of a multi cell stack, wherein cells are stacked in series.<br>
The cell 30 includes an anode (31), a proton conducting membrane (33), a<br>
liquid-water leak- proof cathode according to the present invention (32), a gasket<br>
for the anode side (34) and a gasket for the cathode side (35). The fuel cell 30<br>
also includes a seal 37 (showed schematically only on one side but practically<br>
existing on all the gap between the cathode and the gasket), sealing a gap 36<br>
between the cathode edges and the gasket 35 and a seal 38 sealing the edges of<br>
the proton conducting membrane 33. The invention is not limited by sealing the<br>
above mentioned places, and each place in the cell from where water is observed<br>
to be leaking should be sealed similarly. The combination of the above seals with<br>
liquid-water leak-proof cathode resulted in a decrease of more than 20% in the<br>
crossover current of a 7 cm2 DMFC and therefore plays an important role in the<br>
efficiency of the fuel cell.<br>
Preferred sealant materials for the sealing according to the present<br>
invention are PVDF, poly-acrylic glue, tar-based cement and silicon-rubber<br>
cement all of which are impermeable to liquid water. However, other sealant<br>
materials compatible with the fuel solution and oxygen may also be used.<br>
By using a liquid-water leak-proof cathode and by sealing the gap between<br>
such cathode and the gasket surrounding it according to this invention, it is possible<br>
not only to reduce water loss due to proton osmotic drag to zero, but even to<br>
reverse the direction of water flow to form a net flow of water from the cathode to<br>
the anode through the membrane, according to the pressure developed in the<br>
cathode during the operation of the fuel cell. This is of special importance for small<br>
DOFCs in portable applications.<br>
Liquid-water leak-proof layers and their application within the present<br>
invention will now be explained with reference to commercial cathodes such as<br>
Etek Elite, where a gas diffusing layer (GDL) contains cracks and holes up to 25<br>
microns in width or in diameter. Liquid water leaks through these cracks to the<br>
outer side (air side) of the cathode. This leak is eliminated or significantly reduced<br>
by means of a liquid-water leak-proof layer consisting of a bydrophobic layer<br>
virtually free of holes and cracks larger than 5 microns, but still having pores larger<br>
than 0.001 microns to allow air or oxygen transport to the catalyst layer. Preferred<br>
dimensions of the pores in the leak-proof layer are between 0.01 and 0.5 microns.<br>
The liquid-water leak-proof layer according to the present invention may be<br>
anywhere between the PCM and the air-side of the cathode.<br>
In some cases, the catalyst layer is a liquid-water leak-proof layer. In such<br>
cases it typically has a thickness of 10 to 100 microns and is free of cracks or holes<br>
larger than 3 microns and it is applied directly on the membrane between the<br>
membrane and the porous support layer of the cathode.<br>
Alternatively, a Nafion layer of similar structure is located directly on the<br>
cathode catalyst layer between the PCM and the catalyst layer to serve as a<br>
liquid-water leak-proof layer.<br>
It should be noted that some cracks and holes may have length, width and<br>
depth of mutually different dimensions. According to the invention, the<br>
combination of these should be such that will not allow passage of liquid water<br>
(and/or fuel solution) through the wholes and cracks. The given dimensions (of<br>
between 0.001 to 5 microns, preferably between 0.01 to 0.5 microns) are given to<br>
illustrate the preferable diameter of a circular pore.<br>
The same liquid water leak takes place when using a proton conducting<br>
membrane in hydrogen fuel cell. The same means are useable in this case to<br>
minimize or block the leak of liquid water through the cathode.<br>
Preparation of liquid-water leak-poof cathode and oi'a complete fuel cell:<br>
Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared, as described in WO<br>
01/54216. The material for the liquid-water leak-proof layer is a paste that consists<br>
of 10-50% w/w PVDF or Teflon, or may consist of fluoro-polymers and<br>
perflouro-polymers (preferably 20-40%), 50-90% w/w, (preferably 60-80% w/w)<br>
carbon powders such as: Black Peari 2000. XC 72. Shawingan black, and various<br>
mixtures thereof, and 0-80% v/v (preferably 60% v/v) of pore-former such as<br>
propylene carbonate (PC) or ethylene glycol (EG).<br>
Using a plastic knife or soft paper, the paste is inserted into the pores of the<br>
Toray paper (5% - 50% w/w wet proofed, preferably 20%) to form a layer inside<br>
the Toray paper, close to its surface. Several such paste insertions are made. Each<br>
layer is left to dry for about 30 min and then wiped with a dry and clean cloth<br>
paper. Up to 5-7 layers of leak-proof material are needed in order to receive a<br>
uniform coating of 5 to 50 microns thick. After a satisfactory morphology is<br>
reached, the Toray paper with the leak-proof material is immersed into distilled<br>
water for about 2 minutes, followed by curing at 150 to 250Â°C for 0.5 to 2 hours.<br>
The Toray carbon paper with the embedded liquid-water leak-proof<br>
material, having pores size of 0.5 to 0.01 microns on which there is a catalyst layer<br>
was hot pressed to the PCM.<br>
Alternatively, a thick hydrophobic cathode catalyst layer may serve as a<br>
liquid-water leek-proof layer when it consists of holes smaller than 3 microns and<br>
larger than 0.001 microns.<br>
The sealing of the cathode edges was done as follows. A PVDF paste made<br>
by mixing 1-3 gr. of PVDF (SOLVEY) with 20-40 ml. of acetone with a magnetic<br>
stirrer for 2-4 hrs, was applied on the gap (interface) between the membrane and<br>
the cathode, overlapping 1-2 mm of the (carbon paper) cathode with an extra fine<br>
brush making a thin film 0.05-0.1 mm thick. The same paste was applied on the<br>
outside edge of the membrane by dipping the membrane edge in the PVDF paste.<br>
In this way, a complete sealing was effected of the periphery of the cathode and the<br>
membrane edges, so that water leak outside the cathode is prevented or<br>
substantially reduced.<br>
Several types of cells can be assembled with this water leak-proof cathode.<br>
A flat plastic case fuel cell was assembled in the following way: First the anode<br>
current collector (15 in Fig. 1A) was placed in its position in the plastic case (10 in<br>
Fig. 1A). A layer of glue (20 in Fig. 1A) was applied in its position and was left to<br>
dry for 15-30 min. The MEA (whose edges were sealed as described above) was<br>
placed on the anode current collector and was pressed onto the anode current<br>
collector.   A sealing cement (21 in Fig. 1A) was applied to form a gasket area<br>
overlapping 1-2 mm of the cathode, all the way to the plastic case 10. The cathode<br>
ink was prepared by mixing 10%-80% w/w Pt catalyst (Electrochem hi spec 6000),<br>
10%-40% w/w Nafion (Aldrich 5% Nafion solution), 5%-60% carbon powder<br>
such as Black Pearl 2000, XC 72, Shawingan black or various mixtures of these<br>
carbon powders and 0%-80% v/v of pore-former such as ethylene carbonate (EC),<br>
diethylcarbonate ( DEC), propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene glycol (EG) or their<br>
mixture. Alternatively, the cathode ink may be made of carbon supported Pt where<br>
the Pt content is between 10 to 90 w/w%. All the powders and the solutions were<br>
introduced into a ball mill and mixed with a mechanical vibrator for 10-100 min.<br>
The ink obtained was applied with a fine brush to the liquid-water leak-proof<br>
material supported by a Toray carbon paper as described above. The ink layer was<br>
heated to 40-60Â°C, and 3-4 layers of ink were needed (with 10-20 min. of drying<br>
time between each layer) in order to obtain a Pt loading of 4-6 mg/cm .<br>
Alternatively the cathodic catalyst ink was directly applied to the PCM and hot<br>
pressed to a 20% teflonated Toray paper with or without a leak-proof layer as<br>
described above to form a 10 to 50 micron thick layer.<br>
Devices for Controlling Water Evaporation from a Fuel Cell<br>
In operating a Direct Oxidation Fuel Cell (DOFC) having a water leak-proof<br>
cathode, no water loss is experienced and, in fact, in some cases there is an<br>
accumulation of water in the anode compartment and/or in the fuel solution. For<br>
example when using a methanol fuel cell, each mole of methanol (32g/mole) is<br>
converted into two moles of water (36g per two moles) and one mole of CO2,<br>
which leaves the cell. When using an effective water leak-proof cathode, water<br>
dragged into the cathode and water produced in the cathode return to the anode<br>
compartment through the membrane, and there is a net gain of water in the anode<br>
compartment or in the fuel tank, leaving no room to add fuel, making it impossible<br>
to charge the fuel cell with new fuel. In order allow recharging the fuel cell, one<br>
must make room in the fuel tank or in the anode compartment by removing some of<br>
the water. While some water is usually removed by evaporation from the cathode,<br>
in an environment characterized by high humidity or low temperature natural<br>
evaporation might become insufficient to afford the necessary room. This may also<br>
happen under more usual environmental conditions if the fuel cell is working to<br>
produce high power. Therefore, it may be stated that the present invention concerns<br>
not merely prevention of water leaking from fuel cell, but even a fuel cell that may<br>
be operated under water-balanced conditions, namely, that does not loose nor gains<br>
water during operation.<br>
One way to increase the water removal from the fuel cell is to promote<br>
evaporation by forcing a stream of air onto the outside of the cathode at a sufficient<br>
and controlled rate, in order to remove the excess of water. This may be done, as<br>
shown schematically in Fig. 2, by the use of a fan or blower 22. which is powered<br>
by fuel cell 23. It is best to combine this fan or blower with a water level sensor 24<br>
located either in the anode compartment or in the fuel solution tank which<br>
automatically activates the fan when the water level (or fuel solution level) rises<br>
above a predetermined level, and deactivates it when the water or fuel solution<br>
level is below another predetermined level.<br>
Another kind of a controller system according to the invention measures the<br>
humidity in the air inlet and in the air outlet and calculates the water loss and<br>
calculates continuously the water production rate (according to the power of the<br>
fuel cell), measures the temperature, calculates the air circulating rate that is<br>
sufficient to evaporate the water formed in the DOFC and run the blower at this<br>
rate.<br>
For medium and high power applications a state of the art DOFC operates<br>
at temperatures of about 60 to over 100Â°C with air circulation. Using a<br>
condenser, water is collected from the exhaust air stream and recycled back to the<br>
water tank. This water condenser and recycling system can be saved or at least<br>
reduced in size, at least for medium temperatures and medium power, by using a<br>
liquid-water leak-proof cathode according to the invention, in combination with<br>
evaporation control as described above.<br>
Devices for controlling building of hvdraulic pressure in a Fuel Cell<br>
In a fuel cell in accordance with the invention the osmotic drag of water by<br>
the protons produced in the anode may cause an unacceptable build-up of hydraulic<br>
pressure at the catalyst layer of the cathode. This pressure might cause catalyst<br>
flooding at high current densities and discharge of liquid water or aqueous fuel<br>
solution through the liquid-water leak-proof layer into the outer side of the cathode.<br>
It is desirable therefore, to release the pressure imposed on the cathode in the<br>
course of operation. Therefore, a fuel cell of the invention may be equipped with<br>
means to prevent hydraulic pressure built-up on the cathode in. the course of<br>
operation of the cell. As shown in Fig. 3, such means include water collectors 25,<br>
capable of collecting water and fuel solution. The water collectors 25 are connected<br>
to a drain pipe 27 through a manifold 27'. Drain pipe 27 lets the water out of the<br>
cell. Then, the water may be directed to the environment or back into the fuel<br>
solution tank, as required, by a separate control and delivery system (not shown).<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the water collectors 25 are a<br>
set of hydrophilic channels pressed onto the cathode face, where the water is<br>
expected to accumulate. According to another embodiment the water collectors 25<br>
are a set of hydrophilic fibers, such as cotton fibers, placed where the water are<br>
expected to accumulate. The size of the channels or fibers is typically 0.01 to 0.2<br>
mm in diameter and they are about 0.3 to 3mm apart.<br>
The precise location wherein water is expected to accumulate depends on<br>
the location of the liquid-water leek-proof layer.<br>
In cases where a PCM with liquid acid is used, a thin porous hydrophilic<br>
layer, such as carbon or glass may be applied in the location of water accumulation,<br>
to serve as liquid water collector rather than the water collectors of Fig 3.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a fuel cell according to Fig. 3, ready for stacking in parallel<br>
together with other fuel cells with the same configuration. In the fuel cell of Fig. 4<br>
the MEA 26 is sandwiched between front and rear layers 26A and 26B . The stack<br>
at its lower right corner has a fuel inlet 28, and at its right comer has an oxygen<br>
inlet 30. At its left lower corner, the stack has an oxygen outlet 31 and at its upper<br>
left comer a fuel outlet 29. At the bottom of the stack there is the water drain<br>
outlet 27. Evaporation rate may be controlled by the rate of air circulation through<br>
oxygen inlet 30 and hydraulic pressure may be released through drain outlet 27.<br>
Passive and Active Air Control Systems:<br>
As mentioned above, one source of water loss in a fuel cell in accordance<br>
with the invention is water vapor discharged by the cathode by diffusion into the air<br>
or the oxygen flow field. In flat cells there is a perforated current collector or a<br>
perforated sheet covering the backing layer. The number and size of the holes in<br>
this current collector affect both cell power and the rate of water evaporation. The<br>
larger the pores and their number, the higher is the rate of water evaporation. Up to<br>
a certain size and number of pores, the power of the cell increases. But a further<br>
increase in pore size and number do not raise the power but instead increases water<br>
loss by evaporation.<br>
The rate of water loss by evaporation increases with temperature and with<br>
the airflow rate on the cathode, and with a decrease in air humidity. A "W" factor is<br>
herein defined as the ratio between moles of water lost to the air to moles of fuel<br>
consumed in the cell reaction. We define an "H" factor as the ratio between moles<br>
of water discharged from the cathode to the air to moles of protons transferred from<br>
the anode to the cathode through the membrane.<br>
In oxidation of one methanol molecule, two molecules of water are formed<br>
and six protons are transferred through the membrane from the anode side to the<br>
cathode side. Hence under water-balanced operating conditions W = 2, and H = 1/3<br>
(or 2/6). This means that the rate of water loss equals the rate of water production<br>
in the cell reaction, there being no net loss of water in the cell and no need to add<br>
water to the cell. It is therefore important to design a fuel cell with H = 1/3 and W =<br>
2, in such case only fuel has to be added and there is a saving of weight and<br>
volume. However, if W is greater than 2 or PI is larger than 1/3, water has to be<br>
added to the cell and if W is smaller than 2 or H smaller than 1/3, water is needed<br>
to be removed from the fuel cell. For hydrogen, one molecule of water is formed<br>
for one molecule of hydrogen consumed (it means that W = 1 and H = lA under<br>
water-balanced operating conditions) and the consideration is similar so under<br>
balanced water operating conditions one mole of water is needed to be removed for<br>
each mole of hydrogen being consumed. For other fuels, like ethylene glycol and<br>
dimethyl oxalate, H and W have to be calculated according to the cell reaction.<br>
By using a leak-proof cathode in accordance with the invention, and static<br>
air, it is possible to control water loss by evaporation by controlling the size and the<br>
number of the holes in the cathode current collector. Using a leak-proof cathode 52<br>
as shown in Fig. 5, and a passive air and humidity control system comprising a<br>
perforated sheet 54 (optional) that covers the perforated cathode current collector<br>
53, it is then possible for a methanol fuel cell operating at room temperature, to<br>
reduce W from 8 to less than 1 and H from 1.5 to close to zero, with a negligible<br>
effect on cell power. This has been achieved by reducing the hole diameter (of<br>
either the cathode current collector layer or the of the perforated sheet) from 5 mm<br>
to 1 mm. In a state of the art methanol fuel cell the parameter H was measured to be<br>
2.9 (X. Ren and S. Gottesfield, J. Electrochem. Soc. 148, A87-A90 (2001). This<br>
means that in a state of the art methanol fuel cell, 2.9 water molecules have to be<br>
added to the cell per each proton that pass the membrane whereas with the fuel cell<br>
according to the present invention, no water or a negligible amount of water has to<br>
be added. Therefore the state of the art methanol fuel cell contains a large water<br>
tank that may be omitted according to the present invention, and is larger and<br>
heavier than a methanol cell according to the invention.<br>
Another way of controlling water evaporation is to add to the airside of the<br>
cathode, a large porous hydrophilic matrix containing holes for efficient air<br>
penetration to the cathode. A porous layer covering the cathode and having 0.5 -10<br>
holes per cm2 of cathode with a total pore area of 0.2 to 70 mm square per one<br>
square cm have been tested in the present invention. Smaller the total area of the<br>
holes, smaller W and H factors were measured.<br>
Another way to control the rate of water loss via evaporation is to provide<br>
variable size holes in the cathode current collector or in a special metal or plastic<br>
sheet that covers the cathode. This can be done by a set of plates having holes<br>
functioning as an air shuttle that slide with respect to each other, one being fixed<br>
and the other moveable. The holes openings vary from a maximum open state,<br>
which occur when the holes in the plates are superimposed, to a full close.<br>
An active air and humidity control system, as shown in Fig. 6 includes an air<br>
shutter which includes a fixed panel 65 having an array of breathing holes BH1<br>
bored therein. Slidable with respect to fixed panel 65 is a movable panel 66 having<br>
breathing holes BH2 which is movable from a position in which the breathing holes<br>
in the movable panel are in registration with those in the fixed panel to provide<br>
maximum air flow, to a position in which the holes in the panels are out of<br>
registration to cut off air flow. In practice, the fixed panel may be hollow to form a<br>
duct into which the movable panel is telescoped.<br>
The relative positions of the two panels of the air shutter is controlled by a<br>
controller. One type of such as a controller consists of a cylinder whose piston is<br>
operated by liquid vapor, adjusted to the air temperature, in a manner whereby it is<br>
fully open at low temperatures and almost closed at elevated temperatures. Or the<br>
shutter may be operated by a micro servo, relay or piezoelectric device 67. This<br>
device is activated by a controller 68 governed by a signal coming from sensors in<br>
the fuel tank or in the anode compartment (not shown) monitoring the water level.<br>
It opens the breathing holes when the water level passes a critical value and it<br>
permits a minimal opening level when operating the fuel cell when water is below<br>
the predetermined level.<br>
In a passive air control device as shown in Fig. 7, the breathing holes are of<br>
0.5 to 5 mm in diameter, and a thin humidity-sensitive porous matrix 70 is placed<br>
over the breathing holes sheet 69. Depending on the air humidity, the matrix 70<br>
changes its pores size, i.e. when the air humidity is high the pore size increases to<br>
allow vapor to pass through.<br>
Fuel-Vapor Equilibration:<br>
It is desirable in a direct oxidation fuel cell system of the non-stack type in<br>
which neighboring cells in the system have a common wall or where their fuel<br>
tanks have a common wall, to equilibrate the concentration of the volatile fuel in<br>
the system.<br>
The following arrangement can be used for methanol concentration<br>
equilibration.<br>
The fuel tanks (or the anode compartment of the cells) are built adjacent to<br>
each other with a common wall (tandem or side by side configuration). This<br>
common wall, above the level of the liquid has one or more apertures that are<br>
preferably covered by a porous hydrophobic nonconductive film.<br>
The film is made of insulating material and is permeable only to fuel and<br>
water vapors, but not to the aqueous solution in order to assist in reaching<br>
equilibrium of the vapor phase above the liquid.<br>
This acts to equilibrate the concentration of the methanol (or other volatile<br>
fuel) in the fuel tanks or in the anode compartments of adjacent cells. Using this<br>
concentration equilibration device, it is possible to use a manifold to feed water and<br>
fuel into multi cell DOFC system, there being no need to have an individual supply<br>
line to each one of the cells.<br>
Liquid Level Detector Utilizing an Electrodes' Arrangement:<br>
When a DOFC is used to power an appliance whose orientation is not fixed,<br>
it is desirable to detect the liquid (e.g., water, fuel, fuel solution or acid) level<br>
independently of the orientation of the appliance. When using a cell phone or other<br>
portable device, its orientation undergoes frequent change, and the phone may be<br>
used in all positions including upside down. As previously noted, when the liquid<br>
level falls below a certain level, there is then a need to feed the liquid into the<br>
anode compartment. Or when it goes higher than a certain level, there is a need to<br>
activate a blower. Therefore, there is a need for a liquid level detector, which<br>
detects the liquid level, and preferably independent of the liquid container<br>
orientation in space. Such a detector is provided by the present invention, and is<br>
characterized by having an electrodes' arrangement, preferably including at least<br>
four electrodes. The electrodes are arranged in a spaced-apart relationship in the<br>
container so as to be in contact with the inside space of the container (tank), such<br>
that they are capable of detecting the existence/absence of liquid inside the tank in<br>
different planes (levels) in the tank.<br>
As exemplified of Fig. 8, where the liquid containing tank in the form of a<br>
six-sided closed structure (box) is used, the electrodes' arrangement includes four<br>
electrodes E1-E4 arranged such that each one of the electrodes is located closer to a<br>
different comer of the box, and thus six possible voltage differences allow<br>
detection of the existence or absence of liquid at six different levels, respectively.<br>
Each two electrodes are located on a line inclined to any of the sides of the box. In<br>
this specific example, the location of each of the electrodes is defined in the<br>
following manner (shown in the figure for one electrode E3 only). The electrode is<br>
spaced from the respective corner C3 the distances a and c, wherein the distances a<br>
and c are chosen to satisfy the relations that (a/(a+b) varies between 0.1 and 0.4,<br>
and c=0.1 to 0.5z, wherein (a+b) and z are the sizes of the respective sides of the<br>
box, as shown in the figure. The resistance of a medium at levels defined by each<br>
electrodes' pair is measured from time to time or continuously, and when a<br>
resistance change (from a certain reference value) at one or more levels is detected,<br>
this is indicative of that the liquid level is low. If the liquid level must be kept<br>
below a predetermined value, at least one pair of electrodes must show a high<br>
resistance defined by a certain preset threshold value.<br>
Reduced Exposure to RF when using Cell Phone:<br>
Exposure to radiation, whether radiant energy from a radioactive, X-rays or<br>
microwave source may have serious consequences. Repeated exposure to such<br>
radiation has a cumulative effect and may induce cancer. Of concern, therefore, is a<br>
cell phone from whose antenna is radiated microwave energy, the antenna being<br>
adjacent the head of the phone user. To minimize the adverse effect of such<br>
microwave radiation, the cell phone is powered by a DOFC in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
By placing the DOFC and its fuel and water tanks on the phone cell side<br>
close to the head, this leads to a significant decrease in harmful exposure, for the<br>
microwave energy is then at least partly absorbed by the water and fuel in the<br>
DOFC.<br>
Example 1<br>
A fuel cell housing was fabricated from synthetic graphite plates (from<br>
Globetech Inc.), in which parallel flow field was engraved. The anode was<br>
prepared using Pt-Ru ink that was spread over an unteflonated Toray paper. The<br>
ink composition was 94.5wt% Pt-Ru powder (Johnson Matthey), 2.5wt% XC-72<br>
carbon powder, 1.5% PVDF and 1.5% SiO2. Ethylene glycol was added to 50%<br>
in volume. A PCM was hot pressed at 100Â°C for 60sec at 24kg/cm2, to final<br>
thickness of 120Âµm, and was immersed in water. The cathode ink was prepared<br>
by mixing 73wt% of Pt powder, 10% of XC-72 carbon powder and 17% of<br>
Nafion solution, with 50-v/v% ethylene glycole in a ball-mill for 65 minutes.<br>
MEA preparation: a 100Âµm. thick teflon gasket was placed on<br>
stainless-steel plate. The anode was immersed in water; the excess water was<br>
wiped off and the anode was fixed in a window in the gasket, of the appropriate<br>
dimension (20mm*25mm). The PCM was placed over the anode (after wiping the<br>
excess water of it). Another identical Teflon gasket was placed on the PCM,<br>
aligned with the first one, and was fixed to the stainless-steel plate with adhesive<br>
tape. The cathodic catalyst ink was applied on the membrane via the gasket<br>
window to achieve a thick hydrophobic catalyst layer that can serve as a liquid<br>
water blocking layer. A piece of 20 wt% waterproof Toray paper was cut to the<br>
window dimension and put over the wet cathodic catalytic layer which was free<br>
of holes or cracks larger than 0.5 Âµm. Alternatively, the cathodic ink was spread<br>
over 20% waterproof Toray paper with an embedded liquid-water leak-proof<br>
layer (as described before). This leak-proof layer was free of holes or cracks<br>
larger than 0.5Âµm. A second stainless-steel plate was placed over the second<br>
gasket. The assembly was pressed for 120 seconds at 100Â°C at pressure<br>
0.5-24kg/cm2, then the MEA was immersed in water for 60 seconds and pressed<br>
again for 120 seconds. The MEA was left to cool to room temperature under low<br>
load (
between the Toray paper and the Teflon gasket on the cathodic side of the MEA<br>
to prevent liquid water leaks. The MEA was then immersed in water until<br>
assembling in the complete cell.<br>
A solution of 1M methanol and 3M sulfuric acid was circulated in the<br>
5cm" cell while it was discharged at constant current of 150mA/cm2. Oxygen<br>
was circulated through the cathode. At the oxygen outlet, a U-shaped glass tube<br>
containing Dryerite (anhydrous CaSO4) was attached, in order to trap the water<br>
emerging out of the cell with the gas stream. The cell was operated at 60Â°C or at<br>
80Â°C and at ambient pressure to 3Atm at flow rates from 7 to 240scc/min.<br>
W-factor was defined as the ratio between moles of water exit the cathode outlet<br>
(collected at the glass tube) to moles of methanol consumed in the cell reaction.<br>
The optimal value of W at water-balanced condition is 2. H is the ratio between<br>
moles of water crossing the membrane to moles of protons produced in the<br>
anodic reaction - the optimal value at water-balanced conditions being zero. The<br>
W and H values (corrected for crossover current) are summarized in the<br>
following Table 1:<br>
It can be seen that W increases with the oxygen flow rate as expected.<br>
However, at low flow rates W is lower than 2, i.e. H has a negative value. It<br>
means that under these conditions, water flows back from the cathode through the<br>
PCM to the anode. It is clear that by controlling the flow rate of oxygen it is<br>
possible to affect W and H. so a flow rate where W=2 and H=0 can be found and<br>
used to wok under water-balanced conditions. By measuring the water level in<br>
the anode compartment or in the fuel tank, a water deficiency or excess is<br>
determined and the speed of the air blower (or other means) can be controlled to<br>
remove water as necessary. This way the weight and volume of water tank will<br>
be saved, leading to a smaller and lighter fuel cell.<br>
Fig. 9 presents the experimental results of the fuel cell of the invention in<br>
comparison with those of Gottesfeld et al. from Los Alamos National Laboratory<br>
(LANL) at similar conditions (Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 148 (1)<br>
A87, 2001).<br>
Example 2<br>
A fuel cell was built in the same way as in the previous example on the<br>
basis of Nafion membrane.   The anode composition was 85% Pt-Ru powder and<br>
15% Nafion.  The cathode ink was prepared the same way as in Example 1.<br>
The MEA was prepared in the same way as described in the former example and<br>
was hot pressed at 130Â°C.<br>
A 1M methanol solution was circulated through the 5 cm" cell that was<br>
operated at 60Â°C , pressure of 3Atm and flow rates from 7 to 240scc/min. Water<br>
was collected at the oxygen outlet (as described) and W-factor and H were<br>
calculated. The H values obtained were higher than the values obtained with a<br>
PCM-based cell, but lower than those described in Fig 9 for LANL Nafion-based<br>
cell (S. Gottesfeld et al., Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 148 (1) A87,<br>
2001).<br>
