COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
A VISCOUS LAUNDRY TREATMENT PRODUCT AND PACKAGING THEREFOR<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and Having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
A VISCOUS LAONDRY PRODUCT AND PACKAGIMG THEREFOR<br>
The present invention concerns a viscous laundry product and packaging therefor. 5<br>
An objective is to provide an improved pretreatment device for the precise pretreatment of laundry stains.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a 10  packaged laundry product comprising a flowable laundry composition contained in a package, wherein<br>
(i) the flowable laundry composition has a viscosity of at least at least 100 Pa.s.  preferably at least 500 Pa.s, when in rest or up to a shear stress of 10 Pa and comprising at least one 15  surfactant and at least one enzyme; and<br>
(i) the package comprises a compressible container in which the flowable laundry composition is stored and a dispensing device which incorporates a fabric pretreatment device and is located at the base of the compressable container and is enclosed by a dosing 2 0  closure device providing a supportive base of the package.<br>
The advantage of the above arrangement is that it offers greater control in applying a high viscosity composition vis-a-vis stained areas.  Dispensing controlled amounts of high viscosity fluids 2 5  from hand-held products can be difficult ergonomically and many users resort to applying an impact force to the device (banging the base, or slapping the side) which interferes with accurate dosing and often results in over-dosing, spillage etc.<br>
30  The arrangement of invention, as a consequence of the<br>
dispensing/pretreatment part being positioned at the base of the reservoir, means the user does not need to invert the package to dose/pretreat or wait until the viscous fluid flows from the base to the top (where dispensing/pretreatment devices are normally<br>
 <br>
located). with the present invention gravity maintains the pretreatment device loaded with the composition. The dispensing device need not involve complicated and expensive seal/valves as the dosing closure encloses the pretreatment device and provides 5  the base: this affords the advantage that any drips of composition falling from the pretreatment device after use, are collected in the supportive base which can then be placed directly in the washing machine/receptacle which minimises waste.<br>
10  The dispensing device may comprise a channel or duct providing fluid coMmunication between the reservoir and pretreater.<br>
The pretreater may comprise a device allowing mechanical cleaning, such as a body with multiple projections. The projections may be<br>
15  flexible so that they move during cleaning providing a light<br>
cleaning action.  Alternatively some or all of the projections may be semi-rigid or rigid so as to provide a harsher mechanical cleaning action. The projections may be thin e.g. bristles to provide a brush-like device, or thicker so as to provide finger<br>
20  like projections.<br>
The package may have a curved top to deter users from storing the bottle top-down, in this way the package is more likely to be stored in a pretreater - loading position i.e. with the flowable 25  laundry composition accumulated by gravity in the base of the package.<br>
In one embodiment the pretreater comprises a generally hemispherical body with multiple projections extending radially 30  therefrom.<br>
The composition is preferably a shear thinning gel-type composition. The viscosity under shear stress may be less than 300 Pa.s, preferably less than 100 Pa.s and more preferably less than<br>
 <br>
5 Pa.s, even more preferably it is at most 1 Pa.s and most preferably it is at most 0.5 Pa.s.<br>
Shear thinning compositions may comprise a polymer gum, e.g. 5  Xanthan gum or other gum capable of forming stable continuous gum networks which can suspend particles.<br>
Other external structurants e.g. hydrogenated castor oil, micro crystalline cellulose may be used.<br>
10<br>
Another method useful is to change a non-gelled formulation so as to form an internal structure therein where the structure gives the desired properties to the thus-formed gel-type detergent.  The composition may comprise a soap or fatty acid in combination with<br>
15  sodium sulphate and one or more surfactants may be used to form'a gelled structure by the formation of lamellar phases<br>
The composition may comprise a lamellar phase dispersions from a micellar surfactant systems, and additionally a structurant for 20  establishing the lamellar phase, whereby said structurant may be a fatty alcohol.<br>
The composition of invention contains one or more surfactants and/or optionally other ingredients such that the composition is<br>
25  fully functional as a laundry cleaning and/or care composition. A composition of the invention may be provided in solid or liquid form. If in a solid forra, the composition may be rehydrated and/or dissolved in a solvent, including water, before use. The composition may provided in a concentrated form to be diluted or<br>
30      may be a ready-to-use (in-use) composition.<br>
The present invention is suitable for use in industrial or domestic fabric wash compositions.  The present invention can also<br>
 <br>
be applied to industrial or domestic non-detergent based fabric care compositions.<br>

The method of the invention may be carried out in the presence of phospholipase classified as EC 3.1.1.4 and/or EC 3.1.1.32.  As used herein, the term phospholipase is an enzyme which has<br>
10  activity towards phospholipids.  Phospholipids, such as lecithin or phosphatidylcholine, consist of glycerol esterified with two fatty acids in an outer (sn-1) and the middle (sn-2) positions and esterified with phosphoric acid in the third position; the phosphoric acid, in turn, may be esterified to an amino-aicohol.<br>
15  Phospholipases are enzymes which participate in the hydrolysis of phospholipids.  Several types of phospholipase activity can be distinguished, including phospholipases A1 and A2 which hydrolyze one fatty acyl group (in the sn-1 and sn-2 position, respectively) to form lysophospholipid; and lysophospholipase (or phospholipase<br>
20  B) which can hydrolyze the remaining fatty acyl group in lysophospholipid.  Phospholipase C and phospholipase D (phosphodiesterases) release diacyi glycerol or phosphatidic acid respectively.<br>
25  The terra phospholipase includes enzymes with phospholipase activity, e.g., phospholipase A (A1 or A2), phospholipase B activity, phospholipase C activity or phospholipase D activity. The term "phospholipase A" used herein in connection with an enzyme of the invention is intended to cover an enzyme with<br>
30  Phospholipase A1 and/or Phospholipase A2 activity.  The<br>
phospholipase activity may be provided by enzymes having other activities as well, such as, e.g., a lipase with phospholipase activity.  The phospholipase activity may, e.g., be from a lipase with phospholipase side activity.  In other embodiments of the<br>
 <br>
invention the phospholipase enzyme activity is provided by an enzyme having essentially only phospholipase activity and wherein the phospholipase enzyme activity is not a side activity.<br>
5  The phospholipase may be of any origin, e.g., of animal origin (such as, e.g., mammalian),   e.g.   from pancreas (e.g., bovine or porcine pancreas), or snake venom or bee venom.  Preferably the phospholipase may be of microbial origin, e.g., from filamentous fungi, yeast or bacteria, such as the genus or species 10  Aspergillus, e.g., A. niger; Dictyostelium, e.g., D. discoideum;<br>
Mucor, e.g. M, javanicus, M. mucedo, M. subtilissimus; Neurospora, e.g. N. crassa; Rhizomuucor, e.g., R. pusillus; Rhizopus, e.g. R. arrhizus, R. japonicus, R. stolonifer; Sclerotinia, e.g., S. libertiana; Trichophyton, e.g. T. rubrum; Whetzelinia, e.g., W.<br>
15  sclerotiorum; Bacillus, e.g., B. megaterium, B. subtilis;<br>
Citrobacter, e.g., C. freundii; Enterobacter, e.g., E. aerogenes, E. cloacae Edwardsiella, E. tarda; Erwinia, e.g., E. herbicola; Escherichia, e.g., E. coli; Klebsiella, e.g., K. pneumoniae; Proteus, e.g., P. vulgaris; Providencia, e.g., P. stuartii;<br>

Thus, the phospholipase may be fungal, e.g., from the class Pyrenomycetes, such as the genus Fusarium, such as a strain of F. culmoriom, F.<br>
25  heterosporum, F. solani, or a strain of F. oxysporum.  The<br>
phospholipase may also be from a filamentous fungus strain ■within the genus Aspergillus, such as a strain of Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus oryzae.<br>
30<br>
Preferred phospholipases are derived from a strain of Humicola, especially Humicola lanuginosa.  The phospholipase may be a variant, such as one of the variants disclosed in WO 00/32758, which are hereby incorporated by reference.  Preferred<br>
 <br>
phospholipase variants include variants listed, in Example 5 of WO 00/32758, which is hereby specifically incorporated by reference. In another preferred embodiment the phospholipase is one described in WO 04/111216, especially the variants listed in the table in 5  Example 1.<br>

Various non-limiting embodiments of the invention will now be more 30  particularly described with reference to the following figure in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a packaged laundry product according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
 <br>
Referring to the drawing, a packaged laundry product 1 is shown. The product 1 comprises a flowable laundry composition 3 contained in a package 5, the high viscosity laundry composition 3 according to Example A or B detailed below. 5<br>
The package comprises a compressible container, in this example a plastic bottle 7 storing the flowable, high viscosity laundry gel 3 and a dispensing device 9 incorporating a fabric pretreatment device 11. The dispensing device 9 is located at the base 13 of 10  the container 7 and is enclosed by a dosing closure device 13.<br>
The closure 13 comprises the supportive base 13 of the package 5.<br>
The bottle 7 and dispensing device 9 (incorporating pretreater 11) are attached to each other by threaded connection. The closure 13 15 is attached to the bottle also by a threaded connection. (Threaded connections not shown). In a separate embodiment the closure 13 is connected to the bottle 7 using a snap-on connection, which negates the requirement to rotate the bottle/closure to open shut.<br>
20  The bottle 7 is fabricated frora a flexible plastic material comprising polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The top 21 of the bottle is shown flat but in other embodiments it may be curved as shown in dotted line 22 to discourage storage 25  top-down.<br>
The closure 13 includes an  enlarged (with respect   to  at least the neck region of the bottle) flat, generally planar bottom surface 15. By providing an enlarged flat top surface 15, the surface 30  allows the closure 13 to function as a supportive base 13 with the bottle 7 in an inverted position thereby allowing the high viscosity gel 3 to accumulate (under gravity) during storage at the dispensing device 9.<br>
 <br>
In addition, the  closure 13  includes a reservoir portion 17 in which the pretreater 11 is enclosed 26.  The closure is taped outwardly toward the surface 15 to provide a stable base. The area of the surface 15 is greater than that of the top 21 of the 5  device.<br>
The dispensing device 9 comprises an orifice through which dispensing may occur. The orifice includes a valve 21 in fluid communication via duct 23. The valve 21 cortiprlses a memirane 10  extending across an orifice 25 in the dispensing part 9.<br>
In one embodiment, the membrane has an arcuate portion (not shown) directed toward the container 7. The arcuate portion of the membrane is provided with a intersecting slits to define a<br>
15  plurality of generally triangular leaves.  When contents of the container are pressurized for dispensing, the triangular leaves bend toward the open end of the orifice 25 allowing product to pass through the orifice 25.  When the dispensing pressure is released, the triangular leaves spring back to their original<br>
20  position and operate to block passage of product through the<br>
orifice 25. The leaves of the valve are sufficiently resilient ' that they do not bend open unless the applied pressure exceeds the hydraulic static head pressure generated by a full of condiment. In use, the fluid is pressurised to flow past and partially<br>
25  collect on the pretreater part 11 ready for cleaning.<br>
Any of the fluid which remains on the pretreater part 11, can drips from the pretreater 11 during storage and is collected in the reservoir portion 17 for use in the next wash. This reduces waste of product.<br>

 <br>
Exemplary Laundry Formulation A.<br>
The following gel laundry detergent compositions were prepared, of<br>
which composition A is according to the invention 5<br>
Component:	Wt %<br>
Propylene glycol	8,0<br>
sodium citrate	3.9<br>
Borax	3. 0<br>

Coconut fatty acid	1.5<br>
Nonionic surfactant	11.1<br>

20  Water	balance to 100<br>
wherein:<br>
Borax : Sodium tetraborate (lOaq)<br>
nonionic surfactant: ethoxylated alcohol with on average 9 25  ethylene oxide groups.<br>
The gel detergent composition exemplified by composition A was found to be shear thinning and stable. Furthermore, typical detergent particles of density between 0.8 and 0.9 g/cm3 and 30  having a diameter up to 5000 microns could be stable suspended in this composition for more than 2 weeks without any observable net movement of the particles.<br>
 <br>

	20s-l	lOOs-l	Fa. s	Fa	at 1 Hz<br>
A	2,11	0.61	3.00E+05	15	0,04<br>
For obtaining the values shown in the above table,   all rheological measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a Carrimed CSL 1OO 5  rheometer with a cone and plate geometry specially roughed to prevent slip.<br>
Viscosity was measured at varying shear rates from very low shear up to a shear regime in excess of 100 s1. Two situations are<br>
10  shown: the viscosity measured at relatively low shear (20 s1) and that measured at much higher shear (100 s1 ). It can be seen that the viscosity of composition A at high shear is much lower than that obtained at low shear, whereas composition B shows almost equal viscosity's for high and low shear. In other words<br>
15  composition A is clearly shear thinning, whereas composition B is not.<br>
In addition, the critical stress is   shown. This parameter represents the stress at which the material leaves the upper<br>
2 0  Newtonian plateau and thins under increasing shear.<br>
Also, "Eta 0"-values are shown, referring to the viscosity calculated for zero shear from creep flow measurements. Finally, "Tan delta" values are shown, referring to the ratio of loss over storage moduli (G'/G') and reflecting the dominance of<br>
25  viscous over elastic properties such that materials giving very<br>
low "Tan delta"-values (tending to zero, such as composition A in the above table), will be much more elastic than those giving higher "Tan delta" values (tending to 90).<br>
 <br>
Exemplary Laundry Formulation B<br>
The following gel laundry detergent compositions were prepared of which composition C is according to the invention and composition 5  D is a comparative composition according to the prior art:<br>

10  Borax	2.3<br>
NaOH (50%)	0.43<br>

Borax : Sodium tetraborate (1Oaq) 25  nonionic surfactant: ethoxylated alcohol with on average 9 ethylene oxide groups<br>
Sodium alcohol EO sulphate: ethoxylated alcohol sulphate with on average 3 ethylene oxide groups. 30<br>
Composition B was is a stabler transparent, pourable shear thinning liquid, capable of stable suspending typical detergent particles having a density of between 0.8 and 0.9 g/cm3 and a<br>
 <br>
diameter of up to 5000 microns, for more than 2 weeks without any observable net movement of the particles,<br>
Critical rheological parameters for the two compositions are shown 5  below.<br>
