				<td>Therapeutic Vaccine<br>
The present invention Is related to methods and compositions for the therapeutic and diagnostic use in the treatment of diseases and disorders which are caused by or associated with amyloid or amyloid-like proteins including amyloidosis, a group of disorders and abnonmalities associated with amyloid protein such as Alzheimer's Disease.<br>
Amyloidosis is not a single disease entity but rather a diverse group of progressive disease processes characterized by extracellular tissue deposits of a waxy, starch-like protein called amyloid, which accumulates in one or more organs or body systems. As the amyloid deposits build up, they begin to interfere with the normal function of the organ or body system. There are at least 15 different types of amyloidosis. The major forms are primary amyloidosis without known antecedent, secondary amyloidosis following some other condition, and hereditary amyloidosis.<br>
Secondary amyloidosis occurs in people who have a chronic infection or inflammatory disease, such as tuberculosis, a bacterial infection called familial Mediterranean fever, bone infections (osteomyelitis), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation of the small intestine (granulomatous ileitis), Hodgkin's disease, and leprosy.<br>
Amyloid deposits typically contain three components. Amyloid protein fibrils, which account for about 90% of the amyloid material, comprise one of several different types of proteins. These proteins are capable of folding into so-called "beta-pleated" sheet fibrils, a unique protein configuration which exhibits binding sites for Congo red resulting in the unique staining properties of the amyloid protein. In addition, amyloid deposits are closely associated with the amyloid P (pentagonal) component (AP), a glycoprotein related to normal serum amyloid P (SAP), and with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG), complex carbohydrates of connective tissue.<br>
Many diseases of aging are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins and are characterized, in part, by the buildup of extracellular deposits of amyloid or amyloid-like material that contribute to the pathogenesis, as well as the progression of the disease. These diseases include, but are not limited to, neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), including diseases or conditions characterized by a loss of cognitive memory capacity such as, for example, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Lewry body dementia, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex. Other diseases which are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis; Creutzfeld Jacob disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral sclerosis). Adult Onset Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and others, including macular degeneration.<br>
Although pathogenesis of these diseases may be diverse, their characteristic deposits often contain many shared molecular constituents. To a significant degree, this may be   . attributable to the local activation of pro-inflammatory pathways thereby leading to the concurrent deposition of activated complement components, acute phase reactants, Immune modulators, and other inflammatory mediators (McGeer et al., 1994).<br>
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurological disorder primarily thought to be caused by amyloid plaques, an accumulation of abnormal deposit of proteins in the brain. The most frequent type of amyloid found in the brain of affected individuals is composed primarily of Ap fibrils. Scientific evidence demonstrates that an increase in the production and accumulation of beta-amyloid protein in plaques leads to nerve cell death, which contributes to the development and progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Loss of nerve cells in strategic brain areas, in turn, causes reduction in the neurotransmitters and impairment of memory. The proteins principally responsible for the plaque build up include amyloid precursor protein (APP) and two presenilins (presenilin I and presenilin II). Sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is constitutivety expressed and catabolized in most cells, by the enzymes p and y secretase leads to the release of an 39 to 43 amino acid Ap peptide. The degradation of APPs likely increases their propensity to aggregate in plaques. It is especially the Ap(1-42) fragment that has a high propensity of building aggregates due to two very hydrophobic amino acid residues at its C-terminus. The Ap(1-42) fragment is therefore believed to be mainly involved and responsible for the initiation of neutritic plaque formation in Alzheimer's Disease and to have, therefore, a high pathological potential. There is therefore a need for specific antibodies that can target and diffuse amyloid plaque formation.<br>
The symptonr^s of Alzheimer's Disease manifest slowly and the first symptom may only be mild forgetfulness, In this stage, Individuals may forget recent events, activities, the names of familiar people or things and may not be able to solve simple math problems.<br>
As the disease progresses, symptoms are more easily noticed and become serious enough to cause people with Alzheimer's Disease or their family members to seek medical help. Mid-stage symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease include forgetting how to do simple tasks such as grooming, and problems develop with speaking, understanding, reading, or writing. Later stage Alzheimer's Disease patients may become anxious or aggressive, ma"y wander away from hom&amp;and ultimately need total care. Presently, the only definite way to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease is to identify plaques and tangles in brain tissue in an autopsy after death of the individual. Therefore, doctors can only make a diagnosis of "possible" or "probable" Alzheimer's Disease while the person is still alive. Using current methods, physicians can diagnose Alzheimer's Disease correctly up to 90 percent of the time using several tools to diagnose "probable" Alzheimer's Disease. Physicians ask questions about the person's general health, past medical problems, and the history of any difficulties the person has carrying out daily activities. Behavioral tests of memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language provide information on cognitive degeneration and medical tests-such as tests of blood, urine, or spinal fluid, and brain scans can provide some further information.<br>
The management of Alzheimer's Disease consists of medication-based and non-medication based treatments. Treatments aimed at changing the underlying course of the disease (delaying or reversing the progression) have so far been largely unsuccessful. Medicines that restore the deficit (defect), or malfunctioning, in the chemical messengers of the nerve cells (neurotransmitters), such as the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEls), have been shown to improve symptoms. Medications are also available to address the psychiatric manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease.<br>
 Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as Tacrine and Rrvastgmine, are currently the only class of agents that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. These agents are medicines that restore the defect, or malfunctioning, in the chemical neurotransmission in the brain. ChEls impede the enzymatic degradation of neurotransmitters thereby increasing the amount of chemical messengers available to transmit the nerve signals in the brain.<br>
For some people in the early and middle stages of the disease, the drugs tacrine (COGNEX®, Morris Plains, NJ), donepezil (ARICEPT*, Tokyo, JP). rivastigmine (EXELON®, East Hanover, NJ), or galantamine (REMINYL®, New Brunswick, NJ) may help prevent some symptoms from becoming worse for a limited time. Another drug, -.memantine (NAMENDA®, New York, NY), has been approved for tceatnnsnt of moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease. Also, some medicines may help control behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease such as sleeplessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, and depression. Treating these symptoms often makes patients more comfortable and makes their care easier for caregivers. Unfortunately, despite significant treatment advances showing that this class of agents is consistently better than a placebo, the disease continues to progress, and the average effect on mental functioning has only been modest. ChEls also have side effects that include gastrointestinal dysfunction, liver toxicity and weight loss.<br>
Advances in the understanding of the brain abnormalities that occur in Alzheimer's Disease are hoped to provide the framework for new targets of treatment that are more focused on altering the course and development of the disease. Many compounds, including anti-inflammatory agents, are being actively investigated. Clinical trials using specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors {COX-2), such as rofecoxib and celecoxib, are also undenway.<br>
Other diseases that are based on or associated with the accumulation and deposit of amyloid-like protein are mild cognitive impalmnent, Lewy body dementia (LBD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), inclusion-body myositis (IBM) and macular degeneration, in particular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).<br>
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a general temi most commonly defined as a subtle but measurable memory disorder A person with MCI experiences memory problems greater than nomially expected with aging, but does not stiow other symptoms of dementia, such as impaired judgment or reasoning. MCI is a condition that frequently reflects a preclinical stage of AD.<br>
The deposition of 3-amyloid within the entorhinal cortex (EC) is believed to play a key role in the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly. This is in line with the observation that the CSF-A Ap(1-42) tevels decline significantly once AD becomes clinically overt. In contrast to CSF- Ap(1-42) CSF-tau levels are significantly increased in the MCI stage, and these values continue to be elevated thereafter, indicating that increased levels of CSF-tau-may help in detecting MCI subjects who are predicted to develop AD.<br>
Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that can occur in persons older than 65 years of age, which typically causes symptoms of cognitive (thinking) impairment and abnormal behavioural changes. Symptoms can include cognitive impairment, neurological signs, sleep disorder, and autonomic failure. Cognitive impairment is the presenting feature of LBD in most cases. Patients have recurrent episodes of confusion that progressively worsen. The fluctuation in cognitWe ability is often associated with shifting degrees of attention and alertness. Cognitive impairment and fluctuations of thinking may vary over minutes, hours, or days.<br>
Lewy bodies are formed from phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated neurofilament proteins; they contain the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein as well as ubiquitin, which is involved in the elimination of damaged or abnormal proteins. In addition to Lewy Bodies, Lewy neurites, which are inclusion bodies in the cell processes of the nerve cells, may also be present. Amyloid plaques may fomi in the brains of patients afflicted with DLB, however they tend to be fewer in number than seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Neurofibrillary tangles, the other micropathological hallmark of AD, are not a main characteristic of DLB but are frequently present in addition to amyloid plaques.<br>
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. In some ALS patients, dementia or aphasia may be present (ALS-D). The dementia is most commonly a frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and many of these cases have ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions in neurons of the dentate gyrus and superficial layers of the frontal and temporal lobes.<br>
Inclusion-body myositis (IBM) is a crippling disease usually found in people over age 50, in which muscle fibers develop inflammation and begin to atrophy—but in which the brain is spared and patients retain their full intellect. Two enzymes involved in the production of amyloid-B protein were found to be increased inside the muscle cells of patients with this most common, progressive muscle disease of older people. In which amyloid-ll is also increased.<br>
Another disease that is based on or associated with the accumulation and deposit of amyloid-like protein is macular degeneration.<br>
Macular degeneration is a common eye disease that causes deterioration of the macula, which is the central area of the retina (the paper-thin tissue at the back of the eye where light-sensitive cells send visual signals to the brain). Sharp, clear, 'straight ahead' vision is processed by the macula. Damage to the macula results in the development of blind spots and blurred or distorted vision. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Is a major cause of visual impaiment in the United States and for people over age 65 it is the leading cause of legal blindness among Caucasians. Approximately 1.8 million Americans age 40 and older have advanced AMD, and another 7.3 million people with intermediate AMD are at substantial risk for vision loss. The government estimates that by 2020 there will be 2.9 miliion people with advanced AMD. Victims of AMD are often surprised and fnjstrated to find out how little is known about the causes and treatment of this blinding condition.<br>
There are two forms of macular degeneration: dry macular degeneration and wet macular degeneration. The dry forni, in which the cells of the macula slowly begin to break down, is diagnosed in 85 percent of macular degeneration cases. Both eyes are usually affected by dry AMD, although one eye can lose vision while the other eye remains unaffected, Drusen, which are yellow deposits under the retina, are common early signs of dry AMD. The risk of developing advanced dry AMD or wet AMD increases as the number or size of the drusen increases. It is possible for dry AMD to advance and cause loss of vision without turning Into the wet fonn of the disease; however, it Is also possible for early-stage dry AMD to suddenly change into the wet form.<br>
The wet form, although it only accounts for 15 percent of the cases, results in 90 percent of the blindness, and is considered advanced AMD (there is no early or intermediate stage of wet AMD). Wet AMD is always preceded by the dry form of the disease. As the dry form worsens, some people begin to have abnormal blood vessels growing behind the macula. These vessels are very fragile and will leak fluid and blood (hence 'wet' macular degeneration), causing rapid damage to the macula.      ^^<br>
The dry form of AMD will initially often cause slightly blurred vision. The center of vision in particular may then become blurred and this region grows larger as the disease progresses. No symptoms may be noticed if only one eye is affected. In wet AMD, straight lines may appear wavy and central vision loss can occur rapidly.<br>
Diagnosis of macular degeneration typically involves a dilated eye exam, visual acuity test, and a viewing of the back of the eye using a procedure called fundoscopy to help diagnose AMD, and—if wet AMD Is suspected—fluorescein angiography may also be performed. If dry AMD reaches the advanced stages, there is no current treatment to prevent vision loss. However, a specific high dose formula of antioxidants and zinc may delay or prevent intennediate AMD from progressing to the advanced stage. Macugen® (pegaptanib sodium injection), laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy can control the abnormal blood vessel growth and bleeding in the macula, which Is helpful for some people who have wet AMD; however, vision that is already lost will not be restored by these techniques. If vision is already lost, low vision aids exist that can help improve the quality of life.<br>
One of the earliest signs of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the accumulation of extracellular deposits known as dmsen between the basal lamina of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane (BM). Recent studies conducted by Anderson et al. have confirmed that drusen contains amyloid beta, (Experimental Eye Research 78 (2004) 243-256).<br>
Ongoing research continues with studies exploring environmental, genetic, and dietary factors that may contribute to AMD. New treatment strategies are also being explored, including retinal cell transplants, drugs that will prevent or slow down the progress of the disease, radiation therapy, gene therapies, a computer chip implanted in the retina that may help stimulate vision and agents that will prevent the growth of new blood vessels under the macula.<br>
What is needed therefore, are effective therapeutic vaccine compositions and methods for addressing the complications associated with amyloidosis, a group of diseases and- -disorders associated with amyloid plaque formation including secondary amyloidosis and age-related amyloidosis including, but not limited to, neurological disordere such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), including diseases or conditions characterized by a loss of cognitive memory capacity such as, for example, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Lewy body dementia, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex; as well as other diseases which are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis; Creutzfeld Jacob disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral sclerosis).

These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiment and the appended claims.<br>
The terms "polypeptids", "peptide", and "protein", as used herein, are interchangeable and are defined to mean a biomolecule composed of amino acids linked by a peptide bond.<br>
The term "peptides," are chains of amino acids (typically L-amino acids) whose alpha carbons are linked through peptide bonds formed by a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of the alpha carbon of one amino acid and the amino group of the alpha carbon of another amino acid. The terminal amino acid at one end of the chain (i.e., the amino terminal) has a free amino group, while the terminal amino acid at the other end of the chain (I.e., the carboxy terminal) has a free carboxyl group. As such, the term "amino terminus" {abbreviated N-temiinus) refers to the free alpha-amino group on the amino acid at the amino terminal of the peptide, or to the alpha-amino group (imino group when participating in a peptide bond) of an amino acid at any other location within the peptide. Similarly, the term "carboxy terminus" (abbreviated C-terminus) refers to the free carboxyl group on the amino actd at the carboxy terminus of a peptide, or to the carboxyl group of an amino acid at any other location within the peptide.<br>
Typically, the amino acids making up a peptide are numbered in order, starting at the amino temninal and increasing in the direction toward the carboxy terminal of the peptide. Thus, when one amino acid is said to 'Yodow" another, that amino acid is positioned closer to the carboxy temiinal of the peptide than the preceding amino acid.<br>
The term "residue" is used herein to refer to an amino acid that is incorporated into a peptide by an amide bond. As such, the amino acid may be a naturally occurring amino acid or, unless otherwise limited, may encompass known analogs of natural amino acids that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids (i.e., amino acid mimefics). Moreover, an amide bond mimetic includes peptide backbone modifications well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The phrase "consisting essentially of is used herein to exclude any elements that would substantially alter the essential properties of the peptides to which the phrase refers. Thus, the description of a peptide "consisting essentially of . . ," excludes any amino acid substitutions, additions, or deletions that would substantially alter the biological activity of that peptide.<br>
Furthermore, one of skill will recognize that, as mentioned above, individual substitutions, deletions or additions which alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids (typically less than 5%, more typically less than 1%) in an encoded sequence are conservatively modified variations where the alterations result in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known  in the  art.  The following  six groups each contain  amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T); 2} Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);<br>
3)	Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);<br>
4)	Arginine (R), Lysine (K);<br>
5)	Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and<br>
6)	Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W).<br>
The phrases "isolated" or "biologically pure" refer to material which is substantially or essentially free from components which normally accompany it as found in its native state. Thus, the peptides described herein do not contain materials normally associated with their in situ environment. Typically, the isolated, immunogenic peptides described . ,-. herein are at least about 80% pure, usually at least about 90%, and preferably at least about 95% as measured by band intensity on a sifver stained gel.<br>
Protein purity or homogeneity may be indicated by a number of methods well known in the art, such as pofyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a protein sample, followed by visualization upon staining. For certain purposes high resolution will be needed and HPLC or a similar means for purification utilized.<br>
When the immunogenic peptides are relatively short in length (i.e., less than about 50 amino acids), they are often synthesized using standard chemical peptide synthesis techniques.<br>
Solid phase synthesis in which the C-terminal amino acid of the sequence is attached to an insoluble support followed by sequential addition of the remaining amino acids in the sequence is a preferred method for the chemical synthesis of the immunogenic peptides described herein. Techniques for solid phase synthesis are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the immunogenic peptides described herein are synthesized using recombinant nucleic acid methodology. Generally, this involves creating a nucleic acid<br><br>
sequence that encodes the peptide, placing the nucleic acid in an expression casseue under the control of a particular promoter, expressing the peptide in a host, isolating the expressed peptide or polypeptide and, if required, renaturing the peptide. Techniques sufficient to guide one of skill through such procedures are found in the literature.<br>
Once expressed, recombinant peptides can be purified according to standard procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns, column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like. Substantially pure compositions of about 50% to 95% homogeneity are preferred, and 80% to 95% or greater homogeneity are most preferred for use as therapeutic agents.<br>
One of skill in the art will recognize that after chemical synthesis, biological expression or purification, the immunogenic peptides may possess^a conformation substantially different than the native conformations of the constituent peptides. In this case, it is often necessary to denature and reduce the antiproliferafive peptide and then to cause the peptide to re~foid into the preferred conformation. Methods of reducing and denaturing proteins and inducing re-folding are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Antigenicity of the purified protein may be confirmed, for example, by demonstrating reaction with immune serum, or with antisera produced against the protein itself.<br>
The terms "a", "an" and "the" as used herein are defined to mean "one or more" and include the plural unless the context is inappropriate.<br>
The terms "detecting" or "detected" as used herein mean using known techniques for detection of biologic molecules such as immunochemical or histological methods and refer to qualitatively or quantitatively determining the presence or concentration of the biomolecute under investigation.<br>
By "isolated" is meant a biological molecule free from at least some of the components with which it naturally occurs.<br><br>
The terms "antibody" or "antibodies" as used herein is an art recognized term and is understood to refer to molecules or active fragments of molecules that bind to known antigens, particularly to immunoglobulin molecules and to immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e molecules that contain a binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunogtobulin according to the invention can be of any type (IgG, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA and IgY) or class (lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, lgA1 and lgA2) or subclasses of immunoglobulin molecule.<br>
"Antibodies" are intended within the scope of the present invention to include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal, chimeric, single chain, bispecific, simianized, human and humanized antibodies as well as active fragments thereof. Examples of active fragments of molecules that bind to known antigens include Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, including the products of an Fab immunoglobulin expression library and epitope-binding , -. fragments of any of the antibodies and fragments mentioned above.<br>
These active fragments can be derived from an antibody of the present invention by a number of techniques. For example, purified monoclonal antibodies can be cleaved with an enzyme, such as pepsin, and subjected to HPLC gel filtration. The appropriate fraction containing Fab fragments can then be collected and concentrated by membrane filtration and the iik&amp;. For furtfier description of general techniques for the isolation of active fragments of antibodies, see for example, Khaw, B. A. et al. J. Nucl. Med. 23:1011-1019 (1982); Rousseaux et al. Methods Enzymology. 121:663-69, Academic Press, 1986.<br>

The antibodies can be of any class such as IgG, IgM, or IgA, etc or any subclass such as lgG1, lgG2a, etc and other subclasses mentioned herein above or known in the art.<br>
 Further, the antibodies can be produced by any method, such as phage display, or produced in any organism or cell line, including bacteria, insect, mammal or other type of cell or cell line which produces antibodies with desired characteristics, such as humanized antibodies. The antibodies can also be formed by combining a Fab portion and an Fc region from different species.<br>
The term "antigen" refers to an entity or fragnwnt thereof which can induce an immune response in an organism, particularly an animal, more particulariy a mammal including a human. The term includes Immunogens and regions responsible for antigenicity or antigenic detenninants.<br>
An immune response occurs when an individual produces sufficient antibodies, T-cells and other reactive immune cells against administered immunogenic compositions of the present invention to moderate or alleviate the disorder to be treated.<br>
The term "hybridoma" is art recognized and is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to refer to a cell produced by the fusion of an antibody-producing cell and an immortal cell, e.g. a multiple myeloma cell. This hybrid cell is capable of producing a continuous supply of antibody. See the definition of "monoclonal antibody" above and the Examples below for a more detailed description of the method of fusion.<br>
The tenn "carrier" as used herein means a structure in which antigenic peptide or supramolecuiar construct can be incorporated into or can be associated with, thereby presenting or exposing antigenic peptides or part of the peptide to the immune system of a human or animal. Any particle that can be suitably used in animal or human therapy<br><br>
such as, for example, a vesicle, a particle or a particulate body may be used as a carrier within the context of the present invention.<br>
The temi "carrier" further comprises methods of delivery wherein supramoiecular antigenic construct compositions comprising the antigenic peptide may be transported to desired sites by delivery mechanisms. One example of such a delivery system utilizes colloidal metals such as colloidal gold.<br>

Consequently, the specific amount administered to an individual will be determined by routine experimentation and based upon the training and experience of one skilled in the art.<br>

In still a further embodiment of the present invention a method is thus provided for the preparation of a  composition for preventing,  treating  or alleviating  the  effects of<br><br>
amyloidosis, a group of diseases and disorders associated with amyloid plaque formation including secondary amyloidosis and age-related amyloidosis including, but not limited to, neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), including diseases or conditions characterized by a loss of cognitive memory capacity such as, for example, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Lewy body dementia, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex; as welt as other diseases which are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis; Creutzfeld Jacob disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral sclerosis), Adult Onset Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and others, including macular degeneration, but particularly a disease or condition characterized by a loss of cognitive memory capacity such as, for example, mild cognitive impaimnent (MCi), comprising formulating an antibody according .to Jtip_ invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable fomn.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the present invention makes use of an antigen presentation that results in enhanced exposure and stabilization of a preferred antigen confonnation, which ultimately leads to a highly specific immune response and results in the generation of antibodies with unique properties.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides immunogenic compositions comprising a supramolecular antigenic construct comprising a 3-amyloid peptide antigen according to the invention and as described herein before representative of the N-temiinal part of the P-amyloid peptide, which antigenic peptide is modified such that it is capable of maintaining and stabilizing a defined confonnation of the antigen, particularly a conformation which is characterized by a balanced proportion of random coil, a-helical and g-sheet portions. This defined conformation leads to the induction of a strong and highly specific immune response upon introduction into an animal or a human.<br>
One way of achieving the formation and stabilization of the desired conformation of the antigenic peptide is by presenting the antigenic peptide attached to, or incorporated or reconstituted,  partially or fully, into a carrier such as, for example, a vesicle,  a<br><br>
particulate body or molecule or any other means that can suitably serve as a carrier/adjuvant for the antigenic peptide. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the antigenic peptide is attached to, or incorporated or reconstituted in the carrier through weak interactions such as, for example, van der Waal's, hydrophobic or electrostatic interaction, or a combination of two or more of said interactions, such that the peptide is presented with a specific conformation, which is maintained and stabilized by restricting said antigenic peptide in its three dimensional freedom of movement so that conformational changes are prevented or severely restricted.<br>
comprised in the antigenic peptide. This results in a presentation of the antigenic construct such that is freely accessible to the immune defense machinery of the target organism and thus capable of inducing a strong and highly specific immunogenic response upon administration to an animal or a human. The immunogenic response may be further increased by using a liposome as a carrier, which liposome may function as an adjuvant to increase or stimulate the immune response within the target animal or human to be treated with the therapeutic vaccine according to the invention. Optionally, the liposome may, in addition, contain a further adjuvant such as, for example, lipid A, alum, calcium phosphate, interleukin 1, and/or microcapsules of polysaccharides and proteins, but particularly a detoxified lipid A, such as monophosphoryl or diphosphoryl lipid A, or alum.<br>
in a specific embddiftiehT'of the invention an antigenic peptide according to the invention and described herein before, particularly an antigenic peptide the overall net charge of which is negative, is used reconstituted in a liposome, particularly a liposome the constituents of which are chosen such that the net overall charge of the liposome head group Is negative. In particular, the liposome is composed of constituents selected from the group consisting of dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline (DMPC), dimyristoyi phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DMPEA), dimyristoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (DMPG) and cholesterol and, optionally, further contains monophosphoryl lipid A or any other adjuvant that can be suitably used within the scope of the present invention such as, for example, alum, calcium phosphate, interleukin 1, and/or microcapsules of polysaccharides and proteins.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention a modified peptide antigen according to the invention and as described herein before is provided covalently bound to an anchor-type molecule which is capable of inserting into the carrier/adjuvant thereby fixing the peptide to the carrier/adjuvant and presenting it on or in close proximity to the surface of a carrier/adjuvant molecule such that electrostatic forces can become effective as described herein before.<br>
When liposomes are used as a carrier/adjuvant, the antigenic peptide construct generally has a hydrophobic tail that inserts into the liposome membrane as it is formed.<br><br>
Additionally, antigenic peptides can be modified to contain a hydrophobic tail so that it can be inserted into the liposome.<br>
The supramolecular antigenic constructs of the present invention generally comprise peptides modified to enhance antigenic effect wherein such peptides may be modified via pegylation (using polyethylene glycol or modified polyethylene glycol), or modified via other methods such by palmitic acid as described herein before, poly-amino acids (eg poly-glycine, poly-histidine), poly-saccharides (eg poiygalacturon'tc acid, polylactic acid, polyglycolide, chitin, chitosan), synthetic polymers (polyamides, polyurethanes, polyesters) or co-polymers (eg. poly(methacrylic acid) and N-(2-hydroxy) propyl methacrylamide) and the like.<br>
Palmitoylation, while providing an anchor for the peptide in the liposome bilayer, due to the relative reduced length of the Ci6:o fatty acid moiety leads to the peptide being presented exposed on or in close proximity to the liposome surface. Therefore, the cells processing the antigen will have to take up the entire liposome with the peptide. In another embodiment of the invention, PEG is used in the preparation of a supramolecular construct, wherein the free PEG terminus is covalently attached to a<br><br>
molecule of phosphatidylethanolamine (where the fatty acid can be: myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic etc. or combination thereof). This suprafr)o\ecuiar structure may be reconstituted in liposomes consisting of phospholipids and cholesterol (phosphatidytethanol amine, phosphatidyl glycerol, cholesterol in varied mo\ar ratios, Other phospholipids can be used. Lipid A Is used at a concentration of approximately 40 pg/pmole of phospholipids.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide vaccine compositions comprising supramolecular antigenic constructs comprising an antigenic peptide according to the Invention and as described herein before, w/hich peptide is modified so as to enhance the antigenic effect wherein such peptide, particularly an A^ peptide fragment from the N-terminal part of the A|3 peptide, but particularly an A^ peptide fragment consisting of amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of 1-15,. 2-15, 3-15, 1-14, 2-14, 1-13; M6(A2). 1-16{A4), 1-16(A5), 1-16(A6), 1-16{A8), 1-16(A9), 1-16{A10); 1-16(A12), 16(A13), 16(A14), 1-16(A15), 1.15(A2), 1-15(A4), 1-15(A5), 1-15(A6), 1-15{A8), 1-15(A9), 1-15(A10); 1-15(A12), 15(A13), 15(A14). an APi.i6(ii5) peptide antigen, more particularly a Api.i6(ai4) or APi.i6(ai3) peptide antigen, even more particularly a A^i.u peptide antigen, specifically a ApMg peptide antigen, but especially an Ap peptide fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1-15 as given in SEQ ID NO: 1, and 1-16(A14) as given in SEQ ID NO: 3, is modified via pegylation (using polyethylene glycol or modified polyethylene glycol), or modified via other methods such by poly-amino acids (e.g. poly-glycine, poly-histidine), poly-saccharides (e.g. polygalacturonic acid, polylactic acid, polyglycolide, chitin, chitosan), synthetic polymers (polyamides, polyurethanes, polyesters) or co-polymers (poly(methacrylic acid) and N-(2-hydroxy) propyl methacrylamide) and the like.<br>

The liposome may have a dual function in that it can be used as a carrier comprising the supramolecular construct as described herein before and, at the same time, function as<br><br>
an adjuvant to increase or stimulate the imnnune response within the target animal or human to be treated with the therapeutic vaccine according to the invention. Optionally, the liposome may, in addition, contain a further adjuvant or and immunomodulator or both such as, for example, lipid A, alum, calcium phosphate, interieukin 1. and/or microcapsules of polysaccharides and proteins, but particularly a lipid A, more particularly a detoxified lipid A, such as monophosphoryl or dlphosphoryl lipid A, or alum.<br>

 It is long known that vaccination of an animal or human host with a nomial host protein may lead to the development of auto-anflbodies directed against the host protein resulting in disorders collectively known as autoimmune disorders. A|5 and its APP precursor protein are such nornial proteins. Using these host proteins in a vaccination thus has the potential of creating undesired side-effects. There is some evidence in the literature that Ap may activate a neuroinflammatory response which may partly be caused by an overactivation of the complement system, which is already highly activated in patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or other neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
Human Ap in Its p-sheet conformation is a powerful activator of the human complement system. It strongly binds to the collagen tall of the human complement Clq. Overactivation of the complement System can result in the host's natural defense system turning around and leading to autodestructton of cells and tissues including neurons and their processes. For example, the membrane attack complex (MAC) which is part of the host's natural defense system and protects the host against invading bacteria and viruses by inserting itself into said bacteria and viruses, upon overactivation can insert itself into host cells and cause autodistmction. Overactivation may further lead to the stimulation of microglia to produce toxic compounds such as oxygen-free radicals and harmful proteases.<br>
It is thus a further object of the present invention to prevent potential side effects such as neurological complications caused by vaccinating an animal or a human suffering from an autoimmune disease with an autoantigen, which has the potential to further stimulate an already over-activated complement system. This can be achieved within the scope of the present Invention by administering an Ap peptide antigen, particularly a palmitoylated Ap peptide antigen, more particularly the palmitoylated APi.15 peptide antigen, but especially the palmitoylated Api-15 peptide antigen {ACI-24, Apvis) in combination with a complement inhibitor.<br>
It is thus another embodiment of the invention to provide a vaccine composition comprising in addition to an Ap peptide antigen, particularty the Ap peptide antigen according to the invention and described herein before; an inhibitor of the comptement system.<br>
The complement inhibitor may be a compound selected from the group consisting of soluble human complement Receptor 1, anti- human complement protein C5 such as, for example, a humanized anti C5 monoclonal antibody or a single-chain fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody, Cl-esterase inhibitor-N and Natural human C1 Inhibitor.<br>
Recent emphasis on co / morbidity of Ap and cerebralvascular disease, the link between Ap and atherosclerosis, cognitive impairment associated with amyloid angiopathy, significant cerebral microvascular pathology, and deficient clearance of Ap across the Blood Brain Batter in Alzheimer's-Disease, aJI indicate thatvascuiar-disorder is an important feature of chronic neurodegeneration condition In Alzheimer's Disease. (ZIolcovic, B.: (2005) Trends in Neuroscrences 28, 202-208) Therefore, neurovascular dysfunction could have a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.<br>
There is ample evidence of a strong association between cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease and cerebrovascular disorder (Torre, de la, J. C; (2004) Neurol. Res. 26, 517-524, Gorelick, P. B.: (2004) Stroke 35, 2620-2622). Reduced microvascular density, increased numbers of fragmented vessels, marked changed of vessel diameters, etc. have been described in Alzheimer's Disease (Baliey, T. L. et al: (2004) Neurol. Res, 26, 573-578 Farkas, E., and Luiten, P. G.: (2001) Prof. Neurobiol. 64.575-611).<br>
Several studies, including the large population-based Rotterdam study (Greenberg, S. M et al: (2004) Stroke 35, 2616-2619) have shown that vascular risk factors might be responsible for cognitive decline in the elderly - leading to so-called "vascular dementia". Several risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease and vascular dementia overlap, including transient ischemia attacks, atherosclerosis, cardiac disease, high serum viscosity etc.<br>
Vascular dementia occurs as a result of damage to brain tissue following oxygen deprivation caused by narrowed or blocked blood vessels in the brain and it is the second most frequent form of dementia, Palients frequently suffer form both Alzheimer's Dis&amp;ase and vascular dementia. It is estimated that 17 million people in ttie EU and 55.000 people in \\\&amp; USA suffer from vascular dementia.<br>
A therapy restoring normal Oj - pressure in tfie brain, despite blood flow impairmerit has tfie potentra/ of srgnrfrt^nC/y rnfltiendng (he evofulron of Aizhermefs Orsease and reducing dramatically vascular dementia.<br>
It is thus still another embodiment of the invention to provide a vaccine composition v^ich comprises in addition to an A0 peptide antigen, particularly the A|3 peptide antigen according to the invention and as described herein before, a compound which triggers a decrease of the Oi/hemogiobin affinity such that oxygen is released subseiifaent/y to the organ tissues.<br>
In particular, the Oj/hemoglobin affinity modula^ng compound may be a compound selected from the group consisting of an antilipidemic drug such as, for example, clofibric acid or beiafibrate including the bezafibrate derivatives LR15 and L35, urea derivatives such as, for example, [2-[4[l(arylamino)carbonyl]^amino]phenoxy]-2-methylpropionic acid, an allosleric effector of haemoglobin such as, for example, 2,3-dipUosphoglycerate (DPG), inositol hexak/sphosphate (\HP), and pyrtdoxa* phosphate.<br>
More particularly, the O^/hemoglobln affinity modulating compound may be a compound comprising an anioriic ligand for an allosleric site of hemoglobin, wherein the anionic ligand comprises an internal pyrophosphate ring, optionally together with a nontoxic cation.<br>
Even more particu(arfy, the 0?/hemogEobin affinrty moduiating compound is a inositol hexapnosphats OHP) dehvstrve corr^hsing at ieast ore interna} pyropho^pl^ate ring, optionally together witti a nontoxic cation.<br>
In order to capture the beneficial effects offered by a complement inhibitor anci a 0?/hemoglobin affinity modulating compound in alleviating the potentially hamiful effects of an overactivated complement system and cerebrovascular disorders, respectively, the present invention provides a vaccine composition wherein an Ap peptide antigen, particulariy the A^ peptide antigen according to the Invention and described herein before, is comprised jn combination with an inhibitor of the complement system and an 0?/hemogiobin affinity modulating compound, particularly an allosteric effector of hemoglobin.<br>

The modified amyloid 1-15 peptide may be synthesized following l^e method reported in Nicolau et. ai. (2002) Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA 99, 2332-2337. Ttie approach reported in Nicoiau et a1 involves modifying the ar^tigenic peptide by an on-resin grafting of a lipophilic or hydrophobic moiety, to the terminal amino acid residues of a pre-fomned peptide. In particular, a protected amino acid, particularly a Fmoc-protected amino acid, is attached to a resin using known coupling chemistry. The protecting group is removed and a second protected airiino acid reaidud coupled. Standard automated peptide synthesis using knoWh protection chemistry,-particularly Fmoc/IBu chemistry, and standard side-chain protecting groups are then used to synthesis the A^ antigenic peptide, parttcufarly the Apvi5 antigenic peptide by coupling on amino acids 1 to 15 of amytaid pn3tern ABi-42-to produce the peptide fragment wrfh a sequence given in SEQ \D NO:1. in a final step two further protected amino acids are couplsd fo the growng peptide fragment. The Mrt groups can ihert be selectively cleaved and coupted to ;ialmjiic acid. After washing of the resin, the protecting group is removed and the re&amp;ln Simultaneously cleaved, followed by side-chain deprotections using standard methodobgy. The final product can then be obtained In higfi purity and its identity confirmed by methods known in the art such as, for example, eiectrospray mass spectrometry.<br>

Liposoma) antigens according to the invention jinay then be pfGparad sts described in Nicolau et al., 2002. The modified amyioid Ap antigenic peptide, particularly the modified APi.is antigenic peptide may be reconslrtuled in a constnjct consis^ng of liposomes, partlculahy liposomes made of dimynstoyl phosphatidyl choline (DMPC), dimyrisloyi phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DMPEA), dimyristojfl phosphatidyl cjJycerol (DMPG) and cholesterol, optionally containing monophosphoryl lipid A,.<br>
In a spacrfic embodiment of the invention iiposomes with iipid A are u&amp;ed as adjuvant to prepare the anti-amyloid vaccine. Dimyristoylphosphatidyl-choline, -glycerol and cholesterol are mixed;' particularly in a molar ratto of 0.9:10:0.7. A strong- . . immunmodulator such as, for example, monophosphoryl lipid A is then added at a suitable cortcentration, perticuiariy at a concentra^on of between 30 and 50 mg per mmol, more particularly at 40 mg per mmol of phospholipids. The modifiad antigenic Ap peptkle is then added at a moiar ratio peptide to phospholipids of between 1:30 and 1:200. particuiarfy at amofarralioof betv^en 1:50 and 1:120, more particiilarly of 1:100. Solvents are rernoved, for example through evaporation, and the resuming film hydrated with sterile buffer solution such as, for example PBS.<br>
Liposomes may aiso be prepared by the crossftow injection techniQue as described, for example, in Wagner et al (2002) Journal of Liposome Research Vol 12(3), pp 259 - 270. During the injection of lipid solutions into an aqueous buffer system, lipids tend to fonn "pFecipitates^ followed by self arrangement in vesicles. The obtained vesicle size depends on factors such as lipid concentratbn, sttrnnq rate, injection rate, and the choice of lipids. The preparation system may consist of a crossflow injection module, vessels for the polar phase (e.g. a PBS buffer solution), an ethanol/iipid solution vessel and a pressure device, but particularly a nitrogen pressure device. While the aqueous or po}ar solution is pumped through the crasaflow Injection module the ethanoi/itpid solution is injected into the polar phase with varying pressures applied.<br>

1.1      Synthesis ProtocoJ V.<br>
The palmiloylated amyloid 1-15 peptide was synthesized following an improved previously reported method {Nicolau et. al. 2002). This new approach involved on-resin grafting of palmitic acid to the terminal Lys residues of the pre-formed peptide rather than stepwise sof^d-phase synthesis incorporat^tng the modified ^mino acid F:rtoc-<br><br>
Lys(Pal)-OH. This new approach improtfes coupling efficiency ancf gives a product of consj6erab\y higher purify. Thus, the orihogonalfy protected amino acid Fm(K-Lys(Mn}-OH was attached to a Wang resin using HBTU coupling chemistry. The Fmoc group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF and a second residue of Fmc^c-Lys(^Att)-OH was coupled. Standard automated peptide synthesis using Fmoc/tBu chemistry and standanJ side-chain protecting groups was then used to coupfe on the neirt 15 amino adds. Fina^y, the Jasl two amino acids coupted were Fmoc-Lys(Mtt&gt;-OH, The Mtt groups were then selectively deaved using 1% TFA in dichloromethane and then coupled to Palmitic acid using HBTU. After resin wash, the Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine in N, N-DimethyIfomiamide (DMF) and finally simultaneous resin cleavage and sfde-cha^n deprcifecCions were earned otit ustng TFA under standard condition&amp;. Trituration from cold diethyl ether gave the product as a white solid. Eiectrospray' mass spectrametry confirmed- the identity of the product {m^z expected: 1097,9 ([MISH-); found: 1096.B ([M-3H]3+), with no other tri-, di- or mono-palmrtoylated peptides detected.<br>

PalmTtoylation, while providing an anchor *or the peptide in the liposome biiayer, due to the relative reduced length of the Cie.o fa^y acid moiety ieads to the peptide practically laying on the Jjposome surface. Therefore. Ihe ceils processing the ar^tigen wiJ) have to take up the entire liposome v^th the peptide, v^ich could result in a slower Innmune response in relative terms.<br>
To enhance the immune response, another anchor/spacer has been applied to reconatrtiite tfie peptide in the liposome, e.g. polyethyiene glycol (PEG). PEG was covalently attached to the lysine residue bound at both termini of the peptide. At the other end of the chain (PBCn=7D) phosphatidyl ettiano^ amine (PEA) wae coval&amp;ntiy bound to function as the anchoring element in the liposome bilayer Thus, the liposome still functions as an adjuvant and the peptide being sufticiently far away from the bilayer can be processed alone and thus increases its Immunogenicity as compared to the palmiloyJated anirpen.<br>
Methodologies for the mono-psgylation of peptides at the N-a-posltlon are l^nown and wtdefy used. Site-specific mono-pegyiation at internal, N- or C-terminaf amino-acid residues of medium sized peptides has also been described foHowing either solid-phass or peptide-grafting approaches.<br>
In orcJer fo avoid prab^ems w/th steric hindrance, the reactran was carried out /n Che solution-phase. This successful approach involved the synthesis of the peptide sequences using standard Fmoc/Su amino acid s^de-chain protections. For those peptide sequences containing internal Lys or His residues (1-16, 1-15), an orthogonally protected LysdvDde} was added to each termini An addition^ Giy was added to ihe C-terminal to facilitate synthesis. The Fmoc group was removed with 20% pipehdine in DMF and N-acetyiated using acetic anhydride. Selective cleavage of the ivDde groups was achieved with 3% hydrazine hydrate in DMF for 1 hrs. The 2-chlorotrityl resin was favored over the more widely used Wang resin since the former proved to be much more resistant to hydrazinolysia. Furthermore, the 2-ch(orafhtyf resin is extremely acid sensitive and thus, un}}ke th&amp; Wang resin, enabies the }&amp;oiation of protected peptides. Indeed, it was necessary to perform the coupling reaction in the solution phase as coupling of the resin-bound peptide to the pre-act*vated pegylaled lipid reagent DSPE-PEG-SPA did not give rise to any coupling product. Thus selective cleavage from the resin under mild conditions (acetic acid/trifluaroethanol/diohloromethane, 1:1:8, 1 hrs. rt} gave the internal^ protected peptides. products before final side-chain deprotections can be achieved by using cation-exchange chromatography. Subsequent peptide side-chain deprotections and separation of the excess quenched DSPE-PEG-SPA leads to the isolation of the desired conjugates with an acceptabte purrfy.<br>

 EXAMPLE 3: Structur and Conformation analysis<br>
3.1      Analysis ofoanformation of the reconstittited antcgen<br>
To anchor the antigen AB 1-15 on ttie iiposomal surface a palmjtoyialed lysine tandem was used at each end of the peptide as previously described {Nicolau»C.etal, 2002). The fatty acid of the palmitic acid contains 16 carbon atoms which have been shown to have the appropriate length for stable insertion into the liposomal bftayer. In this construct the pept/de is pract/caWy laytng on the surface of the //posome due to the length of the CI 6 fatty acid moiety. In an attempt to have the antigenic peptide associated with liposome-lipid A in a different conformation, another anchor/spacer has been used to reconstitute the peptide Api-16 (ACI-01) in liposomes, namely polyethylene glycol (PEC with 77 repetitive units).The influence of the spacer between the liposomal anchor and the AB peptide on the secondary conformation of the amyloid sequence reconstituted m Itposontes was measured by Circuiar Oichroism (Figure la). The PEGyj3ted Api-16 appears to be in a random coiJ or unstructured protein confomnation (negath/e signal at 210nm and slowly approaching the zero aJcis up to 200nm) v/hereas the palmitoylated peptidfc Ap1-15 contains a significant pn^portion of P-she©t conformation (positive signal up to 210 nm, crossing zero axis then and approaching it again up to 260 nm). It appears therefore that the closer proximity of the paimitoyiated  peptide to  the {fpasomal surface can  impose a  defined  secondary conformation, This is potentially due to etectrasEatrc interactions of ttie peptide with the liposome surface, which is apparently r^ot possib\e with the PEG)^ted peptide.<br>

Here palmitoylic acid and polyehtylene glycol (PEG with n=77). respectively, were used as the linker molecule or anchor to the liposome.<br>
For NMR studies samples encompassing the palmitoylated amyloid ^-^5 (ACl-24) and pegylated Api_i6 antigen (ACI-01) peptides reconstituted in liposomes were homogenized by vorlexing and the concentration of the solution was increased by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 3*90 minutes at 4"C). and the r&amp;sufting wet peifefs transfen'ed /nto MAS n^tors, Addffiona? samples were prepared by suspending the ACl-01 arvj ACJ-24 peptide pr&amp;par^tions at a cortcentration of ImM in PBS buffer at pH 7.2, as wejj a&amp; a 4 mW soJutJon in the same buffer of ttie peptide sequence without JJrtKer. 10% of DjO were added to each sample.<br>
^H HR-MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer operating at a frequency of 500.13 MHz (11 AT) equipped with a 4mm triple resonance CHI^^CI^H) HR-MAS probe. Each sample was introduced into 4mm ZrOj rotors fitted with SOpL cylindrical inserts. For all NMR experiments samples were spun at a frequency equal to the spectral width (6250Rz) which eliminates spinning sidebands from the spectnjm. The one dimensional proton NMR spectra were acquired with both presaturation and the Watergate sequence (Piotlo.Met af (T992);.Piot(o,M., et af (2005)) and by accuirru^frng 1000-1500 scans. The temperature of the bearing air flowing into the probe was sat to 295K to Insure 29SK in the smnpie.<br>
Figures 1 b and 1 c demonstrates the differences in the one dimensional NMR spectra of palmitoylated and pegylated 0-Amyloid peptide. Two significant differences at 9.00 and 8.25 ppm coukJ be obsen/ed. Due to the fact that both peptides have the exactly same amino acid sequence, with the exception of the 16"" Lysine, these differences at 8.00 and 8,25ppm indicate differences in secondary structure because Lysine shouldn't give a positive signal in this spectra area of aromatic annino acid residues.<br>
It could be denrionsirated by one-dimensional proton NMR spectra in the area of aromatit amino acid residues ttiat the specific design of the supramoiecular construct according to the pre&amp;ent invention results in a amyloid antigenic peptide with a unique, tiighly specific and significant seconcfary structure when reconstituted in /(posomes, which (Offers with diifersnt ^ker motecutes. This could m&amp;an that the linker / anchor forces and fixes the peptide into a certain or defined secondary structure which is dependent on the used linker molecule, in case of using these molecules as a vaccine for active immunization it is likely thai antibodies raised against these structurally different antigens will be antigen- and confomiation-specific.<br>
Previous data obtained by ELISA and ORT (object recognrtion task a cognitive memory test) after/mmunization of APP x PS-t mfce of palmitoy/ated Api.i5 and pegy/ated A|3i-ts antigens (see Example beiow&gt; show that oniy the pa^mitf&gt;yiated antigen restore memory impairment in this Alzheimer's Disea&amp;e disease model although both demonstrated the same immunogentcity. The potential mechanism by which two antigens presenting the same peptide causing in vivo two different functional antibodies, is most likely linked to the different secondary structure of the presented peptide caused by the linker technology.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Quantification of externa)- and Interna J-oriented reconstituted peptide<br>
The amount of reconstituted peptide in ACI-01 and ACI-24 was established by a fluorescamine (FLA)-based assay which reacts specifically with primary amines to form high^ fluorescent covalent adducts (Udenfriend, S, et at, 1972). Reaction of FLA with the N-terminuaof thePal1-15 peptide in ACI'24 and with Lys-16 in ACI-01 is anticipated.<br>
in order to separate free peptides from those in »ie liposomes, samples were subjected to ultracer^tflfugation and the resuWng supen:atants analyzed for peptkie content using the FLA assay. No free peptktes were delectable in either ACi-01 or ACJ-24 supematanl.<br>
 Labe/ffig of the pelleted fract'tans with FLA showed very high s&amp;iectivity for reaction whh the peptide in the frposomes both for ACl-24 and ACK01. In order to determine the tofa/ peptide present on the riposome surfaces, fhe essays were repeated in the presence of Triton X-100 (2% in PBS) to disrupt the lipid bifayers. This resulted in a significant increase in labeling; revealing that approxlmaieiy 63 % of peptide is exposed on ttie outer membrane surface. On the other hand, labeling of ACI-01 with FLA only reaches a plateau at 1.2 mM FLA at which concentration the emission is ider^tical when the assay \s performed either in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. This demonstrates that all of the peptide is exposed on the surface of the P&amp;Gyiated v/accir^e ACL-01.<br>

"Young (3-4 morith) female mice were used of a doijbte transgenic mouse strain flxpresaing both mutant human Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP-W171) and mutant human presenilin-l (PSl-A24eE) both under the control of the mouse thyl gene promoter and in F1 (FVB :ejedr All mice iwei"e genot/peO Iwjce durinp their life-span by a second PCR perfonned at the onset of the study, ancj before bhrxj randomization into diff&amp;rent experimental groups.

Briefly, a three month immunization schedule was installed of six bi-weekly inoculations with ACI-01 and ACI-24. One group of mice received empty liposomes as control, the Mice were habituated for 1 hr to a Plexiglas open-field box (52 x 52 x 40 cm) with black vertical walls and a translucent floor dimly illuminated by a lamp placed underneath the box. The next day the animals were placed in the same box and submitted to a 10 min acquisition trial. During this trial mice were placed individually in the open field in the presence of object A (marble or dice), and the time spent exploring object A (when the animal's snout was directed toward the object at a distance 
The retention or cognitive memory capacity of APR x PS-1 mice could be significantly increased by immunization with palmitoylated Api-i5 antigen (ACI-24) compared to control treated APP x PS-1 mice (76.1 ± 3,9% versus 49.1 ± 4.5% for control; Table 3). This proves that ACI-24 immunized mice recognized and remembered the original object for at least 3 hours, thereby eliciting that their motivation and their exploration capacity were intact like a healthy age-, gender-, and strain-matched mice, when compared to healthy non-treated and non-transgenic wiidtype mice (61.8 ± 5,1%). Although ACI-01 peptide is only one C-terminal amino acid longer (the 16'^ Lysine) than ACI-24 peptide and only the linker technology is different between these vaccines, immunization with pegylated Api.ie antigen (ACI-01) doesn't demonstrate any memory restoration (45.6 ± 6.2%) comparable to ACI-24.<br>
