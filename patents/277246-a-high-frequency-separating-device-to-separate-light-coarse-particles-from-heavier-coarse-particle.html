				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a device for particles separation. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device of high -frequency particle separator operatable at 10-80 Hertz to separate light coarser from heavier fine particles and to separate fine heavier particles from a fine lighter particle.<br>
BACK GROUND OP THE INVENTION:<br>
In gravity separators, high density particles are separated form light density particles using specific gravity difference of the particles. This is an ideal technique when high-and low-density particles in the feed are of same size. However, in real particulate system a size range is always treated in place of mono-size particles. It is also well known that feed with narrow size range responds better in any gravity separators. Nonetheless due to many constraints, feed of a size range is always treated in any gravity separators.<br>
In a simplistic manner, a feed composition is traditionally described as a mixture of four different particle types<br>
<br>
2<br>
A.	Coarse heavy (size 6 mm to 10 mm and density 4.4)<br>
B.	Coarse light (size 6 mm to 10 mm and density 2.6)<br>
C.	Fine heavy (size 1 mm to 4 mm and density 4.4)<br>
D.	Fine light (size 1 mm to 4 mm and density 2.6)<br>
Separation of fine light form the rest is easy while the separation of coarse light form heavies is difficult and the reasons can be explained from the fundamental understanding of process dynamics in each case. In case of hydrocyclone operation, a part of coarse light reports to heavier fractions when overall high yield is targeted through better yield of fine heavy in the heavier fraction (concentrate). An example from iron ore beneficiation, -0.5 mm size particles are often treated on Stub Cyclone. The process can reduce the alumina content from a feed containing 4-5% alumina. However, it can seldom produce the concentrate of desired grade that is 2.0% or less alumina content. Chemical analysis would reveal that the cyclone concentrate contain coarser alumina rich (lighter) particles along with iron rich (heavy) particles. This is schematically explained through Figure 4 (a). Separation through high - frequency separator will be helpful in bringing down the alumina level to 2.0% or less form the present<br>
<br>
3<br>
cyclone concentrate having alumina level of 2.5%. In some other equipments, which uses liquid/solid fluidization techniques for separation (viz. Jig and Floatex), finer heavies reports to coarser lights. An example from jig rejects contains coarse lights (i.e. reject quality material) and small heavies (i.e. concentrate grade particles). This is schematically explained in Figure 4(b). This happens due to mixing of particles during the fluidization phase of jig cycle. Mixing is inevitable when we treat feed with wide size range (-10+0-5 mm) particles in jig. A high-frequency separator is ideal for recovering fine heavies form the jig reject and thus the overall yield of the process will improve. Therefore, separation of coarser lights from finer heavies is a challenge. The proposed equipment will find its use in separating coarser lights from fine heavies.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose of device of high frequency separator, which eliminates the disadvantages of Prior Art<br>
<br>

Another object of the present invention is to propose a device high frequency separator, which helps in separation of coarser light particles form heavies.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: Equipment description<br>
The present invention relates to a simple equipment provided with a hopper and a vibratory feeder. The vibratory feeder will have a facility to control the frequency of vibration in the ranee of 10-80 Hertz. It will also have an online facility to measure the operation frequency of the vibrator.<br>
Method<br>
A feed consisting of a mixture of coarser lights (size 6 mm to 10 mm, density 2.6) finer heavies size 1 mm to 4 mm density 4.4 coarser heavies (size 6 mm to 10 mm density 4.6) and fine lights of site 1 mm to 4 mm density 2.6 will be fed to the hopper and then the frequency of vibration will be tuned so that the applied frequency matches with the normal frequency of the coarser lights. This process will cause<br>
<br>
5<br>
resonance of the coarser lights which then moves up while traveling along the chute of the vibrator, Figure 2A and 2B shows mixed status of the particles in the feeding end and segregated particles at the discharge end of the chute. A cutter placed at the discharge end of the chute finally divides the segregated layer into two products. Bach of the products can be further beneficiated by passing it again over the high-frequency separator.<br>
Principle<br>
This process of separation is based on a well known concept which is known as Tune Mass Damper (TMD) concept It defines natural frequency of each particle in a paniculate assemblage as<br>
<br>
Where, k is spring constant and m is the mass of the particle. Spring constant for the coarser particles will be higher. Thus coarser lights and smaller heavies with same mass will have different natural frequency range. This is schematically explained in Figure 3. In case<br>
<br>

applied frequency matches with the natural frequency of coarse light; the fraction gets segregated at the top of the bed on vibration.<br>
