DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a three-dimensional sphere 1 in accordance with a preferred embodiment is shown. Figure 2 shows a cross section through this sphere along A-A.<br>
With reference to Figures 7 to 10, different configurations of puzzle pieces 2 are shown. Each playing piece 2 has an outer area 3 which forms the exterior surface of the three-<br><br>
dimensional sphere 1. This area 3 is connected to the centroid via a connector comprising a spacer 4 and a connector element 5.<br>
Many different combinations of the elements that comprise each puzzle piece can be integrally moulded. For example, as shown in Figure 7, the puzzle area 2 may be integrally moulded with the spacer 4. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 8, the puzzle piece 2 may comprise a separate puzzle area 2 which is then associated with a integrally moulded connector comprising the spacer 4 and connector element 5.<br>
In some embodiments said area 3 may have indentations, projections, contours or surface configurations that project form the general surface of the sphere. In addition, due to the rounded shape of a sphere, the area 3 of each puzzle piece 2 may curve downwardly at its edges to help produce a more rounded sphere.<br>
In one embodiment one or more (or all), of an edge or part thereof, of a playing piece is/are rounded. Preferably at least one corner of a playing piece is rounded. More preferably<br>
each corner of a substantially triangular playing piece (ofthe area's peripheral surface) is roimded. This helps facilitate smooth interaction between each adjacent playing piece 2.<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 10, said puzzle piece 2 may comprise an area 3 in the form of a tile. In one embodiment each tile is connected to a centroid 7 via a connector 5, said connector comprising a spacer 4 and a connector element 5. A stated above, many different combinations of each element could be integrally moulded.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each puzzle piece 2 is connected to the centroid 7 using magnetic attraction.<br>
It should be appreciated that a number of different configurations providing for the magnetic interaction can be provided For example, each of said connectors 5, or part thereof, may be formed from a magnetic element e.g. rare earth magnet, with the centroid 7, or part thereof being formed from a ferrous metal. In this embodiment the centroid 7 may be formed as a spherical ball, a hollow spherical ball or a steel lattice ball surrounding the periphery of the centroid 7. Other configurations may also be used that allow rotation of said playing pieces 2 around the centroid. When configured as a steel latticed ball said centroid 7 is arranged such that the steel lattice lines are oriented around the centroid 7 so as to follow the lines of demarcation of the playing pieces 2. Alternately the steel lattice lines surrounding the periphery of the centroid 7 may be oriented so that the playing pieces 2 travel around the sphere over the said steel lattice lines.<br>
In an alternate embodiment the centroid 7, or part thereof may comprise the magnetic element and therefore the connector 5, or part thereof comprise the ferrous element<br><br>
Preferably the magnetic element used is a rare earth magnet In such an instance the centroid 7 may be, for example, a spherical magnet, a hollow spherical magnet or a lattice ball of magnets surrounding the periphery of the centroid 7. Other configurations may also be used that allow rotation of said playing pieces 2 around the centroid 7. When used as a magnetic latticed ball said centroid 7 is ammgral such that the lattice lines of the centroid magnets are oriented around the ceotnad 7 so as to follow the lines of demarcation of the playing pieces 2. Alternately the lattice Hoes of magnets sunomdmg the centroid may be oriented so that the playing pieces 2 travel aroond the sphere over the said lattice lines.<br>
While Figures 8 to 10 depict the connector element 5 as a separate entity to that of the spacer 4 and the area 3 (whilst optionally integrally moulded), it is envisaged that the connector element may focm an integral component of each puzzle piece 2. For example, said puzzle piece 2 may comprise., wholly or in part, a moulded material having magnetic properties.<br>
Preferably when said puzzle piece(s) 2 comprises a magnet, said magnet is located distal to said area 3. i.e. located adjacent to the surface of said centroid 7.<br>
In one embodiment the entire connector may be a magnet In an alternate embodiment the magnet may only form a small part of the connector such that the magnet is embedded in the connector with only its lower surface (i.e that surface to be adjacent to said centroid 7) located at or near the lower surface of said puzzle piece 2. With reference to Figure 15 the connector element 5 is shown as a magnet recessed into the playing piece 2. The lower periphery 15 of the puzzle piece can be seen to project beyond that of the magnet Therefore, as the playing piece 2 is moved around the centroid 7 it is the material of the lower periphery 15 of the playing piece 2 (Le. plastics) that contacts the centroid 7, and not the actual magnet itself. As shown in Figure 15 the magnet projects only a short way up into the playing piece 2. It should be appreciated that many dimensions of magnets could be used For example, magnets with dimensions that extend a greater proportion of the way into a puzzle piece 2, and/or magnets of varying width in relation to the width of fee playing piece 2.<br>
When said centroid 7 is in a hollow form it should be appreciated that any number of objects could be encased within the periphery of said centroid 7 such as a glow ball or the<br>
like.<br>
As depicted in Figures 7 to 10, said puzzle area 3 forms a spherical surface with a diameter greater than that of the centroid 7. In order to achieve this, each puzzle piece 2 comprises a spacing element which projects the puzzle area 3 from the surface of the centroid Figures 7 and 8 depict a wedge-shaped spacer 4, while Figures 9 and 10 depict a rod like<br><br>
mechanism. Alternate embodiments may also include spacers of a shape that can project puzzle area 3 from the surface of the contours. For example, contoured or scalloped shaped wedge-like spacers could be used. An advantage of such spacers as these is that they would project the puzzle area 3 from the surface of the centroid while using less material and retaining strength to raider<br>
It should be appreciated that the relative size of the centroid 7 to the total puzzle size can be varied, i.e. to pot another way, it should be appreciated that the height of the playing pieces 2 could range grcafly relative to the size of fee ceofeoid 7. For example, it can be seen that the ratio of the hogl ID wkfch is greater for the pazzie piece 2 shown in Figure IS compared to Figure 16. It shook! also be appreciated feat as fee height of a playing piece 2 decreases relative to its vridfe, fee distance of fee magnet to fee edge of the playing piece can be increased therefore deoeasing the magnefe interaction wife other adjacent playing pieces. This can be seen when comparing fee puzzle piece 2 of Figure 16 to feat of the puzzle piece 2 shown in Figure 15-<br>
It should also be appreciated that the magnetic element can extend any part thereof through the playing piece.<br>
A number of different types of three-dimensional spheres are envisaged. Some non-limiting examples are as follows:<br>
Sphere 1<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in one embodiment said three-dimensional sphere 1 comprises twenty-six playing pieces of which eighteen are of the substantially square form and eight are of fee substantially triangular form. In this particular embodiment fee substantially square form playing pieces 2 are arranged in three equatorial bands, comprising 8 square form playing pieces each, along each of the three Cartesian axis. Therefore, each band can rotate around fee ceofroid 7 at 90° relative to each other. Those squares that are placed at fee intersection between two Cartesian bands (e.g. x-axis and y-axis) are therefore able to be rotated in either direction of each of the two Cartesian axis (e.g. horizontal or vertical). Each square may be rotated in a direction, as discussed, so that each square indexes to a position help by a previous square. For example, if fee square playing pieces are rotated around said centroid 7 by one position, then they fill a playing position which was previously filled by an adjacent square playing piece. Said substantially square playing pieces may be rotated any number of playing positions.<br>
With reference to a single Cartesian equatorial band, there also exists rotating caps that are comprised of substantially square form and substantially triangular form playing pieces 2.<br><br>
As there are three Cartesian equatorial bands, it should be apparent that there are two sets of caps per Gartesian axis. Le. six said caps per sphere.<br>
In a preferred embodiment said rotating caps are comprised of five substantially square form playing pieces and four substantially triangular form playing pieces. Said rotating caps rotate about the centroid in the same equatorial plane, but distal to, said single Cartesian equatorial reference band.<br>
Preferably said cap is rotated two playing positions at a time. This ensures that said substantially triangular playing pieces fill a playing position filled previously by another triangular playing piece.<br>
Preferably the length of indexing sides of each of the substantially square and triangular form playing pieces are substantially similar are substantially similar to that of the playing piece they index to. More preferably the chord lengths S of each of the indexing sides of each playing piece are substantially similar. As used herein "chord length" is die length of the sides of the playing pieces when taken from corner to corner. As shown by Figure 6, in a three-dimensional sphere comprising 8 squares in an equatorial band, the chord lengths 8 are the length of the sides (corner to comer) of each playing piece 2, when arranged as a octagon in a sphere.<br>
Sphere 2<br>
With reference to Figure 3, in a further embodiment, said three-dimensional sphere comprises sixty-two playing pieces of which thirty are of a substantially square form and thirty two are of a substantially triangular form. In this particular embodiment the substantially square form playing pieces 2 are arranged in three equatorial bands, comprising 12 square form playing pieces each, along each of the three Cartesian axis. Therefore, each band can rotate around the centroid 7 at 90° relative to each other. Those squares that are placed at the intersection between two Cartesian bands (e.g. x-axis and y-axis) are therefore able to be rotated in either direction of each of the two Cartesian axis (e.g. horizontal or vertical). Each square may be rotated in a direction, as discussed, so that each square indexes to a position help by a previous square. For example, if the square playing pieces are rotated around said centroid 7 by one position, then they fill a playing position which was previously filled by an adjacent square playing piece. Said substantially square playing pieces may be rotated any number of playing positions.<br>
With reference to a single Cartesian equatorial band, there also exists two rotating caps that are comprised of substantially square form and substantially triangular form playing<br><br>
pieces 2.  As there are three Cartesian equatorial bands, it should be apparent that there are two sets of each cap per Cartesian axis. Le. six of each a first and second said cap per sphere.<br>
The first said rotating cap about the centroid in the same equatorial plane, but distal to, said single Cartesian equatorial reference band so thai the base of the cap is the perimeter of said single Cartesian equatorial reference band. Said first rotating cap is comprised of nine substantially square form playing pieces and sixteen substantially triangular form pieces. Said substantially trimgnhr form pieces are arranged as a multiplicity of a subset of triangular forms which together co-act to form a larger triangular piece.<br>
In one embodiment said multiplicity of a subset of triangular forms comprise a larger triangular piece which is not subdivided.<br>
The second sad rotating cap is positioned distal to said rotating cap, and forms a subset of playing pieces of said first rotating cap. Preferably said second rotating cap comprises five substantially square form pieces and four substantially triangular form pieces.<br>
Preferably said first cap is rotated three playing positions at a time. This ensures that said substantially triangular playing pieces fill a playing position filled previously by another triangular playing piece.<br>
Preferably said second cap is rotated two playing positions at a time. This ensures that said substantially triangular playing pieces fill a playing position filled previously by another triangular playing piece.<br>
Preferably the length of indexing sides of each of the substantially square and triangular form playing pieces are substantially similar to that of the playing piece they index to. More preferably the chord lengths 8 of each of the indexing sides of each playing piece are. substantially similar. As used herein "chord length" is the length of the sides of the playing pieces when taken from corner to corner.<br>
Sphere 3<br>
With reference to Figure 4, in one embodiment said three-dimensional sphere 1 compriseis forty-eight playing pieces of which twenty-four-are of the substantially square form and twenty-four are of the substantially triangular form- In this particular embodiment both said substantially square form playing pieces and substantially triangular form playing pieces are arranged in dual equatorial bands along each of the three Cartesian axis. As used herein "dual equatorial bands" refers to ah arrangement whereby two adjacent bands of playing pieces 2 are arranged around said centroid 7 wherein each equatorial band lies either side of the sphere equator. This arrangement of dual equatorial bands are repeated in each of die three<br><br>
Cartesian axis. Each band comprises eight substantially square form playing pieces and 4 substantially triangular playing pieces (as seen in Figure 4).<br>
Each dual equatorial band can rotate around the centroid 7 at 90° relative to each other, whilst each band of the dual equatorial band arrangement rotates in the same plane of rotation as each other. Those squares that are placed at the intersection between two Cartesian bands (e.g. x-axis and y-axis) are therefore able to be rotated m either direction of each of the two Cartesian axis (e.g. horizontal or vertical). Each band may be rotated around said cenbaid 7 by 90° or multiples thereof<br>
With reference to a single Cartesian equatorial band, there also exists two rotating caps that are comprised of substantially square form and substantially trismgnkw form playing pieces. As there are three Cartesian equatorial bands, ft should be apparent feat there are two sets of each cap per Cartesian axis. i.e. six of each a first and second said cap pea- sphere.<br>
The first said rotating cap, by virtue of the presence of a equatorial demarcation line 10, allows rotation of one half of the sphere in relation to fee remaining half. Said first rotating cap is comprised of twelve substantially square form playing {nieces and twelve substantially triangular form pieces.<br>
The second said rotating cap is positioned distal to said rotating cap, and forms a subset of playing pieces of said first rotating cap. Preferably said second rotating cap comprises four substantially square form pieces and eight substantially triangular form pieces.<br>
Preferably said first cap is rotated 90° at a time. This ensures that both said substantially triangular and square form playing pieces fill a playing position filled previously by another triangular or square form playing piece respectively.<br>
Preferably said second cap is rotated 90° at a time. This ensures that both said substantially triangular and square form playing pieces fill a playing position filled previously   by another triangular or square form playing piece respectively.<br>
Preferably the length of indexing sides of each of fee substantially square and triangular form playing pieces are substantially similar to that of the playing piece they index to. More preferably the chord lengths 8 of each of the indexing sides of each playing piece are substantially similar. As used herein "chord length" is the length of the sides of the playing, pieces when taken from corner to corner.<br>
Indexing<br>
In one embodiment fee movement of said playirig pieces 2 between playing positions provides feedback to the user. Said feedback allows the user to determine when the playing<br><br>
pieces are indexed correctly into a playing position. Preferably said feedback during movement provides at least one or more of the following outcomes:<br>
a)	a sense of moving beyond an indexed position, and<br>
b)	a sense of indexing to a correct playing position.<br>
Said feedback mechanism can be a noise, a "fed" i.e. due to a physical mechanism, or a change in a physical feature of said sphere 1 thai can indicate to the user when the playing pieces 2 are moved, or correctly indexed to a playing position 2.<br>
With reference to Figures 11 to 13, in one embodiment said feedback mechanism is provided by a ratcheting mechanism 11 which provides a sound and/or a feel when said playing pieces 2 are moved due to the interaction with said ratcheting mechanism 11 with a physical projection that interacts with said ratcheting mechanism 11.<br>
In one embodiment said ratcheting mechanism 11 is localised on the surface of a said playing piece (refer Figure 11). Preferably said ratcheting mechanism 11 is localised on said substantially square form playing piece.<br>
In one embodiment said physical projection is in the form of a projection that is on a playing piece that does not have localised thereto a ratcheting mechanism. Preferably said physical projection is able to interact with said ratcheting mechanism 11 to provide feedback to the user as to when a playing piece is moved.<br>
In one embodiment wherein said ratcheting mechanism 11 is localised on said substantially square form playing piece, said physical projection is localised on said substantially triangular form playing piece. Preferably said physical projection is in the form of a ball bearing 12 or the like.<br>
In one embodiment said ball bearing 12 is projected fiom a cavity in the side of said substantially triangular form playing piece so as to interact with said ratcheting mechanism 11 (refer Figures 12 and 13).<br>
In one embodiment said ball bearing 12 is connected to a spring mechanism 13 which causes said ball bearing 12 to exert pressure on said ratcheting mechanism 11.<br>
In one embodiment the feedback allowing the user to sense when the playing piece are correctly indexed is provided for by an indentation 14 in the side of the playing piece which interacts with said playing piece 2 containing the ball bearing 12 (refer Figure 13). In this embodiment the interaction of the ball bearing 12 with the ratcheting mechanism 11 and indentation 14 allow the user to determine when the playing pieces are being moved, and when they are in correct alignment respectively.<br><br>
In one embodiment said feedback may be provided for by an interaction between said centroid 7 and said playing pieces. Said feedback mechanism may be as described above or any other mechanism that allows the user to determine when the playing pieces are being moved, and when they are in comet alignment respectively.<br>
Surface Shapes<br>
In one embodiment said area 3 is substantially flat In alternate embodiments said area 3 may have mrtnrtaTims, projections, contours, m»Hrfngg or the like. As shown in Figure 14, said area may have surface attentions whilst still retaining the substantially square or triangular area. form.<br>
Alterations tote area 2 detracting Iron a substantially flat surface may be in any form so long as they allow the playing pieces 2 to be moved or indexed relative to each other without interference from adjacent playing pieces 2. Such surface alterations may be in many different forms including difftatait shapes, colours etc.<br>
In one embodiment said sphere 1 may be configured as a "lunar ball" wherein said surface alterations are to give a sense of a lunar landscape.<br>
In a further embodiment said sphere 1 may be configured as a globe, wherein said surface alterations are to convey an earth-like sphere.<br>
In a further embodiment said sphere 1 may be configured as a face wherein said playing pieces exhibit a fecial feature, and wherein the migration of said playing pieces 2 can form different configurations of fecial features.<br>
In a further embodiment the overall shape of the puzzle may be of any other geometrical shape such as square or triangular. This can be achieved by the area of each playing piece being built up so that the overall shape of the puzzle becomes a desired geometrical shape. Thus rotation of the playing piece will result in uneven surface projections as a result of a non-spheroid outer geometrical shape rotating around a sphere form centroid 7 (e.g. rotation of a square around the spheroid centroid 7).<br>
The novel three-dimensional spherical puzzle or display platform is susceptible to variations and modifications which may be introduced thereto without departing from the inventive concept For example, the number of playing pieces 2 and the shape of the areas 2 may be modified.<br>
In addition, it should be appreciated that whilst a spherical surface area is the preferred embodiment of the current invention, the external area may form other shapes such as a square shape as seen with Rubik's cubes.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 17, this shows a three-dimensional sphere 1 interacting with a single levitate 16 located below said three-dimensional sphere 1. As shown in Figure 1, the exterior surface of the three-dimensional sphere 1 is preferably of a uniform polarity (i.e. either north or south).<br>
It should be appreciated that the in some embodiments the surface of the sphere does not have to be of absolute uniform polarity, so long as the overall polarity of the surface of one polarity.<br>
Alternately said levitate could have a mix of polarities. In one embodiment said levitate 16 is comprised of at least two tings erf magnets. Said outer ring of magnets are of a polarity equal to that of the surface of the sphere, whereas the inner ring is of opposite polarity. Further inner rings may also be mrimted of either polarity.<br>
The levitate 16 can act upon a three-dimensional sphere 1 by using magnetic attractive or repulsive forces, or a combination of both. Le. If a single levitate 16 is positioned below the three-dimensional sphere 1 is used, as depicted in Figure 17, then the polarity of the surface of said levitate 16 must be of the same polarity as that of the surface of said three-dimensional sphere 1. If a single levitate 16 is positioned above said three-dimensional sphere 1 then is uses magnetic attractive forces to maintain levitation of said three-dimensional sphere 1, In this instance the overall polarity of the surface of the levitate 16 feeing said three-dimensional sphere 1 must be opposite to the polarity of said three-dimensional sphere 1. If two levitates 16 are used, one above and one below said three-dimensional sphere 1, then the bottom levitate 16 will have its surface feeing said three-dimensional sphere 1 having a polarity the same as the surface of said three-dimensional sphere 1, and the levitate 16 above said three-dimensional sphere 1 will have the polarity of its surface feeing said three-dimensional sphere 1 as being the opposite of the polarity of the surface of said three-dimensional sphere 1.<br>
Preferably the comers of the levitate(s) 16 are inclined as seen in Figure 16. This creates lines of magnetic flux that will levitate said three-dimensional sphere 1 into the middle of the dish. It should be appreciated that any shaped levitate 16 can be used so long as the lines of flux are oriented so as to keep the levitate in a stable position.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the magnet could be mounted gyroscopically inside of the centroid 7 so that the orientation of the magnets polarity is static relative to the orientation of the puzzle. In such an embodiment as this the connector element 5 of the puzzle piece could be formed of a ferrous metal. Therefore, the induced polarity of the ferrous metal would<br><br>
change as the puzzle piece 2 is rotated about the centroid therefore maintaining an attractive magnetic force with the centroid 7.<br>
Example 1<br>
A puzzle form of said sphere 1 can be used on the same basis as the Rubik's concept i.e. each piece can be variously identified y colour, markings, contour etc, and thus rotation of pieces can be performed so as to achieve a particular pattern or game objective (e.g. pattern arrangement). Exaj»ple2<br>
An object of the game may be to start with the centroid only and add on each playing piece between competing players. Thus when the pieces are all arranged around the centroid, the aim of the game can be as aforesaid.<br><br><br>
