				<td>LEAD SLAG REDUCTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for lead slag reduction, utilising top-<br>
submerged lance injection.<br>
Top-submerged lance (TSL) injection was developed in the early<br>
1970's. Since then, the technology has become widely adopted for new start-<br>
up plants for processing a range of non-ferrous, ferrous and waste materials.<br>
The TSL technology utilises a bath smelting system in which a vertically<br>
suspended lance has its lower tip submerged in molten slag layer of the bath<br>
contained in a suitable furnace. Process gases, such as air or air and oxygen,<br>
and fuel are injected through the lance into the slag. The fuel is combusted at<br>
the lance tip to provide heat to the furnace. The injection generates turbulence<br>
in, and splashing of, the slag such that the slag is thoroughly mixed.<br>
Controlled swirling of the process gas as it flows through the lance cools the<br>
lance outer surface sufficiently to solidify slag splashed onto the lance and<br>
form a slag layer which protects the lance in the highly aggressive furnace<br>
environment.<br>
The TSL bath smelting system utilises reactions between sulphidic,<br>
oxidic and/or metallic components in the slag or provided as feed to the bath,<br>
and contained oxygen and ferric oxide in the bath. Critical process<br>
phenomena including feed material dissolution, energy transfer, reaction and<br>
primary combustion, all take place in the slag layer. The intense agitation of<br>
the slag resulting from the submerged injection through the lance ensures that<br>
reactions occur rapidly and residence times are low.<br>
The degree of process oxidation and reduction is able to be controlled<br>
by adjusting the ratio of fuel to oxygen supplied to and through the lance, and<br>
by the proportion of reductant to feed. The furnace is able to be operated<br>
through a range of conditions from strongly oxidising to strongly reducing<br>
conditions.<br><br>
TSL technology has been used to smelt lead concentrates and<br>
secondary feeds at a temperature of from about 950°C to 1200°C, preferably<br>
in the range of 1000°C to 1100°C, to directly produce lead bullion and a lead<br>
rich slag, such as a slag having from 30 to 50 wt% lead. The lead bullion,<br>
such as with about 98 wt% lead, is tapped periodically from the furnace during<br>
smelting, for transfer to a lead refinery. The slag remaining is subjected to a<br>
lead reduction operation, to recover further lead and produce a discardable low<br>
lead slag. The smelting also produces a lead fume product which is returned<br>
to a subsequent smelting cycle to maximise recovery of lead to bullion.<br>
In some instances, the high lead slag produced by such use of the TSL<br>
technology has been sent to a blast furnace for reduction and further recovery<br>
of lead bullion. The slag from the blast furnace then has been sent to a slag<br>
fumer for recovery of zinc as fume. In other instances, the high lead slag has<br>
been subjected to reduction and fuming stages by further application of TSL<br>
technology.<br>
The TSL processing of the high lead slag resulting from smelting has<br>
been conducted as second and third stages of reduction and fuming,<br>
respectively, using the same reactor as used for the first stage of smelting, in a<br>
three stage batch process. In an alternative, the high lead slag has been<br>
tapped periodically from a continuous TSL smelting furnace, and transferred to<br>
a second furnace in which the slag is subjected to a reduction stage and,<br>
optionally, to a fuming stage. In each case, the reduction stage is operated<br>
with a lower oxygen potential and a higher temperature, such as about<br>
1250°C, than used in the smelting stage. Lead is recovered from the slag<br>
during the reduction stage as bullion which is tapped for downstream refining.<br>
A lead fume product from the reduction stage is recycled to the smelting stage<br>
to maximise recovery of lead to bullion. A resultant low lead slag, such as with<br>
about 5% lead, can be tapped and processed separately, or it can undergo a<br>
TSL fuming step to clean the slag and maximise metal recovery.<br>
The TSL slag fuming stage uses a more strongly reducing furnace<br>
environment than the reduction stage. The intense bath turbulence and gas<br><br>
dynamics of the TSL operation are used to remove much of the remaining lead<br>
and zinc as fume, leaving a slag suitable for discard, such as with about 0.5<br>
wt% lead and about 3 wt% zinc. When lead concentrates have been smelted,<br>
the slag from the reduction stage will usually contain significant levels of zinc,<br>
in which case the fume product from the fuming stage is high in zinc oxide,<br>
such as from about 50 to 70 wt% zinc. This fume is not suitable for recycling<br>
to the smelting stage, but needs to be removed from the system for separate<br>
processing to recover the zinc and lead.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the reduction of<br>
a lead containing slag. The slag may be that resulting from the TSL smelting<br>
of a lead source material, such as at least one of lead concentrate, secondary<br>
lead sources including lead acid batteries, and recycled lead containing metal.<br>
However, the invention also can be applied to a suitable lead containing slag<br>
from another source, such as another bath smelting process. Also, while the<br>
lead content of slag from TSL smelting of a lead concentrate may be in the<br>
range of 40 to 50 wt%, slag with a lower or higher lead content can be used in<br>
the process of the present invention. Indeed, at the lower end, the lead<br>
content need only be at a level sufficient to warrant reducing the slag to<br>
achieve a level of about 5 wt% lead in the slag.<br>
Traditional processing of lead via pyrometallurgical routes has involved<br>
the reduction of high lead slags by carbonaceous materials, using a range of<br>
apparatus types. Lead blast furnaces typically utilise relatively expensive coke<br>
as carbonaceous reductant. Modern bath smelting technologies, such as TSL<br>
technology, employ coal, a cheaper carbonaceous reductant. We have found<br>
that unexpected benefits are able to be obtained from use of an alternative<br>
reductant, instead of coal or other carbonaceous reductant, in slag reduction<br>
using TSL technology.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for lead<br>
slag reduction, wherein the slag is subjected to top-submerged lance injection<br>
of oxygen containing gas and fuel, via a vertically suspended lance having its<br>
lower tip end submerged in the slag, to generate a combustion zone in the slag<br><br>
in which fuel is combusted and to generate turbulent conditions forming a slag<br>
coating on the lower extent of the lance which is solidified by the cooling effect<br>
of the injected gas. The TSL injection is conducted under reducing conditions,<br>
using a sulphidic material as a reductant, to reduce lead in the slag to metallic<br>
lead and thereby form a molten lead phase which is tapped as lead bullion.<br>
The sulphidic material may be any sulphide containing material which is<br>
compatible with the process of lead recovery by lead slag reduction. The<br>
sulphidic material may be a bulk concentrate, such as a bulk lead/zinc/silver<br>
concentrate, a lead or zinc concentrate, sulphidic drosses, pyrites, or a mixture<br>
of two or more such materials. The sulphidic material preferably is a lead<br>
concentrate, such as that smelted in generating the slag to be subjected to the<br>
lead slag reduction of the invention.<br>
The process of the present invention obviates the need for use of<br>
carbonaceous reductant. While a minor proportion of carbonaceous reductant<br>
can be tolerated, this is not desirable as it partially reduces the benefits<br>
obtainable with use of sulphidic material alone as reductant. Also, some<br>
concentrates contain a proportion of carbonaceous material, such as graphite,<br>
and an increase in that proportion is not desirable.<br>
In obviating the need for carbonaceous reductant, the use of sulphidic<br>
material as reductant reduces greenhouse gas emissions. That is, generation<br>
of CO and CO2 is substantially avoided, although some small quantity of CO2<br>
may result to the extent that the sulphidic material contains oxidation product<br>
such as lead carbonate and graphitic materials.<br>
As indicated, the sulphidic material obviates the need for use of carbonaceous<br>
material, and even minor proportions of carbonaceous material are not desirable.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that carbonaceous material can be present in<br>
combination with the sulphidic material if the resultant carbon dioxide can be<br>
tolerated, such as if facilities are provided for its capture.<br>
The use of sulphidic material as reductant of course	results in<br>
generation of S02. However, as will be appreciated, the S02	content of<br>
furnace off-gases are able to be recovered and utilised, such	as in the<br>
production of sulphuric acid.<br>
The present invention, as illustrated later herein, also has further<br>
practical benefits. The use of a sulphidic material reductant surprisingly<br><br>
enables a better separation of lead and zinc, to give more efficient processing.<br>
Also, the sulphidic material reductant results in higher productivity of lead per<br>
smelt/reduction cycle where the sulphidic material contains lead.<br>
Particularly with the use of lead sulphide concentrate as the sulphidic<br>
material reductant, the lead slag reduction process of the present invention is<br>
well suited for use as a second stage following a TSL lead concentrate first<br>
stage smelting of a lead containing feed material. Such a second stage may<br>
be conducted in a separate furnace rather than the same furnace used for the<br>
first stage smelting. However, there are particular benefits in conducting the<br>
two stages (and optionally a third stage of slag fuming) in the one furnace.<br>
Thus, on achieving a sufficient volume of slag produced in the first stage<br>
smelting, it is necessary only to:<br>
(i) continue rather than stop the feeding of lead sulphide concentrate<br>
following termination of the first stage; and<br>
(ii) reduce the oxygen content of the injected oxygen-containing gas<br>
from the level used in the first stage to the level suitable for the lower<br>
oxygen potential required in the second stage.<br>
In the first stage (whether in the same or a different furnace used for the<br>
second stage), oxygen is used as the driving force to convert lead sulphide<br>
into lead metal through the direct reaction:<br>
with 1 <br><br>
Pb(1) -» Pb(g)	(5)<br>
In this Pb-S-0 system, the lead can report to any of the metal, slag or fume<br>
phases.<br><br>
In the second, slag reduction stage, lead oxide in the slag is reduced by<br>
sulphidic material reductant. The following equations, for use of lead<br>
concentrate as the sulphidic material reductant, describe the reactions<br>
involved at 1200°C:<br>
2PbO(slag) + PbS-+3Pb(1) + S02(g)	K=26.7	(6)<br>
2PbO(slag) + PbS-+3Pb(g)+S02(g)	K=1.2x10-6	(7)<br>
2ZnO(slag) + PbS — Pb(l) + 2Zn(1) + S02(g) K=3.4 x 10"7	(8)<br>
2ZnO(slag) + PbS — Pb(i,) + 2Zn(g) + S02(g) K=4.5 x 10"6	(9)<br>
From equations (6) to (9) it can be determined that, by using lead sulphide<br>
such as lead sulphide concentrate to carry out the reduction, the equilibria<br>
favour the deportment of lead to the molten bullion phase and zinc to the slag<br>
as zinc oxide. This enhances the separation between the lead and zinc so that<br>
lead can be removed during the reduction stage, maximising the retention of<br>
zinc in the slag for subsequent fuming. We have found that a key to this slag<br>
reduction stage is the degree to which lead can be reduced from the slag by<br>
lead sulphide before sulphur accumulates in the bullion. We have found that<br>
lead levels in slag down to about 5% lead are achievable before the level of<br>
sulphur dioxide in the furnace offgas begins to diminish, indicating that reaction<br>
(6) was substantially reduced or no longer is effective.<br>

process according to the invention corresponding to the flow chart of Figure 3.<br>
Figure 1 shows a TSL furnace 10 suitable for use in the present invention but<br>
which is shown partly cut-away to reveal its interior. The furnace 10 has a<br>
cylindrical lower portion 12 for containing a molten bath 14 comprising slag, or<br>
having an upper layer of slag. Extending from the upper extent of lower<br>
portion 12, the furnace 10 has an asymmetrical, frusto-conical roof portion 16<br>
and, above portion 16, an off-take flue 18. The portions 12 and 16 of furnace<br>
10 typically have an outer shell 20 of steel which is lined with suitable<br>
refractory 22.<br>
A vertically suspended lance 24 extends to the furnace 10, close to the axis of<br>
portion 12. The lance 24 passes through the roof portion 16 and is able to be<br>
raised or lowered by a carriage (not shown) to which the upper end of lance 24<br>
is connected. The carriage is moveable vertically on a guide structure (also<br><br>
not shown). By means of lance 24, an oxygen-containing gas and a suitable<br>
fuel is able to be injected into the bath 14. Also, feed materials are able to be<br>
charged to the furnace 10, to fall into the bath 14, via inlet port 26. Means (not<br>
shown) are provided for substantially sealing around the opening in furnace<br>
portion 16 through which lance 24 passes, and at port 26. Also, furnace 10 is<br>
kept below atmospheric pressure to prevent gases from exiting from the<br>
furnace 10 other than via flue 18.<br>
The lance 24 in the arrangement illustrated comprises a concentric<br>
arrangement of an outer tube 27, an intermediate tube 28 and an inner tube<br>
29. The outer tube 27 terminates a substantial distance above the lower, tip<br>
end of lance 24 and above the bath 14. The tubes 28 and 29 are substantially<br>
the same length. The process gas which provides cooling for the outer surface<br>
of intermediate tube 28 is able to be supplied via a conduit 30 to the annular<br>
space between tubes 27 and 28. An oxygen containing gas is able to be<br>
supplied via a conduit 31 to the annular space between tubes 28 and 29. Fuel<br>
is able to be supplied via a conduit 32 to the bore of tube 29. While not shown,<br>
a swirler device is provided in the space between tubes 28 and 29 adjacent to<br>
the lower tip end of lance 24, to impart a helical flow to the oxygen-containing<br>
gas and thereby enhance mixing of that gas and the fuel at the tip of lance 24.<br>
The fuel may be entrained in a carrier gas if it is a solid such as fine particulate<br>
coal. However, the fuel also may be a suitable hydrocarbon gas or liquid.<br>
On start-up with furnace 10, the lance 24 is lowered to a position in which its<br>
lower tip end is above the initially quiescent bath 14. With the supply of<br>
oxygen-containing gas via conduit 31 and fuel via conduit 32, the lance 24 is<br>
fired by igniting the resultant mixture of oxygen-containing gas and fuel issuing<br>
from the lower, tip end of the lance. The materials supplied through the lance<br>
for this combustion of the fuel are supplied at a high velocity which results in<br>
generation of a very strong jet and splashing of the slag of bath 14. The<br>
external surface of tube 28 below the lower end of tube 27 becomes covered<br>
with molten slag which is solidified to form a protective coating 34 (see<br>
enlarged insert A) by cooling of tube 28 by the oxygen-containing gas. If not<br>
previously commenced, a flow of the cooling gas via conduit 30 is commenced,<br><br>
with that gas issuing from the lower end of tube 27 to further cool the tube 28.<br>
The lance 24 then is lowered so that its lower, tip end is submerged in the<br>
slag, to provide ongoing submerged injection and combustion of fuel within the<br>
slag. The top-submerged injection generates substantial turbulence in the slag<br>
such that splashing of the slag continues, and intimate mixing of feed to the<br>
slag is able to be achieved. The furnace then is in a condition enabling a<br>
required pyrometallurgical process to be conducted. In the course of that<br>
process, a cooling gas can be supplied via conduit 30 to the space between<br>
tubes 27 and 28 so as to issue into a gas space 36 above the bath 14. The<br>
cooling gas further assists in cooling of the outer surface of tube 28 and<br>
maintenance of solid slag coating 34. The cooling gas may be a non-oxidising<br>
gas such as nitrogen, or it may be an oxygen-containing gas such as air.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2, the flowsheet shown illustrates a three stage process<br>
for recovery of lead from lead source material by TSL technology. The<br>
process has a SMELT stage, followed by a REDUCTION stage and finally by a<br>
FUMING stage. In the first, SMELT stage, the lead source material such as<br>
lead concentrate is smelted in a TSL furnace, such as a furnace 10 as shown<br>
in Figure 1. In the TSL furnace, the source material and flux material are fed to<br>
a slag bath and smelted by top-submerged lance injection of an oxygen<br>
containing gas and fuel, to generate turbulence in the slag and combustion of<br>
a mixture of the fuel and oxygen-containing gas.<br>
In the SMELT stage, the lead source material is fed together with lead recycle<br>
streams. These streams include lead-rich fume from the smelting and from the<br>
REDUCTION stage, and lead residues from the separate processing of zinc-<br>
rich fume from the FUMING stage. However, in addition to lead concentrate,<br>
the lead source material may include secondary lead sources including lead<br>
acid batteries and/or recycled lead containing metal. The SMELT stage is<br>
conducted under slightly oxidising conditions, at a temperature in the range of<br>
950°C to 1200°C, preferably 1000°C to 1100°C which depends on slag<br>
chemistry and on the grade of the source material.<br><br>
Apart from lead-rich fume, the SMELT stage produces lead bullion and a slag<br>
having a high content of lead, as lead oxide. Thus, smelting is conducted in<br>
the presence of slag forming fluxes. The recycle streams help to maximise the<br>
lead content of the feed streams and so increase the amount of lead reporting<br>
to the bullion.<br>
The bullion is tapped periodically from the furnace and despatched for refining.<br>
The lead rich fume is collected and recycled to the SMELT stage. The high<br>
lead slag, with for example approximately 30 to 50 wt% lead, is tapped when<br>
the smelting furnace reaches capacity. However, the slag either remains in the<br>
furnace used for smelting to enable further recovery of lead in the<br>
REDUCTION stage prior to tapping, or it is transferred, preferably while still in<br>
a molten state, to a second TSL furnace, also such as shown in Figure 1 in<br>
which the REDUCTION stage is conducted.<br>
The REDUCTION stage involves recovery of lead contained in the high lead<br>
slag from the SMELT stage, by top-submerged injection. For this, a reducing<br>
condition is maintained in the furnace by the addition of reductant coal and<br>
control of the lance injection conditions, specifically the oxygen to fuel ratio.<br>
The conditions result in reduction of lead oxide to metallic lead, to produce<br>
lead bullion, and leave a slag with a lower level of lead, for example about 5%<br>
lead. The lower level of lead in the slag requires that the slag reduction be<br>
carried out at a higher temperature, for example in the range 1200°C to<br>
1250CC, due to the increasing slag liquidus temperature.<br>
The products of the REDUCTION stage are lead bullion, a lead rich fume and<br>
a slag containing for example approximately 5% lead and a substantially<br>
higher level of zinc. The bullion is tapped and despatched for refining. The<br>
lead-rich fume is collected and recycled to the SMELTING stage to maximise<br>
direct recovery of lead to bullion. The high zinc slag, if not tapped from the<br>
furnace, stockpiled and processed separately, is left in the REDUCTION stage<br>
TSL furnace, or transferred to a further TSL or other furnace, for final recovery<br>
of metal values.<br><br>
The FUMING stage recovers the last metal values to oxide and produces a<br>
slag suitable for disposal or for use as, for example, a building material, slag<br>
cement or road building. To recover the metal values, the process operating<br>
temperature is increased to about 1300°C. The supply of reductant coal is<br>
continued from the previous REDUCTION stage and is added to the slag to<br>
produce a more strongly reducing bath condition. The coal rate is controlled to<br>
generate an oxygen potential which is sufficiently low, for example about 10"8<br>
atmospheres, to promote fuming of the volatile lead and zinc. These metals<br>
then are oxidised above the bath and the resultant fume is collected in a gas<br>
handling system associated with the furnace. Oxygen for oxidation of the lead<br>
and zinc vapours may be supplied to the furnace by the lance used for top<br>
submerged injection, such as via tube 27 in the case of a lance 24 as shown in<br>
Figure 1. However the oxygen alternatively may be supplied above the bath<br>
by an alternative device.<br>
The process illustrated in Figure 3, in broad overall form, is similar to that<br>
described with reference to Figure 2. Thus, description of Figure 3 will be<br>
limited to matters of difference. A principal and important difference is that the<br>
REDUCTION stage is conducted in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The REDUCTION stage again requires that a reducing condition is maintained<br>
in the TSL furnace by the addition of reductant and control of lance injection<br>
conditions, specifically the oxygen to fuel ratio. However, rather than use a<br>
carbonaceous reductant such as coal, a sulphidic material, such as detailed<br>
earlier herein but preferably lead sulphide concentrate is charged to the bath<br>
and reduces the lead oxide of the slag by the reactions of equations (6) to (9)<br>
detailed above.<br>
Thus, if the REDUCTION stage is in the same TSL furnace as used for a<br>
SMELT stage for lead source material comprising lead sulphide concentrate<br>
alone, the feeding of lead sulphide is able to be continued through these two<br>
successive stages. The transition between the stages is not marked by the<br>
cessation of feeding source material and the commencement of feeding of a<br>
different reductant material to the TSL furnace (as with the commencement of<br><br>
feeding reductant coal on cessation of feeding lead source material in the<br>
process of Figure 2). Rather, that transition is marked by a continuation of<br>
feeding source material and, without adding carbonaceous reduction, changing<br>
conditions such that, instead of the lead sulphide source material being<br>
oxidised to increase the lead content of the slag as in the SMELT stage, the<br>
source material in the REDUCTION stage reduces lead oxide in the slag to<br>
metallic lead which reports substantially to bullion. The change in conditions is<br>
achieved by ceasing the addition of oxygen for sulphide smelting reactions as<br>
well as reducing the ratio of oxygen to fuel that is supplied by top-submerged<br>
injection. At the same time the rate of addition of fuel is increased to raise the<br>
bath temperature from 950°C to 1200°C, preferably in the range 1000°C to<br>
1100°C in the SMELT stage to the range of 1200°C to 1250°C in the<br>
REDUCTION stage.<br>
The REDUCTION stage of Figure 3, relative to that stage of Figure 2, reduces<br>
greenhouse gas emissions by substantial avoidance of added carbonaceous<br>
reductant, such as coal, in the REDUCTION stage and hence by less reliance<br>
in the overall three stage process on carbonaceous reductant. Thus, carbon<br>
dioxide generation in the REDUCTION stage is substantially reduced, and<br>
occurs only to an extent determined by any carbonaceous content of the lead<br>
concentrate and the combustion of fuel. Also, again in the overall process of<br>
Figure 3, better separation of lead and zinc allows more efficient processing,<br>
while less dilution of feeds produces a higher direct recovery of lead.<br>
Additionally, use of lead sulphide as reductant results in the generation of<br>
sulphur dioxide, and sulphur in the offgas can be used to monitor the progress<br>
of the reactions of equations (6) to (9). Also, the lower tenor sulphur dioxide<br>
offgas produced in the REDUCTION stage according to the invention can be<br>
treated for sulphur dioxide recovery if not required to report directly to an acid<br>
plant.<br>
It is found that, in the REDUCTION stage of Figure 3, the level of lead in the<br>
slag can be reduced to a suitable level before sulphur accumulates in the<br>
bullion to an unacceptable level. Thus, for example, the level of lead in the<br>
slag can be reduced at least to about 5% before the level of sulphur dioxide in<br><br>
the offgas began to diminish, indicating that the reaction of equation (6) had<br>
ceased to be effective.<br>
With the process of the present invention being used in the reduction stage of<br>
a three stage process, the use of a single TSL furnace for all three stages is<br>
suitable for small annual tonnages. However, because of the level of<br>
recycling, such an operation requires sufficient holding capacity to incorporate<br>
fume produced during the slag reduction stage and the fume produced in the<br>
slag fume stage.<br>
A two furnace operation is suitable for medium size installations. In the<br>
example shown in Figure 4, TSL furnace A is used for the smelt stage, while<br>
TSL furnace B is used for the reduction and fume stages. In this configuration,<br>
furnace A can be operated in a continuous smelt mode with continual removal<br>
of lead and, once the furnace capacity has been reached, periodic tapping of<br>
slag. The slag tapped from furnace A is transferred to furnace B where the<br>
slag reduction stage is conducted as a batch operation. Once that batch<br>
operation has been completed and the resultant lead bullion has been tapped,<br>
the final slag cleaning of the fuming stage commences as the second batch<br>
operation in furnace B.<br>
In Figure 4, the reference numerals for each of TSL furnaces A and B indicate<br>
the same features as for furnace 10 shown in Figure 1. For furnace B, the<br>
"REDUCTANT" may be lead sulphide concentrate for the first batch operation<br>
of slag reduction for lead recovery, and carbonaceous reductant (preferably<br>
coal) for the second batch operation of slag fuming for zinc recovery.<br>
Continuous procedures are shown by solid lines, while batch process<br>
procedures are shown by broken lines.<br>
Operation during the three stages with the arrangement illustrated by Figure 4<br>
will be understood by the preceding description. However, Figure 4 also<br>
illustrates suitable offgas processing. For furnace A, the offgases pass to a<br>
cooling unit 40 in which heat energy is extracted. From unit 40, the gases<br>
pass to unit 42 for cleaning for removal of particulates, to collect lead rich<br><br>
fumes. After unit 42, the gases pass to unit 44 in which sulphur is captured.<br>
Finally, the gases pass to a stack 46 for discharge. For furnace B the<br>
processing for offgases from the slag reduction stage is shown in solid line,<br>
while that for the fuming stage is shown in broken line. In each case, the<br>
offgases are cooled in unit 50 and cleaned in unit 52. Lead rich fume is<br>
recovered from unit 52 during slag reduction by lead sulphide concentrate,<br>
while zinc rich fume is recovered from unit 52 during the slag fume stage. In<br>
the slag reduction stage, the gases from unit 52 pass to unit 44 for sulphur<br>
capture, and then to stack 46. However, in the fuming stage, the gases from<br>
unit 52 pass direct to stack 46 as they are substantially free of sulphur dioxide.<br>
The lead rich fume recovered from units 42 and 52 is recycled to furnace A.<br>
An alternative two furnace system is that shown in Figure 5. In this example<br>
both the smelt and reduction stages are conducted in Furnace A with Furnace<br>
B utilised for zinc removal in the fuming stage. The overall operation with the<br>
system of Figure 5 readily will be understood from the description of the<br>
system of Figure 4. Further description therefore will be limited to matters in<br>
which the system of Figure 5 differs from that of Figure 4.<br>
In Figure 5, the smelting stage and the slag reduction stage are conducted as<br>
successive batch operations in Furnace A. The slag tapped from furnace A at<br>
the end of the slag reduction stage is transferred to furnace B for final slag<br>
cleaning by the fuming stage. In the smelting stage lead sulphide concentrate<br>
(with secondaries, reverts, recycles) and fluxes are charged to furnace A, and<br>
smelted. At the end of the smelting stage, the changes for slag reduction are<br>
adopted. For this, the feeding of lead sulphidic concentrate and fluxes is<br>
continued, while the secondaries, reverts and recycles are discontinued. Also<br>
the oxygen content of the injected gas is adjusted to achieve the lower oxygen<br>
potential required during the slag reduction stage. During each of the smelting<br>
and slag reduction stages, offgases pass to cooling unit 40 and then to unit 42<br>
for cleaning and removal of particulates, to collect respective lead rich fumes.<br>
For each of the smelting and reduction stages, the gases then pass to unit 44<br>
for sulphure capture, and then to stack 46. During the slag fume stage, the<br><br>
offgases pass to unit 50 for cooling, then to unit 52 for recovery of zinc rich<br>
fume, and then to stack 46 without the need for sulphur capture.<br>
The lead rich fume recovered by unit 42 during the smelting stage, as well as<br>
the lead rich fume recovered by unit 42 during the slag reduction stage, is<br>
recycled to a further smelting stage in Furnace A.<br>
For a large-scale installation, a three furnace configuration using three TSL<br>
furnaces can be employed. Each of the three stages is able to be carried out<br>
continuously in a respective furnace. Liquid slag flows continuously via a weir<br>
and launder from the smelt stage furnace to the slag reduction stage furnace,<br>
and similarly from the latter furnace to the fume stage furnace. Lead bullion is<br>
removed from the smelting and slag reduction furnaces. The final discard slag<br>
from the fume furnace may be continuously tapped through a weir for disposal.<br>
With reference to Figure 6, there is shown a theoretical distribution of lead in<br>
the smelt stage of a process as illustrated in each of Figures 2 to 5, under<br>
equilibrium conditions using HSC Chemistry for Windows 5.1 (chemical<br>
reaction and equilibrium software available from SGE Software at<br>
www.sge.com). The data of Figure 6 is for a typical set of conditions for a<br>
given smelter and for one specific lead sulphide concentrate. Figure 6 shows<br>
the weight percent distribution of lead between slag, lead bullion and fume<br>
under those conditions, plotted against the volume of lance injected oxygen<br>
containing gas (at a given oxygen content) expressed in normal cubic metres<br>
per tonne of concentrate.<br>
Figure 6 shows that the smelt stage is sensitive to the amount of lance injected<br>
oxygen containing gas. In the case illustrated, a difference of 50 Nm3 per<br>
tonne of concentrate can mean the difference between 65% to 70% direct lead<br>
metal recovery.<br>
The equilibrium case illustrated by Figure 6 assumes substantially complete<br>
mixing of the slag, lead source material and top-submerged injected oxygen-<br>
containing gas. While that injection achieves a high level of turbulence in the<br><br>
slag, the bath is not at equilibrium as predicted by the model. There are a<br>
number of factors contributing to this, including:<br>
(a)	Injected gases contact only a small proportion of the total volume of<br>
the slag, and oxygen transfer throughout that volume is reliant on<br>
the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple to transfer oxygen from the injected<br>
gases to molten lead source material taken up in the slag.<br>
(b)	It has been found that faster mixing is achieved above the lance tip<br>
relative to mixing below that tip. Substantially complete mixing in<br>
slag above the tip may be achieved in about 2 minutes for example,<br>
whereas mixing below the tip may require up to about 20 minutes.<br>
(c)	If the lead sulphide concentrate and flux material are mixed or<br>
pugged, as is preferred, then as the pug falls into the bath and is<br>
heated up there is opportunity for solids to react with each other<br>
before they are dispersed in the slag and melted. The solids are in<br>
contact with gases, evolved from moisture and generated by<br>
smelting reactions before contact with oxygen-containing gas. As a<br>
consequence, the proportion of lead lost to fume may be less than<br>
would be the case under the equilibrium condition.<br>
(d)	Lead sulphide concentrates can be quite variable, including with<br>
respect to any graphitic carbon content. A large proportion of the<br>
oxygen demand during smelting can be due to this carbon source.<br>
Variations in the graphitic carbon content of the lead source material,<br>
such as by about 4 to 10 wt%, can impact on the ability to optimise<br>
control of the process with respect to oxygen.<br>
However, despite these factors, Figure 6 is indicative of the general level of<br>
distribution of lead in the smelt stage between slag, lead bullion and fume.<br>
Direct lead recovery in that stage is able to be optimised at, for example, about<br>
65 to 70%. Lead recovery in the overall three stage process is able to be<br>
stabilised at about 95%, with the use of a sulphidic material such as lead<br>
sulphide concentrate as reductant in the reduction stage being comparable to<br>
the prior art practice based on the use of a carbonaceous reductant such as<br><br>
coal. The remaining 5% lead is accounted for by lead in zinc rich fume<br>
produced in the fume stage and lead losses in discard slag from that stage.<br>
Figure 7 shows the effectiveness of, and benefits from, the use of a sulphidic<br>
material such as lead sulphide concentrate as reductant in the reduction stage.<br>
Figure 7 is a control chart showing the weight percentage of each of lead and<br>
zinc in the slag after successive time intervals during successive smelt,<br>
reduction and fume stages of a three stage process conducted in a single TSL<br>
furnace.<br>
In the period of the reduction stage of the process illustrated by Figure 7, the<br>
level of lead in the slag can be seen to drop rapidly, with the use of a sulphidic<br>
material, in this case a lead sulphide concentrate, as reductant adding to the<br>
quantity of zinc in the slag. This difference in reporting of lead and zinc, that is<br>
recovery of lead as bullion while the slag substantially retains and takes up<br>
further zinc, occurs to a significantly greater extent than when a carbonaceous<br>
reductant is used in the reduction stage. This results in a better separation of<br>
lead and zinc, with both the fume produced in the reduction stage being richer<br>
in lead and the fume produced in the fume stage being richer in zinc.<br>
Finally, it is to be understood that various alterations, modifications and/or<br>
additions may be introduced into the constructions and arrangements of parts<br>
previously described without departing from the spirit or ambit of the invention.<br>
An example of such a modification may be through the use of other sulphide<br>
bearing materials as the reductant, such as bulk concentrates, sulphide<br>
drosses and pyrites.<br><br>
