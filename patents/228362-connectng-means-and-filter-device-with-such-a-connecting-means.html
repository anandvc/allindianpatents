				<td>Connecting means and filter device with such a connecting means<br>
The invention relates to a connecting means for connecting two hydraulic<br>
elements, having a first pipe connecting piece, a second pipe connecting<br>
piece and a securing part, the two pipe connecting pieces being able to be<br>
connected to one another in a releasable and fluid-tight manner by means<br>
of the securing part.<br>
The invention also relates to a filter device with at least one connection<br>
line which can be connected to it, the filter device having a housing into<br>
which a filter unit for filtering a fluid, in particular a hydraulic fluid, can be<br>
inserted and the connection line being able to be connected to the housing<br>
in a releasable and fluid-tight manner.<br>
Such filter devices are used, for example, for filtering hydraulic oils in<br>
hydraulic systems. For this purpose, at least one connection line can be<br>
connected to the housing, allowing the hydraulic oil to be supplied to the<br>
housing or discharged from the housing. The filter device and the<br>
connection line form a connecting means having two pipe connecting<br>
pieces which can be connected to one another in a releasable and fluidtight<br>
manner. One of the two pipe connecting pieces may be formed on<br>
the housing of the filter device, whereas the other pipe connecting piece<br>
forms an end region of the connection line. It may be provided, for<br>
example, that a flexible hose line or a solid pipeline is connected to the<br>
pipe connecting piece of the connection line.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to configure a connecting means of<br>
the type mentioned at the beginning in such a way that the two pipe<br>
connecting pieces can be connected to one another and separated from<br>
one another in a simple way.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in the case of a<br>
connecting means of the generic type by the first pipe connecting piece<br>
having at least one recess on the outside, by the second pipe connecting<br>
piece having a collar and an outer piece of pipe, which between them<br>
form an annular space which is bounded on one side in the axial direction<br>
and accommodates a sealing element, the outer piece of pipe having at<br>
least one aperture and the first pipe connecting piece being able to be<br>
introduced into the annular space, and by the securing part having at<br>
least one catch element, which can be inserted into an aperture, thereby<br>
entering a recess.<br>
To establish a connection between the two pipe connecting pieces, all that<br>
is required is to introduce the first pipe connecting piece into the annular<br>
space of the second pipe connecting piece and subsequently insert the at<br>
least one catch element from outside into an aperture of the outer piece<br>
of pipe, it passing through the aperture and entering a recess of the first<br>
pipe connecting piece. In this way, a fluid-tight connection between the<br>
two pipe connecting pieces can be established in a very simple way. If<br>
the two pipe connecting pieces are to be separated from one another<br>
again, all that is required for this purpose is to remove the catch element<br>
from the aperture in the radial direction, thereby releasing the recess of<br>
the first pipe connecting piece, so that the latter can be pulled out from<br>
the annular space of the second pipe connecting piece.<br>
It is advantageous if the collar forms an inner piece of pipe of the second<br>
pipe connecting piece, which projects beyond the outer piece of pipe in<br>
the axial direction. In the case of such an embodiment, the second pipe<br>
connecting piece is of a double-walled configuration, with an outer piece<br>
of pipe and a projecting inner piece of pipe, which between them form the<br>
annular space. For insertion in the annular space, the first pipe<br>
connecting piece may be fitted onto the inner piece of pipe and<br>
subsequently introduced into the annular space in the axial direction. The<br>
inner piece of pipe may conically taper at its free end region, in order to<br>
simplify the fitting-on of the first pipe connecting piece.<br>
The securing part preferably has at least two diametrically opposed catch<br>
elements. This allows the mechanical load-bearing capacity of the<br>
connecting means to be increased.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, it may be provided that the securing part has<br>
at least two catch elements, disposed offset in relation to one another in<br>
the axial direction.<br>
Associated with each catch element on the outer piece of pipe is an<br>
aperture into which it can be inserted. It is of advantage in this respect if<br>
the respective catch element forms a positive engagement with the<br>
associated aperture. This ensures that the catch element inserted into<br>
the aperture is held immovably on the outer piece of pipe of the second<br>
pipe connecting piece.<br>
In the case of a preferred embodiment, the securing part has an<br>
elastically expandable sleeve, which can be fitted onto the outer piece of<br>
pipe and on the inside has the at least one securing element. As a result,<br>
the handling of the connecting means when establishing a releasable<br>
connection between the two pipe connecting pieces is simplified to a<br>
particular extent, since the sleeve can be fitted laterally onto the outer<br>
piece of pipe, the at least one catch element, which is disposed on the<br>
inside of the sleeve, passing through the associated aperture and entering<br>
a recess of the first pipe connecting piece. The elastic restoring force of<br>
the sleeve ensures that the catch element cannot be unintentionally<br>
released. This makes it possible to dispense with additional retaining<br>
means for the catch element.<br>
It is of advantage if the sleeve surrounds the outer piece of pipe only<br>
incompletely in the circumferential direction, since the fitting of the sleeve<br>
onto the outer piece of pipe is simplified as a result.<br>
It may be provided, for example, that the sleeve surrounds the outer<br>
piece of pipe in the circumferential direction over an angular range from<br>
approximately 210° to about 330°, preferably over an angular range from<br>
about 270° to approximately 330°. It has proven to be particularly<br>
advantageous if the sleeve surrounds the outer piece of pipe over an<br>
angular range of about 300°. By being configured in such a way that it<br>
surrounds the outer piece of pipe only incompletely, the sleeve has a<br>
discontinuity. For the fitting-on of the elastic sleeve, the latter can be<br>
placed laterally onto the outer piece of pipe in the region of its<br>
discontinuity and subsequently snapped into place on the outer piece of<br>
pipe, it lying in surface contact against the outer side of the outer piece of<br>
pipe and the at least one catch element disposed on the inside of the<br>
sleeve passing through an aperture of the outer piece of pipe and entering<br>
a recess of the first pipe connecting piece.<br>
It may be provided that the at least one catch element extends in the<br>
circumferential direction over virtually the entire inner side of the sleeve.<br>
However, it has proven to be advantageous if the at least one catch<br>
element extends in the circumferential direction only over a partial region<br>
of the sleeve. For example, it may be provided that the at least one catch<br>
element extends in the circumferential direction over an angular range<br>
from approximately 20° to about 50°, in particular over an angular range<br>
from approximately 25° to about 45°.<br>
It is of advantage if the at least one catch element is integrally connected<br>
to the sleeve. This makes low-cost production of the two parts possible.<br>
It may be provided that at least one catch element enters a recess of the<br>
first pipe connecting piece with positive engagement. Such a<br>
configuration ensures that the first pipe connecting piece cannot be<br>
displaced in the axial direction or in the circumferential direction with<br>
respect to the second pipe connecting piece.<br>
In many cases, it is of advantage if the two pipe connecting pieces can be<br>
turned in relation to one another in the circumferential direction while<br>
retaining their fluid-tight connection. In the case of a preferred<br>
embodiment, the at least one recess therefore extends in the<br>
circumferential direction over a greater annular range than the catch<br>
element entering the recess. In the axial direction, the catch element<br>
may form a positive engagement with a recess,' so that it is ensured that<br>
the two pipe connecting pieces are connected to one another immovably<br>
in the axial direction. By contrast with this, the two pipe connecting<br>
pieces can be turned with respect to one another in the circumferential<br>
direction if the recess extends over a greater angular range than the catch<br>
element.<br>
It may be provided, for example, that the at least one recess is configured<br>
as an annular groove encircling the pipe connecting piece in the<br>
circumferential direction.<br>
This makes it possible to turn the two pipe connecting pieces in relation to<br>
one another in the circumferential direction by 360° while retaining a<br>
fluid-tight connection.<br>
In the case of a preferred embodiment, interacting stops are disposed on<br>
the first and second pipe connecting pieces, the two pipe connecting<br>
pieces being able to turn with respect to one another in a first direction of<br>
rotation along their circumference when a specific torque is exceeded,<br>
with the stops being overcome, to limit the torque that can be transmitted<br>
from one of the two pipe connecting pieces to the other. In the case of<br>
such a configuration, the two pipe connecting pieces cannot be turned<br>
freely in relation to one another in the circumferential direction, but<br>
instead the stops butt against one another when the pipe connecting<br>
pieces are turned, so that a torque can be exerted on one of the two pipe<br>
connecting pieces, for example in order to screw a solid pipeline onto one<br>
of the pipe connecting pieces. If, however, the torque acting in a first<br>
direction of rotation exceeds a maximum admissible value, the stops lying<br>
against one another can be overcome, that is to say the stops slide along<br>
on one another and in this way permit a relative rotational movement of<br>
the two pipe connecting pieces in the first direction of rotation. As a<br>
result, the torque that can be transmitted from one pipe connecting piece<br>
to the other with respect to the first direction of rotation can be limited to<br>
a maximum value.<br>
The stops can preferably only be overcome when a specific torque is<br>
exceeded in the case of a relative rotational movement of the pipe<br>
connecting pieces in the first direction of rotation, while they cannot be<br>
overcome in the case of a rotational movement in the opposite direction<br>
of rotation. This has the advantage that, for example, a solid pipeline can<br>
be screwed onto one of the two pipe connecting pieces in a first direction<br>
of rotation, the torque that can be exerted by the pipeline from the pipe<br>
connecting piece during the screwing connection being limited, since the<br>
pipe connecting piece onto which the pipeline is screwed turns with<br>
respect to the other pipe connecting piece, to which it is connected, if a<br>
specific torque is exceeded. If, however, the screwed connection is<br>
released again, by the pipeline being turned in the opposite direction, the<br>
torque that can thereby be exerted by the pipeline on the pipe connecting<br>
piece is not restricted, since, with respect to this second direction of<br>
rotation, which is opposite to the first direction of rotation, the two pipe<br>
connecting pieces cannot be turned in relation to one another as a result<br>
of the interacting stops.<br>
It may be provided, for example, that the stops have a sawtooth-like<br>
cross-sectional profile. They may in each case have an end flank and an<br>
elongated longitudinal flank, sliding along on one another with their<br>
longitudinal flanks in the case of turning in the first direction of rotation,<br>
and the longitudinal flanks becoming increasingly clamped with respect to<br>
one another, so that an increasing torque is required for turning. If a<br>
maximum torque with respect to the first direction of rotation is exceeded,<br>
the clamping of the longitudinal flanks is abruptly released, so that the<br>
rotational movement can be continued, with the torque again increasing.<br>
This allows the two pipe connecting pieces to be turned in relation to one<br>
another, it only being possible for a restricted torque to be transmitted<br>
between the pipe connecting pieces. In the case of a rotational<br>
movement in the opposite direction, however, the two end flanks can butt<br>
against one another and represent an obstacle that cannot be overcome,<br>
so that there is no torque limitation with respect to this direction of<br>
rotation.<br>
It is of particular advantage if the stops have a longitudinal flank curved in<br>
the form of an evolute. It has been found that particularly effective<br>
torque limitation can be achieved in this way.<br>
In the case of a preferred embodiment, the interacting stops are disposed<br>
on the outer side of the inner piece of pipe and on the inner side of the<br>
first pipe connecting piece.<br>
It is advantageous if the first pipe connecting piece has a number of<br>
recesses disposed offset in relation to one another in the axial direction.<br>
It may be provided that a number of catch elements of the securing part<br>
enter a recess of the first pipe connecting piece.<br>
The sealing element is preferably configured as a sealing ring, which is<br>
disposed in the region of the closed end of the annular space between the<br>
first pipe connecting piece and the collar or the outer piece of pipe. In<br>
this way, it may be provided that, during insertion into the annular space,<br>
the free end region of the first pipe connecting piece can be pressed in<br>
between the sealing ring and the collar or the outer piece of pipe.<br>
Positioning of the sealing ring between the first pipe connecting piece and<br>
the collar has proven to be particularly advantageous.<br>
The sealing ring can preferably be fixed in the axial direction. For this<br>
purpose, it may be provided that it is disposed in the axial direction<br>
between a bottom wall of the annular space and an end wall portion of the<br>
first pipe connecting piece. It is of advantage if the end wall of the first<br>
pipe connecting piece forms a step, a radially outer end wall portion<br>
projecting in the direction of the second pipe connecting piece, and the<br>
sealing ring being able to be placed against a radially inner end wall<br>
portion of the first pipe connecting piece.<br>
The securing part is preferably produced from plastic, for example from<br>
polyamide.<br>
In the case of a preferred configuration, the two pipe connecting pieces<br>
are produced from plastic, it again being possible for polyamide to be<br>
used.<br>
The connecting means explained above is used in particular in the case of<br>
a filter device of the type mentioned at the beginning, which can be<br>
releasably connected to at least one connection line. For this purpose, it<br>
may be provided that the filter device and the at least one connection line<br>
form a connecting means of the type explained above.<br>
The housing of the filter device may have at least one first pipe<br>
connecting piece and/or at least one second pipe connecting piece, and<br>
the connection line that is respectively to be connected may be<br>
correspondingly configured with a second pipe connecting piece or with a<br>
first pipe connecting piece.<br>
An outer wall of the housing is preferably integrally connected to at least<br>
one first pipe connecting piece. For this purpose, it may be provided that<br>
the housing and the at least one first pipe connecting piece are produced<br>
from plastic. It is of particular advantage if the plastic is electrically<br>
conductive, since static charges of the housing can be avoided as a result.<br>
The following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
provides a more detailed explanation in conjunction with the drawing, in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a filter device with three<br>
connection lines connected to it;<br>
Figure 2 shows a pictorial representation of detail A from Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view along the line 3-3 in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 4 shows a sectional view along the line 4-4 in Figure 3 and<br>
Figure 5 shows a sectional view corresponding to Figure 4 of an<br>
alternative configuration.<br>
In Figure 1, a filter device 10 is schematically represented, having a twopart<br>
housing 12, which has a first housing part 13 and a second housing<br>
part 14. The two housing parts 13, 14 are screwed to one another by<br>
means of corresponding threads, which are not represented in the<br>
drawing. They accommodate a filter element 16, which comprises a filter<br>
material 17 that is folded in a star-shaped manner in the customary way<br>
and is covered at the ends by a first end plate 19 and a second end plate<br>
20. The first end plate 19 carries a bypass valve 22 in the customary<br>
way.<br>
In the embodiment represented, the filter device 10 is configured as a<br>
return flow filter and is known per se to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The housing is produced from plastic, to be precise from polyamide, and<br>
has two inlets 24, 26 and an outlet 25. To the inlets 24, 26 and the outlet<br>
25 there can be connected in each case a connection line 28, 30 and 29,<br>
respectively. The inlets 24, 26 and the outlet 25 are of an identical<br>
configuration. They have in each case a first pipe connecting piece 32.<br>
The connection lines 28, 30, 29 are also of an identical configuration, in<br>
each case comprising a second pipe connecting piece 33. The first and<br>
second pipe connecting pieces 32, 33 respectively associated with one<br>
another can be connected to one another in a releasable and fluid-tight<br>
manner, a securing part 34 in each case being used for securing the<br>
releasable connection. In Figure 1, the inlet 24, the outlet 25 and the<br>
connection lines 28 and 29 respectively associated with the latter as well<br>
as the respective securing part 34 are disposed offset in relation to one<br>
another, in order to illustrate the interaction of these parts, while the inlet<br>
26 and the associated connection line 30 are represented in the state in<br>
which they are connected to one another by means of the corresponding<br>
securing part 34.<br>
The interacting first and second pipe connecting pieces 32, 33 in<br>
combination with the respective securing part 34 form a connecting<br>
means 36, which is represented in detail in Figures 2, 3 and 4 and with<br>
the aid of which the inlets and outlets 24, 25, 26 can in each case be<br>
connected to a connection line 28, 29 and 30, respectively, in a releasable<br>
and fluid-tight manner.<br>
The first pipe connecting piece 32 has on the outside a number of annular<br>
grooves 38, which are disposed at equal intervals in relation to one<br>
another and in each case form a recess. At its free end, the first pipe<br>
connecting piece 32 has an inner groove 40, by which the free end wall of<br>
the first pipe connecting piece 32 is provided with a stepped configuration,<br>
with a radially outer first end wall portion 41 and a radially inner second<br>
end wall portion 42, which is disposed offset in relation to the first end<br>
wall portion 41 in the axial direction.<br>
The second pipe connecting piece 33 comprises an axially aligned collar in<br>
the form of an inner piece of pipe 45 and a coaxially aligned outer piece of<br>
pipe 46, which define between them an annular space 48, which is closed<br>
on the side remote from the first pipe connecting piece 32 by means of a<br>
bottom wall of a stepped configuration. The bottom wall has a radially<br>
outer first bottom wall portion 51 and a radially inner second bottom wall<br>
portion 52, which are connected to one another by means of a step 53.<br>
In the region of the bottom wall portions 51 and 52, the inner piece of<br>
pipe 45 and the outer piece of pipe 46 merge integrally with one another<br>
and together form a connection pipe 55, which in the embodiment<br>
represented protrudes at right angles from the second piece of pipe 33<br>
and to which, for example, a flexible hose line known per se can be<br>
connected.<br>
The outer piece of pipe 46 has a total of six apertures 57. Four of the<br>
apertures 57, diametrically opposed in twos, are disposed at the same<br>
level in the axial direction and evenly distributed in the circumferential<br>
direction of the outer piece of pipe 46. Two further apertures 57 are<br>
disposed offset in the axial direction and in the circumferential direction in<br>
relation to the remaining apertures 57 and are likewise diametrically<br>
opposed. The apertures 57 are configured in the form of slits and extend<br>
in the circumferential direction of the outer piece of pipe 26 over an<br>
angular range from approximately 35° to 40°.<br>
The annular space 48 accommodates a sealing ring 60, which surrounds<br>
the inner piece of pipe 45 in the circumferential direction and lies against<br>
the radially inner bottom wall portion 52, it only extending in the radial<br>
direction to the level of the step 53, so that an intermediate space<br>
remains free between the sealing ring 60 and the outer piece of pipe 46.<br>
As can be seen particularly clearly from Figures 3 and 4, the second pipe<br>
connecting piece 33 can be fitted onto the first pipe connecting piece 32,<br>
the first pipe connecting piece 32 entering the annular space 48. The<br>
inner piece of pipe 45 projects in the axial direction beyond the outer<br>
piece of pipe 46. This facilitates the insertion of the first pipe connecting<br>
piece 32 into the annular space 48. The free end region of the first pipe<br>
connecting piece 32 enters the intermediate space between the sealing<br>
ring 60 and the outer piece of pipe 46, so that the sealing ring 60 lies with<br>
its end face, remote from the second bottom wall portion 52, against the<br>
second end wall portion 42 of the first pipe connecting piece 32. The<br>
thickness of the sealing ring 60 is chosen such that, when the first pipe<br>
connecting piece 32 is inserted into the annular space 48, it is pressed<br>
with a fluid-tight effect by the end region of the first pipe connecting piece<br>
32 and by the circumferential region of the inner piece of pipe 45 that is<br>
adjacent the second bottom wall portion 52.<br>
The apertures 57 of the outer piece of pipe 46 are disposed in the axial<br>
direction in such a way that they are in each case in line with an annular<br>
groove 38 when the first pipe connecting piece 32 is inserted in the<br>
annular space 48.<br>
The securing element 34, which comprises a sleeve 64 extending in the<br>
circumferential direction over an angular range of approximately 300°, is<br>
used for the axial fixing of the two pipe connecting pieces 32, 33. The<br>
sleeve 64 has on the inside a total of six catch elements in the form of<br>
radially inwardly directed projections 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, which are in<br>
each case associated with an aperture 57 of the outer pipe connecting<br>
piece 46.<br>
Since the sleeve 64 extends in the circumferential direction only over a<br>
partial region of the outer piece of pipe 46, with its free ends it defines a<br>
clearance 73 in the circumferential direction. The clearance 73 is<br>
respectively adjoined on the inner side of the sleeve 64 by a projection 66<br>
and 67, which has directly adjacent the clearance 73 a radially extending<br>
first side edge 74 and a second side edge 75, which is remote from the<br>
first side edge 74 and runs in a colinear manner in relation to a secant 78<br>
aligned perpendicularly in relation to the angle bisector 77 of the<br>
clearance 73.<br>
The projections 66, 67, 68 and 69 are disposed at the same level in the<br>
axial direction, the projection 69 being located diametrically opposite the<br>
projection 66 and being configured mirror-symmetrically in relation to the<br>
projection 66 with respect to a center axis 80 of the sleeve 64. In a<br>
corresponding way, the projection 68 lies diametrically opposite the<br>
projection 67 and is configured mirror-symmetrically in relation to the<br>
projection 67 with respect to the center axis 80.<br>
The projections 70 and 71 are disposed offset in relation to the<br>
projections 66 to 69 axially in the direction of the free end of the second<br>
pipe connecting piece 33 and centrally between the projections 66 and 68<br>
or 67 and 69 in the circumferential direction, and are likewise aligned<br>
mirror-symmetrically in relation to one another with respect to the center<br>
axis 80, having radially extending first and second side edges 82 and 83,<br>
respectively.<br>
With the clearance 73, the securing pipe 34 can be placed laterally against<br>
the outer piece of pipe 46 of the second pipe connecting piece 33. Being<br>
formed from plastic material allows it subsequently to be snapped into<br>
place on the outer piece of pipe 46, by the sleeve 64 radially expanding<br>
and subsequently contracting again in the radial direction, the projections<br>
66 to 71 in each case reaching through an associated aperture 57 of the<br>
outer piece of pipe 46 and entering one of the annular grooves 38 of the<br>
first pipe connecting piece 32. The first pipe connecting piece 32 is<br>
thereby held non-displaceably in the axial direction on the second pipe<br>
connecting piece 33, while the two pipe connecting pieces 32 and 33 can<br>
be turned with respect to one another in the circumferential direction,<br>
without the fluid-tight connection of the two pipe connecting pieces 32, 33<br>
being impaired as a result. This makes it possible when fitting the filter<br>
device 10 and the connection lines 28, 29, 30 in an installation space to<br>
align the connection lines 28, 29 and 30 optimally in relation to the filter<br>
device 10 in a way corresponding to the space available.<br>
If the connection between the pipe connecting pieces 32 and 33 is to be<br>
released again, all that is required for this purpose is to detach the<br>
securing part 34 laterally from the outer piece of pipe 46 of the second<br>
pipe connecting piece 33, by the sleeve 64 being radially expanded.<br>
Consequently, by means of the securing part 34, a fluid-tight connection<br>
between the pipe connecting pieces 32 and 33 can be established and also<br>
separated again in a simple way and without the assistance of an<br>
additional tool.<br>
As already explained, in the case of the embodiment explained in detail<br>
above, the two pipe connecting pieces 32, 33 can be freely turned in<br>
relation to one another in the circumferential direction. Schematically<br>
represented in Figure 5 is an alternative configuration, which is largely<br>
identical to the embodiment described in detail above, as it is illustrated in<br>
Figures 1 to 4. Therefore, reference numerals identical to those in Figures<br>
1 to 4 are used for the same components in Figure 5. To avoid repetition,<br>
in this respect reference is made to the explanations given above.<br>
The configuration that is schematically shown Figure 5 differs from the<br>
embodiment that is represented in Figures 1 to 4 in that the first pipe<br>
connecting piece 32 has on its inner side a number of radially inwardly<br>
directed stops 86, which are disposed evenly distributed in the<br>
circumferential direction and have a sawtooth-like profile, with an end<br>
flank 87 which is inclined obliquely in relation to the radial direction and is<br>
adjoined in the circumferential direction by an elongated longitudinal flank<br>
88 curved in the form of an evolute. Altogether, the first pipe connecting<br>
piece 32 has six stops 86, disposed at equal angular intervals in relation<br>
to one another. Corresponding stops 90 are disposed at equal intervals in<br>
relation to one another on the outer side of the inner piece of pipe 45.<br>
However, the inner piece of pipe 45 has only three stops 90, these<br>
likewise having an end flank which is inclined obliquely in relation to the<br>
radial direction and is adjoined by an elongated longitudinal flank in the<br>
form of an evolute.<br>
If, in the case of the embodiment that is represented in Figure 5, the two<br>
pipe connecting pieces 32, 33 are turned with respect to one another in a<br>
first direction of rotation, the mutually facing end faces of the associated<br>
stops 86 and 90 being moved away from one another, there is a turning<br>
movement counter to the resistance of the longitudinal flanks 88 curved<br>
in the form of an evolute sliding on one another, which become<br>
increasingly clamped with respect to one another. The resistance, and<br>
consequently the torque required for the rotational movement,<br>
consequently becomes increasingly greater. If, however, the torque<br>
acting with respect to the first direction of rotation is increased beyond a<br>
maximum value, the end flanks 87 of the stops 86, 90 that are inclined<br>
obliquely in relation to the radial direction slide along on one another in<br>
the first direction of rotation and thereby release the longitudinal flanks<br>
88 again, that is to say the stops 86, 90 can be overcome in the first<br>
direction of rotation, and consequently only a limited torque can be<br>
transmitted between the pipe connecting pieces 32 and 33 with respect to<br>
the first direction of rotation. If the two pipe connecting pieces 32, 33 are<br>
turned with respect to one another in the second direction of rotation,<br>
opposite to the first direction of rotation, the mutually facing end faces 87<br>
of the stops 88, 90 butt against one another, that is to say the stops 86,<br>
90 cannot be overcome in the second direction of rotation.<br>
Such an embodiment is of advantage in particular whenever, for example,<br>
the second pipe connecting piece 33 is part of a connection element which<br>
can be screwed on its side remote from the first pipe connecting piece 32<br>
to a line part, for example a solid pipeline, which is aligned coaxially in<br>
relation to the second pipe connecting piece 33. During the screwing of<br>
the line part onto the connection element, the connection element<br>
experiences a torque with respect to the first direction of rotation and can<br>
be supported on the first pipe connecting piece 32 via the second pipe<br>
connecting piece 33 by means of the stops 86 and 90. If, however, the<br>
torque acting exceeds a maximum value, the first pipe connecting piece<br>
32 releases the second pipe connecting piece 33 in the first direction of<br>
rotation, that is to say the two pipe connecting pieces 32, 33 can be<br>
turned with respect to one another, and this in turn ensures that, when<br>
the line part is screwed onto the connection element, the latter cannot be<br>
damaged as a result of an inadmissibly high torque. If the screw<br>
connection is released again, by the line part being turned in the second<br>
direction of rotation, opposite to the first direction of rotation, the second<br>
pipe connecting piece 33 can be supported on the first pipe connecting<br>
piece 32 via the stops 86, 90 which cannot be overcome in this direction<br>
of rotation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
