				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of the invention relates to highly pure ropinirole or salt thereof and a process for preparing highly pure ropinirole of structural Formula I,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ropinirole of Formula-I chemically known as 4-[2-(di-n-propylammo)-ethyl]-2(3H)-indolone and is useful in the treatment of Parkinsons disease. Ropinirole has been first disclosed in US patent 4,452,808.<br>
In general, the synthetic approach reported in the literature for the preparation of Ropinirole involves the reduction of 2-mtro-6-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyl)-phenylacetic acid hydrochloride of Formula II followed by in situ cyclization.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
There are significant drawbacks to this approach as the reduction of nitro group of 2-nitro-6-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyl)-phenyl acid hydrochloride of formula II to the corresponding amino compound 2-amino-6-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyl)-phenylacetic acid of Formula III or salt thereof,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
and further conversion to ropinirole results in the formation of many impurities, of which the following impurities along with other unidentified impurities are difficult to remove:<br>
a)	4-[2-(n-propylamino)-ethyl]-2(3-H)-indolone or salt thereof<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
b)	2-amino-6-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyl)-phenylacetic acid or salt thereof<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
c)        4-[2-(di-n-propylamino)-ethyl]-2(3-ethyl)-indolone or salt thereof CH2-CH2-N(C3H7)2<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
d)         4-[2-(di-n-propylamino)-ethyl] 1 H-indole-2,3 -dione (Formula Removed) <br><br>
These impurities are further carried into ropinirole.The prior art approach is not suitable from commercial point of view because the desired ropinirole is not obtained in high purity and requires purification by tedious and cumbersome purification processes. The presence of significant quantity of unreacted amino compound in final product even after using 100 times by volume of acetonitrile for recrystallization makes the process uneconomical and unviable.<br>
The inventors have observed that during the cyclization of amino compound of formula III, only 80-85% conversion of amino compound is achieved. The unreacted amino compound leads to formation of impurities which are very difficult to remove from ropinirole. In order to achieve a high efficiency of the reaction for industrial synthesis of ropinirole, it is necessary to increase the conversion of amino compound and minimizes the formation of impurities.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of highly pure ropinirole where starting material converts to final product in more than 97%<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one general aspect there is provided a highly pure ropinirole or a salt thereof.<br>
In another general aspect there is provided substantially pure ropinirole or a salt thereof having amino compound less than 0.05%.<br>
In another general aspect there is provided highly pure ropinirole or a salt thereof having impurity (a) and (c) each less than 0.05%.<br>
In another general aspect there is provided highly pure ropinirole or a salt thereof having total impurities less than 0.15 %.<br>
In another general aspect there is provided a process for the preparation of substantially pure ropinirole or a salt thereof. The process includes reducing nitro compound of Formula II with a reducing agent to produce amino compound of Formula III, cyclizing the resulting amino compound in situ using palladium on carbon in the presence of aqueous alcoholic medium and isolating the substantially pure ropinirole or a salt thereof by simple isolation method of extraction and acid base treatment. The reducing agent may be palladium on carbon.<br>
The details of one or more embodiments of the inventions are set forth in the description below. Other features, objects and advantages of the inventions will be apparent from the description and claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have developed an efficient process for the preparation of substantially pure ropinirole or a salt thereof, by reducing nitro compound of Formula II with a reducing agent to produce amino compound, 2-amino-6-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyl)-phenylacetic acid of Formula III and cyclizing in situ the amino compound of Formula III in aqueous alcoholic medium and isolating substantially pure ropinirole or a salt thereof by simple isolation method of extraction and acid base treatment.<br>
In general, the 2-nitro-6-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyl)-phenylacetic acid hydrochloride of formula II may be treated with a reducing agent in the presence of alcoholic solvent. The reaction is performed in an autoclave at a temperature<br>
between 25° -50°C and preferably at 35° -40°C under hydrogen pressure of 3.0 kg/cm2 for 5 hours. It is advantageous to add some water in the reaction mass to complete cyclization of the resulting amino compound i.e. up to 98% conversion. The progress of reaction is monitored by HPLC.<br>
The reducing agent includes any reducing agent which is capable of carrying out the reduction of the nitro group, including, for example, palladium on carbon, and the like and preferably palladium on carbon is used.<br>
The alcoholic solvent may include one or more of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohol having from one to six carbon atoms. The alcoholic solvent may include one or more of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, n-butanol and t-butanol. In particular, the alcoholic solvent is preferably ethanol. Mixtures of all of these solvents are also contemplated.<br>
After completion of reaction, solvent (aqueous alcohol) is removed under vacuum and product may be slurred in acetonitrile, isopropyl ether, ethyl acetate and chlorinated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform and the like. Further the resulting solid (crude ropinirole) may take in water and basified with sodium hydroxide and product is extracted in organic solvent such as isopropyl ether, ethyl acetate and chlorinated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform and the like. The organic layer is optionally distilled to 60-70% with respect to its original volume. The hydrochloride salt of Ropinirole is prepared by treating the organic layer with ethanolic-HCl at ambient temperature. The product is isolated in high purity and high yield. The compound can be optionally recrystallized from alcohol to improve colour if required. The product so obtained is having purity greater than 99.5% by HPLC, and preferably greater than 99.8%. The major advantages realized in the present invention are:<br>
•    High purity<br>
•	Completion of cyclization reaction up to 97%<br>
•	Avoid use of costly solvent for recrystallization.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are provided merely to be exemplary of the inventions and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Certain modifications and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
