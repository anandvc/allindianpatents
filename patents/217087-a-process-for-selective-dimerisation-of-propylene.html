				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for selective dimidiation of propylene principally into branched dimers. More particularly, it relates to a process in which propylene is brought into contact with a catalytic composition resulting from at least partly dissolving a nickel compound mixed or complexed with a tertiary phosphate carrying a functional group in a medium resulting from mixing at least one quaternary ammonium halide and/or at least one quaternary phosphonium halide, at least one aluminum halide and optionally at least one organometallic aluminum compound.<br>
French patent FR-B-2 611 700 describes the use of liquids of ionic nature formed from aluminium halides and quaternary ammonium halides as solvents for organometallic nickel complexes to catalyse olefin dimidiation. The use of such media, which are not miscible with aliphatic hydrocarbons, in particular with the products from olefin dimidiation, enables homogeneous catalysts to be used more effectively. French patent FR-B-2 659 871 describes a liquid composition with an ionic nature resulting from bringing quaternary ammonium halides and/or quaternary phosphonium halides into contact with alkylaluminium dihalides and optionally also an aluminium trlbalide. That same patent describes the use of such media as solvents for transition metal complexes, in particular nickel complexes containing no nickel-carbon bond, which are transformed into catalysts for olefin oligomerisation. In the present text, such media will henceforth be termed "molten salts" as they are liquid at moderate temperatures.<br>
During those studies, it was shown that the most active and most stable nickel catalysts are obtained in "molten salts" constituted by one molar equivalent of an ammonium halide and/or a phosphonium halide with one equivalent and more of an aluminium trialed, and optionally any quantity of an alkyl aluminium dihalide. That formulation has been shown to be particularly interesting as nickel complexes dissolved in it have high catalytic activity.<br>
Further, it has been shown that under the conditions described in French patent FR-B-2 611 700, the "phosphate effect", as described by G. Wilke et al., in Ind. Eng. Chem., 1970,<br><br>
62, No. 12, p. 34, and in United Kingdom patent GB-B-1 058 680, which reports the influence of substations carried by the phosphorus atom on the mode of enchainment of propylene molecules during catalytic dimidiation by nickel, rapidly disappears over time. That unexplained phenome¬non has deleterious consequences since it does not produce the desired selectivity’s.<br>
FR-B 2 710 280 shows that adding an aromatic hydrocarbon to a "molten salt" can overcome this problem and result in catalysts with high activity which are more stable and which have a high selectivity for the most highly branched isomers. However, the aromatic hydrocarbon is conti¬nuously extracted in the organic phase constituted by the products, which implies that it must be separated and recycled to the reactor.<br>
It has now been discovered that the use of a tertiary phosphine carrying a functional group or a nickel complex formed with a tertiary phosphine that is soluble in the "molten salt" results in catalysts for which the selectivity for the most highly branched isomers is high and stable over time and for which the activity is high.<br>
The invention provides a process for selective dimidiation of propylene into branched dimers in which a catalytic composition comprising at least one nickel compound mixed or complexed with at least one tertiary phosphine carrying a functional group is used, at least partly dissolved in a non aqueous medium with an ionic nature ("molten salt" type medium), resulting from bringing at least one aluminium halide (product B) into contact with at least one quaternary ammonium halide and/or at least one quaternary phosphonium halide (product A), the "molten salt" type medium possibly further comprising at least one organometallic aluminium compound (product C).<br>
Thus the "molten salt" type medium, in which the nickel compound mixed or complexed with at least one tertiary phosphine carrying a functional group or at least one phosphite carrying a function group is dissolved, is constituted by mixing:<br><br>
a)	at least one quaternary ammonium and/or quaternary phosphonium halide, more<br>
particularly a chloride and/or bromide (product A);<br>
b)	at least one aluminium halide (product B); and<br>
c)	optionally, at least one organometallic aluminium compound (product C). Preferred quaternary ammonium and/or phosphonium halides which can be used within the<br>
context of the invention (product A) are:<br>
•	those with general formula NR1R2R3R4X (with the exception of NH4X), PR1R2R4X, R1R2N=CR3R4X or R1R2P=CR3R4X, where X represents Cl or Br and R1, R2 R3 and R4 which may be identical or different, each represent hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl residue containing I to 12 carbon atoms, for example saturated or unsaturated alkyl, cycloalkyl or aromatic groups, aryl groups or aurally groups, containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, it being understood that preferably, only one of substituents R1 R2, R3 and R4 represents hydrogen;<br>
•	or one of the following general formulae:<br><br>
where the nitrogen-containing or phosphorus-containing heterocyclic containing 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen and/or phosphorus atoms are constituted by 4 to 10 atoms and X, R1 and R2 are defamed as above.<br>

These salts can be used alone or as a mixture.<br><br>
The aluminium halides used as products B of the invention are essentially aluminium chloride and bromide.<br>
The organometallic aluminium compounds used as optional products C of the invention have general formula AlR3Xs-x in which R is a linear or branched alkyl residue containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms, X is chlorine or bromine and the value of x is 1, 2 or 3. Examples of organometallic aluminium compounds that can be used are isobutylaluminium sesquichloride, ethylaluminium sesquichloride, dichloroisobulyl aluminium, dichloroethyl aluminum and chlorodiethyl aluminium.<br>
The components of the "molten salts" as defined above are generally used in A:B mole ratios of1:0.5 to 1.3, preferably V.l to l;2; product C is used in a mole ratio of at most lOO:l with product B, preferably 0.005:1 to 10:1. However, the components and their proportions must be such that the mixture is liquid at the temperature at which the nickel compound and the functionalized tertiary phosphine are introduced, although the catalytic dimidiation reaction can be carried out at a temperature that is lower than or higher than the fusion temperature of the catalytic composition.<br>
Examples of nickel compounds used in the catalytic compositions of the invention are the chloride, bromide, sulphate, carboxylates (for example the 2-ethylhexanoate), phonates and acetyl actuate. It is also possible to use organometallic nickel complexes which may or may not contain phosphates. These nickel complexes are used as a mixture with a functionalized tertiary phosphine. It is also possible to use nickel complexes that are already complexed with a tertiary phosphine carrying a function.<br>
The functional phosphines used as a mixture with (or to complex) the nickel compounds of the invention have general formulae PR1,R"2R"3 and R"lR"2P-R"-PR"1R"2, where R"l, R"2 and R"3. which may be identical or different, are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or a alkyl radicals containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms at least one of which carries a functional group such as an amine, a cyclic amine, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, an ester, an acid, an alcohol, a quaternary ammonium, a quaternary<br><br>
phosphonium, a sulphorvium, a sulphonate or a propionate and R1" is a divalent aliphatic residue containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
The functional phosphines can be selected from compounds containing pyridine or imidazole substituents or their quarterlies derivatives containing pyridinium or imidazolium substituents that satisfy formulae 1 to 7 defined below.<br>
Examples of functional phosphines carrying a pyridine substitute are 2-dicyclopentyl-phosphinoethyl-4-pyridine with formula (1), 2-dicyclopentyIphosphinoethyl-2-pyridine with formula (2), 2-diisobutylphosphinoethyl-4-pyridine with formula (lb), 2-diisopropylphosphinoethyl-4-pyridine with formula (4) and their quantification derivatives with formula (3), where R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms and X is a weakly co-ordinating anion. Examples of weakly co-ordinating anions which can be cited are tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophoshate, tetrachloroaluminate, hexafluoroantimonate, carboxylate anions such as acetate, trifluoroacetate, trifluorosulphonate, and the anions N(CF3SO2)2 and C(CF3S02)3. Examples of quantification derivatives are 2-dicyclopenlylphosphinoethyl-N-ethyl pyridinium tetrafluoroborate with formula (3a), or 2-dicyclopentylphosphinoethyl-N-ethyl pyridinium chloride with formula (3b).<br>
Examples of functional phosphines carrying an imidazole subsistent which can be cited are 2-dicyclopentylphosphinoethyl-N-imidazole with formula (5), 2-diisopropylphosphinoethyI-N-imidazole with formula (7), 2-diisobutylphosphinoethyl-N-imida2ole with formula (7b) and their quantification derivatives with formula (6), where R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms and X is a weakly co-ordinating anion (as defined above), such as 2-dicyclopentyl-phosphinoethyl-1-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate with formula (6a).<br><br><br>
As examples of nickel compounds that can be used to constitute the catalytic compositions of the invention can be cited the complex con:^)lexes [NiCl2, 1.5P(2-dicyclopentylethyl-4-pyridine)]2, [NO2Cl2,] 2P(2-dicyclopentyIethyl-N-ethyl pyridinium tetrafluoroborate)], [Ni2Cl4, (2-dicycIopentyl-phosphinoethyl-N-ethyl pyridinium tetrafluoroborate)3, I.5CH2CI2], Ni2Cl4 2 pyridine mixed with at least one equivalent of functionalized tertiary phosphine or functionalized phosphate, nickel chloride mixed with at least one equivalent of 2-dicyclopentylphosplunoethyl-4-pyridine, nickel acetate mixed with at least one equivalent of 2-dicyclopentylphosphinoethyl-4-pyridine, nickel (2-ethyl<br><br>
hexameter) doctorate mixed with at least one equivalent of 2-dicyclopentylphosphinoethyl-4-pyridine and 2-dicyclopentylphosphinoethyI-4-pyridine x-ally nickel chloride.<br>
The compounds forming part of the catalytic composition of the invention can be mixed in any order. The mixture can be produced by simply bringing them into contact followed by agitation until a homogeneous liquid is formed. This mixture can be produced outside the dimidiation or oligomerisation reactor or, as is preferable, in the reactor.<br>
The propylene which undergoes the selective dimidiation of the invention can be used pure or diluted in an alkane, such as those found in C3 cuts from oil refining processes, such as catalytic cracking or steam cracking.<br>
The catalytic propylene demyelization reaction can be carried out in a closed system, in a semi-open system or continuously, with one or more reaction stages. Vigorous agitation must be carried out to ensure good contact between the reactant or reactants and the catalytic mixture. The reaction temperature can be from 40°C to +70°C, preferably -20°C to+50°C It is possible to operate above or below the fusion temperature of the medium, the dispersed solid stale not being a limitation to the proper conduct of the reaction. The heat engendered in the reaction can be eliminated using any means known to the skilled person. The pressure can be from atmospheric pressure to 20 MPa, preferably atmospheric pressure to 5 MPa. The reaction products and the reactant or reactants which has/have not reacted are separated from the catalytic system simply by decanting, then fractionation.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting its scope. EXAMPLE 1: Preparation of ionic solvent<br>
17.5 g(0.1 mole) of l-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride, 16.3 g (0.122 mole) of sublimed aluminium chloride, 1.6 g (0.0126 mole) of dichloroethyl aluminium was mixed at ambient temperature. A liquid was obtained.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2: Preparation of the complex [NiC2, 1.5 P(2-dicycIopentyIethyI-4-pyridine)]2<br>
2.37 g of NiCl2, 6H20 and 10 ml of absolute methanol were introduced into a Schlenk tube maintained under an argon atmosphere. After the nickel salt had dissolved, 20 ml of pentane was added. The 2 phases were agitated and 5.33 g of tertiary phosphine with formula (1) (20 moles) was added. After 2 hours agitation, the red precipitate was filtered. 5.82 g was obtained. Elemental analysis corresponded to the complex with formula [NiCl2, 1.5 P(2-dicyclopentylethyl-4-pyridine)]2 (M = 1085 g; 10.7% by weight of Ni).<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Quantification of pyridine in the complex described in Example 2<br>
3.72 g of the complex described in Example 2 was placed in a Schlenk lube and dichloromethane was added. Then a solution of tetrafluoroborate oxonium in diehloromethane (2.14 g of Et3O+BF4) was added dropwise. It was agitated for 4 hours, at the end of which period a red solution was obtained. The solvent was evaporated off and 20 ml of ether was added. The red crystalline solid obtained was filtered off. 4.56 g was obtained. Elemental analysis corresponded to the complex with formula: (P-N+EtBF4+)3, 1.5CH2Cl2, where P-N is the legend with formula (1).<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Propylene dimidiation<br>
A glass reactor provided with a temperature sensor, a magnetic bar in the lower stage (20 ml volume) to ensure proper agitation and a double envelope for circulating a cooling liquid was purged of air and moisture and maintained at an atmospheric pressure of 99% pure propylene. 0.03 mmole of the complex prepared in Example 2 (0.06 mmole of Ni) was introduced then the temperature was reduced to lO°C and 5 ml of the liquid composition prepared above (Example 1) was injected using a syringe, along with 7 ml of heptane. Agitation was commenced and immediately, propylene absorption was observed. When the non-agitated upper stage was full of liquid, the major portion of the hydrocarbon phase had been extracted. The reaction was stopped after 7 hours (5 extractions). At that time, 175 kg of products per gram of Ni had been produced.   Analysis of the different<br><br>
fractions showed that they were composed of 77% of dimers. The composition of the dimers, which was practically identical in all of the fractions, was 67% of 2,3-dimelhyIbutenes, and 29% of methyl pentanes, the remainder being n-hexane’s.<br>
EXAMPLE 5: Propylene dimidiation<br>
The procedure of Example 4 was carried out, with the exception that the molten salt prepared for this purpose was used, and that 0.05 mmole of nickel (2-ethylhexanoate) octoate and 0.5 mmole of 2-dicyclopentylphosphinoethyl-4-pyridine were introduced. The reaction period was 7 hours 15 minutes, at the end of which 5 fractions had been extracted and 220 kg of products per gram of Ni had been produced. The dimer selectivity was 78%. The selectivity for 2,3-dimethylbutenes was 66% in the first fraction and 63% in the final fraction.<br>
EXAMPLE 6: Propylene dimidiation<br>
The procedure of Example 4 was followed, with the exception that the molten salt for this purpose was used, and that 45 mg of the complex prepared in Example 3 was introduced. The reaction period was 7 hours 15 minutes, at the end of which 5 fractions had been extracted and 117 kg of products per gram of Ni had been produced, The dimer selectivity was 74-79%. The selectivity for 2,3-dimethylbutenes was 65% and was constant for the various fractions. EXAMPLE 7 (comparative): Propylene dimerisation<br>
The procedure of Example 4 was followed, with the exception that the molten salt used was that prepared in Example 1, introducing 0.05 mmole of the complex NiCl2, 2P(cyclohexyl)3. The reaction was left for 8 hours 30 minutes, at the end of which 10 fractions had been extracted. 137 kg of products per gram of Ni were produced, with a dimer selectivity of 83%. The selectivity for 2,3-dimethylbutenes was 70% in the first fraction; it dropped to 35% in the third and to 10% in the sixth fraction. It was 6% in the tenth fraction.<br><br><br>
