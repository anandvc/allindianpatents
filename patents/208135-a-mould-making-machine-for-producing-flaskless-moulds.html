A MOULD MAKING MACHINE FOR PRODUCING FLASKLESS MOULDS   TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a mould making machine for producing flaskless moulds.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Document EP-0,468,355 discloses a conventional moulding forming machine of the above-mentioned type. This moulding machine is of a type in which a cope flask, a pattern plate and a drag flask are capable of rotating over an angle of 90 between a horizontal position and a vertical position. The horizontal position is associated with inserting the pattern plate between the cope- and drag flask before the sand charging and compacting step and is associated with the removing of the pattern plate and the discharging of the cope and drag after the charging and compacting step. The sand charging and compacting step is performed with the cope flask, drag flask and pattern plate in the vertical position. The prior art moulding machine uses a first squeeze plate for compacting the sand in the cope flask (the upper flask by definition) and a second squeeze plate for compacting the sand in the drag flask (the lower flask by definition). The second squeeze plate is inserted into the drag flask when the latter is in the vertical position. Because of the rotating movement of the drag flask with respect to the fixed second squeeze plate, it is difficult to align the drag flask with the second squeeze plate in a precise and reproducible manner. The exact alignment in the prior art machine has to be carried out by the compression frame, which has already another important function, namely the transmission of the force for compacting the sand from one squeeze plate to the other. Therefore, the above described second squeeze plate cannot always be smoothly introduced into the drag flask due to deviations in the alignment of the two components.<br><br>
2<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a moulding machine for producing flaskless moulds of the kind referred to above, with which it is possible to overcome the disadvantages mentioned above and which allows easier alignment of the second squeeze plate with the drag flask, thus resulting in a simpler construction of the components of the machine and in higher quality drags and copes. With the arrangement, as provided by the present invention the alignment function of the compression frame is transferred to a swing frame which takes care of all alignment, whereas the compression frame is only constructed to transmit the relatively large forces related to the compacting of the sand. Thus, the second squeeze plate is always kept in alignment, avoiding problems associated with reproducibility of position. The lower and upper squeeze plate as well as the dragi- and cope flask are rotated over approximately 90 to take their vertical position in which the cope flask and drag flask are filled with sand. After the sand-filling, the compacting of the sand also takes place in the vertical position.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the swing frame which carries the squeeze plates and the flasks is received in an opening in the compression frame.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the drag flask is arranged to be movable up and down with respect to the fixed cope flask when the cope flask and drag flask are in their horizontal position.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the second squeeze plate is inserted in the drag flask when the cope flask and drag flask are in their horizontal position.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the second squeeze plate serves as a table to receive and lower the superposed cope and drag when the latter are discharged from the cope flask and drag flask, thus doing away with the need for an additional transport table.<br><br>
2A<br>
The present invention thus provides for a mould making machine for producing flaskless moulds comprising, a drag flask and a cope flask arranged to be rotated between a horizontal position and a vertical position and arranged to be movable relatively towards one another and away from one another in the horizontal position of said drag flask and cope flask, a first squeeze plate inserted in the cope flask and   a second squeeze plate associated with the drag flask, characterised in that the cope flask with the first squeeze plate and the drag flask with the associated second squeeze plate are supported by a swing frame and rotatable in unison between the horizontal position and the vertical position.<br><br><br>
3<br>
According to a further embodiment, the sand-charging openings of the respective cope flask and drag flask will, when the latter are moved into their vertical position, engage the sand-blowing nozzles of the blowhead.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the following detailed part of the present description, the invention will be explained in<br>
more detail with reference to the exemplary embodiments of the machine for producing<br>
flaskless moulds according to the invention shown in the drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 shows a view of the moulding machine from the side in a state just before a<br>
mould-forming operation,<br>
Figure 2 shows the machine in the same state from the front,<br>
Figure 3 shows the state in which the pattern plate has been inserted into the machine,<br>
Figure 4 shows the machine in a state in which the mould flasks are brought together<br>
with the pattern plate in between them,<br>
Figure 4.1 shows the machine in the same state as in Figure 4 from the side,<br>
Figure 5 shows the machine in a side view, with the flasks and squeeze plate<br>
arrangement rotated into the vertical position and the flasks being filled with sand,<br>
Figure 6 shows the next state in which the sand is being compacted,<br>
Figure 7 shows the flasks containing compacted sand returned in the horizontal<br>
position,<br>
Figure 8 shows a view from the side as in Figure 2, but with the drag flask lowered in<br>
order to allow the pattern plate to be taken out of the moulding machine,<br>
Figure 9 shows the next state in which the flasks with the cope and drag are brought<br>
together again without the pattern plate between them in order to allow for the now<br>
superposed cope and drag to be ejected from the flasks, and<br>
A moulding machine for producing fLaskless moulds is provided with at least A cope flask (3) and a drag flask (4) and a pattern plate (15) therebetween. The pair of flasks (3, 4) is alternatively positioned in a horizontal position in which the produced moulds are removed and the pattern plate is inserted and removed, and in a vertical mould-forming position in which the sand is charged and compacted. According to the invention, the cope flask (3), the drag flask (4), the first squeeze plate (5), the second squeeze plate (6) are rotated in unison. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
7<br>
Thereafter, the charged sand is compacted by the first pressure plate 5 and second pressure plate 6 being forced further into the cope flask 3 and drag flask 4, respectively. Hereto the fifth actuator 22 which is fastened to the right-side compression frame 18 and the piston rod 21 is actuated so that the piston rod 21 forces the second squeeze plate 6 into the drag fiask 4. The force thus exercised on the drag fiask is transmitted through the compression frame to the first squeeze plate via the abutment plates 32 and the bracket 33. Since the compression frame 18 is horizontally suspended so that it can move longitudinally, the force exercised on the pressure plates is equalised (Figure 6). As a result, a cope 26 and a drag 27 are moulded by compression in the cope flask 3 and the drag flask 4.<br>
After a predetermined time interval, in which the squeezing is completed, as a next step, the swing frame 2 is rotated over 90° back from the vertical position to its starting position, in which the cope flask 3 and drag fiask 4 take their horizontal position (Figure 7).<br>
In a further step, the drag flask 4 and the lower squeeze plate 6 are lowered in unison and the pattern plate 15 is lowered to take its position in between the cope flask 3 and the drag flask 4 (Figure 8), causing the pattern plate 15 to separate from the cope flask 3 by being lowered whiie resting on the drag flask until the rollers 35 of the suspending member 34 engage the rails 16. Next, the pattern plate 15 is retracted from the space between the cope flask 3 and the drag flask 4 by the hydraulic cylinder 17 to take its position as shown in Figure 2. The drag fiask 4 and the second squeeze plate 6 are raised in unison until the upper surface of the drag flask 4 is in contact with the lower surface of the cope fiask 3, causing the mould surface of the cope to be brought into contact with the mould surface of the drag. Thus, the cope 26 and the drag 27 are superposed (Figure 9).<br>
Thereafter, the first squeeze plate 5 is lowered by the first actuator 7 to separate the cope 26 and drag 27 from the cope flask 3 and drag flask 4. The second squeeze plate 6 is simultaneously lowered and serves as a table for the superposed cope 26 and drag 27 and transports the cope 26 and drag 27 downwards to a position in which the superposed cope 26 and drag 27 can be expelled from the moulding<br></td>
