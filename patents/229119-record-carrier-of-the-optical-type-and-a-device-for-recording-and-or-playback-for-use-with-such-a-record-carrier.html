				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a record carrier of a disc-like optically inscribable type, having a preformed track in which an auxiliarily signal comprising a sequence of codes is recorded by means of a preformed track modulation. The codes comprise a sequence of address codes (AC) specifying the addresses of the track portions in which said address codes (AC) are recorded and special codes (SC). The special codes (SC) can be distinguished from said address codes (AC) and specify control data for controlling a recording by a recording device. The sequence can be obtained by replacing in a sequence of address codes (AC) with consecutive address values a plurality of said address by special codes (SC). The periodic pattern of address codes and special codes has a predetermined positional relationship with respect to a predetermined reference address. Such as for example a positional shift (n) with respect to the start of a Lead-in area (SLI). The presence and or amount of such a shift may be used to represent additional control information or indicate the presence of area on a disc provided with such additional control information.</td>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
*rhc invention relates to a record carrier according to the pre-amble of claim 1. The invention further relates to a device according to.the preamble of claim 6.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Such a record carrier and device are known from the European Patent EP 0 397 238. The special codes therein comprise special information containing for instance control information for recording, such as write power, location of special areas on the record carrier, a reference recording speed, disc application codes, disc type and so en. This has been<br><br><br>
which can.be read in advance. This provides a unique reference for each disc witch can be used to define a positional relationship,<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of a record carrier comprising special codes separated by a first number of successive address codes, is obtained by the characterizing part of claim 3. Such a shift is relatively easy to establish by comparing address codes.<br><br><br>
Fig. 5 gives a number of bit combinations used in the auxiliary codes and address codes;<br>
Fig. 6 shows a possible sequence of successive address codes and special codes in the Lead-in area of a record carrier;<br>
Fig. 7 shows a sequence according to a first embodiment of the invention comprising a shift with respect to the start of the Lead-in area;<br><br><br>
is given in tlie boolc "Principles of optical disc systems", Adam Hilgar Ltd., Bristol and Boston, pp. 210-227,<br>
The track 4 enables a radiation beam wiiicli is aimed at the record carrier 1 for the purpose of recording tiie information to be positioned accurately on the track 4, in other words it enables the position of the radiation beam'in a radial direction to be controlled via a tracking system<br><br><br>
same logic value is two at the most. The synchronising signals 11 are selected in such a way that they can be distinguished from the code signals 12. This is achieved when the maximum number of successive bits of the same logic value in the synchronising signals 11 is selected to be three.<br><br><br>
1). a program area situated between the radial positions bounded by the radii r2 andrS. In<br>
this area the data signals are recorded; 2)  2) a.Lead-in area situated between the radial positions bounded by the radii rl and r2.<br>
This area comprises a Lead-in track in which the addresses of the different data signals in<br>
the program area are stored in the form of a table of contents, as is described, for.<br>
example, in Nederlands Patent Application NL-A-8900766 (PHN 12.887).<br><br><br>
In Fig. 5 the reference numeral 66 denotes the possible bit combination of the address codes in the Lead-in area. On account of the high value mm of the byte 13 in the Lead-in area the niost significant bit 20 of the byte 13 in this area v;'in always have the logicvalue 1. The value ss of the byte 14 varies between 0 and 59, which in the case of the BCD encoding means that the most significant bit 21 of the byte 14 always has the logic value 0. The value ff of the byte 15 varies between 0 and 74, so that, the most significant bit 22 for the byte 15<br><br><br>
wouldeffecl compatibility with legacy player/recorders. To deal with this problem, it is possible to use another area of the disc, for instance the Lead-out area. However, it is not advantageous having drives in player/recorders to jump to this area if there is no information there, in case of a legacy disc, because of the time this takes. Therefore, the embodiments according to' the invention, solve this problem by indicating in the special codes, without effecting compatibility, either such information or the presence of such information in another area of the disc.<br><br><br>
and old discs can be written on new drives, according to the invention, without delay due to<br>
the fact that n=0.<br>
It is noted that instead of defining a shift with respect to the start SLI of the Lead-in area, this<br>
may alternatively be done with respect to the end of the Lead-in area or even with respect to<br>
the start of theLead-oiit area. The shift may thus also being defined backwards.,<br>
An second embodiment according to the invention is shown in Fig. 8, where a pattern P<br>
comprises an ordered sequence of respectively three distinct special codes SCI, SC3, and<br><br><br>
frequency of a reference clock signal Ck. The motor control circuit 87 may comprise, for example, a phase detector for detecting the phase difference between the detection signal Vd and the reference clock signal Ck, and a power supply circuit for powering the motor with a voltage whose value depends on the phase difference ftus detected.<br><br><br>
which is loaded with suitable control program to be described hereinafter. The signals VI and V2.on the output of the decoder circuit 93 are applied to a two-input OR gate 95. The signals VI and V2 indicate that the bytes 13,14 and 15 on the output of the converter 92 represent an address code within the Lead-in area or an address code outside the Lead-in area, so that the output signal of the OR gate 95 always indicates whether the output signal of the converter 92 concerns address information. The output signal of the OR gate 95 is applied to an input<br><br><br>
rack being scanned is available, even in the case that instead of an address code AC an ipecial code SC is recorded in the track; This also means that the track portions in which the iddress codes are recorded remain addressable, The bytes 13, 14 and 15 on the output of the jonverter 92 are applied not only to the parallel inputs of Che counting circuit 97 but also to he control circuit 94.<br><br><br>
Step S1 is performed immediately after the record carrier 1 has been loaded into the recording device. In this step S1 the read/write head 82 is set to the read mode and by means of the signals V3 and V4 on the output of the decoder circuit 96 it is ascertained whether the code word supplied to the output of the converter 92 comprises a special code containing the address values of the Lead-in or the Lead-out area. When the presence of theses special codes is detected the values of the Lead-in area and of the Lead-out area are stored in a memory of the control circuit. 94<br><br><br>
contents is recorded in the lead-in area in step S9 and the lead out signal is recorded in step SIO, after which the program is tenninated.<br>
In the foregoing the invention has been illustrated for an optical recording system for recording a standard CD signal on a record carrier comprising substantially concentric tracks. However, it is to be noted that the invention equally applies to the recording of signals in linear tracks. Moreover, the invention may also be applied to the recording of other data signals than CD signals. Neither is the scope of the inyendon limited to optical recording<br><br>
