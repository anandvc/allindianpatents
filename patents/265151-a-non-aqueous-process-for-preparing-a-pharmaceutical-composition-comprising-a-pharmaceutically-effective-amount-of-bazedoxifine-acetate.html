				<td>BAZEDOXIFENE ACETATE FORMULATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to formulations and compositions thereof of the<br>
selective estrogen receptor moduiator 1-[4-(2-azepan-1-yl-ethoxy)-benzylj-2-(4-hydroxy-<br>
phenyl)-3-methyt-1H-indol-5-ol acetic acid (bazedoxifene acetate).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bazedoxifene acetate (1-[4-(2-azepan-1-yl-ethoxy)-benzyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-<br>
methyl-1 H-indol-5-ol acetic acid), having the chemical formula shown below:<br><br>
belongs to the class of drugs typically referred to as selective estrogen receptor modulators<br>
(SERMs). Consistent with its classification, bazedoxifene demonstrates affinity for estrogen<br>
receptors (ER) but shows tissue selective estrogenic effects. For example, bazedoxifene<br>
acetate demonstrates little or no stimulation of uterine response in preclinical models of<br>
uterine stimulation. Conversely, bazedoxifene acetate demonstrates an estrogen agonist-<br>
like effect in preventing bone loss and reducing cholesterol in an ovariectomized rat model of<br>
osteopenia. In an MCF-7 cell line (human breast cancer cell line), bazedoxifene acetate<br>
behaves as an estrogen antagonist. These data demonstrate that bazedoxifene acetate is<br>
estrogenic on bone and cardiovascular lipid parameters and antiestrogenic on uterine and<br>
.mammary fesue and thus has the potential for treating a number of different diseases or<br>
disease-like states wherein the estrogen receptor is involved.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,998,402 and 6,479,535 report the preparation of bazedoxifene<br>
acetate and characterize the salt as having a melting point of 174-178 °C. The synthetic<br>
preparation of bazedoxifene acetate has also appeared in the general literature. See,, for<br>
1<br><br>
example, Miller et al, J. Med. CJicm., 2001, 44, 1654-1657, which reports the salt as a<br>
crystalline solid having a melting point of 170.5-172.5 °C. Further description of the drug's<br>
biological activity has appeared in the genera! literature as well (e.g. Miller, et al. Drugs of<br>
the Future, 2002, 27(2), 117-121).<br>
It is well known that the crystalline polymorph form of a particular drug is often an<br>
important determinant of the drug's ease of preparation, stability, solubility, storage stability,<br>
ease of formulation and in vivo pharmacology. Polymorphic forms occur where the same<br>
composition of matter crystallizes in a different iattice arrangement resulting in different<br>
thermodynamic properties and stabilities specific to the particular polymorph form. In cases<br>
where two or more polymorph substances can be produced, it is desirable to have a method<br>
to make both polymorphs in pure form. In deciding which polymorph is preferable, the<br>
numerous properties of the polymorphs must be compared and the preferred polymorph<br>
chosen based on the many physical property variables. It is entirely possible that one<br>
polymorph form can be preferable in some circumstances where certain aspects such as<br>
ease of preparation, stability, etc are deemed to be critical. In other situations, a different<br>
polymorph maybe preferred for greater solubility and/or superior pharmacokinetics.<br>
Because of the potential advantages associated with one pure polymorphic form, it is<br>
desirable to prevent or minimize polymorphic conversion (i.e., conversion of one form to<br>
another) when two or more polymorphic forms of one substance can exist. Such polymorph<br>
conversion can occur during both the preparation of formulations containing the polymorph,<br>
and during storage of a pharmaceutical dosage form containing the polymorph.<br>
Two different crystalline polymorphs of anhydrous bazedoxifene acetate, form A and form B,<br>
have been disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/100,983 and 11,100,998, both filed<br>
April 6, 2005 and each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Form A is<br>
distinguished from Form B by numerous physical properties which are tabulated below. As<br>
can be seen from the data in the Table, Form B appears to be thermodynamically more<br>
stable than form A, contributing to numerous advantages. For example, the increased<br>
stability of form B would facilitate manufacturing and purification processes. Form B would<br>
also be expected to have better resistance to degradation brought on by, for example,<br>
exposure to high temperatures and/or humidity, and have a longer shelf-life than Form A or<br>
amorphous material. In contrast, Form A appears to have higher solubility in aqueous and<br>
organic solvent systems than does form B, which is advantageous in particular formulations<br>
or doses where the solubility of the particular composition is of concern. For example,<br>
higher solubility can contribute to better biological absorption and distribution of the drug, as<br>
well as facilitate formulation in liquid carriers.<br>
2<br><br><br>
Given the potential advantages of a single polymorphic form, it can be seen "that<br>
formulations having reduced polymorphic conversion can provides significant benefits. The<br>
bazedoxifene acetate formulations and compositions described herein helps meet these and<br>
other needs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides, inter alia, bazedoxifene acetate formulations and<br>
compositions thereof having improved properties relating to reduction, elimination or<br>
prevention of polymorphic conversion of bazedoxifene acetate. In some embodiments, the<br>
compositions are prepared by a non-aqueous process, for example dry granulation, roller<br>
compaction or direct blend processes. In some embodiments, the present invention<br>
provides a direct blend formulation of bazedoxifene acetate that can reduce the potential for<br>
polymorphic conversion of bazedoxifene acetate, such as from form A to form B, compared<br>
to other more complex formulations.<br>
The use of a direct blend formulation is simple and cost-efficient compared to other<br>
more time consuming processes such as wet granulation or roller-compaction, although<br>
roller compaction processes can be utilized in some embodiments of the invention. Many of<br>
the complex formulations such as roller compaction require large power inputs during<br>
mixing, milling and compaction. In addition, a process with power input for an extended<br>
period of time can also increase potential polymorphic conversions. Thus, another<br>
advantage associated with a direct blend formulation is to use lower power in the process.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed the use of water<br>
in a wet granulation has the potential of increasing polymorphic conversion during<br>
processing and storage because of the potential for solubilization of the bazedoxifene<br>
acetate. Upon drying, recrystallization of the bazedoxifene acetate can result in polymorphic<br>
conversion, such as from form A to form B. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention<br>
provides non-aqueous processes (i.e. processes that do not utilize water) for producing the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions described- herein. Examples of such non-aqueous processes<br>
include dry granulation and roller compaction processes, as are known in the art. In one<br>
particular embodiment, the non-aqueous process is a direct blend process, which is used to<br>
prepare direct blend formulations of bazedoxifene acetate, and which does not require<br>
contacting the bazedoxifene acetate with water. Such non-aqueous processes can be<br>
advantageous where it is desired to minimize conversion from one polymorphic form of<br>
bazedoxifene acetate to another, for example to minimize the conversion' of the form A<br>
polymorph to the form B polymorph.<br>
A further advantage of the present compositions is that there is no need to employ a<br>
surfactant, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. While not wishing to be bound by any particular<br>
theory, it is believed the use of a surfactant can increase wetting, solubility and dissolution,<br>
and the increased solubility can facilitate potential polymorphic conversion between the<br>
different polymorphic forms.<br>

In some embodiments, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions -<br>
comprising a pharmaceutical!;/ effective amount of bazedoxifene acetate, and a carrier or<br>
excipient system, the carrier or excipient system comprising:<br>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of<br>
bazedoxifene acetate and a carrier or excipient system, the carrier or excipient system<br>
comprising:<br>
a)	a first filler/diluent component comprising from about 5% to about 85% by<br>
Vi/eight of the pharmaceutical formulation;<br>
b)	an optional second filler/diluent component comprising from about 5% to<br>
about 85% by weight of the pharmaceutical formulation;<br>
c)	an optional antioxidant component comprising up to about 15% by weight of<br>
the pharmaceutical formulation;<br>
d)	a glidant/disintegrant component comprising from about 0.01% to about 10%<br>

e)	a lubricant component comprising from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight<br>
of the pharmaceutical formulation. In some embodiments, the compositions are prepared by<br>
a non-aqueous process, for example a dry granulation, roller compaction or direct blend<br>
process.<br>
In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain bazedoxifene<br>
acetate substantially in one pure crystalline polymorph, preferably substantially in the A<br>
polymorph form. In further embodiments, at least about 90% of the bazedoxifene acetate is<br>
present in the A polymorph form. In some further embodiments, at least about 80% of said<br>
bazedoxifene acetate is present in the A polymorph form. The direct blend formulations of<br>
the present invention have improved properties relating to reduction, elimination or<br>
prevention of polymorphic conversion of bazedoxifene acetate, such as from form A to form<br>
B, during preparation of the compositions, and during storage thereafter. Therefore, the<br>
formulations of the present invention more effectively maintain advantages associated with a<br>
single polymorph form.<br>

Procedure for Preparation of Form A<br>
13<br><br>
A 2 gal hydrogenation vessel with agitator was charged with hexameihyleneimino<br>
benzyloxyindole (250 g, 0.3841 mol; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,402 for a preparation), ethanol<br>
(denatured with 5% by volume ethyl acetate) (1578 g, 2000 ml_), and palladium on carbon<br>
10% (25 g). The reactants were hydrogenated at 25 °C and 50 psi for 20 hours. Reaction<br>
progress was monitored by HPLC (Column: CSC-S ODS 2, 25 cm; Mobile phase: 20 % 0.02<br>
M NH4H2P04 (2 mL TEA/L, pH = 3) and 80 % MeCN; Flow: 2 mL/min; Detector: 220 nm).<br>
The reaction was considered complete when less than 1% of either the hexamethyleneimino<br>
benzyloxyindole (18.2 min retention time) or mono-debenzyiated derivative thereof (5.1 min<br>
retention time) was detected.<br>
The mixture was filtered through a cartridge which was subsequently rinsed with<br>
ethanol (denatured with 5% by volume ethyl acetate) (2 x 198 g, 2 x 250 mL). The filtrate<br>
was transferred to a 5 L multi-neck flask with agitator charged with L-ascorbic acid (2.04 g,<br>
0.0116 mols) under nitrogen. Acetic acid ( 34.6 g, 0.5762 moles) was added at 20 °C while<br>
stirring. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours (pH was about 5 and<br>
crystallization began within about 10 minutes of addition of acetic acid). The reaction<br>
mixture was then cooled to 0 °C and maintained at this temperature for 2 hours. The<br>
resulting solid was collected by filtration on a Buch.ner funnel and washed with ethanol<br>
(denatured with 5% by volume ethyl acetate) (2 x 150 g, 2 x 190 mL) at 0 °C.<br>
The solid product was further purified by charging a 3 L multineck flask (with agitator,<br>
thermometer, and condenser under nitrogen) with the filtered solid, ethanol (denatured with<br>
5% by volume ethyl acetate) (1105 g, 1400 mL), and L-ascorbic acid (1.73 g, 0.01 mols).<br>
The resulting mixture was heated to 75 °C and cooled to 20 °C over the course of 2 hours.<br>
The resulting suspension was further cooled to 0 °C and held at this temperature for 2 hours.<br>
The resulting solid product was collected by filtration with a Buchner funnel and washed with<br>
ethanol (denatured with 5% by volume ethyl acetate) (2 x 79 g, 2 x 100 mL) at 0 °C. The<br>
product was dried in vacuo at 60 °C, 5 mm Hg for 24 hours giving 151.3 g bazedoxifene<br>
acetate Form A (74.2 % yield).<br>

XRPD analyses were carried out on a (Scintag X2) X-ray powder diffractometer using<br>
Cu K a radiation. The instrument was equipped with tube power, and amperage was set at<br>
45 kV and 40 mA. The divergence and scattering slits were set at 1° and the receiving $':t<br>
14<br><br>
was set at 0.2 mm. A thela-lwo theta continuous scan at 37inin (0.4 sec/0.02° step) from 3<br>
to 40 D29 was used.<br>
XRPD data are provided in the Table below. The corresponding XRPD pattern is<br>
provided in Figure 1.<br><br>
Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy<br>
IR spectra (e.g., see Figure 2) were acquired as follows. Samples were prepared as<br>
potassium bromide (KBr) discs (or pellets). A small amount of each sample (about 3 mg)<br>
was ground in a hard surface mortar until .glossy in appearance. One half gram (0.5 g) of KBr<br>
was added to the sample and the mixture was continuously ground until well mixed. The<br>
mixture was then transferred to a die and pressed into a disc using a hydraulic press.<br>
The IR spectrum of Figure 2 was obtained using a DIGILAB EXCALIBU'R Series<br>

Procedure for Preparation of Form B<br>
Preparation of Eazedoxiiene Acetate Form B from Form A<br>
To a stirred solution of 594 g of ethanol (denatured with 5% of acetone and with 3%<br>
of cyclohexane) and 184 g of ethyl acetate, 400 g of pure bazedoxifene acetate Form A were<br>
added under nitrogen (e.g., see Example 2). The heterogeneous mixture was kept at 30 °C<br>
and stirred overnight under nitrogen.<br>
The completion of the crystalline transformation was determined by DSC analysis.<br>
The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and stirred for 2 hrs under nitrogen. The product was<br>
filtered, washed with a mixture of denatured ethanol-and ethyl acetate as above and dried<br>
overnight at 60 °C under vacuum giving 391 g (97.7% yield) of bazedoxifene acetate Form B<br>
polymorph.<br>
A substantially identical result was obtained using absolute ethanol or ethanol<br>
denatured with 5% toluene.<br>
Preparation of Bazedoxifene Acetate Form B from a Mixture of Form A and Form B<br>
Bazedoxifene acetate Form A (298 g) and bazedoxifene acetate Form B (2 g) were<br>
suspended in a degassed mixture of ethyl acetate (400 ml_) and ethyl alcohol (2400 ml_).<br>
The resulting mixture was heated at reflux temperature for 2 hours. The suspension was<br>
cooled to 50 °C over the course of 1 hour and then to 20°C over the course of 3 hours. The<br>
mixture was maintained at 20 °C for 13 hours and the product was recovered by filtration<br>
and washing with ethyl alcohol (78.9 g divided in 2 portions). The wet material was dried<br>
under vacuum at 60°C resulting in 276.8 g of bazedoxifene acetate Form B.<br>

Each of six female dogs (7.2-11.0 kg), received a single 10 mg dose of bazedoxifene<br>
acetate from both formulations following an overnight fast in a non-randomized crossover<br>
design. 20 mg wet granulation tablets as described above were broken in half for the 10 mg<br>
dose from that formulation. Blood samples were drawn at 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 8,<br>
12 and Z4"hours after dosing, plasma was separated and assayed for bazedoxifene acetate<br>
content.<br>
Individual dog plasma bazedoxifene concentration-time profiles were subjected to<br>
noncomparfmental pharmacokinetic analyses (WinNonlin, Model 200). The following<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each dog and descriptive statistics were<br>
calculated for comparison between the two formulations: AUCo-t, Cmax, tmax. The results are<br>
summarized in the following Table:<br>

Because of the variability in the plasma bazedoxifene levels typically observed in this<br>
protocol, terminal elimination half-lives could not be determined for the majority of the<br>
piasma bazedoxifene concentration-time profiles; therefore AUC0-t values were compared<br>
between the two tablet formulations. Also, the exposure levels of bazedoxifene from the<br>
direct blend tablet appeared to be slightly lower than those from the wet granulation tablet.<br>
Figure 7 shows the mean (SD) plasma bazedoxifene levels in female dogs following<br>
single oral dose administration of 10 mg bazedoxifene as direct blend tablet of Example 1,<br>
and the wet granulated tablet described above. Figure 8 shows individual dog plasma<br>
bazedoxifene ievels following single oral dose administration of the 10 mg bazedoxifene<br>
19<br><br>
direct blend tablets, and Figure 9 shows individual dog plasma bazedoxifene level's following<br>
single oral dose administration of 10 mg bazedoxifene via the wet granulated tablet<br>
described above.<br>
As can be seen from these data, the direct blend formulation prepared in accordance<br>
with the present invention provides administration of bazedoxifene that is comparable to that<br>
provided by the tablets prepared by the wet granulation process.<br>
