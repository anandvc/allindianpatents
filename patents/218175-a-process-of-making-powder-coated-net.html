				<td>The invention deals with "a process of making powder coated net".<br>
Prior Art:-   Nets are being made from wires or sheets. Various patents Viz.     DE   10128445,   AU  5569299,    US 6170533,   GB  1105021,  GB  1134960, DE19925939,  DE  19925938,  US    5133463,  US    4657685, R« 2692615 describe various processes for making powder coated net products.<br>
Disadvantages of Prior Art:- Nets made from present day technologies suffer from many problems. Nets usually retain wetness, moisture which is common result due to change in season. Near coastal area air is more salty, moreover in rainy season air is more humid. Because of all these reasons rusting is common phenomenon in life of net. Hence net life decreases automatically. Moreover if this rusted net is painted, the colouring is never perfect, because at certain places rest is never perfectly cleaned, hence netiosses its colour &amp; hence life again decreases.<br>
Advantages of Prior Art:-	One of the object of this invention is to    avoid<br>
rusting to nets. Another object of the invention is to permanent colour nets, with less chances for nets to loose colour.<br>
Another object the invention in to make nets more attractive, less prove to attach by water, make washable. Moreover another object of the invention is to make the whole process viz. 'avoid rusting &amp; colouring of various nets cheaper as in this process all waste will be of raw material &amp; not of final products as in prior art.<br>
Hence a process is proposed for the same.<br><br>
Statement of the Invention:-<br>
"A process of making powder coated net" comprising:-drawing a black wire of predetermined size from wire rod; heating said black wire in a heated room at particular temperature; knitting said black wire obtained after heating on Power looms; said knitted product obtained from power loom is passed through<br>
(a)	Tank 1 containing Nitrogen Oxidemaintained at 70°-80°c to remove oil &amp; dust from said knitted product;<br>
(b)	Tank 2 containing water at room temperature;<br>
(c)	Tank   3   containing   sodium   carbonate,   tri   sodium   phosphate,   sodium diphosphate;<br>
(d)	Tank 4 containing water at 80°C;<br>
(e)	Tank 5 containing various phosphating chemicals viz. phosphoric acid, nitric acid, zinc oxide etc;<br>
(f)	Tank 6 containing water;<br>
(g)	Tank 7 containing Chromic acid, phosphoric acid etc ;<br>
The product obtained after passing through tank 1 to 7 is powder coated within a range of 40 to 60 micron from epoxy powder to get powder coated<br>
net;<br>
said powdered coated net is heated in a chamber maintained at 200°-250°C and said heated net is cooled at room temp.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention:-	The   nature   of   the   invention,   its<br>
objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown by flow diagram in prior art, mild steel wire rod is taken then drawn to black wire of predetermined diameter, Now this rod is heated in room at 50° c, then this heated wire is polished or galvanized. Basically this polished or galvanized wire acts as raw material, the wire is then knitted on power looms &amp; nets of various<br><br>
shapes &amp; dimensions can obtained, which can be described as finish product. Now these finished Nets can be installed at various sites can be painted as desired by the<br>
user.<br>
But the process as proposed by invention (Fig. 2) makes painting an essential feature of various process as described. As supplemented by flow diagram like in prior art at first black wire of suitable diameter is drawn from a wire now this drawn wire is heated in room maintained at 50° c. Now as evident by flow diagram this is not polished, but nets of various shapes, dimensions are knitted on power looms, hence all the wastage will be on this knitted nets. Now this knitted products is past through to 7 tanks for undergoing various processes as describes.<br><br>
(1)      Tankl:-<br><br>
Tank 1 contains a solution of nitrogen oxide, which is maintained at a temperature of 70° - 80° c &amp; this tank removes dust &amp; oils from knitted product.<br><br>
(2)      Tank 2:-        Tank   2   contains   water,   which    is    maintained   at   room<br>
temperature.<br><br>
(3)      Tank 3:<br><br>
The product obtained from tank 2 is passed though tank 3, for degriging while the tank contains, sodium carbonate, tri sodium phosphate, sodium diphosphate.<br><br>
(4)	Tank 4.:-       The knitted product after degriging obtained by tank 3 is passed<br>
into tank 4 which contains water maintained at 80°c, to further clean the knitted product.<br>
(5)	Tank 5.:-       The cleaned product from tank 4 is passed for phosphating in<br>
tank 5 which contains chemicals like phosphoric acid, nitric acid, Zinc oxide etc.<br>
(6)      Tank 6:-        Tank 6 contains water &amp; cleans product obtained from tank 5.<br><br>
(7)      Tank 7:-        The product obtained from tank 6 is passed through tank 7 for<br>
passivation, which contains chromic acid, phosphoric acid.<br>
Now this product is powder coated from automatic compressor machine up to a thickness of 40-60 Micron any desired colour can be painted on this net.<br>
This powder coated product is heated in a chamber maintained at 200°-250° c &amp; said heated product is cooled at room temp.<br>
The product obtained from above process will be more attractive, rust proof, water proof, being washable, Moreover its colour will not be dampened.<br>
It will be evident to those skilled in the art the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrated embodiments and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
