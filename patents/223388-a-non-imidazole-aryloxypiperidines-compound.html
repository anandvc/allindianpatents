Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to aryloxypiperidines, their synthesis and their<br>
use, for example, for the treatment of disorders and conditions mediated by the<br>
histamine receptor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Histamine [2-(imidazol-4-yI)ethylamine] is a transmitter substance. Histamine<br>
exerts a physiological effect via multiple distinct G-protein coupled receptors. It plays<br>
a role in immediate hypersensitivity reactions and is released from mast cells<br>
following antigen IgE antibody interaction. The actions of released histamine on the<br>
vasculature and smooth muscle system account for the symptoms of the allergic<br>
response. These actions occur at the H, receptor (Ash, A.S.F. and Schiid, H.O., Br.<br>
J. Pharmacol., 1966, 27,427) and are blocked by the classical antihistamines (e.g.<br>
diphenhydramine). Histamine is also an important regulator of gastric acid secretion<br>
through its action on parietal cells. These effects of hisiamine are mediated via the<br>
H2 receptor (Black, J.W., Duncan, W.A.M,. Durant, C.J., Ganeltin, C.R. and Parsons,<br>
E. M., Nature, 1972, 236, 385).and are blocked by H2 receptor antagonists (e.g.<br>
cimetidine). The third histamine receptor —H3— was first described as a<br>
presynaptic autoreceptor in the central nervous system (CMS) (Arrang, J.-M.,<br>
Garbarg, M., and Schwartz, J.-C, Nature 1983, 302, 832) controlling the synthesis<br>
and release of histamine. Recent evidence has emerged showing that the H3<br>
receptors are also located presynaptically as heteroreceptors on serotonerglc,<br>
noradrsnergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric<br>
acid containing) neurons. These H3 receptors have aiso recently been identified in<br>
peripheral tissues such as vascular smooth muscle Consequently there are many<br>
potential therapeutic applications for histamine H3 agonists, antagonists, and inverse<br>
agonists. (See: "The Histamine H3 Reuepior-A Target for New Drugs', Leurs, R., and<br>
Timmerman, H., (Editors), Elsevier, 1998; Morisset et al., Nature, 2000, 408, 860-<br>
864.) A fourth histamine receptor —H4— was recently described by Oda et al., (J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 2000, 275, 36781-36786).<br>
The potential use of histamine H3 agonists in sleep/wake and<br>
arousal/vigilance disorders is suggested based on animal studies (Lin et al, Br. Res.,<br>
1990, 523, 325; Monti et al Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1991, 205, 283). Their use in the<br>
treatment of migraine has also been suggested (McLeod et al Abstr. Society<br>
Neuroscience, 1996, 22, 2010) based on their ability to inhibit neurogenic<br>
inflammation. Other applications could be a protective role in myocardial ischemia<br>
and hypertension where blockade of norepinephrine release is beneficial (Imamura<br>
et al J. Pharmacol. Expt. Ther., 1994, 271, 1259). It has been suggested that<br>
histamine H3 agonists may be beneficial in asthma due to their ability to reduce non-<br>
adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmission in airways and to reduce<br>
microvascular leakage (Ichinose et al Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1989, 174, 49).<br>
Several indications for histamine H3 antagonists and inverse agonists have<br>
similarly been proposed based on animal pharmacology experiments with known<br>
histamine H3 antagonists (e.g. thioperamide). These include dementia, Alzheimer's<br>
disease (Panula et al Abstr. Society Neuroscience, 1995, 21, 1977), epilepsy<br>
(Yokoyama et al Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1993, 234, 129) narcolepsy, eating disorders<br>
(Machidori et al Brain Research 1992, 590,180), motion sickness, vertigo, attention<br>
deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), learning and memory (Barnes et al Abstr.<br>
Society Neuroscience, 1993, 19, 1813), schizophrenia (Schlicker et al Naunyn-<br>
Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 1996, 353, 290-294); (also see; Stark et ai<br>
Drugs Future, 1996, 21, 507 and Leurs et al Progress in Drug Research, 1995, 45,<br>
107 and references cited therein). Histamine H3 antagonists, alone or in<br>
combination with a histamine H1 antagonist, are reported to be useful for the<br>
treatment of upper airway allergic response (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,217,986; 5,352,707<br>
and 5,869,479). Recently, a histamine H3 antagonist (GT-2331) was identified and<br>
is being developed by Gliatech Inc. (Gliatech Inc. Press Release Nov. 5, 1998;<br>
Bioworld Today, March 2, 1999) for the treatment of CNS disorders.<br>
As noted, the prior art related to histamine H3 ligands has been<br>
comprehensively reviewed ('The Histamine H3 Receptor-A Target for New Drugs",<br>
Leurs, R., and Timmerman, H., (Editors), Elsevier, 1998). Within this reference the<br>
medicinal chemistry of histamine H3 agonists and antagonists was reviewed (see<br>
Krause et al and Phillips et al respectively). The importance of an imidazole moiety<br>
containing only a single substitution in the 4 position was noted together with the<br>
deleterious effects of additional substitution on activity. Particularly methvlation of<br>
the imidazole ring at any of the remaining unsubstituted positions was reported to<br>
strongly decrease activity. Additional publications support the hypothesis that an<br>
imidazole function is essential for high affinity histamine H3 receptor figands (See, Ali<br>
et al J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 903 and Stark et al. Drugs Future, 1996, 21, 507 and<br>
references cited therein). However many imidazole containing compounds are<br>
. substrates for histamine methyl transferase, the major histamine metabolizing<br>
enzyme in humans, which leads to shortened half lives and lower bioavailability<br>
(See, Rouleau et al J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997, 281, 1085). In addition,<br>
imidazole containing drugs, via their interaction with the cytochrome P450<br>
monooxygenase system, can result in unfavorable biotransformations due to<br>
enzyme induction or enzyme inhibition. (Kapetanovic et al Drug Metab. Dispos.<br>
1984, 12, 560; Sheets et al Drug Metab. Dispos. 1984, 12, 603; Back, et al Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol. 1985, 85, 121; Lavrijsen et al Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986, 35, 1867;<br>
Drug Saf., 1998, 18, 83). The poor blood brain barrier penetration of earlier<br>
histamine H3 receptor ligands may also be associated with the imidazole fragment<br>
(Ganellin et al Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim.Ger.) 1998, 331, 395).<br>
More recently, several publications have described histamine H3 ligands that<br>
do not contain an imidazole moiety. For example; Ganellin et al Arch. Pharm.<br>
(Weinheim.Ger.) 1998, 331, 395; Walczynski et al Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim,Ger.)<br>
1999, 332, 389; Walczynski et al Farmaco 1999, 684; Linney et al J. Med. Chem.<br>
2000, 2362; Tozer and Kalindjian Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000, 10, 1045-1055;<br>
U.S. Patent 5,352, 707; PCT Application WO99/42458, Aug 26, 1999; and European<br>
Patent Application 0978512, Feb 9, 2000.<br>
The compounds of the present invention do not contain the imidazole moiety,<br>
and its inherent liabilities, and maintain potency at the human H3 receptor. Thus in<br>
the present invention receptor binding was determined using the human histamine<br>
H3 receptor (See Lovenberg et al Mol. Pharmacol. 1999, 1107). Screening using the<br>
human receptor is particularly important for the identification of new therapies for the<br>
treatment of human diseas. Conventional binding assays for example are<br>
determined using rat synaptosomes (Garbarg et al J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992,<br>
263, 304), rat cortical membranes (West et al Mol. Pharmacol. 1990,, 610), and<br>
guinea pig brain (Korte et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990, 978). Only<br>
limited studies have been performed previously using human tissue but these allude<br>
to significant differences in the pharmacology of rodent and primate receptors (West<br>
et al Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 233).<br>
We now describe a series of aryloxypiperidines with the ability to modulate<br>
the activity of the histamine receptor, specifically the H3 receptor, without the<br>
(inherent problems associated with the presence of an imidazolyl moiety.<br>

As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term "heterocyclyl-alkyl" or<br>
"heterocyclyl-alkylene" shall denote any alkyl group substituted with a heterocyclyl<br>
group, wherein the heterocycly-alkyl group is bound through the alkyl portion to the<br>
central part of the molecule. Suitable examples of heterocyclyl-alkyl groups include,<br>
but are not limited to piperidinylmethyl, pyrrolidinylmethyl, piperidinylethyl,<br>
piperazinylmethyl, pyrrolylbutyl, piperidinylisobutyl, pyridylmethyl, pyrimidylethyl, and<br>
the like.<br>
When a particular group is "substituted" (e.g., alkyl, alkylene, cycloalkyl, aryl,<br>
heterocyclyl, heteroaryl), that group may have one or more substituents, preferably<br>
from one to five substituents, more preferably from one to three substituents, most<br>
preferably from one to two substituents, independently selected from the list of<br>
substituents.<br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular<br>
location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that molecule.<br>

portion of the designated side chain is described first, followed by the adjacent<br>
functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for example, a<br>
"phenyl(alkyl)amido(alkyl)" substituent refers to a group of the formula<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal,<br>
most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or<br>
experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that amount<br>
of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal<br>
response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher,<br>
veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes prevention, inhibition of<br>
onset, or alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product<br>

cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, hydrogen gas in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, and the like, in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>

acid to decrease the pH of the reaction mixture to a pH of less than about 7 may be<br>
necessary to effect reaction, wherein the acid is added as needed and is such as<br>
acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like. One skilled in the art will furthermore<br>

A compound of formula (XXXI) is obtained from a compound of formula<br>
(XXIX) by reacting a compound of formula (XXIX) with a reducing agent in a solvent.<br>
Reducing agents include hydrogen gas over a catalyst, for example palladium,<br>
platinum, Raney nickel or the like. In a preferred embodiment the reducing agent is<br>
SnCI2 in ethanol in the presence or absence of water at ambient temperature to the<br>
boiling point of the solvent. A compound of formula (XXXII) is prepared from a<br>
compound of formula (XXXI) by reacting a compound of formula (XXXI) with a<br>
compound of formula (XXXIII) in which X2 is a leaving group. In a preferred<br>
embodiment X2 is CI and OH. Thus when X2 is Cl the compound of formula (XXXI)<br>
is reacted with a compound of formula (XXXIII) in a solvent such as DCM or THF in<br>
the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine. When X2 is OH a<br>
compound of formula (XXXI) is reacted with a compound of formula (XXXIII) via<br>
peptide coupling, for example in the presence of DCC in a solvent such as DCM or<br>
THF. A compound of formula (XXX) is prepared from a compound of formula<br>
(XXXII) using a reducing agent. Reducing agents include; BH3:THF, and BH3:Me2S.<br>
A preferred reducing agent is BH3:Me2S, in THF at elevated temperature, preferably<br>
at the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
A compound of formula (XXXV) may be prepared according to the processes<br>
outlined in Scheme 8.<br>
A compound of formula (XXXIV) is reacted with a compound of formula (X) in<br>
the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, hydrogen gas in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, and the like, in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
trifluoroethanol, and the like, to yield the compound of formula (XXXVI). One skilled<br>
in the art will recognize that addition of acid to decrease the pH of the reaction<br>
mixture to a pH of less than about 7 may be necessary to effect reaction, wherein<br>
the acid is added as needed and is such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the<br>
like. One skilled in the art will furthermore recognize that a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted nonaromatic heterocycle containing secondary amine functionality<br>
may be used in place of the compound of formula (X). A compound of formula<br>
(XXXVI) is reacted with a compound of formula (IV) according to the procedure of<br>
Step B, Scheme 1, to give a compound of formula (XXXV).<br>
Compounds of formula (XXXVIII) may be prepared according to the<br>
processes outlined in Scheme 9.<br>
A compound of formula (XXXVII) where R3 is selected from Br and I,<br>
preferably I, is reacted with a compound of formula (XXXIX) in the presence of a<br>
catalyst such as tris(dibenzylidineacetone)dipalladium(0), and the like, in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium t-butoxide, cesium carbonate, triethylamine,<br>
potassium carbonate, and the like, in an organic solvent such as THF or dioxane,<br>
and the like, preferably in the presence of BINAP (2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-<br>
dinaphthyl) and 18-Crown-6 (a crown ether), to yield the corresponding compound of<br>
formula (XL). A compound of formula (XLI) may be obtained from a compound of<br>
formula (XL) via the removal of the protecting group Y1 followed by reaction with the<br>
compound of formula (IV) according to the procedures of Scheme 1, Step B. A<br>
compound of formula (XLII) is prepared from a compound of formula (XLI) via<br>
removal of the protecting group Y2. One skilled in the art will further recognize and<br>
understand the concept of orthogonal protection such that the groups Y^ and Y2 may<br>
be removed separately and at the appropriate points in the Scheme. A compound of<br>
formula (XXXVIII) is prepared from a compound of formula (XLII) by reacting a<br>
compound of formula (XLII) with a compound of formula (XXc) in the presence of a<br>
reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium<br>
triacetoxyborohydride, hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst, and the like, in a<br>
solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 1,2-dichloroethane, trifluoroethanol, and the like,<br>
to yield the compound of formula (XXXVII). One skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
addition of acid to decrease the pH of the reaction mixture to a pH of less than about<br>
7 may be necessary to effect reaction, wherein the acid is added as needed and is<br>
such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like.<br>
A compound of formula (XLIV) is prepared from a compound of formula<br>
(XLIII) according to the procedure outlined in Scheme 10.<br>
Compounds of formula (XLIII) are reacted with compounds of formula (IV)<br>
according to the procedure of Step B, Scheme 1 to give compounds of formula<br>
(XLV). Removal of the protecting group Y1 affords compound of formula (XLVI). In<br>
a preferred embodiment the group Y1 is a benzyl group, thus the compound of<br>
formula (XLV) is reacted with hydrogen or ammonium formate in the presence of a<br>
catalyst such as palladium on carbon, or the like, in a solvent such as methanol,<br>
ethanol and the like (i.e. catalytic hydrogenolysis) to yield the corresponding<br>
compound of formula (XLVI). The compound of formula (XLVI) is reacted with a<br>
compound of formula (XXXVII) where X3 is selected from the group consisting Cl, Br,<br>
I, tosylate, mesylate, and the like, in the presence of a base such as sodium<br>
hydroxide. TEA, sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, and the like, in an organic<br>
solvent such as DCM, THF, DMF, DMA, and the like, to yield the corresponding<br>
compound of formula (XLIV). In an alternative embodiment the compound of<br>
formula (XXXVII) where X3 is OH is reacted with a compound of formula (XLVI)<br>
according to the procedures of Step B, Scheme 1.<br>

1. Formulation and Administration<br>
The compounds or compositions of the invention may be formulated and<br>
administered to a subject by any conventional route of administration, including, but<br>
not limited to, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and<br>
parenteral administration. The quantity of the compound which is effective for<br>
treating each condition may vary, and can be determined by one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art.<br>
For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention refer to non-<br>
toxic "pharmaceutically acceptable salts." Other salts may, however, be useful in the<br>
preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds<br>
include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of<br>
the compound with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid,<br>
benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.<br>
Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali ml salts, e.g., sodium or<br>
potassium salts; alkaline earth ml salts, e.g., calcium or magnesium salts; and salts<br>
formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g., quaternary ammonium salts.<br>
Thus, representative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the following:<br>
acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate,<br>
bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate,<br>
dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate,<br>
gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine,<br>
hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isothionate, lactate,<br>
lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylbromide,<br>
methylnitrate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine<br>

phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, sulfate, subacetate,<br>
succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide and valerate.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of<br>
this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the<br>
compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus,<br>
irrthe methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall<br>
encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound<br>
specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed,<br>
but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the<br>
patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and preption of suitable prodrug<br>
derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard,<br>
Elsevier, 1985. In addition to salts, the invention provides the esters, amides, and<br>
other protected or derivatized forms of the described compounds.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral<br>
center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess<br>
two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be<br>
understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the<br>
scope of the present invention. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the<br>
compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the<br>
present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with<br>
water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also<br>
intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
one or more compounds of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier and optionally additional pharmaceutical agents such as H1<br>
antagonists or SSRIs. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such<br>
as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed release<br>
and sustained release formulations), powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions<br>
or suspensions (including syrups and emulsions), metered aerosol or liquid sprays,<br>
drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral,<br>
intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for<br>
once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the<br>
active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot<br>
preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as<br>
tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol,<br>
talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other<br>
pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition<br>
containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation<br>
compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed<br>
evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily<br>
subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules.<br>
This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above containing from 5 to about 1000 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention. Examples include 5 mg, 7 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20<br>
mg, 35 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 120 mg, 150 mg, and so on. The tablets or pills<br>
of the disclosed compositions can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a<br>
dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or<br>
pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being<br>
in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be septed by<br>
an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the<br>
inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A<br>
variety of material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol<br>
and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present<br>
invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include,<br>
aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and<br>
flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil<br>
or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable<br>
dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and<br>
natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the<br>
invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by<br>
conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may<br>
be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by<br>
enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be<br>
resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the<br>
formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such<br>
as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by<br>
fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may<br>
also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by<br>
chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the<br>
compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a<br>
single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of<br>
two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can<br>
be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasai vehicles, or via<br>
transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be<br>
administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration<br>
will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active<br>
drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or<br>
necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can<br>
also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation,<br>
starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners,<br>
natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium<br>
stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and<br>
the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar,<br>
bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar<br>
vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of<br>
phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phophanaylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are<br>
coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble<br>
polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with<br>
palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of<br>
a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric<br>
acid, polyoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-<br>
linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment of ADHD is required.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 1 to<br>
1,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions are<br>
preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0,5.0,10.0,15.0, 25.0, 50.0,<br>
100, 250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of<br>
the dosage to the subject to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily<br>
supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight<br>
per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.02 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day, and especially from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times<br>
per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled<br>
in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration,<br>
the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of<br>
the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular patient being<br>
treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in the<br>
need to adjust dosages.<br>
2. Combination Therapy<br>
The disclosed compounds are useful in combination with other therapeutic<br>
agents, including H1 receptor antagonists, H2 receptor antagonists, and<br>
neurotransmitter modulators such as SSRIs and non-selective serotonin re-uptake<br>
inhibitors (NSSRIs).<br>
Methods are known in the art for determining effective doses for therapeutic<br>
and prophylactic purposes for the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions or the<br>
disclosed drug combinations, whether or not formulated in the same composition.<br>
For therapeutic purposes, the term "jointly effective amount" as used herein, means<br>
that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in<br>
combination, that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system,<br>
animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor<br>
or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or<br>
disorder being treated. For prophylactic purposes (i.e., inhibiting the onset or<br>
progression of a disorder), the term "jointly effective amount" refers to that amount of<br>
each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that<br>
inhibits in a subject the onset or progression of a disorder as being sought by a<br>
researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, the delaying of which<br>
disorder is mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of one or more histamine<br>
receptors. Thus, the present invention provides combinations of two or more drugs<br>
wherein, for example, (a) each drug is administered in an independently<br>
therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount; (b) at least one drug in the<br>
combination is administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or sub-prophylactic<br>
if administered alone, but is therapeutic or prophylactic when administered in<br>
combination with the second or additional drugs according to the invention; or<br>
(c) both drugs are administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or sub-<br>
prophylactic if administered alone, but are therapeutic or prophylactic when<br>
administered together. Combinations of three or more drugs are analogously<br>
possible. Methods of combination therapy include co-administration of a single<br>
formulation containing all active agents; essentially contemporaneous administration<br>
of more than one formulation; and administration of two or more active agents<br>
separately formulated.<br>

BIOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
In Vitro<br>
Transfectlon of cells with human histamine receptor<br>
A 10 cm tissue culture dish with a confluent monolayer of SK-N-MC cells was<br>
split two days prior to transfection. Using sterile technique the media was removed<br>
and the cells were detached from the dish by the addition of trypsin. One fifth of the<br>
cells were then placed onto a new 10 cm dish. Cells were grown in a 37°C<br>
incubator with 5% CO2 in Minimal Essential Media Eagle with 10% Fetal Bovine<br>
Serum. After two days cells were approximately 80% confluent. These were<br>
removed from the dish with trypsin and pelleted in a clinical centrifuge. The pellet<br>
was then re-suspended in 400 µL complete media and transferred to an<br>
electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm gap between the electrodes (Bio-Rad #165-<br>
2088). One microgram of supercoiled H, receptor cDNA was added to the cells and<br>
mixed. The voltage for the electroporation was set at 0.25 kV, the capacitance was<br>
set at 960 µF. After electroporation the ceils were diluted into 10 mL complete<br>
media and plated onto four 10 cm dishes. Because of the variability in the efficiency<br>
of electroporation, four different concentrations of cells were plated. The ratios used<br>
were; 1:20,1:10,1:5, with the remainder of the cells being added to the fourth dish.<br>
The cells were allowed to recover for 24 hours before adding the selection media<br>
(complete media with 600 µL G418). After 10 days dishes were analyzed for<br>
surviving colonies of cells. Dishes with well isolated colonies were used. Cells from<br>
individual colonies were isolated and tested. SK-N-MC cells were used because they<br>
give efficient coupling for inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The clones that gave the<br>
most robust inhibition of adenylate cyclase in response to histamine were used for<br>
further study.<br>
[3H]-N-methylhistamine binding<br>
Cell pellets from histamine H3 receptor-expressing SK-N-MC cells were<br>
homogenized in 20 mM TrisHCL/0.5 mM EOTA. Supernatants from a 800 g spin<br>
were collected, recentrifuged at 30.000 g for 30 minutes. Pellets were re-<br>
homogenized in 50 mM Tris/5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Membranes were incubated with<br>
0.8 nM [3H]-N-methylhistamine plus/minus test compounds for 45 min at 25°C and<br>
harvested by rapid filtration over GF/C glass fiber filters (pretreated with 0.3 %<br>
polyetnylenimine) followed by four washes with ice cold buffer. Filters were dried,<br>
added to 4 mL scintillation cocktail and then counted on a liquid scintillation counter.<br>
Non-specific binding was defined with 10 µM histamine. The pK, values were<br>
calculated based on a Kd of 800 pM and a ligand concentration ([L]) of 800 pM<br>
according to the formula:<br>
In Vivo<br>
Elucidation of oral absorption and blood-brain barrier penetration profiles of H3<br>
receptor antagonists in the rat<br>
A rat in vivo system was used to determine the blood-brain barrier penetration<br>
profiles and kinetics of various H, receptor antagonists after single bolus oral<br>
administration.<br>
Female Sprague Oawley Rats (~300 gram body weight) were housed in<br>
accordance with institutional standards and allowed to acclimate for at least 7 days<br>
prior to the study. Each H3 antagonist was formulated in 0.5% hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for oral dosing. The test compound was<br>
administered to each of eight animals as a single oral dose of 10 mL/kg (10 mg/kg).<br>
Remaining dosing solution was retained for analysis. Two animals from each<br>
original group of eight were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation at t = 1, 6, 24, and 48<br>
hours. After each animal was euthanized, 0.1 mL of its blood was sampled via<br>
cardiac puncture, and its brain was removed via dissection of the cranial bones and<br>
placed in a pre-weighed 50 mL conical tube on dry ice.<br>
The blood was added to 0.3 mL of 6% trichloroacetic acid, and the acidified<br>
sample was vortexed and then centrifuged (5 minutes at 14,000 rpm in a<br>
microcentrifuge). The clear supernatant was retained for analysis. The frozen brain<br>
was weighed, homogenized in 6% trichloroacetic acid (3 mL/g wet weight of tissue),<br>
and then centrifuged. The clear supernatant was retained for analysis. The<br>
supematants from the blood and brain samples were analyzed by liquid<br>
chromatography with mass spectral detection utilizing selective reaction monitoring<br>
(LC-MS/MS). The LC method used a Phenomonex Polar RP column (2 x 50 mm)<br>
and a linear solvent gradient of water and acetonitrite (both 1 % in acetic acid).<br>
Graphs of H3 receptor antagonist concentration versus time for blood and<br>
brain were generated from the LC-MS/MS results. The mean residency time (MRT)<br>
of the H3 receptor antagonist in blood or in the brain, was calculated from the ratio<br>
of the area under the first moment curve (AUMC) to the area under the<br>
concentration time curve (AUC): AUMC/AUC. The Blood Bran Barrier index was<br>
calculated from the log of AUCtu/AUCblood.<br>
