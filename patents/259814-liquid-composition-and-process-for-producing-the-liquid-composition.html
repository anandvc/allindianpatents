SPECIFICATION<br>
LIQUID COMPOSITION, PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE LIQUID COMPOSITION, AND ECTOPARASITE CONTROLLING AGENT FOR USE IN<br>
MAMMALS AND AVIANS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a liqiiid composition in which a dye is excellent in stability against light and/or heat, to a process for producing the liquid composition, and to an ectoparasite controlling agent for use in mammals and avians.<br>
BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
As for the formdations of agricultural chemicals (pharmaceutical compositions) or the like, in some cases, dyes are added to the formialations from the viewpoint of easier discrimination of formulations, prevention of misingestion, or the like.<br>
Such dyes are organic colorants, which are generally unstable against light or heat.<br>
For the powdered or particulate formulations, a solid substance in the formulation acts as a covering to protect against the light, and thus there is only a very small possibility of there being a problem in terms of the stability of the dye against Hght.<br>
[0003]<br>
However, in the liquid formulations containing no solid, even in the case of using a light-resistant container, or the like, slight penetrated light frequently decomposes<br><br>
the dye in many cases.    Further, in a case where a liquid formulation containing a dye is kept at a high temperature over a long period of time, the dye is decomposed by heat in some cases.    In addition, in such a case, a liquid composition having an original color tone can not be obtained, and further, a product from the decomposition of the dye causes adverse effects on the efficacy in some cases.<br>
[0004]<br>
Relating to the present invention. Patent Document 1 describes a formulation containing a: an agonist or antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors for insects, b: water, c: non-cyclic alcohols, d: coloring agents, and the Hke, in predetermined ratios.<br>
However, this document has no description on the selection of a solvent to be used to enhance the stability against light and/or heat of the colorir^ agent.<br>
[0005]<br>
Furthermore, Patent Document 2 describes a formulation for percutaneous control of parasitic insects and mites against humans, which has the composition as follows: (i) an agonist or antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the insects at a concentration of 0.0001 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation; (ii) a solvent in a group of cyclic carbonate esters at a concentration of 2.5 to 99,9999% by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation; (iii) in some cases, other solvents in a group of alcohols at a concentration of 0 to 95% by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation, and (iv) in some cases, other auxiliary agents selected from the group consisting of a thickening agent, a spreading agent, a coloring agent, an anti-oxidant, a swelling agent, a preservative, a tackifier, and an emulsifier at a concentration of 0 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of tiae formulation.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, the formulation (composition) as described in this document contains<br><br>
no water.    Furthennore, this document has a description indicating that a colorii^ agent may be contained in the formulation, but has no disclosure on a specific example showing that a coloring agent is added to the formulation.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0097]<br>
Next, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present invention is not to be limited to the following Examples in any case.<br>
[0098]<br>
(Examples 1 to 12, and Comparative Examples 1 to 12)<br>
The liquid compositions of Examples 1 to 12, and Comparative Examples 1 to 12 were prepared in a method represented by the following method B.    In Examples 1 to 12 and Comparative Examples 1,2,4 to 12, a liquid composition in which each of ftie components was uniformly dissolved was obtained.    However, in a case of the liquid composition of Comparative Example 3, a heterogeneous mixture in which the<br><br>
component (a) was not completely dissolved was obtained.<br>
[0099]<br>
Method A: As shown in FIG 1, by sequentially adding predetemiined amounts of the component (c), the component (b), the component (f), the component (e), and (d) water to the component (a), and mixing them^ a liquid composition was prepared.<br>
Method B: As shown in FIG 2, by sequentially adding predetemiined amounts of the component (c), the component (b), and the component (f), to the component (a), and mixing them, and then adding an aqueous solution obtained by dissolving a dye as the component (e) in distilled water to the mixture, and mixing them, a liquid composition was prepared.<br>
[0100]<br>
In the preparations of the liquid compositions of Examples 1 to 12, and Comparative Examples 1 to 12, the kinds and amounts (parts by weight) of the component (a) through the component (f) to be used, and preparation methods thereof are summarized in Table 1.<br>
[0101] [Table 1]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0102]<br>
In Table 1, as the component (a) through the component (e), the foIIo-wing ones were used.<br>

[0103]<br>
(Experimental Example 1) Test on stability agmnst light and heat<br>
The liquid compositions of Example 2 and Comparative Example 1 were put<br><br>
into a mono-layered polyethylene botlle having high light transmittance state, and jiept in a dark room at room temperature, and a dark room at a high, temperature of 54°C for 2 weeks.    On the other hand, the liquid compositions of Example 2 and Comparative Example 1 were put into a mono-layered bottle having high light transmission, made of polyethylene, and exposed to solar light.    After 12 days or 2 weeks of solar light exposure, the color of the liquid preparation was evaluated in accordance with a Munsell color system by visual examination.    The evaluation results are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0104] [Table 2]<br><br><br><br>
[0105]<br>
As shown in Table 2, the liquid composition of Example 2 was remarkably excellent in heat stability (in a case where it was kept in a dark room at 54°C for 2 weeks) and light stability (in a case where it was exposed to light for 12 days), as compared with the liquid composition of Comparative Example I in which 32.26 parts by weight of N-methylpyrrolidone was used instead of 32.26 parts by weight of propylene carbonate.<br>
[0106]<br>
(Experimental Example 2) Test on stability of the formulation (cooling test)<br>
After cooling the liquid compositions of Examples 3 to 12 and Comparative Examples 2 to 12 at -5°C, the presence or absence of separation and precipitation of the active ingredient was observed.    A case where phase separation did not occur was evaluated as O, and a case where phase separation occurred was evaluated as x.    In addition, after a small amount of a piece of active ingredient crystal was added, the presence or absence of the crystal growth of the active ingredient was investigated.   As a result of visual examination, a case where crystal growth was absent was considered as ©I a case where little crystal growth was perceived, but the solution became a uniform<br>
solution ag^ when the temperature was returned to room temperatmre was considered as O, a case where crystal growth was perceived, but the solution became a substantially uniform solution when the temperature was returned to room temperature was cor^idered as A; and a case where crystal growth was perceived, and the solution did not become a uniform solution even when the temperature was returned to room temperature was considered as x.    The evaluation results are shown in Table 3. [0107]<br><br><br>
[01 OS]<br>
As shown in Table 3, the hquid compositions of Examples 3 to 7, 9, and 10 had no phase separation even when they were cooled to -5 °C, and had no crystal growth of an active ingredient if a piece of active ingredient crystal was added.<br><br>
The liquid compositions of Examples 8,11, and 12 had no phase separation even when they were cooled to -5°C, and had little crystal growth perceived if a piece of active ingredient crystal was added, but they became uniform solutions by returning the temperature to room temperature.<br>
The liquid compositions of Comparative Examples 4 to 7, and 10 had no phase separation when they were cooled to -5°C, but had crystal growth perceived if apiece of active ingredient crystal was added.    The Hquid compositions of Comparative Examples 7 and 9 did not become uniform solutions even by returning the temperature to room temperature.<br>
The liquid compositions of Comparative Examples 2, 85,9,11, and 12 had phase separation, when they were cooled to -5°C.<br>
[0109]<br>
(Experimental Example 3) Test of dye dissolution {Comparative Experiment 1)<br>
By Method A, we tried to prepare a liquid composition having the same constitution as for the liquid composition prepared in Example 1.   That is, a non-uniform solution was obtained by adding 0.94 parts by weight of Pluronic PE6400 (manufactured by BASF), 8.64 parts by weight of acetamiprid, 0.0078 parts by weight of Food Yellow No. 4, O.0OO2 parts by weight of Food Blue No. 1, and 0.002 parts by weight of Pood Red No. 40 to 32.26 parts by weight of y-butyrolactone and 57.66 parts of dipropylene glycol.    In order to dissolve the msoluble dye, 0.49 parts by weight of distilled water was added thereto, and nuxed by means of a Three-One Motor, but the uniformity was not unproved, and the non-uniform solution remained as it was.<br>
[0110]<br>
The dissolution state and colors of the dye m the liquid composition obtained in<br><br>
Example 1, and the liquid composition obtained in Comparative Experiment 1 were observed by visual examination.    The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0111] [Table 4]<br><br><br><br>
[0112]<br>
As shown in Table 4, it was found that even for the liquid compositions having the same formulation, if the component (c), the component (b), the component (f), and the component (e) were sequentially added to the component (a), a non-uniform liquid composition was obtained, while if an aqueous solution obtained by preliminarily dissolving the component (e) in distilled water was added to a mixed solution of the component (a), the component (c), the component (b), and the component (f), and mixed, a uniform liquid composition was obtained.<br>
[0113]<br>
(Experimental Example 4) Test on efficacy using a dog against fleas<br>
(1) Preparation of liqiiid composition<br>
(Example 13)<br>
By adding 0.94 parts by weight of a surfactant (Pluronic PE6400, manufactured by BASF), and 0.49 parts by weight of water to a solution obtained by dissolving 8.64 parts by weight of acetamiprid to a mixed solvent of 32.26 parts of y-butytolactone and 57.66 parts by weight of dipropylene glycol, and mixing and dissolving them by means of a Three-One Motor, a uniform solution (liquid composition) was obtained.<br>
[0114] (Comparative Example 13)<br>
By adding 1.03 partsby weight of a surfactant (Pluronic PE6400, manufactured by BASF), and0.54partsby weight of water to a mixed solvent of 35.31 parts by weight ofy-butyrolactone and 63.12partsby weight of dipropylene glycol, and mixing and dissolving them by means of a Three-One Motor, a uniform solution (liquid composition) was obtained.<br>
[0115]<br><br>
(2) Test on efficacy<br>
Predetermined liquid preparations were spot-on administered to six dogs liaving various body weights, and a day before the test days (2,9, 16,23, and 30 days after administration), predetermined numbers of fleas {Ctemcephalidis felis) were innoculated to the six dogs.<br>
After a predeteunined numbei of days had passed after administration (treatment), the numbers of parasitic fleas on the dogs were investigated, and the mortality rates were determined on the basis of the following equation.<br>
Mortality rate (%)={(X-Y)/X)xlOO<br>
wherein X represents the numbers of parasitic fleas on the dogs that had been treated with the liquid composition of Comparative Example 13, and Y represents the numbers of parasitic fleas on the dogs that had been treated ■with the liqmd composition of Example 13.    The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
[0116]<br><br><br><br>
From Table 5, it was found that the ectoparasite-controlling liquid composition of Example 13 has an excellent flea-controlling effect.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY [0118] The liqmd composition of the present invention provides excellent dye stability<br>
against light and/or heat.<br>
