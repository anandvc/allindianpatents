PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"STRUCTURE OF MOTORCYCLE SEAT"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1 1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
As structure of a motorcycle seat, there is known "a seat device of a motorcycle" in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. 11-227654 (hereinafter, referred to as "prior art").<br>
The above-described prior art is, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the same official gazette, for the seat 30 obtained by covering the upper surface of the cushion material 32 superimposed on the seat bottom plate 31 (for the reference numeral, the one described in the official gazette has been quoted, and so forth) with skin 33. [00033<br>
US 6022073 disclose a bicycle saddle shell and fabric/film covering attached to a perimeter of the shell. The said prior art also claims a plurality of elastomers having plurality of cavities and projections for selected engagement between one another.<br>
US 6022703 primarily and specifically relates to a bicycle saddle with adjustable cushion to provide customized resilient properties. On the other hand the present invention claims a seat structure for a motorcycle while discussing the cushioning properties based on the compression forces being acted upon the seat at the hip point and sub-hip point.<br>
The manner in which a rider sits on the bicycle saddle and the manner the rider sits on a motorcycle seat and this difference results in variation in profiles of compression forces acting on the bicycle saddle and motorcycle seat, thus requiring different cushion adjusting properties.<br><br><br><br><br>
[Problems to be solved by the InventionJ<br>
In recent years, the desire to reduce the cost of a motorcycle grows and for this reason, the seat 30 has also been requested to reduce the price. In order to reduce the seat 30 in price, there can be conceived to adopt low-priced material for cushion material 32.<br>
In a case, however, where simply low-priced material is adopted as the cushion material 32, there occurs a phenomenon in which a repulsion force of the cushion material 32 is deteriorated because of a decrease in hardness thereof as compared with its initial hardness while it will be continuously used, a so-called "permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon" . As a result, the ride quality of the seat 30 is deteriorated. [0004]<br>
The above-described "permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon" is a phenomenon in which hardness of the cushion<br><br><br>
[0007]<br>
[Means for solving the Problems]<br>
The present inventors have found that (1) since of the cushion material, particularly hip points., against which a rider"s hips directly strike, are frequently subjected to a greater compressive force than other portions, there is the strong tendency of the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon to occur, and that (2) emphasis can be laid on the ride quality at the hip points for securing by focusing attention to the fact that the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon is prone to occur at the commencement of use of the seat has been started, and thereafter becomes comparatively stable.<br>
More specifically, according to Claim 1, there is provided a motorcycle seat in which the upper surface of the cushion material superimposed on the seat bottom plate is covered with skin material, this seat being characterized in that an amount of compression of the cushion material at the hip points, against which the rider"s hips directly strike, has been set to be larger than an amount of compression at the portion against which the hips do not strike, [0008]<br>
The hardness of the cushion material itself is kept set to be low in advance, and the amount of compression of the cushion material at the hip points is increased to a high density, whereby it is possible to set the hardness of that portion to a preferred magnitude at the commencement of use of the seat. Therefore, it is possible to secure ride quality of the seat at the hip points at the commencement of use of the seat.<br>
4<br><br>
[0009]<br>
After the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs in the cushion material at the hip points, the hardness of the cushion material itself at the hip points is deteriorated as compared with at the commencement of use of the seat.<br>
Originally, however, the hardness of the cushion material "itself is comparatively low, and makes little difference even if the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs." Moreover, since the" amount of compression of the cushion material is set to belarge for obtaining a high density so as to have satisfactory ride quality even after the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs, sufficient hardness of the cushion material at the hip points has been secured even if the permanent-set -in-fatigue phenomenon occurs . As a result, it is possible to secure the ride quality of the seat at the hip points after the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs.<br>
In this manner, the ride quality of the seat can be always secured. [0010].    .<br>
According to another emodiment the seat bottom plate has a plurality of reinforcement ribs provided on the upper surface, that the cushion material has an underside fqrmed into a substantially plane shape, and concave portions, which the reinforcement ribs enter, formed in portions corresponding to the plurality of reinforcement ribs, and that of these plurality of concave portions, the concave  portions at sites corresponding to the hip points have been  made shallower than<br><br>
the concave portions which do not correspond to the hip points. [0011]<br>
Since the concave portions at the sites which correspond to the hip points are shallow, foamed material sufficiently spreads all over portions corresponding to between the above-described concave portions of cavities even if foamed material is not poured in sufficient abundance in cavities of a mold. Therefore, the shape of the underside of the cushion material can be molded in accordance with the request, and the thickness of the cushion matirTal can " be" secured. Since the material cost can be reduced by  reducing usage of foamed material, it is possible to manufacture the cushion material at low cost, and as a result, to reduce the cost of the seat. [0012]<br>

13 mounted to the front fork 12; a handlebar 14 coupled to the front fork 12; a power unit 15 mounted onto the rear part of the vehicle body frame 11 so as to be swingable vertically; a rear wheel 16"mounted to the power unit 15; a rear cushion unit 17, from which the rear end portion of the power unit 15 is suspended; a housing box 18 mounted to the upper portion in the rear part of th"e vehicle body frame 11; and a seat 19 arranged on the housing box 18, mounted so as to be able to be opened and closed. [0014]<br>
The power unit 15 consists of a water-cooled type engine 21 in the front part and a power transmission mechanism 22 in the rear part. The engine 21 is arranged substantially horizontally with the cylinder head turned forward. [0015]<br>
Farther, the motorcycle 10 is obtained by  covering the vehicle body frame 11 with a body cover 30. The body cover 30 is composed of: a front cover 31, with which the front part of the head pipe lla is covered; a leg shield 32 for covering forward the rider"s legs; a step floor (low deck type feet placing plate) 33 on which the rider"s feet are placed; right and left floor side covers 34 extending from the outer edge of the step floor 33 downward; an undercover 35 for covering between the lower edges of these floor side covers 34; a seat lower cover 36, with which the periphery of the front half of the housing box 18 is covered; a rear cover 37, with which the periphery of the rear half of the housing box 18 and the rear part of the vehicle body are covered; and right and left side<br><br><br>
covers 38 extending from these seat lower cover 36   and rear<br>
cover 37 downward.<br>
[0016]<br>
Such a motorcycle 10 has: (D an ignition key cylinder 41 arranged in the portion of the leg shield 32; © a fuel tank 42 and a fuel pump 43 arranged below the step floor 33; (3) a tray (not shown) provided at the upper end portion in the rear part of the vehicle body frame 11, and a radiator reservoir tank 44, a battery 45 and a control unit 46 arranged on this tray. [00171<br>
In the figures, a reference numeral 51 designates a handlebar grip; 52, a brake lever; 53, a meter; 54, a mirror; 55, an indicator; 56F, a handlebar front cover; 56R, a handlebar rear cover; 57, a headlamp; 58, a horn; 59, a front fender; 61, a power unit mounting hanger; 62, an engine starting kick pedal; 63, an air cleaner; 64,a carburetor; 65, an engine cooling radiator; 66, an engine exhaust pipe; 67, an exhaust muffler; 71, a main stand; 72, a rear fender; 73, a tail lamp; 74, an indicator; 75, a carrier; and He, a helmet. [0018]<br>
Fig. 2 is a left side cross - sectional view showing a seat according to the present invention, showing cross - sectional structure of a seat 19 at the center of the vehicle width.<br>
The seat 19 is obtained by covering the upper surface of the cushion material 90 superimposed on the seat bottom plate 80 with skin material 100, and folding back the end portion of this skin material 100 so as to lay it on top of the underside<br><br>
of the edge of the seat bottom plate 80 for fixing. The seat bottom plate 80 is a hard resin article, the cushion material 90  is a foamed material article such as flexible urethane resin foamed material, and the skin material 100 is a synthetic leather article. [0019]<br>
The seat bottom plate 80 has an opening 81 formed at the intermediate portion in a back-and-forth direction and at the central portion of the vehicle width in such a manner that this opening 81 is opened and closed by a movable plate 82 which is vertically movable. In a case where a helmet He is housed in the housing box 18 shown in Fig. 1 and the seat 19 is closed, when the movable plate 82 strikes against the apex of the helmet He, the movable plate 82 moves upwardly. Accordingly, there is no possibility that the seat 19 interferes with the helmet He. A reference numeral 111 designates a packing, and 112, a seat lock striker. [0020]<br>
Fig. 3 is a bottom view showing a seat according to the present invention, showing a plurality of reinforcement ribs 84 . . . (. . . indicates a plurality, and so forth) provided over the entire upper surface (rear surface of the figure) of the seat bottom plate 80. The plurality of reinforcement ribs 84 . . . have been formed in a shape of lattice having the substantially same pitches in the bottom surface view.<br>
Further, this figure shows a hip point HP1 and a sub-hip point HP2 wider than the hip point HP1 in imaginary lines. The hip point HP1 and the sub-hip point HP2 mean" a substantially<br><br>
square range in the bottom surface view. In this case, the hip point HPl means sites, against which the rider"s hips directly strike, of the seat 19, and the sub-hip point HP2 means a surrounding site of the hip point HPl. [0021]<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross - sectional view taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 3, showing a plurality of reinforcement ribs 84... integrally formed on the upper surface 83 of the seat bottom plate 80. The reinforcement ribs 84. . . are reinforcement members for securing stiffness of the seat bottom plate 80. The reinforcement ribs 84. . . are provided on the upper surface 83 instead of the underside of the seat bottom plate 80. This is because the appearance quality when the seat 19 is opened is enhanced. [0022]<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view taken on line 5-5 of Fig. 4, showing cross - sectional structure of the seat 19 at a site which does not correspond to the hip point HPl. [0023]<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view taken on line 6-6 of Fig. 4, showing cross - sectional structure of the seat 19 at a site which corresponds to the hip point HPl. [0024]<br>
Fig. 7 is an exploded view showing a seat according to the present invention.<br>
The plurality of reinforcement ribs 84 . . . which have been caused to stand up upwardly from the upper surface 83 of the seat bottom plate 80 are substantially constant in height.<br>
1)<br><br>
The cushion material 90 is constructed such that the underside 91 is formed into a substantially plane shape and that portions corresponding to the plurality of reinforcement ribs 84... are formed with a plurality of concave  portions 92H. . . , 92A. . . which the reinforcement ribs 84 . . . enter. These plurality of concave portions 92H..., 92A... are run-off for causing the reinforcement ribs 84 . . . to run off when the cushion material 90 is superimposed on   the seat bottom plate 80.<br>
The present invention is characterized in that of the plurality of concave portions 92H. . . , 92A. . . , concave portions (hereinafter, referred to as "hip point concave portions 92H. . . ") at a site corresponding to the hip point HP1 have been made shallower than concave portions (hereinafter, referred to as "other concave portions 92A, . . ") which do not correspond to the hip point HP1. This point will be described in detail in the following Fig. 8 . [0025]<br>
Figs. 8(a) to 8(c) are conceptual views for the seat according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 8(a) shows the seat 19 before assembly. The height of the reinforcement ribs 84. . . protruding from the seat bottom plate 80 is Hi. On the other hand, the thickness of the cushion material 90 is Tl, the depth of the hip point concave portions 92H. . . in the cushion material 90 is Dl, and the depth of the other concave portions 92A... is D2.<br>
The depth D2 of the other concave portions 92A... has been set so as to become substantially same as the height HI of the reinforcement ribs 84..., and the depth Dl of the hip<br><br><br>
point concave portions 92H... has been set to become smaller than the depth D2 of the other concave portions 92A. ... In other words, the hip point concave portions 92H... have been made shallower than the other concave portions 92A... and smaller tha.ii the height HI of the reinforcement ribs.<br>
The depth Dl of the hip point concave portion 92H preferably corresponds to 5 to 20% of the thickness Tl of the cushion material in size, and more preferably corresponds to 10% to 15% of the thickness T of the cushion material. [0026]<br>
Fig. 8 (b) shows a state in which the cushion material 90 is superimposed on the seat bottom plate 80 and the upper surface of this cushion material 90 is covered with the skin material 100.<br>
From this state, the seat 19 is manufactured by mounting while compressing the cushion material 90 onto the seat bottom plate 80 side.<br><br>
Aforcepl (compressive force pi) compressing the cushion material 90   at the hip point HP1 is greater than a force p2 (compressive force p2) compressing the cushion material 90 at the sub-hip point HP2, and the compressive force p2 is greater than a force p3 (compressive force p3) compressing the cushion material 90 at a portion against which the hips do not strike. That is, there is formed relationship of p1 &gt; p2 &gt; p3 , and these compressive forces p1 to p3 are distributed loads. This result is shown in the following Fig. 8(c). [0027]<br>
Fig. 8 (c) shows the seat 19 completed. The compressive<br>
13<br><br>
forces pi to p3 have been set as shown in the above - described Fig. 8(b), whereby an amount of compression CI of the cushion material 30 at the.hip point HPl has been set to be larger than an amount of compression C2 at the portion against which the hips do not strike (CI &gt; C2). Accordingly, the thickness T2 of the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl after compressed is smaller than the thickness T3 of the portion against which the hips do not strike (T2 
As described above, the amount of compression CI of the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl is increased to obtain a high density, whereby it is possible to enhance the hardness of the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl. [0028]<br>
Generally, in a case where simply low-priced material is adopted as the cushion material 90, there occurs a phenomenon in which a repulsion force of the cushion material 9 0 is deteriorated because of a decrease in hardness thereof as compared with its initial hardness while it will be continuously used, a so-called "permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon". As a result, the ride quality of the seat 19 is deteriorated. The "permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon" is a phenomenon in which the hardness of the cushion material 90 is deteriorated. [0029]<br>
In such cushion material 90, the permanent - set-in -fatigue phenomenon is prone to occur at the commencement of use, and thereafter becomes comparatively stable. In<br><br><br>
consideration of this point, the hardness of the cushion material 90 can be set so as to have satisfactory ride quality after a fixed permanent-set - in-fatigue phenomenon occurs.<br>
When, however, the hardness of the cushion material 90 is set in accordance with the ride quality after the permanent set in fatigue, the seat 19 at the commencement of use is too high.in hardness , and becomes a so-called excessively hard seat. More specifically, when the hardness is set high so as to have satisfactory ride quality after the "permanent- set-in-fatigue phenomenon" occurs, the seat is too hard and is inferior in xide quality at the commencement of use. [0030]<br>
The seat 19 is manufactured by covering the upper surface of the cushion material 90 superimposed on the seat bottom plate 80 with  skin material 100 and mounting while compressing the cushion material 90 to the seat bottom plate 80 side. The hardness SI of the cushion material 90 itself is kept set to be low in advance, and an amount of compression CI of the cushion material 90 is set to be large in the manufacturing process, whereby it is possible to increase the density of the cushion material 90 . In this manner, it is set to a high density, whereby it is possible to set the hardness of the cushion material 90 to a preferred magnitude at the commencement of use of the seat, and therefore, to secure the ride quality of the seat 19 at the commencement of use of the seat. [0031]<br>
However, it is troublesome to increase the amount of compression of the entire cushion material go, and the man-hour<br>
15<br><br>
is increased. Since of the cushion material 90,   particularly a hip point HPl, against which the rider " s hips directly strike, is frequently subjected to a greater compressive force than other portions, there is the strong tendency of the "permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon" to occur. [0032]<br>
Thus, the present invention is characterized in that (1) the hardness SI of the cushion material 90 itself is kept set to be low in advance, (2) the amount of compression CI of the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl is set to be larger than an amount of compression C 2 of a portion, against which the hips do not strike so that a high density is obtained, whereby (3) hardness S2 of a portion at the hip point HPl has been set to a preferred magnitude at the commencement of use of the seat.<br>
In other words, an attempt has been made to place emphasis on   the ride quality of the seat 19 at the hip point HPl for securing. Since of the cushion material 90, the amount of compression CI of the portion at the hip point HPl has been made to be large, it is possible to easily compress and to maintain the conventional manufacturing cost.<br>
In this case, "the hardness SI of the cushion material 90 itself set to be low in advance" is smaller than "hardness S2 of the portion at the hip point HPl at the commencement of use of the seat which has been set by compressing the cushion material 90 by the amount of compression CI" (SI 
The foregoing description will be summarized. The<br><br>
hardness SI of the cushion material 90 itself is kept set to be low in advance, and the amount of compression CI of the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl is increased so as to obtain a high density , whereby hardness S2 of that portion can be set to a preferred magnitude at the commencement of use of the seat. Accordingly, it is possible to secure the ride quality of the seat 19 at the hip point HPl at the commencement of use of the seat. [0034]<br>
After the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs in the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl, the hardness of the cushion material 90 itself at the hip point HPl is deteriorated as compared with at the commencement of use of the seat.<br>
Originally, however, the hardness S1 of the cushion material 90 itself is comparatively low, and makes little difference even if the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs. In other words, a ratio of deterioration in hardness of the cushion material 90 can be decreased (endurance deterioration level is improved).<br>
Moreover, since the amount of compression CI of the cushion material 90 is set to be large for obtaining a high density so as to have satisfactory ride quality even after the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs, the hardness makes little difference even if the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs. Therefore, the hardness of the cushion material 90 at the hip point HPl has been sufficiently secured. As a result, it is possible to secure the ride quality of the<br><br>
seat 19 at the hip point HP1 after the permanent - set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs.<br>
In this manner, the ride quality of the seat 19 can be always secured. [003.5]<br>
Generally in a case where foamed material is poured into a mold to mold the cushion material 90, when the concave portions 92H..., 92A... are deep, foamed material may be difficult to sufficiently spread all over a portion corresponding to between concave portions in cavities of the mold. As a result, of the underside 91 of the cushion material 90, foaming is more difficult to be performed in the surface portion between the concave portions than in the interior. When the foaming on the surface portion is incomplete, the shape of the underside 91 cannot be molded in accordance with the request, and the thickness of the cushion material 90 may not be secured. [0036]<br>
In order to foam so as to reliably make the shape of surface portions between the concave portions 92H. . . , 92A. . . ready, an abundance of foamed material can be poured into the cavities. However, use of the abundance of foamed material prevents cost reduction from being furthered.<br>
Moreover, since an abundance of foamed material is concentrated on a surface portion of the cushion material 90 because of the foaming property of the foamed material, the surface portion has a higher density than the interior. When the concave portions 92H. . . , 92A. , . are deep, the surface area of the surface portion having the high density is increased<br><br>
by that amount. As a result, the weight of the cushion material<br>
90 will be increased.<br>
[0037]<br>
In contrast, in the present invention, of the concave portions 92H. . . , 92A. . . formed in the cushion material 90, the depth Dl of at least the hip point concave portions 92H. . . has been made small.<br>
Since the hip point concave portions 92H. . . are shallow, the foamed material sufficiently spreads all over portions corresponding to between the concave portions 92H... of the cavities even if an  abundance of foamed material is not poured into the cavities. Therefore, the shape of the underside 91 can be molded in accordance with the request, and the thickness of the cushion material 90 can be secured. Since the material cost can be reduced by reducing the usage of the foamed material, the cushion material 90 can be manufactured at low cost, and as a result, the cost of the seat 19 can be reduced. [0038]<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the surface area of the cushion material 90, which has a high density, is reduced by an amount, by which the hip point concave portions 92H... have been made shallow. By this amount, the weight of the cushion material 90 can be reduced. Moreover, the ride quality of the seat 19 can be secured without changing appearance, shape and thickness of the seat 19. [0039]<br>
In this respect, in the above-described embodiment according to the present invention, the motorcycle 10 is not<br><br>
limited to the scooter type motorcycle." [0040]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effects due to the above-described structure.<br>
SINCE an am.ount of compression of the cushion material at a hip point, against which the rider" s hips directly strike, has been set to be larger than an amount of compression at a portion, against which the hips do not strike, even when low-priced material has been adopted as the cushion material, the hardness of the cushion material itself is.kept set to be low in advance, and the amount of compression- of the cushion material at the hip point is increased to set to a high density, whereby it is possible to set the hardness of that portion to a preferred magnitude at the commencement of use of the seat. Therefore, it is possible to secure the ride quality of the seat at the hip point at the commencement of use of the seat. [0041]<br>
On the other hand, after the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs in the cushion material at the hip point, the hardness of the cushion material itself at the hip point is deteriorated as compared with at the commencement ot use of the seat.<br>
Originally, however, the hardness of the cushion material itself is comparatively low, and makes little difference even if the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs. In other words, a ratio of deterioration in hardness<br><br><br>
of the cushion material can be decreased {endurance deterioration level is improved). Moreover, since the amount of compression of the cushion material is set to be large for obtaining a high density so as- to have satisfactory ride quality even after the permanent-set-in-fatigUe phenomenon occurs, sufficient hardness of the cushion material at the hip point has been secured even if the permanent-set-in-fatigue phenomenon occurs. As a result, it is possible to secure the ride quality of the seat at the hip point. [0042]<br>
By securing the hardness of the cushion  material at the hip point in this manner, it is possible to always secure the ride quality of the seat. Moreover, by  the adoption of low-priced material as the cushion material, the seat can be manufactured at low price. [0043]<br>
According to another emhdement the seat bottom plate is, on  the Upper surface, provided with a plurality Qf reinforcement ribs; the underside of the cushion material is formed into a substantially plane shape; portions, of the underside, which correspond to the plurality of reinforcement ribs are formed with concave portions, which the reinforcement ribs enter; and, of these plurality of concave portions, the concave portions at a site corresponding to the hip roint are made shallower than the concave portions which do not correspond to the hip point. Therefore, even if foamed material is not poured in sufficient abundance in cavities of a moid, foamed material can be caused to sufficiently spread all. over portions<br>
21<br><br>
corresponding to between the concave portions at a site which<br>
corresponds to the hip point of cavities.<br>
Therefore, the shape of the underside of the cushion<br>
material can be molded  in accordance with the  request, and the<br>
thickness of the cushion material can be secured. Moreover,<br>
since the material cost can be reduced by reducing usage of<br>
foamed material, it is possible to manufacture the cushion<br>
material at low cost, and as a result, to further reduce the<br>
cost of tghe seat_<br>
