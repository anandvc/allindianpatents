				<td>In this Unit two cavities are provided for the insertion of the frames carrying the negative and the polymer to be exposed, to utilize the Ultra-Violet rays fully. The unit is flexible to use plate polymers or liquid polymers in both the cavities or both simultaneously, one in each of the cavities. Mechanical pressure is applied on the negative and the polymer by using a frame, wherein the negative and the polymer are placed on the glass to be exposed to the ultraviolet rays and is locked by the male counter part of the frame using tempered metallic strips and is clamped in position to be air-tight. This unit can also be used for readying the negatives of which the impression is desired on the polymer by obtaining a paper print-out of the desired material and pressing it against a negative plastic and exposing it to the ultra-violet rays .</td>

				<td>This invention relates to the improvements incorporated in a PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT.<br>
Conventional PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNITS hitherto available in the market use vacuum pressure for the flawless contact between the Negative and the Polymer on which the impression is desired. This is a very costly affair owing to the pump and the other allied infrastructure required to create this vacuum. This constituted for nearly 70% of the cost of unit, consequent to which, it was beyond the reach of a common man. The question of affordability to a common man was just ruled out, owing to the cost factor of this specialized equipment. One of the motives of this 'DUAL -CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT* is the substitution of this costly pressure maintenance activity by some other ideal means, costing less and at the same time being equally effective. In this direction, a lot of research work was done and ultimately a suitable mechanical locking device was arrived at for the effective butting of the Negative and the polymer, the functional aspects of which is enumerated later in this specification. The incorporation of this salient feature in this 'DUAL -CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT' has reduced the cost of the   equipment drastically, to the extent that it   is  now<br><br>
within the reach of a small industrialist/businessman.<br>
Another major feature of this newly invented 'DUAL - CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT5 is that the conventional Photo Polymer Exposure Units hitherto available in the market have provision for exposure of a single frame only. Whereas in this 'DUAL - CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNir two cavities are provided, as the title of the Invention suggests. The idea here is, to capitalize on the same amount of Ultra-Violet Rays utilized. The exposing area is doubled thereby reducing the power cost by 50% and also results in more quantum of work, being done for the same time utilized. In the conventional machines, the Ultra-Violet Rays are exposed in only one direction, whereas in this 'DUAL -CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT', the exposure of the Ultra-Violet Rays is directed towards two frames carrying the polymers, by providing two cavities, one on the top and the other on the bottom of the Ultra-Violet Tube, as enumerated in the figure (A) of the accompanying drawing, thereby making full use of the emanated energy. Further, this also speeds up the process, where the quantum of work is more, as two jobs could be done simultaneously, by making use of both the frames.<br><br>
In the Conventional Photo Polymer Exposure Units, the Negative to be ucied fat getting the impression on the polymer has to be processed separately elsewhere, as there is no provision for the same in their equipments. Whereas this newly invented 'DUAL - CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT', has been designed and developed in such a manner that it can take care of this activity also. This feature is accomplished in this Machine by pressing a paper print out of the desired matter against the Negative Plastic sheet and exposing it to the Ultra-Violet rays for few minutes. In view of the various features that have been integrated to be available on this Machine, this Invention has been appropriately titled as 'DUAL - CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT'.<br>
Another major advantage of this newly invented 'DUAL - CAVITY MULTI PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT', is the operational flexibility. This unit can accommodate, both, plate polymer and also liquid polymer in the two cavities that have been provided for. To be precise, in the Cavity (2) &amp; as well as Cavity (3), frames can be inserted, which carry plate polymer or liquid polymer and alternatively both of them can accommodate plate polymers or liquid polymer, to suit the requirement Further, one of these can carry a plate polymer and the other can carry the frame with liquid polymer,<br><br>
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIT<br>
This newly invented "DUAL-CAVITY MULTI-PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT" basically consists of a fabricated Metallic Cabinet (1) of Fig (A) of the accompanying drawing sheet, within which, the whole unit is assembled. (2) &amp; (3) are the two cavities, which carry channels for the easy Sliding of the frames that are subjected to exposure of the Ultra-Violet Rays. (4) of the accompanying drawing depicts the tube that emanates the Ultra-Violet rays, which is ideally and centrally located within the cabinet, to ensure that the ultra-violet rays access both the frames that are inserted into the top and the bottom cavity. All the accessories for the Ultra-Violet Tube i.e., the chokes, starters, etc., are all assembled within the Cabinet (1), so that the whole unit is compact and has an elegant look. (5) of Fig.(A) is a mechanical timer which facilitates pre-setting of the time, fixing the duration of exposure of the Ultra-Violet Rays to the frames thereby eliminating the compulsion of any manual watch by the operator, as he can concentrate on other work, as the process is on. (6) of Fig. (A) is the on-off switch.<br>
Fig.(B) on the accompanying drawing depicts the frame (7) in which the negative and the polym er plate are to be embedded. The frame has a glass base to expose it to the Ultra-Violet rays and is hollow, within which the negative and the polymer plate are placed, sandwiched and locked by a male counterpart of the frame, which carries tempered metallic strips (8), which are locked at either ends by clamps (9), which ensure that the negative and the polymer plate are intact within the frame, restricting any movement and arresting air flow into the frame, being the ideal conditions under which the negative and the polymer<br><br>
plate are to be exposed to the ultra-violet rays and this mechanism replacing the costlier vacuum-pressure system of the conventional models.<br>
Whenever a liquid polymer is used in this newly invented "DUAL-CAVITY MULTI-PURPOSE PHOTO POLYMER EXPOSURE UNIT, instead of a frame as shown in Fig. (B) of the accompanying drawing, a pair of plain glasses constituting a frame is used. One of the plane glasses carries a hollow compartment, within which the liquid polymer is poured and the negative placed on it. However, before doing so, it is advisable to remove air bubbles if any in the liquid polymer, failing which the quality of the output may suffer. Once the negative is butted to the liquid polymer, the top glass is placed on it and is suitably clamped, to be air-tight. This glass frame now could be placed in either of the cavities and the switch (6) switched on, to start the process. Before doing so, the process time is set bv usins the Medianim! Timer<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
