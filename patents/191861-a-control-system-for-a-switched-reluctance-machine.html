ANGLE  CONTROLLER  FOR  A  SWITCHED  RELUCTANCE  DRIVE UTILIZING A HIGH FREQUENCY CLOCK<br>
The present invention generally relates to a control system and, in particular, to a control system for use in a switched reluctance drive.<br>
In general, a reluctance machine can be an electric motor in which torque is produced by the tendency of its movable part to move into a position where the reluctance of a magnetic circuit is minimized, i.e. the inductance of the exciting winding is maximized.<br>
In one type of reluctance machine the energisation of the phase windings occurs at a controlled frequency. These machines may be operated as a motor or a generator. They are generally referred to as synchronous reluctance motors. In a second type of reluctance machine, circuitry is provided for detecting the angular position of the rotor and energizing the phase windings as a function of the rotor's position. This second type of reluctance machine may also be^a motor or a generator and such machines are generally known as switched reluctance machines. The present invention is generally applicable to switched reluctance machines, including switched reluctance machines operating as motors or generators.<br>
Figure 1 shows the principal components of a switched reluctance drive system 10 for a switched reluctance machine operating as a motor. The input DC power supply 11 can be either a battery or rectified and filtered AC mains. The DC voltage provided by the power supply n. is switched across the phase windings of the motor 12 by a power converter 13 under the control of the electronic control unit 14. The switching must be correctly synchronized to the angle of rotation of the rotor for proper operation of the drive 10.  As such, a<br><br>
rotor position detector 15 is typically employed to supply signals corresponding to the angular position of the rotor. The output of the rotor position detector 15 may also be used to generate a speed feedback signal.<br>
The rotor position detector 15 may take many forms. In some systems, the rotor position detector 15 can comprise a rotor position transducer that provides output signals that change state each time the rotor rotates to a position where a different switching arrangement of the devices in the power converter 13 is required. In other systems, the rotor position detector 15 can comprise a relative position encoder that provides a clock pulse (or similar signal) each time the rotor rotates through a preselected angle.<br>
In systems where the rotor position detector 15 comprises a rotor position transducer, failure of the rotor position transducer circuitry to properly provide output signals representative of the angular position of the rotor can seriously degrade the performance or, in the worst case, render the motor inoperable. In some circumstances, a controller 14 attempting to control a machine based on faulty rotor position transducer outputs could potentially damage both the piachine and the remainder of the control circuitry.<br>
The importance of accurate signals from the rotor position detector 15 may be explained by reference to Figures 2 and 3. Figures 2 and 3 explain the switching of a reluctance machine operating as a motor.<br>
Figure 2 generally shows a rotor pole 20 approaching a stator pole 21 according to arrow 22. As illustrated in Figure 2, a portion of a complete phase winding 23 is wound around the stator pole 21. As discussed above, when the portion of the phase winding 23 around stator pole 21 is energised, a force will be exerted on the<br><br>
rotor tending to pull rotor pole 20 into alignment with stator pole 21.<br>
Figure 3 generally shows the switching circuitry in power converter 13 that controls the energisation of the portion of the phase winding 23 around stator pole 21. When power switching devices 31 and 32 are switched ON, phase winding 23 is coupled to the source of DC power and the phase winding is energised.<br>
In general, the phase winding is energised to effect the rotation of the rotor as follows: At a first angular position of the rotor {called the turn-ON angle), the controller 14 provides switching signals to turn ON both switching devices 31 and 32. When the switching devices 31 and 32 are ON the phase winding is coupled to the DC bus which causes an increasing magnetic flux to be established in the motor. It is this magnetic flux pulling on the rotor poles that produces the motor torque. As the magnetic flux in the machine increases, electric current flows from the DC supply provided by the DC bus through the switches 31 and 32 and through the phase winding 23. In some controllers, current feedback is employed and the magnitude of the phase current is controlled by chopping the current by switching one or both of switching devices 31 and/or 32 on and off rapidly.<br>
In many systems, the phase winding remains connected to the DC bus lines (or connected with chopping if chopping is employed) until the rotor rotates such that it reaches what is referred to as the rotor "freewheeling angle." When the rotor reaches an angular position corresponding to the freewheeling angle (position 24 in Figure 2) one of the switches, for example 31, is turned OFF. Consequently, the current flowing through the phase winding will continue to flow, but will now flow through<br><br>
only one of the switches (in this example 32) and through only one of the return diodes (in this example 34) . During the freewheeling period there is little voltage differential across the phase winding, and the flux remains substantially constant. The motor system remains in this freewheeling condition until the rotor rotates to an angular position known as the "turn-OFF" angle (represented by position 25 in Figure 2) . When the rotor reaches the turn-OFF angle, both switches 31 and 3 2 are turned-OFF and the current in phase winding 23 begins to flow through diodes 33 and 34. The diodes 33 and 34 then apply the DC voltage from the DC bus in the opposite sense, causing the magnetic flux in the machine (and therefore the phase current) to decrease.<br>
The energisation of the phase windings in a switched reluctance motor depends heavily on accurately detecting the angular position of the rotor.<br>
Known encoder systems for switched reluctance drives are often limited because of the costly electronics required to rapidly process digital signals provided by an incremental position encoder such that the phase energisation occurs at the appropriate times. For example, in known systems, an incremental position encoder may be used that provides a relatively large number of digital clock pulses each complete revolution of the rotor. In systems that do not use costly electronic circuits or high speed microprocessors, it is often difficult and expensive to process the large number of digital pulses provided by the incremental encoder to properly synchronize the energisation of the phase windings with the angular position of the rotor.<br>
The present invention is defined in the accompanying independent claims. Preferred features of the invention are recited in the claims respectively dependent thereon.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a control system for a switched reluctance machine, the machine comprising a rotor, a stator and at least one phase winding, the said control system comprising : a rotor position encoder operable to generate output signals indicative of the position of the rotor relative to the stator; a frequency multiplier comprising : an increment detector arranged to receive first and second output signals from the encoder, the increment detector being operable to generate a series of clock pulses, each clock pulse being defined by a change in state of the first output signals; a counter having a reset input arranged to receive the series of clock pulses, the counter being resettable in response to each pulse generated by the increment detector, the counter having a clock input coupled to a system clock, the counter being operable to provide an output (C) that varies in proportion to the frequency of the series of clock pulses from the increment detector; and a programmable divider coupled to receive the output of the counter and the system clock, the programmable divider being operable to provide at its output a clock signal, having a frequency proportional to the frequency of the second output signals and a fraction of the frequency of the system clock, wherein the relationship of the frequency of the clock signal to the frequency of the system clock is controlled by the output of the counter; and angle control means responsive to the clock signal and first output signals from the encoder to generate switching signals for controlling the energisation of at atleast one phase winding.<br><br>
The present invention extends to a low cost, efficient, control system for a switched reluctance drive that generates a high resolution incremental pulse train from a position encoder. A method of, and circuit for, using this control system to generate a high resolution position signal which can be used to control the firing signals for a switched reluctance drive is also disclosed. This control system allows for cost-effective control of a switched reluctance drive without the necessity of a fast microprocessor.<br>

Illustrative embodiments of the invention are de¬scribed below as they might be implemented to control a switched reluctance drive. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are de¬scribed in this specification.<br>
In general, the present invention comprises an improved control system and position encoder for controlling the operation of a switched reluctance machine as illustrated generally in Figure 4. Referring to Figure 4, the system comprises a controller 40 that receives signals corresponding to the angular position of the rotor from rotor position encoder 42. In response to the signals from encoder 42, the controller 4 0 generates switching signals (or firing signals) that determine the switching state of the power switching devices (not illustrated in Figure 4) that control energisation of the phase windings.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4, the signals provided by encoder 42 to the controller 40 comprise two sets: a first set 42a and a second set 42b. The signals that comprise the first set 42a are of a first resolution that corresponds to the absolute position of the rotor in that the signals from set 42a may be used to define the actual rotor position within any span of 360 electrical degrees. The signals that comprise the second set 42b are of a second resolution that corresponds to the incremental position in that the signals that comprise set 42b provide an integral number of pulses per revolution which indicate the relative movement of the rotor but give no indication of its absolute position. In the embodiment of Figure 4, the resolution of the first set is less than<br><br>
the resolution of the second set and the output signals from encoder 42 that comprise the first and second sets 42a-b comprise a series of digital pulses.<br>
Figures 5a-5c illustrate in greater detail the construction of encoder 42. In the embodiment of Figures 5a-5c, the encoder 42 comprises a cup-vane 50 and sensors 51a, 51b and 51c and 52a and 52b. Figure 5a provides a perspective view of a cup-vane 50. Figures 5b and 5c illustrate cup-vane 50 in greater detail and show the positioning of sensors 51a-c and 52a-b in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 5b, cup-vane 50 is a dual resolution cup-vane that includes two sets of teeth 53 and 56. The first set of teeth 53 includes eight projecting teeth 53a-h that define eight light blocking regions corresponding to teeth 53a-h (referred to herein as "mark" regions) and eight light transmissive regions 54a-h (referred to as "space" regions) . In the embodiment of Figure 5, the teeth 53a-h are all of the same width and are sized such that the angular extent of the mark regions is substantially equal to the angular extent of the space regions.<br>
Figures 5b and 5c illustrate how the first set of teeth 53 may be used to provide a digital encoder of a first resolution that provides signals indicative of the absolute position of the rotor relative to the stator. Referring to Figure 5b, three sensors 51a-51c are used in conjunction with the cup-vane 50 to provide the first set of digital signals. In the embodiment of Figures 5a-5c, the three sensors 51a-51c comprise slotted optical sensors that are positioned substantially 15° degrees apart as is illustrated in Figure 5c. The optical sensors 51a-51c are further positioned such that they receive the eight teeth 53a-h.  In operation, each of the<br><br>
three sensors 51a-51b provides a digital signal of a first logic level (e.g., logic "1") when one of the teeth 53a-h is in the slot associated with that sensor and provides a digital signal of a second logic level (e.g., logic "0") when the slot associated with that sensor is empty. Accordingly, as the teeth 53a-h rotate past the sensors 51a-51c, the outputs from the. sensors together provide an indication of the absolute position of the rotor.<br>
Referring back to Figure 5b, the cup-vane 50 also includes a second set of teeth 56. In the embodiment of Figures 5a-5c, the second set of teeth 56 comprises one-hundred and twenty teeth of equal width that are sized to provide one-hundred and twenty light blocking regions (referred to as "mark" regions") and one-hundred twenty light transmissive regions (referred to as "space" regions).<br>
Figures 5b and 5c illustrate how the second set of teeth 56 may be used to provide a digital encoder of a second resolution that provides signals indicative of the incremental position of the rotor. Referring to Figure 5b, two sensors 52a and 52b are used in conjunction with the cup-vane 50 to provide the second set of digital signals. In the embodiment of Figures 5a-5c, the two sensors 52a-52b comprise slotted optical sensors that are positioned substantially 0.75° degrees apart as is illustrated in Figure 5c. The optical sensors 52a-52b are further positioned to receive the one-hundred and twenty teeth that comprise the second set of teeth 56. The sensors 52a and 52b operate in a manner similar to that of sensors 51a-51c described above. By monitoring the outputs of sensors 52a and 52b in the manner described below it is possible to generate a digital pulse each time the rotor rotates through a 0.75° high<br><br>
resolution increment of rotation. The digital pulses that are provided from this monitoring of sensors 52a and 52b constitute an example of a second set of signals of a second resolution.<br>
It should be noted that the particular encoder 42 illustrated in Figures 5a-5c is exemplary only and that the present invention is applicable to other types and configurations of vanes, sensors and to other forms of position encoders. For example, the number of teeth per set could be changed, as could the number and location of the sensors without departing from the scope of the present invention. It will be appreciated that the spacing of the sensors in Figure 5c is such that their output signals follow a particular sequence as the mark and space regions pass. If there is insufficient space, for example, to array all or both sensors in a limited angular extent, it will be apparent that each sensor may be located in its respective position but positioned relative to neighbouring sensors so that it is influenced by a separate mark/space, but at the appropriate time. If it is considered that the mark regions have a pitch circle diameter (PCD) the position of one sensor on a PCD can be varied by one or more mark/space pitches without changing the timing of the waveforms produced by the sensors. Moreover, it is not essential that a cup-vane be used or that the vane define light blocking and light transmissive portions. Other types of vanes and sensors could be used. For example, the vane could be constructed of magnetic mark regions and non-magnetic space regions and the sensors could comprise Hall-effect devices. Similarly the vane could comprise teeth of ferromagnetic material and the sensors could each be a form of reluctance sensor. Other means of deriving the digital  signals  include  regions  of  capacitance  of<br><br>
inductance that vary and a suitable sensor to detect the changes. Also light reflective variations instead of regions of varying light transmissivity could be used. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the specific encoder illustrated in Figures 5a-5c but can apply to other encoders that produce a first set of signals of a first resolution. It is also applicable to encoders that additionally produce a second set of signals of a second resolution.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the controller 4 0 of the present invention receives the two sets of output signals from encoder 42 and utilizes those signals to control the switching of power devices to control the energisation of the phase windings of a switched reluctance machine. It may be noted that the second set of digital output signals 42b from encoder 42 is provided to a frequency multiplier 44. Frequency multiplier 44 receives the second set of signals of the second resolution from encodQ,r 42 and generates a high frequency clock signal (HF clock) that is used by angle controller 4 6 to control energisation of the phase windings of the machine. Although not illustrated in Figure 4, embodiments are envisioned where frequency multiplier 44 receives the first set of signals from encoder 42 and generates the HF clock from the first set of signals.<br>
Figures 6a-6b provide examples of circuitry that may be used to implement the frequency multiplier 44 of Figure 4. Figure 6a illustrates circuitry that may be used when the second set of signals from encoder 42 is provided to frequency multiplier 44. Figure 6b illustrates circuitry that may be used when the first set of signals 42a from encoder 42 is provided to frequency multiplier 44.<br>
Referring to Figure 6a, the second set of digital<br><br>
signals 42b is applied to an increment detector 60 that monitors the signals from sensors 52a and 52b and produces a signal that changes state when the rotor has rotated a predetermined high resolution increment of rotation. In the embodiment of Figure 6 an increment detector 6 0 comprises an exclusive OR (XOR) gate. The output from increment detector 60 is a series of clock pulses where each clock pulse corresponds to a high resolution increment of rotation of the rotor. The series of clock pulses from increment detector 60 is applied to the Reset input of an eight bit up-counter 61. Accordingly, up-counter 61 receives the series of digital pulses derived from sensors 52a and 52b that consists of a predetermined number of pulses for each complete rotation of the rotor. The clock input of eight bit up-counter 61 is coupled to the system clock through a -v- N divider 63, where N is an integer, having the value 4 in this example. The system clock may have a frequency that is very high with respect to the frequency of the digital pulses that comprise the second set of digital signals provided by encoder 42. In operation, the up-counter 61 is reset each time a rising or falling edge of a pulse occurs in the second set of digital signals provided ,by encoder 42. The up-counter 61 will then count up in response to the divided system clock to provide a clocked output that corresponds to the angular speed of the rotor. For example, if the rotor is rotating at a first speed (e.g., a relatively slow speed) the counter 61 will be reset relatively infrequently and thus the maximum count of counter 61 will be relatively high. If the angular speed of the rotor increases to a second speed, counter 61 will be reset on a more frequent basis and thus the maximum output of counter 61 will be relatively low.  In general, the output of counter 61 will be an<br><br>
eight bit maximum count value that corresponds inversely to the speed of the motor. The maximum output of the counter 61 may be provided to the programmable divider 62 in response to a pulse in the second set of digital signals provided by encoder 42.<br>
The eight-bit digital output from up-counter 61 is applied to the control input C of a programmable divider 62. Programmable divider 62 receives as its Clock input the system clock. As those skilled in the art will recognize, programmable divider 62 is of standard construction and provides an output clock signal that has a frequency that is a fraction of the frequency of the signal applied at its Clock. In the embodiment of Figures 6a-6b, the programmable divider is of the type where the output clock frequency is equal to the input clock frequency divided by the number represented by the eight-bit digital word received at the Control input. Accordingly, the programmable divider 62 provides a high frequency digital clock signal (HF clock) that has a frequency that varies proportionally with the frequency of the digital pulses that comprise the second set of signals from encoder 42. Since the frequency of the digital pulses that comprise the second set of signals from encoder 42 varies proportionally with the speed of the motor, the HF clock signal has a frequency that varies proportionally with the speed of the motor.<br>
Although not shown in Figures 6a-6b, in embodiments where the frequency of the divided system clock is such that up-counter 61 would likely overflow between successive clock pulses from encoder 42, the number of bits of the up-counter 61 may be increased accordingly.<br>
Figure 6b illustrates circuitry for implementing frequency multiplier 44 when the first set of signals 42a from encoder 42 is provided to the frequency multiplier<br><br>
44. The circuitry of Figure 6b operates in a manner similar to that described above with respect to Figure 6a with the exception that the counter 61 is reset each time the rotor rotates through an increment of rotation as reflected by signals 42a.<br>
Three-input exclusive gate 64 receives the signals 42a and provides an output signal which changes state each time any one of the signals 42a change state. When the circuitry of Figure 6b is utilized, the high resolution pulse train 42b from encoder 42 is unnecessary for a functioning drive. In such embodiments a simple RPT, providing only one pulse train, could be used.<br>
Referring back to Figure 4, the HF clock signal from the frequency multiplier 44 is applied to an angle control circuit 46 and a chopping control circuit 47. In general, the angle control circuit 46 and chopping control circuit 47 respond to the HF clock and to the signals from encoder 42 to provide switching signals for the power devices. The chopping controller 4 7 may be used at relatively low angular speeds when chopping methods are effective for controlling the current in the phase windings, and angle controller 46 may be employed when the speed of the machine is relatively high and chopping control is ineffective. In general, the angle controller 46 and chopping controller 47 receive digital rotor position signals derived from encoder 42 and compare the rotor position signals from the encoder 42 with signals corresponding to turn-ON and turn-CFF angles for the desired operating conditions. When the appropriate controller determines that the rotor is at the position corresponding to the turn-ON angle, a switching signal is generated for the appropriate power device to energize the appropriate phase winding.  When<br><br>
the rotor position signals derived from encoder 42 indicate that the rotor is at the position corresponding to the turn-OFF angle, the appropriate controller generates a switching signal to turn off the appropriate switching device and de-energize the appropriate phase winding. If chopping control is used, the controller 47 may generate chopping signals between the period defined by the turn-ON and turn-OFF angles to control the current in the phase winding. These techniques are familiar to those skilled in the art of switched reluctance drives.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4, the turn-ON and turn-OFF information is provided by a control law table 48 that includes as its input signals representing the torque-demand and the actual speed of the machine. In the embodiment of Figure 4, the control law table 48 may comprise a look up table that includes a pre-interpolated matrix in an EPROM containing appropriate turn-ON and turn-OFF data for several speed/torque-demand combinations. This turn-ON and turn-OFF data may be empirically derived or calculated. Alternative embodiments are possible in which the control law table 4 8 comprises a sparse matrix and a microprocessor or ASIC is used to calculate the appropriate turn-ON and turn-OFF angles in real time.<br>
Figure 7a generally illustrates an example of the circuitry that may be used to implement the angle controller 46 of Figure 4. As illustrated in Figure 7a, angle controller 46 may comprise an eight-bit up counter 70 that receives as its Clock input the HF clock signals discussed above in connection with Figure 6. As indicated, the HF clock signal comprises a series of clock pulses that occur at a frequency that is proportional to the angular speed of the rotor. The Reset input of up-counter 70 is coupled to receive at<br><br>
least one signal from the first set of signals which, in the embodiment of Figure 7a is the pulse train from sensor 51a.<br>
Referring to Figure 7a, the eight-bit counter 70 is reset each time an edge occurs in the output of pulse train 51a. In the embodiment of Figure 7a, the up-counter 70 is reset on each rising edge, although embodiments are envisioned where counter 70 is reset on a falling edge. Because the counter 70 is reset at a point corresponding to an absolute position of a rotor pole relative to a stator pole, and because the counter 70 is clocked with an HF clock signal that varies in proportion to the speed of the rotor, the running output of up-counter 70 will be a digital word that increases over time, where the value of the digital word corresponds to the position of the rotor. This is illustrated generally by the Angle Control Ramp signal of Figure 7b.<br>
Referring to Figure 7b, the output of the up-counter 70 is represented by the Angle Control Ramp. As Figure 7b indicates, at a point in time TQ, counter 70 will receive a rising edge of signal 51a. This rising edge will reset counter 70 causing its output to drop to zero. As discussed above, the occurrence of this rising edge indicates that a rotor pole has reached an absolute position relative to a stator pole. After counter 70 is reset, its output will increase in response to each HF clock pulse until the next occurrence of a rising edge from, pulse train 51a at time T4. Because the HF clock pulse occurs at a rate that is proportional to the speed of the rotor, the output of the counter 70 will correspond to the position of the rotor.<br>
Referring back to Figure 7a, the digital output from counter 70, which corresponds to rotor position, may be<br><br>
used to generate switching signals, or firing signals, to control the power devices to energize or de-energize the phase windings of interest. In particular, in Figure 7a, an eight-bit comparator 72 is used to sense when the rotor has reached the turn-ON angle such that the appropriate switching device can be turned on. As illustrated in Figure 7a, comparator 72 receives at its A input an eight-bit word from control law table 4 8 corresponding to the desired turn-ON point. Comparator 72 receives at its B input the running output from counter 70. In the embodiment of Figure 7a, comparator 72 provides a logic high output whenever its A input exceeds its B input. Accordingly, the output of comparator 72 will be a logic high ("1") whenever the signal corresponding to the desired turn-ON angle exceeds the running output of counter 70 and logic low ("0") at all other times. This signal is inverted by an inverter to provide a digital signal that is logic high whenever the running output of counter 70 exceeds the signal representing the turn-ON angle.<br>
In a similar manner comparator 74 receives at its A input a digital word from control law table 48 corresponding the desired turn-OFF angle and at its B input the running output of counter 70. Like comparator 72, comparator 74 produces an output signal that is logic high ("1") whenever the word at its A input exceeds the word at its B input. Accordingly, comparator 74 will produce a digital signal that is logic low (0) whenever the output from counter 70 exceeds the signal corresponding to the turn-OFF angle.<br>
The inverted output from comparator 72 and the output from comparator 74 are both applied to AND gate 75. Accordingly, AND gate 75 will provide a digital signal that is logic high only when the running output<br><br>
from counter 70 is greater than the signal representing the turn-ON angle and less than the signal representing the turn-OFF angle. This output signal from AND gate 75 can then be used to control the energisation of an appropriate phase winding by circuitry not illustrated in Figure 7a. The general operation of comparators 72 and 74 and AND gate 75 is illustrated in Figure 7b where the Output from AND Gate 75 represents a series of pulses that can be used to control energisation of the machine. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the exemplary control system of Figure 7a is basic, and does not include circuitry for implementing more complicated control functions, such as freewheeling. Such additional functions may be easily added to the circuit of Figure 7a (e.g. by adding another comparator) without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, Figure 7a illustrates control circuitry for only a single phase. The circuitry will generally be repeated for each phase of the motor and additional circuitry (not illustrated) will generally be required to change the edge which resets the angle control ramp from being reset on a rising edge to being reset on a falling edge when the drive moves from motoring to generating. For example, the circuitry of Figure 7a could be repeated with the up-counter 70 being reset by the pulse train from either sensor 51b or 51c. Techniques and circuitry for extending the controller of Figure 7a to multi-phase motors will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. Further, the control circuit of Figure 7a generally illustrates an angle controller. The controller could be modified to include a chopping circuit, which compares the actual current in the phase winding with a desired current during the interval between the turn-ON and turn-OFF<br><br>
angles, and chops the phase current whenever the actual current meets or exceeds the desired current.<br>
The controller of Figure 4 allows for effective control of a switched reluctance machine without costly absolute position encoders or costly processing circuitry. Accordingly, the controller of the present invention as represented by Figure 4 provides a low cost, efficient control system.<br>
It should be noted that the particular encoder 42 illustrated in Figures 5a-5c is exemplary only and that the present invention is applicable to other types and configurations of vanes, sensors and to other forms of position encoders. For example, the number of teeth per set could be changed, as could the number and location of the sensors without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Further alternative embodiments are possible in which use two incremental encoders with different resolutions or two absolute encoders with diffe.rent resolutions. Moreover, although the above embodiments of the present invention include a logic circuit, an ASIC or a microprocessor, those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention can be performed by a properly programmed microcontroller, a specific logic circuit, or analog circuitry.<br>
Although the invention has been described in terms of rotary machines, the skilled person will be aware that the same principles of operation can be applied to a linear position encoder to equal effect. For example, the skilled person will be aware that a reluctance machine (as with other types of electric machine) can be constructed as a linear motor. The moving member of a linear motor is referred to in the art as a rotor. The term "rotor" used herein is intended to embrace the<br><br>
moving member of a linear motor as well.<br>
Accordingly, the principles of the present invention, which have been disclosed by way of the above examples and discussion, can be implemented using various circuit types and arrangements. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that these and various other modifications and changes may be made to the present invention without strictly following the exemplary application illustrated and described herein and without departing from the scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims.<br><br><br>
