				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pH sensitive nanoparticulate delivery system for the administration of peptide hormones and drugs In particular it relates to oral insulin administration<br>
Background of invention<br>
Diabetic melltus is a common endocrine disorder, which poses a serious healthcare challenge The global prevalence of diabetes is estimated to increase from 4% in 1995 to 5 4% by the year 2025 The WHO predicted that the major burden would occur in the developing countries There will be a 42% increase from 51 to 72 million in the developed countries and 170% increase from 84 to 228 million m the developing countries The countries with the largest number of diabetic people are and will be in the year 2025, India, China and United States (King H, Aubert RE and Herman WH , Diab Care 1998 21,1414-1431)<br>
Diabetes melhtus is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by varying degrees of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, which leads to disturbance in glucose homeostasis The disease if uncontrolled, is characterized by high blood glucose levels, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, feeling of tiredness, blurred vision and weight gain or weight loss Diabetes melhtus is classified into two major forms, Type I (IDDM) characterized by insulin deficiency resulting from pancreatic beta-cell destruction mediated by autoimmune disorder and Type II (NIDDM) is generally characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, which may range from predominant insulin secretory defect with insulin resistance<br>
Insulin is the most important drug for diabetic therapy and insulin administration is the treatment for all Type-I diabetic patients and many Type II diabetic patients Especially for type I diabetic patients the only treatment currently available is taking exogenous insulin injections<br>
Efforts for developing oral insulin delivery system are one of the most active research areas for the past many years At present the diabetic patients who are dependent on insulin for normal life have to take multiple subcutaneous injections a day, which is a painful ordeal Moreover daily injections can lead to infections and thereby other relat4ed<br>
complications So many efforts are being taken worldwide to realize an alternative insulin delivery route other than parenteral Being protein insulin cannot be given orally which is the most accepted route of drug intake The major hurdles in getting insulin into the systemic circulation orally are digestive acids, enzymes and poor absorption via the intestinal wall Packaging the drugs along with protease inhibitors or giving protective coating could enable protein-based drugs to survive the intestinal conditions, but it cannot aid them in crossing the gut lining To overcome these obstacles various polymers are tried for developing micro and nanoparticles as oral peptide earners It is reported that nanoparticles can easily reach the systemic circulation from the intestine via Peyer's patches<br>
In view of the above facts we have developed a fatty acid-polymenc nanoparticle based oral insulin formulation, which takes care of both the hurdles faced in oral protein delivery The polymer that is encapsulating the insulin is pH sensitive The lipid-polymer complex protects the insulin from the harsh gastro-intestinal environment and its nanomenc size helps to cross the intestinal barrier efficiently This nanoparticles has shown to have sustained - release property The nanoparticles are prepared by water-in-oil emulsion mechanism The polymers used m nanoparticle preparations include alginates, derivatised chitosan, derivatised pullulan, gellan, xanthan The preparation medium is oil The oils used are edible grade coconut oil, groundnut oil, rice bran oil, olive oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil etc individually as well as blends of vanous ratios of these oils or mixture of the essential contents of the oil namely fatty acids<br>

Detail Description of the invention<br>
The nanoparticles developed by this process are fatty acid nanoparticles and a polymer is used as a stabilizer and also to incorporate pH sensitivity so that these particles shrink in the gastric acidic pH thereby protecting the incorporated insulin These particles being also hydrophobic in nature and by virtue of their small size get absorbed through the intestinal cell wall and Peyer's patches These nanoparticles are novel and unique in the sense that polymer content is only 0 03-0 06g/g product and the polymer is hydrophilic in nature Due to its hydrophihc nature the drug is incorporated during the preparation process itself and a hydrophobic coating of fatty acids is also developed Due to its hydrophobic nature the particles are readily absorbed into the systemic circulation from the intestine via villi and Peyer's patches Only specific oil used in this preparation exhibit this property as trials were made from the usage of other oils in our laboratory, which had similar fatty acid composition The major component of these nanoparticles is fatty acids The polymer component is only 
The fatty acid component and polymer part is crosshnked using crosshnking agents which results in the formation of stable nanoparticles which is possessing both hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity<br>
The insulin-loaded nanoparticles developed were found to be very efficient The loading efficiency ranges from 50 to 80 % depending on the nature of insulin solution used for the particle preparation<br>
The size of the particles was determined by Transmission Electron Microscopy and was in the range of 30-100 nm, majority having size less than 100 nm (Figure attached)<br>
The particles show pH sensitivity, at gastric pH the particles will shrink and this<br>
protects the insulin from the acidic environment and the digestive enzymes	In   the<br>
intestine, being nanoparticles they get readily absorbed by the Peyer's patches in the ileum region (Figure attached) They get absorbed by villi also<br>
The activity of the loaded insulin was determined by ELISA and found that the loaded insulin retained 100% activity The efficacy of this formulation was studied in vivo using rat model The formulation was capable of lowenng the blood glucose level by over 50% in diabetic rats with a dosage of 6 IU/200 gm body weight The effect sustained for about 11-13 hours from the onset<br>
This is also demonstrated in pig model that the insulin-loaded nanoparticle when given orally is capable of reducing the blood glucose levels<br>
Stability Stability studies of biological activity of loaded insulin in nanoparticles have been performed upto six months and it has been observed to be 100% bioactive The stability data in the literature does not exist from other laboratories to our knowledge on search Further studies will be performed for longer duration<br>
Absorption Various groups have demonstrated the bioabsorption of insulin from oral insulin delivery systems with varied results (Ref 1-3) from 4 % to 21% in various species Our preliminary studies in rat model suggest up to 27% absorption which is supposed to be enhanced in higher species Our formulation seems to be providing enhanced absorption of insulin via absorption of nanoparticles<br>

In vivo experiments in diabetic rat model<br>
The in vivo experiments were done on male Wistar rats The rats were made diabetic using streptozotocm by giving an intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 50-mg/Kg-body weight of the rat<br>
The diabetic rats were orally given the nanoparticle placebo and insulin loaded nanoparticles at a dose of 3 and 6 IU/200 gm rat A diabetic control was also maintained during the experiments<br>
Results are shown in Fig 1<br>
Figure 1 Diabetic control, placebo and oral insulin formulation (at a dose of 3 and 6 IU/ 200 gm body weight of diabetic rat)<br>
Example 6<br>
In vivo experiments in normal pig<br>
The in vivo experiments were done on normal pigs also The effect of formulation was tested orally in normal conditions and also during intravenous glucose infusion For assessing the efficacy of the formulation in presence of extra glucose, first the pigs were given an oral dose of insulin formulation Then exactly 45 minutes later an intravenous glucose challenge was given (0 5g/Kg body wt) In a previous experiment it was found that the peak value of glucose following an intravenous challenge occurs at 15' after glucose infusion So the samples were collected at 15', 30', 60', 1, 2 and 3 hour It was found that in oral insulin given pigs the peak of glucose after 15 minutes was reduced than in the pigs without formulation<br>
This results shows that the insulin-loaded nanoparticles when given orally is capable of reducing the blood glucose levels<br>

Dye loaded nanoparticle was used for studying the mechanism of absorption of the nanoparticle via the Peyer's patches The experiment was done to understand the gastrointestinal uptake of the nanoparticles Fluorescein dye loaded nanoparticles was used for the study Experiment was done on a normal albino Wistar rat The rat was fasted for 20 hours with free access to water The rat was anaesthetized using xylazme (6 mg/kg body wt) by injecting intramuscularly Under anesthesia the abdominal area of the rat was cleaned and the hair was removed Then the abdomen was cut open by a midline incision to expose the intestine At the beginning of the small intestine a small incision was made and a catheter was inserted which was then secured to the intestine using a cotton umbilical tape At the end of the small intestine also a small incision was made and a catheter was inserted as mentioned above A saline drip set was attached to one end and the whole intestinal segment was flushed out with normal saline After flushing out<br>
the intestme a 20 ml aliquot of dye loaded nanoparticle suspension was infused Both ends of the intestinal segment was then sealed by clamping the catheter using artery forceps After two hours the dye solution was drained The small intestinal segment was then washed out with 200 ml of normal saline<br>
The rat was then sacrificed by Occipital Atlantal dislocation The intestinal tissue sections containing Peyer's patches were then collected in saline The tissues were sectioned using a cryostat microtome and viewed using a fluorescent microscope with UV filter It was proven that the nanoparticles are absorbed by Peyer's patches and as well as villi by the experiment as evidenced by the fluorescent microscopy photographs<br>
Results are shown in Figure 5<br>
