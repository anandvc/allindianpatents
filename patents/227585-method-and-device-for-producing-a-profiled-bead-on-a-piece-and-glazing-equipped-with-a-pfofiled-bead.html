				<td>Method and device for producing a profiled bead on a<br>
piece, and glazing equipped with a profiled bead<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a<br>
profiled bead on a piece, having the characteristics of<br>
the preamble of claim 1. It also relates to a suitable<br>
device for implementing the method, and to glazing that<br>
can be obtained using the method.<br>
Various methods for equipping solid pieces, and also<br>
window panes, for example glass and/or plastic window<br>
panes, with a plastic profiled bead, for example made<br>
of a thermoplastic elastomer, which sticks to one of<br>
the (main) faces of the piece are known. Applied to<br>
window panes near their edge, the profiled bead<br>
sometimes also covers the lateral face thereof. In this<br>
instance, the methods with which a smooth connection in<br>
continuity with the surface of the profiled bead with a<br>
main face of the piece untouched by this bead can be<br>
achieved are particularly beneficial.<br>
Document DE-C1-42 32 554 discloses a method of this<br>
nature in which a window pane is set down on a heated<br>
metal forming cradle and then provided, in an operation<br>
using a robot-guided nozzle, with a profiled bead<br>
having the desired cross section covering the edge of<br>
the upper main face and of its lateral face. The<br>
forming cradle may comprise an elastic rest, which is<br>
able to compensate for small dimensional differences<br>
between the window pane and the (forming cradle.<br>
Document DE-A1-41 03 047 describes a similar method for<br>
applying a framing profiled section to the edge of a<br>
window pane, in which method a trough-shaped forming<br>
tool is first of all filled with a partial quantity of<br>
the plastic, from which the framing profiled section is<br>
produced. Next, the window pane is placed on the tool<br>
and its main face is brought into contact with the<br>
plastic. Next, additional plastic is added using a<br><br>
nozzle, until the desired cross-sectional shape of the<br>
framing profiled section is achieved. The mold may be<br>
flexible, so that it can conform to the outline of the<br>
edge of the window pane. In each, case, however, it is<br>
also made up of a mold part with a fixed contour which<br>
may, if need be, remain by way of protection on the<br>
window pane until such time as this window pane is<br>
fitted.<br>
Document. DE-A1-43 26 650 Al describes another method<br>
for producing a profiled bead, which is deposited along<br>
the edge of a window pane using an extrusion nozzle<br>
with a mouth-shaped opening. The profiled bead may have<br>
a U-shaped or L-shaped cross section which covers at<br>
least, a main face on the side of the edge and the<br>
lateral face (narrow edge face) of the window pane<br>
which attaches thereto and which as appropriate<br>
attaches flat (as a continuity of the surface) with the<br>
other main face of the window pane.<br>
In the known methods, it is not possible, because of<br>
the dimensional discrepancy of the window panes and of<br>
their edges respectively, by comparison with the<br>
theoretical contour, to avoid the local formation<br>
between the mold, and respectively the mouth of the<br>
nozzle, and the face of the plate, of gaps via which<br>
the pressurized plastic that is to be fashioned<br>
escapes. This plastic can then stick at undesirable<br>
locations to the face of the plate. As a result,<br>
additional operations are required (removal of<br>
material, cleaning of window panes) which prove to be<br>
extremely troublesome and expensive, especially in<br>
fully mechanized working processes.<br>
Document DE-A1-10021808 discloses an injection mold<br>
designed to produce a flush-fitting molded seal on a<br>
plate of glass. The mold comprises a tolerance-<br>
compensating system arranged between an upper mold<br>
element, and a lower mold element, which accommodates<br><br>
the edge of the plate, forming a seal. This system<br>
comprises a thick shoe mounted on a spring or having a<br>
hollow space giving a little flexibility. The hollow<br>
space may be placed at a reduced pressure or filled<br>
with gas or liquid. With this technique, it is<br>
necessary to exert pressure on the glass plate, via the<br>
upper half mold, which pressure is transmitted by the<br>
glass to the shoe to form a leak tight seal.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing a profiled bead on a piece using a forming<br>
surface, in which method the conformation of the<br>
forming surface to the piece is further enhanced, and<br>
to provide a device which is particularly well suited<br>
to implementing the method.<br>
According to the invention, this objective is achieved,<br>
as far as the method is concerned, by the<br>
characteristics of claim 1. The characteristics of<br>
claim 11 disclose a corresponding device. The invention<br>
also relates to glazing having the characteristics of<br>
claim 22. The characteristics of the sub-claims<br>
attached to each of the independent claims disclose<br>
advantageous embodiments of these subjects.<br>
Good conformation of the forming surface around the<br>
entire contour or just part of the contour of the piece<br>
to be equipped with the profiled bead can now be<br>
obtained through the fact that a forming face is<br>
combined with a flat support that can be deformed by a<br>
fluid pressure (fluid is to be understood as meaning<br>
gases or liquids with equal preference), the forming<br>
face being pressed against the piece, or respectively<br>
against, its lateral face, by inflating the support once<br>
the piece has been fitted and fixed. The forming face<br>
may also, under the uniform pressure of the support,<br>
conform to any irregularities there may be in the face<br>
or laterl face of the piece facing it. Naturally, the<br>
piece itself is at the same time fixed in its position<br><br>
in an appropriate way, for example using opposed<br>
supports or mating rests, so that it cannot escape the<br>
pressure of the forming face by the pressure of the<br>
fluid.<br>
This method can be applied equally to the extrusion of<br>
the profiled bead in situ from a plastic using a<br>
relative movement between the extrusion nozzle and the<br>
edge o[ the piece or, respectively, the forming face<br>
applied thereto, and to the injection of a plastic into<br>
a closed mold (injection molding) which defines the<br>
desired profiled section contour. The latter method<br>
naturally assumes a precise matching of the pressures<br>
of the injection mechanism and support so that the<br>
latter does not give way under the injection pressure.<br>
A plastic here is to be understood as meaning any<br>
material with which a profiled bead, of defined and<br>
durable cross section, can be formed by extrusion or<br>
injection. As a general rule, use is made of polymer<br>
plastics, preferably thermoplastic polymers,<br>
elastomers, two-part polyurethane polymers, etc. These<br>
also exhibit satisfactory resistance to the high levels<br>
of stress encountered in use (changes in temperature,<br>
mechanical vibrations, solar radiation, etc.).<br>
The forming face may be secured as one constructional<br>
entity to the support, and may even form an integral<br>
part of the support. In one embodiment, a mold part<br>
comprising the forming face may be in the form of a<br>
relatively thin strip, flexible in the longitudinal<br>
direction but relatively rigid in the transverse<br>
direction and fixed, for example by bonding or<br>
vulcanizing, to a support in the form of a tube or<br>
flexible hose. The support for its part rests on a<br>
rigid support frame or the like, the periphery of which<br>
corresponds more or less to the line of the outline of<br>
the piece to be equipped with the profiled bead, for<br>
example a window pane. If need be, use may also be made<br><br>
of other cross sections which are stronger than the<br>
strips.<br>
In another embodiment, the mold part comprising the<br>
forming face is incorporated directly into the support.<br>
It is, for example, possible to extrude a profile in<br>
the form of a tube or a flexible hose, which<br>
incorporates, into a single piece, both the support,<br>
which has relatively thin walls that can be deformed<br>
under a fluid pressure, and the forming face which has<br>
a thicker cross section, externally shaped in the<br>
desired way.<br>
In a third alternative form, the forming face forms<br>
part of an independent mold part, separate from the<br>
support, which is positioned appropriately near the<br>
piece that is to be equipped with the profiled bead, in<br>
such a way that it can be pressed by the support<br>
against a face or a lateral face of the immobilized<br>
piece, in this particular instance, the mold part in<br>
its entirety may be fixed, for example when it is<br>
already in contact with the piece and provides the<br>
necessary conformation as a result of its elastic<br>
deformation alone, or alternatively it may be driven by<br>
the support from a lowered rest position into a raised<br>
position.<br>
In yet another alternative form, a mold part comprising<br>
the forming face with the required cross-sectional<br>
shape, may be fixed to a membrane the surface area of<br>
which is slightly greater than the face of the piece,<br>
or of the window pane respectively. In this case, only<br>
said mold part needs to conform, at one or several<br>
parts specifically to the contour of the piece, or of<br>
the window pane, respectively, while the membrane would<br>
be universally useable as a support for several shapes<br>
of pieces. The forming face in this case may be fixed<br>
to the membrane, for example by bonding using<br>
detachable adhesives, Velcro strips or the like in the<br><br>
desired position, supported for example by jigs. The<br>
membrane may thus form the wall of a bearing<br>
compartment or the like, which can be supplied with<br>
fluid under pressure. The window pane is positioned on<br>
the membrane or on the mold part or parts respectively,<br>
and immobilized. In particular, it is prevented from<br>
escaping by appropriate mating rests. Next, the<br>
membrane is pressed against the window pane by the<br>
fluid pressure, and then the forming face of the mold<br>
part is pressed appropriately against the piece applied<br>
to the membrane, or against the edge of the latter,<br>
respectively.<br>
The mold part itself, or its forming face, may be made<br>
of any appropriate material. It goes without saying<br>
that no degradation of the surface of the piece that is<br>
touched may occur as a result of the contact between<br>
the forming face and the piece. By way of a mold part<br>
use may be made of a semi-hard flexible rest, for<br>
example one made of PTFE (Teflon) or spring steel. In<br>
particular, mold parts made of plastic may be<br>
strengthened and stiffened using layers of fabric (for<br>
example liber glass) or metal (aluminum, steel).<br>
In theory, it is true that the position in which the<br>
piece is provided with the profiled bead is of little<br>
importance. However, it will advantageously be<br>
positioned in such a way that the profiled bead is<br>
directed more or less horizontally while it is being<br>
produced, so as to prevent the as-yet unsolidified<br>
plastic from running in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the profiled bead. The forming face may then be applied<br>
from above, from below and/or from the side to the<br>
narrow edge face of the piece, or of the window pane,<br>
respectively.<br>
In most, cases, it is appropriate to provide a mating<br>
mold, which represents the other wall of the forming<br>
cavity that is to be produced, opposite the forming<br><br>
face which defines the cross section of the profiled<br>
bead.<br>
The fluid, which may be a gas, fpr example air in the<br>
simplest scenario, or alternatively a practically<br>
incompressible hydraulic fluid, is sent into the hollow<br>
space of the support preferably using a dual pressure<br>
pump which can quickly suck the fluid out again once<br>
the profiled bead has been formed and solidified, so as<br>
to empty the support and break the contact between the<br>
forming face and the window pane and the profiled bead<br>
(so as to "demold" the profiled bead).<br>
With the method according to the invention and with<br>
appropriate devices it is possible to equip pieces of<br>
all kinds made of various materials (glass, ceramic,<br>
plastic, metal) with a profiled bead, these pieces<br>
furthermore not being merely flat but also window panes<br>
with tolerances of curvature wider than is currently<br>
the case (crinkling at the edge in a direction normal<br>
and parallel to their surface). Discrepancies regarding<br>
the so-called "end tangent" angle in curved window<br>
panes - that is to say the angle formed by a tangent to<br>
the edge of the window pane with respect to the assumed<br>
plane of the window pane - are fully compensated for,<br>
something which can be achieved only to a limited<br>
extent with rigid forming faces used in the prior art.<br>
Likewise, the window panes are no longer in contact<br>
with a hard lower mold which means that any damage to<br>
the smooth surfaces of the piece is avoided.<br>
In the case of vehicle window panes it is possible to<br>
extrude or to inject profiled cross sections with a<br>
spacing part facing away from the side of the bodywork<br>
and a scaling lip possibly extending over the edge of<br>
the window pane, flush with the lateral face without<br>
having the slight setback from the lateral face that<br>
has hitherto been necessary, the lateral face of the<br>
glass remaining entirely visible.<br><br>
Again in the case of vehicle window panes, it is<br>
possible to produce profiled cross sections which cover<br>
a space between the. narrow edge face (lateral face) of<br>
the window pane and the bodywork panel, in such a way<br>
that a smooth, discontinuity-free transition is created<br>
between the face of the window pane and the portion of<br>
profiled section to which it connects.<br>
Likewise, the visible exterior face of the lip that<br>
covers the slot may be curved in a simple way<br>
predetermined by the forming face.<br>
Finally, the visible exterior face of the profiled bead<br>
no longer has any flash as is caused in the known<br>
methods by rims on the forming face of the tool.<br>
The visible exterior face of the profiled bead may<br>
exhibit. any surface structures whatever, by giving the<br>
forming face the corresponding structure in negative.<br>
The flexible tool described is suited to fashioning<br>
profiled beads both on laminated window panes (for<br>
example on laminated safety glass) and on monolithic<br>
window panes (safety glass, particularly toughened<br>
safety glass). Thin pieces made of hard plastic may<br>
also be equipped with a profiled bead serving as a<br>
sealing lip or the like, using the method and the tools<br>
described.<br>
Other details and advantages of the subject of the<br>
invention will become apparent through the drawings of<br>
an exemplary embodiment and through the detailed<br>
description which follows. It goes without saying that<br>
profiled beads may also be fashioned using the method<br>
of the invention on pieces which are not in the form of<br>
window panes. In this instance, these may just as<br>
easily bo shaped pieces, on which a plastic sealing<br>
gasket needs to be fashioned, or compartments that need<br>
to be provided with a profiled molding, etc.<br><br>
The applications described hereinabove relate to the<br>
equipping of vehicle window panes with a profiled bead,<br>
without, any implied limitation.<br>
In the drawings, which are simplified depictions:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section of a part view of a first<br>
embodiment of a device with a forming face supplied to<br>
a support; in the form of a flexible hose, which is<br>
withdrawn from a window pane fixed in the device by<br>
relaxation of the pressure inside the support;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the same cross section as Figure 1, but<br>
this time with the forming face applied against the<br>
window pane using the support, so as to fashion a<br>
profiled bead covering the lateral face of the window<br>
pane and attaching to one of the main faces of this<br>
pane as a flush fit; and<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a second embodiment of the device,<br>
also in cross section, using which a profiled bead is<br>
fashioned on a window pane, with a lip extending freely<br>
on the lateral face of the window pane, but which does<br>
not however touch the lateral face of the window pane.<br>
According to Figure 1, a window pane 1, which here<br>
consists of a laminated window pane with two rigid<br>
individual sheets 21, 22 of glass and/or of plastic and<br>
a layer of adhesive joining these together, is placed<br>
in an overall horizontal position on an immobile rest<br>
2, simply sketched in, belonging to a processing<br>
station. This is, for example, a car windshield. A<br>
monolithic glass or plastic window pane or some other<br>
object i.n the form of a plate could just as easily be<br>
set down i.n the device. The window pane 1 is, in<br>
addition to its own self-weight, fixed on the rests by<br>
appropriate means, for example suckers, in the<br>
direction of the arrow G and is thus also held in place<br><br>
laterally. Said means may also press from above onto<br>
the face of the window pane, if collisions with other<br>
tools are excluded.<br>
We are looking at a section in the edge region of the<br>
window pane 1, with a direction of view parallel to one<br>
of the lateral intersection corners 21b, 22b, of the<br>
lateral faces 21c, 22c respectively thereof. Under the<br>
lower edge of the window pane 1 there extends an<br>
immobile rigid support frame 3. A support in the form<br>
of a flexible hose 5 is fixed to this frame via an<br>
intermediate layer 4. Fixed to the upper face thereof<br>
is a mold part 6, in the form of a strip or ribbon, the<br>
longitudinal direction of which is always parallel to<br>
the lateral intersection corner of the window pane 1.<br>
Formed on the upper face of the mold part 6 is a<br>
forming face 7, which is provided with a non-stick<br>
layer 8. The mold part 6 and its forming face 7 are<br>
flexible in the longitudinal direction. The forming<br>
face 7 extends also under the lower face of the window<br>
pane over a short width. Depicted here is a rest<br>
position of the device (also to be considered as the<br>
loading and unloading position), in which position the<br>
support in the form of a flexible hose 5 is free of<br>
pressure, or deflated. As an alternative form to that<br>
which has been depicted, the support could naturally<br>
also be wider than the mold part.<br>
A mating mold 9 is also fixed removably (such that it<br>
can pivot as necessary) on the support frame 3. This<br>
mating mold has a curved forming contour 10, of which<br>
the outer edge, distant from the window pane, bears a<br>
support shoulder 11. The inner edge of the mating mold,<br>
or respectively the outlet end of the curved contour<br>
10, slightly overhangs the edge of the window pane 1,<br>
above its upwardly facing free main face. Between the<br>
forming face 7 of the mold part 6, the curved contour<br>
10 of the mating mold 9 and the lateral face of the<br>
window pane 1 a cavity 12 is formed which acts as a<br><br>
molding cavity for producing a profiled bead having a<br>
predetermined cross-sectional shape. The forming face 7<br>
constitutes a partial wall of this cavity.<br>
As an alternative to that which has been depicted, the<br>
rests 2 and the support frame 3 may be combined. For<br>
this, it would be possible, on the edge of the support<br>
frame 3 that faces toward the window pane 1, to form a<br>
rib, either continuous or just along partial portions<br>
of the support frame, at isolated points as<br>
appropriate, with a defined height, on which the window<br>
pane 1 can be set down. At the same time, such a rib<br>
can also form a lateral rest against an exhaust of the<br>
flexible-hose support toward the window pane 1.<br>
The interior space 13 of the support in the form of a<br>
flexible hose 5 is - by way of non limiting schematic<br>
example coupled by a pipe 14 to a reversible dual<br>
pressure pump 15 operated by an electric motor and<br>
which, when run in one direction draws air from the<br>
atmosphere through a filter 16 and dispatches it into<br>
said interior space 13. When run in the other<br>
direction, the dual pressure pump 15 sucks the air back<br>
out of the interior space 13 and discharges it to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
It goes without saying that the interior space 13 may<br>
also, as an alternative to this mode of operation, be<br>
supplied from a compressed air reservoir, the pressure<br>
being established, the pressure level and the expansion<br>
being set by controlling valves.<br>
It is also possible to conceive of a hydraulic pressure<br>
variation in which use is made, by way of a fluid, of a<br>
liquid which is conveyed using appropriate devices,<br>
pumps and valves.<br>
Naturally, if need be, it is possible to provide more<br>
than one supply and exhaust station for the fluid with<br><br>
respect to the interior space 13, which stations are<br>
possibly distributed along the length of this space.<br>
Figure 2 shows the "work position", of this same device.<br>
The interior space 13 of the support 5 is now under<br>
fluid pressure. The pressure can be maintained for<br>
example by the dual pressure pump operating<br>
continuously or by closing a shut-off valve (the latter<br>
is not depicted in Figure 1). If use is being made of a<br>
hydraulic fluid, the support 5 could, by blocking the<br>
fluid, form a practically incompressible rest for the<br>
mold part 6, keeping the latter immovably on the face<br>
of the window pane even against the effect of the<br>
inject ion pressure when the profiled bead made of<br>
plastic is being injected. Under the influence of the<br>
rise in pressure in the interior space 13, the forming<br>
face 7, or, respectively, the rest faces contiguous<br>
thereto on both sides, is pressed on the one hand<br>
against the lower face of the window pane 1 and, on the<br>
other hand, against the support shoulder 11. Here, the<br>
raising movement needs only to be vertical (if the<br>
window pane and the support frame are in a roughly<br>
horizontal position) . The cavity 12 can now be seen up<br>
to a slot 17 between the mating mold and the main face<br>
21a, or the upper face of the window pane 1,<br>
respectively. The forming face 7 is applied fully,<br>
because of its flexibility in the longitudinal<br>
direct ion, on the one hand to the face of the window<br>
pane and on the other hand to the support shoulder. No<br>
slot and no open leak then remains. The mold part 6 is<br>
relatively rigid in its transverse direction, which<br>
means that it can "flex" vertically very little, if at<br>
all, when a pressure from the cavity 12 acts on it.<br>
It can also be seen that the end of the curved contour<br>
10 is nicely rounded in the direction of the support<br>
shoulder 11. Thus, it is possible to avoid flash<br>
occurring at the tip of the sealing lip that is to be<br>
produced on the profiled bead, in the transition<br><br>
between the forming face and the curved contour. A non-<br>
stick agent will also be deposited, in a way known per<br>
say, on the surface of the curved contour, so that this<br>
surface can be detached from the profiled bead once the<br>
latter has been produced.<br>
Through the slot 17 it is now possible to introduce, in<br>
a way known per se, a mass of plastic 19 into the<br>
cavity 12, using an extrusion nozzle 18 indicated only<br>
in broken line. This plastic is formed at this point<br>
into a profiled bead with the desired cross section.<br>
The nozzle is, as described, in the aforesaid document<br>
DE-C1-42 32 554, and preferably with the aid of a<br>
robot, guided along the slot for the length that has to<br>
correspond to the length of the finished profiled bead,<br>
that is to say over at least part of the periphery of<br>
the window pane or over the entire periphery of the<br>
window pane. It may, for guidance, rest against the two<br>
sides of the slot 17 on the upper main face of the<br>
window pane and on the mating mold 9. Transitions,<br>
respectively at the start and end of the profiled bead,<br>
are possibly finished off in the way known per se.<br>
As an alternative to that which has been depicted, the<br>
extrusion nozzle 18 could just as easily predetermine<br>
the cross-sectional profile of the profiled bead, at<br>
least partly in place of the curved contour 9, here<br>
fixed. It would be possible, depending on the desired<br>
transverse configuration for the profiled bead, even to<br>
entirely dispense with a mating mold or upper mold,<br>
because the extrusion nozzle itself, or the nozzle<br>
orifice, can form the theoretical contour during<br>
extrusion and because at the same time the forming face<br>
is still supported on the support shoulder or on an<br>
equivalent piece.<br>
The finished solidified profiled bead sticks at least<br>
to the edge of the upper main face of the window pane<br>
1, which has been provided in this region with a<br><br>
sticking agent, in a way known per se. In the case of<br>
monolithic window panes, the mass of plastic in this<br>
profiled cross section may also stick to the lateral<br>
face thereof. With laminated window panes, this<br>
sticking to the lateral face may be countered using<br>
appropriate means, so that the layer of adhesive can<br>
remain ventilated. These means (for example non-stick<br>
coatings, masks and the like) can be combined without<br>
difficulty with the methods described here and with the<br>
device illustrated, that are not, however, depicted<br>
here.<br>
It can be seen that the profiled bead formed is<br>
connected almost continuously to the lower main face of<br>
the window pane 1. The slightly convex forming face<br>
gives it a concave exterior contour which is highly<br>
suitable for, with this window pane 1 fitted, covering<br>
as a flush-fit a slot between the face of the window<br>
pane and the bodywork panel contiguous with the window<br>
opening (slot cover strip). The very thin lip extending<br>
freely from the outlet of this profiled cross section<br>
is supported in a stable position by the forming face 7<br>
while the plastic is being deposited and while it is<br>
solidifying.<br>
Above the upper main face 21a, the profiled bead forms<br>
a loop or, viewed in longitudinal direction, a wall,<br>
which acts as a spacer piece (spacer) in a way known<br>
per se, in order to maintain a predetermined distance<br>
between fhe interior face of the window pane and the<br>
mounting flange of the window opening, to which the<br>
window pane is bonded in a way also known per se. The<br>
customary opaque surround generally found in car<br>
windows, which visually conceals the profiled bead and<br>
the line of adhesive used for mounting and which<br>
protects them against UV radiation, has not been<br>
depicted here.<br><br>
In this configuration of the device and of the profiled<br>
bead, the mold part 6 can be made of a single piece in<br>
the form of a frame without a connection - each time<br>
for a given window pane contour - and be combined with<br>
a piece support in the form of a flexible hose or of a<br>
membrane. Naturally, a mold part made in a single piece<br>
may also be combined with several support portions,<br>
which may preferably be operated synchronously using<br>
the fluid. Even when the window pane does not need to<br>
be equipped with a profiled bead except over part of<br>
its periphery, it is nonetheless possible for this to<br>
use a complete mold part, because the length of the<br>
profiled bead is determined by the travel of the<br>
extrusion nozzle, not by the mold part. Naturally, the<br>
mold part may also be manufactured individually for the<br>
respective length of the profiled bead.<br>
According to another alternative form of the device,<br>
which is now illustrated in its work position in Figure<br>
3, the method according to the invention is used to<br>
produce a pure "profiled section with spacing lip" with<br>
no slot overlap. The profiled bead thus designed sticks<br>
only to the main face 21a of the window pane 1 situated<br>
facing a support 5'. Here again, a lip is fashioned<br>
that extends freely over the perimeter of the window<br>
pane. The latter is, however, in the case of "vehicle<br>
bodywork" mounting, in the depth of the slot between<br>
the lateral face (now free) of the window pane and the<br>
face of the bodywork.<br>
Unlike in the configuration according to Figures 1 and<br>
2, the mold part 6' here is applied to the lateral<br>
intersection corner, or to the lateral face of the<br>
window pane 1. That requires certain changes by<br>
comparison with the arrangement described before.<br>
Particularly in the case of laminated window panes, the<br>
side, or the exterior periphery of the rigid window<br>
pane 21 subsequently placed on the inside, is usually<br>
set. back slightly, as illustrated here, from the window<br><br>
pane 22 subsequently placed on the outside. Given that<br>
the profiled bead needs to stick to the main face 21a<br>
situated on the inside, the mold part 6' is brought up<br>
at an angle from the bottom to the lateral face 21c of<br>
the window pane concerned (in this instance the upper<br>
pane) (the space above the window pane needs to be<br>
clear for other tools, particularly for the robot arm<br>
that guides the extrusion nozzle). On the one hand,<br>
this is taken into consideration by a corresponding<br>
design of the deformation of the support in the form of<br>
a flexible hose 5' as it is pressurized. This can be<br>
seen visually in the form of a double-handed arrow<br>
drawn in the interior space 13 of the support 5'. The<br>
advance of the mold part therefore has also, in<br>
addition to a vertical component - as in Figures 1 and<br>
2 already - a radial horizontal component toward the<br>
inside in the direction of the lateral face of the<br>
window pane. The oblique position of the direction of<br>
advance of the mold part 6' is here depicted in an<br>
exaggerated fashion for clarity.<br>
Furthermore, the configuration of the mold part 6'<br>
itself is tailored to this application. Beside a<br>
forming lace 7' modified in accordance with the<br>
application, it also comprises a lateral resting face<br>
7' which can be applied as smoothly and with as good a<br>
seal as possible, against the lateral face of the<br>
window pane 1. Unlike the mold part 6 in Figures 1 and<br>
2, the mold part 6' should be able to conform<br>
elastically, even in the transverse direction, to any<br>
ripple or curvature in the lateral face of the window<br>
pane 1. Ripples at this point are, however, extremely<br>
small in size as a general rule because the<br>
intersection corners of the window pane are ground<br>
using an automatic machine after breakage. The mold<br>
part 6' itself may advantageously be made relatively<br>
rigid in the transverse direction and equipped with a<br>
thin elastic layer (not depicted) on just the resting<br>
face 7" , which is sufficiently elastically deformable<br><br>
against the lateral face of the window pane under the<br>
pressure of the support to guarantee the desired<br>
conformation. Naturally, this elastic rest must not<br>
stick to the plastic of the profiled bead either.<br>
In the work position, the mold part 6' presses on the<br>
one hand again against the support shoulder 11 of the<br>
mating mold 9, and, on the other hand, with a not<br>
insignificant force, against the lateral face 21c of<br>
the window pane 1. At the same time, the support 5'<br>
itself may also press lightly against the lateral face<br>
22c of the rigid lower window pane. The lateral resting<br>
face 7' of the mold part 6' is preferably configured<br>
in such a way (concave) that in the work position it<br>
mates with the lateral face of the window pane 1 -<br>
ground with a rounded portion (convex shape) in cross<br>
section - or with its rigid upper window pane<br>
respectively. Thus, the force of adhesion of the<br>
support in the vertical direction is enhanced during<br>
the filling of the mass of plastic 19 into the cavity<br>
12. Finally, a rest 2' is also provided in the form of<br>
a plastic block or a plastic molding supporting the<br>
lower face of the window pane 1 by being placed, in the<br>
way already mentioned, on the inner edge of the support<br>
frame 3.<br>
With this design of the mold part 6', the profiled bead<br>
may, in a particularly advantageous way, be placed<br>
practically immediately on the intersection 21b between<br>
the upper main face 21a and the lateral face 21c of the<br>
window pane. With conventional extrusion methods it is<br>
necessary to keep a slight setback at this point.<br>
Naturally, it is also possible, for another appropriate<br>
configuration of the mold part, to deposit the profiled<br>
bead with a greater or lesser width partly on the<br>
lateral face 21c of the rigid upper window pane 21, or<br>
also of the protruding part of the internal surface (on<br>
the same side as the adhesive material) 22a of the<br><br>
rigid lower window pane 22. The material of the<br>
profiled bead is then bounded by the intersection 22b<br>
between the internal main face 22a of the lower window<br>
pane 22 and the lateral face 22c of the lower window<br>
pane 22.<br>
All the intermediate steps that fall between the<br>
"extremes" illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, are<br>
possible, especially with monolithic window panes. It<br>
is, for example, possible also to press the mold part<br>
against the lower side of the rigid lower window pane<br>
and at the same time to partly cover the lateral face<br>
pressed against it using a modified resting face of the<br>
mold part.<br>
The other auxiliary conditions for this configuration<br>
correspond to those of the embodiment according to<br>
Figures 1 and 2, which means that there is no need to<br>
return to them in any detail here.<br>
If the profiled bead is to be laid down without<br>
interruption around one or more corners of the window<br>
pane 1 using this kind of device, the corner regions of<br>
the mold part 6' then incur certain additional costs.<br>
The mold part 6' could be split into several individual<br>
portions, for example one for each side of the window<br>
pane, and these portions could be placed one against<br>
the other only in the work position, whereas they could<br>
be parted from one another in the rest position because<br>
of the diagonal lifting movement. Then, it would<br>
nonetheless be necessary to take steps to ensure as<br>
continuous as possible a deposition of these portions<br>
(for example nesting elements such as tooth sets,<br>
slides, etc). Each portion may then be operated for<br>
example by its own support controlled by a fluid.<br>
Considering that the diagonal movement is, however,<br>
here depicted in an exaggerated fashion, the mold part<br>
may also in practice, in this embodiment, be made as a<br><br>
single piece. In the corner regions, elastic portions<br>
can be fashioned continuously in the longitudinal<br>
direction and these can, on the one hand, be applied<br>
without discontinuity to the window pane in the corners<br>
thereof and, on the other hand, can be deformed enough<br>
when in the parted rest position that they do not<br>
impede the complete separation of the mold part and of<br>
the window pane. This "demolding" can be enhanced for<br>
example by here again combining with each portion of<br>
the one-piece mold part, a fluid-controlled support,<br>
this plurality of supports being forcibly operated,<br>
also in the return direction (for example by causing a<br>
reduced pressure using a dual pressure pump), and thus<br>
enhancing the separation movement.<br><br>
