METHOD AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE ROTATIONAL POSITION<br>
OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control of a hybrid powertrain<br>
system, and more specifically to a control system to determine a rotational<br>
position of an internal combustion engine therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Vehicle propulsion systems comprising hybrid powertrains are<br>
known for managing the input and output torques of various torque-generative<br>
devices, most commonly internal combustion engines and electric machines.<br>
One hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
torque from a torque-generative source, e.g. an internal combustion engine,<br>
and an output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to a<br>
vehicle driveline. The internal combustion engine and first and second electric<br>
machines and the electro-mechanical transmission are selectively operative to<br>
transmit torque therebetween. The first and second electric machines are<br>
mechanically coupled to the internal combustion engine via an input shaft.<br>
[0003] During operation of the hybrid powertrain, the internal combustion<br>
engine can be selectively deactivated, including incidences whereat the engine<br>
is unfueled and the engine crankshaft does not rotate. Rotational angle of the<br>
crankshaft is important when the engine is subsequently restarted, in part to<br>
accurately predict torque variations caused by cylinder compression during<br>
engine cranking prior to firing the engine. This is important because<br>
magnitude of variations in engine crankshaft torque and cylinder compression<br>
can be greatest during a first rotation of the engine.<br>
[0004] Control systems for electric machines typically include a feedback<br>
device such as a position sensor, e.g., a resolver, to provide data to measure<br>
position and rotational velocity. On an electric machine comprising a three-<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
phase multi-pole synchronous electric machine, precise and accurate<br>
measurement of position of a rotor relative to each of the poles of a stator is<br>
important to achieve efficient transmission of electrical energy. Rotor position<br>
is typically measured using the resolver. Position of the resolver relative to<br>
the machine rotor is subject to error due to factors including manufacturing<br>
variations and tolerances. Correction of the resolver position error relative to<br>
the machine rotor is correctable, and a method for accomplishing this is<br>
disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
11/743901 (Attorney Docket No. GP-308283) entitled "Method and apparatus<br>
to Determine Rotational Position of an Electrical Machine", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0005] When using permanent-magnet synchronous machines, absolute<br>
position within one pole pair pitch is required. Also, the accuracy of this<br>
position measurement is critical, as it can affect the performance of the motor<br>
control, most noticeably in torque production and linearity. Using a resolver<br>
can provide precise position measurement. However, the accuracy of the<br>
measurement is directly affected by the initial alignment of the resolver during<br>
installation. The installation of the resolver and mechanical alignment can be<br>
difficult to control in production, and is typically addressed by employing a<br>
self-aligning start-up algorithm in the motor control. Furthermore, alignment<br>
of the resolver relative to the crankshaft of the attached internal combustion<br>
engine can be affected by initial installation of various components and by<br>
twisting occurring during operation.<br>
[0006] There is a need to provide an improved method and system to<br>
precisely and accurately determine rotational angle of an engine crankshaft for<br>
use by a hybrid powertrain control system, to facilitate effective engine restart<br>
and for other reasons.<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a control system<br>
for a hybrid powertrain which determines engine crank angle position based<br>
upon signal inputs from electric machines of the powertrain. The hybrid<br>
powertrain comprises an internal combustion engine and electric machines and<br>
an electro-mechanical transmission selectively operative to transmit torque<br>
therebetween. The electric machines are rotatably fixedly coupled to the<br>
internal combustion engine via a transmission input shaft and a gear set.<br>
Control modules are adapted to execute a control scheme to determine engine<br>
crank angle position. The control scheme comprises code to determine an<br>
input shaft angle based upon rotational positions of the electric machines. An<br>
offset angle of the input shaft and an angular twist between the engine and the<br>
transmission are determined. An engine crank angle offset is determined<br>
based upon the offset angle and the angular twist of the input shaft.<br>
[0008] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, embodiment of which is described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0010] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present invention; and,<br>
[0011] Figs. 2 and 3 are schematic diagrams of an exemplary control<br>
architecture and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention.<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1, 2, and 3 depict a schematic diagram of a hybrid powertrain<br>
system comprising an engine 14, an electro-mechanical transmission 10,<br>
control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Mechanical aspects of exemplary<br>
transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical<br>
Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios", which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmission embodying the concepts of the present invention is<br>
depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated generally by the numeral 10. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12 characterized by an input rotational<br>
speed, N1 and rotation angle , and is preferably driven by the internal<br>
combustion engine 14. The engine 14 has a crankshaft operatively connected<br>
to a lockable torque damper device 20 operative to transmit torque to the<br>
transmission input shaft 12. The lockable torque damper device 20 preferably<br>
includes a selectively actuable clutch C5 to lock the torque damper device 20,<br>
thus transmitting torque directly between the engine and the input shaft 12 of<br>
the transmission. The engine crankshaft rotation is characterized by speed,<br>
rotation angle E and an output torque. Engine crankshaft rotation is typically<br>
monitored by a crankshaft position sensor 11 comprising a variable reluctance<br>
sensor or similar device. When the damper device 20 is locked, the engine<br>
speed and output torque are effectively equal to the transmission input speed<br>
and input torque, with any differences comprising twisting of the components.<br>
[0013] The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a torque output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by which the engine 14 is<br>
connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the input member 12<br>
is constantly coupled to electric machines MA 56 and MB 72 by way of shafts<br>
and mechanical gears of the transmission 10.<br>
[0014] The transmission 10 employs three single planetary gear sets 24, 26<br>
and 28, and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3<br>
73, and C4 75, with the input shaft 12 connected to the first planetary gear set<br>
24 via carrier 80. An electro-hydraulic control system, preferably controlled<br>
by transmission control module ('TCM') 17, actuates and deactivates the<br>
clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated<br>
rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 and C3 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-actuated stationary devices grounded to the transmission case<br>
68. The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (MA, MB) comprise<br>
motor/generator devices which are operatively connected to the transmission<br>
via the planetary gears. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably connected to<br>
a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive output torque to vehicle wheels.<br>
[0015] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-generative<br>
devices, including the engine 14 and the MA 56 and MB 72, as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to a<br>
transmission power inverter module ('TPIM') 19 via DC transfer conductors<br>
27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system described hereinafter<br>
with regard to Fig. 2.<br>
[0016] Electric machines MA 56 and MB 72 preferably comprise known<br>
permanent magnet synchronous motor/generator three-phase AC machines,<br>
each constructed of a multi-pole electric stator and a rotor device. Such<br>
machines are preferable for powertrain and vehicle applications because they<br>
exhibit high torque-to-inertia ratios, high efficiency, and high power density.<br>
Each machine has a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that is mounted on<br>
a case of the transmission. The motor stator for each machine is grounded to<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
outer transmission housing 68, and includes a stator core with coiled electrical<br>
windings extending therefrom. The rotor for MA 56 is attached to output shaft<br>
60 and rotates therewith. The rotor for MB 72 is attached to sleeve shaft hub<br>
66.<br>
[0017] Each of the machines 56, 72 includes a position sensing device,<br>
preferably comprising a resolver assembly 82, 84 to provide accurate and<br>
precise information regarding position of the machine rotor relative to the<br>
machine stator. Each motor resolver assembly 82, 84 is appropriately<br>
positioned and assembled on one of the electric machines. The resolver<br>
assemblies comprise known variable reluctance devices including the resolver<br>
stator operably connected to the machine stator, and a resolver rotor operably<br>
connected to the machine rotor. The resolver stator comprises a series of<br>
inductive coils, or poles, assembled thereon which receive an electrical<br>
excitation signal from a motor control processor (MCPA or MCPB), and a pair<br>
of sensing, or pickup, coils which provide an electrical signal output. The<br>
resolver rotor comprises a device having a plurality of lobes, or eccentricities,<br>
located on the outer circumference. In operation, the resolver rotor rotates<br>
with the motor rotor. The pickup coils are excited by the excitation signal and<br>
return a signal to the motor control processor at the same frequency as the<br>
excitation frequency and having a voltage level that is dependent upon the<br>
proximity of the lobed resolver rotor to the resolver stator. The resolvers 82,<br>
84 operate by sensing relative position and motion of the resolver rotor<br>
rotating within the resolver stator. The control system interprets the signal<br>
returned through the resolver stator to determine rotor position, as is described<br>
herein. The variable reluctance device is one of several known technologies<br>
useable to determine position. The exemplary resolver assemblies 82, 84 for<br>
MA and MB measure electrical rotational angles A and B that range from 0-<br>
360° of electrical rotation for each pair of poles of the stators. In the system<br>
described, a 10-pole resolver system measures 360° of electrical rotation for<br>
each 72° of mechanical shaft rotation, which translates to five electrical<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
degrees of rotation for each mechanical degree of rotation. Each resolver<br>
generates an excitation frequency and measures feedback from electric signals<br>
across the resolver, permitting each resolver to measure position substantially<br>
immediately from start of rotation, without a need to synchronize.<br>
[0018] In a typical engine system using a 58X crank wheel and a variable<br>
reluctance sensor, there are six degrees of mechanical rotation for each<br>
discernible sensor signal output. Thus, in this embodiment each resolver has a<br>
measurement resolution thirty times greater than the crank sensing system.<br>
The engine system can be expected to rotate as much as one complete<br>
revolution to synchronize the sensor output to an engine top-dead-center<br>
('TDC') location for a nominal first cylinder. Thus, resolution of angular<br>
rotation using a resolver device can provide substantially improved crank<br>
angle resolution, which can be effectively used during engine restart events.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, schematic block diagrams of the<br>
control system, comprising a control architecture that is distributed amongst a<br>
plurality of modules, is shown. The elements described hereinafter comprise a<br>
subset of overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system<br>
control of the powertrain system described herein. The control system<br>
synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms to<br>
control various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters<br>
as fuel economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of<br>
hardware. The exemplary architecture for the control system comprises an<br>
arrangement of devices and modules, and emphasizes communications links<br>
between the control devices and various components of the powertrain system<br>
and the vehicle system. The control system for the powertrain system<br>
preferably comprises the following control devices: engine control module<br>
('ECM') 23, and a transmission control module ('TCM') 17. There are motor<br>
control modules 33, 22 for MA and MB ('MCPA', 'MCPB'). A hybrid<br>
control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of<br>
the aforementioned control modules. The TPIM 19 preferably comprises a<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
single control module device including the HCP 5, MCPA 33, and MCPB 22.<br>
Vehicle communications bus 106 provides a first communications link<br>
between ECM 23, HCP 5, MCPA 33, MCPB 22, TCM 17, as well as to<br>
vehicle 1. Hybrid communications bus 107 provides a second<br>
communications link between ECM 23, HCP 5, MCPA 33, and MCPB 22.<br>
The vehicle communications bus 106 of this embodiment comprises a first<br>
controller area network (CAN1) and the hybrid communications bus 107<br>
comprises a second controller area network (CAN2).<br>
[0020] The exemplary system includes direct electrical signal connection<br>
between various elements of the powertrain system and specific control<br>
devices to facilitate communication of information outside normal channels<br>
afforded by the vehicle bus 106 and the hybrid bus 107, preferably at a faster<br>
update rate. This facilitates improved system control. The ECM 23 is directly<br>
connected to the engine 14 via the plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. One of those lines is distinctly shown apart from<br>
aggregate line 35, comprising a wire cable that is a signal line 45 from the<br>
engine crankshaft position sensor 11. The signal line 45 from engine crank<br>
position sensor 11 is directly wired in parallel to the one of the control<br>
modules of TPIM 19, to provide direct signal information from crank position<br>
sensor 11 for improved system control. The ECM 23 is preferably further<br>
directly connected to the vehicle 1 via aggregate line 201 in order to<br>
communicate vehicle-related inputs including coolant temperature, coolant<br>
level, and a hood switch, and to effect control of one or more coolant flow<br>
pumps. The HCP is preferably further directly connected to the transmission<br>
10 via aggregate line 205 to have redundant inputs from a gear selector<br>
(PRNDL) sensor.<br>
[0021] The control module device of TPIM 19 preferably comprises a single<br>
integrated circuit which includes the processor devices for the HCP, MCPA,<br>
and MCPB. There is a first serial peripheral interface bus ('SPI') 110 between<br>
HCP and MCPA, and a second SPI bus 110 between MCPA and MCPB. Each<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
SPI bus comprises a full-duplex synchronous serial data link permitting direct<br>
communication between the devices. The MCPA directly and individually<br>
communicates with the HCP and the MCPB via the first and second SPI buses<br>
110, thus achieving high-speed communications between the devices without<br>
communications delays which occur via the vehicle bus 106 or the hybrid bus<br>
107. In this embodiment, messages are typically sent from the HCP to the<br>
MCPA and MCPB over the vehicle bus 106 and the hybrid bus 107 each 6.25<br>
millisecond loop. Furthermore, messages are sent between the HCP and<br>
MCPA and MCPB via the SPI buses. In the embodiment, there is a serial<br>
control interface (SCI) (not shown) which effects communication between the<br>
MCPA and the MCPB.<br>
[0022] The typical SPI-bus comprises a 4-wire serial communications<br>
interface to provide a synchronous serial data link which supports a<br>
low/medium bandwidth (e.g., 1 megabaud) network connection amongst the<br>
control modules supporting the SPI. A synchronous clock shifts serial data<br>
into and out of microcontrollers of the control modules in blocks of 8 bits.<br>
The SPI bus is a master/slave interface, with the master driving a serial clock,<br>
and data being simultaneously transmitted and received in a full-duplexed<br>
protocol. In this application, the master comprises the HCP 5. Further<br>
specific details of SPI communications are known to a skilled practitioner and<br>
not discussed in detail herein.<br>
[0023] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators of the<br>
engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as aggregate line<br>
35. Various inputs that are monitored by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine crankshaft speed, manifold pressure, ambient air<br>
temperature, and ambient pressure. Various actuators that are controlled by the<br>
ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command signals to the<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
transmission. The TCM 17 is preferably directly connected to the<br>
transmission 10 via a plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as<br>
aggregate line 41.<br>
[0024] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), i.e., non-volatile memory, high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D)<br>
and digital to analog (D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices<br>
(I/O) and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control<br>
module has a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program<br>
instructions and calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the<br>
respective functions of each computer. Algorithms for control and state<br>
estimation in each of the control modules are typically executed during preset<br>
loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle.<br>
Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of<br>
the central processing units and are operable to monitor inputs from the<br>
sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to control<br>
operation of the respective device, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
typically executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25<br>
and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle operation.<br>
Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to occurrence of an<br>
event.<br>
[0025] The invention comprises a control scheme to determine engine crank<br>
angle during ongoing operation, an embodiment of which can be executed for<br>
operation in a powertrain system constructed in accordance with the above<br>
description. The exemplary powertrain includes the internal combustion<br>
engine, the electric machines, and the electro-mechanical transmission<br>
selectively operative to transmit torque therebetween. The electric machines<br>
are rotationally fixedly coupled to the internal combustion engine via the input<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
shaft. Control modules are adapted to execute the control scheme to<br>
determine an engine rotational angle (E) based upon inputs from the electric<br>
machines during vehicle and engine operation, which is correlated to engine<br>
crankshaft position and a piston position, typically a TDC position of the<br>
nominal first cylinder. The control scheme preferably includes machine-<br>
executable algorithmic code and inter-control module communications. The<br>
algorithmic code is operational during engine cranking, starting and ongoing<br>
vehicle operation, typically including any time the vehicle is in a key-on<br>
mode. Engine angle data is stored in non-volatile memory of one of the<br>
control modules during engine-off and vehicle-off periods.<br>
[0026] In operation, rotational positions of the first and second electric<br>
machines are determined based upon signal inputs from the resolvers typically<br>
measured in electric degrees of rotation. Rotational position, or angle, of the<br>
input shaft 12 is determined based upon the rotational positions of the first and<br>
second electric machines, i.e., A and B. An offset of the input shaft angle<br>
(E) is determined based upon the angle of the input shaft 12, comprising a<br>
combination of A and B. A form of the offset is stored in EPROM or other<br>
non-volatile memory for use during operation of the vehicle, including during<br>
ongoing vehicle operation and during vehicle shutdown events. An angular<br>
twist, T, occurring between the engine and the electric motors of the<br>
transmission is determined, comprising twisting of the input shaft 12 and the<br>
torque damper device 20. The angular twist, the input shaft angle and the<br>
offset of the input shaft angle are combined to provide a measure of the engine<br>
rotational angle E. This measure of the engine rotational angle E can be<br>
determined the first time the control system executes the control scheme<br>
during an engine restart or engine start event, typically within 300<br>
microseconds of an engine start event. This is now described in greater detail.<br>
[0027] The current engine rotation angle CURR is determined by adding the<br>
offset E, to the engine rotational angle E, as shown in Eq. 1:<br>
E, CURR = E + E;	[1]<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
[0028] wherein the engine rotation angle E comprises the most recently<br>
determined engine angle based upon a signal input from the crank sensor<br>
which is a hardwired input to the MCPA 33, as shown in Fig. 3. The engine<br>
rotational angle E may have been determined at any time during operation,<br>
including an engine-off event and a vehicle shutdown event.<br>
[0029] The offset angle E is determined by combining the angular twist,<br>
T, of the input shaft 12 and  which represents the change in rotational<br>
position of the input shaft, determined based upon angular positions of the<br>
electric machines, as shown in Eq. 2:<br>
E = T + ,	[2]<br>
wherein  is determined in Eq. 3:<br>
, =A * K1+ B* K2.	[3]<br>
[0030] The factors Kl and K2 comprise multipliers determined based upon<br>
mechanical gear ratios of the planetary gears of the transmission device and<br>
the quantity of lobes of the resolvers. At appropriate points in execution of the<br>
above calculations, the electrical rotational angles A, B are translated to<br>
engine crank mechanical angles based upon the resolver design.<br>
[0031] The input shaft angle, , is determined as shown in Eq. 4:<br>
 = (A * Kl) + Cl + (B* K2) + C2.	[4]<br>
[0032] A value C3 can be determined, using results of Eq. 4, as described in<br>
Eq. 5:<br>
C3 = C1+C2;	[5]<br>
[0033] The value C3 represents the angular offset between input shaft angle<br>
as measured by the resolvers, and the engine crank angle, and can be<br>
represented as described in Eq. 6:<br>
C3 = E - T - 	[6]<br>
[0034] The value C3 is ongoingly determined during engine operation and<br>
saved to non-volatile memory for use during subsequent engine crank/start and<br>
restart events. The engine rotation angle E is ongoingly measured by the<br>
crank sensor, and can be captured in the non-volatile memory for subsequent<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
use upon engine shutdown at a point wherein engine crankshaft rotation stops.<br>
Therefore, at any time during operation of the vehicle and engine, the current<br>
engine rotation angle ,CURR can be determined by Eq. 7:<br>
E = C3 + T + ;	[7]<br>
[0035] as derived and calculated from engine twist and rotation of the<br>
electric machines MA and MB. This includes periods during which the engine<br>
is shutdown during ongoing vehicle operation, and after vehicle operation has<br>
been discontinued.<br>
[0036] The design and layout of the control system, especially TPIM 19,<br>
provides operation of the system. The SPI buses 110 provide time-<br>
synchronized communications between the HCP and motor control modules<br>
MCPA and MCPB. The SCI interface effects communications between motor<br>
control modules MCPA and MCPB, including using SPI communications<br>
from the HCP to synchronize time and time stamps. Control module MPCB 22<br>
measures input from resolver B 84 to determine B, which it communicates to<br>
MCPA 33, including a precise, synchronized time-stamp. The MPCA 33<br>
measures input from resolver A 82 to determine A and monitors the 58X<br>
signal input from the direct-wired crankshaft sensor 45 from which engine<br>
angle E is derived. The MCPA compensates and corrects the time-stamp for<br>
B based upon any communications delays. This includes adjustments for<br>
rotational speed and time delays in communication to the HCP 5, to<br>
accommodate latencies introduced by delays in measurement and<br>
communications. The time-corrected measurements for A, B, and the 58X<br>
signal input from the direct-wired crankshaft sensor 45 are communicated to<br>
the HCP 5, which executes the control scheme to determine engine rotational<br>
angle (E) based upon inputs from the electric machines. The measurements of<br>
A and B are converted from electrical degrees to mechanical degrees of<br>
crankshaft rotation. The high-speed communications between the devices<br>
using the SPI buses serves to minimize measurement errors which occur in<br><br>
GP-308341-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
systems that rely only upon LAN communications systems between control<br>
modules.<br>
[0037] The angular twist T of the input shaft can be estimated based upon<br>
mechanical factors of the shaft and the engine and transmission and the spring<br>
rate of the torque damper device 20. Magnitude of the angular twist T is<br>
preferably an application-specific precalibrated relationship between engine<br>
operating factors including the engine rotational speed and the input torque T,<br>
transmitted between the transmission and the engine.<br>
[0038] The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
