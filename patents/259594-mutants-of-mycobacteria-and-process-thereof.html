				<td>MUTANTS OF MYCOBACTERIA AND PROCESS THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides an attenuated mutant Mycobacterium strain wherein the mutant strain is incapable of expressing the active tyrosine phosphatase and is impaired in its ability to survive in activated macrophages and animals. The invention also provides a method for developing a mutant Mycobacterium strain with modified tyrosine phosphatase gene in its genome. The invention also provides a method to assess the role of tyrosine phosphatase in virulence and pathogenesis of mycobacteria and identifies these as potential targets for developing new anti-tubercular drugs. Background of the invention:<br>
One-third of world's population is infected with M. tuberculosis asymptomatically. Eight million new cases of active diseases develop each year &amp; three million people succumb to this disease every year (Dye et al., 1999). With the advent of HIV &amp; emergence of multidrug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, the problem has increased manifold (Horsburgh, 1991; Barnes et al., 1991 and Bloch et al., 1994). The current treatment of disease usually involves combination chemotherapy based on isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin &amp; ethambutol. In general, 6 months long course is required for effective treatment, which often results in poor compliance on the part of patients, who stop drug intake as soon as they begin to feel better. This leads to development of drug resistant forms of bacilli, which are able to survive routine drug therapy. Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as a disease due to tubercle bacilli resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-tubercular drugs. Such a precarious scenario demands development of new drugs that can act on new targets and can be effective in relatively shorter periods so that the patients do not develop resistance to these drugs. The present invention can lead to the development of such target specific anti-tubercular drugs useful for short-term therapies.<br>
Sequence analysis of various prokaryotes has shown the presence of eukaryotic like serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases in bacterial pathogens. In various pathogenic bacteria like Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic E.colityrosine phosphatases have been shown to act as major virulence determinants (Guan and Dixon., 1990; Galyov et al., 1993 and Kaniga et al., 1996)<br>
YopH, one of the PTPases, is encoded by the yersiniae virulence plasmid and has been identified as an essential virulence factor (Bliska ef al., 1991). YopH comprises of several domains including amino terminal sequences involved in secretion, translocation and chaperone binding; a central proline rich SH3 - binding domain and a carboxyl terminal catalytic domain that is homologous to a domain in the eukaryotic PTPases (Sory ef al., 1995). It is postulated that YopH disrupts a general phagocytic mechanism as both Fc receptor and complement mediated phagocytosis is inhibited by YopH. (Ruckdeschel ef al., 1996 and Fallman et al., 1995). Two of the YopH substrates, p130cas and paxillin are proteins involved in connecting integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and the third one is a tyrosine kinase (Persson et al., 1997 and Black et al., 1997). The possible explanation for the role of YopH protein is that it inhibits uptake of bacteria mediated by the interaction of the bacterial outer membrane protein invasin with cellular pi integrin. According to this model, invasin binding stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular targets, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements and bacterial uptake. YopH dephosphorylates the protein required for this activity. Recent studies have shown that YopH also inhibits Akt pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase dependent secretion of interleukin 2 in macrophages (Sauvonnetefa/., 2002).<br>
S. typhimurium encodes a tyrosine phosphatase, SptP comprised of modular domains. The amino-terminus of SptP exhibits sequence homology to the Exotoxin S from P. aeruginosa and YopE from Yersinia spp.. Exotoxin S is an ADP ribosyl transferase that has been implicated in P. aeruginosa in the induction of host cell injury and is known to be a virulence factor of P. aeruginosa. The carboxyl terminus of SptP showed homology to the eukaryotic like protein tyrosine phosphatases. The carboxyl terminus of SptP protein is homologous to YopH and the catalytic domain of the eukaryotic PTPase. The cysteine residue at position 481 is essential for its catalytic activity as mutation of this conserved cysteine residue abolishes the phosphatase activity (Kaniga ef al., 1996). Kaniga ef al showed that sptP mutants are defective in the colonization of spleens of orally infected BALB/c mice. SptP has been shown to possess an in vitro GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards two host GTP binding proteins, Rac-1 and Cdc42 that play an important role in the cytoskeletal dynamics (Fu and Galan, 1999). It has been suggested that the GAP activity of SptP could down regulate signaling through Cdc42 and Rac that could rebuild the actin cytoskeleton after Salmonella entry. Fu and Galan have shown that microinjection of<br>
purified GST-SptP into cultured cells results in the disruption of actin cytoskeleton and the disappearance of stress fibers (Fu and Galan, 1999). Prior art:<br>
Allelic exchange by homologous recombination is a powerful tool to study gene functions, identification of virulence factors and development of auxotrophic mutants. "Gene knockout" technique involves the replacement of a wild type gene with it's nonfunctional counterpart. Such targeted mutations are widely used to study gene functions in mammalian, eukaryotic and bacterial cells (Guilhot ef a/., 1992; Myers ef a/., 1994; Reyrat ef a/., 1995; Baulard ef a/., 1996; Balsubramaninan ef a/., 1996;; Azad ef a/., 1996 ; Azad ef a/., 1997; Hinds ef a/., 1999; parish ef a/., 1999;; Pelicic ef a/., 1997; Bardarov etal., 1997 and Raynaud etal., 2002).<br>
Sequence analysis of M. tuberculosis genome revealed the presence of 11 serine/threonine kinases and two tyrosine phosphatases (Cole ef a/., 1998). Both genes having sequence homology with known tyrosine phosphatases were PCR amplified by using gene specific primers and M. tuberculosis genomic DNA, cloned in a prokaryotic expression vector, pGEX5x-3 and purified from E. coli as GST fusion proteins (Koul ef a/., 2000). The GST fusion proteins were able to dephosphorylate the phospho-tyrosine residue of myelin basic protein but were unable to dephosphorylate phospho-serine and phospho-threonine residues of myelin basic protein. Site directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues in the catalytic motif (Cys11 in the case of MptpA and Cys160 in the case of MptpB) abolished the enzymatic activity (Koul ef a/., 2000). By Southern blot analysis, it was revealed that mptpA is present in fast growing as well as slow growing species of mycobacteria. However, while the mptpB was present in slow growers it was found to be absent in M. smegmatis, a fast growing species. (Koul ef a/., 2000).

The invention provides a method, wherein in the second antibiotic marker gene imparting resistance to kanamycin is inserted in the recombinant vector backbone.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is to modify tyrosine phosphatase gene in the genome of Mycobacterium using either recombinant vector pAKAA or pBKAB.<br>
The present invention further provides a method wherein homologous recombination may be used to replace the active tyrosine phosphatase gene of mycobacteria by a double cross over event with a modified gene to develop a mutant Mycobacterium strain.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is to assess the role of MptpA and MptpB in the virulence and pathogenesis of mycobacteria in activated macrophages and animals.<br>
Further the invention shows that the mutant Mycobacterium strains are attenuated and impaired in their ability to survive in activated macrophages and animals.<br>
Further the invention relates to two tyrosine phosphatases MptpA and MptpB of   mycobacteria which are potential targets for developing anti-tubercular drugs. (A)      Construction of recombinant vector, pAKAA.<br>
The mutant strain lacking tyrosine phosphatases associated with either MptpA was employed to understand the role of these proteins in the survival of M. tuberculosis in murine macrophages and in the ability of the mutants to cause disease in guinea pigs.<br>
The wild type tyrosine phosphatase gene was modified to develop a mutant strain of Mycobacterium. The genome of Mycobacterium encodes for two tyrosine phosphatase, MptpA and MptpB. The genomic DNA from mycobacterium strain was extracted by CTAB standard methods as given in Example 3. The gene for mptpA was amplified from the genome using specific primers as shown in Table 1 and also given in Example 4.<br>
Based on the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis, the primers were designed to amplify mptpA (SEQ ID NO: 11) along with its upstream and downstream flanking regions. A DNA fragment carrying 1135 bp upstream to the mptpA ORF along with the initial 156 bp of mptpA ORF was PCR amplified by using M. tuberculosis DNA as template and primer A (SEQ ID NO: 1) and primer B (SEQ ID NO: 2) carrying a Nde I site at the 5'end. The amplicon was end-repaired and cloned into EcoR V digested vector pl_itmus-38 resulting in vector pLitAI. The ligation was transformed into E. coli as given in Example 5. The plasmids were isolated from the recombinants as given in Example 6. The recombinants were analysed by restriction enzyme digestion as given in Example 7.<br>
Another DNA fragment carrying 167 bp of mptpA ORF corresponding to the C-terminal region of MptpA along with 1240 bp downstream to the mptpA ORF was PCR amplified by using gene specific primers, primer C (SEQ ID NO: 3) carrying a Nde I site at the 5' end and primer D (SEQ ID NO: 4) carrying a BspH I site at the 5'end. The amplicon was end-repaired and separately cloned into EcoR V digested vector pLitmus-38 resulting in vector pLitA2. The vector pLitAI was digested with Nde I and Sea I and the larger DNA fragment containing the initial 156 bp of mptpA ORF along with 1135 bp upstream to the mptpA ORF was gel purified by standard procedure as given in Example 8 and 9. Similarly, vector pLitA2 was digested with Nde I and Sea I and the smaller DNA fragment containing the 167 bp of mptpA ORF corresponding to the C-terminal region of MptpA along with 1240 bp downstream to the mptpA ORF was gel purified. The larger fragment obtained by the digestion of pLitAI and the smaller fragment obtained by the digestion of pLitA2 were then ligated together resulting in pLitAA. The mptpA specific primers primer B (SEQ ID NO: 2) and primer C (SEQ ID NO: 4) were non-overlapping; as a result, the vector pLitAA contained the coding region of mptpA with a deletion of 112 bp from the central region of ORF. The vector pLitAA comprises nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 13. The insert sequence in the vector was characterized by sequencing as shown in Example 11.<br>
The vector also carried 1135 bp of upstream and 1240 bp of downstream flanking sequences and a unique Nde I site in the ORF of mptpA at the deletion site for the cloning of hygromycin resistance gene. The hygromycin resistance gene was excised out from pLit28res-hyg-res as a BamH I - Xba I fragment, end-repaired and cloned into Nde I digested, end-repaired pLitAA resulting in pLitAAH. The insert sequence in the vector was characterized by sequencing as shown in Example 11. The vector pLitAAH comprises an insert having nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15.<br>
A 4.8kb DNA fragment containing mptpAA :: hygrwas excised out from pLitAAH as a Spe \-Nhe I fragment and cloned into Xba I -digested pJQ200SK (a non-replicative suicide vector) yielding pJQAA. A second antibiotic resistance marker for kanamycin resistance was inserted in the vector backbone as given below.<br>
The gene conferring resistance to kanamycin was excised out from pSD5 as an<br>
Nhe I - BstE II fragment, end repaired and cloned into Sma I digested pJQAA resulting<br>
in pAKAA. The recombinant vector pAKAA provided 1.3 kb and 1.4 kb homologous<br>
region on either side of the hygromycin resistant gene for recombination to occur at<br>
mptpA locus between targeting DNA and the mycobacterial genome.<br>
The recombinant vector pAKAA comprises the modified mptpA gene (SEQ ID NO 15) and a second antibiotic resistance marker in the backbone. (B)      Construction of recombinant vector pBKAB.<br>
For disruption of mptpB of M. tuberculosis, vector pBKAB was constructed. The genomic DNA from mycobacterium strain was extracted by CTAB standard methods as given in Example 3. The gene for mptpB (SEQ ID NO : 12) was amplified from the genome using specific primers as shown in Table 1 and also given in Example 4.<br>
Based on the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis, the primers were designed to amplify mptpB (SEQ ID NO: 12) along with its upstream and downstream flanking regions. For this, a DNA fragment containing 1045 bp upstream to the ORF of mptpB along with the initial 356 bp of ORF of mptpB was PCR amplified using M. tuberculosis DNA as template and primers E (SEQ ID NO: 5) and primer F (SEQ ID NO: 6). The amplicon was end-repaired and cloned into Eco R V digested vector pLitmus-38 resulting in vector pLitBI. The ligation was transformed into E. coli as given in Example 5. The plasmids were isolated from the recombinants as given in Example 6. The recombinants were analysed by restriction enzyme digestion as given in Example 7.<br>
Another DNA fragment containing 367 bp of mptpB ORF corresponding to the C-terminal region of MptpB along with 1140 bp downstream to the ORF of mptpB was PCR amplified using gene specific primers primer G (SEQ ID NO: 7) and primer H (SEQ ID NO : 8). The amplicon was end-repaired and separately cloned into EcoR V digested vector pLitmus-38 resulting in vector pLitB2. The vector pLitBI was digested with Nde I and Sca I and the larger DNA fragment containing the initial 356 bp of mptpB ORF along with 1045 bp upstream to the ORF was gel purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. Similarly, pLitB2 was digested with Nde I and Sca I and the smaller DNA fragment containing the 367 bp of mptpB ORF corresponding to the C-terminal region of MptpB along with 1140 bp downstream to the ORF was gel purified. The larger fragment obtained by the digestion of pLitBI and the smaller fragment obtained by the digestion of pLitB2 were then ligated together resulting into pLitAB. The mptpB specific primers primer F (SEQ ID NO : 6) and primer G ( SEQ ID NO : 7) were non-overlapping, as a result, the vector pLitAB contained the coding region of mptpB (with a deletion of 108 bp from the central region of ORF) and 1045 bp of upstream and 1140 bp of downstream flanking sequences and a unique Nde I site in the ORF of mptpB at the deletion site for the cloning of hygromycin resistance gene cassette. The<br>
vector pLitAB comprises nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO : 14. The insert sequence in the vector was characterized by sequencing as shown in Example 11.<br>
The hygromycin resistance gene cassette was excised out from pLit28res-hyg-res as a BamH I - Xba I fragment, end-repaired and cloned into A/ate I digested, end-repaired pLitAB resulting in pLitABH. The insert sequence in the vector was characterized by sequencing as shown in Example 11. The vector pLitABH comprised the insert having nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO : 16.<br>
A 4.9 kb DNA fragment containing mptpAB::hygr was excised out from pLitABH as a Spe \-Nhe I fragment and cloned into Xba I -digested pJQ200SK (a non-replicative suicide vector, Pelicic et al., 1996) yielding pJQAB. A second antibiotic resistance marker for kanamycin resistance was inserted in the vector backbone as given below.<br>
The gene conferring resistance to kanamycin was excised out from pSD5 as an Nhe \-BstE II fragment, end repaired and cloned into Sma l-digested pJQAB resulting in pBKAB. The vector pBKAB provided 1.4 kb and 1.5 kb homologous regions upstream and downstream of the hygromycin resistant gene, respectively, for recombination to occur between targeting DNA and the mycobacterial genome.<br>
The recombinant vector pBKAB comprises the modified mptpB gene (SEQ ID NO: 16) and as second resistance marker in the backbone.<br>
(C)       Modification of the mptpA in the genome of Mycobacterium and its role in the virulence and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis.<br>
In order to evaluate the role of MptpA in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, an mptpA mutant strain was constructed by using a non-replicative vector pAKAA having modified mptpA sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO : 15. The recombinant vector, pAKAA carried the coding region of mptpA along with it's 1135 bp upstream and 1240 bp downstream flanking sequences of mptpA. A portion of the coding region (112 bp) of MptpA was deleted and replaced with gene conferring resistance to hygromycin in pAKAA. Electroporation of M. tuberculosis Erdman with non-replicative vector, pAKAA and alkali denatured pAKAA resulted in 39 and 2 hygromycin resistant transformants, respectively on 7H10 plates supplemented with hygromycin (50|ig/ml). The details are of electroporation are given in Example 12. The alkali pretreatment is as given in Example 13. All the transformants were PCR positive for hygromycin resistance gene suggesting that plasmid borne mptpAA::hyr had integrated into the<br>
mycobacterial genome. Allelic exchange by homologous recombination should result in incorporation of the hygromycin resistance gene but not the vector backbone (carrying kanamycin resistance gene) into the mycobacterial genome. Thus, the transformants were screened for kanamycin resistance gene by PCR using gene specific primers. The transformants obtained upon electroporation of pAKAA were PCR positive for the kanamycin cassette, where as the two transformants obtained upon electroporation of alkali denatured pAKAA were PCR-negative for the kanamycin cassette. These results indicated that homologous recombination at mptpA locus had occurred in the case of transformants obtained upon electroporation of alkali denatured DNA. Thus, transformants resistant to hygromycin but sensitive to kanamycin were selected to score for homologous recombination event.<br>
The disruption of mptpA in the mycobacterial genome was verified by Southern blot analysis using mptpA specific DNA probe (SEQ ID NO : 11). The details of the southern blot hybridization and preparation of nucleic acid probes are given in Example 14 and 15). As expected, for allelic exchange event to occur at homologous site, in the lanes corresponding to the two hygr kans transformants, a single hybridizing fragment 4.1 kb, 2kb longer than that in the wild type strain (2.1kb) was observed. This increase in the size of the band by 2.0 kb in both hygrkans transformants corresponded to the replacement of 112bp internal fragment of mptpA with hygromycin resistance gene (Fig 1A). Immunoblot analysis (as given in Example 10) of whole cell lysate demonstrated that disruption of mptpA resulted in lack of expression of MptpA in the mutant strain (Fig. 1B).<br>
To investigate the role of MptpA in the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis, the survival rates of mptpA mutant and its parental strain were compared in resting as well as in IFN-y activated mouse macrophage cell line, J774A.1. The numbers of intracellular surviving bacteria were calculated at days 0,2,4,6 and 8 post-infection. Both parental as well as mptpA mutant strain displayed a similar pattern of intracellular growth in resting macrophages. While at the initial time point (dayO) bacillary counts were approximately 2 x 104 per well. The bacillary load increased at later time points attaining peak values of 2 x 105 at day 8 post-infection. These results showed that both parental as well as mptpA mutant strains of M. tuberculosis exhibited comparable capacity of infection and multiplication in resting macrophages (Fig. 2A). However, both the strains differed in their ability to survive in IFN-y activated macrophages. In activated macrophages approximately 45%, 50% and 70% killing of wild type bacilli was observed, at days 2,4 and 6 post-infection, respectively, in comparison to 70%,<br>
95% and 98% killing of mptpA mutant strain at days 2, 4 and 6 post-infection, respectively (Fig. 2B). These observations indicated that disruption of mptpA had impaired the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in IFN-y activated macrophages. The details of in vitro studies in macrophages are shown in Example 16.<br>
To determine whether MptpA plays a role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, guinea pigs in groups of 16 animals were infected subcutaneously with 5 x 107cfu of parental, mutant or complemented strain of M. tuberculosis. Animals were euthanised 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-infection. At both time points of euthanisation (7 animals per group), number of colony forming units in spleen and lungs were enumerated (represented as log10cfu for each group).<br>
The mptpA mutant strain was significantly attenuated for growth in guinea pig model of tuberculosis. At 3 weeks post-infection a 9-fold reduction was observed in the bacillary load in spleens of animals infected with mptpA mutant strain (log10 5.09 + 0.23) as compared to the parental strain (log 105.99 + .27, Fig. 3A). A similar reduction in cfu was also observed in the lungs of animals infected with mptpA mutant strain, (log10 3.07 + .13) as compared to (log10 3.95 + 0.32) in the lungs of animals infected with the parental strain (Fig. 4A). The differences in the bacterial load in the spleen and lungs of animals infected with mptpA mutant strain as compared to the bacterial load of animals infected with parental strain increased from 9 folds to 90 folds at six weeks post-infection. The bacillary load in the animals infected with mptpA mutant strain was log10 4.83 + 0.43 for spleens and 3.71+ 0.30 for lungs, when compared to the bacillary load in animals infected with parental strain 6.73 + 0.33 for spleens and 5.62 + 0.38 for lungs (Fig. 3B and 4B, respectively). The reduction in the bacillary load in the spleens and lungs of animals infected with mptpA mutant strain was found to be statistically significant (p
Sections of liver and lung from various groups were analysed histologically to determine the extent of tissue damage. Fig. 5 depicts the mean percentage of granuloma and cellular composition in liver granuloma of animals at 3 weeks postinfection. At 3 weeks post-infection, the animals infected with the parental strain exhibited 5.4% liver granuloma. The liver granuloma comprised of 10% lymphocytes, 8% macrophages and 82% epitheloid cells. In case of animals infected with the mptpA mutant strain, 10% liver granuloma was observed and the granuloma comprised of 21% lymphocytes, 11% macrophages and 68% epitheloid cells (Fig. 5).<br><br>
In case of lung, no significant difference was observed in the percentage of granulomatous tissue and cellular composition of the granuloma in case of animals infected with various strains. The animals infected with parental strain exhibited 14% lung granuloma and lung granuloma comprised of 30% lymphocytes and 70% macrophages. In case of animals infected with mptpA mutant strain 21.5% lung granuloma was observed and the granuloma comprised of 30% lymphocytes and 70% macrophages. Representative sections of liver and lung of animals infected with the parental or mptpA mutant strain at 3 weeks post-infection are shown in Fig. 6. The details of guinea pig studies is shown in Example 17. (D)       Modification of the mptpB in M.  tuberculosis and  its effect on the<br>
pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis:<br>
In order to establish whether MptpB plays a role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, a mptpB mutant strain of M. tuberculosis was constructed by using a non-replicative suicidal vector pBKAB having a modified mptpB sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 16. The targeting vector, pBKAB carried the coding region of mptpB along with 1045 bp upstream and 1140 bp downstream flanking sequences. A portion of the coding region (108 bp) of MptpB was deleted and replaced with the gene conferring resistance to hygromycin in pBKAB. The vector also carried the gene conferring resistance to kanamycin in its backbone as a second antibiotic selection marker for negative screening of allelic exchange events at the homologous site.<br>
Electroporation of M. tuberculosis with pBKAB and U.V. irradiated pBKAB resulted in 22 and 3 hygromycin resistant transformants, respectively. The details of electroporation are given in Example 12. The U.V. irradiation is as given in Example 13. PCR analysis revealed that all the transformants contained hygromycin cassette indicating that these colonies were not spontaneous resistance mutants and arose from integration of the suicidal vector into the mycobacterial genome. Allelic exchange event by homologous recombination should result in the incorporation of hygromycin resistance gene but not the vector backbone (having kanamycin resistance gene) into the mycobacterial genome. Thus, transformants resistant to hygromycin but sensitive to kanamycin were selected to screen for homologous recombination event. All the transformants obtained on electroporation of untreated DNA were kanamycin resistant while the three transformants obtained on electroporation of U.V. pretreated DNA were sensitive to  kanamycin.  This suggested  that an  allelic exchange  event at the<br>
homologous site had taken place in the case of these three hygr kans transformants obtained upon electroporation of U.V. irradiated DNA.<br>
mptpB gene disruption was assessed by hybridization analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the parental M. tuberculosis strain and three hygRkans transformants. A DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of mptpB (SEQ ID NO : 12) was used as probe as given in Example 15. Southern blot analysis (as given in Example 14) showed presence of a 1.85 kb band in the parental strain whereas a 3.8 kb band was observed in all the three hygRkans transformants as expected upon replacement of 108 bp internal fragment of mptpB with hygromycin resistance gene cassette (Fig. 7A). These results indicated that mptpB was disrupted in all the three hygRkans transformants. Expression of MptpB was analysed in the mutant strains using polyclonal sera raised against MptpB in rabbit. Western blot analysis (as shown in Example 10) showed absence of MptpB expression in all the three mutant strains (Fig. 7B). The complemented strain was constructed by electroporation of pSD5-mptpB into electrocompetent cells of the mutant strain. The electroporation of pSD5-mptpB restored the expression of MptpB in the complemented strain (Fig. 7B).<br>
To study the effect of disruption of mptpB gene on the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis, resting and IFN-y activated murine macrophage cells were infected with either the wild type or mptpB mutant strain of M. tuberculosis. The number of surviving intracellular bacteria was determined on days 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 post - infection. Both parental as well as the mptpB mutant strain displayed a similar pattern of intracellular growth at all time points of study (Fig. 8A). While at the initial time point (day 0) the bacillary counts were approximately 104 cfu/well, the bacillary load increased at later time points attaining the peak values of ~ 105 cfu at 8 days post -infection. These results showed that both parental as well as the mptpB mutant strain exhibited comparable capacity of infection and multiplication in resting mouse macrophages. However, the two strains showed differences in their ability to survive in the activated macrophages. The number of wild type M. tuberculosis and mptpB mutant was maximum and comparable at the initial time point (-104 cfu/well, at day 0). At later time points, a reduction in the number of bacilli was observed in both cases. While the wild type M. tuberculosis was reduced to 50% and 28.6% at days 4 and 6 post- infection, respectively, a much sharper decline was noted in the case of mptpB mutant which was reduced to 10% and 4% at days 4 and 6 post - infection, respectively (Fig. 8B).   These observations indicated that disruption of mptpB gene<br>
had impaired the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in IFN-y activated macrophages. The details of in vitro studies in macrophages are shown in Example 16.<br>
To determine whether the disruption of mptpB gene would have any effect on the survival of M. tuberculosis in vivo, guinea pigs in groups of eight animals were infected subcutaneously with 5x105 cfu of either parental, mutant or the complemented strain of M. tuberculosis. Animals were euthanized three weeks and six weeks postinfection. At both time points of euthanization, spleens were homogenized and viable bacilli were enumerated (represented as log10 cfu for each group).<br>
It was observed that at 3 weeks post-infection, the mean total score of the animals infected with mutant strain was 26, which was comparable to the scores in case of animals infected with parental (28) and complemented strain (30, Fig.9A). These results were commensurate with the splenic cfu obtained for various groups on euthanization of animals at 3 weeks post-infection. The bacterial load in the spleen of animals infected with the mutant strain was log10 3.71, which was comparable to the bacterial load in the spleens of animals infected with parental (log™ 3.73) and complemented strain (log10 3.68, Fig.lOA). However, the total scores of the animals infected with mutant strain at the end of six weeks was significantly lower (12) than the total score of animals infected with parental (35, p
Sections of liver and lung from animals in various groups were subjected to histological analysis to determine morphology of the organs, the presence and extent of granuloma and the type and number of infiltrating cells. It was observed that at three weeks there were no significant histological differences in liver and lung of animals infected with either parental, or mutant or complemented strain. At 3 weeks postinfection animals from all 3 groups showed no difference in the extent or composition of granuloma. In case of liver, granuloma consisted mainly of epitheloid cells and lymphocytes, while the lung granuloma comprised mainly of lymphocytes macrophages and a few epitheloid cells (Fig. 11A and 11B). At six weeks post -<br>
infection, in the case of animals infected with wild type and complemented strain, the liver sections showed multiple well-defined granuloma comprising of epitheloid cells and lymphocytes. However, the liver tissue from animals infected with the mptpB mutant strain exhibited a distinct qualitative difference with respect to the presence of epitheloid cells with only a few lymphocytes. In case of lung tissues, the animals infected with the wild type and complemented strain showed extensive granulomas comprising of lymphocytes and macrophages. In contrast, the lung tissue from animals infected with the mutant strain showed partly organized granuloma mainly of lymphocytes (Fig. 12A and 12B). The details of guinea pig studies is shown in Example 17. Statistical analysis<br>
Data are depicted as arithmetic mean + standard error mean. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student's t test. Differences between the guinea pig groups were considered significant if p values were

The cells were harvested by pelleting the culture at 6,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold trituration buffer (1/20th of the original culture volume) and diluted to the original culture volume by using prechilled tituration buffer.

The clarified cell lysate was prepared by subjecting the crude cell lysate to centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. The DNA was precipitated by adding 600 µl of ammonia mix solution and recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature. The pellet was washed twice with chilled 70% ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in 50 µl of TE buffer. (iii)      By Qiagen miniprep kit:<br>
The bacterial culture was grown and harvested as described above. The pellet was resuspended in 250 ul of buffer P1 and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. After incubating for 5 minutes, 250 ul of buffer P2 was added and mixed by gentle inversions. After incubating for 5 minutes, 350 ul of buffer N3 was added and incubated on ice for 5 minutes and the clarified cell lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant was passed through the Qia column, followed by washing with 500 ul of buffer PB. The column was<br>
then washed twice with 750 y\ of buffer PE. The purified DNA was eluted in 100 JLXI of<br>
elution buffer.<br>
Maxi preparation of DNA:<br>
Plasmid DNA was isolated on a large scale by the alkaline SDS method (Sambrook et al 1989). A single colony was inoculated in 200 ml of 2XYT medium containing appropriate antibiotic(s) and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of Solution I containing lysozyme (to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml). The sample was incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubating on ice for 30 minutes, 8 ml of freshly prepared Solution II was added and the sample was further incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Then, 6 ml of Solution III was added and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The clarified cell lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The DNA was precipitated from the cell lysate by addition of 10.8 ml of isopropanol (0.6v/v). After incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes, plasmid DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. The pellet was washed twice with chilled 70% ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in 750 µl of TE buffer. The DNA was incubated with RNAaseA (20 (µg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C, followed by extraction with phenol chloroform. DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated by addition of 2.5 volumes of chilled absolute ethanol and sodium acetate to a final concentration of 0.3M. The DNA was incubated at -70°C for 15 minutes, and DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in 100 µl of TE buffer. Example 7: DNA manipulations for Cloning Purposes: Restriction Digestion of DNA:<br>
The restriction enzyme digestions of DNA were carried out at the specified temperature, as per manufacturer's recommendations. The analytical digestion was carried out in a reaction volume of 20 µl and preparative digestions were carried out in a reaction volume of 100µI. Dephosphorylation of DNA termini:<br>
Removal of 5' phosphate groups from DNA fragments was carried out by using Calf intestinal phosphatase. The DNA was incubated with the enzyme (1U) in 1X buffer at 37°C for 30 minutes followed by incubation at 56°C for 30 minutes. The enzyme was inactivated by incubating the reaction mixture at 65°C for 10 minutes<br>
followed by phenol chloroform extraction and DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 10 (al of autoclaved double distilled water. End filling of 5' overhang of DNA fragment:<br>
DNA fragment with 5' overhang was end repaired by using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase-l. The DNA (50ngµl) was incubated with the enzyme (1-2U per µg of DNA) in 1X buffer containing 200 µM of dNTPs and incubated at 25°C for 15 minutes, followed by heat inactivation at 75°C for 15 minutes. Ligation of DNA termini:<br>
All the ligation reactions were carried out in a volume of 10 µl at 25°C for 3-4 hours. Each reaction contained typically 100 ng of the digested vector DNA, insert DNA fragment at 1:3 and 1:5 (vector: insert) molar concentrations and 1x ligase buffer containing 1mM ATP and 40U of T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixtures were then used to transform competent cells of £ coli XL1-Blue and transformants were selected on appropriate LB agar supplemented with appropriate antibiotic(s). Example 8: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:<br>
Agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out essentially as described earlier (Sambrook et a/., 1989). DNA fragments of size &gt; 500 bp were resolved on 0.8% agarose gel, while those in the range of 250 - 500 bp were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel. The gels were electrophoresed in 1X TAE buffer containing 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide. Example 9: Elution of DNA from Agarose:<br>
DNA was eluted from agarose gel by using the Qiagen gel extraction kit. The gel was excised out and incubated with 3 gel volumes of QG buffer, at 55°C till the agarose was melted. The samples were then passed through Qia column, column was washed twice with PE buffer and the DNA was eluted in 50 µl of elution buffer. Example 10 : Immunoblot analysis:<br>
Protein samples were resolved on 10% SDS - PAGE and then transferred to Hybond C extra membrane overnight at 40mA or at 180mA for 2hours by using the Bio-Rad mini Trans Blot Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Transfer of the protein to the membrane was confirmed by staining with Ponceau S stain. The membrane was blocked in 2% milk for 2 hours at room temperature. The blot was than incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of the polyclonal sera for 2 hours at room temperature. To prevent non-specific binding of antibody, the dilutions were prepared in 2% milk-PBST. The blot was then washed thrice with PBST. After washing, the blot was<br>
incubated with peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit Immunoglobulin-G at a dilution of 1:2500. After incubation for 1 hour, the blot was washed thrice with PBST and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by the addition of PBS containing 10 |il/ml of 30% H202 and 0.5 mg/ml 3,3' diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Example11: DNA sequencing<br>
The DNA samples for sequencing were prepared from 3ml culture of the respective transformants using the Qiagen prep spin plasmid kit. The DNA samples were sequenced by using an ABI Prism 377 sequencer with rhodamine dye terminator chemistry.<br>
The sequencing PCR reaction was set up in a PE-2400 thermocycler (Perkin Elmer - Cetus, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA) by using 500 ng double stranded DNA and 3.2 pmol vector specific oligonucleotides. After completion of the sequencing reactions, the extension products were precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol to remove un-incorporated terminators. The samples were than loaded onto a 4% long ranger gel. The sample lanes were analysed on a DNA sequencing analysis 3.0 software (ABI-Prism, Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Example 12: Electroporation of M. tuberculosis:<br>
M. tuberculosis cultures were grown to Aeoonm of 0.8 with shaking at 200 rpm at 37°C. Before harvesting, the cells were chilled on ice for one hour. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes, washed twice with chilled glycerol (10%), resuspended in 1 ml of chilled glycerol (10%) and stored in aliquots of 100 |il each at -70°C, till further use.<br>
For electroporation, approximately 2 µg of DNA was mixed with 20 µl of cells, kept on ice for 15 minutes and cells were subsequently pulsed at field strength of 16 kV/cm (400 V input, 330µF capacitance, 8kOhms resistance, 2.4 kV output using cuvette with 0.15 cm gap width). Cells were recovered in 1ml of 7H9 medium at 37°C, 200 rpm for 24 hours. The transformants were selected on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates supplemented with ADC and containing appropriate antibiotic(s). Plates were incubated for 14-21 days at 37°C. Example13: Alkali and U.V. pretreatment of DNA:<br>
The targeting DNA was pretreated with alkali before its electroporation into the competent cells of M. tuberculosis as per the method described by Hinds et al 1999 (Hinds et al., 1999). The vector was denatured in 20 µl of 0.2M NaOH containing 0.2 mM EDTA for 30 minutes at 37°C. The denatured DNA was precipitated by addition of 1/10th volume of 3M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of chilled absolute ethanol. The<br>
DNA was precipitated by incubating the samples at -70°C for 15 minutes and recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15minutes at 4°C. The pellet was washed twice with chilled 70% ethanol to remove salts, air dried and resuspended in 10 nl of double distilled water. For U.V. pretreatment, DNA was subjected to U.V. irradiation in an U.V. stratalinker 1800 (Amersham) at 100-mJ cm"2 for 5 minutes. For alkali and U.V. pretreatment of DNA, the DNA was prepared by Qiagen column as described above. Example 14: Southern Blot hybridization:<br>
The genomic DNA was isolated from M. tuberculosis, and subjected to restriction digestion by appropriate restriction endonuclease. The digested fragments were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel at low voltage (40V) overnight in 1X TAE gel running buffer. The DNA fragments were depurinated by soaking the gel in 0.1 N HCI for 10 minutes followed by a wash with double distilled water. The DNA was then denatured by soaking the gel in denaturation buffer (1.5M NaCI, 0.5 M NaOH). The gel was then rinsed with double distilled water and neutralized in neutralization buffer (1M Tris pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCI). The DNA was then transferred to Hybond N membrane by capillary transfer in 20X SSC overnight (Southern 1975). The membrane was air-dried and DNA was cross-linked to the Hybond N membrane by U.V. irradiation for 2 minutes at 700mJ. The blot was prehybridized in a solution containing 50% deionised formamide, 5X SSC, 5X Denhardts solution, 50mM Tris-CI, pH7.5 and 200µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA overnight at 42°C. The heat denatured probe was then added to the blots and hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 14-16 hours. The blot was washed first in 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 minutes and then in 0.2X SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 minutes and then in 0.2X SSC and 0.2% SDS at 65°C for 30 minutes. The blot was then air dried, wrapped in saran wrap and subjected to autoradiography. Example 15: Preparation of Nucleic Acid Probes:<br>
The DNA fragment to be labeled was PCR amplified by using gene specific primers. The amplicon was purified by using Qiagen gel extraction kit and end-labeled by using NEBIot kit in a 50µl reaction. The labeling reaction comprised of 100ng of template DNA, 1x klenow buffer (having random primers), 1mM dGTP, 1mM dCTP, 1mM dTTP and 10uCi of a32P dATP, 1U of klenow fragment. The template DNA was denatured at 100°C for 5 minutes and kept in ice for 2 minutes, dNTPs and enzyme were added and end labeling was carried out at 37°C for 2hours. Unincorporated<br>
dNTPs were removed by using Qiagen nucleotide removal kit and the labeled probe was added to the blot.<br>
Example 16: In vitro infection of mouse macrophage cell line by M. tuberculosis:<br>
J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line (resting or activated with rIFN-y 50Uml"1 for 16hours) was seeded in a six well plate at a density of 2x105 per well. Before infection, the cell lines were washed once with 1 x Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and medium was replaced with Dulbeccos modified eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). The bacterial strains were washed twice with DMEM and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. The cells were infected with wild type or mutant strain at an MOI of 1:10 (macrophage : bacteria). The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% C02 atmosphere. After 6 hours of infection, cells were washed twice with 1x HBSS and overlayed with 2 ml DMEM supplemented with FCS (10%), Antibiotic-antimycotic (1%) and amikacin (20 µg/ml). On days 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8, infected cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. The number of bacilli at different time points was determined by plating 10-fold serial dilutions in duplicates on MB 7H10 medium and incubating the plates at 37°C for 3 weeks. Example 17: Virulence studies in guinea pigs:<br>
The effect of disruption of tyrosine phosphatases on the virulence of M. tuberculosis was evaluated in the guinea pig model of experimental tuberculosis. This work was carried at Tuberculosis Research centre, Chennai. Random-Bred guinea pigs of the Duncan-Hartley strain in the weight range of 200 - 400g were obtained from National Center for Laboratory Animal Science (NCLAS), Hyderabad.<br>
The guinea pigs were divided into groups of sixteen each. Each group comprised of 16 animals, 8 males and 8 females. The different groups of guinea pigs were challenged with one of the organisms mentioned below subcutaneously and 8 animals (4 males and 4 females) were euthanised at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post -challenge.<br>
High Dose (5x107)<br>
a)	M. tuberculosis Erdman<br>
b)	mptpA mutant strain<br>
Low Dose (5x105)<br>
c)	M. tuberculosis Erdman<br>
d)	mptpB mutant strain<br>
e) mptpB complemented strain<br>
All the organisms were coded and animals were subcutaneously challenged with all the coded preparations separately by using a 1ml tuberculin syringe with a 26 G needle.<br>
After euthanasia the following investigations were carried out<br>
1)	Gross body weight of the animal.<br>
2)	Weight of infected organs - liver, spleen and lung.<br>
3)	Scores of the gross pathological damage to the organs (Post-mortem scores).<br>
4)	Viable   count   of   the   tubercle   bacilli   from   spleen   and   lung   (Bacterial enumeration).<br>
5)	Histopathological evaluation of liver and lung.<br>
The gross body weight of the animals was measured at the time of beginning of the experiment, and at weekly intervals till euthanasia. Liver, lungs, spleens and lymph nodes were removed aseptically and the weight of the infected organs was measured. The bacterial load was enumerated in spleens and lungs. Portions of liver and lung tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological analysis of granuloma formation and cellular composition of granuloma. Post-mortem scores:<br>
The virulence was measured based on the rate of progression of the disease in guinea pig as described by Mitichison. (Mitichison, 1964). At the post-mortem examination of the animals, the total extent of tuberculosis disease was assessed as a score ranging from 0 to 100. The extent of visible lesions in the organs were scored as described in Table 5. Average score for each group was calculated. Viable count of the tubercle bacilli from the spleen and lung:<br>
The spleen and portion of lung was removed into a sterile, weighed grinding tube. Organs were homogenised in 5ml of double distilled water by using a teflon homogenizer. Ten fold serial dilutions (10-1 102 10-3,10"4) were prepared in distilled water and 10µlof neat homogenate and various dilutions were inoculated in LJ slopes in duplicates. The LJ slopes were incubated at 37°C and readings for cfu were taken after 4 weeks and 6 weeks. The number of cfu per organ and an average organ cfu for each group was calculated. The sensitivity of this detection method was 500 bacilli.<br>
Histopathology of liver and lungs:<br>
The liver and lungs of the animals were removed and stored in preweighed jars containing 10% formaldehyde. Two bits of tissue (2cm x 2cm thickness) each from liver and lung were fixed in 10% formalin until further treatment. The organ bits were washed in 70% alcohol and 95% alcohol for 2 hours each followed by treatment with isopropanol for 2 hours. In order to ensure complete dehydration of the tissue, the isopropanol treatment was repeated twice. The bits were then incubated in xylene for 15-20 minutes and finally embedded in molten paraffin wax. The paraffin embedded tissue portions was divided into 5 µl fine sections by using a microtome (Reichert, Germany) and fixed onto glass slides. Deparaffinization of the cut sections was carried out prior to staining. The slides were first immersed twice in xylene for 5 minutes each followed by treatment with isopropanol twice for 3 minutes each. The slides were finally treated with 95% alcohol for complete removal of traces of wax.<br>
The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for the presence of granuloma. The sections were washed in water and stained with hematoxylin for 5 minutes. Excess stain from the slide was removed by washing with distilled water. The slides were then counterstained with eosin solution for 1 minutes, washed with water and air-dried. For viewing the slides under the microscope, the slides were mounted using DPS mount and covered with a coverslip. The proportion of the granuloma and extent and type of cellular infiltration in the sections were microscopically assessed as described earlier (Ridley, 1977 and Jayashankar and Ramanathan, 1999). The tissue sections were analysed for following parameters to determine the effect of disruption of tyrosine phosphatases on the virulence of M. tuberculosis; size of typical granuloma; amount of caseous necrosis; relative number of neutrophils; macrophages; giant cells; epitheloid cells and lymphocytes; degree to which lymphocytes were organized in the granuloma and extent to which granuloma were organized. At least four different sections for each tissue were analyzed. Statistical analysis:<br>
Data are depicted as arithmetic mean + standard error mean. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student's t test. Differences between the various groups of guinea pig were considered significant if p values were
