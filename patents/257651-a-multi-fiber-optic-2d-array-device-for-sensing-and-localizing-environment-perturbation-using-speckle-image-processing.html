				<td>A MULTI-FIBER OPTIC 2D-ARRAY DEVICE FOR SENSING AND<br>
LOCALIZING ENVIRONMENT PERTURBATION USING SPECKLE<br>
IMAGE PROCESSING<br>
Technical Field<br>
A system for sensing perturbations in a distributed manner using an array of<br>
multimode fibres for localization (zone identification) of the perturbation.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to a two dimensional array based speckle<br>
pattern sensing system having 4X3 (12) multimode fibres for sensing perturbation in<br>
multiple zones, said multimode fibres are imaged in parallel by a charge coupled<br>
device (CCD) camera and their speckle pattern analyzed by a conventional image<br>
processing hardware to determine the perturbations.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various types of environment perturbation measurement have been attempted by<br>
researchers and that includes, but not limited to, displacement, vibration, pressure,<br>
stress, strain, temperature, intrusion, acoustic wave etc. The principle of speckle<br>
pattern and its use in sensing environment perturbation is well known. An analysis of<br>
the changes in the speckle pattern output from a multimode optical fibre could be used<br>
to obtain information about the perturbation of the fibre. In all the cases reported till<br>
now a single multimode fibre is used and a single speckle pattern analyzed for<br>
perturbation sensing. Although, the distribution sensing capability of the fibre can<br>
cover a large area of sensing, but the sensing zone remains only one. Therefore, the<br>
localization of the perturbation always remains a problem.<br>
It is well known that the output speckle-intensity distribution from a multi-mode fibre<br>
is affected by the perturbation of the fibre, and it can be used for sensing. In other<br>
words, if the fibre status changes because of an external perturbation, the output<br>
speckle pattern also changes. Even though it is difficult to predict the speckle<br>
distribution, an approximate relationship between the perturbing factor and the<br>
speckle intensity distribution may be developed for which the perturbation of the fibre<br>
may be determined.<br>
When the output from a multimode fibre is projected on a screen (e.g., a ground glass<br>
plate), a uniform circular pattern is observed. When the light is coherent, the pattern<br>
becomes very granular, consisting of a very large number of speckles of varying<br>
intensities with smooth distribution of intensity. The distribution of these speckle<br>
changes slowly over time, but the intensity of the total circular pattern remains<br>
basically constant. This pattern is very sensitive to perturbations (that include, but<br>
not limited to, displacement, vibration, pressure, stress, strain, temperature, intrusion,<br>
acoustic wave etc) on the fibre which generate the change in path of light in various<br>
modes. When the optical fibre carrying the coherent light is perturbed, the distribution<br>
of the speckle intensities is seen to change with the perturbation, with some speckles<br>
becoming brighter, some dimmer, and some not changing at all. The total intensity of<br>
the pattern remains unchanged, however. Hence it is not an intensity-modulated<br>
sensor as the total intensity is always a constant.<br>
The system in its prior form is used as follows. The multimode fibre is kept in the<br>
environment to be sensed in a distributed manner, i.e. the changes in the perturbation<br>
any where on the length of the fibre can be sensed equally without discrimination. As<br>
mentioned earlier, the fibre may sense various types of environment perturbation. A<br>
CCD camera senses the speckle pattern generated at the end of the fibre core falling<br>
on a ground glass plate. The CCD camera has an array of photosensors (charge<br>
coupled) arranged in a two dimensional array form. Each photosensing element<br>
contributes one picture element, or pixel, to the image frame. The image falling on the<br>
CCD can be captured by image acquisition hardware residing in a computer. The<br>
amplitude of the perturbation is sensed by the image processing of the speckle pattern.<br>
The typical processing requirement of an image here are differentiating the current<br>
speckle image with respect to the previous or the reference speckle image stored<br>
earlier. In this manner the amplitude of the perturbation can be measured.<br>
The above solution to perturbation sensing appears fine unless one realises that the<br>
present day standard cameras are capable of acquiring images of the order of<br>
768X574 or more in the two dimensions. At the time when the experimental studies<br>
for such speckle image processing were being developed, it was found that the<br>
information describing an image can be unacceptably large for processing of speckle<br>
patterns in real time because of non availability of such real-time processing<br>
hardware. It was then shown by (Kulchin et. al, Optical Engg, V. 36, No. 5, 1997)<br>
that television standard images contain unnecessary information about the speckle<br>
pattern formed by ordinary multimode optical fibres. The average size of the speckles<br>
can be calculated as (Svelto, 1982):<br>
Average size of the speckles = 2R(klD),<br>
where D is the diameter of the source of light (optical fibre core), R is the distance<br>
between the source and plane of registration, and X is the wavelength of the laser<br>
diode.<br>
The diameter of a light field formed by an optical fibre in the plane, placed at a<br>
distance R from its output, can be calculated as (1983, Synder &amp; Love):<br>
The diameter of light field = 2.NA.-R,<br>
where NA is the numerical aperture of optical fibre. Thus, the entire number of light<br>
and dark speckles in the speckle pattern can be calculated by:<br>
Total number of light and dark patterns = (NA2.D2)A?<br>
If formed by a standard multimode optical fibre with parameters NA=0.2 and D = 50<br>
um, and using a Laser Diode(A.=0.6328um), the number of such speckles in a circular<br>
pattern is ~ 252. The standard CCD cameras with 756X582 pixels can easily sense the<br>
perturbation affecting the speckle distribution. The latest pipelined or parallel image<br>
processing hardware allows image frame operations in real-time. This forms the basis<br>
of the development of the device, which has even wider sensing ability by way of an<br>
array of multimode fibres.<br>
Spillman et. al. (Applied Optics, V. 28, No. 15, 1989) claim the use of Statistical<br>
Mode Sensor (SMS) include, but are not limited to, intrusion detection, structural<br>
vibration sensing, and acoustic sensing. In their sensor, all the image (using 128X128<br>
array of photodiodes) processing occurs in electronics. Just before a new pixel is<br>
stored in the frame buffer, the old pixel data is removed, and both old and new pixel<br>
data are passed to an arithmetic circuit. The arithmetic circuit finds the absolute value<br>
of the differences between the old and new pixels. All the absolute values of the<br>
differences for the entire frame are then accumulated and normalised to give a single<br>
value. The single value represents the amount of change in the speckle pattern that<br>
occurs over a period of time between the captured frames.<br>

The main object of the present invention is to provide a system capable of sensing<br>
perturbation in multiple zones at the same time.<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, the multimode fibres are placed at a<br>
central spacing of 5mm to use standard connectors as well as forming a unified image<br>
consisting of 12 speckle patterns closely touching each other at an appropriate<br>
distance after diverging in space, the designed spacing is kept as 5mm so that no two<br>

on a 1/2" CCD with a working distance of 95mm from the glass plate, and with an<br>
optical reduction of 0.3 for a 1/2" CCD size camera.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the CCD camera resolution<br>
required is fairly standard with 768X574 pixels (after image acquisition) because the<br>
average size of the speckles can be calculated as 2R(A/D), where D is the diameter of<br>
the source of light (optical fibre core), and R is the distance between the source and<br>
plane of registration, the diameter of a light field is 2.NA.R, the entire number of light<br>
and dark speckles in a single pattern can be calculated as NA2.D2/ A,2, if formed by a<br>
standard multimode fibre with optical parameters NA=0.2, and Z)=50um, and using a<br>
Laser diode (A=0.6328 [mi), and the number of such speckles in a single circular<br>
pattern is approximately equal to 252.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the spatial resolution available in<br>
the system comes out to be 26um (with a FOV of 20X15mm in 768X574 resolution)<br>
while the average diameter of the individual grains comes out to be 300 jam (with<br>
5mm dia for each circular speckle pattern), which can be easily resolved with a<br>
standard CCD camera.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the image digitized at 768X574 resolution<br>
provides 12 segments of size 191X191 pixels for each speckle pattern in a square,<br>
each segment in the image is corresponding to a zone, and identification in addition to<br>
measurement of perturbation amplitude and processing of the speckle pattern for<br>
quantification of the perturbation depends upon the user application and requirement.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the standard CCD camera with the<br>
above resolution easily senses the perturbation from 12 zones simultaneously where<br>
each speckle corresponds to a zone in the field.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, three such devices can be used<br>
together with image processing systems which allow three simultaneous camera video<br>
signals digitalized, thereby increasing the number of zones by three times.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the sensing elements: the<br>
multimode fibres are arranged as minimum 4X3 form allowing 12 zones using a<br>
standard CCD camera for image acquisition.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the resolution is decided by the<br>
fibre zone length and layout.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the system allows standard CCD<br>
camera for image acquisition and allows parallel and concurrent sensing of<br>
environment from at least 12 different zones.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the system allows sensing of many<br>
different environment perturbation parameters at a time, very suitable for monitoring<br>
and controlling of various perturbation factors multiplexed using a single device.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the total field of view is 20X14mm<br>
for 4X3 multimode fibres and the resolution for each of 12 circular speckle pattern is<br>
191X191 pixels.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the number of array elements<br>
given here are 4X3=12, which can be increased by further reducing the spacing to the<br>
physical limits of the standard connectors and appropriately changing the spacing of<br>
glass plate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, more than one sensing modules<br>
can be used together for further increase of number of zones, this is possible by using<br>
typically acquiring three simultaneous video channels for three such sensing modules.<br>
Having given the principle of the speckle pattern sensing the environment<br>
perturbation, we now provide the schematic design of the system which allows<br>
multifibres to be used to add two dimensions to the distributed sensing capability of a<br>
multimode fibre. A single multimode fibre can provide a circular speckle pattern on<br>
the whole CCD image but as mentioned earlier, the whole image is not needed for<br>
accommodating a single speckle pattern. Therefore, the design given here uses a 2Darray<br>
of multimode fibres (4X3=12) whose speckle images are made to fall on a<br>
ground glass plate. A CCD camera images the required field of view of all the speckle<br>
patterns digitised to a single 768X574 pixels image. In this manner, 12 speckle<br>
patterns are formed on the CCD array sensing different multimode fibres sensing<br>
perturbation in parallel from 12 different zones. The zoning here adds another<br>
dimension in sensing perturbation (in parallel) which has independent distributed<br>
sensing capability. Each zone sensing the environmental perturbation is visible on the<br>
computer speckle image with a resolution of 191X191) pixels. This resolution, by all<br>
means in various configurations is sufficient to sense perturbation leading to changes<br>
in 12 (4X3) speckle patterns. This scheme can be easily enhanced by reducing the<br>
fibres spacing.<br>
The Source Module consists of 12 Laser Diodes (LDs) feeding 12 multimode fibres to<br>
be used as field (zone) sensors. The fibres are laid in the field in a manner as desired<br>
for the required perturbation to be sensed in different zones. The receiving ends of all<br>
the fibres terminate at the Receiver Unit using standard SMA connectors. The<br>
Receiver Unit guides the light from each of the zone fibres to a Sensing Module<br>
which consists of a Multi Fibre Adapter (MFA). This adapter has 12 holes (4X3) with<br>
hole-spacing (5mm) to accept standard ferrules of FC connectors and the light from<br>
all these is available in parallel from the other surface of the adapter. The Sensing<br>
Module also houses a ground glass plate of 2mm thickness at an appropriate distance<br>
(12.5mm) where the ground surface of the plate has the speckle patterns from all the<br>
12 multimode fibres ready for imaging. At this distance, all the patterns are of equal<br>
diameter (5mm) and are just touching each other forming a field of view of<br>
20X15mm.<br>
The speckle image falling on the circular glass plate is made to cover an image of<br>
20X15mm where 12 (4X3) speckle patterns touch each other and have a diameter of<br>
5mm each. A Lens Assembly with multi-element lenses is able to image all of them as<br>
a single unified image on to the CCD array of a standard CCD camera. The camera<br>
lens assembly requires an optical reduction factor of 0.3 with a working distance of<br>
95mm to suit a 1/2" CCD array. The CCD image when viewed on a monitor is viewed<br>
full in analog form. The output of this camera is digitized using an image processing<br>
hardware/software residing in a computer for further processing and analysis. The<br>
digitization used with approximately square pixels in the resolution of 768X574<br>
pixels provides individual speckle patterns in 191X191 square covering a circular<br>
speckle pattern for each zone. The image digitized with 768X574 resolution in the<br>
computer has all the required zones images (in 12 segments in the image) for<br>
individual or combined image processing.<br>
The camera in the system uses a microscopic lens to image the speckle patterns falling<br>
on the ground glass area covering barely the speckle array of multiple multi-mode<br>
fibres. The total Field of View FOV of the speckle image area on the ground glass<br>
plate is 20X15mm. With this setup, the spatial resolution on the object plane comes<br>
out to be 26 um (in 768X574 resolution) while the average diameter of the individual<br>
grains comes out to be =300 j^m (with 5mm per speckle pattern) which can easily be<br>
resolved in this case.<br>
As mentioned above, the camera used consists of a 1/2" CCD array which has a<br>
sensing area of 6.4mmX4.8mm, 756X582 sensing elements and each pixel size of<br>
8.6X8.3|j.m. With a microscopic lens leading to an optical reduction of 0.3, 12 speckle<br>
patterns are viewed on a computer or TV monitor. Further, with the image acquisition<br>
hardware/software, the image is digitized to an appropriate size, say 768X574<br>
providing 191X191 pixels for each speckle pattern for further processing. With each<br>
speckle pattern corresponding to each multimode fibre, it is thus possible to identify<br>
each speckle, which is perturbed, and thus localize each perturbation by analyzing all<br>
the patterns in parallel or in sequence as per the requirement. The resolution of this<br>
localization, however, is limited to the extent identifying which fibre has been<br>
perturbed.<br>
The special characteristics of the sensor and where it can be used are as follows:<br>
a) A system useful for sensing environment purturbation (that includes but not<br>
limited to displacement, vibration, pressure, stress, strain, temperature,<br>
intrusion, acoustic wave etc.) in a distributed manner and also sensing in<br>
multiple zones easily identifiable using speckle image processing.<br>
b) A system claimed herein wherein the sensing elements are multimode fibres<br>
arranged as minimum 4X3 form allowing 12 zones using a standard CCD<br>
camera for image acquisition.<br>
c) A system useful for sensing perturbation in a distributed manner using an<br>
array of multimode fibres for localization (zone identification) of the<br>
perturbation with the resolution decided by the fibre zone length and layout.<br>
d) A system allowing standard CCD camera for image acquisition and allows<br>
parallel and concurrent sensing of environment from at least 12 different<br>
zones.<br>
e) A system that allows sensing of many different environment perturbation<br>
parameters at a time, very suitable for monitoring and controlling of various<br>
perturbation factors multiplexed using a single device.<br>
f) A system with total field of view of 20X14mm for 4X3 multimode fibres.<br>
g) A system with 191X191 pixels of resolution for each of 12 circular speckle<br>
pattern.<br>
h) The number of array elements given here are 4X3=12. This can be increased<br>
by further reducing the spacing to the physical limits of the standard<br>
connectors and appropriately changing the spacing of glass plate.<br>
i) More than one sensing modules can be used together for further increase of<br>
number of zones. This is possible by using typically acquiring three<br>
simultaneous video channels for three such sensing modules.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
In the drawings following the specification,<br>
Fig. 1 shows the overall block diagram of the system.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the top view, side view and the sectioned view of the Sensing Module<br>
and its different parts.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the design of the Multi Fiber Adapter (MFA).<br>
Fig. 4 shows the image frame depicting the 12 circular speckles from the 12<br>
multimode fibres.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the examples given below which are provided<br>
by way of illustration and therefore should not be considered to limit the present<br>
invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
For experimental testing, a 2D-array of 12 multi-mode fibre array was used and<br>
plugged in the MFA. The specifications of the fibres used were: NA=0.2, 50/125|j,,<br>
tight buffered, 0.9mm. A Laser Diode (A,=0.6328um) has been used to illuminate all<br>
the twelve fibres. The image formed was projected on a ground glass. A 2D-array of<br>
4X3 multimode fibre sensor with the above specifications, a camera, computer setup<br>
along with an image processing system has been used, as shown in Figure 1. The<br>
vibration or dynamic status is sensed, using the mean absolute speckle intensity<br>
variation method, in which the speckle pattern in the initial state is subtracted from<br>
that in the current state. This sensing technique detects the mean-absolute speckleintensity<br>
variation between the updated and the reference speckle pattern thereby<br>
determining the environmental perturbation factor. The overall intensity of the<br>
subtracted pattern is then integrated, so that it may be used to deduce the external<br>
perturbation. Kun Pan et al. (Applied Optics, V. 33, No. 10, 1994) has already<br>
reported determining sub-micrometer displacement as well as temperature<br>
measurement using this approach.<br>
In the present application, a real-time image processing equipment, which has the<br>
processing power to produce the sum of absolute differences of the two frames is<br>
used. Here the two frames are the current frame and the one prior to the current one.<br>
The results showed the perturbation made in different fibres in the form of pressure<br>
applied on the individual multimode fibre sensor. In no pressure condition, the<br>
difference image showed nearly black patterns for all the cases. In case of fibre sensor<br>
under pressure, the integrated value for each speckle showed a high non-zero value<br>
indicating perturbation. The localization of the perturbed fibre is possible due to the<br>
array structure of the sensor.<br>
Example 2<br>
The proposed system can also be used in security systems for intrusion detection.<br>
While the detection of an intruder is the basic requirement of such a system, the<br>
localization of the intruder or the approximate identification of the zone is equally<br>
important.<br>
Example 3<br>
By further using more than one such sensing modules (typically 3) with one video<br>
channel each, further localization (i.e. more zoning) can be achieved due to<br>
simultaneous acquisition of these channels is possible in many image-processing<br>
systems.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
More than one sensing modules can be used together for further increase of number of<br>
zones.<br>
By using three simultaneous video channels, three sensing modules can be operated at<br>
the same time, thereby increasing the number of zones to 36.<br>
The number of array elements given here are 4X3 = 12m, which can be further<br>
increased by reducing the spacing to the physical limits of the standard connectors<br>
and appropriately changing the spacing of the glass.<br>
The device gives 191X191 pixel resolution for each of the 12 circular speckle pattern<br>
which is sufficient for determining the perturbing force.<br>
The device allows sensing of many different environmental perturbation parameters at<br>
a time.<br>
The device is suitable for monitoring and controlling of various perturbing factors<br>
multiplexed using a device.<br>
The device allows standard CCD camera for image acquisition and also allows<br>
parallel and concurrent sensing of environment from at least 12 zones.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
