COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10, Rule 13]<br>
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE VAPORIZER;<br><br><br>
AMERICAN STERILIZER COMPANY, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTINQ UNDER THE LAWS OF UNITED STATES Ot AMERICA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 5960 HEISLEV ROAD, MENTOR, OHIO 44060-1834, U.S.A.<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE; PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the generation of vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and more particularly, to a system for generating large amounts of vaporized hydrogen peroxide and a method of operating the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is known to use hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in sterilization and other processes. In a sterilization process, liquid hydrogen peroxide is vaporized to form vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). The vaporized hydrogen peroxide is typically produced from a liquid mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water. Care must be taken when vaporizing this mixture due to the difference in the boiling points between water and hydrogen peroxide. In this respect, water boils at 100°C, whereas pure hydrogen peroxide boils at 150°C. Accordingly, when a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide is vaporized, the water tends to boil before the hydrogen peroxide unless the mixture is flash vaporized. In conventional systems, flash vaporization is accomplished by dripping a small amount of the water and the hydrogen peroxide mixture on a hot surface. Air is directed over the hot surface to conduct away the vaporized hydrogen peroxide.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 2,491,732 discloses a conventional vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) vaporizer. A problem with the aforementioned drip method of vaporization is that a hot surface must be maintained to vaporize the liquid hydrogen peroxide and water mixture. Testing has shown that an injection rate of up to 5 grams per minute per injection port can be achieved with current drip-method vaporizers. At higher injection rates, individual droplets can no longer be maintained. In other words, the drip-type vaporizer is limited in the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide it can produce within given size limits. This limitation prevents drip-type vaporizers from being used in certain high volume sterilizing processes where it is necessary to sterilize large numbers of articles and devices in a short period of time.<br><br><br>
Another problem with vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination systems is preventing condensation of the vaporized hydrogen peroxide on the articles or surfaces to be decontaminated.<br>
It is therefore desirable to have a high-capacity vaporized hydrogen peroxide generator capable of generating high volumes of vaporized hydrogen peroxide at concentration levels that will not condensate on the articles or surfaces to be decontaminated.<br>
The present invention provides a hydrogen peroxide vaporizer capable of generating large volumes of vaporized hydrogen peroxide at concentration levels that will not condensate on the articles or surfaces to be decontaminated.<br>

Sterilant SUPPIV Unit 100<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, sterilant supply unit 100 is best seen. A supply line 112 connects sterilant supply unit 100 to an external supply 114 of liquid sterilant. A pump and drain assembly 120 is connected to supply line 112. Pump and drain assembly 120 includes a pump 122 driven by a motor 124. Pump 122 and motor 124 are designed to convey metered amounts of liquid sterilant to a reservoir assembly 130.<br>
Reservoir assembly 130 preferably includes two reservoir tanks 132A, 132B. Two sterilant holding tanks 132A, 132B are provided to allow continuous, uninterrupted flow of sterilant to vaporizer units 300A, 300B. In this respect, one holding tank 132A may be filled with sterilant, while the other tank 132B is being used to provide sterilant to vaporizer units 300A, 300B, as shall be described in greater detail below. Tanks 132A, 132B are essentially identical, and therefore, only tank 132A shall be described in detail. It being understood that the description of tank 132A applies to tank 132B.<br><br><br>
Tank 132A is generally columnar in shape, and is comprised of a tubular shell or wall 134 having a base 136 and a cover 138 at the ends thereof. In a preferred embodiment, tubular shell 134 is cylindrical in shape and is formed of a translucent material. Tank 132A defines an inner chamber 142 for holding a liquid sterilant S. Supply line 112 is connected to reservoir tanks 132A, 132B by branch supply lines 112a, 112b. Valves 144, 146 are disposed respectively in branch supply lines 112a, 112b to control flow of liquid sterilant S to reservoir tanks 132A, 132B. Each tank 132A, 132B includes level sensor 154. Sensor 154 is provided to indicate an "overfill level," as shall be described in greater detail below. A pressure sensor 155 is provided at the bottom of each tank 132A, 132B to provide pressure signals that are indicative of the level of fluid in each tank 132A, 132B.<br>
Tanks 132A, 132B are connected at their bottom ends to a holding tank 170 by fluid conduits 162, 164, respectively. Control valves 166, 168 are disposed respectively in fluid conduits 162, 164 to control the flow of sterilant from reservoir tanks 132A, 132B to holding tank 170. The upper ends of reservoir tanks 132A, 132B are connected to a vent line 158, as schematically illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
Holding tank 170 defines air enclosed holding chamber 172. A vent line 174 extends upwardly from holding chamber 172. A control valve 176 is disposed within vent line 174 to control flow therethrough. As best seen in FIG. 2, vent line 174 has a length such that the upper end of vent line 174 is disposed at the upper ends of reservoir tanks 132A, 132B. A level sensor 177 is disposed within holding chamber 172 of holding tank 170 at a predetermined level. A level sensor 177 is disposed within holding tank 170. In the embodiment shown, level sensor 177 is a float switch.<br>
A fluid conduit 184 extending from the bottom of holding tank 170 connects holding chamber 172 to a control valve 186 mat regulates flow of sterilant from holding tank 170 to either a vaporizer feed line 192 or to a drain line 194 that is connected to supply line 112. As illustrated in FIG. 2, drain line 194 is in fluid communication with drain line 126 of pump and drain assembly 120. A return line 196 extends from vaporizer feed line 192 to the top of tank 132A. A control valve 198 is disposed within return line 196 to control the flow of sterilant therethrough.<br><br><br>
Vaporizer feed line 192 is connected to vaporizer unit 300A and vaporizer unit 300B, as illustrated in the drawings. Sterilant from holding tank 170 is preferably fed by gravity to vaporizer units 300A, 300B. Accordingly, in the embodiment shown, holding tank 170 and reservoir tanks 132A, 132B are disposed above vaporizer units 300A, 300B, i.e., at a higher elevation. Air Conditioning Unit 200<br>
,   "	Referring now to FIG.  5, the air conditioning unit 200 is best<br>
illustrated. Air conditioning unit 200 is provided to condition, i.e., to filter and to dry air used in vaporizer units 300A, 300B, and to filter air used by aeration units 700A, 700B. Air conditioning unit 200 is basically comprised of a filter 222, a cooling assembly 230 and a desiccant wheel 242 arranged in series.<br>
An air inlet conduit 212 has a first end 212a that communicates with the environment, namely room air. Another end 212b of air inlet conduit 212 is connected to chamber 262 within air conditioning unit 200. Filter 222 is disposed within air inlet conduit 212 to filter air flowing therethrough. Filter 222 is preferably a HEPA filter. Cooling assembly 230 is disposed downstream from filter 222. Cooling assembly 230 is comprised of a cooling coil 232 and a chiller 234 that is connected to cooling coil 232. Cooling coil 232 surrounds air inlet conduit 212. Chiller 234 is dimensioned to provide sufficient cooling to coil 232 surrounding air inlet conduit 212 such that air flowing through air inlet conduit 212 is chilled to precipitate moisture within the air. In other words, chiller 234 has sufficient capacity to dehumidify air flowing through air inlet conduit 212. Between filter 222 and cooling coil 232, an air supply line 214 is connected to air inlet conduit 212. Air supply line 214 provides filtered air throughout system 10 to cool electronics (not shown). A second air supply line 216 is connected to air inlet conduit 212 between filter 222 and cooling coil 232. Second air supply line 216 provides filtered air to aeration units 700A, 700B, as shall be described in greater detail below. Desiccant wheel 242, rotatable about a first axis "A," is disposed at end 212b of air inlet conduit 212, i.e., downstream from filter 222 and cooling coil 232. Desiccant wheel 242 is disposed such that half of wheel 242 rotates into chamber 262. End 212b of air inlet conduit 212 directs air flow through that portion of desiccant wheel 242 that is positioned within chamber 262. Desiccant<br><br><br>
material within desiccant wheel 242 is operable to absorb moisture in the air flowing through air inlet conduit 212. Thus, air entering chamber 262 has been filtered and dried by means of filter 222, cooling coil 232 and desiccant wheel 242. A humidity sensor 272 and a temperature sensor 274 are disposed within chamber 262 to monitor respectively the humidity and temperature of the air within chamber 262. Chamber 262 is in fluid communication with vaporizer units 300A, 300B via air line 282, as illustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
Air conditioning unit 200 includes a regeneration system 290 for regenerating, i.e., removing moisture from, desiccant wheel 242. A regeneration conduit 292 is connected to chamber 262. A blower 294, driven by a motor 296, draws dried and filtered air within chamber 262 and directs the dried air through a heater 298 that heats the dry air. Regeneration conduit 292 is arranged to direct the heated, dried, filtered air through that portion of desiccant wheel 242 that is outside of chamber 262. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the heated air dries, i.e., removes moisture from desiccant wheel 242. Moist air flowing from desiccant wheel 242 through regeneration conduit 292 flows out of air conditioning unit 200 through an orifice 284. A pressure transducer 285 is disposed at the outlet, i.e., downstream, of blower 294. Pressure transducer 285, in conjunction with orifice 284, is used to establish a desired air flow through conduit 292, to ensure proper moisture removal.

As provided in the present invention, by controlling the air temperature, air flow rate, sterilant temperature and sterilant injection rate in a decontamination system, a desired concentration of vaporized hydrogen peroxide can be maintained within a decontamination chamber. When using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) in a decontamination system, it is necessary to prevent the vaporized hydrogen peroxide from condensing on the products or articles to be decontaminated. In a steady state, steady flow vaporized hydrogen peroxide process, the sterilant injection rate, the air flow rate and the air temperature must be controlled to prevent condensation. According to the present invention, the hydrogen peroxide vaporizer system is controlled to a desired vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration and temperature, to prevent condensation. According to one aspect of the present invention, the operation of system 10 is controlled to maintain the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in an air stream at a dew point temperature that is below the temperature of articles to be decontaminated. System 10 is controlled based upon a mathematical model that shall now be described.<br>
It is known that the dew point concentration of a water and hydrogen peroxide sterilant is dependant on the temperature of the air - into which the sterilant<br><br><br>
is injected ~ and the concentration of the water and peroxide in the air. In the case of a steady state, steady flow process, as is used with vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination equipment, the dew point concentration is dependant on the injection rate of the sterilant and the temperature and the volumetric flow of air past the injector.<br>
The concentration of hydrogen peroxide Cp in the air stream (mg/liter) can be determined by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(1)<br><br>
where:<br>
I = sterilant injection rate (grams/min) F = air flow rate (actual ft3/min) P = percent of peroxide in sterilant<br>
E = vaporizer efficiency (0,90 = 90%) which is a function of the amount of hydrogen peroxide broken down in the vaporization process.<br>
In the equation, the 1000 is a conversion factor for converting grams to milligrams. The 28.32 is a conversion factor for converting cubic feet to liters.<br>
The concentration of water vapor Cw in the air stream (mg/liter) can be determined by the following equation:<br><br><br>

From equations (1) and (2), the concentration of water and hydrogen peroxide in the air stream can be determined. The dew point of the hydrogen peroxide is determined based on the following.<br>
It is known that when liquid of a given concentration of H2O2 is placed in an enclosure with no initial humidity, the liquid hydrogen peroxide and water will evaporate and reach equilibrium in the enclosure. The concentration of the hydrogen peroxide vapor will be lower than hydrogen peroxide concentration found in the liquid. From known sources, such as a book entitled: "Hydrogen Peroxide" by Schumb, Satterfield, &amp; Wentworth ©1955, equations and a table provide the relationship between the liquid and gas concentrations for H2O2 and water. Within an enclosure, the vapor concentration will reach the saturation point.<br>

The mole fraction of hydrogen peroxide (xp) is determined by the<br>
following equation (taken from H202.com).<br>
(7)	xp = (Percent * MWW) / (MWP * (100 - Percent) + Percent * MWW)<br>
where:<br>
Percent = Percent hydrogen peroxide in gas or liquid form.<br>
MWW — Molecular weight of water = 18.016 grams/mole.<br>
MWP = Molecular weight of hydrogen peroxide = 34.016 grams/mole. The vapor pressure  of water is determined  using the following equations (from the ASHRAE Fundamentals book).   For temperatures above 32° F, the following equation is given:<br><br><br>

C13 = 6.5459673<br>
The vapor pressure of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide is determined by the following equation.<br>
(9) <br>
where:<br>

T = Vapor temperature (K)<br>
The ideal gas law can be used to calculate the saturation level of the<br>
hydrogen peroxide and water vapor components at a given temperature, as shown in<br>
reference 2. The ideal gas law is determined by the following equation.<br>
(10)	PV = nRT<br>
where:<br>

R ~ Universal Gas Constant (0.082 liter-atm/moIe-K)<br>
T = Temperature of vapor (K)<br>
The saturated concentration of peroxide or water vapor is usually given in mass per unit volume. Equation (10) can be arranged to determine concentration as given in equation (11) below.<br>

(12) <br>
where:<br>
Pc = Percent hydrogen peroxide in vapor form.<br>
Cp.,c= Concentration of hydrogen peroxide from equation (11) (mg/liter)<br>
Cw..c = Concentration of water from equation (11) (mg/liter)<br>
The percent of hydrogen peroxide in vapor form calculated with<br>
equation (12) can be compared to the percent of hydrogen  peroxide calculated using<br>
equations (0 and (2).<br>
(13) <br>
where:<br>
P = Theoretical percent of hydrogen peroxide in air stream.<br>
Cp &amp; Cw are explained in equations (1) and (2) above.<br>
The percent of peroxide calculated in equation (12) should match that calculated in equation (13). As explained above, if the percentage of hydrogen peroxide in tne sterilanl is used in equation (7), the percentage found using equation (12) will be too low. The equations can be forced to produce the correct saturated vapor concentration from equation (12) by increasing the concentration (Percent) of<br><br><br>
liquid hydrogen peroxide used in equation (7) until the concentration found using equations (12) and (13) match.<br>
Inlet air temperature must be sufficient to vaporize the sterilant and provide an outlet temperature high enough to prevent condensation downstream. The required temperature at the inlet to the vaporizer tube is determined as follows.<br>
The heat required to vaporize the hydrogen peroxide is mostly due to the latent heat of vaporization for the hydrogen peroxide. To a smaller extent, the sensible heat is needed to heat the liquid sterilant from room temperature to vaporization temperature. The heat of vaporization (latent heat) as a function of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in water is given in FIG. 10, provided courtesy of H202.com.<br>

where:<br>
m = air mass flow rate = (0.075 1bm/scf) x scfm (lbm/min)<br>
Cp = specific heat of air at the bulk temperature (BTU/lbm-R)<br>

Referring now to the operation of system 10, a controller (not shown) is programmed to allow system 10 to operate in three different modes of operation, namely: (1) operating to maintain a desired dew point temperature within decontamination chambers 500a, 500b, (2) operating at a fixed rate of sterilant<br><br><br>
injection, and (3) operating so as to hold a desired peroxide concentration. The controller receives input signals from the various sensors throughout system 10. In addition, the controller is programmed, based upon the foregoing equations, to control the heating elements 298, 352, 752, blower motors 294, 322, 632, 712, and pump motors 124, 324, 428 in accordance with a selected mode of operation.<br>
Referring first to the first mode of operation that maintains a specific dew point in the decontamination chambers,'certain user inputs are required for this mode of operation. Specifically, the user inputs the following: (a) a desired dew point temperature (TdP), (b) a desired vaporizer outlet temperature, and (c) the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant.<br>
When vaporized hydrogen peroxide sensor 552 is used, the dew point can be calculated. When no sensor is available, it may be estimated using equations (1) and (2) to calculate the water and peroxide concentrations (assuming efficiency is known).<br>
As is known by those skilled in the art, a dew point temperature is the temperature at which water vapor and hydrogen peroxide vapor in the air become saturated and condensation begins. In the context of the present invention, the objective of system 10 when operated in the first mode of operation is to control the air temperature, air flow, and concentration of water and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) in the air stream so as to prevent condensation on articles 12 to be sterilized. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the temperature of articles 12 to be sterilized is a factor in determining an actual dew point temperature. In the embodiment shown, articles 12 are to be conveyed through a decontamination chamber 500A or 500B. The initial temperature of articles 12 entering chamber 500A or 50013 is important in determining the desired dew point temperature (Tdp)- The desired dew point temperature is determined based upon the initial temperature of articles 12 entering decontamination chamber 500A or 500B. To ensure that condensation does not form on articles 12, "the desired dew point temperature," also referred to as a "pre-selected temperature," inputted into the system is preferably a specific number of degrees lower than the initial temperatures of articles 12 when entering decontamination chamber 500A or 500B.   In a preferred embodiment, the<br><br><br>
desired dew point temperature is selected to be approximately 30°C lower than the initial temperature of articles 12 when entering decontamination chamber 500A or 500B. It will, of course, be appreciated that the added temperature factor could be increased or decreased, so long as it remains lower than the initial temperature of articles 12.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the lower the temperature of articles 12 to be sterilized when entering the decontamination chamber, the lower the dew point temperature at which the water and hydrogen peroxide vapor will condense on articles 12.<br>
The second piece of data inputted by the user is a desired vaporizer outlet temperature. To a certain extent, these data are also dependent on the physical properties of articles 12 to be decontaminated. In this respect, it may be necessary to operate system 10 below a certain temperature to avoid damaging articles 12.<br>
The third piece of data inputted by the user is the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant. This information is provided by the supplier of the liquid sterilant.<br>
Based upon the foregoing inputted information, the system operates in the first mode of operation as follows.<br>
Initially, both reservoir tanks 132A, 132B in sterilant supply unit 100 are preferably filled with liquid sterilant. Liquid sterilant is provided to the respective tanks by pump 122. Tanks 132A, 132B are preferably filled to a desired fill level, indicated by level sensor 154 in each tank 132A, 132B.<br>
Preferably, one tank 132A or 132B is used to provide liquid sterilant to vaporizer units 300A, 300B at any one time. Once a given tank 132A or 132B is depleted of liquid sterilant, liquid sterilant from the other tank 132A or 132B is then used to supply vaporizer units 300A, 300B. An empty tank 132A or 132B can be refilled by opening the appropriate valves 144, 146 to empty tank 132A or 132B and by pumping liquid sterilant from external supply 114 into the empty tank. While an empty tank 132A or 132B is being filled, the other tank 132A or 132B is used to supply vaporizer units 300A, 300B. Tanks 132A, 132B are dimensioned to allow continued operation of decontaminating system 10 while a tank 132A or 132B is being<br><br><br>
refilled. As a result, a generally continuous flow of sterilant can be provided simultaneously to vaporizers 300A, 300B to allow continuous processing of articles 12.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, liquid sterilant from tanks 132A, 132B are directed to holding tank 170. Holding tank 170 is dimensioned to allow any gases that may have been released from the liquid sterilant to be vented from supply unit 100 prior to entering vaporizer units 300A, 300B. In this respect, it has been found that the outer dimensions of holding tank 170, being significantly larger than the feed lines and conduit in system 10, allows gas in the liquid sterilant to be released and vented, and prevents such gas bubbles or pockets from flowing to vaporizer units 300A, 300B.<br>
As previously indicated, sterilant supply unit 100 is a gravity-feed system. To avoid trapping gas bubbles in vaporizer feed line 192, all conduit and piping forming vaporizer feed line 192 from holding tank 170 to vaporizer units 300A, 300B have a downward slope such that any gas released by the liquid sterilant within vaporizer feed line 192 migrates to holding tank 170 where it can be released through vent line 174. Valve 176 in vent line 174 is controlled by float switch 177.<br>
Referring now to the operation of vaporizer units 300A, 300B as shown in FIG. 3, the operation of vaporizer unit 300A shall now be described, it being understood that such description applies also to vaporizer unit 300B. The controller of system 10 causes motor 324 to drive blower 322, thereby drawing air through the air-conditioning unit 200 and blowing the air into vaporizer 360 through vertical conduit 328. The air flow created by blower 322 is measured by flow element 332. As indicated above, motor 324 is preferably an electrically-controlled variable-speed motor wherein the air flow created through vaporizer 360 can be adjusted automatically by the controller. Heating element 352 is energized to heat the air entering vaporizer plenum 364. The output of heating element 352 may be adjusted by varying the duty cycle to heating element 352. In other words, the temperature of the air flowing into vaporizer plenum 364 can be adjusted by adjusting the output of healer element 352.<br>
When system 10 is initially started up, air from blower 322 is forced through plenum 364 and through decontamination chamber 500A. Heated air is blown<br><br><br>
through system 10 to allow components thereof to heat up until the temperature of system 10 stabilizes. Temperature sensors 274,286, 336,452,454, 546, 626, 662 and 664 throughout system 10 monitor the temperature of the air within system 10 and determine when the system has reached an equilibrium temperature based upon the input temperature of heating element 352 as measured by temperature sensor 336.<br>
Once the temperature of system 10 has stabilized, liquid sterilant is injected into the heated air stream by injector system 410. The amount of sterilant injected into the system is established by the controller based upon calculations using the equations set forth above. The initial injection of liquid sterilant into the heated stream creates a pressure increase within vaporizer plenum 364 as a result of the liquid sterilant vaporizing in the heated air stream. This increase in pressure within vaporizer plenum 364 will result in reduced air flow into vaporizer 360. This drop in air flow will be sensed by flow element 332. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the operation of blower motor 322 is controlled by the sensed air flow through flow element 332. Based upon output signals from flow element 332 and sensor 334, the controller increases the speed of blower 322 to maintain the desired air flow through vaporizer plenum 364 and the downstream units. In this respect, system 10 is self-adjusting to maintain a desired air flow rate through system 10 while vaporized hydrogen peroxide is being generated. The vaporized hydrogen peroxide from vaporizer unit 360 is conveyed into decontamination chamber 500A through peroxide feed line 512A. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, for safety reasons vaporizer unit 360 is located above decontamination chamber 500A, as shown in FIG. 3. In this respect, any hydrogen peroxide not vaporized in vaporizer unit 360 will remain in a liquid state and drip or flow downward into decontamination chamber 500A. The dripping or flowing of liquid hydrogen peroxide into decontamination chamber 500A may be ascertained from a visual inspection of decontamination chamber 500A. If liquid hydrogen peroxide is noticed in decontamination chamber 500A, the system is shut down to avoid a hazardous condition.<br>
The vaporized hydrogen peroxide enters manifold 542 where it is dispensed over the articles 12 through nozzles 544.    In this respect, as will be<br><br><br>
appreciated, articles 12 begin to move through decontamination chamber 500A once steady-state operation of vaporizer 360 has been established.<br>
As schematically illustrated in the drawings, the vaporized hydrogen peroxide is directed over articles 12 from above. Blower 632 in destroyer unit 600A is energized to draw the vaporized hydrogen peroxide out of decontamination chamber 500A through line 612. Flow element 622 provides signals indicative of the flow to blower 632. The controller controls the operation of blower 632 so as to balance the air flow out of decontamination chamber 500A with the flow of air through vaporizer plenum 364. The air stream drawn from decontamination chamber 500A is forced through destroyer 642 where the vaporized hydrogen is broken down into oxygen and water that is exhausted from system 10, as schematically illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
As indicated above, during this mode of operation, i.e., wherein the system is controlled to maintain the concentration of water vapor and vaporized hydrogen peroxide in decontamination chamber 500A at a desired dew point temperature, the controller of system 10 constantly monitors the various sensors throughout system 10 to ensure that the proper amount of liquid hydrogen peroxide sterilant is being injected into injection system 410.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, system 10 monitors and verifies the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide produced within system 10 in several ways. According to a first method of measuring the vaporized hydrogen peroxide {VHP), system 10 monitors the temperature drop across destroyer 642 using temperature sensors 662 and 664. In this respect, the destruction of vaporized hydrogen peroxide produces heat. By monitoring the change in temperature across destroyer 642, a first indication of the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide flowing through the system can be determined.<br>
A second method of measuring and monitoring the vaporized hydrogen peroxide within system 10 is through measurements from vaporized hydrogen peroxide sensor 462 or 552.<br>
A third method of measuring and monitoring the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system 10 is by monitoring the injection rate of liquid sterilant into injection system 410.   In this respect, the output of mass meter 427 can be<br><br><br>
monitored to provide an indication of the metered amounts of liquid sterilant to injection system 410. The peroxide and water concentrations are calculated using equations 1 and 2.<br>
A fourth method of measuring and monitoring the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system 10 is to monitor the temperature change within vaporizer plenum 364. Specifically, temperature sensors 452 and 454 within vaporizer plenum 364 are monitored. Just as the destruction of vaporized hydrogen peroxide produces a specific amount of heat per unit mass, so, too, does the vaporization of liquid hydrogen peroxide require a specific amount of heat which produces a decrease in temperature. By monitoring the change in temperature in the air stream within vaporizer plenum 364, the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system 10 can be determined.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, system 10 monitors all four of the foregoing conditions and compares the output calculations to each other. If any one of the four monitored parameters is outside an acceptable range of error, system 10 alerts the system operator of potential problems.<br>
By continuously monitoring the sensors throughout system 10, the concentration of water vapor and hydrogen peroxide vapor within the air stream can be maintained at a desired dew point temperature. Since, as indicated above, the desired operating dew point temperature is preferably approximately 30°C below the temperatures of articles 12 entering the decontamination chamber, condensation on such articles 12 can be avoided.<br>
The present invention thus provides a system 10 that can operate to maintain a specific dew point temperature, to prevent water vapor or vaporized hydrogen peroxide from condensating on articles 12 and, at the same time, maintain a desired operating temperature so as not to damage articles 12 to be decontaminated.<br>
Referring now to the second mode of operation, i.e., wherein system 10 is held to a predetermined injection rate, the user is required to once again input a desired manifold 542 temperature, and the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant. In this mode of operation, once a steady state flow has been established, the injection rate of injection system 410 is maintained at a set amount. Air flow through<br><br><br>
the system may increase to maintain a desired operating temperature, however, the injection rate remains constant throughout the operation in this mode. The dew point is supplied to the user so a determination can be made if condensation will occur.<br>
In the third mode of operation, i.e., wherein the vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration is held steady, the user inputs a desired operating temperature of the manifold 542. Once steady-state air flow has been established through the system, liquid hydrogen peroxide is injected into the air stream. As indicated above, system 10 monitors the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system 10 and maintains the desired vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration by increasing or decreasing the injection rate of pump 426 of injection system 410.<br>
The control strategy for the first mode of operation is carried out as follows:<br>
1.)      The user inputs the following:<br>
a.	The desired dew point temperature (TdP)<br>
b.	The manifold temperature.<br>
c.	The percent hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant<br>
2.)      The following is known:<br>
a.	Vaporizer efficiency (E) found through testing. (When a near<br>
IR sensor 462 is used, equations 1 and 2 are not required to<br>
determine the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and water.<br>
When a near IR sensor 462 is not used, equations 1 and 2 are<br>
used to calculate the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and<br>
water. This calculation requires that the efficiency of the<br>
vaporizer be inputted by the user into the controller of<br>
decontamination system 10.)<br>
b.	Concentration of water in the air stream out of the dryer, from<br>
vendor data or from testing.<br>
3.) Initially assume the vapor out of the vaporizer will contain the same percentage of hydrogen peroxide as the liquid sterilant<br>
4.) Calculate the mole fraction of hydrogen peroxide (xp) in the sterilant using equation 7.<br><br><br>
5.)      Calculate the mole fraction of water in the sterilant, xw - 1 - xp<br>
6.)      Calculate the activity coefficients using equations 5 and 6 at the dew<br>
point temperature input by the user. 7.)      Calculate the vapor pressure of water and hydrogen peroxide using<br>
equations 8 and 9 at the dew point temperature input by the user. 8.)      Calculate the total vapor pressure using equation 4. 9.)      Determine the mole fraction of hydrogen peroxide in gas over liquid<br>
using equation 3. 10.)    Determine if the mole fraction calculated using equation 7 equals<br>
that calculated using equation 3. 11.)    If the mole fractions don't match within an acceptable error, iterate<br>
the mole fraction of peroxide in the sterilant (liquid state) and redo<br>
steps 5 through 10 above. One of many iteration techniques may be<br>
used to converge to the solution. 12.)    If the mole fractions match within the acceptable enor, calculate the<br>
saturated concentration of the hydrogen peroxide (Ch,sat)  and water<br>
(Cw,sat) using equation 11. 13.)    Calculate the sterilant injection rate from equation 1 using Ch,sat 14.)    Calculate the concentration of water (Cw) using equation 2. 15.)    Compare Cw with Cw,sat 16.)    If Cw and Cw,sat are not equal within an acceptable errorN recalculate<br>
the percentage of peroxide (P) using Ch,sat and Cw:  P=Ch,sat/Ch,sat +<br>
Cw) 100 and redo steps 4 through 15. 17.)    If Cw and Cw,sat are within acceptable error, the initial injection rate<br>
will be set equal to that calculated in step 15 above. 18.)    Calculate the heat of vaporization (Qvap) using equation 14. 19.)    Determine the vaporizer inlet air temperature (T1) using equation 16. 20.)    If the air temperature calculated in step 19 is not too great for<br>
downstream components, the air flow can be established at T1 and<br>
the peroxide can be injected into the air stream after the system has<br>
reached steady state.<br><br><br>
21.)    If the air temperature, T1 is too great for downstream components,<br>
the temperature may be initially set to the maximum allowable<br>
temperature, 22.)    The injection rate can then be determined by iterating until the<br>
vaporizer outlet temperature is above the dew point by the same<br>
margin as that between the desired dew point temperature (Tdp) and<br>
the desired outlet temperature (T2)-23.)    A gradual step-up process can be continued until the required dew<br>
point (Tdp) and outlet (T2) temperatures are achieved. 24.)    If feedback is provided to the control, the dew point can be achieved<br>
by using the actual concentration of hydrogen peroxide and water<br>
instead of those calculated in equations 1 and 2.<br>
The control strategy for the second mode of operation is set forth as follows.<br>
1.)      The user inputs the following:<br>
a.	The desired injection rate<br>
b.	The manifold temperature.<br>
c.	The percent hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant<br>
2.)      The following is known:<br>
a.	Vaporizer efficiency (E) found through testing (used when near<br>
IR sensor is not used).<br>
b.	Concentration of water in the air stream out of the dryer, from<br>
vendor data or from testing.<br>
3.) The controller calculates and displays a dew point based upon the injection rate set by the user.<br>
4.) The user, knowing the dew point for the inputted injection rate, can then, if necessary, adjust, i.e., change, the "user inputs" to avoid condensation on the articles to be decontaminated. In this respect, in the second mode of operation, there is no automatic control of the dew point.<br><br><br>
