Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
is  a known anxiolytic active principle having the INN "deramciclane  fumarate".<br>
The  compound of  Formula  I   falls  under the general Formula  I  of  Hungarian patent No.   179,164 but has not been actually and explicitly disclosed in  this patent specification,   nor  the preparation  thereof has been<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
exemplified.   According  to  Hungarian patent No.   179,164   the alkanol  amine   cycloalkyl  ethers   of  its  general  Formula   I are prepared by  reacting   ( +) -1, 7 , 7 - tri- [methyl] --bicycle [2 . 2 .1] heptane-2-one,   i.   e.    (+}-camphor  of  Formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
with  the  corresponding organic metal  compound,   subjecting the adduct  obtained to hydrolysis and introducing onto   the hydroxy group  of  the product obtained the basic  side   chain by  etherification.  As  organic metal  compound a  Grignard compound or  an organic alkali metal  compound,   preferably lithium or  sodium compound,   is  used.<br>
The preparation of   the  compound of  Formula   I  has  been actually disclosed in Hungarian patent No.   212,574.   The essence of   this process   is  that purification of   the  product is   carried out  at a later stage of  the synthesis.  According to  the process   (+)-camphor of  Formula II  is  subjected  to Grignard reaction with phenyl magnesium bromide  in diethyl ether  to  give   (1R,2S,4R) -(-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol of  Formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with a yield of 28%   (according  to GO .   The compound (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl]--bicyclo [2 . 2 .1] heptane-2-ol  of  Formula  III   is   in  the reaction mixture  and  is not  isolated.   The  complex  is decomposed,   the reaction mixture is   converted without purification  into  the sodium salt by reaction with  sodium amide  or  sodium hydride and  the  sodium salt obtained  is reacted with anhydrous   (2-{chloro}-ethyl) -dimethylamine in  toluene  as  medium.   The reaction mixture  contains   beside the base   (1R, 23, 4R) - (-)-2-[ (2 '-{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2 .1] heptane of Formula  I   (being present   in an<br>
amount  of   20   to  30%	a considerable  amount  of<br>
impurities   and starting materials,   e.g.   unreacted   (+)--camphor  of   Formula  II,    (1R, 2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7--tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol,   1,7 ,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol  and biphenyl,<br>
triphenyl   impurities,   etc.   The base   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[ (2'-<br>
-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy} ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2 .2 .1]heptane of Formula  I  is   separated<br>
from said  contaminations by extraction with aqueous<br>
tartaric  acid,   whereupon the base is  set  free  and  the<br>
fumarate  salt  is  formed.   The total  amount of unreacted<br>
( + ) -camphor  of  Formula II  and   (1R, 2S, 4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl] --1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol  of  Formula III remains   in the organic phase of  the tartaric acid extraction  step,   which can be re-used in  the Grignard reaction after removing the solvent  and water   (i.e.   it  can be re-circulated into  the process) .   Thus   the   ( + )-camphor used can be more efficiently utilized;   without  re-<br>
-	circulation only about 16% by weight of  the   ( + ) -camphor<br>
used can be utilized,   while  in case  of  a  one-fold and<br>
three-fold re-circulation this value  is   increased  to  22% by<br>
weight  and  25% by weight,   respectively.<br>
It   is  very important and is  to be  emphasized  that a considerable part of   ( + ) -camphor of   Formula  II  used  in  the<br>
Grignard reaction  does not  react and  this  starting material cannot be  technically removed from the desired product because  of   the physical  properties  of    (+)-camphor  and  the lability  of   the  compound   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7--tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1]heptane-2-o^  of Formula   III formed since  compound   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2- [phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.1] heptane-2-ol   of  Formula  III   is<br>
susceptible to decomposition.   For this  reason  according to<br>
the process  disclosed  in Hungarian patent No.   212,574   the<br>
alkylation step always   takes  place  in  the presence  of   (+)-<br>
-camphor  of  Formula  II.<br>
The aforesaid gives  rise  to   the  drawbacks   of   the process   disclosed  in Hungarian patent No.   212,574.   The alkali hydrides  and amides  used in the  first  step of  the alkylation  reaction  form  salts  not  only  with  the  alcohol<br>
(1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol  of Formula  III but  also  with<br>
( + ) -camphor of Formula II and other compounds containing an active hydrogen atom being present in the reaction mixture. For this reason beside the desired compound (1R, 2S, 4R) - {-) --2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane  of Formula I  further<br>
alkylated derivatives  formed,   e.g.   from unreacted<br>
( + ) -camphor,   are obtained and  the desired compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) 1-2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2.1] heptane  of<br>
Formula I  is  to be recovered  from a mixture containing such<br>
impurities  and also unreacted compounds   ( + ) -camphor  and<br>
(1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol  of Formulae  II and  III.<br>
The  crude  compound   (1R, 2S,4R)-(-)-2-[(2'--{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri -<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane  of Formula I  can only be<br>
purified,   though  incompletely,   by means   of<br>
recrystallization  from dimethyl   formamide.  However,   with<br>
the aid of  said recrystallization only non-basic<br>
contaminations can be completely removed, which do not form salts.<br>
A further disadvantage of recrystallization from dimethyl formamide is that the traces of the solvent cannot be removed from the desired pharmaceutical active principle to the required extent. In this regard it is to be noted that according to ICE (International analytical requirements accepted by the US, Japan and the EU) the limit of dimethyl formamide is 880 ppm (0.088% by weight). The reason for that the dimethyl formamide cannot be removed to such an extent but a greater amount of it remains in the product is the high boiling point of dimethyl formamide, on the one hand, and the sensitivity of (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[ (2'--(N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]-2- [phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I to thermal<br>
treatment, on the other hand.<br>
It has been found that in case of the alkylation reaction of (1R, 2S, 4R) - ()-)-2-[phenyl]-1, 7, 7-tri-[methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of Formula III carried out with (2-{chloro}-ethyl)-dimethylamine (+)-camphor of Formula II being always present gives rise to the formation of considerable amounts of by-products, e.g. (1R,3S,4R)-3-<br>
-	[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-one of Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The by-product   (1R, 3S, 4R) -3 - [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino} -<br>
-ethyl) ] -1,7, 7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane-2 -one  of<br>
Formula V  is   formed  as   follows:   under  the conditions   used<br>
in  the  etherification reaction   ( + )-camphor of Formula  II<br>
forms  an alkali  salt  in position 2  which in turn reacts<br>
with the   (2 - {chloro}-ethyl) -dimethylamine used as<br>
alkylating agent  to yield the compound of Formula V.   The<br>
amount of   the by-product  of  Formula V may be as high as   1<br>
to  10%.	The  solubility of   the  fumarate 2-(E)-<br>
-butenedioate   (1   :   1)   of   the compound of   (1R, 3S,4R)-3-[ (2 ' --{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl) ] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-one of  Formula V is  approximately identical  with that  of  the  fumarate of  the desired compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [(21 -{N,N- dime thy lamino}-ethoxy) ] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1, 7, 7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane  of<br>
Formula  I  and  therefore  crystallizes   together with  the<br>
fumarate  of   the  compound   (1R, 2S, 4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1]heptane of  Formula  I  and contaminates   the<br>
desired end product.   If  the etherification is  carried out<br>
in  toluene,   as  described in Hungarian patent No.   212,574,<br>
the product  obtained after  salt  formation in ethanol<br>
contains  considerable amounts  of  the  impurity   (1R,3S,4R)-3-<br>
-	[(21 -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2.l]heptane-2-one of  Formula V.<br>
The  salt  is  a highly unsoluble compound and can be recrystallized only  from dimethyl  formamide.  However, recrystallization  from dimethyl   formamide fails  to provide a  compound   (1R,2S, 4R) - (-)-2-[ (2 '-{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of  Formula  I   in a purity required by the Pharmacopoeias   for the  following reasons:<br>
a)        The product  obtained after recrystallization from dimethyl   formamide still  contains  the compound (1R,3S,4R) -3- [ (2' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -<br>
-1,7, 7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo[2 .2 .1] heptane-2-one of   Formula V in an  amount  above  the   threshold value permitted by  Pharmacopoeia   (about   0.5%);<br>
b)        Dimethyl  formamide  has   a high boiling point   and cannot be removed from the product  in  the required degree because  at  the high  temperature decomposition of  the product  takes place.<br>
A purification  to yield products  with a purity sufficient   for medicaments  according  to   the  Pharmacopoeias could not be  attained by known purification processes,   such as  recrystallization  from solvents  or fractional distillation.   More  specifically,   by known processes   the (1R,2S,4R) - (-)-2- [(2f -(N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]-2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1, 7, 7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane   of<br>
Formula   I   could not be obtained having no more   than   0.2<br>
of   (lR,3S,4R)-3-[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -<br>
-1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2.1] heptane-2-one  of  Formula<br>
V but  only with more  than  0.5%	of  this   impurity.<br>
Taking  into   consideration  the  severe  requirements   of Pharmacopoeia,   impurities being present  in an amount  higher than  0.2% by weight may endanger  the use of  the active principle  for pharmaceutical purposes.   The impurity (1R,3S,4R) -3- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino} -ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-one of  Formula V may<br>
therefore  cause problems  in  the use of  the compound  of<br>
Formula  I  as  active principle.<br>
As  a  summary,   it  can be  stated that when purifying  the (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [(2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1, 7, 7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane of<br>
Formula  I prepared by  the known method,   dimethyl  formamide<br>
would be  the  only conceivable solvent.   However,   this<br>
recrystallization method is  unsuitable  for  the preparation<br>
of  a pharmaceutical  active  ingredient meeting  the<br><br>
requirements of the Pharmacopoeias, because dimethyl formamide has such a high boiling point that traces thereof cannot be removed from the product to a sufficient extent. At the high temperature required the compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2-- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane of Formula I is subject to decomposition.<br>
As already disclosed above, (+)-camphor of Formula II is present during the alkylation reaction. From ( + ) -camphor as further contamination (1R, 4R) -2 - [ (2 ' - {N,N--dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]-l, 7, 7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is  formed.   If an alkali metal  hydride or alkali metal  amide<br>
is  used as basic salt  forming agent,   the amount of  the<br>
contamination   (1R,4R) -2- [ (2 ' - (N, N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]-<br>
-1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of  Formula  IV is<br>
1  to 10%	The compound   (1R, 4R) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]-l,7 ,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2.1] heptane  of  Formula   IV has  been  known   from<br>
the  Prior Art   [Yakugaku  Zasshi,   75.,   1377,    (1955);   Chem.<br>
Abstr.   9340   (1956)].   The  compound   (1R, 4R) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
- dime thy lamino}-ethoxy)j-1,7, 7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane of  Formula  IV  is   formed as  follows:<br>
the alkali metal hydride or alkali metal amide used for<br>
sodium salt formation in the etherification step reduces 1<br>
to 10%	of (+)-camphor of Formula II to borneol<br>
which is converted under the reaction conditions used into the alkali metal salt and said alkali salt enters with (2-{chloro}-ethyl)-dimethylamine into an alkylation reaction. However, the borneol ether (1R,4R)-2-[(2'-{N,N-- dime thy lamino}-ethoxy)]-l, 7, 7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula IV can be separated from the desired compound (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[(2'-[N,N--dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl]--bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I in the course of working up the reaction mixture.<br>
The problem underlying to the invention is to provide (1R,2S,4R)-(-) -2-[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)]--2-[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof containing amounts of (1R,3S,4R)-3-[(2'--{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl]--bicyclo[2.2.1] heptane-2-one of Formula V small enough to meet the requirements of use for pharmaceutical purposes and a process for preparing such compounds without the necessity of recrystallization purification steps which anyhow would lead only to an insufficient purification and would reduce the yield and moreover would have the drawback that the residual solvent could not be removed from the end product to a sufficient extent even by complicated methods, as well as medicaments containing 1 or more of these compounds and their use.<br>
Surprisingly the above has been solved by the present invention which provides a new product that could not be prepared by the Prior Art.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising recognition that if the reaction between the reaction mixture containing the compound (1R,2S, 4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl] --1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III and (2-{chloro}-ethyl)-dimethylamine is carried out in the presence of an alkali metal hydride or alkali metal amide in a medium containing dioxane as solvent, the reaction is directed by far in favour of the formation of the desired (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I and the by-product (1R,3S,4R) -3- [ (2--{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)]-1,7,7-tri-<br>

In the entire text the percentages regarding the contents of the compounds of Formulae I an V and of other compounds are the result of gas chromatographic analysis they being the ratio of the area under the given peak and the total area under all the peaks.<br>
Hence a subject matter of the invention are (IR,2S,4R-(-)-2-{(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino)-ethoxy)1-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-Emethyll bicycio [2.2.1] heptane of Formula<br>
 (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III thus obtained with a (2-{halogeno}-ethyl)-dimethylamine in the presence of a basic salt forming agent in an organic solvent and, if desired, converting the base (1R,2S, 4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ]-2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of Formula I thus obtained into a salt, characterised by carrying out the reaction of (1R,2S,4R) - (-)-2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III and (2--{halogeno}-ethyl)-dimethylamine in a medium containing dioxane as a solvent. The invention is not limited to the use of dioxane as the sole solvent but also comprises the use of a solvent containing at least 50% by weight, preferably 75% by weight, of dioxane.<br>
The essential feature of the process of the present invention is that the alkylation is carried out in a solvent which does not favour the alkylation reaction in position 3 of (+) -camphor of Formula II in the presence of a basic salt forming agent. It has been found that dioxane can be used advantageously for this purpose.<br>
Conveniently a    phenyl    magnesium halide is used as a metallo-organic compound in a Grignard type reaction. Further examples are phenylalkali compounds, such as phenyl1i thium.<br>
Preferably phenyl magnesium bromide is used. Phenyl magnesium chloride can also be used.<br>
Suitably the process according to the invention may be carried out as follows:<br>
In the first step of the process of the present invention ( + ) -camphor of Formula II is subjected to Grignard reaction with, for example, phenyl magnesium bromide. The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se. As reaction medium preferably tetrahydrofurane may be used. Phenyl magnesium bromide may be used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles, preferably about 1.5 mole, related to 1 mole of  (+)-camphor of Formula II. One may proceed preferably by preparing first the Grignard reagent from magnesium and bromo benzene in the solvent used and thereafter adding the solution of the (+)-camphor of Formula II in an organic solvent at the boiling point of the reaction mixture. It is preferred to use the same solvent for the preparation of the Grignard reagent and the dissolving of the (+)-camphor of Formula II. As a solvent advantageously tetrahydrofurane may be used. Advantageously the reaction is carried out at the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture is then cooled and the adduct obtained is hydrolysed. Hydrolysis may be carried out in a known manner, preferably in acidic medium. It is preferred to use hydrochloric acid for this purpose.<br>
The (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of Formula III obtained after decomposition of the Grignard complex can be subjected to alkylation without purifying the reaction mixture containing the same. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of unreacted { + ) -camphor of Formula II. However, this leads to the formation only of a minor amount of alkylated by-products because according to the process of the present invention the formation of (1R,3S,4R)-3-- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dime thy lamino} -ethyl) ] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .l]heptane-2-one of Formula V is suppressed.<br>
As already mentioned above, alkylation is carried out in a solvent which does not favour the alkylation reaction<br>
in position 3 of ( + )-camphor of Formula II, i.e. in which ( + ) -camphor of Formula II is alkylated in position 3 at most only to a very small extent. Dioxane is used as organic solvent because in a medium containing dioxane the alkylation of ( + ) -camphor of Formula II takes place at most only to a very small extent and consequently the amount of the undesired (1R,3S,4R) -3- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dime thy lamino }--ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-one of Formula V in the end product (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
-	dime thy lamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of Formula I is not more than 0.2%<br>
by weight.<br>
The asyunnetrial centres of (1R,2S, 4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
-	dime thylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of Formula I in positions 1 and 4<br>
are derived from the ( + )-1, 7, 7-tri-[methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-one {(+}-camphor) of Formula II.<br>
The alkylation is carried out in the presence of a basic salt forming agent. The term "basic salt forming agent" means basic compounds which convert the hydroxy group into a salt. For this purpose advantageously alkali metal amides, e.g. sodium amide, or alkali metal hydrides, e.g. sodium hydride, may be used. It is preferred to use sodium amide.<br>
Preferably as a (2-{halogeno}-ethyl) -dimethylamine (2-{chloro}-ethyl)-dimethylamine is used.<br>
Suitably the basic salt forming agent is used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles, preferably 1.5 to 2 moles, related to 1 mole of the (1R, 2S,4R) -(-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7 ,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III. The<br>
amount of the alkylating agent is advantageously 1.0 to 2.5<br>
moles, preferably 1 to 1.1 mole, related to the basic salt<br>
forming agent. Preferably the alkylation reaction of<br>
 (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2-[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III with the (2--{halogeno}-ethyl) -dimethylamine is carried out under heating, particularly at the boiling point of the reaction mixture. Suitably the reaction takes place within about 3 to 5 hours. An advantageous reaction time is about 4 hours.<br>
The (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] --2- [phenyl] -1, 7, 7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2.1] heptane of Formula I may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, preferably the fumarate, optionally without isolation of the former. One may preferably proceed as follows: from the reaction mixture obtained after alkylation the inorganic salts are removed by filtration at 0 to 30°C, preferably at 20°C, whereupon the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid, preferably fumaric acid, is added to the filtrate in an approximately equimolar amount (1.0 to 1.5 mole) . The crystalline product precipitated from the medium, such as the dioxane medium, is filtered off.<br>
Since the (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' - {N,N-dime thy lamino}--ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .1]heptane of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, particularly the (IR, 2S, 4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -(N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2 -- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo[2.2 .1]heptane fumarate (1 : 1) obtained by the process according to the invention contain [s] in accordance with the requirements of Pharmacopoeia not more than 0.2% of (1R,3S,4R) -3- [ (2 ' -{N,N--dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-one of Formula V or of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, respectively, by the process according to the invention recrystallization from dimethyl formamide anyhow leading only to insufficient purification used by known methods has been eliminated, and thus there is no need to remove traces<br>
of dimethyl  formamide from the pharmaceutically active principle by methods unsuitable for the given purpose,   too. Also this  latter is  a  significant progress  in view of   the impossibility to remove dimethyl  formamide to  the necessary extent because of  its high boiling  temperature at which (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [(2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2-- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1.]heptane  of Formula I would be decomposed.<br>
The advantage of  the process  of   the present  invention is   that in addition to providing a highly pure product meeting the  strict requirements  of  Pharmacopoeia  it   can be carried out with excellent yields.   Thus   the yield of  about 46% shown in  the Examples  is  considerably higher  than  the yields disclosed in the Prior Art which do not surpass  25% even if   (+)-camphor is re-circulated several times.<br>
A further subject matter of  the  invention are medicaments characterised by that they contain as   [an] principle(s)   1 or more compound(s)   according to the invention within the above definition,   advantageously together with 1 or more in pharmaceutical preparations usual excipient(s).<br>

Suitably  the medicaments according  to  the invention are in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.  They may be prepared by known methods  of  the pharmaceutical  technique. The preparations are preferably suitable  for oral administration,   e.g.   tablets,   coated  tablets,   capsules, solutions,   emulsions or suspensions,   or for parenteral administration,   e.g.   intravenous,   percutaneous  or<br>
intramuscular injactable solutions.   The compositions may contain usual carriers,   e.g.   starch,   lactose and/or calcium carbonate,   and/or water,  polyalkylene glycols,   sodium chloride solution and/or dextrose solution.  The pharmaceutical preparations may  also  contain usual pharmaceutical auxiliary agents,   e.g.   emulsifying, stabilising,   suspending and/or disintegrating agents,   salts to modify the osmotic pressure,   buffers  and/or antioxidants.<br>
A still further, subject matter of the invention is the use of the compounds according to the invention within the above definition for preparing anxiolytic medicaments.<br>

The reaction mixture  is heated  to  boiling until   the magnesium is   completely dissolved.   To   the Grignard compound a solution of  152.2  g (1.0 mole)   of   ( + ) -camphor of Formula  II and 300 ml of anhydrous   tetrahydrofurane  is  added under constant heating to boiling within about half an hour and the reaction mixture  is  heated to boiling for a  further period of  5 hours.<br>
