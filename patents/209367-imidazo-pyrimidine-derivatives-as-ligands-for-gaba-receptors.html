This invention relates to imidazo-pyrimidine derivatives as ligands for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a class of substituted imidazo-pyrimidine derivatives and to their use in therapy. More particularly, this invention is concerned with imidazo[l,2-α]pyrimidine analogues which are substituted in the 3-position by a substituted phenyl ring. These compounds are ligands for GABAA receptors and are therefore useful in the therapy of deleterious mental states.<br>
Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABAA receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily; and (2) GABAB receptors, which may be members of the G-protein linked receptor superfamily. Since the first cDNAs encoding individual GABAA receptor subunits were cloned the number of known members of the mammalian family has grown to include at least six a subunits, four β subunits, three γ subunits, one 5 subunit, one α subunit and two p subunits.<br>
Although knowledge of the diversity of the GABAA receptor gene family represents a huge step forward in our understanding of this ligand-gated ion channel, insight into the extent of subtype diversity is still at an early stage. It has been indicated that an a subunit, α β subunit and a y subunit constitute the minimum requirement for forming a fully functional GABAA receptor expressed by transiently transfecting cDNAs into cells. As indicated above, 5, e and p subunits also exist, but are present only to a minor extent in GABAA receptor populations.<br>
Studies of receptor size and visualisation by electron microscopy conclude that, like other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family, the native GABAA receptor exists in pentameric form. The selection of at least one α, one αβ and one y subunit from a repertoire of seventeen allows for the possible existence of more than 10,000 pentameric subunit combinations. Moreover, this calculation overlooks the additional permutations that would be possible if the arrangement of subunits around the ion channel had no constraints (i.e. there could be 120 possible variants for a receptor composed of five different subunits).<br>
Receptor subtype assemblies which do exist include, amongst many others, alp2y2, a2pyl, a2p2/3y2, a3py2/3, a4p5, a5p3y2/3, a6Py2 and α6β8 . Subtype assemblies containing an al subunit are present in most areas of the brain and are thought to account for over 40% of GABAA receptors in the rat. Subtype assemblies containing al and a3 subunits respectively are thought to account for about 25% and<br><br>
17% of GABAA receptors in the rat. Subtype assemblies containing an a5 subunit are expressed predominantly in the hippocampus and cortex and are thought to represent about 4% of GABAA receptors in the rat.<br>
A characteristic property of all known GABAA receptors is the presence of a number of modulatory sites, one of which is the benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site. The BZ binding site is the most explored of the GABAA receptor modulatory sites, and is the site through which anxiolytic drugs such as diazepam and temazepam exert their effect. Before the cloning of the GABAA receptor gene family, the benzodiazepine binding site was historically subdivided into two subtypes, BZl and BZ2, on the basis of radioligand binding studies. The BZl subtype has been shown to be pharmacologically equivalent to a GABAA receptor comprising the al subunit in combination with α β subunit and y2. This is the most abundant GABAA receptor subtype, and is believed to represent almost half of all GABAA receptors in the brain.<br>
Two other major populations are the α2β Y2 and α3βY2/3 subtypes. Together these constitute approximately a further 35% of the total GABAA receptor repertoire. Pharmacologically this combination appears to be equivalent to the BZ2 subtype as defined previously by radioligand binding, although the BZ2 subtype may also include certain a5-containing subtype assemblies. The physiological role of these subtypes has hitherto been unclear because no sufficiently selective agonists or antagonists were known.<br>
It is now believed that agents acting as BZ agonists at α1βY2, a2Py2 or α3βY2 subtypes will possess desirable anxiolytic properties. Compounds which are modulators of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABAA receptor by acting as BZ agonists are referred to hereinafter as "GABAA receptor agonists". The al-selective GABAA receptor agonists alpidem and Zolpidem are clinically prescribed as hypnotic agents, suggesting that at least some of the sedation associated with known anxiolytic drugs which act at the BZl binding site is mediated through GABAA receptors containing the al subunit. Accordingly, it is considered that GABAA receptor agonists which interact more favourably with the a2 and/or a3 subunit than with al will be effective in the treatment of anxiety with a reduced propensity to cause sedation. Moreover, agents which are inverse agonists of the US subunit are likely to be beneficial in enhancing cognition, for example in subjects suffering from dementing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also, agents which are antagonists or inverse<br><br>
agonists at al might be employed to reverse sedation or hypnosis caused by al agonists.<br>
The compounds of the present invention, being selective ligands for GABAA receptors, are therefore of use in the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of disorders of the central nervous system. Such disorders include anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, animal and other phobias including social phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stress disorders including post-traumatic and acute stress disorder, and generalized or substance-induced anxiety disorder; neuroses; convulsions; migraine; depressive or bipolar disorders, for example single-episode or recurrent major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar I and bipolar II manic disorders, and cyclothymic disorder; psychotic disorders including schizophrenia; neurodegeneration arising from cerebral ischemia; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; speech disorders, including stuttering; and disorders of circadian rhythm, e.g. in subjects suffering from the effects of jet lag or shift work.<br>
Further disorders for which selective ligands for GABAA receptors may be of benefit include pain and nociception; emesis, including acute, delayed and anticipatory emesis, in particular emesis induced by chemotherapy or radiation, as well as motion sickness, and post-operative nausea and vomiting; eating disorders including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; premenstrual syndrome; muscle spasm or spasticity, e.g. in paraplegic patients; hearing disorders, including tinnitus and age-related hearing impairment; urinary incontinence; and the effects of substance abuse or dependency, including alcohol withdrawal. Selective ligands for GABAA receptors may be beneficial in enhancing cognition, for example in subjects suffering from dementing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease; and may also be effective as pre-medication prior to anaesthesia or minor procedures such as endoscopy, including gastric endoscopy.<br>
In addition, the compounds in accordance with the present invention may be useful as radioligands in assays for detecting compounds capable of binding to the human GABAA receptor.<br>
The present invention provides a class of imidazo-pyrimidine derivatives which possess desirable binding properties at various GABAA receptor subtypes. The compounds in accordance with the present invention have good affinity as ligands for the α2 and/or α3 and/or 5 subunit of the human GABAA receptor. The compounds of<br><br>
this invention may interact more favourably with the α2 and/or α3 subunit than with the al subunit; and/or may interact more favourably with the 5 subunit than with the 1 subunit.<br>

The compounds in accordance with this invention may possess at least a 2-fold, suitably at least a 5-fold, and advantageously at least a 10-fold, selective affinity for the α2 and/or α3 and/or 5 subunit relative to the al subunit. However, compounds which are not selective in terms of their binding affinity for the α2 and/or α3 and/or 5 subunit relative to the al subunit are also encompassed within the scope of the present invention; such compounds will desirably exhibit functional selectivity in terms of zero or weak (positive or negative) efficacy at the 1 subunit and (i) a full or partial agonist profile at the D2 and/or 03 subunit, and/or (ii) an inverse agonist profile at the 5 subunit.<br>

Cognitive disorders for which the compounds of the present invention may be of benefit include delirium, dementia, amnestic disorders, and cognition deficits, including age-related memory deficits, due to traumatic injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease and Down Syndrome. Any of these conditions may be attributable to substance abuse or withdrawal. Examples of dementia include dementia of the Alzheimer's type with early or late onset, and vascular dementia, any of which may be uncomplicated or accompanied by delirium, delusions or depressed mood; and dementia due to HIV disease, head trauma, Parkinson's disease or Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.<br>
In order to elicit their behavioural effects, the compounds of the invention will ideally be brain-penetrant; in other words, these compounds will be capable of crossing the so-called "blood-brain barrier". Preferably, the compounds of the invention will be capable of exerting their beneficial therapeutic action following administration by the oral route.<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as com starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms<br><br>
such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Typical unit dosage forms contain from 1 to 100 mg, for example 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg, of the active ingredient. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
In the treatment of neurological disorders, a suitable dosage level is about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, and especially about 0.05 to 5 mg/kg per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>

Where the above-described processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The novel compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The novel compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques such as preparative HPLC, or the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-/7-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid, followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The novel compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.<br>
During any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned.<br><br>
This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3rd edition, 1999. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>

Assays are incubated for 1 hour at 40oC, then filtered using either a Tomtec or Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters followed by 3 x 3 ml washes with ice cold assay buffer. Filters are dried and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Expected values for total binding are 3000-4000 dpm for total counts and less than 200 dpm for non-specific binding if using liquid scintillation counting, or 1500-2000 dpm for total counts and less than 200 dpm for non-specific binding if counfing with meltilex solid scintillant. Binding parameters are determined by non-linear least squares regression analysis, from which the inhibition constant Ki can be calculated for each test compound.<br>
