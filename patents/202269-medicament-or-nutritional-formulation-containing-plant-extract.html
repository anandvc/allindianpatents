				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The most common metabolic bone disorder is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the reduction in the quantity of bone, either from the reduction in bone formation or the acceleration of bone resorption, in either event the result is a decrease in the amount of skeletal tissue. Osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells) are responsible for the excavation of a portion of bone during the resorption process. After resorption, osteoblasts (bone forming cells) appear, which then refill the resorbed portion with new bone.<br>
In young healthy adults, the rate at which the osteoclasts and osteoblasts are formed and operate maintains a balance between bone resorption and bone formation. However, as normal consequence of aging, an imbalance in this remodeling process develops, resulting in loss of bone. As imbalance continues over time, the reduction in bone mass and thus bone strength leads to fractures.<br>
Many compositions and methods are described in the medical literature for the treatment of osteoporosis. For example, estrogens, calcitonin and bisphosphonates are known to be effective inhibitors of bone resorption.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that products derived from certain plants or vegetables which belong for example to the botanical families of liliaceae, umbelliferae and cruciferae have a potent inhibitory effect on bone resorption.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of a vegetable extract or concentrate, excluding extracts or concentrates derived from leguminosae and hop, having an inhibitory effect on bone resorption in the preparation of a medicament or nutritional formulation for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition which is characterized by increased bone resorption, such as Paget"s disease, tumor-induced bone disease or particularly osteoporosis.<br><br>
By the term leguminosae is meant the botanical family leguminosae (pea family) which includes for example soybean, beans, chick pea or lentil. By hop is meant the botanical species Humulus lupulus.<br>
Osteoporosis as used herein includes osteoporosis induced by hormone deficiency (e.g. postmenopausal) and old age, as well as secondary osteoporosis such as osteoporosis secondary to steroid treatment or secondary to malnutrition caused by anorexia nervosa.<br>
The invention further provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition which is characterized by increased bone resorption, such as Paget"s disease, tumor-induced bone disease or particularly osteoporosis, comprising the administration of a medicament or nutritional formulation to a human or other mammal, said medicament or nutritional formulation comprising a vegetable extract or concentrate, excluding extracts or concentrates derived from leguminosae and hop, in an amount which is effective for inhibiting bone resorption.<br>
The present invention also foresees the use of an extract or concentrate from a plant selected from the group consisting of allium, petroselinum, brassica and eruca extracts and concentrates in the preparation of a medicament or nutritional formulation for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition which is characterized by increased bone resorption, such as Paget"s disease, tumor-induced bone disease or particularly osteoporosis.<br>

The use of a concentrate of the above-mentioned plants or vegetables in solid form and particularly in powder form is preferred.<br>
Suitable methods of obtaining extracts of the above-mentioned plants or vegetables are known in the art. The plant or vegetable extracts are obtainable e.g. by extracting the fresh-cut or dried plants or vegetables or the respective roots, fruits or seeds thereof for example with water or with one or more food grade solvents or with a mixture of water and one or more food grade solvents. Suitable food grade solvents include propane, butane, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethanol, carbon dioxide, acetone, nitrous oxide, methanol and propan-2-ol, whereby ethanol and carbon dioxide are preferred; ethanol is a particularly preferred food grade solvent. After the extraction step the liquid phase is optionally concentrated or dried by evaporation or freeze drying. The fresh-cut or dried plant or vegetable material may be introduced in cold or preferably hot water and/or solvent, preferably water or a mixture of water with one or more solvents, for a specified period of time, which may vary within wide ranges depending on the kind of plant or vegetable material or solvent used but commonly amounts for example to 1 to 30 minutes, preferably 2 to 15 minutes and most preferred 5 to 10 minutes for a water extraction and for example 30 to 90 minutes, preferably 60 minutes for an ethanol/water extraction. For a water extraction the temperature preferably lies in the range of 85 to 95°C and for an alcohol/water extraction the temperature preferably lies in the range of 55 to 65°C. For a carbon dioxide extraction, the extraction preferably takes place at 0 to 40°C and at super¬critical pressure (e.g. 80-200 bar). After the extraction the liquid phase is separated and advantageously concentrated or evaporated to dryness according to known methods. To obtain a concentrated extract two or more extraction steps as described above may be combined. Moreover, the plant or vegetable extracts may be obtained by introducing the fresh-cut or dried plant or vegetable in water and subjecting the mixture to a steam<br><br>

Suitable base materials are, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylenglycols or paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
The inhibitory effect on bone resorption of the inventive plant or vegetable extracts and concentrates may be assessed by measuring the urinary excretion of [^H]-tetracycline from chronically prelabled rats as described in R.C. Muhlbauer and H. Fleisch, Am J Physiol 258. R 679-R689 (1990). The method is based on the characteristics (i) that ^H-labeled tetracycline is deposited in hard tissues during their formation; and (ii) when bone is resorbed, f H]-tetracycline is released, circulates in blood, and is excreted into the urine where it can be assessed by counting ^H. This is probably due to the fact that [^H]-tetracycline from bone circulates in a form that binds poorly to hydroxyapatite and, therefore, [^H]-tetracycline once liberated from bone, is only poorly reutilized during bone turnover, and because of an efficient renal excretion. The method may be performed as follows: rats are injected subcutaneously twice a week with increasing volumes of a solution containing [^H]-tetracycline starting shortly after birth until the age of about six weeks. At the age of about 50 days, the animals are transferred to individual metabolic cages and every rat is fed with the same amount of a standardized diet for about the three weeks. After that, one group of rats is fed with a purified diet, and another group is fed with the purified diet containing in addition a certain amount of an inventive plant or vegetable concentrate or extract. During the experiments, the animals have free access to demineralized water.<br><br>
When the rats are about 60 days old, dally 24-hour urine collections are started, and the ^H contents in urine are determined by liquid scintillation counting. A diagram is then prepared wherein the [^H]-tetracycline contents in urine of the two groups of rats are plotted as a function of time (days).<br>
Suitable experiments show that the plant or vegetable extracts and concentrates of the Invention are capable of considerably decreasing the cumulative [^H]-tetracycline excretion in urine of intact males and castrated female rats which indicates a high inhibitory effect on bone resorption. Accordingly, the claimed nutritional and pharmaceutical compositions are useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of all kinds of diseases or conditions which are characterized by increased bone resorption, such as Paget"s disease, tumor-induced bone disease or particularly osteoporosis.<br>
The Inhibitory effect of the plant or vegetable extracts or concentrates on bone resorption may also be assessed by an in vitro assay (described in Example 3) In which Ivory slices, onto which freshly isolated osteoclasts have been settled, are incubated with a medium containing the extract or concentrate to be tested. The inhibitory effect on osteoclasts Is assessed by counting the osteoclast resorption pits on the ivory slice.<br>

Example 2: - Effect of HaO extracts of broccoli, dog-parsley and onion on bone resorption<br>
The effect of the inventive plant or vegetable extracts and concentrates on bone resorption is based on a method as described in R.C. Miihlbauer and H. Fleisch, Am J Physiol 259, R 679-R689 (1990). Bone resorption is monitored by the urinary excretion of ^H in Wistar rats prelabled from birth for 6 weeks with [^H]-tetracycline as described in the above-mentioned reference. The rats are then housed in Individual metabolic cages and are fed for 10 days with a standard laboratory chow (Kliba 331, Klingentalmuhle, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) containing 1.0 g Ca, 0.7 g P, and 80 lU of vitamin D3/IOO g of food. After this adaptation period, all rats received a diet containing 1.0 g Ca, 1.2 g P, and 80 ID of vitamin D3/IOO g dry weight. This was achieved by adding appropriate amounts of Ca-gluconate and neutral phosphate salts to a basic low calcium, low phosphate diet (Sodi 2134, Klingenthalmuhle, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) in powder form for another 10 days during which urine is collected. Then rats were "pair-fed" receiving 28g of wet food per day. One group (n=6) is switched to a purified diet ("Diet P", Sodi 2160, Klingenthalmuhle, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland given as wet food with a water content of 45 ± 2% containing 1.0 g Ca, 1.2 g P, and 80 lU of vitamin Da/IOOg dry weight), a second group (n=5) is fed with the purified diet containing<br><br>
in addition 300 mg extract from broccoli per day (corresponding to 1.0 gram of dry broccoli extracted for 10 minutes at 89 ± 3""C with 10 ml distilled water), a third group (n=5) is fed with the purified diet containing in addition 300 mg extract from Italian Parsley per day (corresponding to 1.0 gram of dry Italian Parsley extracted for 10 minutes at 89 + 3°C with 10 ml distilled water), and a fourth group (n=5) is fed with the purified diet containing in addition 550 mg extract from onion per day (corresponding to 1.0 gram of dry onion extracted for 10 minutes at 89 + 3°C with 10 ml distilled water).<br>
After 10 days adaptation without urine collection and a further 10 days with urine collection, the rats are allocated to the different treatment groups. Using the baseline 24 hour f H]-tetracycline excretion as selection criterion, special care is taken to obtain similar mean initial values for each group. Thereafter, the rats are switched to the purified diet with or without inventive extract and daily 24-hour urine collections are performed over a period of 14 days, and the cumulative [^H]-tetracyciine excretion in urine is determined by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
After 14 days of treatment the cumulative bone resorption was 9.2%, 9.5% and 17.5% (p
Example 3: - Effect of a bear"s garlic concentrate on bone resorption<br>
The same method as described in Example 2 is used except that treatment lasts only six days and the test group (n=5) is fed with the purified diet containing in addition 1 g of a concentrate from bear"s garlic (obtained by drying and grinding fresh bear"s garlic). It was found that bear"s garlic inhibits bone resorption in male rats by 13.5% (p
Example 4: - Effect of onion extract on in vitro resorption<br>
The effect of an onion extract on in vitro resorption is investigated on osteoclast-mediated resorption (as described in Arnett TR, Spowage M, 1996, Modulation of the resorptive activity of rat osteclasts by small changes in extracellular pH near the physiological range. Bone 18:277-279) with the following modifications: instead of using bone wafers, ivory<br><br>
slices are used as mineral substrate to assess osteoclast resorption pits which are counted under tangential illumination after gold spottering (Vltte C, Fleisch H, Guenther HL, 1996, Bisphosphonates induce osteoblasts to secrete an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated resorption, Endocrinology 137:2324-2333). In this assay one 4x4 millimeter ivory slice, onto which freshly isolated osteoclasts have been settled is incubated per well of a 48-well plate in 250 |xl of a medium containing the extract to be tested during 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% COa/air atmosphere. For each dose 8 slices are used. Osteoclasts are harvested from femurs of newborn rats which are, after removing the cartilagenous ends, split in half and chopped transversally. This procedure leads to a cell suspension rich in other cells such as osteoblasts. This permits to test effects in broad conditions, that is, as to both, direct effect on osteoclast and indirect effect on the osteoclast mediated by other cells such as osteoblasts.<br>
The onion extract is obtained by extracting a fine powder of onion for 10 minutes in distilled water (100g/l) at 90°C, filtrating and freeze-drying the filtrate, followed by a second extraction of the dry water extract for one hour at 60°C in 85% ethanol/15% water, cooling to room temperature, keeping over night at -20°C to allow precipitation of unwanted material, decanting the supernatant, evaporating the alcohol and freeze-drying the thus obtained residue, whereby 250 mg freeze-dried onion extract are obtained for each g of dry whole onion.<br>
The onion extract (0.017, 0.17, 1.7 mg onion extract/ml medium) inhibited osteoclast-mediated resorption of dentine in a dose-dependent manner, while the number of tartrate-resistant alcaline phosphatase positive (TRAP*) multinucleated cells (f^NC) did not decrease significantly. Thus, the ratio pits/ TRAP"^ MNC decreased significantly (p
