NOVEL COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to Swedish application number 0201544-4, filed on May 17, 2002, and U.S. provisional application 60/410,038, filed on September 12, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to processes for their preparation, as well as to the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament which particularly acts on the central nervous system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART Many disorders and conditions of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic, and the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. For example, serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) has been implicated in a number of disorders and conditions which originate in the central nervous system. A number of pharmacological and genetic experiments involving receptors for serotonin strongly implicate the 5-HT2c receptor subtype in the regulation of food intake, see for example Obes. Res. 1995.3, Suppl. 4,449S-462S and Drugs Future 2001. 26,383-393. The 5-HT2c receptor subtype is transcribed and expressed in hypothalamic structures assoC1ated with appetite regulation. It has been demonstrated that the 5-HT2c receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), which has some preference for the 5-HT2c receptor, reduces food intake in mice that express the nonmal 5-HT2c receptor while the compound lacks activity in mice expressing the mutated inactive form of the 5-HT2c receptor (Nature 1995. 374, 542-546). In a recent clinical study, a slight but sustained reduction in body weight was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment with mCPP in obese subjects (Psychopharmacology 1997. 133, 309-312). Recently, a series of pyrrolo[3,2,]-//]quinoline derivatives was identified to be 5-HT2c receptor agonists having selectivity over the 5-HT2a receptor<br><br>
(Isaac M., et.al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000.10, 919-921). The compounds are said to offer a novel approach to the treatment of obesity and epilepsy.<br>
■   Weight reduction has also been reported from clinical studies with other "serotonergic" agents (see e.g. IDrugs 1998. 1, 45^-470). For example, the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the, 5-HT releasing agent/reuptake inhibitor dexfenfluramine have exhibited weight reduction in controlled studies. However, currently available drugs that increase serotonergic transmission appear to have only a moderate and, in some cases, transient effects on the body weight.<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has also been suggested to be involved in CNS disorders such as depression and anxiety (Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 1998. 7, 1587-1599; IDrugs, 1999, 2, 109-120).<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has further been suggested to be involved in<br>
urinary disorders such as urinary incontinence (IDrugs, 1999. 2,109-120).<br>
Compounds which have an effect on the 5-HT2c receptor may therefore have<br>
a therapeutic potential in the treatment of disorders like those mentioned above.<br>

The group may be introduced or cleaved off by conventional methods such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.

The aqueous phase was washed twice with CHClj and the combined, dried (MgS04), organic phases were evaporated at reduced pressure to give a light yellow oil (1.75 g, 69%). A NOE between the methylene protons at C-2 in the piperazine ring and the C3-hydrogen in the pyridine ring was observed. Purity 99% (HPLC). Fragmenting MS analysis supports the stated structure.

General procedure<br>
Volumes are expressed as total volumes.<br>
To a 16 mm test tube was added;<br>
•	0.5 mmol of the appropriate alcohol or thiol<br>
•	0.4 mmol of the appropriate 6-chloro 5-trifluoromethyI-2-piperazinylpyridine in<br>
DMSO (0.5 mL)<br>
•	0.65 mmol of K-/-BuO in DMSO (1.0 mL)<br>
The reactions were stirred at room temperature for two hours followed by addition of HO Ac (1.25 mmol, 75 |j.L). The solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure over night (Speed Vac). The remaining solids were dissolved in water/acetonitrile/HOAc, filtered, and the products were purified with preparative HPLC.<br>
Mass detection was obtained by a Micro Mass LCP with electrospray positive ionization mode. The analytical HPLC-chromatograms were performed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 with a 50x4.6mm Grom-SEL 100 ODS 0 AB, 3 ^m column and a 50x4.6 mm YMC-AQ 5 fim column. Different gradients of 0.1% TEA in water and acetonitrile were used and the peaks were detected at 254 nm. The area% under the largest peak was reported as the purity.<br>

PREPARATION OF A PHARMACEUTIGAL COMPOSITION<br>
  I<br>
The active ingredient 1 is mixed with ingredients 2, 3, 4 and 5 for about 10 minutes. The magnesium stearate is then added, and the resultant mixture is mixed for about 5 minutes and compressed into tablet form with or without film-coating.<br>
PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
The ability of a compound of the invention to bind or act at speC1fic 5-HT receptor subtypes can be determined using in vitro and in vivo assays knpwn in the art. The biological activity of compounds prepared in the Examples was tested using different tests.<br>
Affinity assay<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor affinity of compounds in the Examples was determined<br>
in competition experiments, where the ability of each compound in serial dilution to displace 3H-labelledlabeled 5-HT, bound to membranes prepared from a transfected HEK293 cell line stably expressing the human 5-HT2c receptor protein, was monitored by SC1ntillation Proximity Assay technology. Non-speC1fic binding was defined using 5 \xM mianserin. Results obtained for exemplary compounds of the invention are illustrated in Table 1 below. The 5-HT2c receptor affinity values, expressed as percent inhibition of binding of the radioligand at 50 nM of test<br><br>
compound, were in the range of l0%-95%. The Kj values for the compounds towards the 5-HT2C receptor were in the range 0.5-5000 nM.<br><br>
Efficacy assay<br>
The agonist efficacy at the 5-HT2c receptor of the compounds in the<br>
Examples was determined by the ability of each compound to mobilise intracellular calC1um in transfected HEK293 cells, stably expressing the human 5-HT2c receptor<br>
protein, using the calC1um-chelating fluorescent dye FLUO-3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.).<br>
The maximum responses of the compounds in the Examples were in the range of 0-102% relative to the maximum response of 5-HT (serotonin) at a concentration of 1 µM.<br><br><br>
