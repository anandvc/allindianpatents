				<td>ing slant attachment of a mount on a circuit board.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor device which has a mount certainly secured on a circuit board correctly in the upright condition.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The semiconductor device according to the present invention includes a support, a mount secured on the support by brazing metal and a semiconductor element secured on the mount. The mount is formed with at least an inclined surface formed at the periphery which faces the support and a plurality of legs formed inside the inclined surface to form at least a dent between the legs. The inclined surface is divergent away from the support, and the legs are in contact with the support. The brazing metal is disposed in a gap including the dent and a flaring area between the support and the inclined surface of the mount between the support and mount.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the mount is formed into substantially rectangular shape to form four inclined surfaces, and the legs forms a cross dent inwardly extending from each inclined surface. The legs are formed into columns or elongated protrusions separated from each other, extending from the mount. The support includes a circuit board on which at least an electrode and circuit conductor are formed thereon for electrical connection.<br>
The method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention comprises the steps of: providing a mount formed with a plurality of integrally formed legs and at least an inclined surface formed at the periphery; piling in turn on an electrode fonncd on a support, an adhesive solder paste, the mount, an adhesive solder past and a semiconductor chip to form a subassembly; and heating the subassembly to re-fuse the solder pastes and then cooling same for full setting to simultaneously bond the mount and semiconductor chip on the support. Gas produced in brazing metal is released during the heating process through at least a dent formed between the legs and the inclined surface out of the brazing metal, thus preventing trapping of bubbles therein.<br>
The legs formed in the mount are effective to prevent slant attachment of the mount on the support with substantially uniform thickness of brazing metal between the support and<br>
mount. In addition, the mount is firmly bonded on the support by brazing metal filled in the dent between the legs and in the flaring area between the support and the inclined surface of the mount to prevent exfoliation or detachment of the mount from the support when the semiconductor device is used under severe variation of ambient temperature. As a result, the semiconductor device can keep good electric properties during its long duration and improve yield in manufacture. A plurality of legs separated from each other provide stable attachment of the mount against its inclined condition because gas produced in brazing metal is released through the dent out of the brazing metal, thus preventing trapping of bubbles therein and enhancement of braze strength.<br>
The above-mentioned as well as other objects of the present invention will become apparent during the course of the following detailed description and appended claims.<br>
