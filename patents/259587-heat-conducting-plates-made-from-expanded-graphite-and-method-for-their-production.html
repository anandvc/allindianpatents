method for their produc-ion<br>
Descrip::ion<br>
The present ir.vention relates to heat-conducting plates iT.ade frcrr. expanded graphite v;ithou:: binding agents wixih uxyLfcixi.'«d neau cOi.aUw(-ion paraj-^ei tc vne pia-s surface, and also to a method for their producuion. The heat-cond'ixcring plates in accordance with the invention are suitable inter alid.  for the transiTiission of heat of floor-, wall-^ ceiling- and other flatly arranged heating systems, air-conditioning ceilings. In addition to z:\zzz  ::pplicationc in building engineering. ::he heat-ccnducting plates in accordance v^ith the invention can be used for the transmission of hea~ and dissipation of heaz in motor cars, :-n machines and :.ns"caixacion3 and -:i i-^iupyx-ctvui.fc;-uuiiL-.<jllt for ekample preserving foodstuffs.></jllt>
Special heat-conducting heating layars are used in conjunction with floor-, wall- and ceriing-heating systems, in order to achieve pleasant room air conditions.  Conductive flooring plaster, building plaster and other heating layers chat contain additives nade from graphite in order to improve the heat conductivity are known from Patent Applications DE 196 22 788 A, DE 100 49 230 A and D3 198 02 230 A, DE 195 33 686 A, and DE 196 CO 228 A.<br>
In Patent Applications DE 41 17 077 A, DE 41 17 074 A and DS 40 167 10 it has been proposed that moulded bodies made from expanded graphite be used in the construction of floor-heating systems and other heating installations anc also in devices for sound-insulation and electromagnetic shielding.  These r.oulded bodies are produced in that either<br><br>
•	expandable graphite is incompletely expanded in a fluidized bed or already in the final ir.ould whilst subject CO a moderate heat supply and subsequently the expansion is broucrht to an end at an increased temperature in a mouldy or<br>
•	expandable graphite that has been incompletely expanded whilst subject to a ir.oderate heat supply is pressed in a mould to forr. a preforr.-i ar.d subsequently the ^expansion is brought to an end in the nould at a comparatively high temperature, or<br>
•	a moist preparation of expandable graphite is expanded in a mould whilst subject to a supply cf<br>
The final stage of the expansion is thus in each case<br><br>
-t<br>
the expansion there is no compacting.  The mould mus be designed in such a vay that on the one hand it is substantially closed so that the material takes on the desired geometry, but on the other hand it perrr.i-s the escape Ci. ci-Lr.  Tutt lU'oa-uu^U U'^0--L^^   -.-i'.at aue o^i/taAnec with this method are to be dimensionally stable and have homogeneous density.  In preferred variants of the above-mentioned methods, various aggregates and auxiliary substances, in particular binding agents/ are added to the expandable graphite,<br>
Since the expansion cf the expandable graphite that is uniformly distributed in the mould takes place in all directions in space in the method of production<br>

zhe  moulded bodies do not take on any distinct preferred orientation and the heat conductivity of these m.oulded bodies will therefore hardly be directicnally dependent.  For use in connection with flatly arranged heating elements, such as, for example,<br>
preferred heat conduction in plane is desirable in order to achieve raoid and uniform heat distribution over the surface.  Further dlsad^^antages of tha prior<br><br>
ar-c described above are the discontinuous method of production and the conparatively hic:h outlay for -he produccicn of the ventable moulds.<br>

The production of expanded graphite :expanded graphite material) is kno^^^n ir'-f^.r ^lis frcm US-A 5 404 061. To produce expanded graphi-e, graphite-intercaiat:ion<br>
hydrogen sulphate or graphite ni"rate, are heated in a shock-like manner.  Thereupon^ the volume of the graphite par::icles is increased by the factor 200 to 400 and the bulk density drops to 2 to 20 g/1.  The so-called expanded graphite material thus obcained consists of vermiform or concertina-shaped aggregates. Tf th^i completely expanded graphite is compac;:ed under the directional action of a pressure, the layer planes of the araobite are nv^fcav-,hlv ^rrpna^^d RO ^F^  tn b"?^<br>

example webs or plates, can be produced that are self-fpupporting without the addition of binders*  It is on this effect that is known from the production of graphite foils with a thickness of 0.15 to 3 min, used, for example, as semi-finished products for the production of flat seals, that the production and mode of functioning of the heat-conducting plates in accordance v;ith the invention are based.

In rhe figures:<br>

Figure 2      shows a cross section through a<br>

"igure 3      shows a plan vis^.v cf a heat-conducting<br>
plate in accordance vith the invention ;vith a heating spiral, enabedded therein.<br>
Typically, the hea~"Ccnductinc plates in accord^.nC'* v;ith the invention are between 3 an:. zO  ruin thick, l-'owGver, plate's having thicknesses between 2C and 40 rrxr. are particularly preferred.  Typical dimensions for v:all/ floor and ceiling elements us€:d in structural engineering lie between ICO x 60 and 2 00 x 100 crri.  The heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invenzicn are not, however, tied to these dinensrons*  The length and width can be selected in accordance with the intended application, since the production method does not set any narrow liir.its.  The density of the expanded graphite in the heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention lies in the range cf 0.01 to 0-5 g/ciu^ , preferably between 0.05 and 0.25 g/cir&gt; .  For use in structural engineering, the heat-conducting plates in accordance wiuh the invention therefore nieet the demands with respect to lightweight plates (bulk density 
The heat conductivity of the heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention in the direction parallel to the plate surface amounts to at least 5.5 W/ni-'^K and in the direction perpendicularly to the plate surface amounts to 3.6 w/in*K.  The heat conductivity parallel to the surface is thus at leasr 50% greater than perpendicularly to the surface.  The ratio of the heat conductivity parallel to the plate surface to the heat<br>
greater, the more intense the compression of the expanded graphite is, that is, the greater the density of the heat^-ccnducting plate is.<br>
The heat-conductinc olate in accordance with the invention can be used, for example, in conjunction with heating systems that utilise a fluid heat-carrier or<br><br>
ever, in conjunctior. v-ith el^c^rical heating sys-err.s, tipes  raade from ma-al^ for example copper, or plastics rr.aterial, for exa-'r.pla polypropylene or cress-linked i^v^-j^-^ V.*;.' -www, ^^^  ^^«^ . --W- _.. w_.o ..c.cz- ccn^,,-.c -ir.r; p_i _t in accordance v/ith rhe invention for -he transportation of a fluid heau-carrier, for example A-ater-  Pipss rr.ade from metal ars preferred on account cf the superior heat transfer.  A pips 2, for example, is embedded sc far in^-h(S heat-conducting plate 1 that it ends so thac it is flush vvith "he plate surface ^ Figure la) or is partly embedded rharein, that is, a portion of the circumference of the pips 2 projects cut from ths surface of the heat-conductinq plate 1 like a relief (Figure lb).  The space 3 around "he pipes projecting out of the plate surface is filled in vvith a suitable material, for example flooring plaster or ground graphite material to which flooring plaster is applied• Heating wires for electrical heating can be laid on chs plate surface or pressed into the plate surface. Alternatively, pipes 2 or heating elem.ents can also be laid bet^v'een two heat-conducting places 1 and 1' which are then pressed together (Figure Ic).  It has been shox^rn that such composite plax:e$ rr.ade from two heat-conducting plates of expanded graphite that have been pressed together are very stable; they cannot work J.OVH?^ d.yaxx'1 az wue oounciary suri.ace o— vne pxa"ces. Plates cf little thickness are preferably used for this variant in order to obtain a composite plate whose thickness only slightly exceeds the diamieter of the embedded pipe. A large distance between the plate surface and the heating element or pipe embedded in the plate is disadvantageous since the heat conduction in the heat-conducting plates in accordance wix:h the invention perpendicularly to the pla^e plane is less than that parallel to the plate plane.  The pipes or heating wires are arranged in such a way that they enable there to bs uniform distribution of the heat over the place surface, for example in a meander-shaped<br><br>
cr spiral pattern»  For this reason, the heating v;ires cf electrical heating systen^s are preferably arranged in a grid- or meander-shaped rr.annsr.  On account of the hiah level of heax: conductivity of the heat,-conductina plate in accordance v;it.h the invenzicn, -he heating pipes cr vvires on the surface thai is to be heated need not, however, form s-:.c:\  a dense grid system as "hat required in the c3-s
In their simplest embodiment, the heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention consist completely of expanded graphite.  Aggregates and auxiliary subsT:ances, in particular binding agents, are not required for the functioning and dim.ensional stability of the heat-conducting plates in accordance w^ith the invention.  However, the heat conductivity and the mechanical stabilitv of the olates in accordance with the invention can be increased by adding metal and/or carbon fibres to the starting material expanded graphite material.  The length of these fibres<br><br>
prsteraiDiy arr.ounts to u.k; to o na\.  me mass traction of the fibres preferably lies between 5 and 40%. A further er.bodiment of rhe hear-conducting place in accordance V7ith the invention is characterised in that the heat-conductinj places are completely or parrly impregnated with plasties material^/ for example resins or thermoplastics^ in order to increase the density and the resistance to r:.ech^.nical and other environmental effects.<br>
^alternatively or m addition, one or mors surfaces of the heat-conduccing plates can be provided partially or completely with coats of paint, coverings or ccatmgs that perform certain functions, such as Ir.ter  alia the improvement of the visual effect and facilitation of the handleability of the heat-conducting plates, fire-protection, efface as a watsr-^vapour barrier, improvement of the heat-insulation and sound-insulation and reduction in the susceptibility to shock. A covering, for example a layer of varnish, or a layer of plastics material on the plate surface preferably qives rise noc onlv to an imorcvement in che visual effect and the ease of handling, but also takes over or assists with certain functions in terms of building physics.  For example, an improvement in che electromagnetic shielding is achieved v/ith a metalliferous layer of varnish.  A reflective layer of varnish improves the radiation of heat into the adjacent space.  These functions are also performed by a co^ating v;ith a metal foil, for exam.ple alum.inium. foil-<br>
Heat-insulating coatings consist, for example^ of expanded polystyrene, polyurethane or glass wool or rock wool.  These are preferably provided on the surface of the heat-conducting plates that is remoce from the space to be heated in order to avoid heat losses.<br>
further suitabla materials for coating che hear-conducting place in accordance v/ith the invention with<br><br>
a further functional layer are non-vcven fabrics, and papars; weed vsnasrs, planar tsxtils inaterials (woven fabrics, layered fabrics, warp-"<nittad fabrics knizted and similar perforated sheers also films r.r m fron olastics material or xne these laminated composites are particularly advantageous because they perform additional functions in terrris of building physics above addition to heat conduction the m.echanical stability heat-conducting plate is by composi-e. end faces heat-conductincj plates preferably coated with suitable materials for example improving x effect reducing si shocv wood veneers plastics metal bands.></nittad>
For further use, ir. terms of structural enginesring, of the heat-conducting plate in accordance with the invention it is advantageous tc provide at least one surface partly or completely with a coating that enables there to be connection to other building materials.  Suitable coating materials for this are filler, building-plaster and flooring-plaster and also nortar and concrete masses-<br>
z:he  heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention made from expanded graphite are not restricted to the simple flat plate form-  The heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention contain, for example, structural elements, such as depressions, grooves or beads, knurls and diamond-shaped knurling or grained surfaces^ joints and openings and other partial def orm.ations.  Furthermore, it is possible to plug into the plates in accordance v;ith the invention pins, angle irons, hollow punches, hooks, anchors or other connecting elements that project from the plate surfaces or end faces and<br><br>
connection v;i-:h adjacent heat-conducting plates or other conponsnts.<br>
Complete coi'^-pcnents, preferably lightvreight components^ can also be prcducs^d from the heat-ccnducting plates in ^.ccordance with the invancion in conjunction v:ith standard materials pertaining to structural cjngineering.  These composite compcnen-s comprise at least 6ne heat-conducting plate in accordance with the invention and at least one further ccmponen-, for example wooden boards, gypsum plaster boards, bricks, pumice, lime sandstone, fireclay bricks, tiles, cellular concrete scenes or slabs, Liapor stones, cr clinker•<br>
For "Che production of the above-mentioned composites made from heat-conducting plates of expanded graphite and the above-mentioned laitiinates or building materials, either the heat-conducting plate or/and the other constituent of the composite is provided wii;h an adhesive or another means that effects the adhesion of the composite partners, for example filler or building plaster or mortar cr another binding agent, on the sjurface that is. to be connected to the other respective material.     Hov/ever, formv-locking connections between the individual constituents of the corr.posite are also possible, for example tongue-and-groove connections or snap connections/ such as, for example, resilient hooks-<br>
The heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention are produced in a continuous process that includes the following basic steps: (i) pre-ccnpression of the expanded graphite material with optional post-compression to form a web of the desired density and thickness and (ii) rev/or king processes, if applicable, for coating, shaping and producing material composites, The reworking processes are advantageously effected as far as possible in a continuous manner on the web and<br><br>
cnly as far as is necessary in a discontinuous mannsr ^ en the plates cut to length from th^sj v:eb.<br>
In che case of the known procedure for producing graphite foil, the expanded graphite particles are guided over a pre-compressor and pairs of rollers/ as a rule "wo pairs of rollers, wiih the expanded rr.aterial being conT:inucusly supplied to rhe pre-compresscr. Arranged between the pairs of rollers there are heating zones in which che ir.a-erial is heated.  The ternperarures in these heading regions are approximately 600*^0 and are used to displace the air cut of the material that is becoming denser.  The expanded graphite material both in the ore-compressor and in the pairs of rollers experiences a directional effect of pressure that gives rise to parallel orientation of the layer planes in the graphite particles-.  It is possible to obtain very thin foils (0.15 to 3 :w\  thick) with this method.<br>
Such sm.all thicknesses are not required for the heat-conducting plates in accordance with the invention.  It has been shown that webs with a distinct orientation of the layer planes of the graphite are already obtained from expanded graphite material with a bulk density in the region of 2.5 to 5 g/1 by means of pre-cornpression between textile bands, that is, without further compression by pairs of rollers,<br>
The webs can be processed further, for example<br>
impregnated or coated, with other materials, when coming<br>
directly out nf hh^ Dre-comoressor.<br>
If applicable, carbon or metal fibres are added to the<br>
c-zpondod material, used as the starting matf^r-i;»" .<br>
befujLci it is passed to the ^re-compressor.<br>
If a plate thickness of only 10 to 15 rrzn and/cr a high<br>
material density (around 0.5 g/cm^ ) is required,<br>
however, it is expedient to guide the graphite web,<br>
coming continuoucly from the pre-compressor, further<br><br>
'-^etv/ee^ one and/or tvc pair? cf rolle'^s - '■-^'^ ^^'^  0'?:^r.i ng betv;een -he pairs cf rollers also being possible thereby.  Advantageously, this rcllinc process is conbined with the appllcazicn cf cover layers of other planar materials, such as, for example, non-woven fabrics, and papers, planar textile materials (vcven fabrics, layered fabrics, v/arp-knitted fabrics, knitted fabrics and similar) and also filns or foils of plastics material or netal.<br>
In the following stage of "he method, which follows on either continuously or discontinuously, the graphite vjebs tha- are obtained fron the continuous pre-compression process with optional post-coir.pression or the plates that are cut or punched ou-^ of these webs are brought inro the desired forrr. for use.  This stage of the method cenerall^^ terrr.ed re'^^'O"^'*'"! ^f*T "^ *^ t"^?. following, includes a wide variety of processing processes, such as impregnation, coating, partial re-c^haping and/or compression cf the plates/webs in a cold-press rr.ethod, trironing, shaping by, for example, mechanically processing the webs/plates, eiTibedding heating pipes or wires and also the production of composite components consisting of the heat-conducting plates in accordance with nhs invention and common building materials.<br>
There is a wide variety of suitable methods available in accordance with the prior art fcr the production of impregnations and surface coalings.  Impregnation can be effected by, for example, using "ihe dipping, spraying or printing method, using -he vacuum method or using a combination cf vacuum and printing methods and also in a fluidized 'oBd.<br>
!By Che term coating all processes are understood here ■ihat are used no co^^er the surface of the plaze in accordance wirh the invention with a layer of a different material.  This material can not onlv be<br><br>
dissolved or dispersed in a fluid, cut can also be present in a pulverulent form and also as a planar laminate.  Such coatings can be produced by, for example, pain-ing, varnishing, spraying, laminating or rolling-on methods, in which case in "hese methods, in contrast with zhe impregnaticn rr.ethcd, complete saturation of the incarior of the plaze in accordance v:ith the inven-ion does not -ake place.  In a special embodiment of nhe invention the componeni:s are covered with a plastics melt.  This takes place, for example, in a tempered fluidized bed, in an extrusion process or, if the plate size permits it, even in an injection-moulding process.<br>
Composites formed between the heat-conducting plates in c.ccordance with the invention and other laminates, such as paper webs, films, netal sheets, wood veneers, non-vfover.  iabrics or planar textile formations or semifinished building products, such as polystyrene and<br>
•wooden boards, gypsum plaster boards, fireclay bricks, bricks, lime sandstone, oumice, tiles, cellular concrete stones or slabs or Liaoor stones, are produced by applying adhesives, binding agents, fillers, mortar and building plaster to one or both of the surfaces that are to be connected together or by constructing a form-locking connection between the materials, for example a tongue-and-groove connection or snap connections, such as resilient hooks. By means of cold-^press methods the graphite webs can again be shaped and compressed over their whole surface or partially by means of pairs of rollers or axscontinuoui^ly bv iu«c.:iG u- ^j-ei-tscs.  Dy ui^cLiis? wl embossing rollers shaping can be carried out at the sam.e time for compression purposes, for example to produce grooves or beads, knurls and diamond-shaped knurling or grained surfaces.  This can take place both before and after the application of cover layers.<br><br>
Suitable methods for producing grooves, join-s or openings are, for example, cutting, punching, embossing, milling, turning and planing-  A particularly preferred n\e"hcd of mechanical processing is water-jez cutting. Alternatively; abrasive particle ~ez^   (sand blasts, spherules of fro2:en CO2) or laser beams can be used for processing.<br>
If applicable, functional corp.ponenzs, such as pipes for the distribution of a heat-carrier or heating wires, are also inuroduced at the reworking stage. Alrernatively, this can also take place directly in situ a- the construction site.<br>
Fleworking is effected discontinucusly in particular if coatings are produced from materials or composites with materials that are not available as rolled products, but only as plane products, for exanple metal sheets or plate products made from cardboard, gypsum and wood. The discontinuous procedure is also necessary if such surfaces that do not yet exist at all in the web obtained directly after compression,, such as the end faces of the plates that first develop when cutting the webs/cutting the plates to length, have to be coated or processed in another way.  Furthermore, discontinuous reworking allows the work sequences to be separated in time and space.<br>
Exemplary embodiment 1<br>
A v;eb having a thickness of 25 mm. was produced by continuously compressing pulverulent expanded graphite material between two textile bands.  A sample that had a length and a width of in each case 30 cm was cut out from this web and the density of this sample was determined.  A value of 0-027 g/om^ v;as ascertained. Moreover, the specific heat conductivity and the 3pecific electrical resistance of the sample were meas-jred in the x-, y- and z-direction.  The results are compiled in Table 1.<br><br><br>
tjoth che slec-rical and the heat conductivity have distinct anisctropy.  The ccnductior. of heat and ^ilectrical current is preferably efreotsd parallel to the plate surface, thaz is, along the graphite layer planes.<br>

The laminated ccmposii:e comprises an 18 iTwm thick moulded fibre board 4, a ? mrr. thick heat-conducting plate 1 made from compressed ez^panded graphite material and a 1 mm. chick perforated sheet 5. "he moulded fibre board 4 on the rear side of the heat-conducting plate is used for hea"-insulation, the perforated sheet 5 on the fronr side being used to improve the visual effect.  The moulded fibre board and heat-conducting plate were bonded together.  The perforated sheet embraces the laminated composite on the longitudinal sides and is held fast by means of longitudinal slots 5, 6' in th.e moulded fibre board 4. This laminated composite is sui-able, for example, for the construction of an air-condi-cioning ceiling. Embedded in the surface of the heat-conducting plate 1 "hac is remote frorr. -he m.oulded fibre board 4 there is a pipe that is v;cund in the form of an Archimedean spiral 7 (called heating spiral 7 in the followinc),<br><br>
has a dianeter of 6 mm and is rr.ade from plastics naterial, zhe pipe being erafcedded in such a v/ay chat it ends so that it is flush v/ith the plate surface.  The diameter of the outerrriosi: winding of the spiral c-mounted to 21 CITL.  The spiral 7 was positioned eubstan-ially in the centre of the plate 1; that is, the distance of the outerir.cst ^^^indinc of the spiral "^ to the righu-hand edge of zhs plate 1 v;as approxirr.ately as great as "o the left-hand edge of -he plate 1, and the distance of the outerrr.ost winding of "he spiral zo the upper edge of the plate 1 was approximately as great as ro the lower edge of zhe plate 1.  Figure 3 shows this heat-ccnduc'ing plare 1 in a plan view with zhe heating spiral 7 eap.bedded rhsrein.  For comparison purposes, a laminated composite of ::he sane dimensions v;as produced that contained, instead cf the heat-conducting plate in accordance v/ith the invention, a gypsum plaster board with three heating spirals Esmbedded therein next zo one ancther and of the same size as the heating spiral installed in the graphine plate.  Hot water at a temperature of 50*^0 flowed through the heating spirals in both test arrangements, "he change in the temperature distribution on the surfaces of both plates as a function of the duration of the through-flow cf hot water was tracked by means of infrared thermography. At the beginning of the test, both surfaces had a temperature of 25°C; temperature gradients over the surface could not be identified-  The further time characteristics of the change in temperature of the plates in the region surrounded by the heating spiral and in the periphery thereof can be seen in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Clearly rr.ore rapid heating ar.d mere uniform te^iperatur* distribution are achieved in ths test arrangement v;ith r.h® heat-conducting pla'::e in accordance with ths invention, owing 1.0 the high laceral heat ccnducuivity of the expanded graphite, with just one heating spiral in contrast with the tast arrangement with a conventional gypsum plate and three heating spirals.<br><br>
