				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A SATURATED CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a saturated carboxylic acid ester. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the conversion of olefins of the general formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula I<br>
wherein. RI is aryl, substituted aryl, naphthyl or substituted naphthyl or alkyl, R2, R3} and R4 are independently hydrogen or alkyl, to an ester of the corresponding saturated carboxylic acid of the general formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula II<br>
wherein, R is alkyl or aryl, RI is aryl, substituted aryl, naphthyl or substituted naphthyl or alkyl, R2, R3, R4 and RS are independently hydrogen or alkyl, using a supported aqueous phase palladium complex catalyst. Background of the invention<br>
Aryl and aliphatic saturated carboxylic acid esters have a variety of applications in industries as, anti-inflammatory drugs, fine chemicals etc. The prior art describe catalyst systems for employment in processes for the preparation of esters of carboxylic acids by the alkoxy carbonylation of corresponding olefins. The best known of such catalysts are homogeneous palladium catalysts. In general, the catalyst systems used for the alkoxycarbonylation of olefins contain a palladium source, a phosphine ligand and a hydrogen halide promoter. Alkoxycarbonylation of olefins using a catalyst system<br>
comprising PdCl2 or PdCl2(PPh3)2, excess triphenyiphosphine and HC1   has been found to occur only at drastic conditions such as 300-700 atm of CO pressure (Bittler et. al., Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed., 7, 1968, 329). Oi et. al. (J. Mol. Cat. A: Chem., 115, 1997. 289) have reported hydroesterification of styrene using cationic  palladium complexes and  which proceeds under mild conditions (20atm, 80°C) to give 91-94 % product yeild in four hours (TOF= 11 h ') with n: iso ratio of 60:40. Recently Seayad et al, (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 37, 1998, 2180, J. Mol. Catal. A: Chem.. 151, 2000. 47-59) have shown enhanced reaction rates in the hydroesterification of styrene (TOP = 411 h ') using a catalyst system comprising of Pd(OAc)2, PPh? and p-toluene sulphonic acid with an n:iso ratio of 35:64.   A  major disadvantage of these homogeneous catalytic processes was the difficulty in separation of the catalyst from the product and its recycle. An important method for heterogenizing such homogeneous catalysts is the application of two-phase systems comprising an aqueous phase containing water-soluble organometallic catalysts and a water immiscible phase (U.S. 31812, Kuntz EG CHEMTECH 17, 1987, 570; EP 0107006; B. Cornils, W. A. Herrmann (Eds.), Aqueous-Phase Organometallic Catalysis,  Wiley-VCH,   1998,  Weinheim).   In this case, separation of the organometallic catalyst from the organic reactants and products is greatly simplified due to the insolubility of the catalyst in water immiscible phase.<br>
Supported Aqueous Phase Catalysis (SAPC) (US 5736980, US 5935892) is another method to heterogenize homogeneous catalysts. Here, the catalytic material consists of a thin film of water containing a metal complex catalyst spread over a high-surface-area inorganic support, such as silica. The molecular catalyst is immobilized via the solvent i.e. water, reactants and products being in the organic phase. The main advantages of the SAP catalysts are easy catalyst recovery and good activity because of the high interfacial area, a property particularly sensitive with sparingly water-soluble reactants (J.P. Arhancet, ME. Davis, J.S. Merola. Be. Hanson, Nature, 339, 1989, 454; K.T. Wan, M.E. Davis, Nature, 370, 1994, 449; K.T. Wan, M.E. Davis, J. Catal., 148, 1994, 1). Objects of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide an improved process for the preparation of carboxylic acid esters by the alkoxycarbonylation of corresponding olefins using supported aqueous phase palladium complex catalysts.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a saturated carboxylic acid ester that overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art enumerated above.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a<br>
carboxylic acid ester that results in good yield and selectivity to carboxylic acid esters.<br>
It is a further oject of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a carboxylic acid ester that provides simple and efficient catalyst separation and recycle.<br>
It is observed in the invention that the use of supported aqueous phase palladium complex catalysts provide an improved catalyst for the carbonylation of olefins to corresponding saturated carboxylic acid esters. The use of such a catalyst gives good yields of carboxylic acid esters under mild reaction conditions with easy separation and reuse of the catalyst. Summary of the invention<br>
