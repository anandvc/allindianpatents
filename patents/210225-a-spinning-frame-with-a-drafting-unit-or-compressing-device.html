The invention relates to a spinning frame with a drafting unit or   compressing deviceâ€¢<br>
On spinning frames, on ring spinning frames with compression devices in particular, transverse fibres can develop between the threads running next to each other and which are being led to twisting devices, such transverse fibres can disturb the spinning process. The German patent application DE 195 00 036.6 describes a suction device for a state of the art spinning frame at which fibres, interconnecting several threads, are to be cut by means of a separating plate. Behind the separating plate, a suction tube is placed which is being arranged across the spacing of the two threads.<br>
It is the object of the invention to improve a spinning frame at the outlet of a drafting unitor of a compressing device respectively in such a way, that transverse interconnections in the form of fibres between the threads can be better caught and reliably separated. Furthermore the suction effect is to be improved and at the same time the air volume of the suctioned air is to be reduced.<br>
Said task is being solved with a suction device according to the characteristic features of the independent claim.<br>
In a spinning frame with a ring-traveller-twisting device a thread balloon develops while the traveller on the ring rotates around a spindle, a cop respectively, whereat said balloon can extend into a second thread balloon in upstream direction of the material flow away from a thread guide being arranged above the spindle. This second thread balloon can form itself as far as up to a drafting unit from which the material is being led to the spinning unit.<br><br>
For the operators of a spinning frame this can lead to difficulties since the thread being led from the drafting device to the spinning unit in this case is hardly visible, thus the condition of the spinning unit cannot be judged clearly. A thread break on a spinning unit can therefore perhaps not be recognized easily enough.<br>
It is further the object of the present invention, to provide a spinning frame as described, that no secondary balloons can develop.<br>
The depending claims relate to preferable further embodiments, in particular also features of devices which improve the visibility of the running threads, in that second balloons are being avoided.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning frame with a drafting unit or compressing device, wherefrom at least two threads each are delivered from or lead at a small distance to each other, characterized in that, a suction device is being positioned between two threads.<br><br>
In the following the invention is being described in detail according to the drawings, wherein show:<br>
fig. 1	a schematic illustration of a ring spinning frame with a double thread<br>
guide.<br>
fig. 2	a plan view of a double thread guide in the direction of the flow of the<br>
material<br>
fig. 3	a side view of a suction device according to the invention with a thread<br>
guide and<br>
fig. 4	an illustration of a suction device seen in the direction of the arrow in<br>
figure 3.<br>
In the upper section of a frame 10 of the spinning frame according to figure 1 a drafting unit 12 is being arranged amongst other devices, below it are the thread guide elements 20,25 which guide a thread 11 to a spinning unit 13. On a guide 14 a<br><br>
rail 18 is mounted shiftably together with a first thread guide 20 each for one spinning unit, and an additional second thread guide 25. Furthermore on the guide 14 there is a ring rail holder 16 mounted, which holds a ring rail 17 which again carries the ring-traveller-system 17a, by means of which the thread 11 is being wound onto a spindle<br>
19.	The thread 11 being led from the drafting unit 12 first runs through the second<br>
thread guide 25 which is being positioned at a distance from the first thread guide<br>
20,	before said thread is being guided downward thereby forming a balloon between<br>
the first thread guide 20 and the ring-traveller-system 17a. In the exemplified<br>
embodiment the double thread guide is being formed from a wire, which from its<br>
lower side toward its upper side at first, in the area of a holder 21, as shown in figure<br>
2 and 1 respectively, transforms into an eyelet 22, which as a winding of a spiral<br>
transforms into a first leg 23. From the first leg 23 a further leg 24 leads slantedly<br>
upwards, that is opposite to the thread running direction, whereat two guiding parts<br>
25a and 25b of the second thread guide 25 follow, which are arranged towards each<br>
other in respective opposite positioned obtuse angles. Said second thread guide 25<br>
is to be formed in such a way that the thread 11 between the drafting unit 12 and the<br>
first yarn guide 20 is slightly being diverted, whereat it is supported in the area<br>
between the first guide part 25a and the second guide part 25b. Since the thread has<br>
a certain play within the eyelet 22, the rotational movement of the thread section<br>
within the range of the first yarn guide 20 tends to continue in upward direction,<br>
which however fails in so far as the thread 11 due to the slight diversion by means of<br>
the second thread guide 25 is being stopped within the range between the thread<br>
guide part 25a and 25b. This results in the fact that the thread section between the<br>
drafting unit 12 and the second thread guide 25 practically does not make any<br>
transverse movement and thus it can be monitored by the operator without any<br>
difficulties.<br>
A further advantage is given in that due to the lack of transverse movements of the thread 11 running from the drafting unit 12 the spinning triangle being positioned at<br><br>
the outlet of the drafting unit and thus the start of twisting of the fibre strand into the thread 11 is not being impaired. Therefore the yarn quality can be improved.<br>
At least the section where the thread runs through the thread guide 20, that is for instance the eyelet 22, can be coated with ceramic or be provided with a ceramic insert.<br>
The improved suction device 40 according to the invention is being provided with a suction head 42, which is being provided with a suction opening 44 at a clamping gap between the two rollers at the outlet side of a drafting unit or of a compressing device respectively. In the exemplified embodiment in figure 3 a suction head is being arranged below the clamping point, the clamping line respectively between a compressing element 32 and a roller as part of a compressing device 30 being pressed against said compressing element 22, in such a way, that the suction head 42 according to figure 4 is being positioned between two threads 50A and 506. In the projection, in longitudinal direction of the spinning frame according to figure 3 a thread 50 includes an acute angle with a plane of the suction opening 44, that is on the right outer side of the spinning frame. Alongside of the suction head 42 extends a rib 46, whose upper edge together with the plane of the suction opening 44 includes an obtuse angle. This angle preferably measures between 100Â° and 120Â°. In case that there are transverse fibre connections are being formed between the threads 50A and 50B, they first hit the suction opening 44 according to figure 3 when the threads 50a, b are being led downward and thereafter they slide more or less far along the suction opening into the direction of the rib 56. If the transverse connections or transverse fibres are not separated immediately after they hit the suction opening 44, they will be stretched more and more, after hitting the wedge portion between the edge of the suction opening 44 and the upper edge of the rib 46, until they break. This way it is avoided that transverse fibres are led further into the direction of the twisting device, whereby the winding process could be disturbed or be interrupted respectively. Within the lower range of the suction head 42 a yarn<br><br>
guide 25 is being arranged which as mentioned above has the function to avoid a secondary balloon or such secondary balloons respectively of the threads 50A and 50B during winding. In the most simple case the thread guide 25 according to figure 4 consists of a straight rod which is being fastened to the suction device 40. The suction device 40 is adjustably mounted onto a holder 48, whereat the possibility for adjustment guarantees that the suction opening can be arranged as close as possible towards the clamping point between the compressing element 32 and the roller 34, without colliding with the compressing element 32 in the range of the rib 46. The compressing device is preferably a perforated drum with suction devices furnished inside of it. As indicated in figure 4 the thread guide 25 can either be a prismatic rod which is being arranged in the longitudinal direction of the spinning frame, or, as indicated by dotted line it can have a bent form, whereby an exactly defined position of the thread 50A or 50B respectively is being guaranteed. A second roller 36 rests on the compressing element 32, whereby said two elements 32 and 36 make up the outlet rollers of the drafting unit.<br><br><br><br>
