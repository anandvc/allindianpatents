TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention involves a two-stage complete recycle pressure-swing adsorption process for gas<br>
separation using two-stage pressure swing adsorption gas separation technology. It belongs to the field of<br>
pressure swing adsorption gas separation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that the former pressure swing gas separation technology usually has the following<br>
disadvantage whether obtaining the product from the strongly adsorbed phase (e.g. this technology has<br>
been employed to produce pure carbon dioxide from the strongly adsorbed phase.) or obtaining the<br>
product from the weakly adsorbed phase(e.g. this technology has been employed to produce pure<br>
hydrogen from the weakly adsorbed phase) or obtaining the product from both of the weakly adsorbed and<br>
the strongly adsorbed phase.(e.g. this technology has been also applied in the production of carbamide<br>
from synthetic ammonia shift gas by removing carbon). These kinds of the patents include CN1235862A,<br>
CN1248482A, CN1357404A CN1347747A, CN1342509A, CN1334135A and CN1334136A, etc.<br>
However it has been seen that the conventional pressure-swing gas adsorption technology possesses<br>
significant disadvantages in terms of the lost of the effective gases and the high operation cost, etc. The<br>
present invention involves improvements based on the pressure-swing adsorption gas separation<br>
technology mentioned above, namely, in this invention there is almost no lost of the effective gas, and in<br>
addition, this invention does not need the complicated vacuum facilities under suitable adsorption pressure.<br>
Therefore, the cost of the equipment and the power consumption will be remarkably reduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention adopts the two-stage pressure swing adsorption process to separate the strongly<br>
adsorbed and the weakly adsorbed component from the gas mixture, and the product may be the strongly<br>
adsorbed component or the weakly adsorbed component or both of them at the same time. In the present<br>
invention, the strongly adsorbed and the weakly adsorbed is relative and isn't absolute, that means that the<br>
same component is the strongly adsorbed component in one gas mixture, but it is the weakly adsorbed<br>
component in another gas mixture. In order to achieve different goals, the same component even if in the<br>
same gas mixture may be the strongly adsorbed component or may be the weakly adsorbed component;<br>
moreover, the strongly adsorbed component and the weakly adsorbed component in the invention may be<br>
a single component or may be sum of several components. For example, in the synthetic ammonia shift<br>
gas, it contains hydrogen sulfide, organic sulphur, gaseous water, carbon dioxide, methane, carbon<br>
monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, argon and hydrogen, etc. When this mixture is utilized to produce carbamide,<br>
the hydrogen sulfide, the organic sulphur, the gaseous water, and the carbon dioxide are called strongly<br><br>
adsorbed components; the methane, the carbon monoxide, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the argon and the<br>
hydrogen are called the weakly adsorbed components. When this mixture is utilized to produce the high<br>
pure hydrogen(99.99v%), the hydrogen sulfide, the organic sulphur, the gaseous water, the carbon dioxide,<br>
the methane, the carbon monoxide, the nitrogen, the oxygen and the argon are called strongly adsorbed<br>
components , but the hydrogen is called the weakly adsorbed component. Here in the above statement, the<br>
nitrogen in the synthetic ammonia shift gas is called weakly adsorbed component when it is utilized to<br>
produce carbamide , but it is called strongly adsorbed component when it is utilized to produce high pure<br>
hydrogen(99.99v%). The methane, the carbon monoxide, the nitrogen, the oxygen are the same too.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a kind of gas Separation process which has low investment<br>
and lower operation cost using two-stage complete recycle pressure swing adsorption. The process can<br>
overcome the disadvantages of the prior art by adopting the combination of different equipments and<br>
adsorbents, and can save the operation cost largely and reduce the effective gas loss at maximum extent<br>
comparing with the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The gas mixture in the present invention may be synthetic ammonia shift gas, synthetic ammonia deflating<br>
gas, synthesis gas, water gas, natural gas, semi water gas, high temperature furnace gas, gas, cracking dry<br>
gas, oilfield associated gas and oil making gas and so on, also may be any other gas mixture.<br>
The present invention adopts two-stage complete recycle pressure swing adsorption process for gas<br>
separation. The process is used to separate the strongly adsorbed component and the weakly adsorbed<br>
component from the gas mixture; the product can be the strongly adsorbed component or the weakly<br>
adsorbed component or both of them at the same time; the process adopts two-stage pressure-swing<br>
adsorption device operating in series; the gas mixture is fed into the first stage pressure-swing adsorption<br>
device, and the strongly adsorbed component of the gas mixture is adsorbed and is concentrated as<br>
product; the interim gas mixture from the outlet of the adsorption tower of the first stage pressure-swing<br>
adsorption device is fed into the second stage pressure-swing adsorption device; the strongly adsorbed<br>
component in the interim gas mixture is adsorbed further, and the nonadsorbed weakly adsorbed<br>
component acts as product and is fed into next step; all of the gas excepting for the weakly adsorbed<br>
component entering into next step in the second stage is returned into the first stage to increase the<br>
pressure of the adsorption tower; the average concentration of the strongly adsorbed components in outlet<br>
gas of the adsorption tower of the first stage is over or equal to 2 v % generally. The adsorption towers of<br>
the second stage are used to adsorb the strongly adsorbed components in outlet gas of the adsorption<br>
tower of the first stage to the desired level of the next step. Each adsorption tower of the two-stage<br>
pressure swing adsorption device goes through the steps in turn in one cycle as follows:<br>
The first stage:<br>
(1) Adsorption A<br>
Part of strongly adsorbed component is adsorbed by the adsorbent in the adsorption tower after the gas<br>
mixture is introduced to the inlet of the adsorption tower which is in the adsorption step; nonadsorbed<br>
weakly adsorbed component and part of strongly adsorbed component discharged from the outlet go into<br>
the adsorption tower of the second stage which is in the adsorption step. The total amount of adsorbed<br>
strongly adsorbed components will increase continuously with the increase of time the feed of gas is<br>
stopped when the adsorbed component mentioned above reach to the saturation on adsorbent, it means<br>
that the adsorption step is finished.<br>
(2)Cocurrent Equalization Depressurization ED<br>
The weakly adsorbed component concentration of the dead-space gas inside adsorption tower is rather<br>
high after finishing the adsorption step, this stream of the weakly adsorbed component need to be<br>
recovered and reused. The dead-space gas discharged at different times from the outlet of the adsorption<br>
tower enters into the adsorption tower which has completed the evacuation step VC to increase the<br>
pressure. The gas is discharged every time and pressure equalization is performed once. The strongly<br>
adsorbed component concentration at outlet of the adsorption tower increases continuously with the<br>
increase of the pressure equalization times. The pressure equalization times is determined by the<br><br><br>
adsorption pressure and the strongly' adsorbed component concentration at the outlet of the adsorption<br>
tower after the adsorption step. In general, the strongly adsorbed component concentration at the top of<br>
the adsorption tower ought to be over 30v%, better over 75v% after the last cocurrent equalization<br>
depressurization step ED.<br>
(3)Two-end Equalization Depressurization 2ED<br>
The weakly adsorbed component concentration of the dead-space gas inside adsorption tower is rather<br>
high and the strongly adsorbed component concentration is relative lower after finishing the adsorption<br>
step; on the one hand this part weakly adsorbed component need to be recovered and reused, on the other<br>
hand the strongly adsorbed component concentration need to be increased, therefore, the gas inside the<br>
absorption tower must be discharged to perform the depressurization desorption. The dead-space gas<br>
discharged at different times from the outlet of the adsorption tower enters into the adsorption tower which<br>
has completed the first stage regeneration step to pressurize. The gas is discharged every time and the<br>
pressure equalization is performed once. The strongly adsorbed component concentration at the inlet and<br>
the outlet of the adsorption tower increases continuously with the increase of the equalization<br>
repressurization times, at the same time, the weakly adsorbed component is recovered and reused. Every<br>
time the equalization depressurization operation mentioned above is performed, it may be operated at the<br>
two ends of the adsorption tower at the same time, or it may begin with the cocurrent equalization<br>
depressurization from the top of the adsorption tower at first, and then do with the backward equalization<br>
depressurization to another adsorption tower at the latter time prior to achieving the cocurrent equalization<br>
depressurization balance, the goal is to increase the concentration of the strongly adsorbed component and<br>
to recover the weakly adsorbed component inside the adsorption tower; the third way is to perform the<br>
cocurrent equalization depressurization at first, and then to stop it before the balance of the pressure<br>
between two adsorption tower, and then to perform the backward equalization depressurization. The first<br>
way can increase the adsorbent's efficiency. The amount of gas discharged from the bottom of the<br>
adsorption tower ought to be less than the amount discharged from the top of the adsorption tower while<br>
performing the two-end equalization depressurization. The two-end equalization depressurization<br>
step2ED' in the present invention is different from the usual equalization depressurization step ED the gas<br>
is discharged from the outlet of the adsorption tower at the usual equalization depressurization step ED, as<br>
to the said the cocurrent equalization depressurization, however, the gas is discharged from both the inlet<br>
and the outlet of the adsorption tower in the two-end pressure equalization depressurization 2ED' step in<br>
the present invention.<br>
After the adsorption step A of the adsorption tower, the first several pressure equalization operation may<br>
use cocurrent equalization depressurization ED, but latter several times pressure equalization or the last<br>
pressure equalization adopts the two-end equalization depressurization 2ED'. The concentration of the<br>
strongly adsorbed component in product still meet the production requirement after the equalization<br>
depressurization.<br>
The pressure equalization times is determined by the adsorption pressure and the concentration of the<br>
strongly adsorbed component at the outlet of the adsorption tower after the adsorption step. In ordinary<br><br><br>
circumstances, after the last two-end' equalization depressurization step 2ED' . The concentration of the<br>
strongly adsorbed component at top of the adsorption tower ought to be over 30v%, better over 75v%.<br>
The concentration of the strongly adsorbed component at bottom of the adsorption tower ought to be over<br>
30v%, better over 80v%.<br>
(4)Backward Depressurization BD<br>
After the two-end equalization depressurization step 2ED\ the strongly adsorbed component inside the<br>
adsorption tower is introduced into the next stage till to balance with the pressure of the next stage ; the<br>
strongly adsorbed component can be as product or as fuel or venting.<br>
(5)First Backward Depressurization Step BDl<br>
After the cocurrent equalization depressurization step ED, the weakly adsorbed component at the bottom<br>
inside the adsorption tower is discharged into the buffer vessel at first, and then the gas is introduced<br>
inside the buffer vessel into the adsorption tower to pressurize; in ordinary circumstances, after the first<br>
backward depressurization step BDl, the concentration of the strongly adsorbed component at bottom of<br>
the adsorption tower ought to be over 30v%, better over 80v%.<br>
(6) Second Backward Depressurization Step BD2<br>
After the second backward depressurization step BDl, the strongly adsorbed component inside the<br>
adsorption tower is introduced into the next stage till to balance with the pressure of the next stage; the<br>
strongly adsorbed component can be as product or as fuel or venting.<br>
(7)Evacuation VC<br>
After the backward depressurization step BD, the strongly adsorbed component adsorbed on adsorbent<br>
pulled by vacuum pump from the bottom of the adsorption tower is introduced into the next stage. After<br>
the backward depressurization step BD, the purge step P is performed if the evacuation step VC is not<br>
performed; the dried strongly adsorbed component or another dry gas inside the system can be as purge<br>
gas. This step is adopted when the adsorbent amount need to be decreased.<br>
(8)First Stage Gas Repressurization 2ER1<br>
After the backward depressurization step BD or evacuation step VC, the gas discharged from the<br>
adsorption tower of the first stage in the first backward depressurization stepBDl is returned to the outlet<br>
of the adsorption tower of the first stage to pressurize the adsorption tower which has finished the<br>
backward depressurization step BD or the evacuation step VC. The added step can increase the recovery<br>
of the effective gas.<br>
(9)Second Stage Gas Repressurization 2ER<br>
After the backward depressurization step BD or evacuation step VC or the first stage gas repressurization<br>
step2ERl, in second stage, other gas excepting the weakly adsorbed component entering into the next<br>
stage is returned into the outlet of the adsorption tower of the first stage to pressurize the adsorption tower<br>
which has finished the backward depressurization step BD or the evacuation step VC. The added step can<br>
increase the recovery of the effective gas.<br>
(10) Two-End Equalization Repressurization 2ER'<br>
After the second stage gas repressurization step 2ER, the gas discharged from the two-end equalization<br><br><br>
depressurization step 2ED' in first stage is introduced into the adsorption tower from the inlet and the<br>
outlet to pressurize the adsorption tower gradually. The times of the two-end equalization repressurization<br>
step 2ER' and the times of the two-end equalization depressurization step 2ED' are the same. Every time<br>
the gas used for the two-end equalization repressurization step2ER' comes from the gas of the two-end<br>
depressurization step 2ED' of the different adsorption tower. The two-end equalization repressurization<br>
step 2ER' in first stage is different from the usual equalization repressurization step ER, the gas<br>
discharged from the usual equalization repressurization step ER is introduced at the outlet, however ,the<br>
gas discharged from the two-end equalization repressurization step 2ER' in first stage is entered at both<br>
the inlet and the outlet.<br>
After the adsorption step A, while performing the cocurrent equalization depressurization step ED for the<br>
first several times, the gas discharged from the equalization repressurization step ER of the adsorption<br>
tower enter into the adsorption tower at its outlet ,not at its inlet.<br>
(11)	Backward Equalization Repressurization ER<br>
After the second stage gas repressurization step 2ER or the two-end equalization pressurization step2ER',<br>
the gas discharged from the cocurrent equalization depressurization step is introduced into the adsorption<br>
tower at outlet to pressurize the adsorption tower which has finished the backward depressurization step<br>
BD or the evacuation step VC or purge step P gradually, the times of the equalization repressurization step<br>
and the equalization depressurization step are the same. Every time the gas used for the equalization<br>
repressurization step comes from the gas of the equalization depressurization step of the different<br>
adsorption tower.<br>
(12)	Final Repressurization FR<br>
After the two-end equalization repressurization step2ER', the gas discharged from the outlet of the<br>
adsorption tower at the adsorption step is utilized to pressure the adsorption tower from the top till the<br>
adsorb pressure is reached.<br>
The second stage:<br>
(l)AdsorptionA<br>
The outlet gas discharged from the adsorption tower of the first stage which is in the adsorption step is<br>
introduced to the adsorption tower of the second stage device which is in the adsorption step. The strongly<br>
adsorbed component is adsorbed selectively by the adsorbent in the adsorption towers and is discharged<br>
from the outlet into the next stage. The strongly adsorbed component that adsorbed will increase<br>
continuously with the increase of time. The gas feed is stopped when the adsorbed component mentioned<br>
above reaches to the saturation on adsorbent, it means that the adsorption step finishes. The concentration<br>
of the strongly adsorbed component of the outlet gas is controlled according to the production requirement,<br>
it can be decreased lower to several ppm.<br>
(2)Cocurrent Equalization Repressurization ED<br>
After the adsorption step, the weakly adsorbed component concentration in the dead-space gas is rather<br>
high and this stream gas need to be recovered and reused. The dead-space gas discharged at different<br>
times from the outlet of the adsorption tower enters into the adsorption tower which has completed the<br><br><br>
evacuation step VC to increase the pressure. The gas is discharged every time and the pressure<br>
equalization is performed once. The concentration of the strongly adsorbed component at outlet of the<br>
adsorption tower increase continuously with the increase of the pressure equalization times. The<br>
pressure equalization times is determined by the adsorption pressure and the strongly adsorbed component<br>
concentration at the outlet of the adsorption tower after the adsorption step.<br>
(3)Cocurrent Depressurization PP<br>
After the cocurrent equalization depressurization step ED, the gas inside the adsorption tower is<br>
discharged cocurrent directly into the another adsorption tower to purge the strongly adsorbed component<br>
adsorbed on the adsorbent, another way, the gas is discharged into the buffer vessel at first, and then is<br>
discharged from the vessel into the another adsorption tower to purge the strongly adsorbed component<br>
adsorbed on the adsorbent to achieve the adsorbent regeneration. Cocurrent depressurization step PP can<br>
be performed once, and also two times, third times ,even if many times. The more times of the cocurrent<br>
depressurization step PP are adopted, the better purge effect is obtained and the less adsorbent dosage is<br>
used, but the higher investment in non-standard equipment ,special sequence valve, oil pressure system,<br>
control system and apparatus, moreover the dosage decreasing of the adsorbent is limited less and less<br>
along with the times of the cocurrent depressurization step PP increasing, the investment in non-standard<br>
equipment, special program control valve, oil pressure system, control system and apparatus will be more<br>
and more, so times of the cocurrent depressurization PP are not suitable for repeating many times.<br>
(4)Backward Depressurization BD<br>
After the cocurrent equalization depressurization step ED or cocurrent depressurization step PP, the gas is<br>
discharged at backward direction into the adsorption tower of the first stage.<br>
(5)Evacuation VC or purge P<br>
After the backward depressurization step BD, the strongly adsorbed component and other component<br>
adsorbed on adsorbent pulled by vacuum pump from the bottom of the adsorption tower is introduced into<br>
the first stage device to achieve the adsorbent regeneration; another way, the gas mixture discharged<br>
from the cocurrent depressurization step PP is used to purge the strongly adsorbed component adsorbed on<br>
the adsorbent to achieve the adsorbent regeneration. The gas mixture after the adsorbent purge step is<br>
discharged into the adsorption tower of the first stage device.<br>
(6) Backward Equalization Repressurization ER<br>
After the backward depressurization step BD or the evacuation step VC or the purge step P, the gas<br>
discharged from the cocurrent equalization depressurization step is introduced into the adsorption tower at<br>
outlet to pressurize the adsorption tower which has completed the backward depressurization step BD or<br>
the evacuation step VC or purge step P gradually, the times of the equalization repressurization step and<br>
the equalization depressurization are the same. Every time the gas used for the equalization<br>
repressurization step comes from the gas after the equalization depressurization step of the different<br>
adsorption tower.<br>
(7)Final Repressurization FR<br>
After the equalization repressurization step, the gas discharged from the outlet of the adsorption tower at<br><br><br>
adsorption step is utilized to' pressurize the adsorption tower from the top till the adsorb pressure is<br>
reached.<br>

the second stage is controlled less than 0.2v%.<br>
The shift gas enters into the first stage in adsorption step. The adsorbents adsorb selectively water, organic<br>
