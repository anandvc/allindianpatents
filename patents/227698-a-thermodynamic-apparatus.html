				<td>A THERMODYNAMIC APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
THIS   INVENTION   relates   to   a   thermodynamic   apparatus   having   a compressor, an expander and heat exchange means connected to the compressor and the expander, and a compressible working medium arranged to flow in the closed cycle. In particular but not limited the apparatus is a closed cycle and/or an indirect fired apparatus and<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Closed cycle thermodynamic apparatuses such as engines, heat pumps, coolers and the like have been known for some time. These apparatuses have a number of desirable attributes such as:<br>
-	no oxidation or carbonation occurs inside apparatus;<br>
-	unsuitable fuel sources such as coal or nuclear power can be used;<br>
-	inert gas, such as helium can be used as a working medium inside<br>
apparatus;<br>
-	gases with a higher specific heat can be used within apparatus to increase<br>
performance;<br>
-	pressures up to 20 atmospheres can be used to reduce apparatus size;'<br>
-	no inlet filtration is required and no turbine blade erosion occurs when the<br>
expander is a turbine;<br>
-	a flat specific fuel consumption when operating below full power can be<br>
Obtained as compressor entry pressure can be modulated for preserving cycle<br>
pressure ratio and stator outlet temperature.<br>
However, operating efficiency of these prior art closed cycle apparatuses is limited to about that of open cycle gas engines, even when equipped with a recuperator for recovering some heat from the exhaust gas.<br>
In view of the requirement of heat exchangers in the closed cycle apparatuses and the added expenses and maintenance work associated therewith, at the present time open cycle engines are usually preferred.<br>
Other thermodynamic apparatuses known to the applicant include an expander having a combustion chamber designed for a specific fuel.   Usually the<br><br>
fuel is of a high grade kind. The known apparatuses therefore cannot be used with an alternate fuel or energy source.<br>
Consequently there is abundance of low grade resources such as low grade coal, biomass, municipal waste and the like, which are unused and considered waste materials.<br>
These waste materials are normally left in the open and generally looked upon as environmental scars.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a closed cycle thermodynamic apparatus which will at least reduce one ormore of the above disadvantages.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an indirect fired thermodynamic apparatus which may be adapted to use low grade fuel resources.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect therefore the present invention resides in a thermodynamic apparatus comprising a compressor, an expander and heat exchange means connecting the compressor and the expander in a closed cycle, and a compressible working medium arranged to flow in the closed cycle. The apparatus further comprises heat recovery means having a heat transfer medium arranged to recover heat by transferring at least certain amount of the heat to and/or from the working medium.<br>
Preferably the heat recovery means is configured so that the temperature of the working medium is within a first predetermined range of temperatures when entering the compressor and/or within a second predetermined range of temperatures when entering the expander.<br>
The apparatus may have a combustion chamber arranged for preheating the heat transfer medium preceding to transferring heat to the working medium.<br>
It is preferred that the heat exchange means includes a first heat exchanger member and a second heat exchanger member, both of which being connected between the compressor and the expander. The first member is arranged downstream to the compressor, and the second member downstream to the<br>
expander. The heat transfer medium is arranged to transfer heat to one of said first and second members and to receive heat from the other of the first and second members.<br>
Desirably the heat transfer medium is arranged to travel in a counter flow relationship with said working medium.<br>
In one form the heat transfer medium is arranged to pass through the second member and to receive heat from the working medium, so that the temperature of the working medium is reduced to within the first range of temperatures. The heat transfer medium is then arranged to be heated in the combustion chamber so that at the second member it can transfer heat to the working medium to increase the temperature of the working medium to within the second range of temperatures. Typically the combustion  chamber  includes a burner for  heating the chamber and the apparatus has fuel preheating means arranged for preheating fuel for the burner. Suitably the preheating means is in the form of a fuel heat exchange member through which the heat transfer medium and the fuel are arranged to pass and  in a heat transfer relationship.<br>
Any one of the heat exchange members may have a first flow path for the<br>
x<br>
working medium and a second flow path for the heat transfer medium. Advantageously the first and second flow paths are conduits arranged in the heat exchanger or exchangers. More advantageously the conduits of the first and second flow paths are arranged parallel to each other and have a common wall.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention therefore has a higher thermal efficiency than the prior art closed cycle apparatuses as it recovers heat energy which is otherwise lost. Theoretically the apparatus according to the present invention can covert up to 100% of heat energy to mechanical power. This represents a jump in efficiency as the prior art heat recovery steam generation turbine has a theoretical maximum efficiency of only 60%.<br>
Further, as the combustion and working medium cycles are separate the fuel in the combustion chamber can be given enough time for a complete combustion. This is not possible with conventional turbines. Fuel sources for the apparatus may range from natural gas, petroleum, nuclear energy sources and coal.<br>
The heat transfer medium may be air, coal mine ventilation gases, water and any other suitable fluid.<br>
In another aspect therefore the present invention resides in a thermodynamic apparatus comprising a compressor arranged for compressing a compressible working fluid, an expander for expanding the working fluid, a heat exchange means interconnecting said compressor and said expander for heating the working fluid, and heating means arranged for heating a heat transfer medium and for supplying the heated medium to the heat exchange means for indirectly heating the working fluid while in said exchange means.<br>
The thermodynamic apparatus of this further aspect of the invention may be of open cycle or closed cycle type. Preferably it is a closed cycle type as hereinbefore described.<br>
Preferably the heating means is a combustor arranged for burning a low grade fuel including low grade coal, biomass or municipal waste, and converting said fuel into the heat transfer medium. Alternatively the heating means may be a solar cell arrangement having a conduit through which the heat transfer medium passes and one or more solar cells for collecting solar energy. The one or more solar cells are arranged to supply heat to the transfer medium.<br>
In one form the combustor is a kiln for burning said fuel for conversion into the heat transfer medium.  Typically said kiln is a rotary kiln.<br>
Desirably, said fuel is a low grade coal and the kiln is adapted to convert said coal into flue gas being a form of said heat transfer medium and ash which can be formed as a by-product such as closed or open cell spherical nodules for lightweight building materials. Limestone may be added to convert any sulphur dioxide to calcium sulphate. This should at least reduce the amount of low grade coal which poses environmental problems.<br>
If desired methane gas may also be introduced into the kiln for combustion. This is specially advantageous as very low concentration methane from an underground mine can be put into good use while at the same time removing it from the mine.<br>
The heated transfer medium exiting said heat exchange means may be channelled into the compressor for use as the working fluid or a supplement of the working fluid.<br>
The working fluid from said expander may also be channelled into the combustor to join said heat transfer medium.<br>
Advantageously, the apparatus further comprises heat storage means arranged for storing heat transferred from said heat transfer medium and for controllably releasing heat to be transferred to the working fluid. The heat storage means thereby serves to substantially control temperature of the working fluid and may also be used to even out varying temperatures caused-by fuel supplies of varying calorific value and quantity.<br>
Said heat storage means may include a phase changeable material which remains at least partially molten at temperatures expected while the apparatus is operated.<br>
The storage means may have a storage tank containing another heat transfer medium in heat transfer relationship with said phase changeable material.<br>
Typically said phase changeable material is NaCl; The said another heat transfer medium can be a Pb/Sn eutectic alloy.<br>
In one form the heat exchange means includes a first heat exchanger arranged for receiving the heat transfer medium from said heating means, and a second heat exchanger arranged for transferring heat to said working fluid, and the heat storage means is connected to said first and second"heat exchangers.<br>
A pump may be provided for circulating said another heat transfer medium around the heat exchange means and the heat storage means.<br>
The   apparatus  advantageously   includes  a  first  preheating   means  for preheating the fuel before entering the combustor.<br>
The apparatus may also include a second preheating means for preheating air and/or other fuel source before entering the combustor.<br>
A preconditioning means may also be provided for precooling the working fluid before entering the compressor.<br>
It is preferred that at least one of said first and second preheating means comprises a heat exchanger which is arranged so that said heat transfer medium, or working fluid is in a heat transfer relationship with said fuel, or air and/or other fuel source.<br>
Said preconditioning means may also comprise a heat exchange arranged so that said working fluid is in a heat exchange relationship with said heat transfer medium.<br>
A pressure control device may be provided for controlling pressure of said working fluid.<br>

Figure 8 is a schematic block diagram of the embodiment shown in Figure 3 provided with a heat recovery arrangement; and<br>
Figure 9 is another form of the heat transfer storage means shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 there is shown a block diagram of the closed cycle thermodynamic apparatus 10 according to the present invention. In this embodiment the apparatus 10 is for powering a turbo engine.<br>
The apparatus 10 has a compressor 12 for compressing a working medium which in this case is nitrogen, initially at temperature T1 = 50°C and supplied from a reservoir 14. The temperature of the nitrogen increases during compression. When leaving the compressor 12 the compressed nitrogen is at the temperatureT2 which is about 280°C. It is then expanded in an expander 16 for turning the shaft (not shown) of the turbo engine. In this manner mechanical work is extracted from the nitrogen.<br>
The apparatus 10 has a first heat exchanger 18 and a second heat exchanger 20 connected to the compressor 12 and the expander 16 in a closed cycle. That is, the working medium within the apparatus 10 is completely enclosed within the apparatus 10. It also has a burner 22 and a third heat exchanger 24 which will be described later in the specification.<br>
Air, as a Heat transfer medium, at ambient temperature T5 is induced into the second exchanger 20 to cool the nitrogen by receiving heat therefrom. The temperature of the nitrogen decreases from about T4 = 470°C to about temperature T1  =- 50°C before entering the compressor 12 for repeating the cycle.   The air which is now at a higher temperature of about T6 = 440°C is conveyed to the burner 22 where it is mixed with fuel which is LPG gas in this case, to form a combustion gas reaching an even higher temperature of about T7 = 1250°c and passed into the first exchanger 18 for heating the nitrogen at constant pressure. In this manner the temperature of nitrogen increases to about T3 = 1200°C when entering the expander 16. and following expansion for conversion to mechanical power it's temperature reduces to about T4 - 470°C.<br>
The LPG gas for the burner 22 is initially at ambient temperature T5 and is  preheated in the third exchanger 24 by flue gas resulting from the combustion. The <br>
flue gas is at about T8 = 330°C.when entering the third heat exchanger 24 and it preheats or transfers heat to the LPG gas to a temperature of about T10 = 315°C.<br>
The apparatus 10 thereby recovers heat at all the heat exchangers 18,  20 and 24. This reduces the amount of fuel required to heat the air for combustion.<br>
The heat recovered in heat exchangers 20 and 24 displaces fuel required to heat the air for heat exchanger 18 thus resulting in a high thermal efficiency.<br>
Inefficiencies of compression and expansion manifest themselves as heat and hence these are also recovered by the apparatus 10 according to the present invention.<br>
In total the only heat lost to the system is the difference between the flue gas exhaust temperature and the ambient temperature. Using a standard carnot cycle definition of efficiency, the maximum theoretical efficiency is given by<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Because of heat recovery, T4 is actually the waste heat rejection temperature, and T1 is the ambient temperature. Therefore, the efficiency is equal to 98%.<br>
In  Figure  2 the apparatus   10  according to the  present  invention   is schematically shown to power an Allison 250B turboprop engine. The nitrogen as the working medium is firstly compressed via an axial and centrifugal compressor 12.  Heat is then added to the nitrogen at constant pressure in the first heat exchanger 18. The heated nitrogen expands through a two stage axial turbine 16 to power the shaft and thus extract mechanical   power from the nitrogen. The expanded nitrogen returns to the compressor 12 after it is cooled to about its initial temperature in the second heat exchanger 20. Fresh air, at ambient temperature is induced into the second heat exchanger 20 to cool the exhaust gases from the turbine or expander 16.   The second heat Exchanger 20 is a welded plate heat exchanger with an efficiency of around 95%.   The air flowing through the second heat exchanger 20 is then added to the burner 22 where fuel such as LPG gas is added to raise the temperature to about 1250°C.  This hot combustion fuel passes<br>
through the third heat exchanger 24 in the form of a plasma welded plate heat exchanger to pass heat to the nitrogen. The combustion gases exit at a temperature of about 330°C. This excess heat is recovered through preheating fuel in the third heat exchanger 24, a conventional plate heat exchanger. The fuel is heated from ambient to approximately 315 °C and takes this heat into the combustion chamber. The heat recovered in fuel and air pre heating heat exchangers reduces the amount of fuel required to heat the air for the combustor heat exchanger thus resulting in a high thermal efficiency.<br>
If required, insulation is used on all components to minimise heat loss. In total the only heat lost from the apparatus 10 is the difference between the flue gas exhaust temperature and the ambient temperature.<br>
A flat specific fuel consumption at part power can be obtained by adjusting the compressor entry pressure from the working medium reservoir 14 to preserve the cycle pressure ratio and burner outlet temperature.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 there is schematically shown an embodiment of the indirect fired the thermodynamic apparatus  100 according to the present invention.   The apparatus 100 comprises a compressor 112 for compressing a working fluid which in this case is air, and passes the compressed air to an expander 114 which is a gas turbine in this case.   The gas turbine 114 may be a modified 250KW Allison 250-C18.    The modification  involves removal of its combustion chamber assembly and connection of the turbine  114 to a heat exchange means 116.<br>
The heat exchange means 116 is arranged so that the compressed air passes through one of its elements before entering the turbine 114. Its other element is in communication with a heating means or combustor 118 so that combustion products from a fuel source travel through said other elements whereby giving up heat to the working fuel.<br>
The heated working fluid expands in the turbine 114 and releases energy to drive an electricity generator 120 which is coupled to the turbine 114, the released energy is also used to drive-the compressor 11 2.<br>
In Figure 4, the combustor 118 of the apparatus 100 is in the form of a rotary kiln 122 adapted to receive low grade coal which has been ground to a size about 6 - 8mm.   The rotary kiln 122 is also designed so that the low grade coal has a relatively long residence time therein and a relatively large surface area of high temperatures, for ensuring combustion of very low concentration mine methane. A drier 124 is arranged to dry the coal from the rotary kiln 122. The apparatus 100 shown in Figure 4 can therefore be utilised to burn reject coal (low grade coal) and waste mine methane.<br>
The ash from the burnt coal can be processed so that it is converted into a useful   by-product  such  as  closed   or  open  cell   spherical   nodules   ideal   for manufacture of lightweight building materials and gravel substitutes.     In this manner, little or no fly ash or slag is produced from combustion of low grade coal with extremely high ash contents.<br>
Limestone can be added to convert any sulphur compound to calcium sulphate.<br>
The apparatus 100 shown in Figure 5 has the heat exchange means 116 in the form of a first heat exchanger 116A and a second heat exchanger 116B connected as shown. A heat storage means 126 is provided with a phase changeable material in a heat exchange relationship with another heat transfer medium which is controllably circulated between the first and second heat exchangers 116A and 116B in order to maintain a substantially consistent temperature in the compressed working fluid. This arrangement evens out fuel supplies of varying calorific value and quantity.<br>
The heat storage means 126 is shown more clearly in Figure 6. As shown the heat storage means 126 is in the form of an insulated tank 128 such as a 50KW NaCI storage tank with a Pb/Sn eutectic alloy flowable therethrough. As can be seen the Pb/Sn alloy is arranged to be heated in the first heat exchanger 116A by the flue gas to a molten stage from the combustor 118 and a pump 130 pumps the molten Pb/Sn alloy into the storage means 126. Within the storage tank 128 the conduit carrying the Pb/Sn alloy is coiled in order to increase the time therein so that more heat can be transferred into the latent heat storage cell (NaCI). The flow<br>
rate of the molten Pb/Sn al loy at the second heat exchanger 116B can be control led by varying the speed of the pump 130 thereby controlling heal to be transferred to the working fluid.<br>
In Figure 7, thecombustor 118 is replaced by a solar heat collection cell 32 with the heat exchanger 116A modified for accommodation the cell 132.<br>
In Figure 8, the apparatus 100 includes a heat recovery arrangement for preheating a fuel source or air with recovered heat. The heat recovery arrangement may include those described with reference to said one aspect of the invention.<br>
As shown, the heat recovery arrangement has a fuel pre-heater 1 34 arranged for recovering heat from the flue gas and use it so pre-heat the fuel, a third heat exchanger 136 for recovering heat from the working fluid to pre-heat air to the introduced into the combustor 118, and a fourth heat exchanger 138 for precool ing the working fluid prior to entering the compressor.<br>
In Figure 9, an alternative heat exchanger and storage system 140 is shown. The system 140 comprises an integrated heat exchanger 42 and a molten salt storage unit 144 for replacing the heat exchanger 116B and the storage unit 126, 128 shown in Figures 5 and 6. In this case the working fluid travels through the salt via heat exchange tubes 146 of the heat exchanger 142. Whilst not specifically shown the salt storage unit may be made separable from the air to air heat exchanger in the modular fashion.<br>
Whilst the above have been given by way of illustrative examples of the present invention many variations and modifications thereto will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the broad ambit and scope of the invention as herein set forth.<br><br><br><br><br>
