INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY;-<br>
The description maintained in the above paragraphs does not limit or restrict the scope of the present embodiment of the invention. Thus the same assembly unit can also be used for lifting of cartons, boxes, drums etc.<br>
WORKING MECHANISM OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS Mechanical System;-<br>
I. Lifting Table: - Standard Lifting tables are equipped to function long &amp; reliably with "normal" use. Lifting tables meant for intensive use with heavy loads, fast speed, extreme environment &amp; perhaps continuous working shifts. It is an angle frame structure fitted with idler rollers. The frame structure along with the idler rollers is mounted on a hydraulic cylinder. The essential purpose of the lifting table is to lift the pail/drum from the height of filling station to the height of the slat conveyor.<br>
II. Pusher Mechanism; - It is a simple arrangement of flats capable of pushing the pail/drum from the lifting table to the slat conveyor. A hydraulic cylinder operates the pusher mechanism. This mechanism enables the drum/pail to move from the lifting table to the slat conveyor. Once the pail/drum is on the conveyor then the conveyor moves and carries the pails/drums to a predetermined position on the conveyor.<br><br>
III.	Conveyor:-It is basically a mechanical apparatus used for carrying bulk material from place to place; for e.g. an endless moving belt or a chain of receptacles. It is a slat belt conveyor driven by an electric motor. The slat conveyor accomplishes the first linear stacking of pails/drums.<br>
IV.	Track forward pusher mechanism: - It is a simple arrangement of angles and flats, of sufficient strength/ tenacity, used to push the linearly stacked pails/drums on to the pail/drum holding carriage. It consists of hydraulic operated pushers arranged in parallel lines, such that when the pails/drums move from the conveyor belt the pusher forward mechanism pushes the already placed drum/pails onto the conveyor utilizing the track forward pusher mechanism.<br>
This arrangement of pushing linearly stacked pails/drums from the slat conveyor to the pail/drum holding carriage creates a rectangular stacking arrangement or matrix in pail/drum holding carriage.<br>
V. Pail/Drum holding carriage.-It is fabricated from flats and channels wherein the flats are used to hold and subsequently release the complete layer of pails. The carriage contains rectangular flats for holding pails or plates for holding drums. The carriage is directly connected to a hydraulic cylinder. The primary purpose of the carriage is to create and hold the matrix of pails/drums and to release the matrix on the palletization stand.<br>
VI. The up or down motion of the carriage is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder C4. The carriage is connected by means of chain and sprocket to the hydraulic cylinder.<br>
VII. The release mechanism is a rectangular structure made of flats. The pails are held at the necks by a rectangular flat, termed as neck holding flat. The pails are made to rest on the flats at their necks. The flats are<br><br>
supported at two ends. The end supports are in such a way so as to allow the flats to rotate about their longitudinal axis. One end of the flat is supported at the front side of the carriage and the other end is attached to a cam. The cams are connected to a hydraulic cylinder by a frame structure. The neck-releasing cylinder C5 controls the action of the frame structure. Initially the neck holding flats are horizontal in position. While releasing the necks, the cylinder moves downward and pushes the frame structure downwards. This downward motion causes the cams to rotate and simultaneously the neck holding flats rotate at 90° on its own axis. For release of Pail/drum a 90° turn (from horizontal to vertical) is given to the Pail/drum holding mechanism. A hydraulic cylinder C5 controls the release mechanism. The hydraulic cylinder is connected to the release mechanism by cams. The to and fro motion of the cylinder is converted by the cam to the rotary motion of the holding flats.<br>
Hydraulic  System:   -It basically  consists  of 5  hydraulic  cylinders  as mentioned below: -<br>
a.	Table lifting cylinder, CI.<br>
b.	Forward pusher cylinder, C2.<br>
c.	Track forward pusher cylinder, C3.<br>
d.	Carriage holding/lowering cylinder, C4.<br>
e.	Pail/Drum releasing Cylinder, C5.<br>
1.	There are a total of 5 cylinders. Oil under a certain pressure, which is 35<br>
bar, obtained from a power pack, is delivered to the cylinders.<br>
2.	Power Pack is a hydraulic pump system-supplying machine with high-<br>
pressure oil, wherein the motor is fitted with thermal overload protection.<br>
The power pack consists of a tank for holding oil, a pump and the motor,<br>
used for converting hydraulic energy into rotary motion, either fixed or<br>
variable for driving pump, which operates at 35bar pressure.<br><br>
3.	The pump sucks the oil from the tank, creates certain 35bar pressure in the oil and delivers the oil to the hydraulic cylinders via Direction control valves; it is a device for directing or preventing the oil flow in a system.<br>
4.	The Direction control valves are mounted on the top of the power pack plate besides the motor used to run the power pack. Two ports are provided on the Direction control valve, wherein ports form the internal or external terminals of passage, the point where fitting mechanism for control valves is attached which allows passage of oil from the respective hydraulic cylinders.<br>
5.	Similarly, two ports are provided for activation/working of the cylinder. Each cylinder is provided with a control valve.<br>
6.	The two ports of the valve are connected to the two ports of each cylinder.<br>
7.	When oil under a certain pressure is supplied to one of the ports then the cylinder piston moves forward/backward depending on the port on which oil under pressure is applied.<br>
8.	While oil is supplied to one port of the hydraulic cylinder, simultaneously oil from other port is removed, because it is imperative to make sure the oil is delivered clean to the gearbox. This may mean dispensing through a filter-cart or using a one-shot type sealed lubricant container supplied at a certified level of cleanliness. The fill port must also be clean prior to use. Like minimises sampling ports, two ports of the valve minimizes the risk of ingested contamination providing space for the incoming oil.<br>
9.	The P.L.C controls the said Direction control valves.<br>
10.	The cylinder piston moves forward/backward or up/down direction<br>
depending on the port in which oil is being supplied.<br>
11.Cylinder CI has top &amp; down position. C2 has forward or backward position. C3 has forward and backward position. C4 has a) uppermost<br>
8<br><br>
position b) pail loading position c) level 1 position d) level 2 positions<br>
and e) level 3 positions. C5 has up and down position. 12.The oil pressure is obtained from a power pack, which is an integral part<br>
of the hydraulic system. Electrical System: -<br>
The Palletizer is fully automatic in operation. The automation is controlled by a P.L.C. (Programmable Logic Controller) mounted in the control panel. The various sensors mounted on the machine at relevant locations provide inputs to the P.L.C. The different types of sensors used are as follows: -<br>
1.	Inductive sensors:.- Inductive sensor detects only metals. Inductive<br>
sensors are used to determine the positions of the entire hydraulic<br>
cylinders. Every cylinder except C4 has two positions. Cylinder C4<br>
has five positions. Inductive sensors control all these positions.<br>
Each sensor is fixed at the exact backward/forward or up/down of each cylinder. Each cylinder is operated through a direction control valve, which in turn is controlled by the P.L.C. The sensors detect the exact position of each cylinder and this position is communicated to the P.L.C. controller. The P.L.C. then directs that particular cylinder according to the programmable logic. In all there are 13 inductive sensors used to detect the positions of Hydraulic Cylinders.<br>
2.	Reflective sensors: - Reflective sensors can detect any object. In the<br>
palletizer these sensors are used to detect pails/drums and are also<br>
called as I/R sensors. These reflective sensors perform two functions.<br>
Total there are six reflective sensors. The first three reflective sensors<br>
control the On Off motion of the conveyor. Other three reflective<br>
sensors detect the stacking layers.<br>
9<br><br>
Based on the inputs obtained from the sensors and according to a predetermined logic the P.L.C. then directs the operation of the various cylinders and conveyors. There are two types of sensors used, namely Inductive sensors and I/R sensors. The inductive sensors can sense only metals, whereas I/R sensors can sense any object. The sensing range for inductive sensor is 5mm and for I/R sensor is 200mm. The position of all the hydraulic cylinders is sensed by the inductive sensor and the product eg. (Pails / drums) is sensed by the I/R sensor.<br>
All cylinders except C4 have two positions, i.e. forward or backward. Cylinder C4 has five positions. The five positions are:-<br>
1.	Topmost position.<br>
2.	Pail/Drum loading position.<br>
3.	Level 1 position.<br>
4.	Level 2 position.<br>
5.	Level 3 position.<br>
Two inductive sensors are provided for each cylinder at their extreme positions, i.e. forward or backward. For cylinder C4 in addition to the two sensors, three more are provided for its Pail/Drum loading position, level 2 positions and level 3 positions.<br>
WORKING PROCESS OF PAIL PALLETIZER<br>
To be able to start the palletizer in auto mode an empty load-carrying platform (pallet) has to be placed in the machine. The operation starts by pressing the 'Process On' switch provided on the control panel.<br>
1. During the start of the operation cycle all the hydraulic cylinders move to their respective initial positions. Cylinder CI moves to its down most<br>
10<br><br>
position, cylinder C2 moves to its forward most position, Cylinder C3 moves to its forward most position, Cylinder C4 moves to its pail loading position and cylinder C5 moves to its upper most position. An indication is given to the operator informing that the palletizer is ready for receiving pails/drums.<br>
2.	A packed pail/drum is placed on the lifting table. A reflective sensor mounted on the lifting table senses the pail/drum. A hydraulic cylinder (CI) operates the lifting table by moving it forward/backward movement. The cylinder lifts the table to the height of the slat conveyor. Once the table reaches the height of the Slat conveyor the pail/drum is pushed on to the conveyor by the pushing mechanism. The pushing mechanism is hydraulically operated by Forward pusher cylinder C2 wherein the pails/drums are loaded individually on a conveyor belt arrangement; the pusher mechanism consists of a rectangle flat attached to one end of the frame structure.<br>
3.	As the pushing mechanism reaches its back most position, a signal is given to the conveyor through PLC control to operate.<br>
The conveyor moves and carries the pail/drum along with it. When the pail/drum passes a reflective sensor mounted on the conveyor senses the pail/drums, whereby a stop signal through PLC control is given to the conveyor. In this way the pail/drum reaches a predetermined position on the conveyor.<br>
4.	The above process continues for the required number of rows. Once the<br>
required numbers of pails/drums are on the conveyor, an I/R sensor<br>
present at the end of the conveyor senses the pails/drums. This sensor<br>
gives a signal to the P.L.C., which in turn activates cylinder C3. The<br>
complete line of pails/drums is pushed in the pail/drum holding frame.<br>
11<br><br>
5.	The above process continues for the required number of columns. A sensor is located at the backside of the carriage. This sensor senses the completion of Layer and accordingly gives a signal to the P.L.C. The P.L.C. then directs the cylinder C4 to move and the carriage is moved to its required position.<br>
6.	For a matrix of three layers, there are three positions for the carriage to release the pails/drums, i.e. level 1, level 2 and level 3. Three I/R sensors are placed vertically on the columns of the carriage assembly to determine the layer completion. Initially all the three levels are empty. The filled carriage moves to the position of level 1 and releases the pails/drums. The I/R sensor present senses this layer and gives a signal to the P.L.C. about the completion of layer 1. Following filled carriage is directed to move to the second layer position and releases the pails/drums. The third layer stacking follows this. In this way the three layers are stacked.<br>
7.	The holding mechanism is different for pails and drums. The pails have a protruding edge along the upper rim termed as neck. Two rectangular section flats which are attached to the inner side of the columns of the carriage assembly possessing/bearing a gap 215mm for l0Kgs and 284mm for 20Kgs, corresponding to the diameter of the pail at the upper rim. The pail neck is made to rest on the rectangular flats, termed as neck holding flats. In this way the pails are held. The design of the pail holding mechanism, using neck-holding flats allows movement of the pails along the length of the flats. The flats are supported at two ends. The supports are in such a way so as to allow the flats to rotate about their longitudinal axis. One end of the flat is supported at the front side of the carriage and the other end is attached to a cam. The linear motion of the hydraulic cylinder is converted by the cams to rotary motion of the neck holding flats.  The cams are connected to a hydraulic cylinder by a frame<br>
12<br><br>
structure. The pails are made to rest on the pallet and the release mechanism is thereby activated thus rotating the flats through 90° making them vertical thereby giving enough clearance for the flats to pass through.<br>
8.	The above present invention can also be used for drums, not bearing<br>
protruding edges as in the case of pails. The drums are held at the bottom<br>
edge by two L-shaped side grippers. The grippers are designed in such a<br>
way to allow the drum to travel along its entire length of the flat<br>
assembly. The grippers are positioned in such a way so that they can<br>
rotate about their longitudinal axis. The side grippers rotate about their<br>
centres and while rotating the grippers separate away, thereby releasing<br>
the drums on the pallet. The two grippers rotate in opposite direction. The<br>
inside distance between the side grippers is slightly more than the<br>
maximum diameter of the drum. The bottom rim of the drum is made to<br>
rest on the side gripers. There is no positive or friction grip on the drum<br>
by the grippers. Separating the grippers and allowing the drums to fall<br>
freely on the load-carrying platform release the drums. The individual<br>
grippers are connected to a rectangular flat paced between the grippers<br>
rotating the flat through 90° separates the grippers. A hydraulic cylinder<br>
via a cam provides the rotary motion to the flats.<br>
9.	After releasing a layer of pails/drums on the load-carrying platform the<br>
pail/drum holding carriage returns to its pail/drum loading position.<br>
10.The above-mentioned process continues for a required number of layers.<br>
Once the layers are completed then all the cylinders, except cylinder C4,<br>
move to their start position and cylinder C4 moves to its top most<br>
position. 1l.An alarm is sounded indicating the completion of one cycle of operation,<br>
which hardly takes 10-12 minutes. The platform on which the subsequent<br>
13<br><br>
pails are stacked has to be removed and an empty platform has to be placed in the Palletizer for the start of the second cycle.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF INVENTION:-<br>
1.	As compared to other Pail Palletizers they have advantages over cost &amp; functioning of the carriage.<br>
2.	Previously, patented Palletizers were used only for lifting cans, small rectangular boxes, etc. But by making proper arrangement for process &amp; the carriage assembly they have made an invention by automatically lifting pails for the Customers.<br>
3.	The equipment or the materials used for designing the Palletizer are easily available in the market.<br>
4.	Proper usage of the resources has been maintained.<br>
5.	Maintenance cost is very low, because of less wear &amp; tear of the internal components.<br>
6.	The new Palletizer can handle matrix up to 5 *5 pails in single procedure.<br>
7.	Initially, the pails/drums were lifted manually from filling station and were placed on the pallet, which takes much time for single operation.<br>
8.	It has an added advantage of saving the manual effort by providing a conveying system for transferring objects such as pails, where the present invention arranges the object in layers on a pallet and is improved by the addition of sensors that provide early indications of movements of components parts of the pail palletizer to a control panel where signals are used in a more efficient operation of the pail palletizer.<br>
9.	In the future designs there may be a slight variation in the arrangement of various components, but the holding and release mechanism will be same for all designs.<br>

DESCRIPTION WITH ACCOMPANYING DIAGRAMS<br>
The following is the explanation of the entire Palletization process. <br>
Fig no. 1: - This view shows the first stage of the Palletizer. During the initial position a filled pail/drum is kept on the lifting table. A pail presence sensor present on the lifting table senses the pail/drum and starts the successive operations.<br>
Fig no.2:- This diagram shows the second stage of the palletizer. After the pail presence sensor has sensed the pail/drum, a signal is sent to the P.L.C. The P.L.C. then signals the lifting table to rise up to the level of the conveyor taking the pail/drum with it. Once the table has reached its level, a signal is sent to the P.L.C, which in turn activates the Forward pusher cylinder.<br>
Fig no.3;- This diagram shows the third stage. In this view the forward pusher cylinder has pushed the pail/drum on to the conveyor. Once the forward pusher cylinder reaches it backmost position a signal is sent to conveyor to start. This conveyor moves for a specific period and stops.<br>
Fig no.4:- In this diagram, the Lifting table and Forward pusher cylinder are back to their initial position. The conveyor has moved for a specific period and has stopped, and thereby carrying the pail/drum along with it.<br>
Fig no.5:- In this diagram, five pails are seen on the conveyor table. The above-mentioned process has repeated for five times. Once five pails/drums are on the conveyor table, a conveyor stop sensor present at the end of the conveyor senses the pails/drums and accordingly sends a signal to the P.L.C. The  P.L.C.   Controller  in  turn  activates  the   Track  Forward  pusher<br>
15 <br>
mechanism, which pushes the line of five pails/drums in to the pail/drum holding carriage.<br>
Fig no.6;- In this diagram, the five pails are pushed in to the pail/drum holding carriage by the Track forward pusher mechanism. A hydraulic cylinder C3 operates the Track forward pusher mechanism. Notice the Track forward pusher mechanism is at its back-most position.<br>
Fig no.7:- In this diagram, the pail/drum holding carriage is filled with the required number of pails/drums. The above-mentioned process has repeated five times and subsequently filled the pail/drum holding carriage. Once the carriage is full, a layer completion sensor present at the end of the carriage senses and accordingly signals the P.L.C. Controller. The P.L.C. Controller then signals the carriage lowering mechanism, which lowers the entire filled carriage on to the pallet.<br>
Fig no.8:- In this diagram, the filled carriage has lowered the layer of pail/drum on to the pallet. Once the carriage reaches this position, a signal is sent to the P.L.C. Controller to release the pail/drum on the pallet.<br>
Fig no.9:- In this diagram, the complete matrix of pails/drums is placed on the pallet and the carriage is back to its loading position. All the above-mentioned process repeats till the required numbers of layers are stacked.<br>

ABSTRACT;-<br>
The Pail Palletizer were designed to make an automatic arrangement for pails, by making an arrangement for the carriage assembly by carrying it from slat conveyor and downloading it to the pallet, reducing the manual effort to a greater extent increasing time as well as energy. The carriage contains rectangular flats for holding pails or plates for holding drums. The carriage is directly connected to a hydraulic cylinder. The purpose of the carriage is to hold the matrix of pails/drums and to release the matrix on the palletization stand. There is also a step-by-step procedure arrangement, known as process for sequential access of pails/drums accordingly with the help of components used during the process to make the process faster and get completed within the stipulated period of time. The efficiency of Pail Palletizer with respect to Customer is fully 100%, as it is designed as per the Customer satisfaction &amp; if taken into consideration of I/P / O/P, it comes to 90%. The Pail Palletizers are provided with safety mesh to avoid any accidents &amp; also view the process running successfully.<br><br><br>
