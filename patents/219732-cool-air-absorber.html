FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention pertains to the apparatus and fixtures which provides ventilation and cool air in the rooms, houses and halls.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Now a day In hot summers, to protect from heat, we are using air coolers and air conditioners etc., which are more expensive and consumes more electric power. Air conditioners are not available to common and middle class dwellers as it is more costly and causing heavy electric bills. People are tend to buy the Air Coolers which are cheaper and affordable by every one. But these air coolers are health hazards as they pump more air, which is artificially cooled by adding the humidity in the air. This causes asthmatic, breathing trouble on long run.<br>
By understanding these problems and drawbacks, the inventor has put his mind towards the development of a low cost and high efficient air ventilating system which can cool the rooms or bring the room temperatures down to the existing outside temperatures especially in the nights.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
As known in the art, the earlier known devices of ventilation are the ceiling fans, exaust fans, table fans etc., which doesn't come into the perview of the said invention. There are no other reported publications on this device earlier to the invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
1. It is the primary object of the invention that this device can be an-anged to any room at a cheaper cost and is a permanent device durable for a long time requiring no replacement upto 30 years.<br><br>
2.	It is the another pbject of the invention that, no special electric power is required. It works if a celling fan In the room works. And cooling continues for few hours even after ceiling fan is switched off.<br>
3.	It is the further object of the Invention ttiat even the doors of the windows are closed, fresh and cool air continues to flow into the room.<br>
4.	It is the further object of the invention that the device can be an-anged to all types of RCC buildings, tiled houses with inner ceiling, cinema halls, auditoriums etc., for continuous flow of fresh and cool air for any number of people.<br>
5.	It is the further object of the invention that during summer by this device the room cools down in one hour.<br>
The above and other objects features and disadvantages will be clear from the following description of preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE rNVENTiON:<br>
The cool Air Absorber is a device of 12" x 15" (approx) aluminium projection along with a 4" (approx) diameter inner pipe to supply the out side air into the room. The device absorbs the cool air from the outer atmosphere and directs the same air towards the ceiling fan in the room without taking any additional electric power. The fan creates low-pressure area in its surface and cool air automatically flows into the room through this device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Now the invention will be described in detailed with reference to drawings which accompany this complete specification.<br>
Figure 1 shows the diagram of the device fixed above the fan towards the ceiling.<br>
Figure 2 shows the diagram of the flow of the air in the room showing the intake of the cool air and exhaust of the hot air from the room.<br><br>
In the Figure 1, 1 is the aluminium projection of approximate size 18"x12^ 2 is the PVC pipe of AT diameter, 3 is the spring attached to the shutter, 4 is the shutter attached to the inner end of the PVC pipe, 5 is the thread, 6 is the Gl wire mesh, 7 is the ceiling fan, 8 is the gap between ceiling and fan blades, 9 is the gap between ceiling and PVC pipe, 10 is the Gl wire mesh to protect from insects, 11 is the room ventilator, 12 is a small hole for dropping rain water.<br>
In tfie Figure 2, 13 is the outer air being absorbed by the low pressure created above the ceiling fan, 14 is the cool air pumped down by the ceiling fan, 15 is the hot air pushed up due to lighter weight, 16 is the hot air exists out from the ventilatons.<br>
The drawings are given by way of non-limitive example to explain the nature of the invention. For a more complete understanding of the instant invention references is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.<br>
Actually, in the hot summer the top ceiling of the RCC building wii! be hot at the day time due to the higher temperatures in the day weather. In the evening when the weather cools down the room temperatures will not come down as the RCC building takes much time to cool to the outside night temperatures. And in this process the inside room temperatures will stay hot until the total building cools down which extends to the late nights or after midnights in some days. In this conditions when a ceiling fan is used in the living room or a bed room for sleeping, while the RCC ceiling above the ceiling fan is hot the hot air will automatically come down and spread in the room through ceiling fan. It will be too uncomfortable to any one until the RCC ceiling is cooled to give the normal temperature air.<br>
Here the inventor's device cool air absorber will absorb the cool air from the atmosphere outside the room and project it through the PVC pipe on the ceiling fan of the room.<br>
The cool air absorber device has a 18"x12' (approx) aluminium projection 1, as shown in the figure 1 and this projection is attached to 4" (approximately) diameter<br><br>
pipe 2 as shown in the figure 1, and this pipe is projected on ceiling fan through the ventilators or through a hole provided to the wall of the room.<br>
This device is fixed at 1 feet (approx) below the ceiling and is projected towards the ceiling fan. The projected pipe ends are guarded with Gl wire mesh from mosquitoes and flies. The inner end of the device is provided with a shutter which can be opened during evenings and closed during day time by a thread provided for the operations.<br>
Principle involved in the invention: The rotating ceiling fan creates low pressure area in its upper surface and the cool air automatically is suck from the PVC pipe into the room from outside atmosphere. Here the outer cool air in the nights and evenings is absorbed from the outer air column and projected through rotating ceiling fan.<br>
Automatically fan creates low pressure area at its top between the ceiling and fan blades and absorb the outer cool air the project it into the room and spread it. The hot air between the heated ceiling and fan blades and inside the room being the lighter weight will automatically exists out through the ventilators provided at the top of the room.<br>
It takes at least half and hour to one hour time to subsidies the temperature of the furniture almirahs and the other articles in the room, which are already heated through out the day.<br>
The aforesaid description is outlined rather broadly prefen^ed and alternative features of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that followed. Additional features of the invention will be described herein after that form the subject of claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purpose of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention its broadest form.<br><br>
It will be understood that the aforesaid description is only illustration of the present invention and is not intended that the present invention is limited thereto. Many other specific embodiment of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. Any substitution, alteration or modification of the present invention which come within the scope of claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br><br><br>
CLAIMS:<br>
IClaim,<br>
01.	A device created to absorb the out side air into the room and spread it through<br>
the ceiUng fan having a projection, pipe and shutter.<br>
