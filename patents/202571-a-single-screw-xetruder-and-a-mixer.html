				<td>-2-FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention relates in one aspect  to  a  single screw  extruder for eKtruding combinations of materials  such  as thermoplastics  polymers, rubbers, waxes and solid additives  and in another aspect to a mixer for such materials. The mixer could however be employed in the manufacture of inks, paints and other materials where one or more of the components is liquid at the room temperature.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Single screw extruders are very widely used in the plastic industry  for  producing compounds of  rubber  and  thermoplastic polymers with solid additives. They are simple to construct and therefore relatively inexpensive, however that they have limited distributive  and  dispersive  mixing  capacity  has  been   long recognised  and  is well documented ( of " Single  Screw  Mixing: Problems and Solutions" Martin Gale,a paper presented at a RAPRA Technology Ltd. seminar 08/06/95).<br>
Further  background as to the mixing limitations  of  single screw extruders is given in an article in Plastics Additives and Compounding  August/September  1995 pages 21-23  entitled  "  New dispersive mixers based on elongational flow" and the  associated patent,  US 5932159, published  3 August 1999, This stresses  the<br><br>
-3-<br>
need far a variety of dispersive forces including elongation flow and multiple passes through regions of high stress, conditions which are normally difficult to generate within a single screw machine.<br>
There  are  many  devices that can be used  to  improve  the distributive mixing capacity of single screw extruders; however these  devices  offer only marginal  improvements  in  dispersive mixing. A good example of this is the cavity transfer mixer (US 4419014)  where  the  process  melt  is   transferred  repeatedly between  cavities in a rotor and opposed cavities in  the  barrel wall. The rotary motion of the rotor means that the material is constantly  subdivided  and reâ€”oriented. However  this  does  not generate a high shear rate since the walls of opposing cavities are  quite widely separated. In practical devices this low  shear rate  also  limits  the  maximum cavity size  since  there  is  a tendency for the melt to stagnate.<br>
Pins can also be used to improve mixing either protruding radially from the barrel or from the surface of a rotor or the screw itself. Whilst pins do generate chaotic flow improving distributive mixing, they do little in the way of dispersive mixing since the pins do not move relative to a complementary shear surface-  In  the  case of pinned barrels, gaps  in  the  helical<br><br>
-4-<br>
flight  sweep aver   the pins generate high sheer events  and  also<br>
it<br>
allow significant re-circulation of the polymer melt improving distributive mixing. However, the proportion of material subjected to high shear is quite small.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
A basic object of the invention is the provision of an improved single screw extruder and to a mixer for use with such extruder.<br>
SUMMARY OF A FIRST ASPECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a single screw extruder comprising a drivable screw, with at least one flight, located within a static barrel so as to define an annular material flow gap between the exterior of the screw and the interior of the barrel, a mixer associated with the screw, whereby material passes from an upstream portion of the flow gap, into the mixer and is then either returned to a downstream portion of the flow gap or is discharged, with the mixer comprising a rotor driven by the screw and a stator, the rotor and the stator each carrying mutually facing interengaging rings of teeth whereby the material is urged outwardly from the annular gap along a first tortuous mixing path, and then returned inwardly along a second tortuous mixing path, the teeth extending<br>
^1<br><br>
-5-<br>
axially or generally so, with respect to the longitudinal axis of the screw,<br>
SUMMARY OF A SECOND ASPECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a mixer far mixing solids with liquids, liquids and liquids eg, polymer alloys for use with other devices or combinations of devices capable of driving the rotor and introducing material in a fluid state into the mixer under sufficient pressure to cause the material to be mixed to flow through the mixer, the mixer comprising: (i)     a  cylindrical stator chamber having  opposed,  radially<br>
extending   faces  provided  with   axially   projecting,<br>
radially spaced-apart rings made up of alternating teeth<br>
and ridges, ii)     a rotor rotatably fitted within the stator and  provided<br>
on  its  opposite  side faces  with  axially  projecting,<br>
radially  spaced-apart  rings of  alternating  teeth  and<br>
ridges, and iii)    the rotor and stator rings interengaging with both radial<br>
and  axial clearance so as to define a tortuous  material<br>
flow path.<br><br><br>
6<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The extruder in accordance with the first aspect has been found to provide significant improvement in the extruder performance and the quality of extruded product compared with prior art single screw extruders, whilst the mixer in accordance with the second aspect has been found to be particularly advantageous and to provide a fundamental improvement in the mixing of sol ids and liquids such as a liquid thermoplastics material and solid additive and improve the manufacture of polymer alloys. The rings on the stator may be as thin as possible whilst   maintaining  mechanical  integrity  since   their   only<br>
r<br>
functions are to provide a barrier to melt flow and complementary shear surfaces to the rotor. This arrangement 1imits possible melt stagnation in the gaps between stator teeth. In addition, the screw may serve as a main bearing for the mixer, whilst because the teeth are concentric around the barrel, there is no constraint on the length of the teeth that may be provided.<br>
PREFERRED OR OPTIONAL FEATURES OF THE EXTRUDER<br>
The mixer is located intermediate the ends of the screw.<br>
The   mixer  is  located  at  the  discharge  end   of   the<br>
screw/extruder.<br>
As  the  extruder  will be used for  extruding  a  range  of<br>
materials,  it  is  clear  that  a  suite  of  mixers  exhibiting<br><br>
-7-<br>
differing a geometrical properties to provide different mixing capabilities is desirable for optimum mixing- Thus, to permit reasonably  expedient  changing  of  a  mixer,  the  extruder  is provided  with readily releasable means eg a pair  of  releasable flanges within which the mixer is housed.<br>
The internal diameter of stator chamber is larger than the internal diameter of the extruder to which it is attached and the rotor is relatively short.<br>
PREFERRED OR OPTIONAL FEATURES OF THE MIXER:<br>
Clearly,  the  mixer  can be used in  combination  with  any apparatus capable of introducing the materials to be mixed under sufficient pressure to cause these materials to flow through the mixer. One such apparatus is a single screw extruder. Thus it is necessary to provide the mixer with an entry aperture and an exit aperture  for material feed under pressure into through, and  out of  the exit aperture of the mixer . In the mixer  the  materials undergo four actions namely (i) a radial movement under pressure suitably  from  a central feed port to an outlet  port,  Cii)  an orbital  movement  involving  division  of  the  radially  moving materials  into portions some of which go one way  while  vicinal<br><br><br>
8<br>
portions go the opposite way and (i i i) a shearing action (iv) an elongational deformation.<br>
This mixer differs from that of a conventional BKtrader configuration with a long thin screw and any  ancillary mixers are contained in a narrow cylinder, i.e. the primary internal barrel diameter- since the mixer has in it is preferred configurations, a  short broad rotor within a chamber with an  internal  diameter greater than that" of the barrel to which it Is attached. Looking at this basic geometry two significant advantagaes become  clear. Firstly the shortest path length through the mixer increases only linearly with rotor radium whilst the volume aval 1 able for mixing increases  with  the  square of  that  radius.  Secondly  angular velocity  raises linearly with the rotor radium. This means  that the  largest mixing volume coincides with  the highest  potential shear rates.<br>
By interengage is meant that the teeth of a rotor or stator ring always extend into the valley defined between a pair of adjacent rings of the stator or rotor, whi1st the ridges may or may not extend into that valley- Means are provided to drive angularly the rotor or the stator or both so that there is relative movement between the two. Normally only the rotor will be driven to rotate about its axis.<br><br>
-9-<br>
In one form of the mixer, the rings are concentric to the axis of the rotor. However they may also be arranged eccentrically which results in a cleaning action when the rings approach each other. The maximum eccentricity is 1imited to the separation between the rings forming the complementary valley on the complementary component-<br>
The maximum combined height of a given ring and tooth at any point on the surface of either the stator or rotor is limited  by the  separation of the stator and rotor. The separation can  vary between 0.1 and 300 mm. preferably 1 to 100 mm.<br>
The combined height of the ridges and teeth can be varied by any amount within this limit either around the circumference or along a radial path. The variation can be either continuous or discontinuous i.e. the transition can be slopped or stepped) but in the preferred formÂ» the ridges and teeth are uniform in height -<br>
The thickness of both the teeth and ridges around their circumference can be varied but in the preferred form is uniform. This thickness can range from 0.1 mm to 100mm preferably 1â€”30 mm-<br><br><br>
10<br>
Any tooth may combine any or all of these characteristics and the transition between them may be continuous or discontinuous i.e. the transition may be slopped or stepped.<br>
The  stator,  rotor, ridges and teeth may be made  from  any material   that   is  dimensionally  stable  at   the   operating temperature  and  under  the  mechanical  strains  generated   in operation.  Such materials include steel* ceramics,  rubber  and plastics.<br>
The ridges and teeth can be either permanently or removably attached to the rotor and stator. Removable ridges and teeth may also be attached as to allow their repositioning and reorientation. The status which defines the chamber around the rotor may also be either permanently or releasably assembled around the rotor.<br>
Preferably the stator is defined by a pair of mutually facing cup shaped inserts which are clamped together opening-to-opening. When assembled into a single screw extruder, such clamping would be between the extended flanges of the front and rear barrels. In this way the miKing geometry of the device may be altered by replacing the relatively inexpensive inserts.<br>
e<br>
In  operation)  the pressure gradient from  inlet  of  th mixer to outlet causes material to flow through the device. There<br><br>
-11-<br>
are three tortuous routes that the material can take. A zigzag route over the intermeshing annular ridges and teeth, a route along the annular channels defined by the ridges and a route through the gaps between teeth. All three routes are continuously changing due to relative motion and take material up one a face of the rotor across its edge and the back down the obverse.<br>
In one configuration the gaps between teeth on the stator and the rotor are arranged to form radial channels. The rotational motion of the rotor leads to periodic alignment of teeth and gaps and gaps and gaps between the rotor and stator.<br>
However the gaps may be staggered to alter the mixing the characteristics. For any given ring the combined length of teeth and gaps is equal to the cirumference of that ridge. The teeth may be of any length along the ring within this total taut need not be uniform in length.<br>
Dispersive mixing occurs in the gaps between the faces of the annular ridges and teeth on the rotor and their counterparts on the stator. Material within these gaps is subject to both pressure and drag flow due to the motion of the rotor. In this way the melt in the high shear zone is constant refreshed. Distributive mixing then ensures that this well-dispersed material is evenly distributed through the bulk of the melt.<br><br>
-12-<br>
Distributive miKing results from the repeated cutting of the melt as it emerges from gaps between teeth on the stator and also as it enters the next set of gaps between the teeth on the stator. Since the speed of flow into and out of these gaps is slower near to the defining teeth than in the middle? significant reorientation of the melt also occurs.<br>
The  mixer  can  be used in conjunction  with  a  number  of functional ancillary elements each of which can be supported by a number of well known devices. The ancillary elements include! a) means of receiving the process material!<br>
b&gt; means of melting one or more of the components to generate 1iquid; c)  means of degassing the process melt of the inlet side of<br>
the mixer; d&gt;  means  of generating pressure on the inlet  side  of  the mixeri<br>
e)	means of driving the rotor of the mixer;<br>
f)	means of degassing the process melt on the outlet side of the mixer;<br>
g)	means  generating  pressure on the outlet  side  of  the<br>
mixer;<br>
h)   means of filtering the process melt; and i)   means of farming the process melt.<br><br>
-13-<br>
Elements d and e are always required far the operation of the mixer. The need far the other ancillary functional elements is dependent on the users needs, but a single screw extruder can provide functional elements a, b, C, d and e then f- g. h and i.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the single screw extruder comprises a spl ine 1 or other coupling from the rotary drive to rear extruder screw, a cooling jacket 2, a funnel and feed zone 3, a rear extruder screw 4) a rear barrel 5, an enlarged flange 5A, a front barrel 6, an enlarged flange 6A, a die 7, a discharge nozzle 8, a front screw 9) a rear mixing insert 12 and a front mixing insert 10 which together form a chamber about a mixing rotor 11 and a drive spindle 13. The screw of the single screw extruder is thus interrupted by the presence of the mixer 14 comprising elements 10, 11, 12 and 13.<br>
Figure la is a drawing of one embodiment of the invention where the mixer 14 consists of a rear mixing insert 12 and a front mixing insert 10 which together form a chamber about a mixing rotor 11 and a drive spindle 13. Barrels 5 and 6 can be heated and zone 3 can be coolerd by means of a cooling jacket 2. In  addition, the flanges joining the extruder barrels 5a and  6a<br><br>
-18-<br>
can be heater or cooled to maintain a balance between heat losses to the environment and heat generated within the mixer again by means not shown.<br>
Referring to Figures 2, 2a, and 2b, the inside surface of insert 10 is made up of a series of radially spaced-apart rings 22a, 22b, 22c and 22d. Mounted on the rings are circumferentially spaced-apart and axially projecting teeth 21 so that gaps between adjacent teeth constitute ridges 20 giving the rings a castellated appearance.<br>
Referring to Figures 3, 3a and 3b, the rotor 11 is mounted on a drive spindle 13 and consists of a circular body, oposed faces of which are each provided with a series of radially spaced-apart rings 32a, 32b, 32c and 32d. Mounted on the rings are circumferentially spaced-apart and axially projecting teeth 31 so that gaps between adjacent teeth constitute ridges 30 giving the rings a castellated appearance - The rings 323, 32b, 32c. and 32d intermesh with rings 22a, 22b, 22c and 22d in the functional position illustrated in Figures 4, 4a and 4b and in Figures 5, 5a and 5b. The rings, teeth and ridges are so juxtaposed as to define a tortuous mixing flow path for material with the arrows 40 and 41 (Figure 4) illustrating the path of least resistance to the melt flow through gaps between teeth.  As<br><br>
-19-<br>
drawn  the  flow off the rotor is not constrained by  the  second insert (12) i.e. only one half of the mixer shown.<br>
As  the  rotor  11  moves in relation  to  its  housing  the following positions arise: (a) the teeth on the rotor are in line with  the teeth on the ridges (Figure 4a), (b) the teeth  on  the rotor  are out of line, with the teeth on the ridges  (Figure  4b) and  (c) the teeth on the rotor are in positions between (a)  and (a).  Position  (a) represents the moment of maximum  shear  i.e. dispersion and maximum radial flow of the materials being mixed. Position (b) represents the moment of maximum distribution when aliquots  of  the  outward  flow of material  are  taken  off  in different directions according to whether they are in locations bounded by rotor teeth or locations bounded by housing teeth.<br>
Figure 6 shows an insert where the gaps are not aligned to give a contiguous 1inear radial path and so the path of least resistance involves annular as well as radial displacements.<br>
Figure 7 shows a rotor where the teeth not aligned to give a continuous linear radial path and so the path of least resistant involves annular as well as radial displacements.<br>
Figures 8 , 9 and 10 show the various geometries of the teeth. Referring to figures 8 to 10 it can be appreciated that the shape of the leading edge and the orientation of the individual  teeth can promote movement of the melt in  particular<br><br>
-20-<br>
directions within the mixer, which may be highly advantageous to both transport of material through the mixer and also in terms of promoting dispersive conditions such as elongation flow.<br>
Figure 8 shows a rotor tooth 82 between stator teeth 81 and B3 with the tooth centred in 8a, scrapping the outer tooth 81 in 8b, the inner stator tooth 83 in 8c and shows a positive pitch 8e of the tooth body which will push material outwards within the mixer whilst a negative pitch 8d will bring it towards the centre.<br>
Figure  9  shows  a neutral rake 9a,  positive  rake  on  the leading edge 9b which will transport material from the base of a valley  towards the rotor disc, whilst a negative rake  9c  will push  material  down  into the stator. The  arrow  indicates  the direction  of  rotation. Figure 9d and 9e show variation  in  the tooth tip.<br>
Figure 10 shows rotor tooth 101 between stator teeth 100 and 102 with a positive bevel 10c on a the leading edge which will push material outwards within the mixer whilst a negative bevel 10b will bring it towards the centre.<br>
The polymer, polymer blend or polymer/solid additive mixture is fed into the extruder via the hopper and feed port 3 and is conveyed  along  the rear barrel 5 by the rotation  of  the  rear screw  4 which is driven by an external drive not shown  via  the<br><br>
-21-<br>
coupling 1. Heat supplied via the barrel 5 causes the polymer to become liquid or at least readily deformable before reaching  the rear mixing insert 12-<br>
The mixing inserts could be integrated into the flanges of the two barrel sections but by making them removable mixing geometry and hence mixing effects can be changed by replacing the relatively inexpensive inserts rather than the entire barrel.<br>
The front 10   and the rear 12 inserts are clamped together by flanges  to form a cylindrical chamber with inlet 12a and  outlet 10a.     as shown in Figure la. The surfaces of the  mixing  inserts and  rotor  are  covered with a series  of  annular  ridges.  An example  of  this is shown in Figure 2, 22d in which  ridges  are offset  from each other so that they can  intermesh as  shown  in Figure 4. On top of the ridges are a series of teeth an example of which is shown in Figure  2, 21. The polymer melt can flow around the annular  channels- Outwards or inwards through the gaps between the  teeth  or follow a longer path over the tips of  the  teeth. Under  operating  conditions the rotational motion of  the  rotor results  in  a chaotic combination of these. The net sum  of  all these  routes takes the material up one face of the  disk  across its edges and back down the obverse.<br>
From the discharge port 10a the polymer melt is conveyed by the  front  screw  9  along the  front  barrel  and  pressure  is generated to force the melt through the discharge nozzle 8 in the die 7.<br><br>
