				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The  invention relates  to  the  technical  field, of<br>
filtration systems for swimming pools.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to the compact<br>
Water filtration units used in swimming pools. These<br>
units comprise, in a known way, a "filtration"<br>
compartment and a "pumping" compartment. The filtration<br>
compartment is designed to be submerged in the water of<br>
the swimming pool. This compartment houses one or more<br>
filtration means of any appropriate known type. The<br>
pumping compartment is situated on the outside of the<br>
swimming pool. It is usually buried, and has one or<br>
more pumps for sucking the water in and returning it,<br>
as indicated in the rest of this description. The<br>
pumping and filtration compartments are connected by a<br>
common part which usually straddles the walls of the<br>
swimming pool, whatever its specific design. This part<br>
of the overall filtration unit has the shape, very<br>
approximately, of an upside-down staple. Examples of<br>
this type of filtration unit can be found in the<br>
teachings, of patents FR 97.01642, FR 98.03790 and FR<br>
99.12856.<br>
In essence, the filtration mesns, whatever its<br>
particular design, is connected, by pipe elements, to<br>
the pump or pumps installed in the pumping compartment .<br>
More particularly, these pipe elements are connected to<br>
the suction intake of the pump. Other pipe elements are<br>
connected to the pump's return outlet. where the<br>
filtered water is returned tc the swimming pool by<br>
means of for example nozzles on a part of the<br>
filtration compartment.<br>
Clearly, the suction and return pipe systems are made<br>
up of several elements connected by elbows or the like<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
to form the connection between the riltration<br>
compartment and the suction compartment. For reasons of<br>
ease of installation and to keep costs down, these pipe<br>
elements are of round section and advantageously made<br>
of PVC, conforming with standard components as widely<br>
available in the trade. Specifically, the use of this<br>
kind of round-section pipe element keeps tests down and<br>
enables different types of connection to be made.<br>
Because of the need to make a circuit to carry the<br>
water between the filtration compartment and pumping<br>
compartment.  the suction and return pipes are also<br>
present in the common connecting part between the two<br>
compertments. In this area the suction and return pipes<br>
are usually placed side by side in a horizontal plane.<br>
As a result, these rouno-section pipes occupy a certain<br>
height, so that the common connecting part appears<br>
above the edge of the swimming pool. The same is also<br>
true of the filtration and pumping compertments.<br>
In other words, the filtration unit, as a whole, in the<br>
prior art, inust project high enough to allow the<br>
suction and return pipes to pass across. This excess<br>
height is not always very appealing to the eye and can<br>
interfere with the integration of the complete<br>
filtration unit in the. coping and areas around the<br>
pool.<br>
It is an object of the invention to solve these<br>
problems in a simple, safe, effective and efficient<br>
manner.<br>
The problem which the invention seeks to solve is how<br>
to minimise the height. of the connecting part between<br>
the filtration and pumping compartments, in such a way<br>
that the filtration unit as a whole hardly shows above<br>
the surrounding areas for example, while not increasing<br>
production costs,  in other words keeping open the<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
possibility of making the suction and return circuits<br>
largely from round-section pipe elements of the type<br>
commonly used in the trade.<br>
To solve this kind of problem, a device for connecting<br>
suction and return pipes, particularly between two<br>
compartments of a filtration unit, has been designed<br>
and developed, the said device comprising a module of<br>
thin flat cross section defining at least one<br>
open-ended internal conduit, the said conduit or<br>
conduits having membars for watertight connection with<br>
flat-section connectors, the said connectors being<br>
fixed to the suction and return pipes, and the said<br>
module being arranged between the two compartments, at<br>
the common linking part.<br>
Advantageously, in response to the problem of how to<br>
separate the suction and return circuits, the module<br>
defines, in section, two separate internal conduits,<br>
each conduit having the members for connection to the<br>
flat-section connectors, for the connection to the<br>
suction and return pipes positioned in the filtration<br>
and pumping compartments.<br>
To solve the problem of how to connect the module as a<br>
whole to the suction and return pipes, the connecting<br>
members of the module are flat, especially rectangular,<br>
section adaptors an communication with the conduits.<br>
Advantageously, the flat-section connectors are made<br>
integral, directly or by being connected, with<br>
round-section adaptors able to be connected by<br>
watertight engagement with the pipe elements of<br>
complementary section.<br>
To solve the problem of how to facilitate the<br>
installing and connection of the various suction and<br>
return pipes, without increasing costs, the module is<br>
an independent add-on element fixed in a watertight<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
manner to the common connecting part, between the two<br>
compartments.<br>
Advantageausly, the module has in section a profile<br>
able to fit in a complementary profile serving as a<br>
bearing cradle. formed in the thickness of the common<br>
connecting part.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the whole filtration<br>
unit, the module and the two compartments are connected<br>
together by a common linking frame fitted with covers<br>
for closing each of the said compartments.<br>
The invention is set out below in greater detail with<br>
the aid of the figures of the attached drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of all the elements<br>
of the connection device;<br>
Figure 2 is a transverse cross section on the<br>
plane marked 2-2 in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a cross section on the plane marked<br>
3-3 in figure 1, following connection of the<br>
corresponding pipe parts;<br>
Figure 4 is a longitudinal cross section through<br>
an example of an embodiment of a compact filtration<br>
unit equipped with the device;<br>
Figure 5 is a transverse cross section on the<br>
plane marked 5-5 in Figure 4; and<br>
Figure 6 is a diagrammatic perspective view of an<br>
example of the application of the connection device to<br>
a compact filtration unit.<br>
As will be fully familiar to those skilled in the art,<br>
this type of filtration unit essentially comprises a<br>
compartment (A) submerged in the water and known as the<br>
"filtration  compartment",  and  a  compartment  (B) ,<br>
situatad on the outside of  the swimming pool and<br>
generally known as the "pumping compartment". The two<br>
compartments (A) and (B) are connected together by a<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
common connecting part (C) to form a single block. The<br>
pumping compartment (B) is usually designed to be<br>
buried in the ground.<br>
The filtration compartment (A) comprises, as is known<br>
very well, one or more filtration means (F), which may<br>
take various forms. The pumping compartment (B) houses<br>
one or more pumps (P) for sucking the water out of the<br>
swimming pool, it having passed en route through one or<br>
more filters (F) , and returning the filtered water to<br>
the swimming pool, by means of, for example, a return<br>
nozzle (R).<br>
The swimming pool water suction and return circuit, in<br>
combination with the filtration in and pumping (P)<br>
means, essentially follows a suction pipe (1) connected<br>
to the pump (P) suction intake, and a return pipe (2)<br>
connected to the pump (P) return outlet. The pipes (1)<br>
and (2) are largely made up of round-section elements<br>
of the type widely sold in the trade and their diameter<br>
is determined as a function of the flowrate.<br>
According to the invention, the problem addressed by<br>
the invention, as indicated, is haw to minimize the<br>
height of the common connecting part (C) between the<br>
compartments (A) and (B), emphasizing that this common<br>
connecting part (C) usually has, either directly or by<br>
an  attachment,  members  (3)   for  the  watertight<br>
separation of the two compartments (A) and (B) , notably<br>
in order to avoid any risk of the water filling the<br>
filtration compartment and spilling over into the<br>
pumping compartment. Such members are thoroughly<br>
familiar to those skilled in the art, as can be seen<br>
for example by the teaching of the patents cited<br>
earlier.<br>
Given this configuration, therefore, it can be seen<br>
that  the  sucticn  (1)  and  return  (2)  pipes  are<br>
constructed in the form of two parts or assemblies (la,<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
1b) and (2a, 2b). Part (la) of the suction pipe is<br>
situated in the filtration compartment, while part (1b)<br>
is situated in the pumping compartment . In the same<br>
way, part (2a) of the return pipe is situated in the<br>
filtration compartment, while part (2b) is situated in<br>
the pumping compartment,<br>
It is important therefore to connect up the two parts<br>
(la) and (lb) on the one hand, and (2a) and (2b) on the<br>
other, as they negotiate the members (3), within the<br>
smallest height possible, as indicated.<br>
According to the invention, the device for connecting<br>
the suction (la, 1b) and return (2a, 2b) conduit parts<br>
has connecting members than are thinner than the<br>
diameter of the various pipe elements (1) and (2).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the connecting device,<br>
denoted as a whole by (4) comprises a module of flat<br>
transverse section, with a thickness (e) that is less<br>
than the diameter (d) of the component elements of the<br>
pipes (1) and (2). This module is hollow and defines,<br>
in section, at least one, but preferably two internal<br>
and separate conduits (4a) and (4b). On either side of<br>
the body Of the module (4), the conduits (4a) and (4b)<br>
have membecs (4c) aud (4d) for watertight connection to<br>
the flat-section connectors (5) . The conriectors (5) are<br>
fixed in a watertight manner, by any appropriate known<br>
means, to the parts (1a) and (1b) of the suction pipe<br>
and to the parts (2a) and (2b) of the return pipe.<br>
The members (4c) and (4d) of the module (4) are flat,<br>
especially   rectangular;    section   adaptors   in<br>
communication with the conduits (4a) and (4b), and on<br>
which the complementary-section connectors (5) can be<br>
engaged.<br>
Advantageously,  the  flat-section  connectors  (5)  are<br>
made integral, directly or by being connected, with<br>
- 7  -<br><br>
round-section adaptors (5a) able to be connected by<br>
watertight engagement with the corresponding parts of<br>
the pipes (la, 1b) and (2a, 2b) (Figure 1).<br>
The module (9) is an independent add-on element fixed<br>
in a watertight manner in the common connecting part<br>
(C) between the two compartments (A) and (B). More<br>
specifically, the module (4) has in section a profile<br>
able to fit in a complementary profile (3a) serving as<br>
a bearing cradle formed in the thickness of a<br>
watertight separating partition (3). It may be fixed,<br>
for example, by means of screws (6) in combination with<br>
a seal (7) placed in the bottom of the bearing cradle<br>
Note  that  in  one  particular  embodiment  of  the<br>
filtration unit, the module (4) and the two<br>
compartments (A) and (B) are connected together by a<br>
common linking frame (net shown) fitted with covers for<br>
closing each of the said compartments.<br>
Because the connecting module (A) and the corresponding<br>
connectors (5) are so low, it is possible to minimize<br>
the height of the common linking part (C) , in such a<br>
way that the complete filtration unit, once installed<br>
in a straddling position sitting on the corresponding<br>
edge of the swimming pool, rises above it by only a<br>
small height which is at the very most less than the<br>
height generally accepted when using round-section<br>
piping through the common linking part.<br>
Clearly, the dimensions of the connecting adaptors (4c)<br>
and of the corresponding connectors (5) are suitably<br>
for the desired flowrate. As a guide, if using 75-mm<br>
diameter pipe elements, the connecting adaptors (4c)<br>
and (4d) and the connectors (5) may have a thickness of<br>
approximately 25 rum while pointing out that this<br>
thickness may be further reduced if the width is<br>
increased in order to give an equivalent cross section<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
so as to suit the flowrate.<br>
The Advantages will be obvious front the description.<br>
