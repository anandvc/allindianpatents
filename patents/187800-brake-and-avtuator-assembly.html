BRAKE AND ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY<br>
This invention relates to a brake and actuator assembly, primarily for a motor vehicle, of the general kind comprising a brake incorporating a shaft operable, in use, to cause friction elements of the brake to be urged against a rotary braking member, and coupling means between the shaft and a power device for operating the brake.<br>
In mechanically actuated reaction type disc brakes, which include a caliper member associated with a rotary shaft and movable relative to a fixed carrier, wear of the friction linings takes place in a direction which is generally longitudinally of the shaft.   It is usual for the brake to include adjuster means which compensates for friction lining wear, thereby keeping the rotational operative movement of the shaft to a minimum. Furthermore, wear of the friction linings is accompanied by a displacement of the caliper member and shaft relative to the fixed carrier. This displacement may be typically 20mm from the new to the fully worn lining condition.  Various proposals have been made to accommodate this displacement, such as incorporating a splined connection between components of the mechanism to provide for their relative movement in the shaft longitudinal direction.   In some prior arrangements of this type incorporating additional components, further splined connections or other mechanisms are required, leading to complication and high manufacturing costs.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an improved brake and actuator assembly which is simpler and more cost effective than the aforesaid prior art arrangements.<br><br>
2<br>
According to the invention, the coupling means includes a splined connection between the shaft and the power device, whereby the position of force application from the power device to the shaft may vary to accommodate friction lining wear in the brake, in use.<br>
Conveniently, the shaft is formed with splines, typically on one end portion thereof, forming part of the splined connection.<br>
Preferably, the coupling means includes a hollow circular rotatably mounted boss formed with internal splines complementary to and engaged with those on the shaft, the boss being conveniently rotatably mounted in a housing by way of bearing means and, typically, carrying an operating lever connectable to the power device.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of one form of vehicle disc brake incorporating the actuator assembly of the invention, and<br>
Figure 2 is a view from above, partly in cross-section, of part of the brake actuator assembly shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings illustrates one form of disc brake, illustrated generally at 1, of which a carrier 2 is secured by bolts 3 to an end flange 4 of a vehicle axle 5.   The carrier 2 supports a pair of friction pad assemblies 6A, 6B in conventional manner at either side of a rotatable brake disc 7 associated in use with a wheel to be braked (not shown). The brake also includes a caliper 8 slidably mounted on pins 9 and<br><br>
3<br>
incorporating a brake-actuating mechanism of conventional type, such as a ball and ramp or helical ramp arrangement, of which an adjustable tappet cooperates, usually by way of a spreader plate, with the adjacent directly actuated pad assembly 6A, the other pad assembly being operated indirectly by sliding of the caliper along the pins 9, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
Motive power for brake actuation is provided by an air actuator 10 of conventional type, of which an output rod 11 is coupled, via an input lever 12, to a force input shaft 13, for which a bearing at the brake end thereof is provided within a housing 14 secured by bolts 15 to the caliper 8.  The outer end of the shaft 13 is rotatably mounted in brackets 16A, 16B rigidly secured to the axle 5, as by illustrated bolts 16C.<br>
As can be seen more clearly from Figure 2, the lever 12 is integral with a circular boss 17 which is mounted by way of bearings, typically of plastics, brass or sintered material and illustrated as spherical radial bearings 18, within a housing formed by the brackets 16A, 16B.  The bearings are housed within curved radially extreme portions 19 of the brackets and planar opposed respective surfaces 18A thereof are engaged against opposed axially facing sides of the boss 17,  The aforesaid surfaces of the boss are formed with respective identical annular flanges 20, the radially outermost surfaces or shoulders of which bear against the adjacent internal surfaces 18B of the bearings 18.   The lever is thereby constrained radially and axially whilst permitted rotational actuating movement under the action oi the power device 10.<br>
The adjacent end portion of the shaft 13 is provided with longitudinal splines 21 which engage corresponding splines within the boss 17 in<br><br>
4<br>
order to provide a rotary driving connection between the lever 12 and shaft whilst at the sanne time permitting axial movement of the shaft within the boss.  The outermost end of the shaft is covered by a cap 22, conveniently of pressed metal, which is held in place on the boss 17 by a circlip 23 engaged in a groove in the adjacent annular flange 20 and trapping a radial flange of the cap against the boss.  A similar circlip 24 at the opposite side of the boss 17 traps a flange of a tubular element 25, conveniently of pressed metal, which acts to support one end of a protective boot 26, the other end of which engages around the shaft 13. Both the boot 26 and cap 22 serve to minimise the ingress to the sensitive sliding spline connection of foreign material, such as dust and water.  The boss 17 is provided, at a location radially remote from the lever 12, with a nipple 17 permitting lubricating grease to be introduced along a passage 28 of the boss into the splines 21.<br>
Rotation of the lever 12 by actuation of the power device 10 will in turn rotate the shaft 13 which operates the brake actuating mechanism within the brake in order to apply the friction pad assemblies 6A, 6B against the disc 7, in conventional manner.  A certain amount of deflection may take place in the brake components during actuation, leading to an angular deflection of the shaft which is amplified at the splined end thereof.  This deflection can either be accommodated in the splined connection with the lever or by the spherical bearings 18.<br>
As wear of the friction pad assemblies takes place, the shaft 13 moves axially together with the caliper 8 in the direction of arrow A in Figures 1 and 2.  This movement is permitted by way of the splined connection between the shaft and the boss 17 of the actuating lever.  The formation of the splined connection at this location leads to an advantageous<br><br>
5<br>
simplicity of construction, avoiding the use oi an additional coupling along the shaft or within the actuating mechanism of the brake.<br>
It is possible with the actuator assembly of the invention to provide for the interchangeability of cam-actuated drum brakes with the disc brake illustrated and described herein.  The rotary actuator shaft mounted on such a drum brake enables the brake to be Installed in place of the disc brake with the actuator shaft connected to the lever 12 by complementary splines, even though substantial axial displacement of the shaft may not be required.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to a brake and actuator assembly, primarily for a motor vehicle,  of the general kind comprising a brake  incorporating a  shaft operable,   in use,   to cause friction elements of  the brake  to be  urged  against a   rotary braking member,   and  coupling means between the   shaft and  a power device  for operating  the brake.<br>
In mechanically actuated   reaction type disc brakes,  which include  a caliper member associated with a  rotary  shaft and movable   relative  to a  fixed  carrier,   wear of the  friction linings takes place   in a direction which  is generally  longiÂ¬tudinally of  the   shaft.   It is  usual  for the brake  to  include adjuster means which compensates for friction  lining wear, thereby keeping  the   rotational operative movement of  the   shaft to a minimum.   Furthermore,   wear of  the  friction  linings  is accompanied by a displacement of  the  caliper member and   shaft relative  to the  fixed  carrier.   This displacement may be  typiÂ¬cally 20mm from the  new to  the  fully worn lining  condition. Various proposals have been made  to accommodate   this disÂ¬placement,   such  as  incorporating a   splined connection between components of  the mechanism to provide  for  their relative movement  in  the   shaft longitudinal direction.   In some prior arrangements of  this type   incorporating additional components,   further splined  connections or other mechanisms are  required,   leading to complication and  high manufacturing costs.<br>
one   such prior arrangement is  illustrated   in GB-A-1519980  and includes a brake-actuating  shaft forming a   splined connection<br>
  with a  further shaft extending  into operative engagement with a  slack      adjuster       interposed     between     this  further shaft and  an actuating  rod  of a power device.<br><br>
us No,4014411 illustrates a further arrangement in which a splined connection is provided between a brake actuating shaft and a lever connected  to an actuator device.<br>
An object of  the   invention is to provide  an  improved brake  and actuator assembly which  is  simpler and  has  improved  operating characteristics as compared with  the aforesaid  prior art arrangements.<br>
According  to  the  invention,   a brake  and  actuator assembly comprises  a brake   incorporating a  shaft operable,   in use,   to cause  friction elements of  the  brake  to be  urged  against a rotary braking member,   the  shaft being operably connected  to a brake-actuating mechanism of  the  brake  for brake  actuation and,   at a   location  spaced   from  said mechanism,   forming a splined  connection with a coupling device  coupled   to an output member of  a power device,  whereby  the position of  force application from  the power device  via  the  coupling device  to the  shaft may vary along  the  shaft to accommodate  friction lining wear  in  the  brake,   in use,   the  coupling device   including a  hollow  rotatably mounted  boss formed with  internal  splines complementary  to and engaged with  splines on the  shaft to form said  splined connection,   a circular part of  the  boss being rotatably mounted   in a  housing by way of bearing means.<br>
The   invention will now be described,  by way of example,  with reference   to  the  accompanying drawings,   in which:-<br><br>
Figure  1  is a perspective view of one  form of vehicle disc brake incorporating  the  actuator assembly of  thei  invention,   and<br>
Figure  2  is a view from above,  partly in Cross-section,   of part of  the  brake  actuator assembly   shown  in Figure   1.<br>
Figure  1 of  the drawings  illustrates one  form of disc brake, illustrated  generally  at 1,   of which a  carrier 2   is secured by bolts  3 to an end   flange  4  of  a  vehicle  axle   5.     The  carrier 2  supports a pair of  friction pad  assemblies 6A,   6B   in conÂ¬ventional manner at either side  of a  rotatable  brake  disc  7 associated  in use with a wheel  to be braked   (not shown) .  The brake  also  includes a  caliper  8  slidably mounted  on pins  9  and<br><br>
incorporating a brake-actuating mechanism of conventional  type,such as a ball  and   ramp or helical  ramp arrangement,   of which an adjustaÂ¬ble  tappet co-operates,   usually by way of a   spreader plate,  with  the adjacent directly actuated  pad  assembly 6A,   the   other pad  assembly being  operated  indirectly by sliding of  the  caliper along the pins 9,   as  will be  understood by those   skilled   in  the  art.<br>
Motive power for brake  actuation  is provided by an air actuator 10 of  conventional  type,   of which an output rod   11   is coupled,   via  an input  lever  12,   to  a  force   input  shaft 13,   for which a  bearing at the  brake  end   thereof  is provided within a housing   14   secured by bolts  15  to  the  caliper 8.     The  outer end  of  the   shaft 13  is rotatably mounted  in brackets  16A,   16B  rigidly  secured   to the axle   5, as  by  illustrated  bolts  16C<br>
As can be   seen more  clearly from Figure   2,   the   lever  12  is  integral with a  circular boss  17 which  is mounted  by way of bearings, typically of plastics,   brass or sintered material  and   Illustrated as  spherical  radial bearings  18,   within a housing   formed by  the brackets  16A,   16B.   The  bearings are  housed within curved  radially extreme  portions  19 of  the  brackets and  planar opposed   respective surfaces  18A   thereof are engaged  against opposed  axially facing sides of  the  boss  17.   The  aforesaid  surfaces of  the  boss are  formed with  respective  identical  annular flanges  20,   the   radially outerÂ¬most surfaces or  shoulders of which bear against  the  adjacent internal  surfaces  18B  of  the  bearings  18.     The   lever  is  thereby constrained   radially and  axially whilst permitted   rotational actuating movement under the  action of  the power device   10.<br>
The  adjacent end  portion of the   shaft 13  is provided  with  longitudine   21 which engage corresponding  splines within  the boss  17  in<br><br>
order to provide  a rotary driving connection between the  lever  12 and shaft whilst at the   same   time permitting axial movement of  the   shaft within the boss.  The  outermost end  of  the  shaft  is covered by a cap 22,   conveniently  of  pressed  metal,   which  is  held   in place   on  the boss  17 by a circlip  23 engaged  in a  groove  in  the  adjacent annular flange  20  and   trapping  a   radial flange of  the  cap against the boss. A   similar circlip  24  at the  opposite   side  of  the boss  17  traps a flange  of  a  tubular element  25,   conveniently of  pressed metal,which acts to  support one end  of a protective boot 26,   the  other end  of which engages around   the   shaft  13.     Both  the  boot  26  and   cap  22 serve  to minimise  the  ingress  to  the   sensitive   sliding   spline  connÂ¬ection of foreign material,   such as dust and water.  The boss  17  is provided,   at a  location radially  remote  from the  lever 12,   with  a nipple  27 permitting  lubricating  grease  to be  introduced  along a passage  28 of  the  boss  into the   splines  21.<br>
Rotation of  the   lever 12  by actuation of  the power device  10 will  in turn rotate  the   shaft 13 which operates  the brake  actuating mechanisi within the brake   in order to apply  the  friction pad  assemblies 6A, 6B against the disc  7,   in conventional manner.  A  certain amount of deflection may  take place   in  the  brake  components during actuation, leading to an angular deflection of   the  shaft which  is amplified  at the   splined  end   thereof.     This deflection can either be  accommodated in  the  splined  connection with  the   lever or by  the  spherical bearings  IB,<br>
As wear of  the  friction pad  assemblies  takes place,   the  shaft  13 moves axially together with  the  caliper 8  in  the  direction of  arrow A   in Figures  1  and   2,  This movement  is permitted  by way of   the splined connection between  the   shaft and  the boss  17  of  the  actuatin lever,The  formation of  the, splined  connection at this  location<br><br>
leads  to an advantageous  simplicity of construction,   avoiding the use  of an additional coupling along the   shaft or within the actuating mechanism of  the brake.<br>
It is possible  with  the actuator assembly of   the   invention  to provide  for  the  interchangeability of cam-actuated drum brakes with  the disc  brake   illustrated  and  described  herein.    The  rotary actuator shaft mounted  on  such a drum brake  enables  the  brake  to be   installed  in place  of  the disc brake  with  the  actuator shaft connected  to  the   lever 12 by complementary  splines,   even though substantial  axial displacement of the  shaft may  not be  required<br><br>
