				<td>A METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF A DIHYDROTAGETONE ALCOHOL FROM TAGETES MINUTA OIL Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of a dihydrotagetone alcohol from from Tagetes minuta oil. More particularly the present invention relates to the preparation of dihydrotagetone methyl alcohol (3,5,7 trimethyl 1-ene, 5-octanol) and dihydrotagetone benzyl alcohol (3,7-dimethyl 5-benzyl, 1-ene, 5- octanol) by chemical transformation of dihydrotagetone present in essential oil of Tagetes mimita. Background of the invention<br>
Dihydrotagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5-one, 1-octene) find application as perfumery and flavouring material. The synthesised molecules also find application as perfumery and flavour products or as an ingredient of perfumery and flavour products. Dihydrotagetone, dihydrotagetone methyl alcohol and dihydrotagetone benzyl alcohol are also useful in the pharmaceutical industry apart from the flavour and perfumery industries.<br>
Derivatives of the above like acetates, epoxides, peroxides, acids, amides, halides, ethers and oximes etc. also result in products for perfumery, flavour and pharmaceutical industries.<br>
Tagetes is a genus of herbs, commonly known as MARIGOLD, originally a native of Mexico and other warmer parts of America has now naturalised elsewhere in the tropics and sub-tropics. Several species have been introduced in India. Some of them are Tagetes patula, Tagetes erecta, Tagetes minuta, Tagetes lucida and Tagetes tenuifolia. The flower heads are used for garlands. Many Tagetes species yield strongly aromatic essential oils, all of which are known as Tagetes oil. The oil is obtained from the aerial parts of the plant by steam distillation or by extracting in petroleum- ether or benzene. Prolonged distillation spoils the aroma. The leaves, especially the tender ones and flower heads are rich in oil.<br>
Tagetes minutaLinn. syn. Tagetes glandulijera Schrank (family- Compositae) is a highly aromatic annual, 1-2 m tall, native to South America, has naturalised near the waste places and on dry embankments in the North-West Himalayas between altitudes of 1250 and 2500 m.<br>
Among all the Tagetes species grown in India, Tagetes minuta appears to give the highest yield of the essential oil with maximum carbonyl content, calculated as tagetone. Reference may be made to Villeirs F. J., Garbers C. F and Lasnvie R. N., 1971, synthesis of Tagetones and their occurrence in oil of Tagetes minuta, Phytochemistry, 10, 1359. Reference may also be made to Lawrence B. M., 1992, progress in essential oils, Per/ &amp; Flav, 17, 131-<br>
132. Another reference may be made to Singh B., Sood R.P and Singh V. 1992, chemical<br>
composition of Tagetes Minuta L. from Himachal Pradesh (India), J., Essent. Oil Res.4,525.<br>

Accordingly,   the   present   invention   provides   a   method   for   preparation   of dihydrotagetone alcohols from Tagetes Minuta oil of the general formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula 1<br>
wherein R=alkyl or aryl group said process comprising<br>
i)        solvent-solvent   partitioning   of   Tagetes   Minuta   oil   as   herein<br>
described ii)       evaporating  solvent and  isolating  dihydrotagetone  as  herein<br>
described iii)      characterized in that reacting the dihydrotagetone so isolated in<br>
step (ii) above with a Grignard reagent in a known manner iv)      extracting the resultant mixture of step (iii) with a polar solvent as<br>
herein described, and v)       evaporating and drying the solvent by known methods to obtain<br>
dihydrogetone alcohol.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the solvent for partitioning is selected from the group consisting of n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and acetonitrile. In  another  embodiment  of the  invention,   dihydrotagetone  is  converted   into dihydrotagetone alcohols with a yield ranging from 75% - 99%. In a further embodiment of the invention the dihydrotagetone alcohols formed are dihydrotagetone methyl alcohol (3,5,7-trimethyl, 1-ene, 5-octanol), dihydrotagetone benzyl alcohol (3,7-dimethyl, 5-benzyl, 1-ene, 5-octanol) and other dihydrotagetone alcohol derivatives selected from ethyl, butyl, propyl, and phenyl alcohols.<br>
In another embodiment of present invention Tagetes minuta oil was obtained by hydro -steam distillation in laboratory/pilot scale.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, dihydrotagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5-one, 1-octene) is converted to 3,5,7 trimethyl l-ene-5-octanol and 3,7-dimethyl, 5-benzyl, 1-ene-5-octanol by Grignard reaction, comprising first preparing Grignard reagent using magnesium turnings in diethyl ether and dropwise addition of alkyl or aryl halide at 0°C with continues stirring on magnetic stirrer, adding dihydrotagetone to the above prepared Grignard reagent dropwise with continues stirring. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Dihydrotagetone and two other molecules synthesised from it were evaluated for their odour profiles.<br>
Dihydrotagetone is converted to alkyl and aryl alcohols by easy, convenient and in good yields. These alcohols could not be prepared by alkyl and aryllithium and alkyzinc reagents but in low yields. Lithium dimethyl copper reacts with aldehyde and ketones to give expected alcohols. Aromatic aldehydes and ketones can be alkylated and reduced in one reaction vessel by treatment with an alkyl and aryllithium. The reference may be made to Furakawa and Kawabata, Adv. Organomet. Chem. 12 103-112, 1974. The other reference may be made to House, Prabhu, Wilkins and Lee., J. Org. Chem., 41, 3067, 1976. Yet another reference may be made to Hall &amp; Lipsky, J. Org. Chem., 38, 1735,1973.<br>
Tagetes minuta plant grown in the farms of the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology was subjected to hydrodistillation / hydrosteam distillation on pilot plant for four to five hours. After the distillation is completed, the oil is separated and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and then kept in amber colored bottles without leaving any air gap. After that, the oil was subjected to fractionation through solvent - solvent extraction with n-pentane (w-hexane may be taken in place of n-pentane) and acetonitrile for enrichment of monoterpene and ketones and solvent evaporation. The acetonitrile fraction was subjected to the column chromatography on silica gel and eluted initially with «-hexane and then increased order of polarity with ethyl acetate upto 2%. Dihydrotagetone got eluted with 2% ethyl acetate. Synthesis of dihydrotagetone methyl alcohol<br>
The Grignard reagent was prepared with methyl iodide and magnesium in dry ether and iodine was used as a catalyst to start the reaction Then dihydrotagetone was added drop-wise to this with continuous stirring at 0°C for two hours. The reaction was monitored on TLC and the final purity of the product was confirmed by GC, GC-MS, IR, 1H &amp; 13C NMR.<br>
Synthesis of dihydrotagetone benzyl alcohol<br>
The Grignard reagent was prepared with benzyl chloride and magnesium in dry ether and iodine was used as a catalyst to initiate the reaction. To this Dihydrotagetone was added drop-wise with continuous stirring at 0°C for two hours. The reaction was monitored on TLC and the final purity of the product was confirmed by GC, GC-MS, IR, 1H &amp; 13C NMR.<br>
A comparative statement of Tagetes oil and its components have been made with respect to the different characteristic. Tagetes oil<br>
It is reddish yellow mobile and clear liquid which has a powerful pungent low reminiscent of rancid butter, spearmint and in great dilutions of apples. The oil is reported to have Specific gravity 0.8405-0.8457,refractive index 1.4809-1.4905, optical rotation +2-+10 at 27°C .<br>
On exposure to air and light, the oil has tendency to polymerize and become an almost solid gel. Ocimene (3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6 octatriene)<br>
It is colorless or very pale straw colour mobile liquid with sp. 0.80 and boiling point 177° C. It is insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol.  It polymerizes quickly when exposed to air oxygen.  It is warm-herbaceous, very diffusive odour of poor tenacity.  The sweetness is almost floral and there is immediate similarity to neroli oil. Cis-tagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5- one, 1,3-octdiene)<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1:<br>
In 350 ml of Tagetes mimita oil, 250 ml of acetonitrile and 250 ml of n-pentane were added and mixture was shaken slowly in separating funnel. This was allowed to stand for half an hour. After separating two layers, the acetonitrile layer was washed three times with n- pentane (250 ml each), the pentane fractions were combined and the solvent evaporated i.e. w-pentane from pentane fraction &amp; acetonitrile from acetonitrile fraction. After analysing both the fractions by Gas Chromatographic technique, following percentages of ocimene (hydrocarbon) and dihydrotagetone (ketone) were observed. The freshly distilled Tagetes minnta oil contained ocimene 54.97%, and dihydrotagetone 32.58%.<br>
1.	Pentane fraction         :	Ocimene 62.5 %,    Dihydrotagetone 24.62 %.<br>
2.	Acetonitrile fraction :	Ocimene 26.96 %,   Dihydrotagetone 69.87 %.<br>
The enrichment of Dihydrotagetone was achieved from 32.5%, present in freshly distilled oil to nearly 70% after partitioning.<br>
The acetonitrile fraction was subjected to the column chromatography on Silica gel (60-120 mesh), run initially with w-hexane and then with an increasing order of polarity with ethyl acetate upto 2% to get pure dihydrotagetone. Confirmation of dihydrotagetone was made by various analytical techniques like - IR, GC, GC-MS, 1H &amp; 13C NMR spectroscopy and the odour profile was checked.<br>

2.        Isolation and identification of dihydrotagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5-one,  1-octene) a<br>
constituent of Tagetes minuta oil as a new perfumery and flavouring material having<br>
fresh, sweet, fruity flowery, light tagetes and .green. 3         Use of dihydrotagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5-one, 1-octene) as a starting material for the<br>
development of two new aroma molecules.<br>
4.	Chemical transformation of dihydrotagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5-one, 1-octene) into its<br>
dihydrotagetone methyl alcohol (3,5,7-trimeihyl, l-ene-5-octanol) derivative in 99%<br>
yield with minty, spicy and fresh fruity aroma note.<br>
5.	Chemical transformation of dihydrotagetone (3,7-dimethyl, 5-one, 1-octene) into its<br>
dihydrotagetone benzyl alcohol (3,7-dimethyl, 5-benzyl,l-ene-5-octanol) 75% yield<br>
with sweet, flowery and aromatic aroma note;<br>
6.	The new aroma molecules useful in in perfumery flavouring and pharmaceutical<br>
industry can be prepared cost effectively by easy and convenient process from<br>
dihydrotagetone.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
