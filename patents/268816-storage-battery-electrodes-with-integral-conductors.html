Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates generally to the structure of electrochemical storage<br>
batteries, and more particularly, to a novel and improved electrode plate for such<br>
batteries.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Typically, storage batteries of the electrochemical type have one or more<br>
cells which include a plurality of first electrodes of one polarity interleaved in a spaced<br>
apart manner with a plurality of second electrodes of the opposite polarity. Separate<br>
terminals interconnect the electrodes of each polarity, usually to a terminal post, so that<br>
two terminals of opposite polarity are provided for each cell.<br>
[0003] U. S. Patent No. 5,158,842 discloses the basic structure of a storage<br>
battery having a plurality of interleaved electrode plates of opposite polarities. Each<br>
of the plates has a generally rectangular main section that forms an active region of the<br>
electrode with a tab projecting outward from one corner of the main section. The tabs<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2007/061624	PCT/US2006/043346<br>
of the electrode plates of one polarity are aligned along one side of the battery, while<br>
the tabs on the opposite polarity plates are aligned on the other side of the battery. The<br>
respective tabs of the plates of the same polarity are electrically connected, such as by<br>
welding, to the body of a terminal that has a connection post.<br>
[0004] One type of electrode plate comprised a flexible fiber plaque that was suitable<br>
for active material loaded electrodes, such as used in nickel-cadmium and nickel-iron<br>
battery systems. A common fibrous plaque was made of compacted, intermingled fine<br>
fibers reactively diffused with nickel by conventional plating processes. Prior batteries<br>
had plaques that often were formed by conductive fibers, such as iron wool, however<br>
non-conductive fibers also were used. The fibers were randomly oriented in the length,<br>
width and thickness directions of the plaque and are diffusion bonded with nickel at<br>
their contact points. The resultant electrode had pores into which the active material of<br>
the battery was introduced during subsequent assembly steps.<br>
[0005] As shown in Figure 1, a typical previous electrode 10 was rectangular - having<br>
one edge that was significantly greater than another orthogonal edge. The electrode 10<br>
has a sheet-like body 11 comprising a main, or active, region 12 and a tab 16. The main<br>
region 12 had a uniform electrical conductivity. The tab 16 projected from the longer<br>
edge of the main section 12 and due to the electroplating process that tab had a portion 14<br>
with greater density of metal. That portion 14 enabled a metal contact tab 18 to be welded<br>
to the electrode body 11. In the final battery, a battery terminal was welded or otherwise<br>
electrically connected to the contact tabs 18 of the electrodes 10 of the same polarity,<br>
thereby connecting those electrodes together.<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2007/061624	PCT/US2006/043346<br>
[0006] Certain battery installations dictated that the terminals be placed along the<br>
shorter edge of the electrode with the edge extending perpendicularly there from having<br>
a significantly greater length. However, it was discovered that in this orientation the<br>
effective resistance in the portion of the electrode remote from the tab was significantly<br>
greater than the portion of the electrode adjacent the tab. Thus, the more distant portion<br>
of the electrode was less effective than the portion closer to the tab.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The present invention provides a novel and improved battery cell and<br>
electrodes for that cell.<br>
[0008] The battery cell is formed by a plurality of first electrodes of one polarity<br>
interleaved with a plurality of second electrodes of an opposite polarity. Each of the<br>
first and second electrodes comprises a sheet of non-woven fabric having a first edge<br>
from which a portion of the non-woven fabric projects forming a tab, and having a<br>
second edge that is transverse to and preferably substantially longer than the first edge.<br>
The non-woven fabric has metal deposited thereon in a manner that forms a strip along<br>
the second edge which has a greater electrical conductivity than metal plated areas of<br>
the sheet that are remote from the second edge. This strip continues to extend along<br>
the tab.<br>
[0009] A first terminal is attached to the tabs of the first electrodes in electrical<br>
contact with the strip along each tab. A second terminal is attached in electrical<br>
contact with the strip along the tabs on the second electrodes.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2007/061624	PCT/US2006/043346<br>
[0010] In a preferred embodiment, the non-woven fabric is a needle punched felt<br>
made of polypropylene fibers. The needle punched felt is coated with the metal.<br>
Preferably, the non-woven fabric is electroplated with the metal, wherein a greater<br>
density of the metal is deposited along the second edge.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011] FIGURE 1 is a plane view of an electrode plate from a previous battery;<br>
[0012] FIGURE 2 is a cutaway perspective view of a battery containing unique<br>
electrodes according to the present invention; and<br>
[0013] FIGURE 3 is a perspective view of one of those electrodes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] With initial reference to Figure 2, a battery 20 according to the present<br>
invention has a single cell 22, however it should be understood that the present concepts<br>
can be utilized in multiple cell batteries. The battery cell 22 comprises a plurality of<br>
interleaved first and second electrodes 24 and 26 contained within a housing 28. The<br>
first and second electrodes 24 and 26 have opposite electrical polarities and the number<br>
of them varies as is necessary to provide the desired capacity of the battery 20. The<br>
electrodes 24 and 26 are interleaved in a parallel, spaced apart configuration. An active<br>
material of the battery is placed into the pores of the electrodes.<br>
[0015] When referenced to Figure 3 each of the first and second electrodes 24 and<br>
26 is formed from a sheet of a non-woven material, such as needle punched felt made<br>
of polypropylene fibers. Needle punched fabrics are well known for a variety of uses<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2007/061624	PCT/US2006/043346<br>
and are made by initially carding selected fibers into a web which then is layered up<br>
to a desired required thickness. The resultant web is passed through a needle bed that<br>
comprises thousands of barbed needles set in a plate which goes up and down with<br>
respect to the web. That action pushes the needles through the fibers which has the<br>
effect of entangling the fibers. The web then is calendered to achieve the final thickness.<br>
[0016] Fabrication of both types of electrodes 24 and 26 from the non-woven web<br>
material initially involves electroless plating the material with metal, such as nickel,<br>
which results in relatively thin metal coating on the web fibers. With a conductive<br>
coating on the fibers, the material then is electroplated to increase the thickness of the<br>
metal. For example, the needle punched felt web can be provided in a long roll from<br>
which numerous individual electrodes 24 and 26 are later cut. After the electroless<br>
plating, the web material is unwound from the roll and fed through an electroplating<br>
apparatus. The electroplating provides a rather uniformly dense metal coating on the<br>
major portion of the web, however the metal coating along the edges has a greater<br>
density than elsewhere. Therefore, the edge regions have a higher electrical conductivity.<br>
[0017] The metal coated felt material then is impregnated with a metal consistent<br>
with the type of battery in which the electrode will be used. In a nickel-cadmium battery<br>
system, for example, cadmium is embedded into the pores of a felt web for the negative,<br>
first electrodes 24; and additional nickel is embedded in the pores of another felt web<br>
for the positive, second electrodes 26. However, a skilled artisan will recognize that<br>
different metals are employed to form other types of batteries.<br>
[0018] After the metal has been deposited on the non-woven felt, individual<br>
electrodes are punched or otherwise cut from the material. This process produces an<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2007/061624	PCT/US2006/043346<br>
electrode having a large porous surface area. With continuing reference to Figure 3,<br>
each electrode 30 thereby comprises a generally rectangular sheet 31 of the non-woven,<br>
metal plated material, however a sheet of another shape may be created. The sheet 31<br>
has a first edge 32 extending along its narrower dimension and has a longer second edge ^ *<br>
34 perpendicular to the first edge 32. A tab 36 projects outwardly from the first edge 32<br>
at a corner where the first and second edges would otherwise intersect and the second<br>
edge 34 continues to extend along the tab. In forming the individual electrodes 30 from<br>
the larger body that was electroplated, the region with the greater density metal coated<br>
fibers forms a strip 38 along the second edge 34 of the electrode sheet 31. That strip 38<br>
extends the entire length along the second edge including the tab 36. This strip 38 acts<br>
as a conductor linking the tab 36 to the active remote regions of the electrode thereby<br>
providing better utilization of the active material over the entire surface area of the<br>
electrode.<br>
[0019] This process produces a plurality of the first and second electrodes 24 and<br>
26 that then are assembled into the battery cell 22 by interleaving the two types of<br>
electrodes as seen in Figure 2. In this assembly, the tabs 36 of the first electrodes<br>
24 oriented along one side while the tabs 36 on the second electrodes 26 are oriented<br>
along the opposite side. A negative, first electrical terminal 40 is inserted between two<br>
adjacent first electrodes 24 in the middle of the electrode assembly, and the tabs 36 of<br>
first electrodes 24 are bent inward against each other and against opposite side surfaces<br>
of a first electrical terminal 40. Therefore, the upper sections of the tabs 36 on adjacent<br>
first electrodes are abutting and one tab on each side abuts the first electrical terminal<br>
40. While being held in this position those tabs 36 are welded to one another and to the<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2007/061624	PCT/US2006/043346<br>
first terminal 40. Specifically the more densely metalized strip 38 on each tab provides<br>
a surface for welding to the terminal. A positive, second electrical terminal 42 is<br>
connected to the tabs 36 on the second electrodes 26 in the same manner as described<br>
with respect to the first terminal 40. Other techniques for electrically connecting the<br>
tabs 36 of the two electrodes 24 and 26 to the respective terminal 40 or 42, such as<br>
brazing or mechanical fastening by a bolt for example, can be employed..<br>
[0020] The sub-assembly of the plurality of first and second electrodes 24 and 26<br>
and the two terminals 40 and 42 then is placed into the housing 28, which is sealed so<br>
that only the upper portion of each terminal projects through the housing.<br>
[0021] The foregoing description was primarily directed to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention. Although some attention was given to various alternatives within the<br>
scope of the invention, it is anticipated that one skilled in the art will likely realize<br>
additional alternatives that are now apparent from disclosure of embodiments of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined from the<br>
following claims and not limited by the above disclosure.<br>
