				<td>[DETAILED DRSrRTPTTDM HP THE<br>
Technical Fiold of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a combined<br>
structure of a step plate and a floor skirt in a scooter<br>
type two- wheeled motor vehicle.<br>
As a combined structure of a step plate and a floor skirt there is known, for example, "a side visor device for a two-wheeled motor vehicle" which is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication.<br>
In Fig. 11 of the above publication relating to the prior art there is illustrated a scooter type two-wheeled motor vehicle having a floor 9 (the reference numeral is as<br><br>
described in the above publication and this will also true in the following) as a step plate for the driver to step thereon and a side panel (corresponding to a floor skirt) 4 overlapped with an outer edge of the floor 9 and extending downward from the said outer edge, the side panel 4 being fixed with plural bolts 27 in the overlapped state.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention ]<br>
In the above prior art it is preferable that the side panel be mounted to the floor 9 without leaving any clearance. Particularly, when the side panel 4 is overlapped with the floor 9 at a side position of the vehicle, a clearance, if any between the respective mating surfaces, is apt to be conspicuous and influences the appearance of the two-wheeled motor vehicle.<br>
Such a clearance between the mating surfaces can be eliminated by making the bolt pitch small, but the mounting work becomes troublesome.<br>
The adoption of a plug-in structure or a labyrinth structure may be effective in hiding the mating surfaces, but it will result in a complicated structure and require a high machining accuracy.<br>
There also is a method wherein the side panel 4 is bonded to the floor 9.  However, a jig for the bonding is<br><br>
required, and it takes time for obtaining a completely bonded state, which leads to deterioration of the working efficiency. Thus, the said method is not advisable.<br>
Further, molding the side panel 4 integrally with the floor 9 may also be one method.  In this case, however, a complicated shape results and it is not easy to fabricate a mold for such integral molding.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a structure which permits the upper edge of a floor skirt to be mounted to an outer edge of a step plate easily without any clearance. <br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, in a scooter type two-wheeled motor vehicle having a step plate mounted to a body frame and a floor skirt extending downward from an outer edge of the step plate, the invention defined in claim 1 is characterized in that the step plate is formed with a vertical wall portion extending a predetermined certain distance downward from the outer edge of the step plate and a leg portion extending a predetermined certain distance from the vertical wall portion at a position inside the vertical wall portion, a<br><br>
receiving pawl portion is formed at a lower part of the leg portion, while the floor skirt is formed with a first lateral portion extending inward from an upper edge of the floor skirt, a rising portion rising from an inner end of the first lateral portion, and a second lateral portion extending inward from an upper part of the rising portion, an inner end of the second lateral portion is abutted against the leg portion and engaged with the receiving pawl portion, the rising portion is abutted against the back of the vertical wall portion, and the first lateral portion is abutted against the lower end of the vertical wall portion.<br>
[0006]<br>
The inner end of the second lateral portion strikes against the leg portion and is engaged with the receiving pawl portion, the rising portion is abutted against the back of the vertical wall portion, and the first lateral portion is abutted against the lower end of the vertical wall portion. Therefore, the upper edge of the floor skirt can be mounted to the outer edge of the step plate easily without any clearance. Besides, in the case where the step plate and the floor skirt are mounted together with clamping members, it is possible to use a reduced number of such clamping members. <br>
[0007]<br><br>
The invention defined in claim 2 is characterized in that a protrusion for preventing a side shift of a mat is formed on the upper surface of the step plate.<br>
[0008]<br>
A side shift of a mat placed on the upper surface of the step plate can be prevented easily by the protrusion.  Further, since the protrusion is formed on the upper surface of the step plate, it is possible to enhance the flexural rigidity of the step plate.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a combined structure of a step plate and a floor skirt in a scooter type two-wheeled motor vehicle having the step plate mounted to a body frame and the floor skirt extending downward from an outer edge of the step plate, characterized in that said step plate is formed with a vertical wall portion extending downward from the outer edge of the step plate and a leg portion extending from said vertical wall portion at a position inside the vertical wall portion, a receiving pawl portion is formed at a lower part of said leg portion, while said floor skirt is formed with a first lateral portion extending inward from an upper edge of the floor skirt, a rising portion rising from an inner end of said first lateral portion, and a second lateral portion extending inward from an upper part of said rising portion, and inner end of said second lateral portion is abutted against said leg portion and engaged with said receiving pawl portion, said rising portion is abutted against the back of said vertical wall portion, and said first lateral portion is abutted against the lower end of said vertical wall portion.<br><br>

each comprise an air inlet 2la, a duct 51 and a plurality of air outlets 22b ... (the dots ...represents plurality, as is also the case in the following).<br>
More specifically, in the body cover 17, the air inlet 2 la for introducing a running wind is formedin the front surface of the front cover 21, the traveling wind introduced from the air inlet 21a is conducted toward a leg shield 22a through the duct 51 and is allowed to jet from the plural air outlets 22b — formed in a side end portion of the leg shield 22a.  The air outlets 22b — are long openings formed vertically in parallel and are provided with a plurality of louvers (flow uniforming plates) 22c .... arranged vertically. <br>
[0015]<br>
Fig.3 is a side view of a central portion of the two-wheeled motor vehicle.<br>
The double cradle type body frame 2 mainly comprises a main pipe 61 extending obliquely downward from the head pipe 3, down tubes 62 extending downward from both main pipe 61 and head pipe 3 and generally U-shaped in side view, and sub-frames extending from the rear,lower portions of the down tubes 62 backward and upward with respect to the main pipe 61.  Step floors 23 are attached to the frame 2 through stays 66 extending longitudinally of the<br><br>
vehicular body. As to the structure for mounting the step floors 23, it will be described later.<br>
[0016]<br>
Fig. 4 is a side view of the fuel tank and the vicinity thereof in the two-wheeled motor vehicle (with the body cover removed), in which the fuel tank 8 and the reserve tank 9 are arranged along the underside of the main pipe 61 extending obliquely downward from the head pipe 3.<br>
The fuel tank 8 is provided sideways with a strainer 72 through a first bracket 71 and is also provided with a fuel pump 74 through a second bracket 73.<br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 5 is a side view of the radiator and the vicinity thereof in the two-wheeled motor vehicle (with the body cover removed).<br>
The radiator 10 is disposed just behind the fuel tank 8 and it is provided with a fan 81 on the back side thereof.  Behind the fan 81 (behind the radiator 10) is disposed a deflector 82 for conducting hot exhaust air from the radiator 10 to the exterior of the vehicle body.  The deflector 82 is a generally inverted L-shaped member in a side view which covers only the portions above and behind the fan 81.<br>
[0018]<br><br>
The undercover 25, which is bolted to the body frame 2, has an air outlet 25a formed below both fan 81 and deflector 82 to discharge the wind (hot exhaust air) which has been changed its direction by the deflector 82.  The air outlet 25a is provided with a large number of louvers (flow uniforming plates) 25b ...facing obliquely backward. The deflector 82 and the louvers 25b ...constitute a flow uniforming mechanism for uniforming the flow of air.<br>
The lower portion of the front side of the front cover 21 is covered with a front lower cover 31, which extends up to the upper portion of the front end of the undercover 25.<br>
[0019]<br>
To the radiator 10 are connected a discharge hose 91 for discharging coolant to the water-cooled engine 11, a return hose 92 for return of the coolant from the engine 11, and a filler hose 94 communicating with a filler cap 93.  The filler cap 93 is connected also to the reserve tank 9 through an overflow hose 95.<br>
Thus, in the space between the radiator 10 and the water-cooled engine 11 are mounted the deflector 82 and the flow path for the flow of hot exhaust air from the radiator 10, as well as the hoses 91,92,94 and 95 alone, so that the hoses 91,92,94 and 95 can be laid rationally and short.<br>
[0020]<br>
The link mechanism 13 comprises a first link 13a attached to the body frame 2, a second link 13b which connects the first link 13a and the front portion of the power unit 12 with each other, a first restricting portion 13c for restricting the amount of swing of the first link 13a, and a second restricting portion 13d for restricting the amount of swing of the second link 13b relative to the first link 13a. <br>
[0021]<br>
Fig.6 is a plan view of a central portion of the two-wheeled motor vehicle (with a portion of the body cover being removed), in which the front cover 21, inner cover 22, step floor 23, center cover 26, fittings attached to the fuel tank 8, and the reserve tank 9, are omitted.<br>
In the body cover 17 are formed cooling air passages 84,84 for causing cooling air (including the running wind generated with running of the vehicle) Fc introduced from the front of the vehicle to advance backward. The radiator 10 is disposed inside the cooling air passages 84,84. Right and left guide plates 85,85 for introducing the cooling air Fc to the radiator 10 are provided in the cooling air passages 84,84.<br>
Further, in the cooling air passages 84,84 are<br><br>
disposed vehicular fixtures such as the fuel tank 8 in front of the radiator 10, the reserve tank 9 shown in Fig. 5 and the fuel pump.  It follows that the flow uniforming mechanism indicated at 83 and shown in Fig. 5 is provided in the cooling air passages 84,84.<br>
The right and left floor skirts 24, 24 are formed with air outlets 24a,24a for discharging to the exterior the air flow which has been changed direction by the deflector 82.<br>
[0022]<br>
The fuel tank 8 and the radiator 10 are disposed centrally in the transverse direction of the vehicle body. The spacing between the right and left down tubes 62,62 is larger than the width of the fuel tank 8 and that of the radiator 10.  Consequently, the fuel tank 8 and the radiator 10 are protected by the down tubes 62,62.<br>
The main pipe 61 branches in a generally Y shape in plan centrally in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body. The branches and the main pipe are connected together with a joint 65. <br>
[0023]<br>
Fig. 7 is a front view of the two- wheeled motor vehicle (with the front forks and the front wheel being removed).<br>
The front cover 21 is provided with the head lamp 41 centrally of its upper front face and a lamp checking lid 36 for inspection of relay, fuse, etc. (not shown).<br>
The air inlet 2 la and the long duct 51 are formed each two right and left in the front cover 21.  The air outlets 22b, .. .formed in the side end portion of the leg shield 22a are also arranged right and left in two rows in right and left leg shields 22a.<br>
[0024]<br>
The lower portion of the front side of the front cover 21 extend downward in a fork shape to open the front lower portion. The space between the said open portion and the floor skirts 24,24 located on both sides below the front cover 21 is covered with the front cover 31.  The front lower cover 31 has an upper opening 31a for passing therethrough of the front forks 4 and also has air inlets 31b,31b for the radiator.  The air inlets 31b,31b, which are formed in right and left lower positions of the front lower cover 31, are each provided with a large number of louvers (flow uniforming plates) 31c ....<br>
[0025]<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken on line 8-8 in Fig. 4, showing that a recess 8a is formed in part of the upper portion of the fuel tank 8 and at least a part of the<br><br>
reserve tank 9 is disposed in the recess 8a.<br>
The fuel tank 8 has an oiling port 8b with a fuel tank cap 75 attached thereto, and the reserve tank 9 has a coolant inlet 9a with an inlet cap 76 attached thereto,  it follows that the inlet cap 76 of the reserve tank 9 is disposed sideways of the fuel tank cap 75.  Since the oiling port 8b and the coolant inlet 9a are located at high positions and are inclined obliquely backward, both oiling work and coolant pouring work can be done in a highly efficient manner.<br>
The center cover 26 has a window 26a formed in the upper portion thereof.  The window 26a is partitioned vertically by a partition plate 26b.  The oiling port 8b nad the coolant inlet 9a are extended from the partition plate 26b into the window 26a, and the window 26a is covered with the oiling lid 43.<br>
[0026]<br>
As will be described later, the fuel tank cap 75 and the coolant inlet cap 76 are covered with a single oiling lid 43.  Upon opening of one oiling lid 43, one can see that the fuel tank cap 75 and the inlet cap 76 are arranged. Thus, if only one oiling lid 43 is opened, it becomes possible to perform both fuel and coolant checking and replenishing works.  Not only the working efficiency is<br><br>
high, but also the number of the oiling lid 43 can be reduced.<br>
Further, since part of the fuel tank 8 having a high morphological freedom is recessed and at least part of the reserve tank 9 is disposed in the recess 8a thus formed, it is possible to reduce the space for arrangement of the fuel tank 8 and the reserve tank 9.  Thus, the space efficiency is high.<br>
As will be described later, the cooling air passages 84,84 are formed along the right and left step floors 23, 23 to pass the cooling air FC therethrough.<br>
[0027]<br>
Fig. 9 is a sectional view taken on line 9-9 in Fig. 5, showing that the step floors 23,23 are located right and left.<br>
The right and left floor skirts 24,24 are extended downward from the outer edges of the step floors 23,23 and the space between the floor skirts 24,24 is covered with the undercover 25 to constitute the cooling air passages 84,84.<br>
Thus, since the step floors 23,23, floor skirts 24,24 and undercover 25 also serve as the cooling air passages 84,84, it is not necessary to separately provide such cooling air passages.  Consequently, it is possible to<br><br>
widen the cooling air passages 84,84 and hence it is possible to let cooling air flow efficiently, thus permitting the cooling efficiency of the radiator 10 to be enhanced.  Besides, since it is not necessary to separately provide the cooling air passages 84,84, the structure of the cooling air passages can be simplified and the number of parts can be reduced.<br>
Further, since the radiator 10 is disposed while utilizing the inside space of the center cover 26 effectively, the height of the radiator 10 can be set large.<br>
Right and left lower portions of the radiator 10 are attached to brackets of the down tubes 62, and the left upper portion thereof is attached to a bracket 65a of the joint 65. As to the right and left guide plates 85,85, the lower portions thereof are clipped to brackets 66d,66d of the stays 66,66 and the upper portions thereof are clipped to brackets 65a,65b of the joint 65.<br>
[0028]<br>
The flow of cooling air in the radiator 10 and the vicinity thereof will be described below with reference to Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 10 is an operation diagram in the radiator and the vicinity thereof used in the present invention..<br><br>
The fan 81 located behind the radiator 10 sucks air from the front of the radiator.  Consequently, the outside air, as the cooling air (including the running wind generated with running of the vehicle) Fc, enters the air inlets 31b,31b for the radiator, then flows through the cooling air passages 84,84 and is conducted into the radiator 10 by the guide plates 85,85.<br>
Hot air (hot exhaust air) Fh which has passed through the radiator 10 is discharged from the fan 81 and is changed its flowing direction into the transverse and downward directions by the deflector 82, then flows out to the exterior through the air outlets 24a,24a,25a formed in the floor skirts 24,24 and undercover 25.  The hot air Fh flowing out from the air outlets 24a,24a,25a flows backward as it is along the body cover 17. <br>
[0029]<br>
Thus, the cooling air FC flowing through the cooling air passages 84,84 is conducted to the radiator 10 by the guide plates 85,85, so that the cooling air Fc can be introduced efficiently into the radiator 10. Consequently, the cooling efficiency of the radiator 10 is enhanced.<br>
Moreover, since the direction of the hot air Fh having passed the radiator 10 is changed by the deflector<br><br>
82, it is possible to prevent the influence of the hot air Fh on the water-cooled engine 11 located behind the radiator 10.<br>
[0030]<br>
Further, since the hot air (wind) Fh having been changed its direction by the deflector 82 is discharged more positively to the exterior through the air outlets 24a,24a,25a formed in at least one of the floor skirts 24,24 and the undercover 25, the pressure loss on the discharge side decreases. As a result, the cooling air Fc can be allowed to flow efficiently to the cooling air passages 84,84, so that the cooling efficiency of the radiator 10 is enhanced.<br>
[0031]<br>
Further, since the flow uniforming mechanism 83 for uniforming the flow of air is provided behind the radiator 10, the pressure loss on the discharge side decreases, thus permitting the cooling air to flow efficiently through the cooling air passages 84,84. Therefore, even if such vehicular fixtures as fuel tank 8, coolant reserve tank 9 and fuel pump 74 are disposed in the cooling air passages 84,84 and in front of the radiator 10, it is possible to let the cooling air Fc to flow efficiently in an amount sufficient to cool the radiator 10.  Consequently, the<br><br>
space of the cooling air passages 84,84 can be utilized effectively.<br>
[0032]<br>
Further, with respect to the radiator 10 located centrally in the vehicular transverse direction, the air inlets 31b,31b for the radiator are offset to both sides, so that a restriction member (say louvers) for preventing the entry of muddy water from the air inlets 31b, 31b into the radiator 10 need not be provided just before the radiator or within the cooling air passages 84,84. <br>
[0033]<br>
Now, the left-hand windshield device 50 will be described with reference to Figs. 11 to 14.  As to the right-hand windshield device 50, it is symmetric with the left-hand windshield device 50, so an explanation thereof is here omitted.<br>
Fig. 11 is a sectional view taken on line 11-11 in Fig. 7, showing the left-hand air inlet 2 la and leg shield 22a, as well as the vicinity thereof.<br>
The leg shields 22a extend in the transverse direction of the vehicle from both sides of the inner cover 22, and the air outlets 22b formed in side end portions of the leg shields 22a face obliquely backward in the transverse direction of the vehicle.<br><br>
The air inlets 2 la are each a generally conical through hole whose diameter is reduced toward the back. Each duct 51 communicating with the said through hole is a generally L-shaped duct having an outlet 51b which faces toward the air outlet 22b of the associated leg shield 22a. Since the duct 51 is L-shaped, one cannot see the components located behind the front cover 21 from the front side. Consequently, the appearance of the scooter 1 is improved .<br>
The outlet 51b of the duct 51 is spaced a predetermined distance from the air outlet 22b of the leg shield 22a.<br>
[0034]<br>
Fig. 12 is a sectional view taken on line 12-12 in Fig. 7, showing that the lower portion of the left-hand duct 51 is bolted at one position through a stay 52 in the interior of the front cover 21. <br>
[0035]<br>
Fig. 13 is a sectional view taken on line 13-13 in Fig. 7, showing that the upper portion of the left-hand duct 51 is bolted at two positions in the interior of the front cover 21 and around the air inlet 2 la.<br>
Thus, as is apparent from Figs. 11 to 13, the ducts 51 are attached to the front cover 21 and an outlet 51b of<br><br>
each duct 51 is spaced a predetermined distance from the air outlet 22b of the associated leg shield 22a. Therefore, all that is required is merely bolting the duct 51 to only the front cover 21 at three positions.  Thus, the structure for mounting the duct 51 is simple and the duct mounting work is easy.<br>
[0036]<br>
Figs. 14 (a) to (e) are construction diagrams of the left-hand duct, of which (a) is a side view, (b) is a right side view, (c) is a plan view, (d) is a sectional view taken on line d-d in (a), and (e) is a sectional view taken on line e-e in (a) .<br>
The left duct 51 has an inlet 51a of a size corresponding to the size of the air inlet 21a, while the outlet 51b thereof conforms to the shape of the leg shield 22a and has a size which covers plural air outlets 22b ....Running wind introduced from the inlet 51a is distributed substantially uniformly to all of the air outlets 22b ...shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The duct 51 has a vertically through drain hole 51c formed in its lower portion.  While the vehicle is running in a rainy weather, rain water which has entered the interior through the air inlet 21a of the front cover 21 goes out through the drain hole 51c formed in the lower<br><br>
portion of the duct 51. Thus, there is no fear of water staying in the bottom of the front cover or in the bottom of the duct.<br>
[0037]<br>
The operation of the right and left windshield devices 50,50 constructed as above will be described below with reference to Fig. 15, which is an operation diagram of the windshield devices.<br>
While the scooter 1 is running, running winds (front flows) Fw flowing toward the front side of the front cover 21 partially enter the air inlets 2 la, pass through the ducts 51 and are jetted obliquely backward from the air outlets 22b formed in side end portions of the leg shields 22a.  Running winds (rear flows) Uw thus jetted join the front flows Fw which have passed the side end portions of the leg shields 22a, so that a negative pressure generated on the back side of each leg shield 22a is small. As a result, the force of rolling in the front flow toward the back of each leg shield 22a becomes weak, so that the front flow Fw does not lap around the peripheral edge of the leg shield 22a but flows backward as it is.  Thus, the wind shielding effect for the legs Ma of the driver M is enhanced.  Since the wind shielding effect is high, it is not necessary to provide any protector against wind<br><br>
projecting from the scooter 1. Now that there is no projection of a wind protector, the appearance, shape and size of the scoorter 1 remain the same.  Thus, it is possible to prevent an increase in size of the scooter 1, improve the appearance of the scooter and enhance the wind shielding effect for the legs Ma of the driver M.<br>
Further, since the front flows Fw flow backward as they are without lapping around the peripheral edges of the leg shields 22a, the wind shielding effect for a fellow passenger is enhanced.  Consequently, the driver and the fellow passenger can feel comfortableness.<br>
[0038]<br>
The following description is now provided about the structure for mounting the left step floor 23 and floor skirt 24 with reference to Figs. 16 to 21.  As to the right step floor 23 and floor skirt 24, they are symmetric and identical in construction with the left ones, so explanations thereof are here omitted.<br>
[0039]<br>
Fig. 16 is an exploded perspective view of the structure for mounting the left step floor and floor skirt.<br>
The body frame 2 is provided with brackets 62a and 62b at front and rear positions, respectively, of the down tube 62, and bosses 63a,63a are formed on the<br>
-30-<br><br>
sub-frame 63.  The stay 66 is provided with three brackets (front bracket 66a, middle bracket 66b and rear bracket 66c) arranged in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body. The stay 66 is mounted to the body frame 2 by bolting the three brackets 66a,66b and 66c to the brackets 62a,62b and the bosses 63a, 63a of the body frame. The front and middle brackets 66a, 66b are generally inverted L-shaped in a front view, and the left step floor 23 is bolted to the upper surface of those brackets.<br>
[0040]<br>
Fig. 17 is a sectional view showing a mounting structure for the left step floor, in which the front bracket 66a is bolted to the bracket 62a of the down tube 62 and a step portion 23a is bolted to the upper surface of the front bracket 66a.<br>
The left step floor 23 as a step plate is generally L-shaped in section, with a cover portion 23b extending upward from an inner edge (leftmost end in the figure). A mat 67 made of a flexible material is placed on the upper surface of the step floor 23. The step floor 23 has a stepped portion 23c formed in the upper surface thereof in proximity to the inner edge of the step portion 23 and also has a protrusion (a belt-like wall portion formed along an<br><br>
outer edge of the step portion) 23d extending upward from the upper surface of the outer edge, to prevent a side shift of the mat 67 in cooperation with a leg portion with pawl 67a which will be described later (in connection with Fig. 20).<br>
[0041]<br>
A side shift of the mat 67 placed on the upper surface of the step floor 23 can be prevented easily by both stepped portion 23c and protrusion 23d.  Besides, the presence of the protrusion 23d on the step floor 23 can enhance the flexural rigidity of the step floor.<br>
A bolt insertion hole 23e is formed in the shape of a recess so that the head of a step portion fixing bolt 68 is positioned lower than the upper surface of the step portion 23a. Thus, the head of the bolt 68 is closed by the mat 67 and is not visible, affording a good appearance.<br>
[0042]<br>
Figs. 18 (a) and (b) are sectional views showing a combined structure of the left step floor (step plate) and the associated floor skirt, of which (a) is a sectional view as seen from the front and (b) is an exploded perspective view of a principal portion.<br>
The left step floor 23 has a vertical wall portion 23f extending downward a predetermined distance from an<br><br>
outer edge (rightmost end in the figure) and a leg portion 23g extending downward a predetermined distance at a position inside the vertical wall portion 23f, with a receiving pawl portion 23h being formed at a lower position of the leg portion 23g.<br>
[0043]<br>
On the other hand, the floor skirt 24 has a first lateral portion 24b extending inward from the upper edge, a rising portion 24c rising from an inner end of the first lateral portion 24b, and a second lateral portion 24d extending inward from the upper part of the rising portion 4c.<br>
For mounting the floor skirt 24 to the step floor 23, an inner end of the second lateral portion 24d is abutted against the leg portion 23g and is engaged with the receiving pawl portion 23h, likewise the rising portion 24c is abutted against the back of the vertical wall portion 23f, and the first lateral portion 24b is abutted against the lower end of the vertical wall portion 23f.<br>
Thus, the outer edge of the step floor 23 is formed in a generally square U- shape in section by the step portion 23a of the step floor 23, the vertical wall portion 23f and the second lateral portion 24d of he floor skirt 24 to enhance the rigidity thereof.<br>
[0044]<br>
Fig. 19 is a sectional view showing a fixing structure of the left-hand step floor (step plate) and the associated floor skirt, in which the second lateral portion 24d of the floor skirt 24 is fixed to the step portion 23a of the step floor 23 with both screw 69a and a nut 69b with clip.<br>
The clip of the nut with clip 69b is inserted resiliently into an inner end of the second lateral portion 24d. A screw inserting hole 23 j is formed in the shape of a recess so that the head of the screw 69a is positioned lower than the upper surface of the step portion 23a. Therefore, the head of the screw 69a is closed by the mat 67 and is not visible, affording a good appearance. The screw 69a may be substituted by a bolt.<br>
[0045]<br>
Fig. 20 as a sectional view showing a structure for mounting the left-hand mat.  The step floor 23 has a mat mounting hole 23k formed in its step portion 23a. On the other hand, the mat 67 has the leg portion with pawl 67a extending downward from the back thereof.  For mounting the mat 67 to the step floor 23, the leg portion 67a is inserted into the mat mounting hole 23k, allowing its pawl to be engaged with the step portion 23a.<br>
[0046]<br>
Fig. 21 is a plan view of the left-hand step floor (step plate), showing a state in which the stepped portion 23c and the protrusion 23d are formed on the inner and outer edges, respectively, of the step portion 23a of the step floor 23.  Fig. 21 also shows a relation of arrangement among two bolt inserting holes 23e,23e, four sets of leg portions 23g, . . . , receiving pawl portions 23h ..., holes for molding 23i ..., three screw inserting holes 23 j ...., and eleven mat mounting holes 23k . . . , which are formed in the step portion 23a.<br>
Thus, since the combined structure shown in Fig. 18 is applied to the connection between the outer edge of the step floor 23 and the upper edge of the floor skirt 24, both can be combined together in a simple manner without leaving any clearance.  Besides, as shown in Fig. 19, although the step floor 23 and the floor skirt 24 are connected together with screws (using clamping means), the number of screws 69a ... used is small.<br>
[0048]<br>
[0047]<br>
Now, the structure of the fuel tank 8 and that of the reserve tank 9, as well as their mounting structure, will be described below with reference to Figs. 22 to 26.<br><br>
Figs.22(a) to (c) are construction diagrams of the fuel tank, of which (a) is a side view, (b) is a left side view, and (c) is a plan view.<br>
The fuel tank 8 comprises two right and left tank halves (a left tank half 8A and a right tank half 8B) which are superimposed together and whose flanges 8c are combined together by welding for example.  As shown in (a), an upper surface 8d is inclined, and an oiling port 8b is formed nearly perpendicularly to the said inclined surface. Further, as shown in (b), the recess 8a is formed partially, and a discharge pipe 8e is provided.  To the right tank half 8B are mounted a tank mounting bolt 8f , a first bracket 71 and a second bracket 73, and in the flanges 8c are formed first, second and third tank mounting holes 8g, 8h,8i. The second bracket 73 has a support hole 73a, as shown in (c).<br>
[0049]<br>
Figs. 23 (a) to (c) are construction diagrams of the reserve tank, of which (a) is a side view, (b) is a plan view and (c) is a left side view.<br>
The reserve tank 9 which reserves coolant for the radiator is a generally V-shaped tank comprising a horizontal left half and a right half extending downward to the right, as shown in (a).  The upper surface of the right<br><br>
half is formed as an inclined surface 9b which is inclined at about the same angle of inclination as the upper surface (inclined surface) 8d of the fuel tank 8, and a coolant inlet 9a is formed nearly perpendicularly to the inclined surface 9b.  The reserve tank 9 is translucent so that the coolant reserved therein can be seen. As shown in (a) and (b), two lines of scale projections (an upper-limit scale 9c and a lower-limit scale 9d) for checking the level of coolant are formed on the inclined surface 9b.<br>
In the figure, the numeral 9e denotes a discharge port, 9f denotes an overflow port, 9g a mounting bracket, and 9h a positioning pin.<br>
[0050]<br>
Fig. 24 is an exploded perspective view of the mounting structure for the fuel tank and the reserve tank.<br>
The body frame 2 has two bolts 6 la, 6 la at a side portion of the main pipe 61, two upper and lower bosses 62c,62c at side positions of the front portion of the left down tube 62, and a bracket 64a on a cross pipe 64 which connects the right and left down tubes 62,62 with each other.<br>
[0051]<br>
For mounting the fuel tank 8 to the body frame 2, the flange 8c of the fuel tank 8 is fixed to the main pipe<br><br>
61 with two bolts 61a,61a, then the fuel tank is bolted to the two bosses 62c,62c of the left down tube 62 through a hanger 66, and the flange of the fuel tank is bolted to the bracket 64a on the cross pipe.<br>
For mounting the reserve tank 9, the flange 8c and the hanger 66 are co-clamped to the main pipe 61 with the front bolts 6 la, then the mounting bracket 9g of the reserve tank 9 is bolted to the hanger 66, and the positioning pin 9h of the reserve tank 9 is inserted for positioning into the support hole 73a formed in the second bracket 73 of the fuel tank 8.  Since the positioning pin 9h is inserted into the support hole 73a of the second bracket 73, the reserve tank 9 mounting structure is simple and the mounting work is easy.<br>
[0052]<br>
Fig. 25 is a perspective of the center cover, with the window 26a being formed in an upper position of the front portion of the cover.<br>
[0053]<br>
Figs. 26 (a) and (b) are construction diagrams of the center cover, of which (a) is a side view of the front portion and (b) is a plan view of the front portion, with the oiling lid 43 being opened.<br>
As shown in (a), the oiling lid 43 for covering the<br><br>
window 26a is attached to the center cover 26 through a hinge 43a.  The window 26a is provided with a lock 43b.<br>
When the oiling lid 43 is opened for the feed of oil as in (b), it is seen that the fuel tank cap 75 and the inlet cap 76 are arranged, and one can see the coolant level and scales.  At the time of oiling, therefore, it is also possible to check the residual amount of coolant and replenish the coolant where required.  Thus, it is easy to check the residual amount of coolant and perform the coolant replenishing work.  In other words, the number of the oiling lid 43 can be reduced.<br>
[0054]<br>
The partition plate 26b fitted in the window 26a has a level detecting window 26c for detecting the level by reference to the two lines of scales (upper-limit scale 9c and lower-limit scale 9d) of the reserve tank 9. Marks 26d,26d such as letters, pictures or symbols corresponding to the scales 9c and 9d are affixed to the partition plate 26b in proximity to the level detecting window 26c.  For example, the marks "UPPER" and "LOWER" are used in correspondence to the upper- and lower-limit scales 9c,9d, respectively. Therefore, the level of the coolant which can be seen through the translucent reserve tank 9 can be checked easily by reference to the scales 9c,9d and the<br><br>
marks 26d,26d.  Thus, the coolant level detection is easy. [0055]<br>
The ducts 51 of the right and left windshield devices 50 used in the above embodiment are not limited to an L shape in section at the inlet 5la level as in Fig. 10. For example, each duct 51 may be a straight pipe extending in the longitudinal direction.<br>
The guide plates 85 for conducting the cooling air Fc to the radiator 10 are not limited to the shape of a flat plate.  They may be in any other shape.<br>
Also as to the deflector 82, its shape is not specially limited if only it can conduct the hot exhaust air Fh from the radiator 10 to the exterior of the vehicle body.<br>
The air outlet for discharging the air flow to the exterior after being changed its direction by the deflector 82 may be at least one of the air outlets 24a formed in the floor skirt 24 and the air outlet 25a formed in the undercover 25.<br>
The step floors 23 and the floor skirts 24 may be connected together by using only the connecting structure shown in Fig. 18.  It is optional whether a screw (screw 69a and nut 69b) is to be used or not.<br>
[0056]<br><br>
[Effects of the Invention}<br>
The above construction of the present invention brings about the following effects.<br>
In a scooter type two-wheeled motor vehicle having a step plate mounted to a body frame and a floor skirt extending downward from an outer edge of the step plate, the invention defined in claim 1 is characterized in that the step plate is formed with a vertical wall portion extending a predetermined certain distance downward from the outer edge of the step plate and a leg portion extending a predetermined certain distance from the vertical wall portion at a position inside the vertical wall portion, a receiving pawl portion is formed at a lower part of the leg portion, while the floor skirt is formed with a first lateral portion extending inward from an upper portion of the floor skirt, a rising portion rising from an inner end of the first lateral portion, and a second lateral portion extending inward from an upper part of the rising portion, an inner end of the second lateral portion is abutted against the leg portion and engaged with the receiving pawl portion, the rising portion is abutted against the back of the vertical wall portion, and the first lateral portion is abutted against the lower end of the vertical wall portion.<br>
[0057]<br>
The inner end of the second lateral portion strikes against the leg portion and is engaged with the receiving pawl portion, the rising portion is abutted against the back of the vertical wall portion, and the first lateral portion is abutted against the lower end of the vertical wall portion. Therefore, the upper edge of the floor skirt can be mounted to the outer edge of the step plate easily without any clearance.  Besides, in the case where the step plate and the floor skirt are mounted together with clamping members, it is possible to use a reduced number of such clamping members.<br>
The invention defined in claim 2 is characterized in that a protrusion for preventing a side shift of a mat is formed on the upper surface of the step plate.<br>
[0059]<br>
[0058]<br>
A side shift of a mat placed on the upper surface of the step plate can be prevented easily by the protrusion. Further, since the protrusion is formed on the upper surface of the step plate, it is possible to enhance the flexural rigidity of the step plate.<br><br>
