Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for producing an amic acid ester from an amino acid. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for producing an amic acid ester useful as an intermediate for agrochemical, from an amino acid (a raw material) easily at a low cost industrially.<br>
Background Art<br>
A mixed acid carboxyanhydride process has been known for reaction of the acid moiety of an amic acid obtained from an amino acid (a raw material) , with other amine (Nobuo Izumiya et al. , "Synthesis Chemistry Series -Peptide Synthesis", pp. 12 6 to 12 9, Oct. 30, 1970, Maruzen<br>
K.K.) .<br>
In this process,  first, the amino group of an<br><br>
amino acid is reacted with a chlorocarbonic acid ester to synthesize an amide; then, the carboxylic acid moiety of the imide is reacted with a chlorocarbonic acid ester to form a nixed acid carboxyanhydride; and the mixed acid ^arboxyanhydride is reacted with a corresponding amine to synthesize an intended product.<br>
In the process, however, since the formation of<br>
e<br>
the acid carboxyanhydride is slow in the presence of water, the second reaction must be conducted in a non-aqueous system using a water-free solvent; therefore, the amide synthesized in an aqueous solvent in the first reaction need be dehydrated; moreover, the second reaction need be conducted in a non-aqueous system as mentioned above; accordingly, the process has a problem in that it is complicated for industrial operation.<br>
Moreover, the dehydration step required for the synthesized amide reduces the productivity per unit time, etc. and needs a longer time for heating of the reaction system, resulting in decomposition of intended product,  etc.  and consequent  reduction  in  yield;   therefore,   the  above<br><br>
conventional process has a problem in cost as well.<br>
The present invention aims at providing a process for producing an amic acid ester useful as an intermediate for agrochemical, from an amino acid (a raw material) easily at a low cost industrially.<br>

unsubstituted aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic alkyl group; and R3 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group), which process comprises reacting, in the presence of water, an amino acid represented by the following general formula (1):<br><br>
(wherein A has the same definition as given above) with a halogenated carbonic acid ester represented by the following general formula (2) :<br><br>
(wherein R^ has the same definition as given above and X is a halogen atom) to form an amide compound represented by the following general formula (3):<br><br><br>
(wherein A and R1 have the same definitions as given above), then reacting the amide compound with a halogenated carbonic acid ester represented by the following general formula (4):<br><br>
(wherein R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic alkyl group; and X is a halogen atom) to form, in the system, a mixed acid carboxyanhydride represented by the following general formula (5):<br><br><br>
(wherein A, R1 and R2 have the same definitions as given above), and reacting the mixed acid carboxyanhydride with an amine compound represented by the following general formula<br>
(6) or salt thereof:<br><br>
(wherein R3 has the same definition as given above and Het is<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group),<br>
[2 ]        A process for producing an amic acid ester, set<br>
forth in  [1] ,  wherein the amino acid represented by the<br>
general formula (1) is dissolved in water and reacted with<br>
the  halogenated  carbonic  acid  ester  represented by  the<br>
general formula (2).<br>
[3]	A process for producing an amic acid ester, set<br>
forth in  [1], wherein the reaction of the amide compound<br>
represented by the general formula (3) with the halogenated<br><br>
carbonic acid ester represented by the general formula (4) is conducted in a reaction system comprising water or a water-organic solvent mixture.<br>
[4 ] A process for producing an amic acid ester, set forth in [1]/ wherein the reaction of the mixed acid carboxyanhydride represented by the general formula (5) with the amine compound represented by the general formula (6) or its salt is conducted in a reaction system comprising water or a water-organic solvent mixture.<br>
[5]	A process for producing an amic acid ester, set<br>
forth in [1], wherein the all the steps are conducted in one pot (one reactor).<br>
[6] A process for producing an amic acid ester, set forth in [1], wherein the amino acid represented by the general formula (1) is valine and the chlorocarbonic acid ester represented by the general formula (2) is isopropyl chlorocarbonate.<br>
[7 ] A process for producing an amic acid ester, set forth in [6], wherein the all the steps are conducted in one pot (one reactor).<br><br>
[ 8 ] A process for producing an amic acid ester, set<br>
forth in [ 1 ] , wherein the amino acid represented by the<br>
general formula (1) is an optically active valine and the<br>
amine represented by the general formula (6) is an optically<br>
active 1- ( 6-fluorobenzothiazol--2-yl) ethyl amine .<br>
[9]	A process for producing an amic acid ester, set<br>
forth in [8], wherein the all the steps are conducted in one pot (one reactor) .<br>
The present inventors made a study in order to achieve the above aim. As a result, the present inventors surprisingly found out that an amic acid ester can be produced in one pot (one reactor) in the presence of water by adding, to an amino acid (prepared in the form of an aqueous solution of its alkali salt), a chlorocarbonic acid ester to form an amide compound, as necessary neutralizing the alkali present in excess with an acid, adding thereto an organic solvent (e.g. toluene) and a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine to convert the reaction system into a two-phase system, reacting further the amide compound with a chlorocarbonic acid ester in the presence of water to form a mixed acid<br><br>
anhydride in the reaction system in the presence of water, and reacting the mixed acid anhydride with an amine compound corresponding to the intended product (when the amine compound is in the form of a salt such as hydrochloride, sulfonate or the like, an alkali is also added); and moreover that when the raw materials used [for example, the amino acid represented by the above general formula (1) and the amine<br>
e<br>
compound represented by the above general formula (6)] are optically active compounds, there can be synthesized an optically active amic acid ester in which the optical purities of the raw materials used are kept substantially. The above findings have led to the completion of the present invention.<br>

In this reaction, the amide compound represented by the general formula (3) is reacted with a halogenated carbonic acid ester represented by the general formula (4) in water or a water-organic solvent mixture, to produce a mixed acid anhydride represented by the general formula (5).<br>
In the reaction, as the amide compound represented by the general formula (3) , used as a raw material, the reaction mixture obtained in the previous reaction between the amino acid represented by the general formula (1) and the halogenated carbonic acid ester represented by the general formula (2) can be used per se in the same reactor and the reaction product obtained in the previous reaction need not be isolated.<br>
The halogenated carbonic acid ester represented by the general formula (4) , used in the reaction can be any compound represented by the general formula (4). As specific examples of the halogenated carbonic acid ester represented<br><br>

In ■carrying out the reaction, the aqueous solution of the alkali metal salt of the amide compound represented by the general formula (3) is as necessary neutralized with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric<br><br>
acid or the like; thereto may be added an organic solvent miscible or immiscible with water, such as aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene or chlorobenzene), ester (e.g. methyl acetate or ethyl acetate), ether (e.g. diethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether or dioxane) , aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g. pentane, n-hexane or cyclohexane) , ketone (e.g. methyl isobutyl ketone), nitrile (e.g. acetonitrile) , aprotic polar solvent (e.g. sulfolane, dimethylimidazolidinone, dimethylformamide or dimethylacet-amide) .

The use amount of the tertiary amine is 0.001 to 5 moles, preferably 0.05 to 2 moles per mole of the amino acid represented by the general formula (1).<br>
Then, description is made on the production of an amic acid ester represented by the general formula (7) by reaction of the thus-produced mixed acid anhydride represented by the general formula (5) with an amine compound represented by the general formula (6).<br><br>
In the reaction, the mixed acid anhydride represented by the general formula (5) is reacted with an amine compound represented by the general formula (6) in a system comprising water or a water-organic solvent mixture, whereby is produced an amic acid ester represented by the general formula (7), intended by the present invention process.<br>
In the reaction, as the mixed acid anhydride represented by the general formula (5), used as a raw material, the reaction mixture obtained in the previous reaction between the amide compound represented by the general formula (3) and the halogenated carbonic acid ester represented by the general formula (4) can be used per se in the same reactor and the reaction product obtained in the previous reaction need not be isolated.<br>
In the previous reaction, when an organic solvent immiscible with water is used, the aqueous layer may be removed by phase separation, in order to, for example, enable use of a reactor having a capacity as small as possible per mole of the raw material; in that case, the reaction between<br><br>
the compound (5) and the compound (6) proceeds in the organic solvent.<br>
The amine compound represented by the general<br>
formula (6) , used in the reaction can be any compound<br>
represented by the general formula (6) . When the amine<br>
compound (6) has one or more asymmetric carbon atoms, the<br>
compound may be a single optical isomer, or a mixture of any<br>
proportions of individual optical isomers (e.g. a racemic<br>
modification), or a mixture of diastereomers. An acid<br>
addition salt thereof may also be used. As specific examples<br>
of the amine compound represented by the general formula (6)<br>
or its acid addition salt, there can be mentioned (R)-1-(6)-<br>
fluorobenzothiazol-2-yl)ethylamine, (S)-1- ( 6)-fluorobenzo-<br>
thiazol-2-yl) ethylamine, (thiophen-2-yl)methylamine, (R,S)-1-<br>

inorganic acid salts of the above amine compounds represented by the general formula (6) , such as hydrochloride, sulfate, sodium    hydrogensulfate    salt,    phosphate,     sodium dihydrogenphosphate salt, carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate salt and the like; and organic acid salts of the above amine compounds represented by the general formula  (6),  such as acetate, citrate, methanesulfonate, trifluoromethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate,    p-toluenesulfonate,    p-chlorobenzene-sulfonate and the like.  The use amount of such a compound is 0.5 to 10 moles, preferably 0.5 to 2 moles per mole of the amino acid represented by the general formula (1).<br>
Incidentally, for example, the above (R)-1-(6-fluorobenzothiazol-2-yl)ethylamine can be produced by adding a corresponding 2-aminothiophenol derivative alkali metal salt into an acid to reduce the pH of the salt to 6 or less and then reacting the resulting 2-aminothiophenol derivative with a corresponding amino acid-N-carboxyanhydride (see Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-100466).<br>
When,  in  the  reaction,  the  amine  compound<br><br>
represented by the general formula (6) is used in the form of its acid addition salt, the acid addition salt is converted into a free amine compound represented by the general formula (6) by adding an alkali into the reaction system. As the alkali used therefor, there can be mentioned, for example, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The alkali may be added into the reaction system as an aqueous solution containing 1 to 100%, preferably 10 to 50% of the alkali. The use amount of the alkali is 1 mole or more, preferably 1 mole per mole of the acid addition salt of the amine compound represented by the general formula (6).<br>
The reaction can be conducted by adding an amine compound represented by the general formula (6) to a system containing the mixed acid anhydride represented by the general formula (5), in a system comprising water or a water-organic solvent mixture, or in a system comprising an organic solvent when, in the previous reaction, an organic solvent immiscible with water is used and, after the previous reaction, the aqueous layer is removed by phase separation, and then stirring the resulting mixture.  The temperature of<br><br>
:he reaction is -20 to 100°C, preferably 0 to 50°C, and the period of the reaction is 10 hours or less, preferably 0.5 to 5 hours.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the -ntended product of present process, i.e. the amic acid ester represented by the general formula (7) is in dissolution in :he organic phase of the reaction mixture; therefore, the reaction mixture is subjected to phase separation by an )rdinary method, the separated organic phase is, as necessary, /ashed with water and dried, then the organic solvent in the )rganic phase is distilled off to isolate the intended )roduct. Alternatively, the reaction mixture is not ;ubjected to phase separation and is subjected to listillation to remove the organic solvent contained in the ■eaction mixture and obtain an aqueous suspension of the ,ntended product, and the suspension is filtered to isolate he intended product.<br>
