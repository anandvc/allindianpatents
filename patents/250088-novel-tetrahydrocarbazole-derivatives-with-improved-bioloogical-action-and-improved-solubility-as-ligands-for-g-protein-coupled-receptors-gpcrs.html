1<br><br>
NOVEL TETRAHYDROCARBAZOLE DERIVATIVES HAVING IMPROVED BIOLOGICAL ACTION AND IMPROVED SOLUBILITY AS LIGANDS QF G-PROTElN COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCRs)<br>
The present invention relates to novel tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives having improved<br>
biological action, improved oral bioavailability and improved metabolic stability as<br>
ligands of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), in particular as ligands of the receptor<br>
for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH receptor), to the preparation thereof,<br>
and to the use thereof in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of pathological<br>
conditions mediated by G-protein coupled receptors in a mammal and in particular in a<br>
human.	<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The contents of all the publications cited in this application, or comparable sources which are quoted, in order to explain the background of the invention are incorporated in the present application for the purpose of the disclosure.<br>
G-protein coupled receptors represent a superfamily of cell membrane-associated , receptors which play an important part in numerous biochemical and pathobiochemical processes in mammals and especially in humans. All GPCRs Consist of seven hydrophobic, transmembrane alpha-helicaPdomains which are connected together by three intracellular and three extracellular loops and* have an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxy terminus: One onmore heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in their cellular signal transduction. Diverse physiological stimuli such as photosensitivity, taste and odor, but also fundamental processes such as metabolism, reproduction and development are mediated and controlled by them. GPCRs exist for exogenous and endogenous ligands. Peptide hormones, biogenic amines, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, Ca2+, but also photons, have inter alia been identified as ligands; moreover one ligand may activate different receptors.<br>
According to a recent investigation, 367 sequences have been identified in the human genome for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with endogenous ligands, D. K. Vassilatis et al., PNAS 100(8), 4903-4908 '(2Q03). Of these, 284 belong to class A, 50 to class   B, 17 to class C and 11 to class F/S. 'Examples belonging to<br>
2<br><br>
class A are the bombesin, the dopamine and the LHRH receptors, arid to class B are the VIP and the calcitonin receptors. The natural ligands for numerous GPCRs are as yet unknown.<br>
Owing to their function, GPCRs are suitable as targets for medicaments for the therapy and prevention of a large number of pathological conditions. It is speculated that about 50% of currently known targets for active ingredients are GPCRs [Y. Fang et al., DDT 8(16), 755-761 (2003)]. Thus, GPCRs play an important part in pathological processes such as, for example, pain (opioid receptor), asthma ((ß2-adrenoceptor), migraine (serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor), cancer (LHRH receptor), cardiovascular disorders (angiotensin receptor), metabolic disorders (GHS receptor) or depression (serotonin 5-HT1a receptor), K. DPierce et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell S/o/,;3, 639-650 (2002).<br>
General information about GPCRs is to be found under http://www.gpcr,org.<br>
The present invention describes novel ligands with improved properties for GPCRs in general, the compounds provided by the invention acting in particular as antagonists of the LHRH receptor.<br>
The natural ligand of this receptor, the peptide hormone LHRH, is synthesized in cells of the hypothalamus and; released in pulsatile fashion from the hypothalamic neurons into the capillary plexus of the ementia mediana. In the anterior lobe of the pituitary,'LHRH &gt; binds to the LHRH receptors of the gonadotropic cells1 and stimulates certain trimeric G-proteins, which initiate a branched signal transduction cascade. The initial event is activation of phospholipase C, A2'and/or D. This leads to an increased provision of the second messengers diacylgiycerbl and IP3, followed by Ca mobilization from intracellular pools, and activation of various subordinate protein kinases. Finally, there is stimulation of the production and temporally defined pulsatile release of the gonadotropins FSH and LH. The two hormones are transported via the circulation to the target organs the testes and ovaries respectively. There they stimulate the production and release of the appropriate sex hormones. In the opposite direction there is a complex feedback mechanism by which the concentration of the sex hormones formed in turn regulates the release of LH arid FSH<br>
In the male organism, LH binds to membrane receptors of the Leydig cells and stimulates testosterone biosynthesis. FSH acts via specific receptors on the Sertoli cells and assists the production of spermatozoa. In the female organism, LH binds to the LH receptors of<br>
3<br><br>
the theca cells and activates the formation of androgen-synthesizing enzymes. FSH stimulates proliferation of granulosa cells of certain follicle stages via the.FSH receptors thereof. The androgens which are formed are converted in the adjacent granulosa cells to the estrogens estrone and estradiol.<br>
A number of disorders distinguished by benign or malignant tissue proliferations depend on stimulation by sex hormones such as testosterone or Estradiol. Typical disorders of this type are prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in men, and endometriosis, uterine fibroids or uterine myomas, pubertas praecox, hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome, and breast cancer, uterine cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer and ovarian cancer in women.<br>
Since its discovery in 1971 by Schally et al. Science 173, 1036-1038 (1971), more than 3000 synthetic analogues of natural LHRH have been synthesized and tested. Peptide agonists such as triptorelin and leuprolide have been established for many years successfully in the therapy of gynecological disorders and cancers. However, the disadvantage of agonists is generally that they stimulate LHRH receptors in the initial phase of use and thus lead to side effects via an initial increase in the sex hormone levels. Only after downregulation of the LHRH receptor as a result of this overstimulation can the superagonists display their effect. This leads to a complete reduction inthe sex hormone levels and thus to pharmacological castration with all ;the signs and symptoms. This disadvantage is associated with the impossibility of targeted adjustment of the level of sex hormones via the' dosage. Thus, therapy of diseases which do not require a total reduction of the sex hormone levels to the castration level, such as, for example, benign tissue proliferations, with an agonist is not optimal for the patient.<br>
This has led to the development of peptide LHRH receptor antagonists, of which, for example, cetrorelix (Cetrotide®) has been successfully introduced for controlled ovarian stimulation in the context of the treatment of female infertility. The antagonists inhibit the LHRH receptor immediately and dose-dependently, and thus lead to an immediate reduction in the plasma levels of testosterone or estradiol and progesterone. The peptide antagonists are, however, somewhat less potent than the agonists, and thus higher doses must be given.<br>
A review of the clinical applications and the potential of LHRH agonists and antagonists is given by R. P. Millar et al. in British Med. Bull. 56, 761-772 (2000) and R. E. Felberbaum et al., Mol. Cell. Endocrinology 166, 9-14 (2000) and F. Haviv et al; in Integration of<br>
4<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Discovery arid Development: Case Studies, Chapter 7, ed. Borchardt etal., Plenum Press, New York (1998). Besides the treatment of malignant and benign neoplastic diseases, further possible applications are controlled ovarian stimulation in the context of in vitro fertilization, fertility control (contraception), and; protection from : unwanted side effects of radio- or chemotherapy, the treatment of HIV infections (AIDS) and of neurological or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Specific LHRH receptors have not only been found on pituitary cells, but also on cells in various tumors, e.g. of the breast and ovaries. These receptors might mediate a direct antiproliferative effect of LHRH receptor antagonists on the tumor.<br>
The peptide LHRH receptor agonists and antagonists are mostly decapeptides whose* bioavailability is inadequate for oral administration. They are typically given as solutions for injection or as depot formulation, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. This application is associated with inconveniences for the patient, and the compliance suffers. In addition, synthesis of the decapeptides is complicated and costly.<br>
It is therefore sensible to look for non-peptide LHRH receptor antagonists which, besides high activity, have an improved metabolic stability and can be administered orally.<br>
Prior art<br>
Compared with peptide LHRH receptor*agonists and antagonists, as yet no non-peptide compound is approved and in clinical use for any of the possible indications. The current state of development in the area of LHRH receptor agonists and antagonists is described in the reviews by Y.-F. Zhu et al., Expert Opin. Therap. Patents 14(2), 187-199 (2004), Y.-F. Zhu et al., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. (39), 99-110 (2004), F.C. Tucci et al., Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery &amp; Development 7(6), 832-847 (2004), RE. Armer, Curr. Med. Chem. 11, 3017-3028 (2004) and M. V. Chengalvala et al., Curr. Med. Chem-Anti-Cancer Agents, 3, 399-410 (2003). The former publication contains a comprehensive list of the published. patent specifications describing the synthesis and use of low molecular weight LHRH receptor antagonists.<br>
Among the first examples of non-peptide LHRH receptor antagonists is the 4-oxothieno[2,3-b]pyridine structure, which was described by N. Choet al. in J. Med. Chem. 41, 4190-4195 (1998). Although these compounds, such as, for example, T-98475, have a high receptor affinity, their solubility in water is very poor and their<br>
5<br><br>
bioavailability is low. Based on this lead structure, numerous further developments have been carried out, examples which may be mentioned being the publications of the international applications WO 95/28405, WO 96/24597, WO 97/14697 and WO 97/41126. The synthesis of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diones-as orally available LHRH receptor antagonists is described by S. Sasaki et al., in J. Med. Chem. 46,113-124 (2003).<br>
Novel 1-arylmethyl-5-aryl-6-methyluracils are described by Z. Guo et al., in J. Med. Chem. 47, 1259-1271 (2004). The preparation of N-[(hetero)arylmethyl]benzene-sulfonamides as potent non-peptide LHRH receptor antagonists is disclosed in WO 03/078398. The patent application WO 02/11732 describes tricyclic pyrrolidines as LHRH receptor antagonists. Substituted pyridin-4-ones as LHRH receptor antagonists are disclosed in WO 03/13528 and substituted 1,3,5-triaziner2,4,6-trioneS in WO 03/11839.<br>
The syntheses and biological activities of erythromycin A derivatives having LHRH receptor antagonistic activity is described by J. T. Randolph et al., in J. Med. Chem. 47(5), 1085-1097 (2004). Selected derivatives show an oral activity on the LH level in the castrated rats model.<br>
Quinoline derivatives as non-peptide LHRH antagonists are disclosed for example in WO 97/14682. Substituted 2-arylindoles are described inter alia in WO 97/21435, WO 97/21703, WO 98/55116, WO 98/55470, WO 98/55479, ' WO 99/21553, WO 00/04013 as LHRH receptor antagonists. Correspondingly substituted aza-2-arylindoles are claimed inter alia in WO 99/51231, WO 99/51596, WO 00/53178 and WO 00/53602 as LHRH receptor antagonists! Advantageous biological or biophysical data for these compounds are not disclosed.<br>
The patent EP 0 679 642 B1 describes fused heterocyclic compounds as LHRH receptor antagonists. The basic tetrahydrocarbazole structure is, however, not the subject matter of the invention described therein.<br>
1,2,3,4-Tetrahydrocarbazolecarboxylic acids are described in the patent EP 0 239 306 B1 as prostaglandin antagonists. An LHRH receptor antagonistic effect is neither described nor obvious. US patent 3,970,757 discloses tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives as gastric anti-secretory agents. However, an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect of this type of structure is neither described nor obvious. EP 603 432 B1 and US 5,708,187 describe tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives as 5-HT1 agonists inter alia for the treatment of migraine.<br>
6<br><br>
However, an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect is neither described nor obvious. WO 2005/033099 A2 describes tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives as dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors. However, an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect is-neither described nor obvious. There is no reference to an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect, and the disclosed structures differ from the compounds of the present invention. D. J. Davies et al. describe in-J. Med. Chem. 41; 451^467 (1998) tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives having a melatonin agonistic or antagonistic effect. However, an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect is neither described . nor obvious. Tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives are: described by S.J. Shuttle worth et al. in B/borg. Med. Chem. Lett. 14, 3037-3042 (2004) as partial : agonists of the neuromedin B receptor. However, an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect is neither described nor obvious. R. Millet et al. describe in Letters in Peptide Science 6, 221-233 (1999) tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives as NK1/NK2 ligands. The disclosed structures differ from the compounds of the present invention. Moreover, an LHRH receptor antagonistic effect'is neither described nor obvious. Solid-phase synthesis of 3-amino-3'-carboxytetrahydrocarbazoles is in Koppitz et'al., THL 46(6); 911-914 (2005). An LHRH receptor antagonistic effect is,neither described! nor obvious.<br>
Tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives as peptidomimetic LHRH receptor antagonists having good receptor affinity are disclosed for example in WO 03/051837 (DE 101 64 564 A1). The physicochemical and metabolic properties of these compounds do not, however, make them suitable in an optimal manner for an oral dosage form..<br>
A number of publications provide an overview of the state of development of neurokinin antagonists. G. Giardina et al., IDrugs 6(8), 758-772 (2003), provide an overview of the current patent literature. V. Leroy et al., Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs 9(4), 735-746 (2000), and C. Swain et al, Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry 34, 51-60 (1999) describe the state of development relating to neurokinin1 receptor antagonists, while, for example, R.M. Navari et al., Cancer Investigation 22(4) 569-576 (2004) describes the results of clinical studies in which NK1 receptor antagonists were employed to control chemotherapy-induced emesis. R.G. Hill et al. describe in Pain, 1523-530 (2003) neurokinin receptor antagonists as potential analgesics, while A. von Sprecher et al. in IDrugs 1(1), 73-91 (1998), describe neurokinin receptor antagonists as potential active • ingredients for the therapy of inflammations and rheurnatoid arthritis;. R. Millet et'al.<br>
describe in Letters in Peptide Science 6, 221-233 (1999)r tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives as NK1/NK2 ligands. The disclosed structures differ from the compounds of the present invention.<br>

unsaturated hydrocarbons having C1-C12 carbon atoms, which may be straight-chain or branched. The term "alkyl" preferably stands for alkyl chains of 1 to 8, particularly preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms. Examples of suitable alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, tert-pentyl, 2- or 3-methyl-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, nrundecyl, n-dodecyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl and yoctadienyl. The term' "alkyl" likewise stands for a saturated or partially unsaturated cycloalkyl radical,  preferably from the group of<br>
cyclo(C3-C8)alkyl. Examples of suitable cycloalkyl radicals.are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br>
cyclopentyl,    cyclohexyl,    cycloheptyl,    cyclooctyl,   cyclohexenyl,    cyclopentenyl,<br>
cyclooctadienyl and others. In addition, the term "alkyl" includes cycloalkylalkyl groups, with preference for the cyclo(C3-C8)alkyl-(C1-C4)alkyll radical. Examples thereof are cyclopropylmethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, cyclopentylethyl, cyclohexenylethyl. Thus, the term C1-C4alkyl includes at least the following groups: methyl;! ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, propenyl, cyclopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopropylmethyl, and butenyl. Particularly preferred as C1C4alkyl are isopropyl, sec-butyl, and cyclopropylmethyl.<br>
Such alkyl radical may be unsubstituted or optionally also mono- or polysubstituted, where the substituents may be identical or different and be bonded in each or more than one desired and possible position of the alkyl. In the case of a mono- or poly-halogen-substituted, alkyl radical, substitution with fluorine and/or chlorine atoms is preferred. Examples of such radicals are fluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl.<br>
"Aryl" refers to aromatic hydrocarbon systems having 3 to 14, preferably 5 to 14, carbon atoms, which may also be fused to further saturated, (partially) unsaturated or aromatic ring systems. Examples of "aryl" are inter, alia phenyls, naphthyls and anthracenyls, but also indanyls, indenyls, or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyls; phenyl is particularly preferred for the purposes of the present invention. Such -aryl radical may be unsubstituted or optionally also mono- or polysubstituted, where the substituents may be identical or different and be bonded in each or more than one desired and possible position of the aryl.<br>
."Heteroaryl" refers to a5-, 6- or 7-membered cyclic aromatic radical which comprises at<br>
least 1, where appropriate also 2, 3, 4 or 5, heteroatoms, preferably nitrogen, oxygen<br>
arid/or sulfur, where the heteroatoms are identical or different. The number of N atoms<br>

11<br><br>
and 1. The term "heteroaryl" also includes systems in which the heterpcycle is part of a<br>
bi- or polycyclic system, it being possible for the linkage of the heteroaryl radical to the<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) to take place via any desired and possible ring<br>
member of the heteroaryl radical. Examples of "heteroaryl" include pyrrolyl, thienyl,<br>
furyl,   imidazolyl,   thiazolyl,   isothiazolyl,   oxazolyl,   isoxazolyl,   pyrazolyl,   pyridinyl,<br>
pyrimidinyl, pyrazihyl, indolyl, quinolinyl, and isoquinolinyl. Such heteroaryl radicals<br>
may be unsubstituted or optionally mono- or polysubstituted, where the substituents<br>
.may be identical or different and be bonded in each or more than one desired and<br>
possible position of the heteroaryl.<br>
"Arylalkyl" or "heteroarylalkyl” refer to radicals in which the aryl or heteroaryl radical is linked via a C1.C8-alkyI group to the compound of the general formula (I), where the alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl groups have the meanings defined above. Preferred "arylalkyl" groups are phenyl-C1-C4alkyl radicals, preferably benzyl or phenylethyl radicals.<br>
A "ring system" refers to a mono- or polycyclic system of 3 to 14, preferably 5 or 6 to 14<br>

ring system, may be saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated or entirely or partly aromatic,<br>
and in the case of a ring system consisting of at least two rings the rings may be fused<br>
or spiro- or otherwise connected.<br>
As mentioned above in connection with the general formula (I), the compounds of the invention may, because they have at least one center of asymmetry, exist in the form of their racemates; in the form of the pure enantiomers and/or diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of these enantiomers and/or diastereomers.

Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention, of the general formula (1) which have one or more centers of chirality and which occur as racemates or as diastereomer mixtures can be fractionated by methods known per se into their optical pure isomers, i.e. enantiomers or diastereomers. The separation of the compounds of the invention or their building blocks (amino acids) can. take place by column separation on chiral or nonchiral phases or by recrystallization from an optionally optically active solvent or with use of an optically active acid or base or by derivatization with an optically active<br>
13<br><br>
reagent such as, for example, an optically active alcohol, and subsequent elimination of the radical.<br>

It is known that chemical substances form solids which exist in different order states which are referred to as polymorphic forms or modifications, the various modifications of a polymorphic substance may differ greatly in their physical properties. The<br>
14<br><br>
compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I,' la and lb) can exist in various polymorphic forms, and certain modifications may moreover be metastable. All these polymorphic forms of the compounds of the general formulae^!, la and lb) are to be regarded as belonging to the invention.<br>
It is likewise possible for the compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) to be in the form of any desired prodrugs such as, for example, esters, carbonates or. phosphates, in which cases the actually biologically active form is released only through metabolism.<br>
It is known that chemical substances are converted in the body into metabolites which may where appropriate likewise elicit the desired biological effect - in some circumstances even in more pronounced form.<br>
It is known for thioamides (X1 = S) for example (Casarett &amp; Doull's "Toxicology, the Basic Science of Poisons", Chapter 6: Biotransformation of Xenobiotics, CD. Klaassen Ed., McGraw-Hill 2001; DM. Clayton, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 1978, 6(1), 94-96) that they can also be metabolized to thioamide S-oxides. These substances can also be obtained by synthesis from the corresponding thioamides by oxidation with hydrogen superoxide (H202) (J.R. Cashman et at., J. Org. Chem., 1982, 47.(24), 4645-4650). Thus<br>
 compound 68 is oxidized for example to (R)-8-chloro-6-fluoro-3-{(S)-2-[2-(2-fluorophenyl)acetylamino]-3-methylpentanoylamino}-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-3-carboxylic acid ((SJ-2-methyl-1-thiocarbamoylbuty!)amide S-oxide, and compound 76' is oxidized to (R)-3-{(S)-2-[2-(2-fluorophenyl)acetylamino]-3-methylpentanoylamino}-8-trifluoromethyl-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1 H-carbazole-3-carboxylic acid ((S)-2-methyl-1 -thio-carbamoylbutyl)amide S-oxide.<br>

The abovementioned compounds 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30, 31, 34, 37, 45, 48, 52, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74; 75 and 76 are<br>
moreover very particularly preferred.<br>
The novel tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) as defined above are GPGR ligands. Thus, the aforementioned Compounds of the invention are suitable for, the treatment and prophylaxis of pathological states mediated by GPCR, and of pathological states which can be influenced by modulation of this receptor, and thus treated, the compounds of the invention can be employed in particular for the inhibition, i.e. as antagonist, of the LHRH receptor or of receptors of the neurokinin family, especially the NIK, and/or NK2 receptor, and are thus suitable for example for the treatment of benigriarid malignant neoplastic diseases, for the treatment and prevention of nausea and vomiting, for example as a consequence of mesogenic chemotherapy, for the treatment of pain, inflammations and rheumatic and arthritic pathological conditions, in male fertility control, for hormone therapy, in hormone replacement therapy and for the treatment and/or control of female sub- or infertility.<br>
In male fertility control, the compounds of the invention bring about a reduction in spermatogenesis. Combined administration with androgens, e.g. ; testosterone or testosterone derivatives, such as, for example, testosterone esters, is preferred. The testosterone derivatives can in this case be administered for example by injection, e.g. by intramuscular depot injection.<br>
The compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) can also be employed in female hormone therapy, for example for the treatment of benign hormone-dependent disorders such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, uterine myomas (uterine leiomyomas), endometrium hyperplasia, dysmenorrhea, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding (menorrhagia, metrorrhagia), where appropriate in combination with other hormones, e.g. estrogens or/and progestins. Particularly preferred are combinations of the LHRH receptor antagonists of the invention and tissue-selective partial estrogen agonists such as raloxifene®.<br>
25<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can also be employed in hormone replacement therapy, for example for treating hot flushes.<br>
The compounds of the invention of-the general formulae (I, la and lb) can moreover be employed to control female fertility, for example by switching off the endogenous hormone cycle for controlled induction of ovulation ("COS = controlled ovarian stimulation"), and for the treatment of sterility within the scope of assisted reproduction techniques such as in-vitro fertilization ("IVF")/<br>
On the other hand, the novel compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) are also suitable for female contraception. Thus, an LHRH receptor antagonist of the invention can be administered on days 1 to 15 of the female cycle together with estrogen, preferably with very low estrogen dosages. On days 16 to 21 of the cycle of intake, progestagen is added, to the combination of estrogen and LHRH receptor antagonist. The LHRH receptor antagonist of the invention can be administered continuously throughout the cycle. It is possible in this way to achieve a reduction in the hormone dosage and thus a reduction in the side effects of nonphysiological hormone levels. It is additionally possible to achieve advantageous effects in women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome and androgen-dependent disorders such as acne, seborrhea and hirsutism. An improved cycle control compared with previous administration methods is also to be expected.<br>
Further indications are benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), gonadal protection during chemotherapy, developmental disturbances in early childhood, e.g.-pubertas praecox, the treatment of HIV infections or AIDS and of neurological or neurodegenerative disorders, ARC (AIDS related complex), Kaposi sarcoma, tumors originating in the brain and/or nervous system and/or meninges (cf. WO 99/01764), dementia and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Finally, the compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb), as defined above can also be employed for the treatment of malignant hormone-dependent neoplastic diseases such as premenopausal breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer and endometrial cancer, since they suppress endogenous sex steroid hormones, and in addition are also suitable for the treatment and prevention of nausea and vomiting, for example resulting from emetogenic chemotherapy, or for the treatment of pain, inflammations and rheumatic and arthritic pathological conditions.<br>
26<br><br>
The novel Compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) as defined above are suitable as GPCR ligands, in particular LHRH receptor antagonists or antagonists of receptors of the neurokinin family, for the treatment of the aforementioned pathological conditions for administration to mammals and in particular humans, but also for veterinary medical purposes, e.g. in domestic and productive animals, but also in wild animals.<br>
The administration can take place in a known manner, for example orally or non-orally, in particular topically, rectally, intravaginally, nasally or by injections or implantation. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The novel compounds of the.invention of the general formulae (I,' la and lb) are converted into a form which can be administered arid are mixed where appropriate with pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers or diluents. Suitable excipients and carriers are described for. example in Ullman's Encyclopedia of Technical Chemistry, Vol. 4, (1953), 1-39; Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 52 (1963), 918 et seq.;H. v. Czetsch-Lindenwald, "Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie and angrenzende Gebiete"; Pharm. Ind. 2, 1961, 72 et seq.; Dr. H.P. Fiedler, "„Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik and angrenzende Gebiete", Cantor KG, Aulendorf in Wurttemberg, 1971.<br>
Oral administration can, take place for example in solid form as tablet, capsule, gel capsule, coated tablet, granulation or powder, but also in the form of a drinkable solution. The novel compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) as defined above can for oral administration be. combined with known and ordinarily used, physiologically tolerated excipients and carriers such as, for example, gum arabic, talc, starch, sugars such as, for example, mannitol, methylcellulose, lactose, gelatin, surface-active agents, magnesium stearate, cyclodextrins, aqueous or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, dispersants,' emulsifiers, lubricants, preservatives and flavorings (e.g. essential oils). The compounds of the invention can also be dispersed in a microparticulate, e.g. nanoparticulate, composition.<br>
Non-oral administration can take place for example by, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular injection of sterile aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions or emulsions, by means of implants or by ointments, creams or suppositories. Administration as sustained release form is also possible where appropriate. Implants may comprise inert materials, e.g. biodegradable polymers or synthetic silicones such as, for example, silicone rubber.<br>
27<br><br>
Intravaginal administration is possible for example by means of vaginal rings. Intrauterine administration is possible for example by means of diaphragms or other suitable intrauterine devices. Transdermal administration is additionally provided, in particular by means of a formulation-suitable for this purpose and/or suitable means such as, for example, patches.<br>
As already explained above, the novel compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb)can also be combined with other active pharmaceutical ingredients. It is possible for the purposes of the combination therapy to administer the individual active ingredients simultaneously or separately, in particular either by the same route (e.g.' orally) or by separate routes (e.g. orally and as injection). They may be present and administered in identical or different amounts in a unit dose. It is also possible to use a ! particular dosage regimen when this appears appropriate. It is also possible in this way to combine a plurality of the novel compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) with one another.<br>
The dosage may vary within a wide range depending on the type of indication, or the severity of the disorder, the mode of administration, the age, gender, bodyweight and sensitivity of the subject to be treated. It is within the ability of a skilled worker to determine a "pharmacologically effective amount" of the combined pharmaceutical composition. Administration can take place in a single dose or a plurality of separate dosages.<br>
A suitable unit dose is, for example, from 0.001 mg to 100 mg of the active ingredient, i.e. at least one compound of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) and, where appropriate, a further active ingredient, per kg of a patient's bodyweight.<br>

The compounds of the invention of the general formulae (I, la and lb) as defined above can be prepared for example in.the following way:<br>
Firstly, the compounds of the invention can be synthesized by preparing the depicted central tetrahydrocarbazole structure<br><br>
H2N&gt;<f oh></f>
where this optionally protected tetrahydrocarbazole structure already contains the substituents R4 to R7 - where appropriate as precursors or in protected form.<br>
The central tetrahydrocarbazole; structure is obtainable, for example, by a Fischer indole synthesis, known per se. For this purpose, a suitably substituted cyclohexanone derivative which is provided where appropriate with protective groups is condensed with the particular desired phenylhydrazine derivative which is likewise suitably substituted and, where appropriate, provided with protective groups (e.g. as described by Britten &amp; Lockwood, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 11974, 1824 or Maki et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1973, 21, 240). The cyclohexane structure is substituted in the 4,4' position by the radicals -COOH and -NH2 or where appropriate by the (protected) precursors thereof. The phenylhydrazine structure is substituted where appropriate by the radicals R4 to R7. Phenylhydrazine derivatives which are not commercially available can be prepared by processes known to the skilled worker. Positional isomers resulting where appropriate in the condensation of the cyclohexanone derivative and the<br>
32<br><br>
.phenylhydrazine derivative can be separated by chromatographic methods such as, for example, HPLC.<br>
'The radicals R10R9NCHR8CX3NH-. and R1R2NCX1HRaNHCX2- 'can in principle be |introduced and modified in various ways depending on their nature by processes known to the skilled worker, as indicated for example in WO 03/051837 by means of examples and general explanations.<br>
Another process for synthesizing the compounds of the invention: of. the general formulae (I, la and ib) is the following:<br>
Firstly a basic tripeptide structure is prepared by coupling three suitable amino acids, the first amino acid AA1 comprising the radical R3 as side chain and the third amino acid AA3 comprising the radical R8 or a precursor of R8 as side chain, while the "middle" amino acid AA2 is 3-amino-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1-H-carbazole-3-carboxylic acid (abbreviated to The). The basic The structure can be correspondingly substituted, depending on the substitution pattern of the desired resulting compound of the invention, by the radicals R4 to R7, where appropriate iii the form of their precursors or in protected form: the peptide coupling can be carried put by processes known to the skilled worker, e.g. in the solid or liquid phase. Modifications of the substitution pattern can then be undertaken,'such as "deprotectibn" of particular radicals.<br>
The following scheme illustrates the coupling of the amino &gt;acids for example on the solid phase:<br>

3<br>
is substituted by up to three, preferably by one OH group/or R8* may also - in accordance With the definitions given for R8 - have the meaning of R3.<br>
e) Where R* = Fmoc, the product obtained in step d is initially deprotected and the terminal free amino group is then reacted so as to introduce the radical R10:<br><br><br><br>

Depending on the nature of R10, different processes are used: , (i)     method 1Af for R'10 = -C0-R11; reaction with R11-COOH<br>
* (ii) method 1Ag for R10 = -CO-OR11; reaction with R11-OSu; in this case it is likewise possible,- if R8* has a free OH group, for this OH group to be converted into -0-CO-0-R13, in which case R11 and R13 are identical radicals . •<br>

(iii)    method 1Ah for.R10 =-R11; reaction with R10-iodide (R10-l)<br>

II. Demonstration of the LHRH antagonistic effect of compounds of the invention<br>
II.1A LHRH receptor-ligand binding assay (membrane preparations from rat pituitary cells)<br>
Assay<br>
Heterologous competition experiments were carried out using membrane preparations from rat pituitary cells which naturally strongly express the LHRH receptor. The ligand used in this case was [125I][D-Trp6]-LHRH in a concentration of 0.05 nM.- Unlabeled [D-Trp6]-LHRH was used in a concentration of 1uM, or the test substancewas used in the desired Concentration, for competition. After an incubation time of 90 minutes at 4°C, the bound ligand was measured by scintillation (Halmos et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996, 93, 2398).<br>
Evaluation<br>
The result obtained was the percentage proportion of bound ligand in the presence of the competitor related to the specifically bound proportion of the control (see result for selected compounds in Table 3). EC5o values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of the competition plots.<br>

j<br>
1MB    LHRH receptor-ligand binding assay (transfected LTK cells)<br>
Materials:<br>
125l-Triptorelin [125l-(D)-Trp6-GnRH] was purchased from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany)! The specific activity was in each case 2.13 Ci/mmol.<br>
All other chemicals are purchased from commercial sources in the highest purity : available.<br>
Cell culture:<br>
LTK" cells (mouse fibroblasts: ATCC No. CCL-1.3) which have been transfected with the rat LHRH receptor are cultivated in DMEM medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Germany) with penicillin (1001.U./ml)/ streptomycin (0.1. mg/ml) and glutamine (0.01 mol/l) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Germany) on plastic tissue culture plates (Nunc, Germany, 245 x 245 x 20 mm).<br>
Testing:<br>
80% confluent cell culture plates are washed twice with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then detached with 0:01 M EDTA solution. The cells are pelleted by centrifugation at 200xg for 5 min in a laboratory centrifuge (Kendro, Germany). The cell pellet is resuspended in 3 ml of binding medium (DMEM; 10 mM Hepes; 0.5% BSA; 0.1% NaN3; 1 g/l bacitracin (add fresh, stock 100x); 0.1 g/ISBTI (add fresh, stock 1000x) and the cell count is determined by Trypan blue staining in a Neubauer counting chamber. The cell suspension is adjusted with binding medium to a* concentration of 5 x 105 cells/0,05 ml.<br>
Binding studies for competition plots are carried out as duplicates. The test substances are employed.as 10 mM DMSO solutions. They are diluted to 4 times the final concentration employed with binding medium. 25 |il of the substance dilution are mixed 'with 25 ul of tracer solution (125l-triptprelin or 125l-cetrorelix). The tracer concentration is adjusted to approx. 50 000 cpm (measured in a Cobra II, y counter, PE Liefe Science, Germany) in the final reaction volume of 100 pi.<br>
68<br><br>
200 μ of silicone/liquid paraffin mixture (84%: 16%) are introduced into 650 pi conical tubes (Roth, Germany). 50 pi of the cell suspension are pipetted thereon, followed by 50 pi of the test substance/tracer mixture. The tubes are-capped and incubated with vertical rotation in an incubator at 37°C for 60 min. After incubation, the samples are centrifuged in a centrifuge (Kendro, Germany) at 900 rpm and subsequently shock-frozen in liquid N2.-The tip with the cell pellet is cut off and transferred into prepared, counting vials (Roth, Germany). The remainder of the conical tube with the remaining supernatant is likewise transferred into a counting vial. The measurement takes place in a Y counter for 1 min/sample.<br>
Evaluation of the samples takes place after calculation of the specific binding compared with untreated cells, after subtraction of the nonspecific binding (excess of unlabeled ligand, 1 μM) by means of GraphPad Prism or alternatively by means of OMMM software.<br>

11.2      Inhibition of LHRH-induced LH secretion from rat pituitary cells in vitro<br>
Materials<br>
The LH concentration in cell culture supernatants was measured using the rat luteinizing hormone (rLH) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system ELISA (RPN 2562) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals used Were from commercial sources in the highest purity available.<br>
Cell culture<br>
■Juvenile male Wistar rats (Harlan Winkelmann, Germany) were" sacrificed by -decapitation, and the pituitaries were removed and taken up in Hanks' buffer (HBSS) with 0.3% BSA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Pituitaries from 20 rats were required to carry out one experiment. The cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary were separated from the remaining tissue by incubation in Hanks' buffer with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.3% BSA, 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (type VIII), 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 ug/ml DNAsel and 1 mg/ml papain at 37°C for 30 minutes. A sterile Pasteur pipette was used to disperse the cells, and they were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were seeded in a density of 2.5 x105 cells/well of a collagen-coated 48-well plate (Becton Dickinson) in DMEM medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Germany) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Germany), 10 ml/l nonessential amino acids and 10 ml/l Pen/Strep (penicillin/streptomycin).<br>
Assay<br>
The medium was changed after incubation at 37°C, 5% C02 and 95% humidity for 48 h. The medium was replaced by LHRH-containing (10 nM) medium or medium with LHRH (10 nM). and test substance in the concentration indicated (table). After a further incubation for 3 hours, the cell supernatant was harvested and frozen at -20°C. The LH content was determined by means of ELISA in triplicate determination in accordance with the manufacturer's (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) instructions.<br>
In the following table, "% Inhibition" describes the quotient of LHRH-stimulated LH secretion with ("LH (ng/ml)" and without the addition of the test substance. The values originate from different, independent experiments.<br>

i11.3      LH concentration suppression in the plasma of castrated rats<br>
Materials<br>
The LH concentration in the plasma of castrated rats was measured using the rat luteinizing hormone (rLH) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system ELISA (RPN 2562) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or of LH RIA - AH R002 rats; from Biocode-Hycel, Liege, Belgium. All other chemicals used were from commercial sources in the highest purity available.<br>
Animals<br>
10 days before the start of the test, male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Winkelmann, Germany) weighing 190-220 g were anesthetized with ether and castrated and provided with a silicone catheter for permanent blood sampling.<br>
Assay<br>
At the start of the test, before administration of the substance, blood samples were taken and the LH level determined. The substance was then administered orally in the desired concentration. The number of animals used in each group was 8. At the stated times, further blood samples were taken. The blood was collected in heparinized sample tubes on ice, and the plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 minutes. The plasma samples were stored at -20°C until the LH concentration was measured by ELISA or RIA. The LH concentration was determined by an ELISA or RIA in  duplicate   determination   in   accordance  with   the   manufacturer's   (Amersham<br>
73<br><br>
Pharmacia Biotech; Biocode-Hycel) instructions.<br>
Evaluation and statistics<br>
Since the rats showed large differences in the individual LH concentrations, owing to<br>
the physiological pulsatile secretion of LH, the values before, treatment with the<br>
substance have been indicated as averages of the individual LH concentrations and<br>
correspond to the 100% value. All the other data points for each individual animal were<br>
