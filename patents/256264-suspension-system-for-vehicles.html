				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Suspension system comprises of an arrangement of linkages that ensure the angle between the wheels&#x27; axes does not change throughout the range of articulation. This arrangement provides ideal control over wheel camber. The stub axles may be steerable. The system may be supported by various types of springs and dampers and it may be mounted on a variety of chassis types. This suspension system combines the advantages of existing rigid axle and independent suspension systems. It precisely controls wheel camber like a rigid axle, but allows greater independence of articulation for the pair of wheels supported by the each axle, unlike a rigid axle setup.</td>

An Indian company having   its registered office<br>

Mumbai 400 001 Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to the suspension system for vehicles and more particularly it relates to the suspension system for maintaining constant camber angle for vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Vehicle suspension systems include various combinations of springs (coil, leaf, air or torsion bar), axle housing, torque arms, A-frames, anti-roll bars, stabilizers, shock absorbers etc. These components have been assembled in various combinations in an effort to produce the desired ride, handling and performance characteristics of the vehicle.<br>
Generally automotive suspension can be broadly categorized in to two types; one is rigid or non independent axle and second is independent axle. The latter offer advantages of primary unsprung weight, greater wheel travel and better packaging.<br>
However there are some limitations of the independent suspension systems, such as the problem of maintaining an optimum wheel camber. The suspension geometry is generally set up to optimize wheel camber during vehicle roll, which leads to undesired wheel tilt during pitching and during vertical displacement of the suspended vehicle. This becomes a serious problem with independent suspension systems incorporating large vertical travel of the wheels.<br>
It is important to keep the tread surface of a tyre flat on the road surface for optimum traction and performance and to reduce wear. Camber angle is critical to tire traction and to vehicle handling and performance. The suspension<br><br><br>
linkages control the camber angle. It is desirable to keep the camber angle zero or near zero at all times to optimize road handling and performance. On the other hand, wheel camber is fixed in suspensions featuring rigid axles. These systems are generally simpler and tougher than most independent suspension designs. These attributes favour their use in on road/off road heavy vehicles and utility vehicles.<br>
One of the prior art related to this invention is the swing half-axle suspension used primarily by tetra (Czech truck manufacturer) and other is Pinzgauer (off road utility vehicle of Austrian origin).<br>
According to swing half axle suspension system, the system features a central load carrying backbone tube chassis, on to which swing half axles are pivoted. This arrangement provides all round independent suspension. The vehicle superstructure is mounted on the central tube chassis. Suspension is provided by torsion bars in the case of single axle sets and leaf spring bogie type sets for twin axles.<br>
This system, though superbly suited to off road applications suffers from extreme variation of wheel camber when undergoing vertical displacement. The vehicle chassis mounting height is also limited by tyre diameter and axle hub design. Both these limitations are overcome in the proposed suspension system.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide suspension system which maintains constant camber angle of the wheels.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide suspension system which provides better traction.<br><br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide suspension system which provides better tyre life.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
SUSPENSION SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES<br>
Suspension system comprises of an arrangement of linkages that ensure the angle between the wheels' axes does not change throughout the range of articulation. This arrangement provides ideal control over wheel camber.<br>
The stub axles may be steerable. The system may be supported by various types of springs and dampers and it may be mounted on a variety of chassis types.<br>
This suspension system combines the advantages of existing rigid axle and independent suspension systems. It precisely controls wheel camber like a rigid axle, but allows greater independence of articulation for the pair of wheels supported by the each axle, unlike a rigid axle setup.<br>
