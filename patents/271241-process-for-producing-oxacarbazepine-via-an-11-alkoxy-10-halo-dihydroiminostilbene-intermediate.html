				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention in general relates to the process for producing 10-oxo-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[6,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (oxcarbazepine). In particular the present invention provides a novel ititermediate to produce oxcarbazepine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10-Oxo-10,11 -dihydro-5H-dibenz[6,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (oxcarbazepine), a compound of formula I, is used in therapy as an anticonvulsant. It has a depressant effect on the central nervoxis system. Also it has been used for the treatment of psychosomatic disturbances, epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia and for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and/or Parkinsonian syndromes.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Various methods for preparing oxcarbazepine have been described in the prior art.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,642,775 describes the synthesis of oxcarbazepine [I] from a compound of formula II by reaction with phosgene in toluene followed by amidation (ethanol and ammonia) to give 10-metfaoxyiminostilbene (MISB) [III]. Hydrolysis of MISB [111] with dilute mineral acid gives the desured product oxcarbazepine [I],<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The main disadvantage of this process is the use of phosgene, a toxic and hazardous substance and is therefore impractical in commercial scale.<br>
Canadian Pat. No. 1,112,241 describes the synthesis of oxcarbazepine from the catalysed re-arrangement of 10,11-epoxycarbazepine [V], which itself can be prepared from carbamezapine [IV] by reaction with m-chloroperbenzoic acid.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The main drawback of this process is the use of carbamazepine as a reagent, which is an expensive raw material. Furthermore, the epoxidation reaction is substrate sensitive and thus gives low yields when using conventional epoxidants such as peracetic acid, or it requires remarkable excesses of expensive reagents such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Moreover, the rearrangement reaction requires large amoimts of costly catalysts and is difficuh to control, thus requiring thorough purifications and hence low yields.<br>
European Pat. No. 028028 describes the synthesis of oxcarbazepine from 5-cyanoiminostilbene [VII] (by reaction of iminostilbene [VI] with cyanogen chloride) through nitration, reduction and hydrolysis.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The main drawback of this process is the use of cyanogen chloride, a difficult to handle toxic gas; nitration using nitrating agents such as N2O3 and N2O4, which are difficult to use and hydrolysis of cyano group using BF3 complexes, which are expensive and difficult to handle.<br>
Swiss Pat. No. 642,950 describes the synthesis of oxcarbazepine starting from a compound of formula X followed by halogenation, treatment with alkali metal alkoxide and acid hydrolysis.<br>
(Formulas Removed)<br>
The main drawback of this invention is the use of bromine/chlorine gas for the bromination/chlorination step, which are hazardous and are difficult to handle at commercial scale. Moreover, the conversion of Xni to XIV requires deadly toxic phosgene gas.<br>
According to U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,058, oxcarbazepine [I] can be prepared by the carbamoylation of MISB [II] using an alkali metal cyanate like sodium cyanate and a relatively strong organic or inorganic acid, followed by the hydrolysis of the enol-ether group xmder mild acidic conditions.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The major drawback of this process is that during carbamoylation reaction, hydrolysis of the enol-ether group of the compound of formula II also occurs, to give the corresponding ketone of the formula XVI. The ketone of formula XVI will not undergo any further reaction with metal cyanate and strong mineral acid such as 98% sulfuric acid, 98% anhydrous hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acids in acetic acid, formic acid etc. to give the corresponding oxcarbazepine [I], thus, producing a mixture of products and related impurities, which requires tedious and uneconomical purification methods and thus low yield of oxcarbazepine.<br>
US Pat. No. 6,670,472 assigned to Jubilant Organosys describes the synthesis of oxcarbazepine [I], by reacting 10-methoxyiminostilbene of formula [II] with an alkali metal cyanate and a mild acidic reagent, followed by the hydrolysis with a dilute mineral acid.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
US Pat. Application No. US20050282797 describes the synthesis of oxcarbazepine by<br>
reacting oximinostilbene [XVI] with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in an inert organic<br>
solvent to give the intermediate of formula [XVII], which on hydrolysis gives<br>
oxcarbazepine [I].	.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The major drawback of this reaction is that preparation of oximinostilbene [XVI] requires harsh conditions and involves a tedious work-up procedure. Moreover, chlorosulfonyl isocyanate is an expensive, highly moisture sensitive and toxic reagent and also the reaction with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate and subsequent hydrolysis requires a relatively comphcated isolation procedure and thus gives a low overall yield.<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
PCX hitemational Application no. WO/2005/066133 to Parkenky et al. discloses the process for preparation of Oxcarbazepine via novel intermediate. The process comprising preparing an intermediate 10-methoxy-5H-dibez[b,f(azepine-5 carbonylchloride from 10-methoxyiminostilbene (II) using bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate (BTC) or triphosgene and an appropriate organic base and further converting said intermediate to the 10-methoxy-5H-dibenz [b,f) azepine-5-carboxamide using ammonia in organic solvent and resultant 10-methoxy-5H-dibenz [b,f] azepine-5-carboxamide is converted into Oxcarbazepine in the presence of lewis acids in appropriate organic solvent. The drawback of this invention is the use of toxic phosgene gas and the multi step reactions to get final product. pMe<br>

Example 5 Preparation of 10-oxo-10,l l-dihyidro-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (oxcarbazepine), compound of formula [I]<br>
10-Methoxyiminostilbene, compoimd of formula [XX], (100 g) was dissolved in toluene (1000 ml). Sodium cyanate (100 g) and benzoic acid (190 g) were added and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred and heated at 85-90°C for 10 h. After the reaction completion, the reaction mixture was cooled, followed by the addition of aqueous NaOH solution (10%, 800 ml) to pH 11. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at this temperature followed by cooling to 0-5°C. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with toluene and water and dried to give the compound of formula [XXI] (yield = 110 g).<br>
The crude [XXI] was taken in a RB flask and methanol (600 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux. The reaction mixture was cooled, methanol was distilled off and toluene (50 ml) was added and further distilled. The residual [XXI] was cooled and toluene (500 ml) was added and stirred. Water was added followed by addition of cone. HCl. The reaction mixture was heated at 75-80°C. The reaction mixtvire was cooled and the crude oxcarbazepine [I] was filtered, washed with toluene, 5% NaHCO3 and DM water and vacuum dried to give crude oxcarbazepine of formula [I] (yield = 82 g). The oxcarbazepine thus formed can be purified by dissolving in methanol (600 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred for 15-20 min. The pH of the<br>
reaction mixture was maintained in the range of 7.5-8.5. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to reflux at 65-70°C for 2 h, and cooled, filtered and washed with methanol and dried to give oxcarbazepine [I], which was further purified by heating in methanol (1400 ml) and dichlormethane (1400 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 30 min and treated with activated carbon. The reaction mixture was filtered through Hyflo bed and washed with methanol and dichloromethane mixture (1:1). The solvent was distilled to residual volume of 1000 mL. The reaction mixture was cooled and maintained. The reaction mixture was filtered through buchner funnel and washed with methanol and dried under vacuum at 50-60°C to give pure oxcarbazepine (90 g).<br>
