				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to anti-inflammatory drugs, and more particularly to novel      compounds      which      inhibit      the      activity      of      cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Themetabolites of arachidonic acid, such as prostaglandins, lipoxygenases and thromboxane products are produced in a wide variety of tissues and play a key role in several biological responses. Prostaglandins mediate both beneficial and undesirable biological reactions. The production of prostaglandins induces pain, swelling, heat and redness which are characteristic features of inflammation. The chronic inflammation associated withprostaglandin production leads to the breakdown of the injured tissue and angiogenesis. In pathologic chronic inflammation, normal tissues can be destroyed and the new blood vessel formation can support growth of anormal tissue.Prostaglandins are also important for normal physiological processes in different organs. In the stomach, prostaglandins protect mucosa from acid. They also regulate<br>
blood flow and salt-water balance in the kidney. Prostaglandins are also important in platelets aggregation and participate in memory and other cognitive functions.<br>
Prostaglandins are produced from cell membrane phospholipids by a cascade of enzymes. The enzymatic activities involve release of arachidonic acid from the cell membrane by phospholipase A2, followed by the conversion of arachidonic acid to a common prostaglandin precursor, PGH2, by cyclooxygenase (also called prostaglandin H synthase). PGH2 is finally converted to various types of prostaglandins (PGEâ€ž PGE2, PGI2 or prostacyclin, PGF20 and thromboxane) by cell-specific synthases.<br>
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the formation of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity. They have analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory activities. However, chronic treatment with the available NSAIDs often leads to disruption of beneficial prostaglandin-mediated processes. The side effects associated with constant usage of NSAIDs include gastrointestinal (Gl) irritation and formation of life-threatening Gl ulcers.<br>
A dramatic advance in the field of inflammation research came with discovery of multiple enzymes for each step of the prostaglandin synthase cascade. The research suggested that in some situations, such as inflammation, cyclooxygenase was inducible. The cyclooxygenase known at the time, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), was clearly non-inducible or modulated by glucocorticoids. A second, inducible form of cyclooxygenase known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was subsequently identified and cloned by several groups of investigators. COX-1 is the constitutive cyclooxygenase isoform and is mainly responsible for the synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the Gl tract and the synthesis of thromboxane which triggers platelet aggregation in blood platelets. COX-2 is inducible and short lived except in the case of certain tumors<br>
where it is constitutively activated. COX-2 expression is stimulated in response to endotoxins, cytokines, hormones, growth factors and mitogens. These observations suggest that COX-1 and COX-2 serve different physiological and pathophysiological functions. Indeed, it has been suggested that COX-1 is responsible for endogenous basal release of prostaglandins and hence is important to the physiological functions of prostaglandins such as Gl integrity and renal blood flow. On the other hand, it has been suggested that COX-2 is mainly responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins, where induction of the enzyme occurs in response to inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors and cytokines. See, U.S. Pat. 5,604,253, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the advantages of selective COX-2 inhibition. Principally, a selective COX-2 inhibitor is expected to possess similar antiinflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties to a conventional NSAID but with reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity, and a reduced potential for renal side effects.<br>
The differential tissue distribution of COX-1 and COX-2 provides an approach to develop selective inhibitors for COX-2 with reduced effect on COX-1, thereby preventing gastric side effects.<br>
A number of selective COX-2 inhibitors have been reported. These include diaryl heterocyclics (Penning etal., J. Med. Chem, 40,1347-1365 (1997); acetoxyphenyl alkyl sulfides (Kalgutkaref a/., J. Med. Chem, 41,4800-4818 (1998); methane sulfonamides (Li etal., J. Med. Chem, 38, 4897-4905 (1995); and tricyclic inhibitor classes (Wilkerson etal., J. Med. Chem., 38, 3895-3901 (1995). U.S. Pat. 5,604,253 discloses N-benzylindol-3-yl propanoic acid derivatives as cyclooxygenase inhibitors.<br>
What is needed are additional COX-2 inhibitors, particularly compounds which selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity of COX-2 over COX-1.<br>

The following are general procedures for preparation of the formula I compounds or intermediates thereof:<br>
I   Procedure 1:	Synthesis of trans-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-aryl-3-<br>
buten-2-one intermediate<br>
To a solution of 10% sodium hydroxide in ethanol (25 ml), 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (10 mmol) is added and stirred at 15-20Â°C. To this a solution of the appropriate araldehyde (10 mmol)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Z is defined as above, is added and stirred vigorously for 4 hrs. The temperature of the reaction is maintained at 15-20Â°C throughout the reaction. The solution is then poured into ice water and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting separated frans-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one of formula IV (X=CF3) is extracted with ether dried over anhydrous MgS04. Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields the fra/7s-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one which is purified by recrystallization.<br>
Procedure 1A:        Alternative    synthesis    of    frans-1,1,1-<br>
trifluoro-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one intermediate<br>
To a cooled solution of (-70Â°C) lithium diisopropylamide (10 mmol), diethyl methylphosphonate (5 mmol) is added. After the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at -70Â°C, N-phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl chloride (5 mmol) is gradually added and stirring is continued at -70Â°C for 1 hour. The appropriate araldehyde (5mmol)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Z is defined as above, is added dropwise for 10 minutes. The resulting mixture is warmed to room temperature over 2 hours and then<br>
stirred overnight. Then 20 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid is added and stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The solution is extracted thrice with diethyl ether (20 ml each time) and washed successively with 5% sodium bicarbonate and brine until the pH of the solution is 6. The ethereal layer is separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield crude trans -1,1,1 -trifluoromethyl-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one. The product is purified either by column chromatography or by recrystallization.<br>
The appropriate 1,1,1-trihaloacetone can be substituted for 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone in Procedure 1 to provide othertrans-1,1,1-trihalo-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one intermediate. Similarly, other N-phenyltrihaloacetimidoyl chlorides can be substituted for N-phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl chloride in Procedure 1A to produce other trans-1,1,1-trihalo-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one intermediates.<br>
Procedure 2:	Synthesis of frans-1 -(alkyl or optionally<br>
substituted    aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1 -one intermediate<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X is C1-C6 alkyl (20 mmol), or a radical of formula II<br>
wherein R3 and R4 are defined as above (10 mmol), is added and stirred at 15-20Â°C. To this a solution of the appropriate araldehyde (10 mmol)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Z is defined as above, is added and stirred vigorously for 4 hours. The temperature of the reaction is maintained at 15-20Â°C throughout the reaction. The solution is then poured into ice water and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting separated /rans-1-(alkyl or optionally substituted aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1-one of formula IV (X = C1-C6 alkyl, or radical of formula II) is extracted with ether dried over anhydrous MgS04. Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields the frans-1 -(alkyl or optionally substituted aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1-one, which is purified by distillation or recrystallization.<br>
Procedure 3:	Synthesis     of 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-<br>
trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline<br>
To a solution of a frans-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-aryl-3-butene-2-one (5 mmol) of formula IV (X = CF3) in absolute methanol is added 4-sulfamyl phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride (6 mmol). The mixture is refluxed with stirring overnight on a hot plate with a stirrer. The solution is cooled and poured onto crushed ice and solid material is separated by filtration. Recrystallization of the solid material with appropriate solvent yields the pure 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline of formula la:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Procedure 4:	Synthesis of 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-(alkyl or<br>
optionally    substituted    aryl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline<br>
To a solution of a frans-1-(alkyl or optionally substituted aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1-one (5 mmol) of formula IV in absolute methanol is added 4-sulfamyl phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride (6 mmol). The mixture is refluxed with stirring overnight on a hot plate with a stirrer. The solution is cooled and poured onto crushed ice and solid material is separated by filtration. Recrystallization of the solid material with appropriate solvent yields the pure 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-(alkyl or optionally substituted aryl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline of formula I, wherein X is defined as in Procedure 2.<br>
Procedure 5:	Synthesis      of N-[4-(5-Aryl-3-<br>
trifluromethylpyrazolin-1-yl)<br>
	phenylsulfonyl]acetamide<br>
    To a solution of a 1-(4-sulfamylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-<br>
pyrazoiine (10 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran   (40 ml), acetic anhydride (20<br>
mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (10 mmol) and triethylamine (11 mmol) is<br>
added and stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture<br>
is then poured into water (100 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The<br>
ethyl acetate layer is separated, washed successively with water, brine and<br>
then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.   The dried organic   layer is<br>
filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield crude N-[4-(5-<br>
aryl-3-trifIuromethylpyrazolin-1-yl)phenylsulfonyl]acetamide.<br>
Recrystallization from a mixed solvent yields a pure compound.<br>
Other sulfonamides may be prepared by substituting an anhydride of the formula<br>

Procedure 6:	Synthesis       of  N-[4-(5-Aryl-3-<br>
triflurom ethyl py razol i n-1 -y I) phenylsulfonyljacetamide sodium salt<br>
To a solution of N-[4-(5-aryl-3-trifluoromethylpyrazolin-1-yl) phenylsulfonyljacetamide (5 mmol) in ethanol (100ml), sodium hydroxide (5 mmol in 20 ml of water) is added and stirred for 5 hours. The solution is then concentrated in vacuum to give a solid hydrated sodium salt of 1-(4-sulfamylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline.<br>

neoplastic transformations and metastatic tumor growth and hence can be<br>
used in the treatment of cancer.   In particular, the present invention<br>
provides a method for treating or preventing a neoplasia that produces a<br>
prostaglandin in a subject in need of such treatment or prevention, the<br>
method comprises treating the subject with a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula I or V. The term "neoplasia" includes<br>
neoplasia that produce prostaglandins or express a cyclooxygenase,<br>
including both benign and cancerous tumors, growths and polyps.<br>
Neoplasias believed treatable with cyclooxygenase inhibitors are discussed<br>
in U. S. Pat. 5,972,986, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The compounds may be used to inhibit the growth or<br>
an established neoplasm, i.e., to induce regression, or to prevent or delay<br>
the onset of the neoplasm.<br>
According to U.S. Pat. 5,972,986, neoplasias that produce prostaglandins, and which are therefore believed treatable with the compounds of the invention, include brain cancer, bone cancer, epithelial cell-derived neoplasia (epithelial carcinoma) such as basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal cancer such as lip cancer, mouth cancer, esophageal cancer, small bowel cancer and stomach cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, pancreas cancer, ovary cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and skin cancer, such as squamous cell and basal cell cancers, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and other known cancers that effect epithelial cells throughout the body.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of angiogenesis-mediated disorders. Thus, a method for treating, inhibiting or delaying the onset of an angiogenesis-mediated disorder in a subject is provided comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention. Angiogenesis-mediated disorders which may be treatable with cyclooxygenase inhibitors are discussed in U. S. Pat. 6,025,353, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. According to U. S. Pat. 6,025,353, such disorders include, for example, metastasis, corneal graft rejection, ocular neovascularization, retinal neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroplasia, neovascular glaucoma, gastric ulcer, infantile hemaginomas, angiofibroma of the nasopharynx, avascular necrosis of bone, and endometriosis.<br>
The compounds may be administered by any route, including oral and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, rectal, or subcutaneous administration. The active agent is preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected on the basis of the selected route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>

Cyclooxygenase Enzyme Assay<br>
Compounds were tested for inhibitory activity against COX-1 and COX-2. The compounds of Examples 1 and 24 had the highest selectivity for inhibiting COX-2.<br>
Cyclooxygenase activity of ovine COX-1 (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc.) and human recombinant COX-2 (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc.) was assayed by a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method as follows. All inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a stock solution of 5mM. Human recombinant COX-2 (3 units) or ovine COX-1 (15 units) was incubated with inhibitors at several concentrations in a solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCI, pH7.8, 500 uM phenol and hematin for 90 to 120 minutes at room temperature (24Â°C). In controls, equal volumes of DMSO without drug were added to the incubation mixture. After incubation for 90-120 minutes, [1-14C]arachidonicacid (50uM, 51mCi/mmol) (DuPont NEN) was added and incubated at 37Â°C for 2 minutes. The reaction was terminated by extraction with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was transferred into a fresh tube and evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac vacuum dryer. The contents of the tubes were reconstituted in 20 ml of ethyl acetate and spotted on a TLC plate (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and developed in a mobile phase containing chloroform/methanol (95:5) at4Â°C. Radiolabeled prostanoid compounds (the products of COX enzymatic reaction with radiolabeled arachidonic acid substrate) were quantitated with a' radioactivity scanner (Fuji, Phosphorimager). The percentage of total products observed at different inhibitor concentrations was divided by the percentage of the products observed for protein samples pre incubated for the same time with DMSO. The results are shown in Table 4. The Example 1 and 2 compounds are more than one thousand times more active in inhibiting COX-2 compared to COX-1.<br>

(Formula &amp; Table Removed)<br>
Soft Agar Assay<br>
The Example 1 and 24 compounds were compared to the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in inhibiting the growth of DLD-1 cells in soft agar. DLD-1 cells are human colorectal carcinoma cells that overexpress COX-2. DLD-1 cells grow in soft agar and form tumors in nude mice. The soft agar assay was performed as follows. A layer of bottom agar (8% noble agar) was placed onto 60 mm2 tissue culture dishes. The tumor cells were trypsinized from normal growth flasks while in exponential growth. The cells were counted by using a hemacytometer and 1.0 x 105 cells were placed into the top agar mixture containing growth medium, 4% noble agar and various concentrations of drugs. The concentration range was normally between 10 uM to 75 uM. The cells were not refed during the assay system; therefore, the cells were treated with one dose of the agents. The plates were stained 20 days later with a 0.05% (w/v) nitroblue tetrazolium solution (which stains only viable cells) for 48 hours. The results are shown in Fig. 1, the y-axis being the percent of cell colonies remaining in comparison to untreated control cells.  Even at the highest<br>
concentration tested, celecoxib obtained only about partial inhibition, compared -to 100% for the compounds of the invention:<br>
