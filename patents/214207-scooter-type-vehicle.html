COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SCOOTER TYPE VEHICLE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a scooter type vehicle and more particularly to a scooter type vehicle which is improved in the passenger riding comfortableness. [Prior Art]<br>
In Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-7056 there is disclosed a scooter type vehicle wherein a rear cowl is provided below a twin seat, the rear cowl being narrow around passenger steps.<br>
In Japanese Patent Publication No Hei 7-90815 there is disclosed a two-wheeled motor vehicle in which plate-like pillion steps permitting a rider to put whole of his or her feet thereon are respectively fixed nearly horizontally to side portions of a vehicle body at<br><br><br>
positions below a front seat.  In comparison with bar-like steps the plate-like steps are advantageous in that a passenger is easy to put his or her feet thereon and that<br>
a high degree of freedom in putting the passenger s feet thereon can be obtained.  There also is known a pillion step structure wherein a pillion step can be folded pivotally about a pivot shaft extending in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle body. [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
There sometimes is a case where a container box or a fuel tank is to be accommodated in a space below a seat or a case where a tail light unit having a large width in the vehicular transverse direction is to be mounted or a case where the width in the vehicular transverse direction of a body cover below a seat is to be made as large as possible.  In such cases, however, it is necessary that the portion overlapping the passenger"s thighs or knees be made wide, thus requiring the passenger to take an unnatural posture.  For this reason it is difficult to widen the portion in question.  Even if the portions around the passenger steps are made narrow as in the foregoing conventional example, it is impossible to solve the above problem encountered in widening the rear cowl.<br><br>
3<br><br>
The pillion steps are made pivotable so that they can be stowed when there is no passenger.  When the pillion steps are to be stowed, it is desired for the pillion steps to be pivotable even while the rider is sitting on the front seat.  However, even if the pillion steps are pivotable, if their pivot shafts are horizontal as in the above prior art, it is difficult to stow the pillion steps while the rider is sitting on the front seat.  On the passenger side, if the pillion steps are plate-like and their surfaces are horizontal, it is difficult for the passenger to stretch the legs. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to solve such problems.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
For solving the above-mentioned problem, according to the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a scooter type vehicle wherein a body cover is provided below a twin seat and sideways projecting portions in the transverse direction of the vehicle are provided on the body cover in the vicinity of a lower portion of the seat, characterized in that at a position where each of the sideways projecting portions overlaps a leg of a pillion passenger in side view, each sideways projecting portion is formed as a surface shape changing<br><br><br>
portion wherein the quantity of the sideways projection is partially small.<br>
In this connection, the aforesaid surface changing portion may be formed as a flat portion or as a curved concave or convex surface.<br>
According to the second aspect of the present invention there is provided a scooter type vehicle wherein a body cover is provided below a twin seat and sideways projecting portions projecting in the transverse direction of the vehicle are provided on the body cover in the vicinity of a lower portion of the seat, characterized in that the body cover has a portion extending above a rear wheel, the extending portion above the rear wheel being provided with a slant surface whose vertical width becomes narrower gradually on a lower side with respect to a maximum sideways projecting portion, and a seat opening/closing lock is mounted so as to face a key hole obliquely downward which key hole is formed in the slant surface.<br>
For solving the above-mentioned problems, according to the present invention there is provided a pillion step structure including a plate-like pillion step provided on each side portion of a vehicle body so as to be pivotable between a stowed state and a use state, characterized in<br><br><br>
that a pivot shaft of the pillion step is inclined forwardly upward with respect to a horizontal plane.<br>
A step floor may be extended up to a position where the step floor is opposed to the pillion step.  In this case, the pivot shaft may be provided in a boss portion extending from a body frame, and an opening through which the boss portion projects outwards may be formed in the step floor.  The said opening may be opened backwards of the vehicle body.  Further, the shape of the extending portion of the step floor opposed to the pillion step may be made almost equal to the shape of the pillion step as stowed.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the first aspect of the present invention, even if the body cover is widened by forming sideways projecting portions below the seat, since the portion overlapping the passenger"s leg in side view in each sideways projecting portion is formed as a surface shape changing portion which is narrow in the vehicular transverse direction, the passenger can sit on the pillion comfortably without assuming any unnatural sitting posture by lapping his or her leg on the surface shape changing portion in side view.  Thus, while ensuring the comfortableness of the passenger, it is possible to<br><br><br>
install a container box and a fuel tank both large in capacity, as well as a large-sized tail light unit with the body cover portion located below the seat is made wide .<br>
Moreover, if the surface shape changing portion is made a flat surface, the flat surface can escape from a leg portion of the passenger and can be molded easily.  It is also possible to form the surface shape changing portion as a curved concave or convex surface, thus increasing the freedom of design.<br>
According to the second aspect of the present invention, in the body cover portion extending above the rear wheel, even if the portion lower than the maximum sideways projecting portion is a slant face whose vertical width becomes narrower backward gradually, since a seat opening/closing lock is mounted so as to face a key hole obliquely downward which key hole is formed in the said slant face, the seat opening/closing lock can be provided in the body cover portion located above the rear wheel even if the body cover portion located below the seat is made wide.  Besides, it is possible to prevent the entry of rainwater into the seat opening/closing lock.<br>
In the pillion step structure of the present invention, the pillion steps are formed as plate-like<br><br><br>
steps capable of being stowed to enhance the degree of freedom in putting the passenger"s feet thereon.  Besides, the steps are pivotable with respect to an axis which is inclined forwardly upward.  Therefore, when the pillion steps are to be stowed in the absence of a passenger, all that is required for the rider is merely pushing up the pillion steps from the front side by his or her feet while sitting on the front seat.  Thus, the operability is improved.<br>
Besides, the pivot shaft of each pillion step is inclined forwardly upward, so when the passenger stretches the legs at the time of deceleration for example, the foot bearing surface of each pillion step can be set at nearly right angles to the foot, thus making it easy for the passenger to stretch the legs.<br>
Moreover, since the step floor is extended up to a position where the step floor is opposed to each pillion step, the pillion step stowed state can provide an appearance having an integral feeling with the step floor and thus the appearance is improved.  Besides, if the portion of the step floor opposed to the pillion step when stowed is male almost equal in shape to the pillion step, the integral feeling in the stowed state of the pillion step is further enhanced and thus it is possible<br><br><br>
to further improve the appearance.<br>
Further, an opening through which a boss portion for mounting the pillion step projects is formed in a rear end portion of the step floor and is opened backward of the vehicle body, so when the step floor is to be mounted to the vehicle body, it is possible to effect the mounting easily while allowing only the boss portion to project outwards and allowing the other frame portions to be covered inside.  Therefore, both working efficiency and appearance are improved.<br><br><br><br><br>

As shown in Fig. 1, this two-wheeled motor vehicle is a scooter type vehicle which adopts a front wheel 1 and a rear wheel 2, both wheels being large in diameter.  An upper portion of a front fork 3 is covered with a front cover 4 and a leg shield 5 from front and behind.  An air inlet 6 for introducing air for cooling a radiator is formed centrally of a front side of the front cover 4 and a pair of winkers 7 are provided on the right and left sides, respectively, of the air inlet 6.  Further, air discharge ports 8 for discharging warm air after cooling the radiator to the exterior are formed on both right and left sides of the leg shield 5.<br>
The front cover 4 is composed of a body portion 4a positioned above the front wheel 1 and a front side cover 4b, the front side cover 4b being connected to a lower portion of the body portion 4a and extending obliquely<br>
13<br><br>
downward and backward behind the front wheel 1.  Above the front cover 4 and the leg shield 5 is provided a handlebar cover 10 which covers a handlebar 9, and a headlight 11 is mounted in a front side of the handlebar cover 10.  Further, a meter panel 10a is provided on a rear side of an upper surface of the handlebar cover 10 (Fig. 2).<br>
A lower portion of the leg shield 5 is connected to a floor panel 12 which covers a step floor of a low type. The floor panel 12 is bent nearly horizontally at a somewhat lower position from the connection with the leg shield 5 and extends backward, providing a step floor surface for putting thereon of rider"s feet.  A rear portion of the floor panel 12 is connected to a rear cover 13 which rises upward from the floor surface.<br>
The rear cover 13 is a vertically open member which covers the space between a seat 14 and front and upper portions of the rear wheel 2 .  The upper opening of the rear cover 13 is covered with the seat 14 so that it can be opened and closed.  The seat 14 is a twin seat and is provided with a front seat 14a for a rider and a rear seat 14b for a passenger.  A combined grab rail and carrier 33a extends backward from both right and left sides of the rear seat 14b.  Front end portions of the<br>
14<br><br>
combined grab rail and carrier 33a are supported by seat rail portions of a body frame, which will be described later, through stays 33b, the stays 33b extending through the rear cover 13 from the inside to the outside.<br>
A front portion 13a of the rear cover is the largest in vertical width from the floor surface up to the front seat 14a, and a maintenance lid 15 is attached to a lower portion of the front portion 13a so as to cover a maintenance hole removably, the maintenance hole being formed so as to extend curvilinearly from the front side to both right and left sides.<br>
Step floor side faces located lower than the floor panel 12 are covered with lower covers 16, and front end portions thereof are connected to rear end portions of the front cover 4, while upper portions thereof are connected to the floor panel 12 .  For convenience sake, the front cover 4, the leg shield 5, and the handlebar cover 10 are generically designated a front body cover, the floor panel 12 and the lower covers 16 are generically designated a floor cover, and the rear cover 13 is designated a rear body cover.  Further, all of these covers are generically designated a body cover.  These body cover portions are appearance members and are each formed of a suitable material such as a plastic material.<br><br><br>
The maintenance lid 15 is formed of a suitable material such as a plastic material and is generally L-shaped in side view.  Mounting and removal of the maintenance lid 15 result in closing and opening of a maintenance hole formed on the front portion 13a side of the rear cover and at the same time result in closing and opening of a maintenance hole (not shown) provided on the floor side which maintenance hole is formed in the floor panel 12 formed with a generally horizontal bottom portion.  Right and left rear end portions of the floor panel 12 extend backward sideways of the front portion 13a of the rear cover, forming extension ends 12a which extend obliquely upward.  Pillion steps 17 for a passenger are adapted to lap on the extension ends 12a when stowed.<br>
Flat surfaces 18 are formed on side faces of the rear cover 13 and at positions below the front seat 14a and above the pillion steps 17, and a large-sized tail light unit 19 is attached to a rear end portion of the rear cover 13 so as to extend curvilinearly up to side faces of the rear cover.  A seat locking key hole 20 is formed in a side face of the rear cover 13 at a position near the tail light unit 19 and above the rear wheel 2. In the figures, the reference numeral 21 denotes a swing type power unit, numeral 2 2 denotes an air cleaner,<br><br><br>
numeral 23 denotes a rear cushion, and numeral 24 denotes a main stand.<br>
The swing type power unit 21 is provided with a four-cycle engine to be described later and a V belt type transmission.  The numeral 21a in the figures denotes a crank shaft, on which is mounted a driving pulley coaxially.  Numeral 21b denotes a transmission output shaft, on which are mounted a driven pulley and a starting clutch coaxially.  Numeral 21c denotes a V belt entrained on both driving pulley and driven pulley and extending therebetween, and numeral 21d denotes an axle of the rear wheel.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a head pipe 26 is provided at a front end portion of a body frame 25 and a steering shaft 27 is supported rotatably by the head pipe 26.  The front fork 3 and the handlebar 9 are connected with each other through the steering shaft 27.  Further, as shown in Fig. 4, the swing type power unit 21 is supported at a central part of the body frame 25 swingably through a link mechanism 28.<br>
As shown also in Figs. 8 and 9, the body frame 25 comprises a down portion 3 0 extending obliquely downward and backward centrally of the vehicle body from the head pipe 26, a pair of right and left floor portions 31 whose<br><br><br>
front ends are welded to both sides of a lower portion of the down portion 30, the floor portions 31 extending obliquely downward and backward, then being bent nearly horizontally and further extending backward, pillar portions 32 which are bent from rear ends of the floor portions 31 and which extend upward in front of the rear wheel 2, and seat rail portions 3 3 whose upper ends are welded to the pillar portions 32 and which extend obliquely upward and backward below the seat 14 and above the rear wheel 2.<br>
The down portion 30 is a single pipe member.  The floor portions 31 and the pillar portions 32 are contiguous pipe members, which are each provided in a pair right and left.  The seat rail portions 33, which are provided in a pair right and left, are connected with each other through an overhanging portion 3 4 which extends forward of the vehicle body from upper ends of the pillar portions 32 so as to be bent convexly to the front side.  That is, the seat rail portions 33 are formed as portions of a single pipe member which is generally U-shaped in plan.  The right and left seat rail portions 33 are connected together on their rear sides by means of a cross member 35.  Pivot plates 36 are provided respectively in the connections between the seat rails 33<br>
18<br><br>
and the pillar portions 32 and pivot portions 36a are provided on the pivot plates 36 respectively. With the pivot portions 36a, one end side of the link mechanism 28 is journaled, which link mechanism, on the other side thereof, supports the swing type power unit 21.<br>
The rear ends of the right and left floor portions 31 are curved in a backwardly convex shape and are then connected together through a rear cross pipe 38.  Both sides of the cross pipe 38 are welded to rear end undersides of the right and left floor portions 31. Further, side stays 3 9 extend outside and sideways of the right and left floor portions 31 longitudinally and nearly in parallel with the floor portions.  The side stays 39 are connected to the corresponding floor portions 31 each through stays 40a and 40b.  Front ends of step frames 41 are clamped respectively to the stays 4 0b which are located on the rear side.<br>
The step frames 41 are pipe members which are curved obliquely backward and upwardly convexly along lower portions of the right and left pillar portion 32 respectively.  The opposite end sides of the step frames 41 are attached from behind to brackets 32a (Figs, 7 and 10) which are secured to rear sides of the pillar portions 32.  At uppermost tops of the step frames 41 are<br><br><br>
provided mounting bosses 42 for the pillion steps.<br>
The front ends of the right and left floor portions 31 are also interconnected with a front cross pipe 37, and a lower end of the down portion 30 is welded to an intermediate position of the front cross  pipe 37.  In this way there is formed an underfloor space which is surrounded by the right and left floor portions 31 and front and rear cross pipes 37, 38.<br>
Again with reference to Figs. 3 to 6, a description will now be given about a layout relation between the body frame 25 and various components.

The floor tray 47 is formed of a suitable material such as a plastic material and is supported at peripheral portions of the recess 48 by the right and left floor portions 31 and the front and rear cross pipes 37, 38. Further, an opening formed above the recess 48 faces a maintenance hole formed in the floor panel 12 and is opened and closed by the bottom of the maintenance lid 15.<br>
The step frames 42 are covered with the extension ends 12a of the floor panel 12, and the bosses   42 and the pillion steps 17 extend to the exterior through apertures formed in the extension ends 12a (Fig. 2).<br>
The swing type power unit 21 supported by the pivot plates 36 is provided at a front portion thereof with a water-cooled four-cycle engine.  As is seen in Fig. 7, the engine is provided with a cylinder 50, a cylinder head 51, and a cylinder head cover 52 and is disposed nearly horizontally.  The cylinder head cover 52, the cylinder head 51, a spark plug 53 attached to a side face of the cylinder head 51, and a part of a carburetor 54 connected to an intake port of the cylinder head 51, face the<br><br><br>
opening of a maintenance hole which is covered with the maintenance lid 15.<br>
The air cleaner 22 introduces the outside air through a duct 22a projecting forward from a front portion of the air cleaner and supplies clean air to the carburetor 54 through a connecting tube 22b.  An exhaust pipe 5 5, which is connected at one end thereof to an exhaust port of the cylinder head 51, passes below the engine and is connected at the opposite end thereof to a muffler 56 mounted-sideways of the rear wheel (Fig. 4). Further, as shown in Fig. 2, the engine side and the radiator 43 are connected with each other through water feed pipes 57a and 57b which are offset to the right-hand side of the vehicle body, allowing cooling water to circulate.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the overhanging portion 34 projects forward to about the same extent as the cylinder head cover 52 and a goods container 58 is carried on both overhanging portion 34 and front halves of the seat rail portions 33.  Behind the goods container 58 a fuel tank 59 is supported on latter halves of the seat rail portions 33.  Further, upper ends of the rear cushions 23 are secured to the seat rail portions 33 at positions close to a longitudinally intermediate portion of the fuel tank<br>

The following description is now provided about the structure of the radiator and the vicinity thereof.  Fig. 11 is a perspective view of the rear cover 13, Fig. 12 is a sectional view taken on line 12-12 in Fig. 11, and Fig. 13 is a sectional view taken on line 13-13 in Fig. 11. The rear cover 13 is formed so as to cover the vehicle body at the portion below the seat and front and upper portions of the rear wheel 2.  In a lower position of a front portion 13a of the rear cover 13, an opening 60 for maintenance hole is formed from the front side to both right and left sides, to which opening 6 0 is attached the maintenance lid 15.<br>
On each of both right and left side faces of the rear cover 13, a relatively upper portion close to an upper end projects most outwards as an edge line 61.  The portion above the edge line 61 provides an upper front surface 62 which projects outwardly sideways to a greater extent toward the edge line 61 from the upper end, while the portion below the edge line 61 provides a lower slant surface 6 3 which is inclined to a greater extent toward a lower end and toward a generally central side in the vehicular transverse direction.  The edge line 61 corresponds to the maximum sideways projecting portion as<br><br><br>
referred to herein and the portions of the upper and lower slant surfaces 62, 63 located in the vicinity of the edge line 61, including the edge line, constitute the sideways projecting portion.<br>
The edge lines 61 on both right and left sides constitute wide portions of the reaz cover 13 in the vehicular transverse direction.  In each of the said wide portions, a partial flat portion 18 (see Fig. 1) is formed at a position below the latter half side of the front seat 14a of the seat 14 and in   front of the rear seat 14b, on which position there laps a leg portion F such as a thigh or knee of a passenger P in side view. The flat portion 18 is a narrow portion in the vehicular transverse direction partially retracted inwards of the vehicle body with respect to the surrounding wide portion. The flat portion 18 is one concrete example of the surface shape changing portion as referred to herein.<br>
As is seen in Fig. 12, the fiat portion 18 is in a retracted shape inwards of the vehicle body with respect to the edge line 61 projecting most outwards, in which shape the upper and lower portions thereof including the edge line 61 are cut out.  The flat portion 18 becomes so much narrower in the vehicular transverse direction and forms a recess relatively with respect to the surrounding<br><br><br>
wide portion.<br>
The flat portion 18 is in a positional relation to each leg portion F of the passenger sitting on the rear seat 14b such that the leg portion F laps sideways on the flat portion 18 in side view.  The flat portion 18 is a plane shape, but is somewhat inclined outwards on its lower side.  It is important that this portion be a recess to provide a partial narrow-width portion.  Its surface shape is not limited to a plane shape, but may be a curved concave surface which sinks inwards of the vehicle body or may conversely be a curved convex surface.<br>
Although in the illustrated section a lower portion 63a of the lower slant surface 63 is partially large in width, it is positioned more inwards of the vehicle body than the edge line 61 which is defined by both an upper portion of the lower slant surface 63 which portion overlies the lower portion 6 3a and the upper slant surface62.  The thus wide lower portion 63a is only a partial portion with respect to the whole of the lower slant surface 63.<br>
The portion of the rear cover 13 located behind the flat portion 18 and extending above the rear wheel 2 is narrower in vertical with toward the rear side.  Besides, the ridge line 61 approaches the seat.  In side view,<br><br><br>
therefore, the lower slant surface 63 as an overhanging slant surface which underlies the ridge line 61 occupies the greater part of the rear cover, and the vertical width of the lower slant surface 63 itself also decreases its vertical width gradually.  A cutout portion 64, which is open backward, is formed in a rear end portion of the rear cover 13 and cut-in portions 65 are formed on both sides of the cutout portion 64 so as to extend curvilinearly to both right and left side faces of the rear cover.  The tail lamp unit 19 (see Fig. 1), which is relatively wide and large-sized, is fitted in the cutout portion 64 and the cut-in portions 65.<br>
A key hole 20 is formed in one side face of the rear portion of the rear cover 13 at a position approximately just above the central part of the rear wheel 2 and close to a cut-in portion 65.  As is seen in Fig. 13, the key hole 20 is open so as to face obliquely downward in a lower end portion of the lower slant surface 63.  Inside the key hole 20 is provided a key cylinder 66 for locking the seat.  When a key 67 is inserted into the key cylinder 66   for unlocking, a seat lock (not shown) provided on a rear end side of the seat is unlocked and the seat 14 can be opened pivotally about a hinge {not shown) provided on a front end side of the<br><br><br>
seat.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described.  As shown in Figs. 1, 11, and 12, since the flat portion 18 is formed as a narrow-width portion on each side face of the rear cover 13 and at a position below the front seat 14a and in front of the rear seat 14b, the passenger P, when placing his or her leg portions F across the upper surface of the flat portion 18 in side view, can sit on the rear seat 14b without widening the leg portion F to an unnaturally large extent. Thus, the passenger can sit on the pillion comfortably without taking any unnatural posture.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to form the rear cover 13 widely without affecting the comfortableness of the passenger and hence possible to install the wide and large-sized tail lamp unit 19. Also, the container box 58 and the fuel tank 59 both large in capacity can be accommodated inside the rear cover 13.<br>
Moreover, since the flat portion 18 has a plane surface and is somewhat inclined on its lower side so as to expand outwards, an acute contact feeling is not given to the leg portion F and the flat portion 18 can escape from the leg portion over a wide range.  Besides, molding of the flat portion 18 is easy.  Further, the surface of<br>
27<br><br>
the flat portion 18 can be formed as a curved concave or convex surface other than the flat surface, whereby the design freedom is enhanced.<br>
Additionally, the key hole 20 is opened obliquely downward and the key cylinder 66 is allowed to face the key hole obliquely downward.  Therefore, even if the rear cover 13 is made wide and consequently, even if each of the side faces located above the rear wheel 2 is gradually narrower in vertical width toward the rear side and the greater part thereof becomes the lower slant surface 63 which is an overhanging slant surface, the key cylinder 66 can be disposed in this portion and at an optimal position close to the seat lock.  Besides, the entry of rainwater into the key cylinder 6 6 can be prevented because the key cylinder is disposed so as to face obliquely downward.<br>
The following description is now provided about the pillion steps.  Fig. 14 is a perspective view showing a mounting portion of each pillion step 17 which is in a stowed state and Fig. 15 is a schematic plan view showing each pillion step 17 which is in use. As is seen in Fig. 14, each pillion step 17 is supported pivotably by pivot shafts 70 with respect to the boss 42 formed at the top of the step frame 41.  The pillion step 17 is pivotable<br><br><br>
between a use position in which it is brought down outwardly sideways and nearly horizontally and a stowed position in which it stands up.  The pivot shafts 70 each have a forwardly upward slant axis so that the pillion step 17 can be stowed easily when pushed backward with a foot of the rider in a sitting posture on the front seat 14a.<br>
The pillion step 17 when stowed confronts the rear extension end 12a of the step floor 12.  The rear extension end 12a is in a retracted position inwards of the vehicle body through a stepped portion so that the pillion step 17 laps thereon when stowed.  And it is formed in almost the same shape (a generally triangular shape) as the pillion step 17.<br>
The rear extension end 12a is formed by specially extending the rear portion of the step floor 12 up to the position (Fig. 3) where it overlaps a side portion of the swing unit 20 so as to stow the pillion step 17.  An opening 72 for projection therethrough of the boss 42 is formed in a stepped portion 71 and is opened backward of the vehicle body (see Fig. 2).  Below the opening 72 is formed a lower extension 73 which projects outwardly sideways to a higher extent than the rear extension end 12a to cover the top side of the step frame 41.<br>
29<br><br>
Fig. 15 shows the shape of the pillion step 17 as seen in plan while it is in use.  A longitudinal width W of the pillion step 17 is smaller than the length of the passenger"s foot F, permitting only the central portion of the foot to be put on the pillion step.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described.  The pillion step 17 is plate-like, but can be stowed and is pivotable about the pivot shafts 70 whose axes are inclined forwardly upwards.  When the pillion step is to be stowed in the absence of a passenger, it can be stowed easily by being pushed obliquely upward and backward with a foot of the rider in a sitting posture on the front seat 14a.  Thus, the operability of the pillion step is improved.<br>
Moreover, the pivot shaft 70 is inclined forwardly upward, so when force is applied to the foot F at the time of deceleration for example, the bearing surface of the pillion step 17 for the passenger"s foot can be set at approximately right angles to the foot, thus making it easier for the passenger to stretch the legs.  Besides, since the longitudinal width W of the pillion step 17 is made smaller than the length of the passenger"s foot F, thereby permitting only the central portion of the foot to be put on the pillion step, it is possible to freely<br><br><br>
adjust the angle of contact of the foot with the pillion step 17.<br>
Further, since a part of the floor panel 12 is extended up to the position where it confronts the pillion step 17 as stowed, forming the rear extension end 12a of the floor panel, the pillion step 17 as stowed can afford an appearance having an integral impression with the rear extension end 12a of the floor panel.  Thus, the appearance can be improved.  Besides, if the portion of the rear extension end 12a of the floor, panel which comes into opposition-to the-pi11ion step 17 when stowed is made almost equal in shape to the pillion step, it is possible to further enhance the integral impression in a stowed state of the pillion step and improve the appearance to a further extent.<br>
Further, the opening 72 through which the boss portion 42 for mounting the pillion step 17 projects is formed in the rear end portion of the floor panel 12 and it is opened backward of the vehicle body, so at the time of mounting the floor panel 12 to the vehicle body, the mounting operation can be done easily while allowing only the boss portion 42 to be projected outwards and while allowing the other portions such as the step frame 41 to be covered inside.  Thus, both working efficiency and appearance can be improved.<br>
