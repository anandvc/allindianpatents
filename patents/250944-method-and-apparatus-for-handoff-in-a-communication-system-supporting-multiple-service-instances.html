				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDOFF IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM SUPPORTING MULTIPLE SERVICE<br>
INSTANCES<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[1001] The present invention relates to wireless communication systems generally and specifically, to methods and apparatus for handoff for a packet data service<br>
Background<br>
[1002] There is an increasing demand for packetized data services over wireless communication systems. As traditional wireless communication systems are designed for voice Communications, the extension to support data services introduces many challenges. Specifically, the problems exist during handoff involving a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) communication of data packets. As systems upgrade components, compatibility issues between components may hinder operation of the system. Further, there is a desire to remove handoff responsibility from the mobile station and provide smart handoff by the infrastructure elements.<br>
[1003] There Is a need, therefore, for fast, accurate handoff between Packet Data Service Nodes (PDSNs) and other Infrastructure elements in a wireless communication system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1014] The word "exemplary" is used exclusively herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. While the various aspects of the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale uniess specifically indicated.<br>
[1015] The following discussion develops the exemplary embodiments by first presenting a network implementing mobile IP to communicate data to and from a<br><br>
WO 03/079716	PCT/US03/07399<br>
3<br>
mobile node. Then a spread-spectrum wireless communication system is discussed. Next, the mobile IP network is shown implemented in the wireless communication system. The messages are illustrated that register a mobile node with a home agent thereby enabling IP data to be sent to and from the mobile node. Finally, methods for reclaiming resources at the home agent are explained. [1016] Note that the exemplary embodiment is provided as an exemplar throughout this discussion; however, alternate embodiments may incorporate various aspects without departing from the scope of the present invention. Specifically, the various embodiments are appiicable to a data processing system, a wireless communication system, a mobile IP network and any other system desiring efficiÃ«nt use and management of resources.<br>
[1017] The exemplary embodiment employs a spread-spectrum wireless communication system. Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication such as voice, data, and so on. These systems may be based on Code Division-Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), or some other modulation techniques. A CDMA system provides certain advantages over other types of systems, including increased system capacity.<br>
[1018] A system may be designed to support one or more standards such as the "TIA/EIA/IS-95-B Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wldeband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" referred to herein as the iS-95 Standard, the Standard offered by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" referred to herein as 3GPP, and embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214, 3G TS 25.302, referred to herein as the W-CDMA Standard, the Standard offered by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" referred to herein as 3GPP2, and TR-45.5 referred to herein as the cdma2000 Standard, formerly called IS-2000 MC. The standards cited hereinabove are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. [1019] Each Standard specifically defines the processing of data for transmission from base station to mobile, and vice versa. As an exemplary embodiment the following discussion considers a spread-spectrum communication<br><br>
WO 03/079716	PCT/US03/07399<br>
4<br>
system consistent with the CDMA2000 Standard of protocols. Altemate embodiments may incorporate another Standard.<br>
[1020] A communication system 100 according to one embodiment is siiown in<br>
FIG. 10. The communication system 100 includes both wireless portions and<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) portions. The terminology used to describe the various<br>
elements of the system 200 is intended to facilitate understanding of the handoff<br>
processes described herein. A Mobile Station 120 operating within communication<br>
system 100 is first in communication with a Source-Radio Network (S-RN) 108,<br>
wherein the term source refers to the RN as being the original serving networi^.<br>
The MS 120 has established a Sen/ice Instance (SI) with S-RN. A service<br>
instance refers to a link associated with a service option. For example, a sen/ice<br>
option may be a packet data link, a Voice over IP (VoiP) link, etc. The S-RN has<br>
established an A-10 connection with the Source-PDSN (S-PDSN) 104 via an IP<br>
Network 106. The A-10 connection is associated with the SI. Note that the<br>
various elements of the system, such as the S-PDSN 104, the S-RN 108, and the<br>
MS 120, may support only one SI, or may support multiple SI. Also, within a given<br>
system, such as system 100, various elements may support only a single SI while<br>
other elements support multiple SI. The later system configurations may lead to<br>
incompatibilities in the capabilities of the various elements, and thus effect<br>
handoff. The S-PDSN 102 is also in communication with an IP Network 130.<br>
Operation of system 100 may be as specified In the cdma2000 Wireless IP<br>
Network Standard.	"	..<br>
[1021] The MS 120 Is mobile and may move into an area supported by a Target-RN (T-RN) 118. As the MS 120 is able to communicate with T-RN 118, handoff may proceed from S-RN 108 to T-RN 118. Once handoff of the wireless portion of the communication system 100 is completed, the packet data portion of the system 100 must set up the various PPP links, such as an A-10 connection from T-PDSN 114 to T-RN through IP Network 116. As discussed hereinabove, various scenarios are possible for the configuration and handoff processing of a system, such as system 100.<br>
[1022] In a first scenario, illustrated in FIG. 1 and with reference to FIG. 11, the S-PDSN 104 and the T-PDSN 114 have a same capability with respect to handling Sen/ice Instances (SI).    As illustrated in FIG. 11, multiple SI links may be<br><br>
WO 03/079716	PCT/US03/07399<br>
5<br>
established to both S-PDSN 104 and T-PDSN 114. For multiple SI links, one link is designated as a maln link, or PPP link. The main link is used for setting up the PPP link and is also used for signaling associated with the multiple links. The main link is the link on which the primary packet service instance is connected. It is the service instance that is first negotiated when establishing the packet service. This means that the initial PPP negotiation takes place over this service instance. The primary packet service instance has a direct relation to the packet data session itself. This means that whenever there is a packet data session, there's a primary packet service instance connected to it. The main link is identified as "MAIN SI." Additional links are referred to as auxiliary or secondary links, identified as "AUX SI." Each link is further defined by an A-10 connection to a PDSN. [1023] In the call flow scenario of FIG. 1, the infrastructure elements, S-PDSN 104 and T-PDSN 114 successfully handoff the communication with MS 120. The handoff is effected without passing responsibility on to MS 120. In other words, MS 120 is not required to iniliate a new communication at the target netwerk, such as may have been required if handoff were not successful and the target netwerk would tear down the main SI and auxiliary SI. As in FIG. 1, S-PDSN 104 provides T-PDSN 114 with the necessary Information to establish communication with MS 120. Note that even though handoff is completed within the radio netwerk or wireless portion of the system, the packet data portion or IP portion requires additional infomiation to set up the various connections required. For example, the T-PDSN 114 needs to know which SI is the main SI, as the T-PDSN 114 needs to negotiate PPP set up on the main SI.<br>
[1024] FIG. 1 illustrates a call flow associated with fast handoff of one embodiment. FIG. 1 illustrates a successful case when the handoff happens between the same revisions of two PDSNs, e.g. both PDSN are implementing IS-835-B procedures. In this case, there are PDSN to PDSN (P-P) connections established successfully between the Target-PDSN (T-PDSN) and the Serving-PDSN (S-PDSN). In the situation that P-P connections can not be established correctly, the normal hard handoff should occur without tearing the traffic channel. However, if multiple service instances exist (for example, voice over IP), the target PDSN does not know the PPP service instance (main service instance), therefore,<br><br>
WO0J/0797I6	<br>
it can not initiate PPP negotiation on the correct R-P connection.   Each labeled step of call flow of FIG. 1 is detailed as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the Source-<br>
Packet Data Service Node (S-PDSN) via the Source-Radio Network (S-<br>
RN). The mobile station may have multiple service instances allocated<br>
in the S-RN.<br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends<br>
pilot reports to the S-RN. At this time, the mobile still has airlink traffic<br>
channels to the S-RN and an Internet Protocol (IP) session established<br>
to the S-PDSN.<br>
C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to Target-Radio Network (T-RN)<br>
via Mobile Switching Center (MSC) (not shown).<br>
D.	The T-RN sends an Al 1 Registration Request (RRQ) to the Target-<br>
Packet Data Sen/ice Node (T-PDSN) including the s bit set to 1 and the<br>
sen/ing P-P address attribute set to the Pi IP address of the S-PDSN.<br>
P-P refers to the connection between the S-PDSN and the T-PDSN. Pi<br>
refers to the PDSN to IP connection. The s bit indicates simultaneous<br>
binding.<br>
E.	The T-PDSN sends a P-P RRQ including the s bit set to 1 to the S-<br>
PDSN's Pi IP address. The setting of the s bit indicates a request for a<br>
simultaneous binding at the S-PDSN.<br>
F.	The S-PDSN replies with a P-P Registration Reply (RRP) w'rth the reply<br>
code set to 0. The reply code indicates indicates whether the operation<br>
is successful (or failure). The reply code O corresponds to a successful<br>
operation, wherein the reply code other than O gives a different failure<br>
reason.<br>
G.	The T-PDSN sends an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-<br>
RN.<br>
H. At this point, forward direction bearer traffic arriving at the S-PDSN is bicast to the S-RN and the T-PDSN. The T-RN may buffer the last N packets, where N is implementation dependent. Reverse direction bearer traffic traverses only the S-RN and the S-PDSN.<br><br><br>
I.   The S-RN hands off the mobile's Service Instance(s) (Sis) to the T-RN by sending a handoff direction command to the mobile station.<br>
J. The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends a handoff completion Indication to the T-RN.<br>
K. Upon completion of the handoff of the Sen/ice Instances (Sis), the T-RN sends an A11 RRQ with the s bit set to O and including an active start airlink record to the T-PDSN.<br>
L. The T-PDSN sends a P-P RRQ with the s bit set to O and including an active start airlink record to the S-PDSN. The active start airlink record sent is the same one that was received from the T-RN.<br>
M. The S-PDSN replies with a P-P RRP with the reply code set to 0.<br>
N. The T-PDSN send an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
O. At this point, forward direction bearer traffic is tunneled from the S-PDSN to the T-PDSN over the P-P interface, then switched onto the appropriate A10 session and delivered to the T-RN. Reverse direction bearer traffic is sent from the mobile to the T-RN, then over the appropriate A10 session to the T-PDSN. The T-PDSN tunnels this traffic over the P-P interface to the S-PDSN. Note that the P-P session may be periodically refreshed by the T-PDSN sending a P-P RRQ to the S-PDSN.<br>
P. The S-PDSN initiates a teardown of the mobile's A10/A11 session(s) to the S-RN by sending an A11 RUP to the S-RN.<br>
Q. The S-RN responde with an Al 1 RAK.<br>
R. The S-RN indicates that the session will be terminated by sending an A11 RRQ to the S-PDSN with the lifetime set to O, including an active stop accounting record. Note that the accounting record will send to Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) unit from Serving PDSN. AAA is not shown.<br>
S. The S-PDSN indicates that the session is released by sending an Al 1 RRP to the S-RN with the lifetime set to 0. Note that the S-PDSN does not delete the associated PPP context because it is being used by the mobile via the P-P interface.<br><br><br>
[1025] In a second scenario, illustrated in FIG. 2, again S-PDSN and T-PDSN share same capabilities, however, tiiey fail to negotiate the handoff of the multiple SI links. The S-PDSN is able to send a message indicating which of the links is the main link. The T-PDSN then takes responsibility for the handoff and sets up connections for the MS.<br>
[1026] Note that the sen/ing PDSN desires to send PPP sen/ice instance indication to the target PDSN in P-P RRP during the period of the signaling exchange to setup P-P connections. This Information may be sent regardless of whether P-P connections are setup successfully or unsuccessfully. In the case that the P-P connections establishment fails or later some disconnection between T-PDSN and S-PDSN is detected, the target PDSN uses this Information to trigger the PPP negotiation on the correct R-P connection. FIG. 2 illustrates this type of call flow. Each labeled step of call flow of FIG. 1 is detailed as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the S-PDSN<br>
via the S-RN. The mobile may have multiple service instances allocated in<br>
the S-RN.<br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends pilot<br>
reports to the S-RN. Note that the mobile still has airlink traffic channels to<br>
the S-RN and an IP session established to the S-PDSN.<br>
C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown).<br>
D.	The T-RN sends an Al 1 RRQ to the T-PDSN Including the s bit set to 1 and<br>
the serving P-P address attribute set to the Pi IP address of the S-PDSN.<br>
E.	The T-PDSN sends a P-P RRQ including the s bit set to 1 to the S-PDSN's<br>
Pi IP address. The setting of the s bit indicates a request for a<br>
simultaneous binding at the S-PDSN.<br>
F.	The S-PDSN replies with a P-P RRP with a reply code other than O,<br>
indicating that the P-P session cannot be established and indicating the<br>
PPP service instance.<br>
G.	The T-PDSN send an Al 1 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
H. The S-RN hands off the mobile's service instance(s) to the T-RN by<br>
sending handoff direction command to the mobile station. I.   The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion indication to the T-RN.<br><br>
J.  Upon completion of the handoff of the service instances, the T-RN sends an Al 1 RRQ with the s bit set to O and including an active start airlink record to the T-PDSN. K. The T-PDSN send an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN. L. The T-PDSN initiates PPP negotiation with the mobile by sending it an<br>
LCP-configure-request, M. PPP negotiation is complete. For simple IP sessions, bearer traffic may now flow in both directions over the T-RN and T-PDSN. For MIP sessions, the behavior is as follows below. N. The T-PDSN sends a Mobile IP (MIP) agent advertisement to the mobile. Note that the mobile may first send a MIP agent solicitation to the T-PDSN (not shown). O. The mobile sends a MIP RRQ tothe T-PDSN.<br>
P. The T-PDSN processes the MIP RRQ and then fonwards it on to the HA. Q. If the MIP RRQ is accepted, the HA responds with a MIP RRP with a reply<br>
code of 0. R. The T-PDSN forwards the MIP RRP to the mobile. The mobile may now send and receive bearer data via its MIP session. [1027]     If the target PDSN can not receive the P-P RRP correctly after several retransmissions, the target PDSN should indicate to the target RN in A11 RRP that the operation is failed,  In response, the T-RN will release the traffic channel.  In this third scenario, the target PDSN cannot receive any rpessages from the serving  PDSN,  eind therefore, the  MS  releases the traffic channel.     The responsiblllty for handoff falls to the MS, as the MS initiates the Communications, i.e., sessions, with the target network.   Note that for a given system, the radio network level handoff may have been completed successfully, however, the packet data network level must also accomplish a handoff from the S-PDSN to the T-PDSN.  The third scenario is illustrated in FIG. 3, wherein each labeled step is described as follows:<br>
A. The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the S-PDSN via the S-RN. The mobile may have multiple service instances allocated in the S-RN.<br><br><br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends pilot<br>
reports to the S-RN. Please note that the mobile stiil has airlink traffic<br>
channels to the S-RN and an IP session established to the S-PDSN.<br>
C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown).<br>
D.	The T-RN sends an A11 RRQ to the T-PDSN including the s bit set to 1 and<br>
the serving P-P address attribute set to the Pi IP address of the S-PDSN.<br>
E.	The T-PDSN sends a P-P RRQ including the s bit set to 1 to the S-PDSN's<br>
Pi IP address. The setting of the s bit indicates a request for a<br>
simultaneous binding at the S-PDSN.<br>
F.	The T-PDSN does not recelve a P-P RRP after a configurable number of<br>
retransmissions of the P-P RRQ.<br>
G.	The T-PDSN send an Al 1 RRP with the reply code set to other than O to<br>
the T-RN.<br>
H. The S-RN hands off the mobile's service instance(s) to the T-RN by<br>
sending handoff direction command to the mobile station, i.   The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion<br>
indication to the T-RN. J.  Upon completion of the handoff of the service instances, the T-RN release<br>
the traffic channel. K. The MS re-initiates the S033 to setup the traffic channel. The S033 refers<br>
to the data service option 33 as specified in IS707. L. T-RN sends Al 1 RRQ to set up R-P connection. M. T-PDSN replies with A11 RRP with result code set to 'O'. N. The MS inltiates PPP negotiation with the T-PDSN by sending it an LCP-<br>
configure-request. O. PPP negotiation is complete, For simple IP sessions, bearer traffic may now<br>
flow in both directions over the T-RN and T-PDSN. For MlP sessions, the<br>
behavior is as follows below. P. The T-PDSN sends a MIP agent advertisement to the mobile. Note that the<br>
mobile may first send a MIP agent solicitation to the T-PDSN (not shown). O. The mobile sends a MIP RRQ to the T-PDSN. R. The T-PDSN processes the MIP RRQ and then forwards it on to the HA.<br><br><br>
S. If the MIP RRQ is accepted, the HA responds with a MIP RRP with a reply code of 0.<br>
T. The T-PDSNforwards the MIP RRP to the mobile. The mobile may now send and receive bearer data via its MIP session. [1028] In a fourth scenario, the target network, and T-PDSN specifically, is unable to receive handoff Information from the source network, and S-PDSN specifically. The target network attempts to set up the PPP connections via all of the SI links. In other words, since the T-PDSN does not know which SI link to'use tor setting up the PPP connection, it sends the request Information on all links. In this case, the T-PDSN sends a Link Contrei Protocol (LCP) registration message on all SI links. In the present example, the MS desires two links, one for packet data, such as web accesses, and one for Voice over IP (VolP). The target PDSN can still indicate the target RN in Al 1 RRP that the operation is successful. And then the T-PDSN sends LCP Configure Request on all R-P connections to trigger the PPP negotiation. The PPP negotiation will occur over the PPP service instance.<br>
[1029] For the secondary packet service instance(s), LCP Configure Request is treated as packet data payload (for example, for Voice over IP, it is treated as RTP payload), therefore, it will be either discarded if the format is not correct or be passed to the application and is treated as error. After PPP session is setup, MCFTP can be used for setup the secondary packet service instance(s). Each labeled step in the call flow of FIG 4 is.described as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the S-PDSN<br>
via the S-RN. The mobile may have multiple service instances allocated in<br>
the S-RN.<br>

C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown here).<br>
D.	The T-RN sends an A11 RRQ to the T-PDSN including the s bit set to 1 and<br>
the serving P-P address attribute set to the Pi IP address of the S-PDSN.<br><br>
E.	The T-PDSN sends a P-P RRQ including the s bit set to 1 to the S-PDSN's<br>
Pi IP address. The setting of the s bit indicates a request tor a<br>
â¢ simultaneous binding at the S-PDSN.<br>
F.	The T-PDSN does not receive a P-P RRP after a configurable number of<br>
retransmissions of the P-P RRQ.<br>
G.	The T-PDSN sends an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>

sending handoff direction command to the mobile station. I.   The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion<br>
indication to the T-RN. J.  Upon completion of the handoff of the sen/ice instances, the T-RN sends<br>
A11 RRQ to T-PDSN. K. T-PDSN replies with A11 RRP.<br>
L. T-PDSN sends LCP Configure Request on all service instances. M. The PPP negotiation only occurs over PPP sen/ice instance. N. MCFTP sent over PPP service instance is used for setup flow treatment<br>
and channel treatment forsecondary service instance(s). O. For simple IP sessions, bearer traffic may now flow in both directions over<br>
the T-RN and T-PDSN. For MIP sessions, the behavior is as follows below. P. The T-PDSN sends a MIP agent advertisement to the mobile. Note that the<br>
mobile may first send a MIP agent solicitation to the T-PDSN (not shown). Q. The mobile sends a MIP RRQ to the T-PDSN.<br>
R. The T-PDSN processes the MIP RRQ and then fonwards it on to the HA. S. If the MIP RRQ is accepted, the HA responds with a MIP RRP with a reply<br>
code of 0. T. The T-PDSN fonwards the MIP RRP to the mobile. The mobile may now send and receive bearer data via lts MIP session. [1030]     In a fifth scenario, illustrated in FIG. 5, the MS again desires multiple Sis, specifically two, however, the main PPP SI is dormant.  While the main SI is dormant, the corresponding A10 is still in place.    For the Dormant Service Instance, the MS is responsible to trigger Dormant Handoff after detecting the Packet Zone ID (PZID) is changed upon receiving In-traffic System Parameter Message (ISPM) from the traffic channel.   The PZID identifies the packet data<br><br>
network supporting the MS. There are two problems with this scenario. First, if the MS fails to receive the ISPM, the call is dropped as there is no A10 and no P-P connection for the PPP Service instance. Second, the dormant sen/ice instance has to be transitioned to the Active state. The dormant service may not be required, and therefore nnal^ing it active to accomplish handoff is a waste of resources. Each iabeled step is illustrated in FIG. 5, and described as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has multiple sessions established to the S-PDSN via the<br>
S-RN. The mobile station has multiple sen/ice instance(s) in Dormant (for<br>
example, PPP service Instance) and has multiple service instances active<br>
and allocated in the S-RN.<br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends pilot<br>
reports to the S-RN. At this time, the mobile still has airlink traffic channels<br>
to the S-RN and an IP session established to the S-PDSN.<br>
C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown here).<br>
D.	The T-RN sends an A11 RRQ to the T-PDSN including the s bit set to 1 and<br>

G.	The T-PDSN sends an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
H. At this point, fonward direction bearer traffic arriving at the S-PDSN is bicast<br>
to the S-RN and the T-PDSN for the Active Service Instance. The T-RN<br>
may buffer the last N packets, where N is implementation dependent.<br>
Reverse direction bearer traffic traverses only the S-RN and the S-PDSN. I.   The S-RN hands off the mobile's service instance(s) to the T-RN by<br>
sending handoff direction command to the mobile station. J. The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion<br>
indication to the T-RN. K. Upon completion of the handoff of the sen/ice instances, the T-RN sends an<br>
A11 RRQ with the s bit set to O and including an active start airlink record to<br>
the T-PDSN.<br><br>
L. The T-PDSN sends a P-P RRQ with the s bit set to O and including an active start airlink record to the S-PDSN. The active start airiink record sent is the same ene that was received trom the T-RN.<br>

N. The T-PDSN send an Al 1 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
O. The T-RN sends system Information via In-Traffic System Parameter Message (ISPM) including the new PacketZone ID (PZID).<br>
P. The MS detects PZID is changed, the MS will send Ehanced Origination Message (EOM) to set up S033 which is main service instance as an example.<br>
Q. The T-RN sends A11 RRQ to setup Al O connection.<br>
R. The T-PDSN sends P-P RRQ to setup P-P connection.<br>
S. The S-PDSN replies with P-P RRP.<br>
T. The T-PDSN replies with A11 RRP.<br>
U. T-RN sends service connect to the MS to connect PPP service instance.<br>
V. The MS replies with service connect completion.<br>
W. Upon the PPP service instance is connected, T-RN sends A11 RRQ to start accounting record.<br>
X. The T-PDSN sends P-P RRQ to S-PDSN.<br>
Y. The S-PDSN replies with P-P RRP.<br>
Z. T-PDSN replies with A11 RRP.<br>
AA.	At this point, forward direction bearer traffic for both PPP service<br>
instances and Secondary Service Instance are tunneled from the S-PDSN to the T-PDSN over the P-P interface, then switched onto the appropriate A10 session and delivered to the T-RN. Reverse direction bearer traffic is sent from the mobile to the T-RN, then over the appropriate A10 session to the T-PDSN. The T-PDSN tunnels this traffic over the P-P interface to the S-PDSN. Note that the P-P session may be periodically refreshed by the T-PDSN sending a P-P RRQ to the S-PDSN.<br>

DD.	The S-RN indicates that the session will be terminated by sending an<br>
A11 RRQ to the S-PDSN with the lifetime set to O, including an active stop<br>
accounting record.	*'<br>
EE.	The S-PDSN indicates that the session is released by sending an<br>
Al 1 RRP to the S-RN with the lifetime set to 0. Note that the S-PDSN does not delete the associated PPP context because it is being used by the mobile via the P-P interface. [1031] In a sixth scenario, illustrated in FIG. 6, when the P-P Connection is successfully established for secondary Service Instances with S-PDSN, S-PDSN is responsible to trigger the set up of P-P connection for dormant PPP service instance or other dormant sen/ice instances as the S-PDSN has knovvledge as to which service is In Dormant Mode. The T-PDSN may start to trigger the set up of AIO connections for the dormant service instances. The labeled steps of the call flow of FIG. 6 are described as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has multiple sessions established to the S-PDSN via the<br>
S-RN. The mobile station has multiple service instance(s) in Dormant (for<br>
example, PPP service Instance) and has multiple service instances active<br>
and allocated in the S-RN.<br>

F.	The S-PDSN replies with a P-P RRP with the reply code set to 0.<br>
G.	The T-PDSN sends an Al 1 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
H. Because S-PDSN knows PPP sen/ice instance is in Dormant mode, S-<br>
PDSN will sends P-P RRQ to T-PDSN to set up P-P connection. I.   T-PDSN replies with P-P RRP with result code set to 'O'. There are two options here.<br><br>
Option 1:<br>
J. The T-PDSN sends Al 1 RUP to T-RN to request for establishing R-P connection for PPP service Instance.<br>
K. The T-RN replies with A11 RAK.<br>

M. T-PDSN replies with Al 1 RRP with code set to 'O'.<br>
Option 2:<br>
N. The T-PDSN sends A11 RRQ to establish R-P connection for PPP service Instance.<br>
O. The T-RN replies with A11 RRP with code set to 'O'.<br>
P. At this point, forward direction bearer traffic arriving at the S-PDSN is bicast to the S-RN and the T-PDSN for both PPP Service Instance and Secondary Service Instance. The T-RN may buffer the last N packets, where N is implementation dependent. Reverse direction bearer traffic traverses only the S-RN and the S-PDSN.<br>

U. The S-PDSN replies with a P-P RRP with the reply code set to 0.<br>
V. The T-PDSN send an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
W. At this point, forward direction bearer traffic for both PPP service instances and Secondary Service Instance are tunneled from the S-PDSN to the T-PDSN over the P-P interface, then switched onto the appropriate A10 session and delivered to the T-RN. Reverse direction bearer traffic is sent from the mobile to the T-RN, then over the appropriate AIO session to the T-PDSN. The T-PDSN tunnels this traffic over the P-P interface to the S-<br><br>
PDSN. Note that the P-P session may be periodically refreshed by the T-<br>
PDSN sending a P-P RRQ to the S-PDSN. X. The S-PDSN initiates a teardown of the mobile's A10/A11 session(s) to the<br>
S-RN by sending an A11 RUP to the S-RN. Y. The S-RN responds with an Al 1 RAK. Z. The S-RN indicates that the session wiil be terminated by sending an A11<br>

AA.	The S-PDSN Indicates that the session is released by sending an<br>
A11 RRP to the S-RN with the lifetime set to 0. Note that the S-PDSN does<br>
not delete the associated PPP context because it is being used by the<br>
mobile via the P-P interface. [1032] The scenarios and examples discussed hereinabove assume a same version of protocols for the serving netwerk and the target network. In other words, these examples and scenarios assumed that the S-PDSN and the T-PDSN had similar capabilities. For example, each was able to support multiple Service Instances. Consider the situation where the packet data networks and/or the radio networks do not have similar capabilities, but rather, one is able to handie multiple Sis, while the other is not.<br>
[1033] When the serving network has capability to support multiple Sis, and the target network does not, the system must determine which one to terminate and how to effect such termination. For example, when the handoff occurs from low revision PDSN (18-835 Release A or lower) to high revision PDSN (IS-835 Release B or higher), there are no problems because IS-835-A PDSN can only support one packet data service instance. In this case, after handoff to the target PDSN, the secondary sen/ice instances can be setup. When the serving network has capability for only a single SI, as specified in lS-95. Also cdma2000 Release O specifies support for a single SI. Starting from cdma2000 Release A, multiple SI are specified to be supported, and the target has capability for multiple Sis, the responsibility is on the MS to initiate the additional Sis with the target network after handoff.<br>
[1034] A seventh scenario is illustrated in FIG. 7 and with respect to FIG. 13, wherein the target radio network, T-RN, is not able to support multiple Sis.  Note<br><br>
that the serving radio network, S-RN, knows that the target network cannot support sessions that are active in the serving network prior to handoff. For example, when the handoff occurs from high revision PDSN (IS-835 Release B or higher) to low revision PDSN (IS-835 Release A or lower), if there are secondary service instances established, how to handie these multiple service instances becomes a problem. In this situation, because the serving RN knows the target RN cannot support concurrent services (multiple R-P connections), the serving RN only performs handoff for the main service instance (PPP Service instance) to T-RN. The MS may also indicate to the user that the secondary service instances are dropped because of roaming to a lower revisions area. Each of the labeled steps in the call flow of FIG. 7 is described as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the S-PDSN<br>
via the S-RN. The mobile may have multiple service instances allocated in<br>
the S-RN.<br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends pilot<br>
reports to the S-RN. Please note that the mobile still has airlink traffic<br>
channels to the S-RN and an IP session established to the S-PDSN.<br>
C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown).<br>
D.	Because S-RN knows the T-RN cannot support concurrent sen/ice, S-RN<br>
hands off the mobile's PPP service instance to the T-RN by sending<br>
handoff direction command to the mobile station.<br>
E.	The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion<br>
Indication to the T-RN.<br>
F.	Upon completion of the handoff of the service instances, the T-RN sends an<br>
A11 RRQ with the s bit set to O and Including an active start airlink record to<br>
the T-PDSN.<br>
G.	The T-PDSN send an A11 RRP with the reply code set to O to the T-RN.<br>
H. The T-PDSN initiates PPP negotiation with the mobile by sending it an<br>
LGP-configure-request. I.   PPP negotiation is complete. For simple IP sessions, bearer traffic may now flow in both directions over the T-RN and T-PDSN. For MIP sessions, the behavior is as follows below.<br><br><br>
J.  The T-PDSN sends a MIP agent advertisement to the mobile. Note that the mobile may first send a MIP agent solicitation to the T-PDSN (not shown).<br>
K. The mobile sends a MIP RRQ to the T-PDSN.<br>
L. The T-PDSN processes the MIP RRQ and then fonwards it on to the HA.<br>
M. If the MIP RRQ is accepted, the HA responds with a MIP RRP with a reply code of 0.<br>
N. The T-PDSN fonwards the MIP RRP to the mobile. The mobile may now send and receive bearer data via its MIP session. [1035] FIG. 13 illustrates the system 100 including a T-PDSN 144, which may be capable of multiple Sis, but is illustrated supporting the one SI allowed by T-RN 148. After successful handoff to the target netwerk, the main SI is established with T-RN 148 and the associated AIO connection is established between T-RN 148 and T-PDSN 144.<br>
[1036] In an eight scenario, illustrated in FIG. 8 and with respect to FIG. 12, the target RN can support concurrent service, i.e., multiple service instances, but the corresponding T-PDSN can not support multiple sen/ice instances. As illustrated in the call flow of FIG. 8, the T-RN sends an Al 1 RRQ to request for bicasting upon handoff is requested by the S-RN, Since the old revision of T-PDSN doesn't support P-P connection and bicasting establishment, the T-PDSN will send Al 1 RRP to indicate failure. In this case, T-RN doesn't know which is PPP service Instance, the T-RN has to release traffic channel. The MS should indicate the user call is dropped because of roaming to the low revision area. If needed, the MS will start to set up S033 from the beginning. Each of the labeled step of FIG. 8 is described as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the S-PDSN<br>
via the S-RN. The mobile may have multiple service instances allocated in<br>
the S-RN.<br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends pilot<br>
reports to the S-RN. Please note that the mobile still has airlink traffic<br>
channels to the S-RN and an IP session established to the S-PDSN.<br>
O. S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown here). D. The T-RN sends an Al 1 RRQ to the T-PDSN including the s bit set to 1 and the serving P-P address attribute set to the Pi IP address of the S-PDSN.<br><br>
E.	Since the T-PDSN does not support fast P-P interface handoff, the T-PDSN<br>
sends an Al 1 RRP with the reply code set to other than O to the T-RN.<br>
F.	The S-RN hands off the mobile's service instance(s) to the TURN by.<br>
sending handoff direction command to the mobile station.<br>
G.	The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion<br>
indication to the T-RN.<br>
H. Upon completion of the handoff of the service instances, the T-RN releases the traffic channel since it doesn't know which service instance is PPP service instance. I.   The MS re-initiates the S033 to setup the traffic channel. J. T-RN sends A11 RRQ to set up R-P connection. K. T-PDSN replies with A11 RRP with result code set to 'O'. L. The MS initiates PPP negotiation with the T-PDSN by sending it an LCP-<br>
configure-reqjest. M. PPP negotiation is complete. Por simple IP sessions, bearer traffic may now flow in both directions over the T-RN and T-PDSN. For MIP sessions, the behavior is as follows below. N. The T-PDSN sends a MIP agent advertisement to the mobile. Note that the<br>
mobile may first send a MIP agent solicitation to the T-PDSN (not shown). O. The mobile sends a MIP RRQ to the T-PDSN.<br>
P. The T-PDSN processes the MIP RRQ and then forwards it on to the HA. Q. If the MIP RRQ Is accepted, the HA responds with a MIP RRP with a reply<br>
code of 0. R. The T-PDSN fonwards the MIP RRP to the mobile. The mobile may now send and receive bearer data vla its MIP session. [1037]     FIG. 12 illustrates the system 100 including a T-PDSN 134 which is not capable to support multiple sessions. Therefore, even though, the T-RN 118 may support multiple Sis, only the main SI has a corresponding AIO connection established with T-PDSN 134.<br>
[1038] In a ninth scenario, illustrated in FIG. 9, during the handoff between T-RN and S-RN, the PPP service instance infomiation is also exchanged. Therefore, when The T-RN receives failure indication from T-PDSN, the T-RN only release<br><br>
"^0 03/019716	PCT/lIS()3/07399<br>
21<br>
the secondary service instance and keep the PPP service instance connected. Each of the labeled steps of the call flow of FIG. 9 is described as follows:<br>
A.	The mobile station has one or more sessions established to the S-PDSN<br>
via the S-RN. The mobile may have multiple service instances allocated in<br>
the S-RN.<br>
B.	The mobile station detects the pilot signal strength changes and sends pilot<br>
reports to the S-RN. Please note that the mobile still has airlink traffic<br>
channels to the S-RN and an IP session established to the S-PDSN.<br>
C.	S-RN sends handoff request message to T-RN via MSC (not shown here).<br>
Also the S-RN indicate the PPP service instance to T-RN.<br>
D.	The T-RN sends an A11 RRQ to the T-PDSN including the s bit set to 1 and<br>
the serving P-P address attribute set to the Pi IP address of the S-PDSN.<br>
E.	Since the T-PDSN does not support fast P-P interface handoff, the T-PDSN<br>
sends an Al 1 RRP with the reply code set to other than O to the T-RN.<br>
F.	The S-RN hands off the mobile's service instance(s) to the T-RN by<br>
sending handoff direction command to the mobile station.<br>
G.	The mobile station handoffs to the T-RN and sends handoff completion<br>
indication to the T-RN.<br>
H. Since the T-RN knows which service instance is PPP service instance, the<br>
T-RN sends Al 1 RRQ to set up R-P connection tor PPP service Instance. I.   T-PDSN replies with A11 RRP with result code set to 'O'. J.  The T-RN also sends service connect to the MS to release the Secondary<br>
Service Instance and maintain the PPP Service Instance. K. T-PDSN will trigger the PPP negotiation by sending LCP Configure<br>
Request. L. PPP negotiation is complete. For simple IP sessions, bearer traffic may now<br>
flow in both directions over the T-RN and T-PDSN. For MIP sessions, the<br>
behavior is as follows below. M. The T-PDSN sends a MIP agent advertisement to the mobile. Note that the<br>
