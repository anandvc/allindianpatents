				<td>CLAMPING AND/OR BRAKING DEVICE<br>
The invention concerns a clamping and/or braking device.<br>
Clamping or braking devices are known in the most varied embodiments for the<br>
most varied application cases. Thus, a braking device of a linear guide is known in EP-<br>
A-0 936 366 that has a supporting body and can be moved along a guide track. The<br>
supporting body has brake shoes, which act on the two longitudinal sides. The<br>
supporting body is shaped like an H and has a thin, elastically flexible crosslink and two<br>
lower legs, with which it grips the guide track. A brake shoe is located between a lower<br>
leg and the guide track. The supporting body is provided with two upper legs, which,<br>
together, form a holding space with the crosslink, in which a force-producing means,<br>
acting on the upper leg, is provided. This can be hydraulically or pneumatically<br>
actuatable toggle lever mechanics or a piezoelectric actuator. Moreover, a hydraulically<br>
or pneumatically actuatable wedge valve can be provided as a force transducer, which<br>
is conducted in a formed space, which tapers in the longitudinal direction of the brake<br>
device, between the upper legs of the supporting body. In all cases, a bending of the<br>
elastic crosslink takes place due to the force pressurizatioin of the two upper legs, so<br>
that the two lower legs are moved inwards with the brake shoes or apply pressure on<br>
the guide track with a large force.<br>
The disadvantage with this known brake device, in connection with the use of an<br>
electromechanical transducer such as a piezoelectric element, is, in particular, its<br>
sensitivity with respect to vibrations or other mechanical loads.<br>
The use of a toggle lever or a wedge valve, just like an electromechanical<br>
transducer, means a high installation or production expense.<br>
In addition, there is, in particular with clamping devices, the requirement of<br>
sufficiently high clamping forces, which, with known devices, can be implemented only<br>
with a relatively high construction and thus financial expense.<br>
From US 5,855,446, a hydraulic clamping bushing is known, which is aligned on<br>
a shaft and can be connected to it, for example, in a stationary manner. The bushing<br>
essentially has a stable bushing body, which is located at a distance around a drive<br>
shaft. Adjacent to these bushing bodies and facing the shaft, a chamber which can be<br>
acted on with pressure is provided. A side wall of this chamber, which extends<br>
essentially parallel to the shaft is used here, at the same time, as a braking element,<br>
which with the action of pressure on the chamber is pressed against the shaft by<br>
the expansion of the chamber, in order to produce a friction-locking connection. A<br>
Î£-shaped formation of the laterally adjacent walls of the chamber is meant to<br><br>
prevent the bushing from aligning crooked with respect to the wall when the pressure acts on<br>
chamber. The X-shaped side walls of the chamber make possible, in the case of pressure<br>
pressurization, an expansion of these side walls in a radial direction toward the shaft, before the<br>
increasing chamber pressure also presses the chamber wall, running parallel to the shaft, against<br>
the shaft. Thus, the bushing can be aligned at right angles to the shaft axis, before the tortional<br>
connection is produced.<br>
This clamping device does not have a favorable power transmission for the creation of a<br>
higher pressing force. Furthermore, in its shape and in particular., in its placement possibility<br>
relative to the bushing body, the chamber is limited. The braking effect can be attained here only<br>
by acting on the chamber with excess pressure, and the actual braking element, which must<br>
perhaps transfer high driving-forces, is not firmly connected to the bushing body, but rather only<br>
via the inevitably relatively unstable pressure chamber.<br>
From WO 01/34990 A1 from the applicant, a clamping and/or braking device is known,<br>
in which a chamber which can be acted on with pressure is provided on a basic body; in at least<br>
one partial area of at least one deformable or tension-resistant and/or pressure-resistant wall, the<br>
chamber is limited. The limitation of the chamber opposite the wall can also be constructed like<br>
the first wall. However, it can also be a rigid part of a body. Preferably, the walls lie at a<br>
relatively small distance from one another. The forces resulting from the deformation of the<br>
chamber are conducted, at least in part, in the direction of or along the wall and in the area of the<br>
connection of the wall to a basic body are introduced into the lattter. If one selects the point of<br>
attack of such forces on the basic body, and if this basic body is, at least partially, elastically<br>
deformable, then the forces can be transferred, for example, into the clamping or braking areas<br>
via this basic body on other sites of the basic body. A corresponding braking or clamping means<br>
in these areas can then be moved, by means of the forces, into a pressurizing position or out of it,<br>
so as to brake or release a guide element or an element which has to be clamped or braked. Both<br>
applied excess or reduced pressure in the chamber can be used thereby, in order to introduce both<br>
tractive and compressive forces to the basic body. Of course, before and after the introduction of<br>
force, the clamping and/or braking areas are still engaged with the guide element or the element<br>
to be clamped or braked, wherein, however, changes in the pressurizing forces between the<br>
clamping and/or braking areas and the other element result.<br>
This known clamping and/or braking device is based on the knowledge that when acted<br>
on by a reduced or excess pressure, a suitable chamber tends to a deformation. If this chamber, to<br>
a great extent, is formed by at least one approximately plane wall, then the excess or reduced<br>
pressure in the chamber first causes a deformation in a first direction running essentially<br><br>
Perpendicular to this wall. In order to yield to the deformation (expansion or contraction) in this first<br>
direction, the result from this, in a correspondingly reverse manner, is a contraction or expansion of<br>
the chamber in a second direction generally running perpendicular; to the first direction (that is,<br>
essentially parallel to the wall). The fact is used thereby that low forces or deformations in the first<br>
direction produce large forces in the second direction, which can be used to break or clamp or to<br>
release pretensioned clamping or braking devices.<br>
On the basis of this state of the art, the goal of the invention is to create a clamping and/or<br>
braking device, which can be produced with lower construction expense and with which sufficiently<br>
high braking or clamping forces can be produced in a simple manner.<br>
In contrast to the disclosures of US 3363027 and US 45443887, the present invention<br>
provides a clamping and/or braking device, wherein a plate-shaped element has radial slots<br>
opening inwards, and second end of the element is formed by the inner end of the element, or the<br>
element has radial slots opening outwards, and the second end of the element is formed by the<br>
outer end of the element. Further, at least one sealing element is provided at the inner and/or outer<br>
surfaces in relation to the pressure space of the element, at least in the area of the slots.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides clamping and/or braking device comprising a housing, in<br>
which at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element is held, which element: is supported with a<br>
first end with respect to a stop area of the housing and which with a second end transmits clamping<br>
and/or braking forces to an object or a pressurisable element, which transmits clamping and/or<br>
braking forces to the object, wherein<br>
a)	said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element has at least one bending area which is<br>
convex in the initial state and is formed so as to be pressure-resistant and yet elastically bendable<br>
so that the bending area forms a resilient element between the stop area of the housing and a<br>
pressurisable end of the ring-shaped, plate-shaped element,<br>
b)	a substantially tight pressure space is formed between the convex side of said at least one<br>
bending area of said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element and the housing, which space<br>
can be acted upon by the excess pressure of a pressure medium which can be supplied to the<br>
housing, and<br>
c)	said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element and its at least one bending area are<br>
formed so that, when the pressure space is acted upon by excess pressure, as a result of a<br>
reduction of the curvature of the bending area, in order to obtain predetermined clamping and/or<br>
braking forces, a movement of the second end of said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped<br><br>
element or a movement of the second end of said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element<br>
together with the pressurisable element takes place in the direction of the object or an increase in<br>
the clamping and/or braking forces transmissible to the object by the second end of said at least<br>
one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element or the pressurisable element is brought about,<br>
characterised in that<br>
i) said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element has radial slots<br>
which are open inwards, wherein the second end of the ring-shaped,<br>
plate-shaped element is formed by the inner end of the ring-shaped,<br>
plate-shaped element, or<br>
ii) said at least one ring-shaped, plate-shaped element has radial slots<br>
which are open outwards, wherein the second end of the ring-shaped,<br>
plate-shaped element is formed by the outer end of the ring-shaped,<br>
plate-shaped element, and<br>
iii) one or a plurality of sealing element(s) is/are provided at the inner and /or<br>
outer surfaces, in relation to the pressure space, of said at least one ring-<br>
shaped, plate-shaped element, at least in the area of the slots.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that by means of at least one plate-like element,<br>
which is located in a housing and has a convex bending area, a clamping and/or braking device can<br>
be produced at low cost; this device can also produce very high clamping and/or braking forces by<br>
means of an only gaseous pressure medium-that is, pneumatically. However, it is clear that a<br>
hydraulic actuation of the device is also possible. The function of the device is guaranteed by the<br>
convex formation of at least one bending area of the plate-like element, with application on its<br>
convex side of an excess pressure from a pressure medium, wherein a corresponding pressure<br>
space is provided on the side of the bending area, which curves convexly outwards. With pressure<br>
acting on the bending area, its curvature is reduced; so that the expansion of the plate-like element<br>
between two ends is increased, of which one is supported on the housing and the other acts,<br>
directly or indirectly, via a pressurizable element, on the object to be clamped or braked. The plate-<br>
like element is thereby so pressure-resistant and constructed so elastically deformable in the at<br>
least one bending area that between the two ends, an elastic element is formed. The pressure<br>
resistance of the plate-like element must be designed in such a way that when a predetermined,<br>
maximum permissible force is exerted on the second end (pressurizing end), a sharp bending does<br>
not occur.<br><br>
Of course, a corresponding free space, which makes possible a sufficient<br>
bending of the bending area, must be present on the concave side of the bending area,<br>
turned away from the pressure application side. This free space can be connected to the<br>
surroundingsâthat is, to the air pressure of the surroundings. However, it can also be<br>
closed airtight so that the bending of the bending area must take place, against an<br>
increasing pressure, in the free space.<br>
Contrary to the known device of the applicant, it is possible, with<br>
these embodiments, to produce or to change clamping and/or braking<br>
forces, without hereby having to deform an essentially rigid body. In this<br>
way, aside from a simple construction, a small model results. The<br><br><br>
device is, moreover, simple to produce, since only the plate-like element must be placed in the<br>
housing.<br>
Contrary to the known clamping bushings, which have relatively soft walls, and which<br>
increase the distance between a pressurizable element and a base element when acted on with<br>
excess pressure, it is also possible with the device in accordance with the invention to produce a<br>
predetermined clamping and/or braking force, with which the object to be clamped or braked is<br>
acted on, even in a pressure-less state during a corresponding pretensioned installation of the<br>
device in the complete device. In this way, for example, a control of the device is possible, in<br>
such a way that a change between a braked (in the pressure-less state) movement of the<br>
pressurized object and a complete clamping of the object (with a sufficient pressurization)<br>
results.<br>
The more frequent use of the device in accordance with the invention, however, is the one<br>
where in the pressure-less starting state, the object is not acted on and with a pressurization of the<br>
device, is braked or clamped.<br>
With a linearly functioning clamping and/or braking device, the at least one plate-like<br>
element can have a, for example, rectangular shape, wherein the entire element can be convexly<br>
curved between two edges. The first and the second ends are then formed by those edges or end<br>
areas between which the curvature runs. At least in the area of the bending (if the entire plate-<br>
shaped element is not bent), the side edges must be essentially sealed off with respect to the<br>
housing (a small leakage can be tolerated, under certain circumstances, if, for example,<br>
compressed air is used as the pressure medium and the required pressure can be attained and<br>
maintained in spite of the leakage)<br>
According to one development of the invention, a pressurizable element is provided,<br>
which is constructed in one piece with the housing and as a pant of the housing, or which is<br>
constructed as a part connected to the housing in a detachable manner, wherein the pressurizable<br>
element is constructed deformably in such a way that with a pressure application of the pressure<br>
space, a movement of at least one section of the pressurizable element takes place in the direction<br>
of the object or the transferable clamping and/or braking forces, produced by the at least one<br>
plate-like element, are transferred to the object. With such a deformable pressurizable element,<br>
the pressure space can be sealed of in a simple manner, with respect to the at least one plate-like<br>
elementânamely on the pressurizing edge or the second end of the plate-like element, with<br>
respect to the pressurizable element. Basically, however, a pressurizable element is not connected<br>
to the housing can also be used, which, for example, can be constructed correspondingly large for<br>
the distribution of the pressing force on a greater surface. Moreover, the pressurizable element<br><br>
can be used to adapt the pressing surface (constructed then on the pressurizable element) to the<br>
shape of the object.<br>
In a development of the invention, the first end of the at least one plate-like element can<br>
be connected to the housing, especially if in the realization of a linearly acting clamping and/or<br>
braking device, a pressurizable element not connected to the housing is used or the object is<br>
acted on directly by the second end of the at least one plate-like element.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the first end of the at least one plate-like<br>
part, however, is supported, without a firm connection, against the housing. With the presence of<br>
a pressurizable element, the second end of the at least one plate-like part is also preferably<br>
supported, without a firm connection, against the pressurizable element. In this way, a simple<br>
installation of the device results.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the at least one-plate-shaped element is<br>
annular, preferably, circular, so as to create a device that makes possible the clamping of bar- or<br>
rod-shaped objects, in particular, in the cross section of circular-cylindrical objects.<br>
The ring-shaped, plate-like element can be shaped convexly, in the starting state, via<br>
essentially the entire radial cross section, wherein essentially the entire ring-shaped wall of the<br>
ring-shaped, plate-like element serves as the bending area Such a plate-like element can be<br>
produced very simply and at low cost and can be used also for a large number of variants.<br>
The at least one ring-shaped, plate-like element preferably has radial slits that are open<br>
inwardly or outwardly, wherein, preferably, the second end-that is, the pressurizing end of the<br>
ring-shaped, plate-like elementâis formed by the inside or outside end of the ring-shaped, plate-<br>
like element. The slits preferably extend to just before the opposite end of the ring and are<br>
present in such a number that proceeding from the closed ring area, individual sections extend<br>
inwardly or outwardly. These sections reduce the required deformation of the ring in the azimuth<br>
direction, if the curvature of the convex bending area is reduced during pressurization.<br>
With such slit, ring-shaped, plate-like elements, it is possible to provide one or more<br>
sealing elements, preferably, in the shape of a deformable layer, on a part or on the entire surface<br>
of the plate-like element, on the inside and/or outside surfaces of the plate-like elements, relative<br>
to the pressure space, at least in the area of the slits. In this way, a common pressure space can be<br>
used for the individual sections between the slits. The sealing of the slits can, for example, take<br>
place by vulcanizing on a relatively hard, but nevertheless, sufficiently deformable rubber layer.<br>
Such a layer can be produced even on the side of the ring-shaped, plate-like element, turned away<br>
from the pressurization, without the danger of loosening the layer during a pressurization.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the bending of the at least one bending area<br><br>
of the at least one plate-like element is limited in such a way that after the discontinuation of the<br>
pressurizing of the pressure space with excess pressure as a result of the elastic effect of the at<br>
least one bending area, it returns to the starting state. One designates, as the starting state, the<br>
pressure-less state, wherein in this state also, depending on the dimensioning or installation of<br>
the clamping and/or braking device, the at least one bending area can be pretensioned. A<br>
corresponding stop for the bending area can be formed, for example, by an inside housing wall.<br>
According to one development of the invention, several plate-like elements, arranged<br>
essentially parallel to one another, can be provided, whose second ends have a predetermined<br>
distance to one another, in order to transfer clamping and/or braking forces to the object, via a<br>
prespecified expanded area, wherein for each plate-like element, a separate pressure space or for<br>
several or all plate-like elements, a common pressure space can be formed.<br>
When using several plate-like elements, at least one pair of plate-like elements can be<br>
provided, whose first and second ends are directly adjacent or at a close distance to one another,<br>
and whose convex bending areas run convexly outwards, relative to the other plate-like element<br>
of the pair of plate-like elements, wherein a common pressure space is provided for the<br>
pressurization of the bending areas of the two plate-like elements of a pair. This variant offers the<br>
advantage that the two plate-like elements are pressed against one another during a pressurization<br>
and so the space required between the two elements can be sealed off with lower pressure in a<br>
simple manner. For example, the rubber coating mentioned in the preceding can be provided<br>
inside or can be a sealing element connected to the inside surfaces of the plate-like elements.<br>
In addition, the plate-like elements of a pair can be designed in such a way that they lie<br>
close to one another, with at least one partial area of the sides facing one another in an ending<br>
state when acted on with an excess pressure greater or equal to a prespecified maximum pressure,<br>
wherein the ending state is defined by a suitable formation of the bending areas in such a way<br>
that from the ending state, an automatic return to the pressure-less starting state takes place. In<br>
this way, a plate-like element is used as a stop for the at least one bending area of the other plate-<br>
like element.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a pressurizable element can be provided,<br>
which is constructed rigid in the entire area in which the several plate-like elements are active. In<br>
this way, a more uniform transfer of the clamping and/or braking forces can be attained on the<br>
object.<br>
With all embodiments of the invention, the creation of the clamping and/or braking<br>
forces, however, takes place exclusively or at least, for the most part, predominantly due to one<br>
pressurization and the bending hereby produced and thus the change of the effective expansion of<br><br>
the plate-like elements between the two ends. This is also true for the case that one<br>
surface of the pressurizable element is acted on completely or partially with pressure, if<br>
the bending area(s) of the plate-like elements are acted on with pressure. The forces<br>
hereby produced, which are comparable with the forces arising with common clamping<br>
bushings, can be practically neglected however.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the housing and the pressurizable<br>
element can be designed as essentially H-shaped bodies, wherein the at least one<br>
plate-like element and the pressure space are provided between the essentially parallel,<br>
upper legs of the H-shaped body, wherein clamping and/or braking areas are provided<br>
on the essentially parallel, lower legs of the H-shaped body for the transfer of the<br>
clamping and/or braking forces to the object and wherein the H-shaped body is<br>
elastically deformable in the area of the middle crosslink and/or the connecting areas of<br>
the middle crosslink with the legs of the H.<br>
In a similar manner, the housing and the pressurizable element can be designed<br>
as essentially U-shaped bodies, wherein the at least one plate-like element and the<br>
pressure space are provided between the essentially parallel legs of the U-shaped body,<br>
wherein clamping and/or braking areas are provided on the essentially parallel legs of<br>
the H-shaped body for the transfer of the clamping and/or braking forces on the object<br>
and wherein the U-shaped body is elastically deformable in the area of the base of the U<br>
and/or in the area of the legs of the U.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention can be deduced from the preferred<br>
embodiments described hereinafter.<br>

Figure 6, a schematic cross section through a fifth embodiment of a clamping and/or<br>
braking device according to the invention for the realization of a linear guide.<br>
The embodiment of a clamping and/or braking device 1, shown in Figure 1 in a schematic<br>
longitudinal section, has a ring-shaped housing 3, which consists of a first part 5 with a ring-<br>
shaped recess 7 and a second part 9, which is connected to the first part 5, for example, screwed<br>
to it. In the recess 7, between the first and second housing part 5, 9, a ring-shaped, plate-like<br>
element 11 is located. The ring-shaped, plate-like element 11 is shaped slightly convex in the<br>
radial section and applies pressure on the circumferential wall of the ring-shaped recess 7 of the<br>
first housing part 5 with its outside end or its outside boundary 1 la<br>
As can be seen from Figure lb, the ring-shaped, plate-like element 11, consisting, for<br>
example, of a steel sheet, can be connected, on one side, to a sealing element 13, for example, a<br>
relatively hard, but still sufficiently deformable rubber ring. The ring-shaped, plate-like element<br>
11 is, as shown in Figures 2a and 2b, provided with a large number of slits 14, which proceeding<br>
from an outside boundary area 11c, which is also closed in the shape of a ring, run radially<br>
inwards and open toward the inside.<br>
The ring-shaped, plate-like element 11 defines, together with the sealing element 13, on<br>
its convex side, together with the inside wall of the first housing part 7, a pressure space 15, to<br>
which a pressure medium can be supplied, for example, compressed air. Of course, however, a<br>
liquid pressure medium can also be used. The pressure space 15 is constructed open toward the<br>
inside in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 and must be sealed off, with respect to the object 17<br>
to be acted on, for example, a rotatable shaft. This can take place by means of corresponding<br>
sealing elements 19, which can be designed as O rings. The O rings 19 can be taken up in<br>
grooves in the inside walls of the first and second housing part 5, 9.<br>
The ring-shaped, plate-like element 11 lies close to the inside wall of the second housing<br>
part 9 in the embodiment example shown in Figure 1, with its outside and inside boundaries 11a,<br>
11b, wherein the sealing element sufficiently seals off the space between the concave surface of<br>
the element 11 and the inside wall of the housing part 9. In this respect, an annular area 13a, 13b<br>
of the sealing element can be constructed on the outside and inside boundary. The inside annular<br>
area 13b can be designed so far, in its radial expansion, that it lies close to the inside wall of the<br>
housing part 9, at least with a partial area over the entire movement path of the element 11. The<br>
space between the concave side of the element 11 and the housing part 9 can also be connected to<br>
the surroundings, via one or more (not depicted) canals.<br>
If the pressure medium is conducted under a certain pressure to the pressure space 15, via<br><br>
one or more (not depicted) supply canals, then the ring-shaped, plate-like element 11 is<br>
bent in the direction of the second housing part 9-that is, the curvature is reduced. In<br>
this way, the sections of the element 11, stretching inwards between the slits 14, are<br>
moved, with its inside boundary 11b, further inwards in the direction of the object 17, so<br>
that a desired braking or clamping force can be exerted on the object by a certain<br>
pressure of the pressure medium. The element 11 must, of course, be so dimensioned<br>
and be made of such a material that at least in one bending area, there is a sufficient<br>
deformability and moreover, the element 11 is constructed sufficiently pressure-resistant<br>
as a whole that even with the maximum producible clamping or braking force, which<br>
acts on the inside end of the element 11 or is exerted on the object 17 by it, no sharp<br>
bending of the element 11 or even a plastic deformation occur.<br>
The inside wall of the second housing part 9 is also used as a stop for the ring-<br>
shaped, plate-like element 11, so that even with high pressures, an abrupt reverting of<br>
the convex curvature to a concave curvature cannot occur. Moreover, the inside wall of<br>
the second housing part 9 and/or the ring-shaped, plate-like element 1 or the sealing<br>
element 13 can be constructed in such a way that the cuivature of the element 11 is<br>
reduced, as a maximum, so much that with a subsiding of the pressure, the elastic<br>
effect of the element 11 ensure that the element 11 again returns to the curvature<br>
present in the pressure-less starting state. In this respect, the inside wall of the housing<br>
part 9 can be constructed, for example, slightly convex in the direction of the element 11<br>
or one or more stop elements can be provided on the inside wall of the housing part 9 or<br>
on the element 11 or on the sealing element 13.<br>
At this point, it should be noted that the sealing element can, of course, also be<br>
provided on the outside convex side of the element 11. In this case, it is also possible to<br>
use a loose sealing element, not connected to the element 11, for example, a separate,<br>
ring-shaped sealing disk made of rubber or plastic.<br>
The embodiment of a clamping and/or braking device shown in Figure 3 is<br>
similar to the embodiment in Figure 1. Instead of a single ring-shaped, plate-like<br>
element 11, five pairs of ring-shaped, plate-like elements 11, as a whole, are, however,<br>
provided in this embodiment. In this way, ten times the braking or clamping forces can<br>
be transferred to the object 17 with the same pressure of the pressure medium.<br><br>
The two ring-shaped, plate-like elements 11 of a pair are placed thereby<br>
in such a way that their concave sides oppose each other. In this way, a<br>
space sealed-off with respect to the pressure space 15, in which the<br>
elements 11 of the pairs of elements, sealed off with respect to each other, is formed, in<br>
a simple manner, between each pair of elements 11. With a pressurization of the<br>
pressure space 15 with the pressure of the pressure medium, the slit walls of<br><br><br>
the elements 11 are there to be bent toward one another. Since the inside ends 1 lb of the<br>
elements 11 of a pair move jointly, a sealing off of the space between the elements 1 can be<br>
reliably attained with simple means. The outside boundaries of the elements 11 can, of course,<br>
also be held, for the fixing, by suitable means in the housing 3, for example, in grooves in the<br>
circumferential wall of the cylindrical recess 7 of the first housing part 5. The two elements 11 of<br>
a pair can, of course, also be connected to one another-for example, they can be locked together.<br>
The embodiment of a clamping and/or braking device 1, according to Figure 4, differs<br>
from the embodiment shown in Figure 3 merely in that the inside ends 1 lb of the elements 11 do<br>
not apply pressure directly on the object 17 to be braked or to be clamped, but rather, via a ring-<br>
shaped pressurizable element 21, which is located inside the housing 3. The pressurizable<br>
element 21 is so deformed by the forces exerted by the pairs of ring-shaped, plate-like elements<br>
11 âin particular, the inside diameter of the pressurizable element 21 is reduced to such an extent<br>
that the forces are transferred, at least partially, to the object 17.<br>
This embodiment offers the advantage that the sealing off of the pressure space 15<br>
between the housing and the pressurizable element 21 can take placeâfor example, again via the<br>
sealing elements 19 in the form of O rings.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 5, in which another embodiment of a clamping and/or<br>
braking device is shown, it is also possible to provide a pressurizable element 21, constructed in<br>
an integrated manner with the housing 3, instead of a separate pressurizable element. In the case<br>
shown, the recess 7 in the first housing part 5 is designed in such a manner that a thin inside wall<br>
is formed, which forms the pressurizable element 21. The wall must be so thin that a sufficient<br>
deformation can be guaranteed when forces are exerted by the pairs of ring-shaped, plate-like<br>
elements 11 and thus a sufficient transfer of these forces to the object 17. The sealing off of the<br>
pressure space 15 can take place here in that the thin wall or the pressurizable element 21 is<br>
connected to the second housing part 9 in an essentially airtight manner. For the sealing, a sealing<br>
element 19, for example, in the form of an O ring, can again be used.<br>
Of course, such a clamping and/or braking device can also be designed in such a way that<br>
the corresponding forces are transferred to an object on a point-like, linear, or non-ring-shaped<br>
closed surface, for example, for the production of a clamping and/or braking device for a linear<br>
guide.<br>
If one does not interpret the representation in Figure 5 as an excerpt from an essentially<br>
rotation-symmetrical representation, but rather as an excerpt from a representation with a (for<br>
example, rectangular) housing 3, in which rectangular, plate-like elements 11 are placed, then a<br>
clamping and/or braking device is formed for the pressurization of the surface of an object 17, in<br><br>
which, for example, it may be a track of a linear guide. The housing 3 can, for example, be<br>
mounted on a carriage, not depicted in more detail, conducted by means of the object 17 designed<br>
as a track. The carriage can grip the track so that the exertion even of high forces on the surface<br>
of the object is possible, without lifting the carriage off the track. The mode of functioning of, for<br>
example, rectangular, plate-like elements can be deduced analogous to the preceding statements<br>
in connection with the annular, plate-like elements.<br>
If a pressurizable element 21 is not used with such an embodiment, then the plate-like<br>
elements 1 can be held, with their inside ends 1 la, in the housing or connected firmly with it (one<br>
piece or detachable). Of course, a sealing off of the pressure space 15, with respect to the object<br>
17, must then again take place. The lateral edges or areas of the rectangular, plate-like elements<br>
must also be sealed off to create a pressure space or a "pressure-less" space between the pairs of<br>
plate-like elements.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 6 is also a version of a clamping and/or braking<br>
device 1, with which a linear guide can be realized. The first housing part 5 is constructed, in this<br>
case, with an H-shaped cross section, wherein between the upper legs of the H, a pair of, for<br>
example, rectangular, plate-like elements 11 is provided. Since such elements 11 need not be<br>
provided with slits, it is possible, of course, to also dispense with corresponding sealing<br>
elements. The pressure space 15 is, in turn, formed outside the pair of the plate-like elements 11.<br>
In a pressurization of the pressure space 15, a deformation of the H-shaped housing part 5<br>
is produced, in particular, in the area of the middle crosslink of the H and the transition areas<br>
between the crosslink and the lateral legs of the H. In this way, the rigidly constructed, lower legs<br>
of the H are moved inwards in the direction of the intermediately placed object 17 and transfer<br>
corresponding braking or clamping forces to the object. In this respect, it is possible to provide<br>
clamping and/or brake shoes 23 on the insides of the lower legs of the H.<br>
If instead of an H-shaped housing part 5, a U-shaped housing is used, in which one or<br>
more (for example, rectangular) plate-like elements, are provided between the legs of the U, with<br>
these elements pressing the legs of the U toward the outside with a pressurization, then an "active<br>
loosening" of an object, for example, with a linear guide, can be realized. Of course, this can also<br>
be attained with an H-shaped housing in that the brake shoes are located on the outsides of the<br>
lower legs of the H and they apply pressure on the object, for example, in a groove. Conversely,<br>
an "active clamping or braking" can also be produced with a U-shaped housing, if the brake<br>
shoes are located on the outsides of the legs of the U and correspondingly apply pressure on the<br>
object.<br>
Finally, it should be pointed out that of course, individual features which are described in<br><br><br>
the preceding only in connection with a specific embodiment can also be combined, if<br>
reasonable, with other embodiments also.<br><br><br>
