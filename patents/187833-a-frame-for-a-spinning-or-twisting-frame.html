Frame for a spinning or twisting frame<br>
The invention relates to a frame for a spinning or twisting frame, which mainly consists of support beams parallel to the lengthwise direction of the frame and at right angle to it intermediate shields with guiding rods and a drafting system above the intermediate shields.<br>
The drafting system is supported by the intermediate shields. It can be supported on guiding rods which protrude into drillings of the intermediate shields. These guiding rods, besides their support function, are used to guide thread guides moving up and down in vertical direction within the frame.<br>
This type of construction saves material, however does not provide high accuracy because of the total tolerance accumulation of the parts put together. Furthermore the stability against deformation is not satisfactory.<br>
It is the object of the invention to eliminate the disadvantages of known constructions and to provide a cost saving, robust construction concept.<br>
The task as object of the invention is solved by resting the drafting system on the intermediate shields and by fastening the guiding rods on the sides of the shields. In a preferred embodiment of the intermediate shields said shields are provided with prisms with guiding surfaces, against which guiding rods are screwed, said rods running parallel to the prisms. The guiding rods, together with the intermediate shields form a particularly precise and stable support and guiding unit. The guiding rods for instance are used to guide support elements for thread guides or to guide ring<br><br>
rail carriers, which, by means of suitable driving means can be moved up and down in vertical direction. The intermediate parts are screwed together with support beams which, for instance, can carry cables, running in the lengthwise direction of the frame. Other supports serve as so called spindle benches as support means for spindles or as rails to guide servicing units. Supports within the lower part of the intermediate shield to guide additional drive elements of the spinning frame, can make up a unit together with the intermediate shields. To these supports the above mentioned rails for guiding servicing units are screwed. An intermediate shield is preferably manufactured as a one piece casting. All support surfaces for the support beams i.e. rails on the intermediate shields can be processed in one setting of the intermediate shields. Processing of the guiding surfaces on the prisms is also possible in the same setting. With this, an especially accurate position of all frame parts to each other, attached to one intermediate shield, results.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning or twisting<br>
frame comprising support beams, parallel to the lengthwise<br>
	.<br>
direction of frame and intermediate shields, characterised in that in the lower part of the intermediate shields is provided with a support Integral with the intermediate shields for guiding additional drive elements of the spinning frame.<br>
In the following the invention 1s explained more  closely<br>
according to the accompanying drawings.   Whereas 1s shown in :<br><br>
F1g. 1   as cross section through a spinning frame with a view of the intermediate shield	<br>
Fig. 2   a detail of figure 1 with the intermediate part and the<br><br>
guiding rods	<br>
Fig.  3        a -toil view onto the arrangement  in figure 2.<br><br>
The upper part of the spinning frame 10 is made up of the drafting system 11 according to figure 1, which by means of so called cylinder supports 12 rests on the intermediate shields 20. The function of the drafting system 11 is to draw roving with cylinder 14 and to deliver it to the spindles 44. The drafting system 11 rests on the support surface 28 of the intermediate shields 20, from which pins 30 protrude upwards through the cylinder benches 16 into the cylinder supports 12. The intermediate shield 20 is a plate reaching from the feet 62 of the frame up to the support surfaces 28 and being provided with ribs 22, said plate containing in the lower part supports 58 with drillings 60 to guide driving parts. A spinning frame 10 comprises at a certain distance several shields 20, which by means of supports like the spindle benches 46, U-profiles 48 and rails 50 are connected on both sides of the frame. The supports are screwed together with the intermediate shield 20, for instance the spindle bench 46 onto the support surface 29 and the rail 50 onto the support surface 59. Where possible, i.e. necessary, the intermediate shields 20 are provided with ribs 22 and openings, for instance an opening 23 through which a driving shaft for spindle 44 is running. Next to the spindles 44 there are, as part of the spinning process, various parts which are movably supported to guide the thread, such as the ring rail 36 with rings 38, thread guide 34 and 32 which is fastened onto ring rail supports 40 i.e. on supports for thread guide 42. The supports for the thread guide 42 and the ring rail support 40 can be moved upwards and downwards in the direction being indicated by arrows, by driving means 41, as indicated in figure 2, whereby the supports 40 i.e. 42 are guided by guiding rods 25 in vertical direction. The guiding rod 25 according to figure 2 rests in bushings 43 within the supports 40 i.e. 42. The guiding rods 25 are screwed<br><br>
together with the intermediate shields 20 via the prisms 24. Whereby the screws 27 press the guiding rod 25 against the wedge shaped guiding surfaces 28 in the prisms 24.<br>
The supports 48 in the lower part of the intermediate shield 20 can for instance be used to carry cables, whereby a cover 47 on the supports 48 is provided.<br><br><br>
