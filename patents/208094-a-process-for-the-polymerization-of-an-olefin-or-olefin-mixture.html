This invention relates to a class of Group 4 metal complexes and to polymerization catalysts derived therefrom that are particularly suitable for use in a polymerization process for preparing homopolymers and copolymers of olefins or diolefins, including copolymers comprising two or more olefins or diolefins such as copolymers comprising a monovinyl aromatic monomer and ethylene or copolymers comprising ethylene, propylene and a conjugated diene.<br>
Constrained geometry metal complexes and methods for their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Application Serial No. 545,403, filed July 3,1990 (EP-A-416,815). This publication also teaches the preparation of certain novel copolymers of ethylene and a hindered vinyl monomer, including monovinyl aromatic monomers, having a pseudo-random incorporation of the hindered vinyl monomer therein. Additional teachings of constrained geometry catalysts may be found in U.S. Application Serial No. 547,718, filed July 3, 1990 (EP-A-468,651); U.S. Application Serial No. 702,475, filed May 20,1991 (EP-A-514,828); U.S. Application Serial No. 876,268, filed May 1, 1992, (EP-A-520,732) and U.S. Application Serial No. 8,003, filed January 21, 1993 (WO93/19104), as well as US-A-5,055,438, US-A-5,057,475, US-A-5,096,867, US-A-5,064,802, US-A-5,132,380, US-A-5,470,993, WO95-00526, and US Provisional Application 60-005913. Variously substituted indenyl containing metal complexes have been taught in U.S. serial number 592,756, filed January 26,1996, as well as WO95/14024.<br>
According to the present invention there are provided metal complexes corresponding to the formula (I):<br><br>
where M is titanium, zirconium or hafnium in the +2, +3 or +4 formal oxidation state;<br>
R' and R" are independently each occurrence hydride, hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl, halide, hydrocarbytoxy, hydrocarbylsiloxy, hydrocarbylsilylamino, di(hydrocarbyl)amino, hydrocarbyleneamino, di(hydrocarbyl)phosphino, hydrocarbylene-phosphino, hydrocarbylsulfido, halo-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy-substituted hydrocarbyl, silyl-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylsiloxy-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylsilylamino-substituted hydrocarbyl, di(hydrocarbyl)amino-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyleneamino-<br><br>
substituted hydrocarbyl, di(hydrocarbyl)phosphino-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylene-phosphino-substituted hydrocarbyl, or hydrocarbylsulfido-substituted hydrocarbyl, said Ft' or R" group having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms, and optionally two or more of the foregoing groups may together form a divalent derivative;<br>
FT" is a divalent hydrocarbylene- or substituted hydrocarbylene group forming a fused system with the remainder of the metal complex, said R"' containing from 1 to 30 nonhydrogen atoms;<br>
Z is a divalent moiety, or a moiety comprising one a-bond and a neutral two electron pair able to form a coordinate-covalent bond to M, said Z comprising boron, or a member of Group 14 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, and also comprising nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur or oxygen;<br>
X is a monovalent anionic ligand group having up to 60 atoms exclusive of the class of ligands that are cyclic, delocalized, Tt-bound ligand groups;<br>
X' independently each occurrence is a neutral ligating compound having up to 20 atoms;<br>
X" is a divalent anionic ligand group having up to 60 atoms;<br>
p is zero, 1, 2, or 3;<br>
q is zero, 1 or 2, and<br>
r is zero or 1.<br>
'	The above complexes may exist as isolated crystals optionally in pure form or as a<br>
mixture with other complexes, in the form of a solvated adduct, optionally in a solvent, especially an organic liquid, as well as in the form of a dimer or chelated derivative thereof, wherein the chelating agent is an organic material such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).<br>
Also, according to the present invention, there is provided a catalyst for olefin polymerization comprising:<br>
A.	1) a metal complex of formula (I), and<br>
2) an activating cocatalyst,<br>
the molar ratio of 1) to 2) being from 1:10,000 to 100:1, or<br>
B.	the reaction product formed by converting a metal complex of formula (I) to an active<br>
catalyst by use of an activating technique.<br><br>
Further according to the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerization of olefins comprising contacting one or more C2-20 ct-olefins under polymerization conditions with a catalyst comprising:<br>
A.	1) a metal complex of formula (I), and<br>
2) an activating cocatalyst,<br>
the molar ratio of 1) to 2) being from 1:10,000 to 100:1, or<br>
B.	the reaction product formed by converting a metal complex of formula (I) to an active<br>
catalyst by use of an activating technique.<br>
Use of the present catalysts and processes results in the highly efficient production of high molecular weight olefin polymers over a wide range of polymerization conditions, and especially at elevated temperatures. They are especially useful for the formation of ethylene homopolymers, copolymers of ethylene and one or more a-olefins (i. e., olefins having greater than 3 carbon atoms), copolymers of ethylene, propylene and a diene (EPDM copolymers), copolymers of ethylene and styrene (ES polymers), copolymers of ethylene, styrene, and a diene (ESDM polymers), and copolymers of ethylene, propylene and styrene (EPS polymers). The use of the complexes, especially those wherein the metal is in the +2 formal oxidation state in continuous solution polymerizations surprisingly results in formation of polymers, especially EPDM terpolymers having extremely high molecular weights.<br>
The catalysts of this invention may also be supported on a support material and used in olefin polymerization processes in a slurry or in the gas phase. The catalyst may be prepolymerized with one or more olefin monomers in situ in a polymerization reactor or in a separate process with intermediate recovery of the prepolymerized catalyst prior to the primary polymerization process.<br>
The neutral diene complexes are prepared by contacting the corresponding complex in the +4 or +3 oxidation state with a neutral diene in the presence of a reducing agent, preferably a group 1 or 2 metal alkyl derivative having from 1 to 6 carbons in each alkyl group in an inert diluent. It has been found that the use of from 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents of the diene in the foregoing reaction gives improved yields and purity of the desired diene complex compared to the use of larger quantities of the diene. In addition, heating the reaction mixture prior to addition of the conjugated diene reactant, preferably to a temperature from 50 to 95 °C, gives a further improvement in yield and purity.<br>
All reference to the Periodic Table of the Elements herein shall refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements, published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 1995. Also, any reference to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the IUPAC system for numbering groups.<br><br>
Olefins as used herein are C2-10O 000 aliphatic or aromatic compounds containing<br>
vinylic unsaturation, as well as cyclic compounds such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene, and norbornene, including norbornene substituted in the 5 and 6 position with C-1-20 hydrocarbyl<br>
groups. Also included are mixtures of such olefins as well as mixtures of such olefins with C4.<br>
40 diolefin compounds. Examples of the latter compounds include ethylidenenorbornene, 1,4-<br>
hexadiene, and norbornadiene. Long chain vinyl terminated monomers may be formed during the polymerization process, for example by the phenomenon of (i-hydride elimination of a proton from a growing polymer chain. This process results in incorporation of extremely long chains into the resulting polymer, i. e. long chain branching. The catalysts and processes herein are especially suited for use in preparation of ethylene/propylene, ethylene/1-butene, ethylene/1 -hexene, ethylene/styrene, and ethylene/1 -octene copolymers as well as terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and a nonconjugated diene, referred to as EPDM polymers, terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and styrene, referred to as EPS polymers, or terpolymers of ethylene, styrene and a nonconjugated diene, referred to as ESDM polymers,.<br>
Monovinyl aromatic monomers for use herein include C3.20 arY' substituted ethylene compounds having the formula:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
R-j independently each occurrence is hydrogen or C-j.4 alkyl, and<br>
R2 independently each occurrence is R-j or halo.<br>
In the metal complexes, preferred X' groups are carbon monoxide; phosphines, especially trimethylphosphine, triethylphosphine, triphenylphosphine and bis(1,2-dimethylphosphino)ethane; P(OR)3, wherein R is C1-20hydrocarbyl; ethers, especially<br>
tetrahydrofuran; amines, especially pyridine, bipyridine, tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), and triethylamine; olefins; and neutral conjugated dienes having from 4 to 40 carbon atoms. Complexes including such neutral diene X' groups are those wherein the metal is in the +2 formal oxidation state.<br>
Preferred Rm groups are those corresponding to the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R' is as previously defined, most preferably hydrogen or methyl.<br>
Further in reference to the metal complexes, X preferably is selected from the group consisting of halo, hydrocarbyl, silyl, and N,N-dialkylamino substituted hydrocarbyl. The number of X groups depends on the oxidation state of M, whether Z is divalent or not and whether any neutral diene groups or divalent X" groups are present. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the quantity of the various substituents and the identity of Z are chosen to provide charge balance, thereby resulting in a neutral metal complex. For example, when Z is divalent, and r is zero, p is two less than the formal oxidation state of M. When Z contains one neutral two electron coordinate-covalent bonding site, and M is in a formal oxidation state of +3, p may equal zero and r equal 1, or p may equal 2 and r equal zero. In a final example, if M is in a formal oxidation state of +2, Z may be a divalent ligand group, p and r may both equal zero and one neutral ligand group may be present.<br>

The complexes can be prepared by use of well known synthetic techniques. Optionally a reducing agent can be employed to produce the lower oxidation state complexes. Such a process is disclosed in WO95-00526.. The syntheses are conducted in a suitable noninterfering solvent at a temperature from -100 to 300°C, preferably from -78 to 100°C, most preferably from 0 to 50°C. By the term "reducing agent" herein is meant a metal or compound which, under reducing conditions causes the metal M, to be reduced from a higher to a lower oxidation state. Examples of suitable metal reducing agents are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, aluminum and zinc, alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as sodium/mercury amalgam and sodium/potassium alloy. Examples of suitable reducing agent compounds are group 1 or 2 metal hydrocarbyl compounds having from 1 to 20 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, such as, sodium naphthalenide, potassium graphite, lithium alkyls, lithium or potassium alkadienyls; and Grignard reagents. Most preferred reducing agents are the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, especially lithium and magnesium metal.<br>
Suitable reaction media for the formation of the complexes include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and cyclic ethers, particularly branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; aromatic and hydrocarbyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, C-j.4 dialkyl ethers, C1.4 dialkyl ether<br>
derivatives of (poly)alkylene glycols, and tetrahydrofuran. Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br><br>
As previously mentioned, the diene complexes wherein the metal is in the +2 formal oxidation state can be conveniently prepared by reaction of the corresponding metal complex wherein the metal is in the +3 or +4 formal oxidation state, especially the dihalide complex, with the neutral diene in the presence of a reducing agent. In a preferred embodiment, it has been discovered that a large excess of diene reactant is detrimental to this reaction. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment there is provided a process for preparing a neutral diene complex corresponding to the formula:<br><br>
R' and R" are independently each occurrence hydride, hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl, halide, hydrocarbyloxy, hydrocarbylsiloxy, hydrocarbylsilylamino, di(hydrocarbyl)amino, hydrocarbyleneamino, di(hydrocarbyl)phosphino, hydrocarbylene-phosphino, hydrocarbylsulfido, halo-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy-substituted hydrocarbyl, silyl-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylsiloxy-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylsilylamino-substituted hydrocarbyl, di(hydrocarbyl)amino-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyleneamino-substituted hydrocarbyl, di(hydrocarbyl)phosphino-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylene-phosphino-substituted hydrocarbyl, or hydrocarbylsulfido-substituted hydrocarbyl, said R' or R" group having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms, and optionally two or more of the foregoing groups may together form a divalent derivative;<br>

r is zero or 1<br>
with from 1 to 2 equivalents of a neutral conjugated diene of the formula X' in an inert diluent in the presence of a reducing agent and recovering the resulting product.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the process, the reagents are contacted at an elevated temperature from 50 to 95 °C rather than first contacting the reagent sat a lower temperature and then raising the reaction temperature. More particularly, it is desirable to conduct the process under conditions wherein a reaction mixture comprising the metal complex and reducing agent is heated to a temperature from 50 to 95 °C prior to adding the conjugated diene.<br>

Suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion, A". As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the catalytic derivative derived therefrom, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon. Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially.<br>

The technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion. In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal complex catalytically inactive are not substantially formed during the reaction. More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are: liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0 to 100°C), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert. "Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis. It is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis. Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (all isomers), dimethoxyethane (DME), and mixtures thereof.<br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively). Suitable materials of construction for the cell are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal. The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive materials that are unaffected by the reaction mixture or reaction conditions. Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials. Normally an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the working electrode compartment and counter electrode compartment. The working electrode is immersed in a reaction medium comprising the metal complex to be activated, solvent, supporting electrolyte, and any other materials desired for moderating the electrolysis or stabilizing the resulting complex. The counter electrode is immersed in a mixture of the solvent and supporting electrolyte. The desired voltage may be determined by theoretical calculations or experimentally by sweeping the cell using a reference electrode such as a silver electrode immersed in the cell electrolyte. The background cell current, the current draw in the absence of the desired electrolysis, is also determined. The electrolysis is completed when the current drops from the desired level to the background level. In this manner, complete conversion of the initial metal complex can be easily detected.<br><br>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and a compatible, noncoordinating anion, A-. Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts corresponding to the formula G+A"; wherein:<br>
G+ is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex, and<br>
A' is as previously defined.<br>
Examples of cations, G+, include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms. Preferred cations are the tetra(n-butylammonium)- and tetraethylammonium- cations.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A- migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product. Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode. Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of tetrakis(perfluoroaryl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or perfluoroaryl group, especially tetra(n-butylammonium)tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
A further recently discovered electrochemical technique for generation of activating cocatalysts is the electrolysis of a disilane compound in the presence of a source of a noncoordinating compatible anion. This technique is more fully disclosed and claimed in the previously mentioned United States Patent application serial number 304,314, published in eqauivalent form as WO96/08519.<br>
The foregoing electrochemical activating technique and activating cocatalysts may also be used in combination. An especially preferred combination is a mixture of a tri(hydrocarbyl)aluminum ortri(hydrocarbyl)borane compound having from 1 to 4 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group with an oligomeric or polymeric alumoxane compound.<br>
The molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1000 to 1:1. Alumoxane, when used by itself as an activating cocatalyst, is employed in large quantity, generally at least 100 times the quantity of metal complex on a molar basis. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, where used as an activating cocatalyst is employed in a molar ratio to the metal complex of form 0.5:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 6:1 most preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. The remaining activating cocatalysts are generally employed in approximately equimolar quantity with the metal complex.<br><br>
The catalysts, whether or not supported in any of the foregoing methods, may be used to polymerize ethylenically and/or acetylenically unsaturated monomers having from 2 to 100,000 carbon atoms either alone or in combination. Preferred monomers include the C2-20<br>
a-olefins especially ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, long chain macromolecular a-olefins, and mixtures thereof. Other preferred monomers include styrene, C-|_4 alkyl substituted styrene,<br>
tetrafluoroethylene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, ethylidenenorbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, vinylcyclohexane, 4-vinylcyclohexene, divinylbenzene, and mixtures thereof with ethylene. Long chain macromolecular a-olefins are vinyl terminated polymeric remnants formed in situ during continuous solution polymerization reactions. Under suitable processing conditions such long chain macromolecular units are readily polymerized into the polymer product along with ethylene and other short chain olefin monomers to give small quantities of long chain branching in the resulting polymer.<br>
Preferred monomers include a combination of ethylene and one or more comonomers selected from monovinyl aromatic monomers, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclohexane, norbornadiene, ethylidene-norbornene, C3_-|o aliphatic a-olefins (especially propylene,<br>
isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene), and C4.40 dienes. Most preferred monomers are mixtures of ethylene and styrene; mixtures of<br>
ethylene, propylene and styrene; mixtures of ethylene, styrene and a nonconjugated diene, especially ethylidenenorbornene or 1,4-hexadiene, and mixtures of ethylene, propylene and a nonconjugated diene, especially ethylidenenorbornene or 1,4-hexadiene.<br>
In general, the polymerization may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions, that is, temperatures from 0-250°C, preferably 30 to 200°C and pressures from atmospheric to 10,000 atmospheres. Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase, solid state powder polymerization or other process condition may be employed if desired. A support, especially silica, alumina, or a polymer (especially poly(tetrafluoroethylene) or a polyolefin) may be employed, and desirably is employed when the catalysts are used in a gas phase polymerization process. The support is preferably employed in an amount to provide a weight ratio of catalyst (based on metal):support from 1:100,000 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:50,000 to 1:20, and most preferably from 1:10,000 to 1:30.<br>
In most polymerization reactions the molar ratio of catalyst:polymerizable compounds employed is from 10"12:1 to 10"1:1, more preferably from 10"9:1 to 10'5:1.<br>
Suitable solvents use for solution polymerization are inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane,<br><br>
cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C^Q alkanes, and alkyl-substituted aromatic<br>
compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers.<br>
The catalysts may be utilized in combination with at least one additional homogeneous or heterogeneous polymerization catalyst in the same reactor or in separate reactors connected in series or in parallel to prepare polymer blends having desirable properties. An example of such a process is disclosed in WO 94/00500..<br>
Utilizing the present catalysts, a-olefin homopolymers and copolymers having densities from 0.85 g/cm3 to 0.96 g/cm3, and melt flow rates from 0.001 to 1000.0 dg/min are readily attained in a highly efficient process.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention are particularly advantageous for the production of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having high levels of long chain branching. The use of the catalysts of the present invention in continuous polymerization processes, especially continuous, solution polymerization processes, allows for elevated reactor temperatures which favor the formation of vinyl terminated polymer chains that may be incorporated into a growing polymer, thereby giving a long chain branch. The use of the present catalyst compositions advantageously allows for the economical production of ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having processability similar to high pressure, free radical produced low density polyethylene.<br>
The present catalyst compositions may be advantageously employed to prepare olefin polymers having improved processing properties by polymerizing ethylene alone or ethylene/a-olefin mixtures with low levels of a "H" branch inducing diene, such as norbomadiene, 1,7-octadiene, or 1,9-decadiene. The unique combination of elevated reactor temperatures, high molecular weight (or low melt indices) at high reactor temperatures and high comonomer reactivity advantageously allows for the economical production of polymers having excellent physical properties and processability. Preferably such polymers comprise ethylene, a C3.20<br>
a-olefin and a "H"-branching comonomer. Preferably, such polymers are produced in a solution process, most preferably a continuous solution process.<br>
The catalyst composition may be prepared as a homogeneous catalyst by addition of the requisite components to a solvent in which polymerization will be carried out by solution polymerization procedures. The catalyst composition may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing the requisite components on an inert inorganic or organic particulated solid. Examples of such solids include, silica, silica gel, alumina, trialkylaluminum compounds, and organic or inorganic polymeric materials, especially<br><br>
polyolefins. In an preferred embodiment, a heterogeneous catalyst is prepared by co-precipitating the metal complex, an inert, inorganic compound and an activator, especially an ammonium salt of a hydroxyaryl(trispentafluorophenyl)borate, such as an ammonium salt of (4-hydroxy-3,5-ditertiarybutylphenyl)(trispentafluorophenylborate. A preferred inert, inorganic compound for use in this embodiment is a tri (C1-4 alkyl) aluminum compound.<br>
When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, the catalyst composition is employed in a slurry or gas phase polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 carbon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Likewise the a-olefin monomer or a mixture of different a-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Most preferably at least a major part of the diluent comprises the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as the recovered catalyst components must be protected from oxygen and moisture. Therefore, the catalyst components and catalysts must be prepared and recovered in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere. Preferably, therefore, the reactions are performed in the presence of an dry, inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
The polymerization may be carried out as a batchwise or a continuous polymerization process A continuous process is preferred, in which event catalyst, ethylene, comonomer, and optionally solvent are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed therefrom.<br>
Without limiting in any way the scope of the invention, one means for carrying out such a polymerization process is as follows: In a stirred-tank reactor, the monomers to be polymerized are introduced continuously together with solvent and an optional chain transfer agent. The reactor contains a liquid phase composed substantially of monomers together with any solvent or additional diluent and dissolved polymer. If desired, a small amount of a "H"-branch inducing diene such as norbomadiene, 1,7-octadiene or 1,9-decadiene may also be added. Catalyst and cocatalyst are continuously introduced in the reactor liquid phase. The reactor temperature and pressure may be controlled by adjusting the solvent/monomer ratio, the catalyst addition rate, as well as by cooling or heating coils, jackets or both. The polymerization rate is controlled by the rate of catalyst addition. The ethylene content of the polymer product is determined by the ratio of ethylene to comonomer in the reactor, which is controlled by manipulating the respective feed rates of these components to the reactor. The polymer product molecular weight is controlled, optionally, by controlling other polymerization variables such as the temperature, monomer concentration, or by the previously mention chain<br><br>
transfer agent, such as a stream of hydrogen introduced to the reactor, as is well known in the art. The reactor effluent is contacted with a catalyst kill agent such as water. The polymer solution is optionally heated, and the polymer product is recovered by flashing off gaseous monomers as well as residual solvent or diluent at reduced pressure, and, if necessary, conducting further devolatilization in equipment such as a devolatilizing extruder. In a continuous process the mean residence time of the catalyst and polymer in the reactor generally is from 5 minutes to 8 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours. By using a catalyst that incorporates large amounts of hindered monovinyl monomer, hindered monovinyl homopolymer formed from residual quantities of the monomer are substantially reduced<br>
The process of the present invention can be employed to advantage in the gas phase copolymerization of olefins. Gas phase processes for the polymerization of olefins, especially the homopolymerization and copolymerization of ethylene and propylene, and the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a-olefins such as, for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene are well known in the art. In such processes, cooling of the reactor may be provided by the use of recycle gas, which is fed as a volatile liquid to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect. The volatile liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volatile inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having 3 to 8, preferably 4 to 6, carbon atoms. In the case that the monomer or comonomer itself is a volatile liquid (or can be condensed to provide such a liquid) this can be fed to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect. Examples of olefin monomers which can be employed in this manner are olefins containing three to eight, preferably three to six carbon atoms. The volatile liquid evaporates in the hot fluidized bed to form gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas. If the volatile liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerization in the bed. The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop. The recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will condense from the gas. This liquid is desirably recycled continuously to the fluidized bed. It is possible to recycle the condensed liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried in the recycle gas stream. This type of process is described, for example in EP 89691; U.S. 4,543,399; WO 94/25495 and U.S. 5,352,749. A particularly preferred method of recycling the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid directly into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed. This type of process is described in BP Chemicals' WO 94/28032.<br>
The polymerization reaction occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the continuous or semi-continuous addition of catalyst. Such catalyst can be supported on an inorganic or organic support material as described above.<br><br>
The polymer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by catalyzed copolymerization of the monomer and one or more comonomers on the fluidized particles of catalyst, supported catalyst or prepolymer within the bed. Start-up of the polymerization reaction is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer particles, which are preferably similar to the target polyolefin, and conditioning the bed according to techniques that are well known in the art. Such processes are used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polypropylene.<br>
The gas phase process employed can be, for example, of the type which employs a mechanically stirred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction zone. Preferred is the process wherein the polymerization reaction is carried out in a vertical cylindrical polymerization reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer particles supported above a perforated plate, the fluidization grid, by a flow of fluidization gas.<br>
The gas employed to fluidize the bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reaction from the bed. The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilization zone, also known as a velocity reduction zone, having a larger cross-sectional area than the fluidized bed and wherein fine particles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed. It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine particles from the hot gas stream. The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerization. The produced polymer is discharged continuously or discontinuously from the fluidized bed as desired.<br>
The gas phase processes suitable for the practice of this invention are preferably continuous processes which provide for the continuous supply of reactants to the reaction zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reaction zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reaction zone of the reactor.<br>
Typically, the fluidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at temperatures greater than 50°C, preferably from 60°C to 110°C, more preferably from 70°C to 110°C.<br>
Typically the molar ratio of comonomer to monomer used in the polymerization depends upon the desired density for the composition being produced and is 0.5 or less. Desirably, when producing materials with a density range of from 0.91 to 0.93 the comonomer to monomer ratio is less than 0.2, preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02, and may even be less than 0.01. Typically, the ratio of hydrogen to monomer is less than 0.5, preferably less than 0.2, more preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02 and may even be less than 0.01.<br><br>
The above-described ranges of process variables are appropriate for the gas phase process of this invention and may be suitable for other processes adaptable to the practice of this invention.<br>

the reactor, quenched with isopropyl alcohol and a hindered phenol antioxidant (Irganox™ 1010 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) is added to the resulting solution. Polymers formed are dried in a vacuum oven set at 135°C for 20 hours. Results using the catalysts of the invention are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
ethvlene/1 -octene copolvmeriztion<br>
A stirred 3.8 liter reactor was charged with 1440 g of Isopar-E™ mixed alkanes solvent (available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.) and 126 g of 1-octene comonomer. Hydrogen was added as a molecular weight control agent by differential pressure expansion from a 75 mL addition tank at 25 psid (2070 kPa). The reactor was heated to the polymerization temperature of 130 QC and saturated with ethylene at 450 psig (3.1 MPa). Approximately 2.0 \imo\ each of catalyst and trispentafluorophenylborane cocatalyst as 0.005 M solutions in toluene were premixed in a drybox, transferred to a catalyst addition tank and injected into the reactor over approximately a four minute period. The polymerization conditions were maintained for 10 minutes with ethylene on demand. The resulting solution was removed from the reactor, and a hindered phenol antioxidant (Irganox™ 1010 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) was added to the resulting solution. Polymers formed were dried in a vacuum oven set at 120 QC for 20 hours. Results are contained in Table 2.<br><br>
Ethylene/1-Octene Copolvmerizations<br>
A 2.0 liter Parr reactor is charged with approximately 740 g of Isopar-E™ mixed alkanes solvent (available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.) and 118 g of 1-octene comonomer. Hydrogen was added as a molecular weight control agent by differential pressure expansion from a 75 mL addition tank at 25 psid (2070 kPa). The reactor was heated to the polymerization temperature of 140°C and saturated with ethylene at 500 psig. Then 0.5 jimol each of catalyst<br><br>
and B(C6F5)3 cocatalyst as 0.005 M solutions in toluene were premixed in a drybox, transferred to a catalyst addition tank, and injected into the reactor. The polymerization conditions were maintained for 15 minutes with ethylene on demand. The resulting solution was removed from the reactor, and a hindered phenol antioxidant (67 mg of Irganox™ 1010 + 133 mg of Irgafos™ 168 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) was added to the resulting solution. Polymers formed were dried in a vacuum oven set at 140°C for 20 hours. Results are contained in Table 3<br><br>
Continuous Solution Copolvmerization<br>
Ethylene, propylene, and ethylidene norbornene (EPDM) terpolymer compositions are prepared using in a 23 L stirred, oil jacketed, autoclave reactor designed for continuous addition of reactants and continuous removal of polymer solution, devolatilization and polymer recovery, operating at 475 psig (3.3 MPa) pressure and 90 °C temperature. In Runs 11 and 12 the metal complex used was prepared according to Example 1. In Run 14 the metal complex used was a comparative complex, (t-<br>
butylamido)dimethyl(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)silanetitanium 1,3-pentadiene. Ethylene flows for all polymerizations was 1.1 kg/h. Propylene flows for all polymerizations was 1.6 kg/h. Hydrogen, added as a molecular weight control agent was added at a flow rate of 26 scc/min. The cocatalyst for all polymerizations was a combination of trispentafluorophenyl-borane (FAB) and modified methylalumoxane (MMAO available from Akzo Nobel). In the process, ethylene, propylene, and hydrogen were combined into a single stream before being introduced into a diluent mixture comprising a mixed alkane solvent (Isopar-E™, available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.) and ethylidene norbornene (ENB) to form a combined feed mixture that was continuously injected into the reactor. The metal complex and the cocatalyst mixture were similarly combined in the same diluent and also continuously injected into the reactor.<br>
The reactor exit stream was continuously removed from the reactor, injected with catalyst kill (water) and hindered bisphenol antioxidant, and introduced into a separator, where molten polymer was continuously separated from the unreacted monomers, hydrogen, and diluent. The molten polymer was fed to an extruder, formed into strands, cooled, pelletized and<br><br>
collected for analysis. Details of processing conditions and polymer properties are contained in Table 4.<br><br>
The resulting polymers not only have significantly increased Mooney viscosity compared to the control, thereby indicating increased molecular weight, especially for run 13 using a titanium catalyst wherein the metal is in the +2 formal oxidation state, but the catalyst and cocatalyst efficiencies for the catalysts of the invention in preparing such polymers under essentially equivalent process rates and condtions were significantly improved.<br><br><br><br><br>
