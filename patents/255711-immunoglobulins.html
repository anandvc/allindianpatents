Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to immunoglobulins, particularly antibodies<br>
that bind to NOGO and neutralise the activity thereof, polynucleotides encoding<br>
such antibodies, pharmaceutical formulations containing said antibodies and to<br>
the use of such antibodies in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of neurological<br>
diseases. Other aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the description below.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in the Western World.<br>
There is no approved therapy for the treatment of stroke other than tissue<br>
plasminogen (t-PA) which has to be administered within 3 hours of onset<br>
following a computer tomography (CT) scan to exclude haemorrhage. To date<br>
most therapeutic agents directed towards the treatment of acute stroke (i.e.<br>
neuroprotection), have predominantly involved targeting glutamate receptors and<br>
their down stream signalling pathways known to be involved in acute cell death.<br>
However to date these strategies have proved unsuccessful in clinical trials and<br>
are often associated with dose-limiting side effects (Hill &amp; Hachinski, The Lancet,<br>
352 : (suppl III) 10-14 (1998)). Therefore there is a need for novel approaches<br>
directed towards the amelioration of cell death following the cessation of blood<br>
flow. Neuroprotection is the ability of a treatment to prevent or ameliorate<br>
neuronal cell loss in response to an insult or disease process. This may be<br>
achieved by targeting the neurons directly or indirectly by preventing glial<br>
(including oligodendrocyte) cell loss.<br>
Following the onset of stroke, some degree of spontaneous functional<br>
recovery is observed in many patients, suggesting that the brain has the (albeit<br>
limited) ability to repair and/or remodel following injury. Agents that have the<br>
potential to enhance this recovery may therefore allow intervention to be made<br>
much later (potentially days) following the onset of cerebral ischaemia. Agents<br>
which are able to offer both acute neuroprotection and enhance functional<br><br>
recovery may provide significant advantages over current potential<br>
neuroprotective strategies.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the presence of two<br>
diagnostic features of pathology. These are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary<br>
tangles composed of aggregated beta-amyloid peptide (A4O and A42) and<br>
hyperphosphorylated tau respectively (Dawbarn &amp; Allen 2001 Neurobiology of<br>
Alzheimer's Disease OUP).<br>
A comprehensive study has shown a strong link in patients between beta-<br>
amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline (Naslund et al, JAMA, March 22/29,<br>
2000, Vol.283, No;12, page 1571-1577). This is consistent with genetic and<br>
epidemiological studies that suggest that some mutations in APP and presenilin<br>
genes can predispose to early onset AD, which mutations also enhance the<br>
levels of Ap40 and Ap42 peptide, including the ratio thereof.<br>
Cleavage of the type I transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by<br>
two distinct proteases designated beta- and gamma-secretase is necessary for<br>
the formation of beta-amyloid peptide. The molecular identity of beta-secretase<br>
as the aspartyl-protease Asp2/BACE1 has been confirmed (Hussain et al<br>
Mol.Cell.NeuroSci. 16, 609-619 (2000); Vassar et al, Science (1999), Oct.22; 286<br>
(5440):735-741). The nature of gamma-secretase remains the source of some<br>
debate and is likely to consist of a high molecular weight complex consisting of at<br>
least the following proteins: presenilins, Aph1, Pen2 and nicastrin (reviewed in<br>
Medina &amp; Dotti Cell Signalling 2003 15(9):829-41).<br>
The processing of APP within the CNS is likely to occur within a number of<br>
cell-types including neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. While<br>
the overall rate of APP processing in these cells will be influenced by the relative<br>
level of expression of APP, BACE1/Asp2, presenilin-1 and -2, Aph1, Pen2 and<br>
nicastrin.<br>
Furthermore, additional factors regulating the subcellular location of APP<br>
can also influence its processing as shown by the finding that mutation of the<br>
YENP motif in the APP cytoplasmic domain which blocks its endocytosis reduces<br>
beta-amyloid production (Perez et al 1999 J Biol Chem 274 (27) 18851-6).<br>
Retention of the APP-beta-CTF in the ER by the addition of the KKQN retention<br>
motif is sufficient to reduce amyloid production in transfected cells (Maltese et al<br><br>
2001 J Biol Chem 276 (23) 20267-20279). Conversely, elevation of endocytosis,<br>
by overexpression of Rab5 is sufficient to elevate amyloid secretion from<br>
transfected cells (Grbovic et al 2003 J Biol Chem 278 (33) 31261-31268).<br>
Consistent with these findings further studies have shown that reduction of<br>
cellular cholesterol levels (a well known risk factor for AD) reduced beta-amyloid<br>
formation. This change was dependent on altered endocytosis as demonstrated<br>
by the use of the dominant negative dynamin mutants (K44A) and<br>
overexpression of the Rab5 GTPase activating protein RN-Tre (Ehehalt et al<br>
2003 J Cell Biol 160 (1) 113-123).<br>
Cholesterol rich microdomains or rafts are also an important cellular site of<br>
beta-amyloid production and APP, BACE1 and components of the gamma-<br>
secretase complex have all been shown to transiently reside within rafts.<br>
Antibody cross-linking of APP and BACE1 towards cholesterol rich rafts was able<br>
to elevate beta-amyloid production (Ehehalt et al 2003 J Cell Biol 160 (1) 113-<br>
123). Expression of GPI-anchored BACE1, which is exclusively targeted to lipid<br>
rafts, is similarly able to elevate APP cleavage and beta-amyloid production<br>
(Cordy et al 2003 PNAS 100(20) 11735-11740).<br>
The mechanisms underlying functional recovery after a stroke or other<br>
neurodamaging event or disease, are currently unknown. The sprouting of<br>
injured or non-injured axons has been proposed as one possible mechanism.<br>
However, although in vivo studies have shown that treatment of spinal cord injury<br>
or stroke with neurotrophic factors results in enhanced functional recovery and a<br>
degree of axonal sprouting, these do not prove a direct link between the degree<br>
of axonal sprouting and extent of functional recovery (Jakeman, et al. 1998, Exp.<br>
Neurol. 154: 170-184, Kawamata et al. 1997, Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA.,<br>
94:8179-8184, Ribotta, et al. 2000, J Neurosci. 20: 5144-5152). Furthermore,<br>
axonal sprouting requires a viable neuron. In diseases such as stroke which is<br>
associated with extensive cell death, enhancement of functional recovery offered<br>
by a given agent post stroke may therefore be through mechanisms other than<br>
axonal sprouting such as differentiation of endogenous stem cells, activation of<br>
redundant pathways, changes in receptor distribution or excitability of neurons or<br>
glia (Fawcett &amp; Asher, 1999, Brain Res. Bulletin, 49: 377-391, Homer &amp; Gage,<br>
2000, Nature 407 963-970).<br><br>
The limited ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to repair following<br>
injury is thought in part to be due to molecules within the CNS environment that<br>
have an inhibitory effect on axonal sprouting (neurite outgrowth). CNS myelin is<br>
thought to contain inhibitory molecules (Schwab ME and Caroni P (1988) J.<br>
Neurosci. 8, 2381-2193). Two myelin proteins, myelin-associated glycoprotein<br>
(MAG) and NOGO have been cloned and identified as putative inhibitors of<br>
neurite outgrowth (Sato S. et al (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.163,1473-<br>
1480; McKerracher L et al (1994) Neuron 13, 805-811; Mukhopadhyay G et al<br>
(1994) Neuron 13, 757-767; Torigoe K and Lundborg G (1997) Exp. Neurology<br>
150, 254-262; Schaferetal (1996) Neuron 16, 1107-1113; WO9522344;<br>
WO9701352; Prinjha R et al (2000) Nature 403, 383-384; Chen MS et al (2000)<br>
Nature 403,434-439; GrandPre T et al (2000) Nature 403, 439-444;<br>
US005250414A; WO200005364A1; WO0031235).<br>
Three forms of human NOGO have been identified: NOGO-A having 1192<br>
amino acid residues (GenBank accession no. AJ251383); NOGO-B, a splice<br>
variant which lacks residues 186 to 1004 in the putative extracellular domain<br>
(GenBank accession no. AJ251384) and a shorter splice variant, NOGO-C,<br>
which also lacks residues 186 to 1004 and also has smaller, alternative amino<br>
terminal domain (GenBank accession no. AJ251385) (Prinjha et al (2000) supra).<br>
Inhibition of the CNS inhibitory proteins such as NOGO may provide a<br>
therapeutic means to ameliorate neuronal damage and promote neuronal repair<br>
and growth thereby potentially assisting recovery from neuronal injury such as<br>
that sustained in stroke. Examples of such NOGO inhibitors may include small<br>
molecules, peptides and antibodies.<br>
It has been reported that a murine monoclonal antibody, IN-1, that was<br>
raised against NI-220/250, a myelin protein which is a potent inhibitor of neurite<br>
growth (and subsequently shown to be fragment of NOGO-A), promotes axonal<br>
regeneration (Caroni, P and Schwab, ME (1988) Neuron 1 85-96; Schnell, L and<br>
Schwab, ME (1990) Nature 343 269-272; Bregman, BS et al (1995) Nature 378<br>
498-501 and Thallmair, M et al (1998) Nature Neuroscience 1 124-131). It has<br>
also been reported that NOGO-A is the antigen for IN-1 (Chen et al (2000)<br>
Nature 403 434-439). Administration of IN-1 Fab fragment or humanised IN-1 to<br>
rats that have undergone spinal cord transection, enhanced recovery (Fiedler, M<br><br>
et al (2002) Protein Eng 15 931-941; Brosamle, C et al (2000) J. Neuroscience<br>
20 8061-8068).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies which bind to NOGO are described in WO<br>
04/052932 and WO2005028508. WO 04/052932 discloses a murine antibody<br>
11C7 which binds to certain forms of human NOGO with high affinity.<br>
Patent application WO05/061544 also discloses high affinity monoclonal<br>
antibodies, including a murine monoclonal antibody 2A10, and generally<br>
discloses humanised variants thereof, for example H1L11 (the sequences for the<br>
H1 and L11 are provided in SEQ ID NOs. 33 and 34 respectively (VH or VL<br>
sequences only)). The antibodies disclosed bind to human NOGO-A with high<br>
affinity. The murine 2A10 antibody (and CDR-grafted humanised variants thereof)<br>
are characterised by the following complementarity determining region (CDR)<br>
sequences (as determined using the Kabat methodology (Kabat et al. (1991)<br>
"Sequences of proteins of immunological interest"; Fifth Edition; US Department<br>
of Health and Human Services; NIH publication No 91-3242)) within their light<br>
and heavy chain variable regions:<br><br>
WO05/061544 further discloses "analogues" of the antibodies that<br>
comprise the CDRs of Tables 1 and 2 above, such "analogues" the have same<br><br>
antigen binding specificity and/or neutralizing ability as the donor antibody from<br>
which they were derived.<br>
Despite the art providing high affinity anti-NOGO antibodies, it remains a<br>
highly desirable goal to isolate and develop alternative, or improved,<br>
therapeutically useful monoclonal antibodies that bind and inhibit the activity of<br>
human NOGO.<br>
The process of neurodegeneration underlies many neurological<br>
diseases/disorders including, but not limited to, acute diseases such as stroke<br>
(ischemic or haemorrhagic), traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury as well<br>
as chronic diseases including Alzheimer's disease, frontp-temporal dementias<br>
(tauopathies), peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob<br>
disease (CJD), Schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple<br>
sclerosis, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and inclusion body myositis.<br>
Consequently the anti-NOGO monoclonal antibodies, and the like, of the present<br>
invention may be useful in the treatment of these diseases/disorders. Antibodies<br>
for the treatment of the above mentioned disease/disorders are provided by the<br>
present invention and described in detail below.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides specific heavy chain variable regions, and<br>
antibodies or fragments thereof comprising the said specific heavy chain variable<br>
regions and a light chain variable region that allows, when paired with the heavy<br>
chain variable regions, the Fv dimer to bind human NOGO-A with high affinity,<br>
and thereby neutralise the activity of human NOGO-A.<br>
The heavy chain variable regions of the present invention may be<br>
formatted, together with light chain variable regions to allow binding to human<br>
NOGO-A, in the conventional immunoglobulin manner (for example, human IgG,<br>
IgA, IgM etc.) or in any other fragment thereof or "antibody-like" format that binds<br>
to human NOGO-A (for example, single chain Fv, diabodies, Tandabs™ etc (for<br>
a summary of alternative "antibody" formats see Holliger and Hudson, Nature<br>
Biotechnology, 2005, Vol 23, No. 9,1126-1136)).<br>
A heavy chain variable region comprising a third CDR consisting<br>
essentially of the amino acid residues GQGY wherein the CDR contains at least<br><br>
one substitution within the GQGY core sequence, the substitutions being<br>
selected from the following substitutions: where the G in the first position is<br>
replaced by R, I, W or M; the Q in the second position is replaced by D, I, A, L, V<br>
or S; the G in the third position is replaced by W, N, Y, S, L or F; and the Y Fn the<br>
fourth position is replaced by W.<br>
In another embodiment, the third heavy chain CDR (CDR H3) only<br>
contains one substitutions to yield the following CDR H3: RQGY (SEQ ID<br>
NO.75), IQGY (SEQ ID NO.76), MQGY (SEQ ID NO.45), GDGY (SEQ ID<br>
NO.77), GIGY (SEQ ID NO.78), GSGY (SEQ ID NO.79), GQNY (SEQ ID NO.80),<br>
GQYY (SEQ ID NO.81), GQSY (SEQ ID NO.62), GQLY (SEQ ID NO.82), GQFY<br>
(SEQ ID NO.83), GQGW (SEQ ID NO.84), WQGY(SEQ ID NO.86), GAGY(SEQ<br>
ID NO.87), GLGY(SEQ ID NO.88), GVGY(SEQ ID NO.89), GQWY(SEQ ID<br>
NO.90).<br>
In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable regions above further<br>
contain the other CDRs listed in Table 2, i.e. CDR H1 (SEQ ID NO. 1) and CDR<br>
H2 (SEQ ID NO.2).<br>
The antibodies of the present invention, or fragments thereof, retain<br>
the human NOGO binding activity of antibodies that comprise the CDR H3:<br>
GQGY, in terms of their activity as measured in ELISA and Biacore experiments,<br>
and in some cases the activity in these experiments is increased.<br>
Human or humanised heavy chain variable regions containing G95M (substitution<br>
numbering by Kabat)<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the heavy chain variable<br>
regions of the present invention comprise the CDRs defined in Table 3 (as<br>
defined by Kabat):<br>
Table 3:<br><br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a human or<br>
humanised heavy chain variable region comprising each of the CDRs listed in<br>
Table 3. In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a<br>
humanised heavy chain variable region comprising the CDRs listed in Table 3<br>
within the larger sequence of a human heavy chain variable region. In yet<br>
another embodiment the humanised heavy chain variable region comprises the<br>
CDRs listed in Table 3 within an acceptor antibody framework having greater<br>
than 40% identity in the framework regions, or greater than 50%, or greater than<br>
60%, or greater than 65% identity to the murine 2A10 donor antibody heavy<br>
chain variable region (SEQ ID NO.7).<br>
When the CDRs of Table 3 are all used, in one embodiment the heavy<br>
chain variable region sequence is sequence H98 provided as SEQ ID NO. 66<br>
(H98 VH is the equivalent of H1 VH (SEQ ID NO.33) differing only in that the<br>
CDR H3 is MQGY in H98 instead of GQGY as found in H1).<br>
In one aspect of the present invention the antibodies comprise a heavy<br>
chain variable region having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 66 (H98<br>
variable region) further comprising a number of substitutions at one or more of<br>
positions 38, 40,48, 67, 68, 70, 72,74, and 79; wherein each substituted amino<br>
acid residue is replaced with the amino acid residue at the equivalent position in<br>
SEQ ID NO 7 (the heavy chain variable region of the donor antibody 2A10) and<br>
the number of substitutions is between 1 and 9. In other embodiments the<br>
number of substitutions is 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 8 or 9.<br>
In this context the substitutions that are described are equivalent in<br>
concept to "back-mutations" where the human framework amino acid residues in<br>
specific positions within the H98 sequence are back-mutated to the amino acid<br>
residues in the equivalent position within the 2A10 donor antibody sequence.<br>
Unless specifically stated otherwise to the contrary herein, when a<br>
numerical position of an amino acid residue found within a specific sequence is<br>
mentioned in this document, for example "position 12", it is intended that the<br>
skilled reader assigns the first amino acid in the sequence the position "1" and<br>
counts from position one and identifies the amino acid which is in the desired<br>
position, in this example the twelfth amino acid residue in the sequence. The<br>
skilled reader will notice that this numbering system does not correspond with the<br><br>
Kabat numbering system which is often used to define amino acid positions<br>
within antibody sequences.<br>
For optimal binding affinity, it was found for the humanisation of the mouse<br>
antibody 2A10 (the VH for which is SEQ ID NO. 7) that the pair of amino acid<br>
residues in positions 48 and 68, should be I and A respectively (as they exist in<br>
2A10) or M and V respectively (as they exist in H98). It is expected that the<br>
above finding is also of relevance to the humanisation of the G95M variant of<br>
2A10.<br>
The following table includes details of three different heavy chain variable<br>
(VH) regions which may form part of the antibodies of the present invention. Each<br>
of the disclosed VH is based on the H98 VH (SEQ ID NO. 66) further comprising<br>
the substitutions mentioned in the table (Table 4) where the H98 residue at the<br>
relevant position is substituted with the 2A10 residue at that position (in the table,<br>
"-" means that there is no substitution in that position, and so the residue remains<br>
as in the sequence of H98):<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, therefore, the heavy chain<br>
variable regions (VH) of the present invention are H26 VH (SEQ ID NO. 47), H27<br>
VH (SEQ ID NO. 48) and H28 VH (SEQ ID NO. 49)<br><br><br><br>
Human or Humanised heavy chain variable regions including G101S (substitution<br>
numbering by Kabat)<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a human<br>
or humanised heavy chain variable region which comprises CDRs defined in<br>
Table 5:<br><br>
In one embodiment the CDRs of Table 5 are incorporated within a human<br>
heavy chain variable region sequence. In another embodiment the humanised<br>
heavy chain variable region comprises the CDRs listed in Table 5 within an<br>
acceptor antibody framework having greater than 40% identity in the framework<br>
regions, or greater than 50%, or greater than 60%, or greater than 65% identity to<br>
the murine 2A10 donor antibody heavy chain variable region (SEQ ID NO.7).<br>
In another embodiment the CDRs of Table 5 are inserted into a human<br>
heavy chain variable region to give the following sequence (H99):<br><br>
In other embodiments, further back mutations are added to the H99 VH<br>
sequence in any one of positions (denoted by numerical residue position) 38, 40.<br>
48, 67, 68, 70, 72, 74 or 79; wherein each substituted amino acid residue is<br>
replaced with the amino acid residue at the equivalent position in SEQ ID NO 7<br><br>
(the heavy chain variable region of the donor antibody 2A10) and the number of<br>
substitutions is between 1 and 9. In other embodiments the number of<br>
substitutions is 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 8 or 9. H99 VH is the<br>
equivalent of H1 VH (SEQ ID NO.33) differing only in that the CDR H3 is GQSY<br>
in H99 instead of GQGY as found in H1.<br>
For optimal binding affinity, it was found for the humanisation of the mouse<br>
antibody 2A10 (the VH for which is SEQ ID NO. 7) that the pair of amino acid<br>
residues in positions 48 and 68, should be I and A respectively (as they exist in<br>
2A10) or M and V respectively (as they exist in H98). It is expected that the<br>
above finding is also of relevance to the humanisation of the G95M variant of<br>
2A10.<br>
In one embodiment the back mutations are located in the positions<br>
indicated in Table 6 below where the H99 residue at the relevant position is<br>
substituted with the 2A10 residue at that position (in the table,"-" means that<br>
there is no substitution in that position, and so the residue remains as in the<br>
sequence of H1):<br><br>

conventional IgG antibody format having full length (FL) variable and constant<br>
domain heavy chain sequences. Examples of full length (FL) lgG1 heavy chain<br>

L16FL (SEQ ID NO. 55 + SEQ ID NO.18).<br>
In another embodiment, the antibody or fragment thereof binds to the<br>
same human NOGO epitope as H28L16, or competes with the binding of H28L16<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The heavy chain variable regions of the invention may be formatted into<br>
the structure of a natural antibody or functional fragment or equivalent thereof.<br>
The antibody may therefore comprise the VH regions of the invention formatted<br>
into a full length antibody, a (Fab )2 fragment, a Fab fragment, or equivalent<br>
thereof (such as scFV, bi- tr- or tetra-bodies, Tandabs, etc.), when paired with an<br>
appropriate light chain. The antibody may be an lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, or lgG4; or<br>
IgM; IgA, IgE or IgD or a modified variant thereof. The constant domain of the<br>
antibody heavy chain may be selected accordingly. The light chain constant<br>
domain may be a kappa or lambda constant domain. Furthermore, the antibody<br>
may comprise modifications of all classes eg IgG dimers, Fc mutants that no<br>
longer bind Fc receptors or mediate Clq binding. The antibody may also be a<br>
chimeric antibody of the type described in WO86/01533 which comprises an<br>
antigen binding region and a non-immunoglobulin region.<br>
The constant region is selected according to the functionality required.<br>
Normally an lgG1 will demonstrate lytic ability through binding to complement<br>
and/or will mediate ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity). An lgG4 will be<br>
preferred if a non-cytotoxic blocking antibody is required. However, lgG4<br>
antibodies can demonstrate instability in production and therefore it may be more<br>
preferable to modify the generally more stable lgG1. Suggested modifications<br>
are described in EP0307434 preferred modifications include at positions 235 and<br><br>
237. The invention therefore provides a lytic or a non-lytic form of an antibody<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In preferred forms therefore the antibody of the invention is a full length<br>
(i.e. H2L2 tetramer) non-lytic lgG1 antibody having the heavy chain variable<br>
regions described herein.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding the<br>
heavy chain variable regions as described herein.<br>
"NOGO" refers to any NOGO polypeptide, including variant forms. This<br>
includes, but is not limited to, NOGO-A having 1192 amino acid residues<br>
(GenBank accession no. AJ251383); NOGO-B, a splice variant which lacks<br>
residues 186 to 1004 in the putative extracellular domain (GenBank accession<br>
no. AJ251384) and a shorter splice variant, NOGO-C, which also lacks residues<br>
186 to 1004 and also has smaller, alternative amino terminal domain (GenBank<br>
accession no. AJ251385) (Prinjha et al (2000) supra). All references to "NOGO"<br>
herein is understood to include any and all variant forms of NOGO such as<br>
NOGO-A and the splice variants described, unless a specific form is indicated.<br>
"Neutralising" and grammatical variations thereof refers to inhibition, either<br>
total or partial, of NOGO function including its binding to neurones and inhibition<br>
of neurite growth.<br>
The terms Fv, Fc, Fd, Fab, or F(ab)2 are used with their standard<br>
meanings (see, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, (1988)).<br>
A "chimeric antibody" refers to a type of engineered antibody which<br>
contains a naturally-occurring variable region (light chain and heavy chains)<br>
derived from a donor antibody in association with light and heavy chain constant<br>
regions derived from an acceptor antibody.<br>
A "humanized antibody" refers to a type of engineered antibody having its<br>
CDRs derived from a non-human donor immunoglobulin, the remaining<br>
immunoglobulin-derived parts of the molecule being derived from one (or more)<br>
human immunoglobulin(s). In addition, framework support residues may be<br>
altered to preserve binding affinity (see, e.g., Queen et al., Proc. Natl Acad Sci<br>
USA, 86:10029-10032 (1989), Hodgson etal., Bio/Technology, 9:421 (1991)). A<br>
suitable human acceptor antibody may be one selected from a conventional<br><br>
database, e.g., the KABAT® database, Los Alamos database, and Swiss Protein<br>
database, by homology to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the donor<br>
antibody (in this case the murine donor antibody 2A10). A human antibody<br>
characterized by a homology to the framework regions of the donor antibody (on<br>
an amino acid basis) may be suitable to provide a heavy chain constant region<br>
and/or a heavy chain variable framework region for insertion of the donor CDRs<br>
(see Table 1 for the 2A10 CDRs for insertion into the acceptor framework). A<br>
suitable acceptor antibody capable of donating light chain constant or variable<br>
framework regions may be selected in a similar manner. It should be noted that<br>
the acceptor antibody heavy and light chains are not required to originate from<br>
the same acceptor antibody. The prior art describes several ways of producing<br>
such humanised antibodies - see for example EP-A-0239400 and EP-A-054951.<br>
The term "donor antibody" refers to a non-human antibody which<br>
contributes the amino acid sequences of its variable regions, CDRs, or other<br>
functional fragments or analogs thereof to the humanised antibody, and thereby<br>
provide the humanised antibody with the antigenic specificity and neutralizing<br>
activity characteristic of the donor antibody.<br>
The term "acceptor antibody" refers to an antibody heterologous to the<br>
donor antibody, which provides the the amino acid sequences of its heavy and/or<br>
light chain framework regions and/or its heavy and/or light chain constant regions<br>
to the humanised antibody. The acceptor antibody may be" derived from any<br>
mammal provided that it is non-immunogenic in humans. Preferably the acceptor<br>
antibody is a human antibody.<br>
Alternatively, humanisation maybe achieved by a process of "veneering".<br>
A statistical analysis of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and<br>
light chain variable regions revealed that the precise patterns of exposed<br>
residues are different in human and murine antibodies, and most individual<br>
surface positions have a strong preference for a small number of different<br>
residues (see Padlan E.A. era/; (1991) Mol.lmmunol.28, 489-498 and Pedersen<br>
J.T. et a/(1994) J.Mol.Biol. 235; 959-973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the<br>
immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by replacing exposed residues in its<br>
framework regions that differ from those usually found in human antibodies.<br>
Because protein antigenicity can be correlated with surface accessibility,<br><br>
replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render the mouse<br>
variable region "invisible" to the human immune system (see also Mark G.E. etal<br>
(1994) in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology vol. 113: The pharmacology<br>
of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp105-134). This procedure of<br>
humanisation is referred to as "veneering" because only the surface of the<br>
antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed. A further<br>
alternative approach is set out in WO04/006955.<br>
"CDRs" are defined as the complementarity determining region amino acid<br>
sequences of an antibody which are the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulin<br>
heavy and light chains. See, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, 4th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,<br>
National Institutes of Health (1987). There are three heavy chain and three light<br>
chain CDRs (or CDR regions) in the variable portion of an immunoglobulin.<br>
Thus, "CDRs" as used herein refers to all three heavy chain CDRs, or all three<br>
light chain CDRs (or both all heavy and all light chain CDRs, if appropriate).<br>
The structure and protein folding of the antibody may mean that other residues<br>
are considered part of the antigen binding region and would be understood to be<br>
so by a skilled person. See for example Chothia et al., (1989) Conformations of<br>
immunoglobulin hypervariable regions; Nature 342, p877-883.<br>
A bispecific antibody is an antibody having binding specificities for at least<br>
two different epitopes. Methods of making such antibodies are known in the art.<br>
Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the<br>
coexpression of two immunoglobulin H chain-L chain pairs, where the two H<br>
chains have different binding specificities see Millstein etal, Nature 305 537-539<br>
(1983), WO93/08829 and Traunecker et al EMBO, 10, 1991, 3655-3659.<br>
Because of the random assortment of H and L chains, a potential mixture of ten<br>
different antibody structures are produced of which only one has the desired<br>
binding specificity. An alternative approach involves fusing the variable domains<br>
with the desired binding specificities to heavy chain constant region comprising at<br>
least part of the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the<br>
CH1 region containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at<br>
least one of the fusions. DNA encoding these fusions, and if desired the L chain<br>
are inserted into separate expression vectors and are then cotransfected into a<br><br>
suitable host organism. It is possible though to insert the coding sequences for<br>
two or all three chains into one expression vector. In one preferred approach,<br>
the bispecific antibody is composed of a H chain with a first binding specificity in<br>
one arm and a H-L chain pair, providing a second binding specificity in the other<br>
arm, see WO94/04690. See also Suresh et al Methods in Enzymology 121, 210,<br>
1986.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention there is provided a bispecific<br>
therapeutic antibody wherein at least one binding specificity of said antibody<br>
binds to human NOGO at the epitope described in SEQ ID NO. 60. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention the bispecific antibody comprises the heavy<br>
chain variable region CDR H3 sequence MQGY (SEQ ID NO. 45). In another<br>
embodiment the bispecific antibody comprises the following pairs of heavy and<br>
light chain variable regions: H27L16 (SEQ ID NO.48 + SEQ ID NO. 14), H28L13<br>
(SEQ ID NO.49 + SEQ ID NO.13) or H28L16 (SEQ ID NO.49 + SEQ ID NO.14).<br>
The antibodies of the present invention may be produced by transfection<br>
of a host cell with an expression vector comprising the coding sequence for the<br>
antibodies of the invention. An expression vector or recombinant plasmid is<br>
produced by placing these coding sequences for the antibody in operative<br>
association with conventional regulatory control sequences capable of controlling<br>
the replication and expression in, and/or secretion from, a host cell. Regulatory<br>
sequences include promoter sequences, e.g., CMV promoter, and signal<br>
sequences, which can be derived from other known antibodies. Similarly, a<br>
second expression vector can be produced having a DNA sequence which<br>
encodes a complementary antibody light or heavy chain. Preferably this second<br>
expression vector is identical to the first except insofar as the coding sequences<br>
and selectable markers are concerned, so to ensure as far as possible that each<br>
polypeptide chain is functionally expressed. Alternatively, the heavy and light<br>
chain coding sequences for the altered antibody may reside on a single vector.<br>
A selected host cell is co-transfected by conventional techniques with both<br>
the first and second vectors (or simply transfected by a single vector) to create<br>
the transfected host cell of the invention comprising both the recombinant or<br>
synthetic light and heavy chains. The transfected cell is then cultured by<br>
conventional techniques to produce the engineered antibody of the invention.<br><br>
The antibody which includes the association of both the recombinant heavy chain<br>
and/or light chain is screened from culture by appropriate assay, such as ELISA<br>
or RIA. Similar conventional techniques may be employed to construct other<br>
altered antibodies and molecules.<br>
One useful expression system is a glutamate synthetase system (such as<br>
sold by Lonza Biologies), particularly where the host cell is CHO or NSO (see<br>
below). Polynucleotide encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced<br>
using conventional procedures (e.g. oligonucleotide probes). Vectors that may be<br>
used include plasmid, virus, phage, transposons, minichromsomes of which<br>
plasmids are a typical embodiment. Generally such vectors further include a<br>
signal sequence, origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer<br>
element, a promoter and transcription termination sequences operably linked to<br>
the light and/or heavy chain polynucleotide so as to facilitate expression.<br>
Polynucleotide encoding the light and heavy chains may be inserted into<br>
separate vectors and introduced (e.g. by electroporation) into the same host cell<br>
or, if desired both the heavy chain and light chain can be inserted into the same<br>
vector for transfection into the host cell. Thus according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention there is provided a process of constructing a vector<br>
encoding the light and/or heavy chains of a therapeutic antibody or antigen<br>
binding fragment thereof of the invention, which method comprises inserting into<br>
a vector, a polynucleotide encoding either a light chain and/or heavy chain of a<br>
therapeutic antibody of the invention.<br>
In another embodiment there is provided a polynucletotide encoding a<br>
humanised heavy chain variable region having the sequence set forth as<br>
SEQ.I.D.NO: 47, 48 or 49.<br>
In another embodiment there is provided a polynucleotide encoding a humanised<br>
heavy chain having the sequence set forth as SEQ.I.D.NO: 53, 54 or 55.<br>
It will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art that due to the<br>
redundancy of the genetic code, alternative polynucleotides to those disclosed<br>
herein are also available that will encode the polypeptides of the invention.<br>
Suitable vectors for the cloning and subcloning steps employed in the<br>
methods and construction of the compositions of this invention may be selected<br>
by one of skill in the art For example, the conventional pUC series of cloning<br><br>
vectors may be used. One vector, pUC19, is commercially available from supply<br>
houses, such as Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) or Pharmacia<br>
(Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, any vector which is capable of replicating<br>
readily, has an abundance of cloning sites and selectable genes (e.g., antibiotic<br>
resistance), and is easily manipulated may be used for cloning. Thus, the<br>
selection of the cloning vector is not a limiting factor in this invention.<br>
Other preferable vector sequences include a poly A signal sequence, such as<br>
from bovine growth hormone (BGH) and the betaglobin promoter sequence<br>
(betaglopro). The expression vectors useful herein may be synthesized by<br>
techniques well known to those skilled in this art. Typical selection genes<br>
encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g.<br>
ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline or (b) complement auxiotrophic<br>
deficiencies or supply nutrients not available in the complex media. The<br>
selection scheme may involve arresting growth of the host cell. Cells, which<br>
have been successfully transformed with the genes encoding the therapeutic<br>
antibody of the present invention, survive due to e.g. drug resistance conferred<br>
by the selection marker. Another example is the so-called DHFR selection<br>
marker wherein transformants are cultured in the presence of methotrexate.<br>
CHO cells are a particularly useful cell line for the DHFR selection. Methods of<br>
selecting transformed host cells and amplifying the cell copy number of the<br>
transgene include using the DHFR system see Kaufman R.J. et al J.Mol.Biol.<br>
(1982) 159, 601-621, for review, see Werner RG, Noe W, Kopp K.Schluter M,"<br>
Appropriate mammalian expression systems for biopharmaceuticals",<br>
Arzneimittel-Forschung. 48(8):870-80, 1998 Aug. A further example is the<br>
glutamate synthetase expression system (Lonza Biologies). A suitable selection<br>
gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene; see Stinchcomb et al Nature 282, 38,<br>
1979.<br>
The components of such vectors, e.g. replicons, selection genes,<br>
enhancers, promoters, signal sequences and the like, may be obtained from<br>
commercial or natural sources or synthesized by known procedures for use in<br>
directing the expression and/or secretion of the product of the recombinant DNA<br>
in a selected host. Other appropriate expression vectors of which numerous<br><br>
types are known in the art for mammalian, bacterial, insect, yeast, and fungal<br>
expression may also be selected for this purpose.<br>
The present invention also encompasses a cell line transfected with a<br>
recombinant plasmid containing the coding sequences of the antibodies or<br>
equivalents of the present invention. Host cells useful for the cloning and other<br>
manipulations of these cloning vectors are also conventional. However, most<br>
desirably, cells from various strains of E. coli are used for replication of the<br>
cloning vectors and other steps in the construction of altered antibodies of this<br>
invention.<br>
Suitable host cells or cell lines for the expression of the antibody of the<br>
invention are preferably mammalian cells such as NSO, Sp2/0, CHO (e.g. DG44),<br>
COS, a fibroblast cell (e.g., 3T3), and myeloma cells, and more preferably a CHO<br>
or a myeloma cell. Human cells may be used, thus enabling the molecule to be<br>
modified with human glycosylation patterns. Alternatively, other eukaryotic cell<br>
lines may be employed. The selection of suitable mammalian host cells and<br>
methods for transformation, culture, amplification, screening and product<br>
production and purification are known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., cited<br>
above.<br>
Bacterial cells may prove useful as host cells suitable for the expression of<br>
the antibodies or fragments thereof (such as recombinant Fabs or ScFvs) of the<br>
present invention (see, e.g., Pluckthun, A., Immunol. Rev., 130:151-188 (1992)).<br>
However, due to the tendency of proteins expressed in bacterial cells to be in an<br>
unfolded or improperly folded form or in a non-glycosylated form, any<br>
recombinant fragment produced in a bacterial cell would have to be screened for<br>
retention of antigen binding ability. If the molecule expressed by the bacterial cell<br>
was produced in a properly folded form, that bacterial cell would be a desirable<br>
host. For example, various strains of E. coli used for expression are well-known<br>
as host cells in the field of biotechnology. Various strains of B. subtilis,<br>
Streptomyces, other bacilli and the like may also be employed in this method.<br>
Where desired, strains of yeast cells known to those skilled in the art are<br>
also available as host cells, as well as insect cells, e.g. Drosophila and<br>
Lepidoptera and viral expression systems. See, e.g. Miller et al., Genetic<br>
Engineering, 8:277-298, Plenum Press (1986) and references cited therein.<br><br>
The general methods by which the vectors may be constructed, the<br>
transfection methods required to produce the host cells of the invention, and<br>
culture methods necessary to produce the antibody of the invention from such<br>
host cell are all conventional techniques. Typically, the culture method of the<br>
present invention is a serum-free culture method, usually by culturing cells<br>
serum-free in suspension. Likewise, once produced, the antibodies of the<br>
invention may be purified from the cell culture contents according to standard<br>
procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns,<br>
column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like. Such techniques are<br>
within the skill of the art and do not limit this invention. For example, preparation<br>
of antibodies are described in WO 99/58679 and WO 96/16990.<br>
Yet another method of expression of the antibodies may utilize expression<br>
in a transgenic animal, such as described in U. S. Patent No. 4,873,316. This<br>
relates to an expression system using the animal's casein promoter which when<br>
transgenically incorporated into a mammal permits the female to produce the<br>
desired recombinant protein in its milk.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing<br>
an antibody of the invention which method comprises the step of culturing a host<br>
cell transformed or transfected with a vector encoding the light and/or heavy<br>
chain of the antibody of the invention and recovering the antibody thereby<br>
produced.<br>
Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing vectors encoding antibodies of<br>
the invention are prokaroytic, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable<br>
prokaryotic cells include eubacteria e.g. enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia<br>
e.g. E. Co//(for example ATCC 31,446; 31,537; 27,325), Enterobacter, Erwinia,<br>
Klebsiella Proteus, Salmonella e.g. Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia e.g.<br>
Serratia marcescans and Shigella as well as Bacilli such as B.subtilis and<br>
B.licheniformis (see DD 266 710), Pseudomonas such as P.aeruginosa and<br>
Streptomyces. Of the yeast host cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,<br>
schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces (e.g. ATCC 16,045; 12,424;<br>
24178; 56,500), yarrowia (EP402, 226), Pichia Pastoris (EP183, 070, see also<br>
Peng et al J.Biotechnol. 108 (2004) 185-192), Candida, Trichoderma reesia<br><br>
(EP244, 234;, Penicillin, Tolypocladium and Aspergillus hosts such as A.nidulans<br>
and A.niger are also contemplated.<br>
Although Prokaryotic and yeast host cells are specifically contemplated by<br>
the invention, typically however, host cells of the present invention are vertebrate<br>
cells. Suitable vertebrate host cells include mammalian cells such as COS-1<br>
(ATCC No.CRL 1650) COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651), human embryonic kidney line<br>
293, baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) (ATCC CRL. 1632), BHK570 (ATCC NO:<br>
CRL 10314), 293 (ATCC NO.CRL 1573), Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO (e.g.<br>
CHO-K1, ATCC NO: CCL 61, DHFR-CHO cell line such as DG44 (see Urlaub et<br>
al, (1986) Somatic Cell Mol.Genet.12, 555-556)), particularly those CHO cell lines<br>
adapted for suspension culture, mouse sertoli cells, monkey kidney cells, African<br>
green monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1587), HELA cells, canine kidney cells<br>
(ATCC CCL 34), human lung cells (ATCC CCL 75), Hep G2 and myeloma or<br>
lymphoma cells e.g. NSO (see US 5,807,715), Sp2/0, Y0.<br>
Thus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided a stably<br>
transformed host cell comprising a vector encoding a heavy chain and/or light<br>
chain of the therapeutic antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof as<br>
described herein. Typically such host cells comprise a first vector encoding the<br>
light chain and a second vector encoding said heavy chain.<br>
Host cells transformed with vectors encoding the therapeutic antibodies of<br>
the invention or antigen binding fragments thereof may be cultured by any<br>
method known to those skilled in the art. Host cells may be cultured in spinner<br>
flasks, roller bottles or hollow fibre systems but it is preferred for large scale<br>
production that stirred tank reactors are used particularly for suspension cultures.<br>
Typically the stirred tankers are adapted for aeration using e.g. spargers, baffles<br>
or low shear impellers. For bubble columns and airlift reactors direct aeration<br>
with air or oxygen bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells are cultured in a<br>
serum free culture media it is preferred that the media is supplemented with a cell<br>
protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to help prevent cell damage as a result of<br>
the aeration process. Depending on the host cell characteristics, either<br>
microcarriers maybe used as growth substrates for anchorage dependent cell<br>
lines or the cells maybe adapted to suspension culture (which is typical). The<br>
culturing of host cells, particularly vertebrate host cells may utilise a variety of<br><br>
operational modes such as fed-batch, repeated batch processing (see Drapeau<br>
et al (1994) cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch process or perfusion<br>
culture. Although recombinantly transformed mammalian host cells may be<br>
cultured in serum-containing media such media comprising fetal calf serum<br>
(FCS), it is preferred that such host cells are cultured in synthetic serum -free<br>
media such as disclosed in Keen et a/(1995) Cytotechnology 17:153-163, or<br>
commercially available media such as ProCHO-CDM or UltraCHO™ (Cambrex<br>
NJ, USA), supplemented where necessary with an energy source such as<br>
glucose and synthetic growth factors such as recombinant insulin. The serum-<br>
free culturing of host cells may require that those cells are adapted to grow in<br>
serum free conditions. One adaptation approach is to culture such host cells in<br>
serum containing media and repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for<br>
the serum-free media so that the host cells learn to adapt in serum free<br>
conditions (see e.g. Scharfenberg K et al (1995) in Animal Cell technology:<br>
Developments towards the 21st century (Beuvery E.C. et al eds), pp619-623,<br>
Kluwer Academic publishers).<br>
Antibodies of the invention secreted into the media may be recovered and<br>
purified from the media using a variety of techniques to provide a degree of<br>
purification suitable for the intended use. For example the use of therapeutic<br>
antibodies of the invention for the treatment of human patients typically mandates<br>
at least 95% purity, more typically 98% or 99% purity compared to the culture<br>
media comprising the therapeutic antibodies. In the first instance, cell debris<br>
from the culture media is typically removed using centrifugation followed by a<br>
clarification step of the supernatant using e.g. microfiltration, ultrafiltration and/or<br>
depth filtration. A variety of other techniques such as dialysis and gel<br>
electrophoresis and chromatographic techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA),<br>
affinity chromatography (optionally involving an affinity tagging system such as<br>
polyhistidine) and/or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC, see US 5,<br>
429,746) are available. In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention,<br>
following various clarification steps, are captured using Protein A or G affinity<br>
chromatography followed by further chromatography steps such as ion exchange<br>
and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size exclusion<br>
chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation. Typically, various virus<br><br>
removal steps are also employed (e.g. nanofiltration using e.g. a DV-20 filter).<br>
Following these various steps, a purified (typically monoclonal) preparation<br>
comprising at least 75mg/ml or greater e.g. 100mg/ml or greater of the antibody<br>
of the invention or antigen binding fragment thereof is provided and therefore<br>
forms an embodiment of the invention. Suitably such preparations are<br>
substantially free of aggregated forms of antibodies of the invention.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
producing an anti-NOGO antibody of the present invention which specifically<br>
binds to and neutralises the activity of human NOGD-A which method comprises<br>
the steps of;<br>
(a)	providing a first vector encoding a heavy chain of the antibody;<br>
(b)	providing a second vector encoding the light chain of the antibody;<br>
(c)	tranforming a mammalian host cell (e.g. CHO) with said first and<br>
second vectors;<br>
(d)	culturing the host cell of step (c) under conditions conducive to the<br>
secretion of the antibody from said host cell into said culture media;<br>
(e)	recovering the secreted antibody of step (d).<br>
Once expressed by the desired method, the antibody is then examined for<br>
in vitro activity by use of an appropriate assay. Presently conventional ELISA<br>
assay formats are employed to assess qualitative and quantitative binding of the<br>
antibody to NOGO. Additionally, other in vitro assays may also be used to verify<br>
neutralizing efficacy prior to subsequent human clinical studies performed to<br>
evaluate the persistence of the antibody in the body despite the usual clearance<br>
mechanisms.<br>
Other modifications to the antibodies of the present invention include<br>
glycosylation variants of the antibodies of the invention. Glycosylation of<br>
antibodies at conserved positions in their constant regions is known to have a<br>
profound effect on antibody function, particularly effector functioning such as<br>
those described above, see for example, Boyd et a/ (1996), Mol.Immunol. 32,<br>
1311-1318. Glycosylation variants of the therapeutic antibodies or antigen<br>
binding fragments thereof of the present invention wherein one or more<br>
carbonhydrate moiety is added, substituted, deleted or modified are<br><br>
contemplated. Introduction of an asparagine-X-serine or asparagine-X-threonine<br>
motif creates a potential site for enzymatic attachment of carbanhydrate moieties<br>
and may therefore be used to manipulate the glycosylation of an antibody. In<br>
Raju et al (2001) Biochemistry 40, 8868-8876 the terminal sialyation of a TNFR-<br>
IgG immunoadhesin was increased through a process of regalactosylation and/or<br>
resialylation using beta-1,4-galactosyltransferace and/or alpha, 2,3<br>
sialyltransferase. Increasing the terminal sialylation is believed to increase the<br>
half-life of the immunoglobulin. Antibodies, in common with most glycoproteins,<br>
are typically produced in nature as a mixture of glycoforms. This mixture is<br>
particularly apparent when antibodies are produced in eukaryotic, particularly<br>
mammalian cells. A variety of methods have been developed to manufacture<br>
defined glycoforms, see Zhang et al Science (2004), 303, 371, Sears et al,<br>
Science, (2001) 291, 2344, Wacker et al (2002) Science, 298 1790, Davis et al<br>
(2002) Chem.Rev. 102, 579, Hang et al (2001) Acc.Chem.Res 34, 727. Thus the<br>
invention concerns a plurality of therapeutic (typically monoclonal) antibodies<br>
(which maybe of the IgG isotype, e.g. lgG1) as described herein comprising a<br>
defined number (e.g. 7 or less, for example 5 or less such as two or a single)<br>
glycoform(s) of said antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof.<br>
The therapeutic agents of this invention may be administered as a<br>
prophylactic or following the stroke event/on-set of clinical symptoms, or as<br>
otherwise needed. The dose and duration of treatment relates to the relative<br>
duration of the molecules of the present invention in the human circulation, and<br>
can be adjusted by one of skill in the art depending upon the condition being<br>
treated and the general health of the patient. It is envisaged that repeated dosing<br>
(e.g. once a week or once every two weeks) over an extended time period (e.g.<br>
four to six months) maybe required to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy.<br>
The mode of administration of the therapeutic agent of the invention may<br>
be any suitable route which delivers the agent to the host. The antibodies, and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are particularly useful for parenteral<br>
administration, i.e., subcutaneously (s.c), intrathecally, intraperitoneally (i.p.),<br>
intramuscularly (i.m.), intravenously (i.v.), or intranasally (i.n.).<br>
Therapeutic agents of the invention may be prepared as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing an effective amount of the antibody of the invention as<br><br>
an active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In the prophylactic<br>
agent of the invention, an aqueous suspension or solution containing the<br>
engineered antibody, preferably buffered at physiological pH, in a form ready for<br>
injection is preferred. The compositions for parenteral administration will<br>
commonly comprise a solution of the antibody of the invention or a cocktail<br>
thereof dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous<br>
carrier. A variety of aqueous carriers may be employed, e.g., 0.9% saline, 0.3%<br>
glycine, and the like. These solutions are sterile and generally free of particulate<br>
matter. These solutions may be sterilized by conventional, well known<br>
sterilization techniques (e.g., filtration). The compositions may contain<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate<br>
physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, etc. The<br>
concentration of the antibody of the invention in such pharmaceutical formulation<br>
can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5%, usually at or at least about 1 % to<br>
as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily based on fluid<br>
volumes, viscosities, etc., according to the particular mode of administration<br>
selected.<br>
Thus, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention for intramuscular<br>
injection could be prepared to contain 1 mL sterile buffered water, and between<br>
about 1 ng to about 100 mg, e.g. about 50 ng to about 30 mg or more preferably,<br>
about 5 mg to about 25 mg, of an antibody of the invention. Similarly, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention for intravenous infusion could be<br>
made up to contain about 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution, and about 1 to about<br>
30 and preferably 5 mg to about 25 mg of an engineered antibody of the<br>
invention per ml of Ringer's solution. Actual methods for preparing parenterally<br>
administrable compositions are well known or will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art and are described in more detail in, for example, Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Science, 15th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton,<br>
Pennsylvania. For the preparation of intravenously administrable antibody<br>

It is preferred that the therapeutic agent of the invention, when in a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation, be present in unit dose forms. The appropriate<br>
therapeutically effective dose will be determined readily by those of skill in the art.<br>
To effectively treat stroke and other neurological diseases in a human, one dose<br>
within the range of 700 to 3500 mg per 70 kg body weight of an antibody of this<br>
invention is envisaged to be administered parenterally, preferably s.c, i.v. or i.m.<br>

intervals selected as appropriate by a physician.<br>
The antibodies described herein can be lyophilized for storage and<br>

reconstitution techniques can be employed.<br>

As used herein, the term "functional recovery" refers to a motor and/or<br>
sensory and/or behavioural improvement in a subject following e.g. an ischemic<br>
event or injury or on-set of clinical symptoms. Functional recovery in humans<br>
may be evaluated by instruments designed to measure elemental neurological<br>
functions such as motor strength, sensation and coordination, cognitive functions<br>
such as memory, language and the ability to follow directions, and functional<br>
capacities such as basic activities of daily living or instrumental activities.<br>
Recovery of elemental neurological function can be measured with instruments<br>
such as the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), recovery of cognitive function can be<br>
measured with neuropsychological tests such as Boston Naming Test, Trail-<br>
making Tests, and California Verbal Learning Test, and activities of daily living<br>
may be measured with instruments such as the ADCS/ADL (Alzheimer's Disease<br>
Clinical Studies/Activities of Daily Living) scale or the Bristol Activities of Daily<br>
Living Scale, all tests and scales known in the art.<br>
The following examples illustrate but do not limit the invention.<br>
Example 1. Construction and expression of humanised anti-NOGO antibodies<br>
Humanised VH and VL constructs were prepared de novo by build up of<br>
overlapping oligonucleotides including restriction sites for cloning into Rld and<br>
Rln mammalian expression vectors (or any other suitable expression vector for<br><br>
expression of proteins in mammalian cells) as well as a human signal sequence.<br>
Hind III and Spe I restriction sites were introduced to frame the VH domain<br>
containing the CAMPATH-1H signal sequence for cloning into Rid containing the<br>
human v1 mutated constant region to prevent ADCC and CDC activity (L235A<br>
and G237A- EU Index numbering system). Hind III and BsiWI restriction sites<br>
were introduced to frame the VL domain containing the CAMPATH-1H signal<br>
sequence for cloning into Rln containing the human kappa constant region.<br>
CAMPATH-1H signal sequence: MGWSCIILFLVATATGVHS (SEQ.ID.NO:31)<br>
Plasmids encoding human IgG heavy chain amino acid sequences,<br>
wherein the CDR were that described in table 2, were produced. Plasmids<br>
encoding human IgG heavy chain amino acid sequences, wherein the CDRs<br>
were that described in table 3, were produced from those existing earlier<br>
plasmids by introducing<br>
single point mutations, G95M (Kabat numbering), using the Quickchange kit<br>
(Stratagene).<br>
The following table discloses which full length heavy chain protein<br>
sequences were made in the plasmid vectors and which of the sequences were<br>
paired, in the sense that the only difference in the amino acid sequences of the<br>
paired full length (FL) heavy chain sequences was a substitution at G95M (kabat<br>
numbering) within the CDR H3 of the variable region:<br><br>
Plasmids encoding the heavy chains were then co-transfected into CHO<br>
cells (for details see example 2) with the one of the following full length light chain<br>
sequences: L11 FL (SEQ ID NO. 36), L13 FL (SEQ ID NO. 17), or L16 FL(SEQ<br>
ID NO. 18).<br><br>
In parallel a chimera termed HcLc (which is the chimera of 2A10 (SEQ ID<br>
NO. 9 and 10 - the full length chains comprising the 2A10 murine VH (SEQ ID<br>
NO. 7) and VL (SEQ ID NO.8) and human IgG constant regions)) was produced.<br>
Example 2, Antibody expression in CHO cells<br>
Rid and Rln plasmids (or other vectors suitable for use in mammalian<br>
cells) encoding the heavy and light chains respectively were transiently co-<br>
transfected into CHO cells and expressed at small scale or large scale to<br>
produce antibody. Alternatively the same plasmids were co-transfected into<br>
DHFR- CHO cells by electroporation and a stable polyclonal population of cells<br>
expressing the appropriate antibody were selected using a nucleoside-free media<br>
(Rid contains the DHFR gene, Rln contains a neomycin selection marker). In<br>
some assays, antibodies were assessed directly from the tissue culture<br>
supernatant. In other assays, recombinant antibody was recovered and purified<br>
by affinity chromatography on Protein A sepharose.<br>
Example 3, Humanised anti-NOGO antibody binds to NOGO<br>
GST-human NOGO-A56 (see example 5) at 0.05-1 ug/ml in PBS was<br>
coated onto Nunc Immunosorp plates (100ul per well) at4°C overnight. Wells<br>
were rinsed once with TBS + 0.05% Tween (TBST) then incubated with 2% BSA<br>
in TBST to block non-specific binding sites at room temperature for 1hour.<br>
Antibodies were diluted in TBST + 2% BSA to 10ug/ml and 1/2 dilutions made<br>
from this. Antibodies were added to wells in duplicate and incubated at room<br>
temperature for 1 hour. Wells were washed three times with TBST then incubated<br>
with anti-human kappa peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) for 1 hour. The wells were<br>
washed three times with TBST and then incubated with 100ul OPD peroxidase<br>
substrate (Sigma) per well for 10 minutes. The colour reaction was stopped by<br>
the addition of 25ul concentrated H2SO4. Optical density at 490nm was measured<br>
using a plate reader. Background values read from wells with no antibody were<br>
subtracted.<br><br>
Figures 1-4 illustrate the dose-dependent binding of humanised antibodies<br>
in comparison with the chimera (termed HcLc which is the chimera of 2A10<br>
(comprising the 2A10 murine VH (SEQ ID NO. 7) and VL (SEQ ID NO.8) and<br>
human IgG constant regions)) to GST-human NOGO-A56 (see Example 5 for<br>
details) in an ELISA assay. The Y-axis shows the measured optical density (OD)<br>
at 490nm, a quantitative measure of antibody captured in the wells. The X-axis<br>
shows the concentration of antibody used (mcg/ml) per well at each data point.<br>
The antibody material used in Figures 1-4 is purified antibody generated<br>
by either the polyclonal expression system or large scale transient transfections.<br>
In these cases, IgG levels were quantified by ELISA and optical density.<br>
The results from the experiments shown in Figures 1-4 shows that the<br>
inclusion of the G95M mutation improves the performance of the antibody. The<br>
only exception is H27L16 shown in Figure 3 and 4 which performed very poorly.<br>
We believe that this data resulted from an unidentified technical problem with the<br>
H27L16 assay, since H27L16 has otherwise consistently performed well in other<br>
assays (in ELISA shown in Figures 1 and 2, and in BIAcore assays (Tables 9 and<br>
10)). H27L16 has also been shown to work very well in later experiments (see<br>
Figures 11 and 12).<br>
Example 4, Antibody quantification protocol<br>
Nunc Immunosorp plates were coated with a goat anti-human IgG chain<br>
capture antibody (Sigma #13382) at 2ug/ml in Bicarbonate buffer (Sigma #C3041)<br>
and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed twice with TBS<br>
containing 0.05% Tween20 (TBST) and blocked with 200ul TBST containing 2%<br>
(or from 1-3%) BSA (block buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature. The plates were<br>
washed twice with TBST. Tissue culture supernatants containing antibody were<br>
titrated across the plate in 2-fold dilution steps into block buffer and incubated at<br>
room temperature for 1 hr. The plates were washed three times with TBST. HRP<br>
conjugated antibody H23 (goat anti-human kappa chain, Sigma #A7164) was<br>
diluted 1:2000 in TBST and 100ul added to each well. The plates were incubated<br>
at room temperature for 1hr. The plates were washed three times with TBST and<br>
developed with 100ul of Fast-OPD substrate (Sigma #P9187). Colour was<br>
allowed to develop for 5-1 Omins after which time the ELISA was stopped with<br><br>
25ul 3M H2SO4. The absorbance at 490nM was read plate and antibody<br>
concentration determined by. reference to a standard curve.<br>
Example 5, Production ofNOGO-A Fragment (NOGO-A56. SEQ.ID.NO:32)<br>
A cDNA sequence encoding a polypeptide comprising arnino acids 586-<br>
785 and a GST tag(SEQ.I.D.NO:32) of human NOGO-A was created by cloning a<br>
cDNA encoding amino acids 586-785 of human NOGO-A into the BamHI-Xhol<br>
sites of pGEX-6P1 to generate a GST-tagged fusion protein designated GST-<br>
human-NOGO-A56. Plasmid was expressed in BL21 cells in 2XTY medium with<br>
100ug/ml ampicillin following induction with IPTG to 0.5mM at 37C for 3hours.<br>
Cell pellets were lysed by sonication and the fusion protein purified using<br>
Glutathione-sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia) following manufacturers<br>
instructions. Purified protein was eluted using reduced glutathione and<br>
extensively dialysed against PBS, quantitated using BSA standards and a<br>
BioRad coomassie based protein assay and then stored in aliquots at -80C.<br>
Example 6, BiaCore Analysis of humanised Anti NOGO Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
The binding kinetics of the anti-NOGO monoclonal antibody (mAb) to<br>
recombinantly expressed GST-human NOGO-A was analysed using the<br>
Biacore3000 biosensor or BIAcore T100. The hNOGO-A chip was prepared as<br>
follows:<br>
Method<br>
GST-human NOGO-A56 was immobilised to a CM5 chip by primary amine<br>
coupling using the Biacore Wizard program designed for targeted immobilisation<br>
levels. The CM5 sensor surface was activated by passing a solution of 50mM N-<br>
hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) and 200mM N-ethyl-N'-dimethylaminopropyl<br>
carbonide (EDC). Then GST-human NOGO-A56in sodium acetate buffer, pH5.0<br>
or pH 4.5, was passed over the chip and immobilised. After immobilisation was<br>
complete any still activated esters were blocked by an injection of 1M<br>
ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH8.5.<br>
The anti-NOGO mAbs were diluted down in HBS-EP (10mM HEPES, pH<br>
7.4,150mM NaCI, 3mM EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 surfactant) for the BIAcore<br>
3000 or HBS-EP+ (10mM HEPES, pH 7.4,150mM NaCI, 3mM EDTA, and 0.05%<br><br>
P-20 surfactant) in the case of the T100 and binding studies were carried out at<br>
range of defined antibody concentrations. All runs were referenced against a<br>
blanked sensor surface (one that had been activated and blocked as described<br>
earlier but had no addition of ligand). Analysis of binding was carried out using<br>
the BIAevaluation kinetic analysis software version 4.1 for the BIAcore 3000 and<br>
T100 kinetic analysis software version 1.0. Biacore analysis of other antibodies<br>
of the invention essentially followed the same protocol as described herein.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the BIAcore experiments were performed at 25°C.<br>
In the following Results section each data table represents the results<br>
obtained from an individual experiment.<br><br><br><br>
Example 7: BiaCore Analysis of humanised Anti NOGO Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
using off-rate ranking<br>
The GST-human NOGO-A56 chip was prepared as for kinetic analysis.<br>
Cell supernatants where taken directly from transient transfections of CH0-K1<br>
cells. These were passed directly over the sensor surface and the interaction<br>
measured. A mock transfected cell supernatant was used for double referencing<br>
to remove any artefacts due to the tissue culture media. All runs were referenced<br>
against a blanked sensor surface (one that had been activated and blocked as<br>
described earlier but had no addition of ligand). Analysis of binding was carried<br>
out using the BIAevaluation kinetic analysis software version 4.1.<br>
Example 8: Peotide Mapping<br>
47 overlapping peptides spanning the NOGO-A56 portion of GST-human<br>
NOGO-A56 domain (SEQ ID NO. 32) were obtained (from Mimotope™). The<br><br>
peptides are 16 amino acids in length with a twelve amino acid overlap with the<br>
adjacent peptide (each peptide further comprising a biotin-SGSG sequence at<br>
the N-terminus) with the exception of the first peptide which has a GSG-biocytin<br>
tag at the C-terminus. The peptides were used to epitope map the binding site of<br>
2A10andH28L16.<br>
Method for epitope mapping:<br>
Streptavidin at 5(ig/rnl in sterile water was coated onto Nunc immunosorp<br>
plates (100 |il per well) at 37°C overnight. The plates were rinsed 3 times with<br>
PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBST) then blocked with 3% BSA in PBST at 4°C<br>
overnight. The plates were washed 3 times with PBST. Peptides were then<br>
added to the wells at a concentration of approximately 10 fig/ml (diluted in 3%<br>
BSA in PBST) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were<br>
washed 3 times with PBST then incubated for 1 hour with anti-NOGO antibodies<br>
diluted to 5 fj.g/ml in 3% BSA in PBST. The plates were washed 3 times with<br>
PBST then incubated with anti-human or anti-mouse kappa peroxidase conjugate<br>
(1:1000, diluted in 3% BSA in PBST) for 1 hour. The plates were washed 3 times<br>
with PBST and then incubated with 100 ^l OPD peroxidase substrate (Sigma) per<br>
well for 10 minutes. The colour reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 ^l 3<br>
molar H2SO4. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a plate reader.<br>
The results are shown in figures 5 (epitope mapping using H28L16), figure<br>
6 (epitope mapping using 2A10). Figures 5 and 6 show the results of the epitope<br>
mapping of 2A10 and H28L16, respectively. The data shown indicates that 2A10<br>
and H28L16 bind to peptides 6 and 7 of which the NOGO specific portion is given<br>
in SEQ ID NO.73 and SEQ ID NO.74 respectively, both of which contain the<br>
sequence VLPDIVMEAPLN. These results indicate that VLPDIVMEAPLN (SEQ<br>
ID NO.60) contains the binding epitope of 2A10 and H28L16.<br>
Example 9: Comparison ofHcLc and HcLc containing the G95M mutation of the<br>
CDRH3<br>
A modified variant of HcLc was constructed from existing expression<br>
plasmids by introducing a single point mutation, G95M (Kabat numbering), using<br><br>
the Quikchange kit (Stratagene). The protein sequence of the variable heavy<br>
domain He (G95M) protein is given in SEQ ID 59.<br>
Hc(G95M)Lc was expressed in CHO cells as described previously. The<br>
antibody was quantified as described in Example 4. Figures 7 and Figure 8 show<br>
a comparison of the binding activity of Hc(G95M)Lc and HcLc as determined<br>
using a human NOGO-A binding ELISA when NOGO was coated onto Nunc<br>
immunosorp plates at 0.05 (Figure 7) and 1 ug/ml (Figure 8). Table below shows<br>
a comparison of the binding affinities of Hc(G95M)Lc and HcLc.<br><br>
The data demonstrates that the G95M substitution within CDR H3 not only<br>
increases the binding activity of the humanised antibodies (H6L13), but also the<br>
murine donor antibody 2A10 (HcLc).<br>
Example 10: Construction and testing of NOGO antibodies containing<br>
substitutions in CDR H3<br>
A panel of 90 heavy chain variable regions was created by single point<br>
mutations in the residues contained in the CDR H3, or the preceding Leucine.<br>
Specifically, vectors encoding a heavy chain (based on H6FL, SEQ ID NO. 15)<br>
were made encoding heavy chain variable regions where each amino acid<br>
residue in CDR H3 and the preceding Leucine was substituted (using the<br>
Quikchange kit (Stratagene)) with all other naturally occurring amino acids,<br>
excluding cysteine, and expressed in conjunction with a light chain (L13FL, SEQ<br>
ID NO. 17) to give 90 different antibodies. These antibodies were assayed for<br>
binding to NOGO in ELISA and Biacore experiments.<br><br>
Figures 9 and 10 show a comparison of the binding activity of the variants<br>
of H6FL in comparison to H6FL L13FL. Tables 14 and 15 show a comparison of<br>
the off-rate kinetics as measured by Biacore - only the results for those<br>
antibodies that had a measurable off rate in the Biacore assay and had<br>
comparable binding activity to H6L13 in ELISA are shown.<br><br>
Conclusions<br>
The results indicate that the antibodies which retain the binding properties of the<br>
murine 2A10, and the GQGY containing antibody H6L13, are those containing<br>
following CDR H3: RQGY, IQGY, MQGY, GDGY, GIGY, GSGY, GQNY, GQYY,<br>
GQSY, GQLY, GQFY, GQGW, WQGY, GAGY, GLGY, GVGY, GQWY.<br>

back-mutations for the whole antibody (2x heavy chain + 2x light chain).<br><br>
In vitro binding characteristics<br>
In an attempt to rank the antibodies, their binding properties were<br>
investigated in a range of assays including ELISA, reverse format ELISA,<br>
competition ELISA, Biacore and by flow cytometry.<br>
11.1 Binding to recombinant human NOGO-A in ELISA<br>
The ability of the antibodies to bind recombinant human Nogo-A (GST-<br>
human Nogo-A 56) was investigated by various related ELISA assays (performed<br>
in a related, but slightly different, protocol as that described in Example 3). In the<br>
first assay, the recombinant Nogo-A is directly coated to the plate at various<br>
different antigen concentrations. The results of the direct binding ELISA when the<br>
antigen is loaded at 1mcg/ml or 0.05mcg/ml are shown in Figure 11A and Figure<br>
11B respectively. The data confirms that all the antibodies show comparable<br>
binding activity to recombinant human Nogo-A when compared with the chimeric<br>
form of the parental antibody (HcLc). At higher antigen coating concentrations,<br>
all antibodies yield a similar EC50 value. In contrast, at a lower antigen coating<br>
concentration the assay was able to discriminate between the antibodies.<br>
Although saturation curves were not obtained, a trend analysis on the lines<br>
revealed the following rank order: H27L16&gt;H28L16, H28L13, H20L16.<br>
In a parallel experiment, the format of the assay was reversed. In this<br>
format, the antibody is captured on to the plate and the binding of the<br>
recombinant human Nogo-A (GST-human Nogo-A-56) detected using the GST<br>
tag. The results of the reverse format ELISA are shown in Figure 12. The data<br><br>
confirms that all the antibodies show comparable binding activity to recombinant<br>
human Nogo-A when compared with the chimeric form of the parental antibody<br>
(HcLc). This format of the binding ELISA did not distinguish between the<br>
antibodies.<br>
11.2	Competition ELISA<br>
The ability of the antibodies to compete directly with the parental antibody<br>
for the same epitope on human Nogo-A was assessed using a competition<br>
ELISA. The recombinant human Nogo-A (GST-human Nogo-A 56) was coated<br>
onto the plates. The parental antibody 2A10 and the humanised antibodies were<br>
pre-mixed prior to adding to the plates. The binding of 2A10 was quantified using<br>
an anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (Dakocytomation, #P0260). The results<br>
shown in Figure 13 confirm that all four antibodies can compete with 2A10. This<br>
suggests that the humanised antibodies and parental antibody recognise an<br>
overlapping epitope on human Nogo-A. Furthermore, the activity of the<br>
humanised antibodies is comparable or better than the chimera HcLc. The<br>
results indicate that H27L16, H28L16 and H28L13 are more potent than H20L16.<br>
11.3	Biacore Affinity measurements<br>
Biacore was used to determine affinities and rank antibodies using two<br>
different methodologies. In the first approach, the recombinant Nogo-A was<br>
coupled to the surface of the chip and anti-Nogo-A antibodies passed over this<br>
surface. In the second approach, Protein A was used to capture the antibody<br>
onto the surface of the chip over which the recombinant GST-human Nogo-A56<br>
was passed. The results shown in Table 16 were obtained by coupling the<br>
antigen to the surface and confirm that all four antibodies show<br>
comparable/better affinity than the parental antibody (HcLc). Based on the<br>
average of six independent runs, the antibodies rank in the following order in<br>
terms of overall affinity: H27L16&gt;H28L16&gt;H28L13&gt;H20L16, consistent with the<br>
rank order of the direct binding ELISA (Figure 11B). In the case of H27L16 and<br>
H28L16, the humanised antibodies demonstrate 2-3x higher affinity that the<br>
parental antibody (HcLc).<br><br>
Table 16 - Binding kinetics of the anti-Nogo-A humanised antibodies to<br>
recombinant human Nogo-A (GST-human Nogo-A 56) as determined using the<br>
Biacore TWO. The antigen was bound to the CMS chip by primary amine<br>
coupling. The antibodies were flowed over a various concentrations (0.125-<br>
8nM). The values show the mean and standard deviation (in brackets) of six<br>
independent runs carried out in duplicate. Each completed data set was<br>
analysed independently prior to the calculation of mean and standard deviation.<br>
**Only 11 sets of data analysed forH20L16 as one set could not be analysed.<br><br>
In a similar manner to the ELISA, the kinetics of antibody binding to<br>
recombinant human Nogo-A (GST-human Nogo-A 56) was also assessed in a<br>
reverse format (see Example 11.1). In this assay, the humanised antibodies<br>
were captured onto the CM5 chip by Protein A. The averaged results for six<br>
independent runs are shown in Table 17. Consistent with the reverse format<br>
ELISA, all the humanised Nogo-A antibodies show similar binding kinetics to the<br>
chimera (HcLc) in the reverse format Biacore.<br><br>
Table 17-Reverse format binding kinetics of the anti-Nogo-A humanised<br>
antibodies to recombinant human Nogo-A (GST Nogo-A. 5+6) as determined<br>
using the Biacore T100. Protein A was immobilised to approximately 4000RUs by<br>
primary amine and used to capture 200-300RUs of the sample antibodies.<br>
Recombinant human Nogo-A was passed over at various concentrations (0.125-<br>
8nM). The values show the mean and standard deviation (in brackets) of three<br>
independent runs in duplicate. Each data set was independently analysed prior<br>
to the calculation of the mean and standard deviation.<br><br>
11.4 Binding to native human NOG O<br>
To demonstrate that the humanised antibodies bind to native human<br>
Nogo-A with a profile comparable to the parental antibody, two flow cytometry<br>
based assays were developed. In the first assay, a CHO-K1-based cell line<br>
expressing human Nogo-A extracellular domain on the cell surface was<br>
generated. Binding of the humanised anti-Nogo-A antibodies was assessed by<br>
flow cytometry using a PE-labelled anti-human IgG (Sigma, #P8047). Figure 14<br>
below shows a typical profile for the anti-Nogo-A antibodies on the CHO-Nogo-A<br>
cell line. Whilst the assay is not sensitive enough to distinguish between the<br>
antibodies, the results confirm that all four antibodies can recognise cell surface<br>
expressed human Nogo-A at levels comparable to that of the chimera. None of<br>
the antibodies recognise the parental cell line (CHO-K1 - data not shown).<br>
In the second assay, the ability of the humanised antibodies to bind native<br>
Nogo-A was assessed using a human neuroblastoma cell line - IMR32. This cell<br>
line is characterised by high intracellular/low cell surface levels of Nogo-A<br>
protein. In an attempt to increase the binding signal, the assay was set-up to<br><br>
detect intracellular Nogo-A (ER-resident). IMR32 cells were permeabilised and<br>
fixed prior to staining with the anti-Nogo-A humanised antibodies. Binding of the<br>
antibodies to Nogo-A was detected using an anti-human IgG-PE labelled<br>
secondary (Sigma, #P8047). The results, shown in Figure 15 below, confirm<br>
that all the antibodies bind to intracellular Nogo-A at levels comparable or higher<br>
than the parental antibody HcLc. These data, in conjunction with the results from<br>
the CHO-Nogo-A cell line, confirm that the humanised antibodies can recognise a<br>
more native form of the Nogo-A protein at levels comparable or better than the<br>
chimera, HcLc. The assays are not sufficiently sensitive to rank the antibody<br>
panel.<br>
11.5 Neurite-outgrowth assays<br>
Humanised anti-Nogo-A antibodies were tested for their ability to<br>
neutralise neurite-outgrowth (NO) inhibitory activity of Nogo-A in an assay that is<br>
based on quantifying NO as described previously. Antibodies tested in the assay<br>
were selected on the basis of their binding kinetics for Nogo-A. High affinity<br>
humanised antibodies namely, H28L16, H27L16, H20L16 and for reference their<br>
parental antibodies 2A10 (mouse monoclonal) and HcLc (human mouse chimera)<br>
were tested for Nogo-A neutralisation. For comparison, antibody 11C7 (see<br>
Example 13) was also tested in the assay.<br>
In order to test the neutralising activity of selected humanised antibodies,<br>
wells coated with human recombinant GST-human Nogo-A56 and treated with<br>
varying concentrations of antibodies at 37°C for 1h prior to the addition of<br>
cerebellum granular neurons (CGNs). Control wells were treated with HBSS.<br>
Average neurite length per neurite was measured for each well. Figure 16 shows<br>
the results for the humanised antibodies tested in the assay. A panel of control<br>
antibodies (control IgG, purified mouse IgG; Campath and another irrelevant<br>
humanised antibodies) used to confirm the specificity of the activity. As a further<br>
control, the same humanised antibodies were titrated onto GST coated plates.<br>
The results confirm that H28L16, H27L16 and H20L16 reverse Nogo-A-mediated<br>
inhibition of neurite outgrowth to a similar degree observed for the parental<br>
antibodies (2A10 and HcLc). The effects appear to be robust and stable and<br>
were seen with H28L16 in eight out of eleven independent neurite-outgrowth<br><br>
experiments. In contrast, the humanised antibodies do not increase neurite-<br>
outgrowth on GST coated plates and the panel of control antibodies do not show<br>
any dose dependent reversal of inhibition, confirming that the effect of the<br>
humanised antibodies is specific for Nogo-A-mediated inhibition. The data<br>
presented for the neurtite outgrowth is selected from number of repeat<br>
experiments. Whilst a number of the repeats which are not shown appeared to be<br>
variable in nature, it is believed that the data shown reflects a true activity of the<br>
antibodies of the present invention in reducing the inhibitory effect of NOGO in<br>
the neurite outgrowth assay.<br>
Example 12, Further characterisation ofH28L16<br>
12.1	Binding to full-length recombinant Nogo-A<br>
The ability of the antibodies to bind full-length extracellular domain<br>
recombinant human Nogo-A (GST-human Nogo-A-ECD) was investigated by a<br>
direct binding ELISA assay. In this case the ECD was a splice variant falling<br>
within the region of approximately position 186-1004 of human NOGO A (the<br>
portion beginning DETFAL (SEQ ID NO.95) and ending with ELSKTS (SEQ ID<br>
NO.96)).<br>
The recombinant GST-human Nogo-A-ECD was directly coated to the<br>
plate at 1ug/ml. The data shown in Figure 17 confirms that H28L16 can<br>
recognise GST-human Nogo-A-ECD as levels comparable or better than the<br>
parental (HcLc) or H20L16.<br>
12.2	Inhibition of Fc functionality<br>
To improve the safety profile of the candidate, residues L235 and G237<br>
within the CH2 domain of the heavy chain constant region (EU Index system)<br>
were mutated to alanine residues thus reducing the likelihood of triggering<br>
antibody-mediated immunological effector functions. Reduced human C1q<br>
binding was used as a surrogate for inhibition of Fc functionality. Figure 18<br>
below shows that H28L16 has significantly reduced C1q binding activity,<br>
compared to Campath-lgG1 (wild-type) and comparable to a Campath lgG1<br>
construct bearing the same mutations (Fc-mutated antibody (Fc-)) and Campath<br><br>
lgG4. These data suggest that the CH2-domain mutations present in H28L16 will<br>
significantly reduce the likelihood of triggering Fc mediated effector functions.<br>
12.3 Orthologue binding<br>
To confirm that H28L16 shows binding activity to various orthologues of<br>
Nogo-A, comparable to that of the parental antibody (HcLc), a series of binding<br>
assays were performed. Figure 19 A-D below shows the results of a direct<br>
binding ELISA to recombinant NOGO (GST-human Nogo-A 56) from rat (SEQ ID<br>
NO.94), cynomolgus (SEQ ID NO. 92), marmoset (SEQ ID NO. 93) and squirrel<br>
monkey respectively (SEQ ID NO. 91). In all cases, H28L16 shows activity<br>
comparable or better than the chimeric antibody (HcLc). The calculated EC50<br>
values are very similar to those calculated for binding to human recombinant<br>
Nogo-A.<br>
The kinetics of binding of H28L16 to the various orthologues of Nogo-A in<br>
comparison to HcLc and 11C7 was determined using the Biacore. Table 18 and<br>
Table 19 below show the kinetics of binding in two different formats of the assay.<br>
Where the recombinant Nogo-A was coupled directly to the CM5 chip (Table 18),<br>
the binding kinetics for rat, cynomolgus monkey, squirrel monkey and marmoset<br>
are very similar to that for human (range = 0.33-0.67nM). When the format of<br>
the assay was reversed and the antibodies are captured onto the chip using<br>
Protein A (Table 19), the binding affinity of H28L16 to rat Nogo-A is<br>
approximately 4-fold lower than for human Nogo-A. A similar trend is observed<br>
for cynomolgus Nogo-A (8.5x lower affinity than human) and the other primate<br>
orthologues (12-17x lower affinity than human). The chimeric antibody HcLc<br>
shows a similar profile of binding to the orthologues of Nogo-A in both<br>
orientations of the assay. Since it is unclear which assay format best represents<br>
the in vivo situation, the primary conclusions that can be drawn from this study<br>
are 1) H28L16 has retained the orthologue cross-reactivity profile associated with<br>
the chimeric antibody HcLc and 2) the affinity of HcLc for rat and cynomolgus<br>
Nogo-A is within 4-fold and 8.5-fold of the affinity for human Nogo-A and under<br>
certain conditions may be very similar.<br><br>
Table 18 - Binding kinetics ofH28L16, 11C7 and HcLc to the recombinant<br>
orthologues of human Nogo-A as determined using the Biacore T100.<br>
Approximately 140-180RUs of the various Nogo-A orthologues were captured to<br>
the CM5 chip by primary amine coupling. The antibodies were flowed over a<br>
various concentrations (0.125-8nM). The values show the mean and standard<br>
deviation (in brackets) of 1-2 independent runs carried out in duplicate with each<br>
data set independently analysed prior to calculation of the mean and standard<br>
deviation. *One set of curves was discarded due to uninterprelable curves for<br>
antibody 11C7.<br><br><br>
Table 19 - Reverse format binding kinetics ofH28L16, 11C7 and HcLc to the<br>
recombinant orthologues of human Nogo-A as determined on the Biacore 7100.<br>
Protein A was immobilised on the surface at about 4000RUs and anti-Nogo-A<br>
antibodies were captured at approximately 300-400RUs. The recombinant<br>
proteins (GST- NOGO-A56) were flowed over a various concentrations (0.125-<br>
64nM) dependent on the construct. All the runs were done in duplicates. The<br>
values show the mean and standard deviation (in brackets) of 1-3 independent<br>
runs with each run done in duplicate and each data set analysed independently<br>
prior to calculation of the mean and standard deviation.<br><br>
12.4 Physical properties<br>
The physicochemical properties of H28L16 and H20L16 were assessed by<br>
SEC-HPLC and SDS-PAGE. SEC-HPLC was carried out at 1 .Oml/minute using<br>
100mM sodium phosphate, 400mM sodium chloride pH 6.8 and a TSK G3000<br>
SW xl 30cm x 7.8mm stainless steel column with detection at 214nm and 280nm.<br>
SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 4-20% Novex Tris-HCL gel loading 10ug<br>
product and staining with Sypro Ruby. C-IEF was carried out on a Beckman<br>
MDQ using pH 3.5-10 ampholines.<br><br>
The following results were obtained:<br>
Table 20 - Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) HPLC analysis of the anti-Nogo-A<br>
antibodies. The values shown are percentages of the antibody assigned to each of the<br>
three different species.<br><br>
Table 21 - SDS-PAGE analysis of the anti-Nogo-A antibodies. The values shown are<br>
percentages Of the antibody found in the major bands.<br><br>
The SEC-HPLC data suggests that H20L16 is more susceptible to<br>
aggregation than H28L16 (H28L16). If the data reported here were to be<br>
repeated at large scale, this could impact the ability of the manufacturing process<br>
to produce material of acceptable quality for clinical use (&gt;95% monomer). The<br>
SDS-PAGE data shows both candidates are acceptable with both showing a<br>
typical profile.<br>
Example 13, Comparison of H28L16 with 11C7<br>
A murine anti-Nogo-A antibody designated 11C7 is described in<br>
WO2004052932, which was raised to a peptide epitope. A chimeric 11C7 was<br>
made based on the sequence information provided in WO2004052932. To<br>
compare the binding epitopes of 2A10 and 11C7, a competition ELISA was<br><br>
established to investigate if 11C7 and 2A10 recognise an overlapping epitope on<br>
Nogo-A. As shown in Figure 20 below, HcLc (the chimeric form of 2A10) was<br>
able to compete with 2A10 for binding to human recombinant Nogo-A whereas<br>
11C7 showed no competition with 2A10, even at concentrations of up to<br>
100mcg/ml.<br>
Example 14: Competition ELISA to demonstrate the ability ofpeptides to<br>
compete directly with human NOGO-5+6 for binding to NOGO H28L16<br>
Method for competition ELISA<br>
The ability of peptides to compete directly with NOGO-A (GST-human<br>
Nogo-A56) for binding to NOGO H28L16 was assessed using a competition<br>
ELISA. Rabbit anti-human IgG (Sigma, #1-9764) at 5g/ml in bicarbonate buffer<br>
was coated onto Nunc immunosorp plates (100 ul per well) at 4°C overnight.<br>
The plates were rinsed 3 times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween (TBST) then<br>
blocked with 1% BSA in TBST at room temperature for 1 hour. H28L16 was then<br>
captured onto the plate (1ug/ml, diluted in 1% BSA in TBST, 50ul per well) at<br>
room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were washed 3 times with TBST.<br>
Peptides (from 0 to 100g/ml) and GST-human NOGO-A56 at a concentration of<br>
1ug/ml (diluted in 1% BSA in TBST) were pre-mixed prior to addition into the<br>
wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were washed 3<br>
times with TBST then incubated for 1 hour with rabbit anti-GST peroxidase<br>
conjugate (Sigma, #A7340,1:2000, diluted in 1% BSA in TBST) for 1 hour. The<br>
plates were washed 3 times with TBST and then incubated with 50 I OPD<br>
peroxidase substrate (Sigma) per well for 10 minutes. The colour reaction was<br>
stopped by the addition of 25 I concentrated H2SO4. Absorbance at 490 nm was<br>
measured using a plate reader.<br>
The results shown in Figure 21 confirm that peptides 6 and 7, which were<br>
positive in the epitope mapping ELISA (Example 8) can compete with GST-<br>
human NOGO-A56 binding to H28L16. This suggests that the peptides which<br>
were positive in the epitope mapping study contain an epitope for H28L16<br>
binding. Peptides 16 and 17 (which contain NOGO peptides, but not overlapping<br><br>
with peptides 6 or 7), which do not contain the proposed epitope, do not compete<br>
with NOGO-5+6.<br>
Example 15: ELISA analysis of a humanised Anti NOGO Monoclonal Antibody<br>
based on the NOGO antibody variant G101S/Q37R<br>
G101S (also known as H100 (SEQ ID NO.63)), a modified variant of the<br>
heavy chain variable region of H6 (SEQ ID NO.11) was generated by introducing<br>
a single substitution, G101S (Kabat numbering) into CDR H3 as described<br>
above. Similarly, Q37R, a modified variant of the light chain variable region of<br>
L13 (SEQ ID NO. 13) were generated by introducing a single substitution (Kabat<br>
numbering Q37R) into the framework region (to form L100). The protein<br>
sequence of the variable light domain Q37R is given in SEQ ID NO. 67.<br>
Genes encoding full length versions of the heavy and light chains<br>
containing the G101S/Q37R substitutions were expressed in CHO cells as<br>
described previously and assayed in a direct binding ELISA as described<br>
previously.<br>
The results of the direct binding ELISA when the antigen is loaded at<br>
0.05ug/ml are shown in Figure 22. The data confirms that antibody H100L100<br>
shows comparable binding activity to recombinant GST-human NOGO-A56 when<br>
compared with H27L16 and that H100L100 has an improved binding profile when<br>
comDared to H6L13. Corresponding EC50 values are shown in the table below:<br><br><br>
Example 16: BiaCore Analysis of humanised Anti NOGO Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
based on the CDR H3 variant G101S<br>
H100, A modified variant of the heavy chain variable region of H6 (SEQ ID<br>
NO.11) was generated by introducing a single substitution, G101S (Kabat<br>
numbering) into CDR H3. The protein sequence of the variable heavy domain<br>
H100 protein is given in SEQ ID NO.63. Similarly, L100 and L101, modified<br>
variants of the light chain variable region of L13 (SEQ ID NO. 13) were generated<br>
by introducing a single substitution (Kabat numbering Q37R and Q45R<br>
respectively) into the framework region. The protein sequences of the variable<br>
light domains L100 and L101 proteins are given in SEQ ID NO.67 and SEQ ID<br>
NO.68 respectively.<br>
Full length versions of H100L100 and H100L101 were expressed in CHO<br>
cells as described previously. Table 23 shows a comparison of the binding<br>
affinities of H6L13 with H100L100and H100L101 and indicates that H100L100<br>
and H100L101 have an improved binding affinity when compared with H6L13. In<br>
this example, the method was performed essentially as described in Example 6<br>
where the CM5 chip was activated by passing the NHS and EDC solutions over<br>
the chip at 5 I /ml for 7 minutes and the NOGO was suspended in 10nM sodium<br>
acetate buffer (pH 4.5) before passing over the chip.<br>
