Description<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL LIQUID COMPOSITION OF<br>
BOTULINUM TOXIN WITH IMPROVED STABILITY<br>
Technical Field<br>
[ 1]	The present invention relates, in general, to a more stable liquid pharmaceutical<br>
botulinum toxin composition and, more particularly, to a liquid pharmaceutical<br>
composition, comprising a botulinum toxin in combination with polysorbate 20 and<br>
methionine and optionally isoleucine.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium<br>
botulinum. This toxin blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the neu-<br>
romuscular junction, causing flaccid (sagging) paralysis of muscles in mammals. The<br>
toxin has proven to be effective for treating strabismus, idiopathic blepharospasm and<br>
hemifacial spasm. In addition, it has recently been found to provide relief for a number<br>
of motor disturbances of involuntary muscles, including spasmodic torticollis, oro-<br>
mandibular dystonia, and spasmodic dyphonia. Further, botulinum toxin received FDA<br>
approval for temporary improvement in the facial appearance of moderate-to-severe<br>
frown lines and for the non-surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm<br>
sweating).<br>
[3]	The botulinum toxin proteins serotype A and B are now formulated into dosage<br>
forms for use in medical applications such as the treatment of torticollis, ble-<br>
pharospasm, hyperhidrosis, etc. as well as in cosmetic applications such as wrinkle<br>
reduction. Protein drugs, including botulinum toxin proteins, however, suffer from<br>
many problems during the preparation thereof. The problems, most of which are<br>
attributed to protein instability, are particularly pronounced for the protein drugs which<br>
are formulated with very low concentrations of active proteins, such as botulinum<br>
toxins.<br>
[4]	Adhesing themselves ontosolid surfaces, botulinum toxin proteins, when incased in<br>
vessels, are apt to adhere to the inner walls of the vessels, resulting in a loss of the<br>
active ingredient. A stabilizing agent is also required for preventing the proteins from<br>
being oxidized or degraded into fragments.<br>
[5]	Albumin is selected in most cases for use as a stabilizer in the formulation of<br>
botulinum toxin. In addition to stabilizing the active protein ingredients in phar-<br>
maceutical compositions, albumin enjoys the advantage of showing negligible im-<br>
munogentcity even when injected into the body. However, serum products such as<br>
albumin are not completely free from the possibility of being contaminated with<br><br>
pathogens or microorganisms and thus acting as mediators of disease, particularly viral<br>
diseases or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<br>
[6]	Often, gelatin is employed in place of albumin. Gelatin, however, is recommended<br>
not to be used as a stabilizer for drug formulation because this protein, similarly to<br>
albumin, is also obtained from animals and may mediate diseases.<br>
[7]	A stabilizer derived from non-animal sources is provided for the pharmaceutical<br>
formulation of botulinum toxin by Korean Patent No. 10-0799400 in whichre-<br>
combinant serum albumin (rSA), produced in yeast, is applied for pharmaceutical<br>
formulation. However, complete avoidance cannot be provided to the possibility that a<br>
neoepitope. a new antigenic structure, may be generated in the course of the<br>
production, isolation and recovery of recombinant serum albumin (rSA), eliciting an<br>
immune response from the recipient of the drug. Korean Patent No. 10-0665469<br>
discloses a pharmaceuticalcomposition comprising a botulinum toxin, polysaccharides<br>
(including hydroxyethyl starch) and an amino acid such as lysine, glycine, histidine or<br>
arginine. This pharmaceutical composition is provided in a dosage form prepared by<br>
lyophylization and must unfortunately be stored at low-temperature in a refrigerator or<br>
freezer. The requirement that the lyophilized bolulinum toxin be thawed or diluted just<br>
before use may cause an error in the protein. In addition to being inconvenient for use,<br>
lyophilized botulinum toxins are difficult to develop into a pre-filled syringe admin-<br>
istration type.<br>
[8]	A composition for stabilization of protein agents in pharmaceuticalsis suggested by<br>
U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007-0134199. The composition comprises a non ionic<br>
detergent, preferably polysorbate, and a combination of either glutamine and glutamic<br>
acid or asparagine and aspartic acid. A dilution of botulinum toxin in the liquid<br>
composition was observed to be stable for 8 months when stored at 4°C. However,<br>
because storage at 37°C decreased the activity of the dilution within one month, the<br>
composition has limited use for the stabilization of protein agents, such as botulinum<br>
toxin, in pharmaceuticals to be stored at room temperature. This deficit is, in the<br>
opinion of the present inventors, attributed to the presence of the polar amino acids and<br>
particularly the acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[9]	Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above<br>
problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide<br>
apharmaceutical composition which can maintain the activity of botulinum toxin even<br>
after being stored for a long period of time at room temperature as well as at a re-<br>
frigerated temperature and is in a liquid form more convenient for use than a<br><br>
lyophilized form.<br>
[10]	It is another object of the present invention to provide a liquid pharmaceutical<br>
composition in which the activity of botulinum toxin can be stably maintained under a<br>
refrigerated or high temperature condition with the use of neither animal-derived<br>
protein, such as albumin or gelatin, as a stabilizer for botulinum toxin nor polar or<br>
acidic amino acids such as glutamine, glutamic acid, asparagine or aspartic acid.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[11]	Leading to the present invention, intensive and thorough research, conducted by the<br>
present inventors with many detergents and amino acids, into the stable preservation of<br>
botulinum toxin under a high-temperature condition resulted in the finding that a<br>
combination of polysorbate 20 and methionine and optionally isoleucine is able to<br>
greatly improve the stability of botulinum toxin at room temperature or higher.<br>
[12]	In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid phar-<br>
maceutical composition comprising botulinum toxin, polysorbate 20, and methionine.<br>
[13]	In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising botulinum toxin, polysorbate 20, methionine<br>
and isoleucine.<br>
[ 14]	In the liquid pharmaceutical composition, the methionine is present in an amount of<br>
0.5 to 100 umol per 100 units of botulinum toxin, and preferably ranges in con-<br>
centration from 0.5 to 100 mM and more preferably from 25 to 75 mM.<br>
[15]	In the liquid pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention,<br>
polysorbate 20 is present in an amount of 0.01 to 50 mg per 100 units of botulinum<br>
toxinand preferably ranges in concentration from 0.01 to 50 mg/mL and more<br>
preferably form 0.1 to 2.5 mg/mL.<br>
[16]	In the liquid pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, the<br>
botulinum toxin is selected from a group consisting of botulinum toxin serotypes A, B,<br>
C, D, E, F, and G and may be in a non-complex form or in a complex form with a<br>
protein. Preferably, the botulinum toxin ranges in concentration from 50 to 5,000 units/<br>
mL.<br>
[17]	The liquid pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention preferably<br>
ranges in pH from 5.5 to 7.0.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[ 18]	Employing as botulinum toxin stabilizers, instead of the animal-derived protein<br>
albumin or gelatin, a combination of polysorbate 20 and methionine, optionally with<br>
isoleucine, the liquid pharmaceuticalcomposition according to the present invention<br>
eliminates the risk of contaminating the body with serum-derived pathogens or mi-<br>
croorganisms and can be administered safely.<br><br>
[19]	In addition, the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be<br>
convenient for use as a direct injection for patients. Furthermore, as well as at re-<br>
frigerated temperatures, in terms of the storage stability of botulinum toxin at 25 ~<br>
37°C,, the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is very useful<br>
for storing botulinum toxin under an emergency condition such as an environment<br>
without maintaining low temperature, thus being superior to conventional liquid phar-<br>
maceutical compositions employing either detergents or amino acids.<br>
[20]	The liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be readily<br>
prepared because it employs a detergent and an amino acid(s) without a lyophilization<br>
process.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[21]	A liquid pharmaceutical composition with improvement in botulinum stability is<br>
provided in accordance with the present invention. Particularly, the liquid phar-<br>
maceutical composition comprises a botulinum toxin, polysorbate 20 and methionine<br>
and optionally isoleucine.<br>
[22]	The liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising a botulinum toxin, polysorbate 20<br>
and methionine, or alternatively, a botulinum toxin, polysorbate 20, methionine and<br>
isoleucine in accordance with the present invention is much improved in botulinum<br>
toxin stability.<br>
[23]	With the employment of polysorbate 20, methionine and optionally isoleucine.<br>
instead of an animal-derived protein such as albumin or gelatin, as stabilizers for<br>
botulinum toxin, the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention<br>
excludes the potential risk of infecting the recipient with serum-derived pathogens or<br>
microorganisms and is thus safe for ingestion into the body. In addition, the use of the<br>
stabilizers polysorbate 20, methionine and optionally isoleucine in combination<br>
guarantees higher stability to botulinum toxin at 25 ~ 27°C than does the use of them<br>
in a separate manner.<br>
[24]	The botulinum toxin, a constituent of the liquid pharmaceutical composition<br>
according to the present invention, may be one selected from among serotypes A, B, C,<br>
D, E, F and G. The term botulinum toxin is a generic term embracing the family of<br>
toxins produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum and, to date, seven<br>
immunologically distinct neurotoxins serotypes have been identified. These have been<br>
given the designationsA, B, C, D, E, F and G, which differ one from theother in their<br>
effects on target animals, and paralysis extent and duration. All serotypes of botulinum<br>
toxin are known to act as a neurotoxin by inhibiting the neurotransmitter acetylcholine<br>
at neuromuscular junctions.<br>
[25]	The botulinum toxin of the liquid pharmaceutical composition according to the<br><br>
present invention may be in a non-complex form or in a complex form with another<br>
protein. Botulinum toxin serotype A, B, C, D, E. F or G alone, synthesized by<br>
Clostridium botulinum, itself has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. When<br>
expressed in Clostridium botulinum, the botulinum toxin forms various complexes<br>
with hemagglutinin proteins and non-hemagglutinin proteins which aid and protect the<br>
activity thereof. Naturally occurring botulinum type A complexes have a molecular<br>
weight of approximately 900 kDa, 500 kDa or 300 kDa. Molecular weights are<br>
measured to be approximately 500 kDa for botulinum toxin type B complexes and type<br>
C complexes, approximately 300 kDa or 500 kDa for type D complexes, and ap-<br>
proximately 300 kDa for type E and type F complexes.<br>
[26]	Although not severely restricted, the concentration of the botulinum toxin in the<br>
liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention preferably ranges from 50<br>
to 5,000 units/mL depending on the general use thereof.<br>
[27]	Methionine is present in an amount from 0.5 to 100 µmol per 100 units of botulinum<br>
toxin.and preferably ranges in concentration from 0.5 to 100 mM and more preferably<br>
from 25 to 75 mM in the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.<br>
[28]	One unit (U) of botulinum toxin is defined as the LD upon intraperitoneal injection<br>
into female Swiss Webster mice weighing 18-20 grams each. The LD50 of botulinum<br>
toxin in mice corresponds to about 50 picograms.<br>
[29]	A methionine content less than 0.5 µmol per 100 units of botulinum toxin cannot<br>
guarantee the stabilization of the botolinum toxin to a desirable level upon long-term<br>
storage at room temperature. On the other hand, when methionine is used in an amount<br>
exceeding 100 µmol per 100 units of botulinum toxin, the excess increment may not<br>
promise an additional stabilization effect in addition to incurring an economic dis-<br>
advantage. In the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention,<br>
methionine properly ranges in concentration from 0.5 to 100 mM when the botulinum<br>
toxin has a concentration of 100 units/mL. Its proper concentration is adjusted to 25 ~<br>
75 mM in consideration of the concentration range of polysorbate 20. When the con-<br>
centration of methionine is below 25 mM in the liquid pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the present invention, its long-term stabilization effect on botulinum toxin at room<br>
temperature does not reach the desirable level, which is obtainable in the proper con-<br>
centration range of botulinum toxin. On the other hand, a methionine concentration<br>
exceeding 75 mM does not provide any additional effect.<br>
[30]	In the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, polysorbate 20 is<br>
present in an amount of 0.01 to 50 mg per 100 units of botulinum toxin and preferably<br>
ranges in concentration from 0.01 to 50 mg/mL and more preferably form 0.1 to 2.5<br>
mg/mL.<br>
[31]	Polysorbates are a class of emulsifiers used in some pharmaceuticals and in food<br><br>
preparation. They are often used in cosmetics to dissolve essential oils into water-<br>
based (oil-in-water) products. There are many kinds of polysorbatesthat are classified<br>
by a number referring to the total number of oxyethylene groups, such as polysorbate<br>
20, 40, 60 and 80. The liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention<br>
employs polysorbate 20 (commercially available as brand name Tween 20) as a<br>
stabilizer for bolulinum toxin.<br>
[32]	If the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention contains<br>
polysorbate 20 in an amount less than 0.01 mg per 100 units of botulinum toxin, its<br>
long-term stabilization effect on botulinum toxin at room temperature does not reach a<br>
desirable level. On the other hand, a polysorbate 20 concentration exceeding 50 mg/<br>
mL does not provide any additional effect in addition to incurring an economic dis-<br>
advantage. At a concentration of 100 units/mL of botulinum toxin in the liquid phar-<br>
maceutical composition of the present invention, polysorbate 20 is properly present in<br>
an amount of 0.01 -50 mg/mL and preferably in an amount of 0.1-2.5 mg/mL when<br>
the methionine concentration is taken into consideration. When the concentration of<br>
polysorbate 20 in the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is less<br>
than 0.1 mg/mL, its long-term stabilization effect on botulinum toxin at room<br>
temperature does not reach a desired level, which is obtainable by the target con-<br>
centration of polysorbate 20. On the other hand, a polysorbate 20 concentration<br>
exceeding 2.5 mg/mL does not provide any additional effect.<br>
[33]	In accordance with the present invention, the liquid pharmaceutical composition has<br>
a pH of 5.5 - 7.0. In the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention<br>
adjusted to a pH of 5.5 - 7.0, botulinum toxin is stably maintained at room temperature<br>
(particularly 40°C) for a long period of time.<br>
Mode for the Invention<br>
[34]	A better understanding of the present invention may be obtained through the<br>
following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed as the<br>
limit of the present invention.<br>
[35]<br>
[36]	1. Experiment Method<br>
[37]	(1) Preparation of liquid botulinum toxin composition<br>
[38]	A botulinum toxin was diluted to a final concentration of 100 units/mL in a<br>
stabilizing solution.<br>
[39]	(2) Stability assay of botulinum toxin<br>
[40]	While the prepared liquid botulinum toxin composition was stored at a certain<br>
temperature, samples of 1 mL were taken therefrom at predetermined intervals. 1 mL<br>
of the sampled liquid composition was 10-fold diluted using 9 mL of an injection<br><br>
solution. The diluted sample was intraperitoneally injected into five female ICRmice<br>
(Institute of Cancer Research, USA) (at a dose of 0.3 mL per mouse, that is, 3 units/<br>
mouse). While the mice were observed 3 days after the intraperitoneal injection, the<br>
death toll and mortalityrate were analyzed. The liquid botulinum toxin composition<br>
was evaluated for maintenance of the activity of botulinum toxin when the mortality<br>
rate was 50% or higher.<br>
[41]<br>
[42]	2. Selection of botulinum toxin stabilizer<br>
[43]	liquid botulinum toxin compositions containing Various candidates of botulinum<br>
toxin stabilizer were prepared and analyzed for botulinum toxin stability over time<br>
during storage at 25°C or 37°C. Results of the stability experiments at 25°C and 37°C<br>
are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. In Tables 1 and 2, HSA stands for<br>
human serum albumin and PEG8000 represents polyethylene glycol 8000.<br>
[44]	At 25°C, as seen in Table 1, the activity of botulinum toxin was maintained for a<br>
long period of time in a liquid composition comprising L-methione(20mM) +<br>
polysorbate 20(2mg/mL) + botulinum toxin(100 units/mL), HS A(5 mg/mL) +<br>
polysorbate 20(2mg/mL) + botulinum toxin( 100 units/mL), L-<br>
IsoLeucine(50mM)+polysorbate 20(2mg/mL)+botulinum toxin(100 units/mL), a hy-<br>
droxyethyl starch( 10mg/mL)+polysorbate 20(2mg/mL)+botulinum toxinl 100 units/<br>
mL). At 37°C, the liquid composition comprising L-methione(20mM)+polysorbate<br>
20(2mg/rnL)+botulinum toxin(l00 units/mL) or HSA(5mg/mL)+polysorbate<br>
20(2mg/mL)+botulinum toxin(100 units/mL) was found to maintain the activity of<br>
botulinum toxin for a long period of time as seen in Table 2.<br>
[45]	From the results, it is recognized that a combination of methionine and polysorbate<br>
20 acts as a stabilizer substitutable for a combination of HAS and polysorbate 20 or a<br>
combination of hydroxyethyl starch and polysorbate 20. Also, a combination of<br>
isoleucine and polysorbate 20 emerged as a stabilizer candidate substitutable for con-<br>
ventional stabilizers.<br><br><br><br><br>
[48]<br>
[49]	3. Stability of botulinum toxin at various concentrations of methionine<br>
[50]	Liquid botulinum toxin compositions comprising various concentrations of<br>
methionine in combination with polysorbate 20 as botulinum toxin stabilizers were<br>
assayed for ability to maintain the activity of botulinum toxin under a 37°C storage<br>
condition. The experimental results of the stability of botulinum toxin according to a<br>
change in methionine concentration are summarized in Table 3, below.<br><br><br>
[52]	As seen in Table 3, the activity of botulinum toxin was stably maintained for 56 days<br>
at a methionine concentration of 0.5~20 mM and for 70 days at a methionine con-<br>
centration of 50~ 100 mM. The composition employing both methionine and<br>
polysorbate 20 greatly improved the stability of botulinum toxin as compared with the<br>
composition employing polysorbate 20 alone.<br>
[53]<br>
[54]	4. Stability of botulinum toxin at various concentrations of polysorbate 20<br>
[55]	Liquid botulinum toxin compositions comprising methionine in combination with<br>
various concentrations of polysorbate 20 as botulinum toxin stabilizers were assayed<br>
for ability to maintain the activity of botulinum toxin under a 37°C storage condition.<br>
The experimental results of the stability of botulinum toxin according to a change in<br>
polysorbate concentration are summarized in Table 4, below.<br><br>
[57]	As seen in Table 4, the activity of botulinum toxin was stably maintained for 202<br>
days at a polysorbate 20 concentrations of 0.5-2.0 mg/mL, for 167 days at a<br><br>
polysorbate 20 concentration of 0.01 mg/mL and for 120 days at a polysorbate 20 con-<br>
centration of 10 mg/mL. The composition employing both methionine and polysorbate<br>
20 was greatly improved in the stability of botulinum toxin as compared with the<br>
composition employing methionine alone.<br>
[58]<br>
[59]	5. Stability of botulinum toxin at various concentrations of methionine and<br>
polysorbate 20<br>
[601	Liquid botulinum toxin compositions comprising various concentrations of a<br>
combination of methionine and polysorbate 20 as botulinum toxin stabilizers were<br>
assayed for their ability to maintain the activity of botulinum toxin under a 37°C<br>
storage condition. The experimental results (mortality rate, %)of the stability of<br>
botulinum toxin after storage for 30 and 60 days at various concentrations of<br>
methionine and polysorbate 20 (Example 12) are summarized in Tables 5 and 6, re-<br>
spectively. In the liquid botulinum toxin compositions used in the experiments,<br>
botulinum toxin had a concentration of 100 units/mL.<br>
[61 ]	Statistical analysis of the data of Tables 5 and 6 suggests that a combination of 25-75<br>
mM of methionine and 0.1-2.5 mg/mL of polysorbate 20 stabilize botulinum toxin at<br>
highest efficiency.<br><br><br>
[65]	6. Stability of botulinum toxin in liquid botulinum toxin compositions with various<br>
PHS<br>
[66]	Various liquid botulinum toxin compositions (Example 13)with a pH of 5.5-7.0, in<br>
which methionine and polysorbate 20 were combined in their respective concentration<br>
ranges optimal for the stabilization of botulinum toxin, were prepared and assayed for<br>
ability to maintain the activity of botulinum toxin under a 40°C storage condition. The<br>
pH of the liquid botulinum toxin compositions was adjusted with HCl or NaOH. Each<br>
of the compositions had a botulinum toxin concentration of 100 units/mL. The results<br>
of the stability of botulinum toxin according to the pH of the liquid composition are<br>
summarized in Table 7, below.<br>
[67]	As seen in FIG. 7, the activity of botulinum toxin was stably maintained for 90 days<br>
in liquid botulinum toxin compositions containing of 25~75 mM of methionine in<br>
combination with 0.25~0.75 mg/mL of polysorbate 20 with the pH thereof ranging<br>
from 5.5 to 7.0 under a 40°C storage condition.<br><br><br>
[69]<br>
[70]	7. Stability of botulinum toxin in liquid pharmaceutical composition containing a<br>
combination of methionine, isoleucine and polysorbate<br>
[71]	As described above, a combination of isoleucine and polysorbate 20 as well as a<br>
combination of methione and polysorbate 20 was identified as a candidate for<br><br>
stabilizing botulinum toxin. On the basis of this result, a combination of methionine,<br>
isoleucine and polysorbate 20 was assayed for ability to stabilize botulinum toxin<br>
under a 37°C storage condition. In the liquid composition, botulinum toxin had a con-<br>
centration of 100 units/mL.<br><br>
[73]	As seen in FIG. 8, the activity of botulinum toxin was maintained for a long period of<br>
time (approximately 200 days) under a 37°C storage condition by a combination of<br>
methionine, isoleucine and polysorbate 20, but was found to almost disappear before<br>
the lapse of 30 days in the liquid compositions containing isoleucine alone or in<br>
combination with methionine or polysorbate 20.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[74]	As described hitherto, the liquid pharmaceutical botulinum toxincomposition<br>
according to the present invention shows greatly improved botulinum toxin stability. It<br>
is useful in the treatment of dystonia, stiff muscle spasm,neurological disorders<br>
(migraine, lumbago, cervical spinal disorder, etc.) as well as in the cosmetic ap-<br>
plication for hyperhidrosis treatment and wrinkle reduction. In addition, the liquid<br>
pharmaceutical botulinum toxin composition of the present invention may be directly<br>
used as an injection and guarantees the activity of botulinum toxin for a long period of<br>
time even at 25 ~ 37°C as well as at a refrigerated temperature, which is very ad-<br>
vantageous for transportation and sale.<br><br>

Disclosed herein is a liquid pharmaceutical composition of botulinum toxin which is improved in stability. It comprises botulinum toxin, polysorbate 20, and methionine and optionally isoleucine. Employing, instead of theanimal-derived protein<br>
albumin or gelatin, a combination of polysorbate 20 and methionine and optionally isoleucine as botulinum toxin stabilizers, the<br>
liquid pharmaceutical composition eliminates the risk of contaminating the body with serum- derived pathogens or microorganisms<br>
and can be administered safely to the body. Also, the composition is convenient for use as a direct injection for patients. Superior<br>
to conventional compositions employing either detergents or amino acids in terms of the storage stability of botulinum toxin at 25<br>
- 370C as well as at refrigerated temperatures, the liquid pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is very useful for<br>
storing botulinum toxin under an emergency condition such as an environment without maintaining low temperature. The liquid<br>
pharmaceutical composition can be readily prepared because it employs a detergent and an amino acid(s) without a lyophilization<br>
 process.<br></td>
