"TRI (CYCLO) SUBSTITUTED AMIDE COMPOUNDS"<br>
PROSIDION LIMITED, Windrush Court, Watlington Road, Oxford OX4 6LT, Great Britain,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the  invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to tri(cyclo) substituted amide compounds. In particular, the present invention is directed to amide compounds substituted i) at the carbonyl carbon with an ethyl/ethenyl attached to a phenyl ring and an aryl/heteroaryl/heterocyclic ring, and ii) at the amino with a nitrogen bearing heteroaryl ring, which are modulators of glucokinase and are useful in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of hyperglycemia and type II diabetes.<br>
Glucokinase ("GK") is believed to be important in the body"s regulation of its plasma glucose level. GK, found principally in the liver and pancreas, is one of four hexokinases that catalyze the initial metabolism of glucose. The GK pathway is saturated at higher glucose levels than the other hexokinase pathways (See R.L. Printz et al., Annu. Rev. Nutr., 13:463-496(1993)). GK is critical to maintaining the glucose balance in mammals. Animals that do not express GK die soon after birth with diabetes, while animals that overexpress GK have improved glucose tolerance. Activation of GK can lead to hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. (See, for example, H.B.T. Christesen et al., Diabetes, 51:1240-1246(2002)). Additionally, type H maturity-onset diabetes of the young is caused by the loss of function mutations in the GK gene, suggesting that GK operates as a glucose sensor in humans. (Y. Liang et al., Biochem. J. 309:167-173(1995)). Thus, compounds that activate GK increase the sensitivity of the GK sensory system and would be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia - particularly the hyperglycemia associated with type II diabetes. It is therefore desirable to provide novel compounds that activate GK to treat diabetes.<br>

While the preferred groups for each variable have generally been listed above separately for each variable, preferred compounds of this invention include those in which several or each variable in Formula (I) is selected from the preferred, more preferred, most preferred, especially or particularly listed groups for each variable. Therefore, this invention is intended to include all combinations of preferred, more preferred, most preferred, especially and particularly listed groups.<br>
As used herein, unless stated otherwise, "alky!" as well as other groups having the prefix "alk" such as, for example, alkoxy, alkanyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and the like, means carbon chains which may be linear or branched or combinations thereof. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-and tert-butyl, pentyl, hcxyl, heptyl and the like. "Alkenyl", "alkynyl" and other like terms include carbon chains having at least one unsaturated carbon-carbon bond.<br>
As used herein, for example, "Ctualkyl" is used to mean an alkyl having 0-4 carbons - that is, 0,1, 2, 3, or 4 carbons in a straight or branched configuration. An alkyl having no carbon is hydrogen when the alkyl is a terminal group. An alkyl having no carbon is a direct bond when the alkyl is a bridging (connecting) group.<br>
The terms "cycloalkyl" and "carbocyclic ring" mean carbocycles containing no heteroatoms, and include mono-, bi-, and tricyclic saturated carbocycles, as well as fused and bridged systems, Such fused ring systems can include one ring that is partially or fully unsaturated, such as a benzene ring, to form fused ring systems, such as benzoiused carbocycles. Cycloalkyl includes such fused ring systems as spirofused<br><br>
ring systems. Examples of cycloalkyl and carbocyclic rings include lycloalkyl such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and decahydronaphthalene, adamantane, indanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and the like.<br>
The term "halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms. The terra "aryl" includes, for example, phenyl and naphthyl. Unless otherwise stated, the term "heterocyclic ring" includes 4-8-membered saturated rings containing one or two heteroatoms chosen from oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. The heteroatoms are not directly attached to one another. Examples of heterocyclic rings include oxetane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, oxepane, oxocane, thietane, tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyran, thiepane, thiocane, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, azepane, azocane, [l,3]dioxane, oxazolidine, piperazine, and the like. Other examples of heterocyclic rings include the oxidised forms of the sulfur-containing rings. Thus, tetrahydrothiophene 1-oxide, tetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide, tetrahydrothiopyran 1-oxide, and tetrahydrothiopyran 1,1-dioxide are also considered to be heterocyclic rings.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the term "heteroaryl" includes 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl rings containing 1-4 heteroatoms chosen from oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. Examples of such heteroaryl rings are furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, triazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, and triazinyl.<br>
The above formulas are shown without a definitive stereochemistry at certain positions. The present invention includes all stereoisomers (e.g. geometric isomers, optical isomers, diastereoisomers, etc.) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, except where specifically drawn or stated otherwise. Further, mixtures of stereoisomers as well as isolated specific stereoisomers are also included, except where specifically drawn or stated otherwise.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients or adjuvants. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous) administration, as well as administration through inhaling, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the particular host, and nature and severity of the conditions for which the active ingredient is being administered. The pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are preferably adapted for oral administration.<br>
In practice, the compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g. oral or parenteral (including intravenous). Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be presented as discrete units suitable for oral administration such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further, the compositions can be presented as a powder, as granules, as a solution, as a suspension in an aqueous liquid, as a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water emulsion, or as a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compound represented by Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices. The compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation.<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include a pharmaceutically acceptable liposomal formulation containing a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be, for example, a solid, liquid, or gas. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are<br><br><br>
sugar syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, and water. Examples of gaseous carriers include carbon dioxide and nitrogen.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any convenient pharmaceutical media may be employed. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like may be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; while carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like may be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules are the preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Optionally, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
A tablet containing the composition of this invention may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or adjuvants. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent or other such excipient. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, com starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer time. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be used.<br>
In hard gelatin capsules, the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. In soft gelatin capsules, the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Each tablet preferably contains from about 0.05mg to about 5g of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule preferably containing from about 0.05mg to about 5g of the active ingredient.<br><br>
For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5mg to about 5g of active agent, compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about lmg to about 2g of the active ingredient, typically 25mg, 50mg, l00mg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 500mg, 600mg, 800mg, or l000mg.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Further, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage; thus, preferably should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, dusting powder, or the like. Further, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared, utilizing a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by admixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5wt% to about 10wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid. It is preferable that the mixture forms unit dose suppositories, Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories may be conveniently formed<br><br><br>
by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in molds.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for inhaled administration. Such administration can be in forms and utilizing carriers described in, for example, 1) Particulate Interactions in Dry Powder Formulations for Inhalation. Xian Zeng et al, 2000, Taylor and Francis, 2) Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology. Anthony Hickey, 1992, Marcel Dekker, 3) Respiratory Drue Delivery. 1990, Editor: P.R. Byron, CRC Press.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical compositions described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including anti-oxidants) and the like. Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Compositions containing a compound of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form.<br>
Generally, dosage levels on the order of from about 0.0lmg/kg to about 150mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about lOg per patient per day. For example, diabetes may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0,01 to 1 OOmg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about Q.5mg to about 7g per patient per day.<br>
It is understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the disease in the particular diabetic patient undergoing tlierapy. Further, it is understood that the compounds and salts thereof of this invention can be administered at subtherapeutic levels prophylactically in anticipation of a hyperglycemic condition.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may exhibit advantageous properties compared to known glucokinase activators, e.g. as illustrated in the assays described herein. In particular compounds of the invention may exhibit improved values for Km, Vmax, EC50, maximum activation (glucose concentration = 5mM), and/or maximum blood<br><br>
glucose reduction on basal blood glucose levels (e.g. in C57BL/6J mice), or other advantageous pharmacological properties, compared to known GK activators<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
In accordance with this invention, the compounds of Formula (la) can be prepared following the protocol illustrated in Scheme 1 below:<br>
SCHEME 1<br><br>
wherein Q, T, R1-R6, m and A are as described above, and R11 is Qualkyl.<br>
The aldehydes II and phenylacetic acids or esters III are commercially available or are readily prepared using known techniques. When Q represents an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring, IV may be prepared by the Perkin reaction (G. Karminski-Zamola et al., Tetrahedron 1982,38,1329-1335), In this reaction, II is condensed with the phenylacetic acid III = Coalkyl) in the presence of a carboxylic acid anhydride, e.g. acetic anhydride, and a tertiary amine base, e.g. triethylamine, at reflux to give the acrylic acid IV. Alternatively, IV may be prepared through the condensation of II and III = Coalkyl) under the influence of an amine base, such as piperidine, in toluene under reflux (D. Deschenes et al., WO 01/46151), When Q is a heterocyclic ring, the sarbanion of the phenylacetic ester III  4allcyl), generated at -78°C in, for example, tetrahydrofuran, by a strong base, e.g. lithium diisopropylaraide, may be condensed with II to give an -unsaturated ester (T. Severin et al. Chem. Ber. 1985,118,4760-4773) that may be saponified using, for example, sodium hydroxide (W. L. Corbett et al., WO 01/44216), to produce IV.<br>
The unsaturated carboxylic acids IV may be condensed with heteroaromatic amines V, many of which are commercially available, using a variety of coupling conditions, e.g. polymer supported carbodiimide-1-hydroxybenzotriazole in N,N-dimethylformamide at 20°C (for representative procedures, see<br>

http://www.argotech.com/PDF/resins/ps_carbodiimide.pdf and available from Argonaut Technologies, Inc., Foster City, California), to give (la).<br>
The compounds of Formula (lb) can be made by the route displayed in Scheme 2 below:<br>
SCHEME 2<br><br><br><br>
R8     VII<br>
wherein and m are as described above, V is CO2R11 or<br>
  and X is chloro, bromo, iodo, wherein R11 is as described<br>
above and R12 is alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more fluorines, or optionally substituted aryl.<br>
The halides and sulfonate esters VI are commercially available or are readily prepared using known techniques. These alkylating agents may be reacted with the dianions of the phenylacetic acids VII, generated at -78°C in tetrahydrofuran with &gt;2 equivalents of a strong base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, to generate VIII directly (F. T. Bizzarro et al„ WO 00/58293). Alternatively, the a-carbanion of phenylacetic ester VII, generated at -78°C in tetrahydrofuran by a strong base, such as lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (L. Snyder et al., J. Org. Chem, 1994, 59, 7033-7037), can be alkylated by VI to give substituted esters. Saponification of these esters, employing, for example, sodium hydroxide in aqueous methanol at 20qC to reflux, leads to the carboxylic acids VIII.<br>
The carboxylic acids VIII may be condensed with heteroaroraatic amines V using a variety of coupling conditions, e.g. polymer supported carbodiimide-1-hydroxybenzotriazole in N,N-dimethylformamide at 20°C (for representative procedures, see http://www.argotech.com/PDF/resins/ps_carbodiimide.pdfand available from Argonaut Technologies, Inc., Foster City, California), to give amides (lb).<br><br>
The compound of Formula (lb) has an asymmetric carbon atom which interlinks the amide carbonyl carbon, the aryl ring, and the Q-containing sidechain. In accordance with this invention, the preferred stereoconfiguration at the asymmetric centre is (R).<br>
If one desires to isolate the pure (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers of the compound of Formula (lb), it is possible to resolve a racemic mixture of the chiral carboxylic acid precursor VIII by any conventional chemical means and then condense the enantiopure carboxylic acids with an amine of formula V using a reagent that causes negligible racemisation. By way of illustration, racemic VIII can be condensed with a chiral oxazolidinone derivative (see, for instance, F. T. Bizzarre- et al. WO 00/58293) to generate a mixture of diastereoisomeric imides that are separable by any conventional method, e.g. column chromatography. Hydrolysis of the pure imides affords the stereopure (R)- and (iS)-carboxylic acids that can then be condensed with heterocyclic amines V, employing a reagent that minimises racemisation of the chiral centre, e.g. benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(pyn-olidino)phosphonium hexafiuorophosphate (J. Coste et al. Tetrahedron Lett, 1990, 31, 205-208), to furnish enantiopure (R)~ or (iS)-amides of Formula (lb). Alternatively, a racemic mixture of amides of Formula (lb) can be separated by means of chiral high performance liquid chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase which can be purchased from, for example, Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.<br>

Compound libraries may be prepared by a combinatorial "split and mix" approach or by multiple parallel synthesis using either solution or solid phase chemistry, using procedures known to those skilled in the art.<br>
During the synthesis of the compounds of Formula (I), labile functional groups in the intermediate compounds, e.g. hydroxy, carboxy and amino groups, may be protected. The protecting groups may be removed at any stage in the synthesis of the compounds of Formula (I) or may be present on the final compound of Formula (I). A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which various labile functional groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given<br><br><br>

ASSAYS<br>
In vitro GK activity<br>
Using a protocol similar to that described in WO 00/58293, GK activity was assayed by coupling the production of G6P by GST-GK to the generation of NADPH with G6PDH as the coupling enzyme.<br><br><br>
The GK assay was performed at 30°C in a flat bottom 96-well assay plate from Costar with a final incubation volume of 100/uL, The assay buffer contained: 25mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 12.5mM KC1, 5mM D-Glc, 5mM ATP, 6.25mM NADP, 25mM MgCl2, ImM dithiothreitol, test compound or 5% DMSO, 3.0unit/mL G6PDH, and 0.4 uL/mL GST-GK, derived from human liver GK. ATP, G6PDH, and NADP were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. The other reagents were &gt;98% pure and were purchased from Kanto Chemicals. The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO, before being added to the assay buffer without ATP. This mix was preincubated in the temperature controlled chamber of a SPECTRAmax 250 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) for 1 Omin, then the reaction was started by the addition of 10μL ATP solution.<br>
After starting the reaction, the increase in optical density (OD) at 340nm was monitored over a 1 Omin incubation period as a measure of GK activity. Sufficient GST-GK was added to produce an increase in OD340 over the 10min incubation period in wells containing 5% DMSO, but no test compound. Preliminary experiments established that the GK reaction was linear over this period of time, even in the presence of activators that produced a 8-fold increase in GK activity. The GK activity in control wells was compared with the activity in wells containing test GK activators. The compound concentrations that produced a 50% increase in GK activity (i.e. FA1.5) were calculated. GK activators achieved FA1.5 at S 30μM.<br>

In vivo GK activity<br>
Following an 18h fasting period, C57BU6J mice were dosed orally via gavage with GK activator at 50mg/kg body weight. Blood Glc determinations were made 5 times during the 6h post-dose study period.<br>
Mice (n = 5) were weighed and fasted for 18h before oral treatment, GK activators were dissolved in the Gelucire vehicle reported in WO 00/58293 (EtOH:Gelucire44/14:PEG400q.s. 4:66:30 v/v/v) at a concentration of 13.3mg/mL. Mice were dosed orally with 7.5mL formulation per kg of body weight to equal a 50mg/kg dose. Immediately prior to dosing, a pre-dose (time zero) blood Glc reading<br><br><br>
was acquired by snipping off a small portion of the animals" tails (<lmm and collecting blood for analysis. after gk activator treatment further glc readings were taken at post-dose from the same tail wound results interpreted by comparing mean values of vehicle treated mice with over study duration. compounds are considered active when they exhibit a statistically significant decrease in compared to consecutive assay time points.></lmm>
Several of the GK activators exemplified above showed strong GK activator effects in vivo when administered orally following the abovementioned protocol.<br>4  -<br><br><br>
