				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMBINATION WEIGHER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]    The present invention relates to a combination weigher which feeds to a<br>
packaging machine or the like, objects to be weighed which have been weighed.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]      Objects to be weighed, such as detergents and confectionary, which have been<br>
weighed to have specified weight by a combination weigher, are typically packaged by a<br>
packaging machine.    A schematic construction of a first conventional example of such a<br>
combination weigher which weighs the objects to be weighed is shown in Fig. 12.<br>
[0003]    The combination weigher of Fig. 12 is configured such that a control unit 30<br>
controls an operation of the entire combination weigher and performs combination<br>
calculation.    The combination weigher is constructed in such a manner that a center<br>
base body (body) 5 is disposed at a center of the combination weigher, and a dispersion<br>
feeder 1 having a conical shape is mounted to an upper part of the center base body<br>
(body) 5 to radially disperse objects to be weighed supplied from an external supplying<br>
device by vibration.    Around the dispersion feeder 1, linear feeders 2 are provided to<br>
transfer the objects to be weighed which have been sent from the dispersion feeder 1 into<br>
respective feeding hoppers 3 by vibration.    A plurality of feeding hoppers 3 and<br>
weighing hoppers 4 are disposed below the linear feeders 2 and are arranged in a circular<br>
shape in such a manner that each feeding hopper 3 and each weighing hopper 4<br>
correspond to the associated one of the linear feeders 2.    The feeding hopper 3 receives<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been sent from the linear feeder 2, and opens its<br>
gate to feed the objects to be weighed to the weighing hopper 4 located therebelow when<br>
the weighing hopper 4 becomes empty.    The weighing hopper 4 is attached with a<br>
weight sensor 41 such as a load cell.    The weight sensor 41 measures the weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed inside the weighing hopper 4.    The control unit 30 performs<br><br>
combination calculation to select a combination made up of hoppers which will discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed, from the plurality of weighing hoppers 4.    The weighing<br>
hoppers 4 corresponding to the combination discharge the objects to be weighed onto a<br>
collecting chute 6.    The collecting chute 6 is disposed below the weighing hoppers 4.<br>
The objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4<br>
slide down on the collecting chute 6 and are discharged from a discharge outlet at a<br>
bottom part of the collecting chute 6.    The objects to be weighed are sent out to a<br>
packaging machine which is not shown.    While manufacturing package bags, the<br>
packaging machine charges the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
the combination weigher into the package bags and packages them.<br>
[0004J    In order to increase a productivity (total number of times the objects to be<br>
weighed are discharged from the combination weigher to the packaging machine) within<br>
a specified time, it is necessary to shorten a discharge cycle time.    To this end,<br>
conventionally, the number of weighing hoppers was increased to a certain degree to<br>
configure so that a double shift operation is carried out rather than a single shift<br>
operation, and thus the discharge cycle time taken for the single shift operation is<br>
reduced by half.    The single shift operation is carried out in a configuration in which,<br>
for example, a total number of the weighing hoppers 4 is set to ten, the number of the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of a combination is set to four, the combination<br>
calculation is performed once within one weighing cycle time, the weighing hoppers 4<br>
perform discharge operation once within one weighing cycle time, and the collecting<br>
hopper 7 performs discharge operation with respect to the packaging machine once<br>
within one weighing cycle time.    In order to achieve weighing precision substantially as<br>
high as that in the single shift operation when the double shift operation is carried out,<br>
the number of the weighing hoppers 4 is increased by four so that a total number of them<br>
is fourteen and the number of the weighing hoppers 4 to be selected to make up of the<br>
combination is set to four.    And, the combination calculation is performed once in every<br>
1/2 of one weighing cycle time, and weighing hoppers 4 making up of a combination<br><br>
selected in the combination calculation discharge the objects to be weighed.    In this case,<br>
since the combination calculation is performed twice within one weighing cycle time,<br>
and the weighing hoppers 4 performs the discharge operation twice within one weighing<br>
cycle time, high-speed discharge operation is achieved, and the productivity is improved.<br>
[0005]    However, even when the combination weigher shown in Fig. 12 is configured to<br>
carry out the double shift operation, the speed of the objects to be weighed which have<br>
been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 and slide down on the collecting chute 6<br>
does not increase.    For this reason, on the collecting chute, a distance between a batch<br>
of the objects to be weighed discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up<br>
of a previous combination and a batch of the objects to be weighed discharged from the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of a subsequent combination is insufficient and<br>
the objects to be weighed in the previous and subsequent combinations are likely to be<br>
mixed, making it difficult to carry out the high-speed discharge operation.    To solve this<br>
problem, two collecting chutes may be provided as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[0006]    Fig. 13(a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view showing a second example<br>
of the conventional combination weigher as viewed from laterally.    Fig. 13(b) is a<br>
schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chute and outer chute) and weighing hoppers<br>
of the combination weigher as viewed from above.    The combination weigher is<br>
configured in such a manner that a lower chute is incorporated into the combination<br>
weigher disclosed in a patent document 1 to discharge objects to be weighed into a<br>
packaging machine having one inlet.<br>
[0007]    In the combination weigher, two collecting chutes, i.e., an inner chute 6g and an<br>
outer chute 6h are provided, and each weighing hopper 4 has two gates (not shown) to be<br>
able to discharge objects to be weighed selectively to the inner chute 6g or to the outer<br>
chute 6h which is located therebelow.    In addition, a collecting hopper 7g is provided at<br>
a discharge outlet 6ge provided at a bottom part of the inner chute 6g to hold and<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed, while a collecting hopper 7h is provided at a<br>
discharge outlet 6he at a bottom part of the outer chute 6h to hold and discharge the<br><br>
objects to be weighed.    Furthermore, one lower chute 8 is provided below the two<br>
collecting hoppers 7g and 7h to feed the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the collecting hoppers 7g and 7h into one inlet of the packaging machine.<br>
A control unit 31 controls an operation of the entire combination weigher and performs<br>
combination calculation.    The combination weigher is configured to carry out the<br>
double shift operation in such a manner that the weighing hoppers 4 selected sequentially<br>
to make up of the combinations discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to the<br>
inner chute 6g and to the outer chute 6h and the collecting hopper 7g and the collecting<br>
hopper 7h alternately discharge the objects to be weighed to the lower chute 8.    Thereby,<br>
the objects to be weighed are discharged twice from the discharge outlet 8a of the lower<br>
chute 8 within one weighing cycle time.    So, the high-speed operation is achieved.<br>
Also, since the weighing hoppers 4 discharge the objects to be weighed to each of the<br>
inner chute 6g and the outer chute 6h only once within one weighing cycle time, a<br>
sufficient distance can be provided between a batch of the objects to be weighed which<br>
are discharged previously and a batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
subsequently on each of the chutes.<br>
[0008]      In cases where the combination weigher is not equipped with the lower chute 8,<br>
two packaging machines or a twin-inlet packaging machine having two inlets are/is<br>
disposed below the combination weigher, and the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the collecting hoppers 7g and 7h are fed into the associated packaging<br>
machine inlets.    In this case, by the double shift operation, the objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged once to each of the two packaging machine inlets within one weighing cycle<br>
time.    That is, the objects to be weighed are discharged twice in total within one<br>
weighing cycle time irrespective of the presence or absence of the lower chute 8.    Thus,<br>
a productivity within a specified time period can be improved.<br>
Patent document 2 discloses a configuration of a combination weigher which is<br>
capable of carrying out a combination discharge operation at a higher speed.    In this<br>
configuration, a funnel-shaped inner chute is disposed below weighing hoppers and right<br><br>
and left outer chutes are disposed to surround the inner chute.    Intermediate hoppers are<br>
respectively provided at discharge outlets at bottom parts of these three chutes.<br>
Furthermore, three first timing hoppers are disposed below the three intermediate<br>
hoppers to discharge the objects to be weighed to a first lower chute and three second<br>
timing hoppers are disposed below the three intermediate hoppers to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to a second lower chute.    The objects to be weighed can be fed<br>
from the first and second lower chutes to the two packaging machines or the twin-inlet<br>
packaging machine.    In this case, a combination for discharging the objects to be<br>
weighed to the right outer chute is determined by selecting weighing hoppers from those<br>
belonging to a right group, a combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the<br>
left outer chute is determined by selecting weighing hoppers from those belonging to a<br>
left group, and a combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute<br>
is selected from the remaining weighing hoppers.    The weighing hoppers selected to<br>
make up of these three combinations discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously,<br>
and the intermediate hoppers provided at the discharge outlets of the three chutes hold<br>
the objects to be weighed.    Holding the objects to be weighed, each of the intermediate<br>
hoppers discharges the objects to be weighed alternately to the associated one of the<br>
three first timing hoppers and to the associated one of the three second timing hoppers.<br>
The three first timing hoppers sequentially discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
first lower chute, while the three second timing hoppers sequentially discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the second lower chute.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0009]      However, in the configuration of Fig. 13, since the discharge outlets 6ge and<br><br>
6he of the inner chute 6g and the outer chute 6h provided with the collecting hopper 7g<br>
and the collecting hopper 7h, respectively, are positioned distant from a center of a circle<br>
formed by arrangement of the weighing hoppers 4, a distance over which the objects to<br>
be weighed which are discharged from the weighing hopper 4 to the chute 6g or 6h are<br>
transferred to the associated discharge outlet 6ge or 6he (collecting hopper 7g or 7h) and<br>
inclination of the chute are varied significantly, depending on the location of the<br>
weighing hopper 4, there is a significant variation in time when the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been transferred on the chute 6g or 6h reach the discharge outlet 6ge or 6he<br>
(collecting hopper 7g or 7h), and a time taken to transfer the objects to be weighed on the<br>
collecting chute 6g or 6h becomes long, depending on the location of the weighing<br>
hopper 4.    In particular, since the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the weighing hopper 4 (e.g.. weighing hopper 4 located on the right side in Fig.<br>
13(a)) located distant from the collecting hopper 7h to the outer chute 6h are transferred<br>
on the outer chute 6h disposed to surround the periphery of the inner chute 6g and reach<br>
the collecting hopper 7h, they reach at a time that is later than a time when the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hopper 4 (e.g., weighing<br>
hopper 4 located on the left side in Fig. 13(a)) located closer to the collecting hopper 7h<br>
reach the collecting hopper 7h.    For this reason, a long time lapses from when a tip part<br>
of a batch of the objects to be weighed which have been discharged simultaneously from<br>
a plurality of weighing hoppers 4 to the outer chute 6h reach the collecting hopper 7h<br>
until a tail part of the batch of the objects to be weighed reach the collecting hopper 7h.<br>
In this case, also, unless the operation speed is set low, a sufficient distance is unable to<br>
be provided between a batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged onto the<br>
outer chute 6h previously and a batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
onto the collecting chute 6h subsequently or they are likely to be mixed, depending on<br>
characteristic of the objects to be weighed, for example, when the objects to be weighed<br>
are bulky (bulk density is low).    This makes it difficult for the combination weigher to<br>
operate at a high speed.    In a case where, in order to avoid that the objects to be<br><br>
weighed are not discharged from the weighing hopper 4 which is distant from the<br>
collecting hopper 7 to the outer chute 6h, combination calculation is carried out without<br>
using measured value of the weighing hopper 4 (specified weighing hopper) which is<br>
distant from the collecting hopper 7h to prevent that weighing hopper 4 from being<br>
selected to make up of a combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the<br>
outer chute 6h, combination weighing precision (weighing precision of combination<br>
weight values) for the objects to be weighed which are discharged to the outer chute 6h<br>
becomes lower.<br>
[0010]    Also, the outer chute 6h is disposed so that the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the weighing hopper 4 located closer to the collecting hopper<br>
7g of the inner chute 6g to the outer chute 6h are transferred to the collecting hopper 7h<br>
through the outside of the periphery of the inner chute 6g.    Therefore, the collecting<br>
chute consisting of the outer chute and the inner chute is complicated in structure.<br>
Furthermore, in the above described configuration of the patent document 2,<br>
since the three intermediate hoppers provided respectively at the inner chute and the right<br>
and left outer chutes are each required to selectively discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
in one direction to the first timing hopper or in an opposite direction to the second timing<br>
hopper, the discharge gates of the intermediate hoppers are complicated in structure.<br>
[0011]      The present invention has been made to solve the above described problem,<br>
and an object of the present invention is to provide a combination weigher which is<br>
provided with a collecting chute having a relatively simple structure, and is capable of<br>
reducing a time taken to transfer objects to be weighed on the collecting chute without<br>
decreasing combination weighing precision and irrespective of characteristics of almost<br>
all objects to be weighed, thereby enabling a high-speed operation.    Another object of<br>
the present invention is to provide a combination weigher capable of discharging the<br>
objects to be weighed to two packaging machine inlets using a simple structure.<br>
Means For Solving the Problems<br>
[0012]    To achieve the above describe object, a combination weigher of a first aspect of<br><br>
the present invention comprises a plurality of combination hoppers which are arranged in<br>
a circle shape and are each fed with objects to be weighed, the combination hoppers<br>
being each configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively in an<br>
inward direction of the circle shape or in an outward direction of the circle shape; an<br>
inner chute which is disposed below the combination hoppers and is configured to gather<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged in the inward direction from the<br>
combination hoppers and to discharge the objects to be weighed from a discharge outlet<br>
provided at a bottom part thereof; a plurality of outer chutes which are disposed below<br>
the combination hoppers and are arranged side by side so as to surround the inner chute,<br>
the outer chutes being each configured to gather the objects to be weighed which have<br>
been discharged in the outward direction from the combination hoppers and to discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed from a discharge outlet provided at a bottom part thereof; a<br>
combination calculation means which is configured to determine a first discharge<br>
combination and a second discharge combination, the first discharge combination and the<br>
second discharge combination each including combination hoppers selected from among<br>
combination hoppers disposed above the inner chute and the plurality of outer chutes and<br>
each having a combination weight value within an allowable range with respect to a<br>
target weight value, the combination weight value being a total of weights of the objects<br>
to be weighed which are held by the combination hoppers; and a control means which is<br>
configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the first discharge<br>
combination to discharge the objects to be weighed in the inward direction to discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed to the inner chute and to cause the combination hoppers<br>
making up of the second discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed in<br>
the outward direction to discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer chute.<br>
[0013]    In such a configuration, since the plurality of outer chutes are arranged to<br>
surround the inner chute, a structure is relatively simple, and it becomes possible to<br>
shorten and substantially equalize distances over which the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the combination hoppers to the associated outer chutes are<br><br>
transferred on associated outer chutes, irrespective of the location of the combination<br>
hoppers.    And, irrespective of the characteristics of almost all the objects to be weighed,<br>
all the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the combination hoppers<br>
to the associated outer chutes can be discharged from the discharge outlets of the<br>
associated outer chutes in a short time.    Therefore, the combination weigher is able to<br>
have the collecting chutes (inner chute and outer chute) having a relatively simple<br>
structure, and is able to operate at a high speed by shortening the time taken to transfer<br>
the objects to be weighed on the collecting chutes irrespective of the characteristics of<br>
almost all the objects to be weighed, without degrading combination weighing precision.<br>
[0014]    In a combination weigher of a second aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the first aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform<br>
repetitive combination processes in such a manner that: combination calculation is<br>
performed based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by the combination<br>
hoppers to determine as an optimal combination one combination made up of<br>
combination hoppers in which a combination weight value is within the allowable range<br>
with respect to the target weight value, and the combination calculation is performed<br>
based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by combination hoppers which<br>
do not belong to an optimal combination determined in a previous combination process,<br>
in a subsequent combination process in n (n: plural number) times of successive<br>
combination processes in the repetitive combination processes, to determine optimal<br>
combinations determined sequentially in the repetitive combination processes, as the first<br>
discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately; wherein the<br>
control means is configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the first<br>
discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of the second discharge<br>
combination to alternately discharge the objects to be weighed, based on the first<br>
discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately determined by<br>
the combination calculation means; and wherein the control means is configured to feed,<br>
to the same packaging machine inlet, the objects to be weighed which have been<br><br>
discharged from the discharge outlet of the inner chute and the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the discharge outlets of the plurality of outer chutes.<br>
[0015]    In such a configuration, since the combination process can be performed n times<br>
within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time), and the objects to be<br>
weighed can be discharged to the same packaging machine inlet n times within one<br>
operation cycle time, a productivity within a specified time period can be improved.    In<br>
addition, since the objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers are discharged<br>
to the inner chute and to the outer chute alternately for the respective discharge<br>
combinations determined sequentially, that is, the objects to be weighed are discharged<br>
from the combination hoppers to the inner chute and to the outer chute only n/2 times<br>
within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance can be provided between a batch of<br>
the objects to be weighed which are discharged previously and a batch of the objects to<br>
be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of the chutes.    In the case of n =<br>
2, a double shift operation takes place, while in the case of n = 3, a triple shift operation<br>
takes place.<br>
[0016]    In a combination weigher of a third aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the first aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform<br>
repetitive combination processes in such a manner that: combination calculation is<br>
performed based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by the combination<br>
hoppers to determine as an optimal combination one combination made up of<br>
combination hoppers in which a combination weight value is within the allowable range<br>
with respect to the target weight value, and the combination calculation is performed<br>
based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by combination hoppers which<br>
do not belong to an optimal combination determined in a previous combination process,<br>
in a subsequent combination process in n (n: plural number) times of successive<br>
combination processes in the repetitive combination processes, to determine optimal<br>
combinations determined sequentially in the repetitive combination processes, as the first<br>
discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately; wherein the<br><br>
control means is configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the first<br>
discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of the second discharge<br>
combination to alternately discharge the objects to be weighed, based on the first<br>
discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately determined by<br>
the combination calculation means; and wherein the control means is configured to feed<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the discharge outlet of the<br>
inner chute to a first packaging machine inlet, and feed the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the discharge outlets of the plurality of outer chutes to a<br>
second packaging machine inlet.<br>
[0017]      In such a configuration, since the combination process can be performed n<br>
times within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time), and the objects to<br>
be weighed can be discharged to each of the two packaging machine inlets n/2 (n times<br>
in total) times within one operation cycle time, a productivity within a specified time<br>
period can be improved.    In addition, since the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
combination hoppers are discharged to the inner chute and to the outer chute alternately<br>
for the respective discharge combinations determined sequentially, that is, the objects to<br>
be weighed are discharged from the combination hoppers to each of the inner chute and<br>
to the outer chute only n/2 times within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance<br>
can be provided between a batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
previously and a batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently<br>
on each of the chutes.    In the case of n = 2, a double shift operation takes place, while in<br>
the case of n = 3, a triple shift operation takes place.<br>
[0018]    In a combination weigher of a fourth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the first aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform a<br>
combination process in such a manner that combination calculation is performed based<br>
on the weights of the objects to be weighed which are held by the combination hoppers to<br>
determine two combinations which do not include the same combination hopper and in<br>
which combination weight values obtained in the combination calculation are within the<br><br>
allowable range with respect to the target weight value and to determine one of the two<br>
combinations as the first discharge combination and the other as the second discharge<br>
combination; wherein the control means is configured to cause the combination hoppers<br>
making up of the first discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of<br>
the second discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously;<br>
and wherein the control means is configured to feed the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the discharge outlet of the inner chute to a first packaging<br>
machine inlet and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
discharge outlets of the plurality of outer chutes to a second packaging machine inlet.<br>
[0019]    In such a configuration, two discharge combinations are determined in one<br>
combination process, and the objects to be weighed of the two discharge combinations<br>
are discharged simultaneously, a productivity within a specified time can be improved.<br>
In addition, since the objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers making up of<br>
one of the two discharge combinations are discharged to the inner chute and the objects<br>
to be weighed inside the combination hoppers making up of the other discharge<br>
combination are discharged to the outer chute, a sufficient distance can be provided<br>
between a batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged previously and a<br>
batch of the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of the<br>
chutes.    Furthermore, since the two discharge combinations are determined<br>
simultaneously, weights of the objects to be weighed of a number of combination<br>
hoppers can be used in the combination calculation for determining the two discharge<br>
combinations.    As a result, combination weighing precision for the objects to be<br>
weighed which are discharged can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0020]      In a combination weigher of a fifth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the fourth aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform<br>
the combination calculation based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by<br>
combination hoppers which do not belong to the first and second discharge combinations<br>
determined in a previous combination process, in a subsequent combination process, in k<br><br>
(k: plural number) times of successive combination processes in the repetitive<br>
combination processes.<br>
[0021]      In such a configuration, since the combination process is performed k times<br>
within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time) and the objects to be<br>
weighed can be discharged from each of the inner chute and the outer chute k times<br>
within one operation cycle time, the combination weigher can be easily adapted to two<br>
packaging machines operated at a high speed or a twin-type packaging machine operated<br>
at a high speed.    For example, k is 2, 3, etc.<br>
[0022]      In a combination weigher of a sixth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the first aspect, a first collecting hopper is provided at the discharge outlet of<br>
the inner chute to hold the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
discharge outlet of the inner chute and to discharge the objects to be weighed, and a<br>
plurality of second collecting hoppers are respectively provided at the discharge outlets<br>
of the plurality of outer chutes to hold the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the discharge outlets of the outer chutes and to discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed.    Also, the control means is configured to control the first collecting hopper<br>
holding the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the combination<br>
hoppers and the plurality of second collecting hoppers holding the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the combination hoppers to cause the first collecting<br>
hopper to discharge the objects to be weighed and to cause the plurality of second<br>
collecting hoppers to simultaneously discharge the objects to be weighed.<br>
[0023]    In such a configuration, since the first and second collecting hoppers are<br>
provided so that the objects to be weighed are discharged in a state of being lumped<br>
together, the packaging machine can easily carry out a packaging operation for packaging<br>
the objects to be weighed.<br>
In a combination weigher of a seventh aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the sixth aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to<br>
determine the second discharge combination so that the objects to be weighed which<br><br>
have been discharged from the combination hoppers making up of the second discharge<br>
combination are discharged to at least two outer chutes.<br>
[0024]    In such a configuration, since the second discharge combination is determined<br>
to include combination hoppers disposed above respective of at least the two outer chutes,<br>
i.e., combinations hoppers respectively corresponding to the respective of at least the two<br>
outer chutes, and the objects to be weighed corresponding to that combination are<br>
gathered to respective of the at least two second collecting hoppers, the size (volume) of<br>
the second collecting hoppers can be reduced.<br>
[0025]      In a combination weigher of an eighth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the sixth aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform<br>
repetitive combination processes in such a manner that: combination calculation is<br>
performed based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by the combination<br>
hoppers to determine as an optimal combination one combination made up of<br>
combination hoppers in which a combination weight value is within the allowable range<br>
with respect to the target weight value, and the combination calculation is performed<br>
based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by combination hoppers which<br>
do not belong to an optimal combination determined in a previous combination process,<br>
in a subsequent combination process in a subsequent combination process in n (n: plural<br>
number) times of successive combination processes in the repetitive combination<br>
processes, to determine optimal combinations determined sequentially in the repetitive<br>
combination processes, as the first discharge combination and the second discharge<br>
combination alternately.    Also, the control means is configured to cause the<br>
combination hoppers making up of the first discharge combination and the combination<br>
hoppers making up of the second discharge combination to alternately discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed, and to cause the first collecting hopper and the plurality of second<br>
collecting hoppers to discharge the objects to be weighed alternately, based on the first<br>
discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately determined by<br>
the combination calculation means.    Also, the control means is configured to feed, to<br><br>
the same packaging machine inlet, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the first collecting hopper and the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the second plurality of collecting hoppers.<br>
[0026]      In such a configuration, the same advantages as those in the combination<br>
weigher of the second aspect can be achieved.    In addition, since the first and second<br>
collecting hoppers are provided so that the objects to be weighed are discharged in a state<br>
of being lumped together, the packaging machine can easily carry out a packaging<br>
operation for packaging the objects to be weighed.<br>
[0027]      In a combination weigher of a ninth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the sixth aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform<br>
repetitive combination processes in such a manner that: combination calculation is<br>
performed based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by the combination<br>
hoppers to determine as an optimal combination one combination made up of<br>
combination hoppers in which a combination weight value is within the allowable range<br>
with respect to the target weight value, and the combination calculation is performed<br>
based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by combination hoppers which<br>
do not belong to an optimal combination determined in a previous combination process,<br>
in a subsequent combination process in n (n: plural number) times of successive<br>
combination processes in the repetitive combination processes, to determine optimal<br>
combinations determined sequentially in the repetitive combination processes, as the first<br>
discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately.    Also, the<br>
control means is configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the first<br>
discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of the second discharge<br>
combination to alternately discharge the objects to be weighed, and to cause the first<br>
collecting hopper and the plurality of second collecting hoppers to discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed alternately, based on the first discharge combination and the second<br>
discharge combination alternately determined by the combination calculation means.<br>
Also, the control means is configured to feed the objects to be weighed which have been<br><br>
discharged from the first collecting hopper to a first packaging machine inlet and the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the plurality of second collecting<br>
hoppers to a second packaging machine inlet.<br>
In such a configuration, the same advantages as those in the combination<br>
weigher of the third aspect can be achieved.    In addition, since the first and second<br>
collecting hoppers are provided so that the objects to be weighed are discharged in a state<br>
of being lumped together, the packaging machine can easily carry out a packaging<br>
operation for packaging the objects to be weighed.      Furthermore, since the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been discharged from the first collecting hopper are fed to the<br>
first packaging machine inlet and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the plurality of second collecting hoppers are fed to the second packaging machine<br>
inlet, it suffices to configure so that the first collecting hopper and the plurality of second<br>
collecting hoppers are able to discharge the objects to be weighed only in their specified<br>
one directions.    So, the discharge gates of the collecting hoppers have a simple<br>
structure.<br>
[0028]      In a combination weigher of a tenth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the sixth aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform a<br>
combination process in such a manner that combination calculation is performed based<br>
on the weights of the objects to be weighed which are held by the combination hoppers to<br>
determine two combinations which do not include the same combination hopper and in<br>
which combination weight values obtained in the combination calculation are within the<br>
allowable range with respect to the target weight value and to determine one of the two<br>
combinations as the first discharge combination and the other as the second discharge<br>
combination; wherein the control means is configured to cause the combination hoppers<br>
making up of the first discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of<br>
the second discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously,<br>
and to cause the first collecting hopper and the plurality of second collecting hoppers to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously; and wherein the control means is<br><br>
configured to feed the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the first<br>
collecting hopper to a first packaging machine inlet and the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the plurality of second collecting hoppers to a second<br>
packaging machine inlet.<br>
In such a configuration, the same advantages as those in the combination<br>
weigher of the fourth aspect can be achieved.    In addition, since the first and second<br>
collecting hoppers are provided so that the objects to be weighed are discharged in a state<br>
of being lumped together, the packaging machine can easily carry out a packaging<br>
operation for packaging the objects to be weighed.      Furthermore, since the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been discharged from the first collecting hopper are fed to the<br>
first packaging machine inlet and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the plurality of second collecting hoppers are fed to the second packaging machine<br>
inlet, it suffices to configure so that the first collecting hopper and the plurality of second<br>
collecting hoppers are able to discharge the objects to be weighed only in their specified<br>
one directions.    So, the discharge gates of the collecting hoppers have a simple<br>
structure.<br>
[0029]      In a combination weigher of an eleventh aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the tenth aspect, the combination calculation means is configured to perform<br>
the combination calculation based on weights of objects to be weighed which are held by<br>
combination hoppers which do not belong to the first and second discharge combinations<br>
determined in a previous combination process, in a subsequent combination process in k<br>
(k: plural number) times of successive combination processes in the repetitive<br>
combination processes.<br>
[0030]      In such a configuration, since the combination process is performed k times<br>
within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time) and the objects to be<br>
weighed can be discharged from each of the first and second collecting hoppers k times<br>
within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time), the combination weigher<br>
can be easily adapted to two packaging machine operated at a high speed or the twin-type<br><br>
packaging machine operated at a high speed.    For example, k is 2, 3, etc.<br>
[0031]    In the combination weigher of a twelfth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the fourth or the tenth aspect, the combination process performed by the<br>
combination calculation means includes: a first process in which combination calculation<br>
is performed based on weights of the objects to be weighed which are held by the<br>
combination hoppers to determine as optimal combinations, combinations of<br>
combination hoppers in which combination weight values are within the allowable range<br>
with respect to the target weight value, and an optimal combination pair consisting of<br>
two optimal combinations which do not include the same combination hopper is<br>
determined; and a second process in which for each optimal combination pair, a total of<br>
absolute values of differences between combination weight values of the first and the<br>
second optimal combinations included in the optimal combination pair and the target<br>
weight value is calculated, one optimal combination pair in which the total of the<br>
absolute values of the differences is smallest is selected, one of two optimal<br>
combinations composing the selected optimal combination pair is determined as the first<br>
discharge combination and the other is determined as the second discharge combination.<br>
[0032]      In such a configuration, since the optimal combination pair in which the total<br>
of absolute values of the differences between the combination weight values of the<br>
optimal combinations and the target weight value is smallest is selected, and the two<br>
optimal combinations included in the optimal combination pair are determined as the<br>
discharge combinations, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed<br>
which are discharged from the combination hoppers belonging to the respective<br>
discharge combinations can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0033]    In a combination weigher of a thirteenth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the fourth or the tenth aspect, the combination process performed by the<br>
combination calculation means includes a first process in which combination calculation<br>
is performed based on weights of the objects to be weighed which are held by the<br>
combination hoppers to determine as allowable combinations, combinations of<br><br>
combination hoppers in which combination weight values are within the allowable range<br>
with respect to the target weight value, m (m: plural number) allowable combinations are<br>
selected as first optimal combinations from the allowable combinations by giving priority<br>
to allowable combinations in which absolute values of differences between combination<br>
weight values and the target weight value are smaller, one allowable combination in<br>
which an absolute value of a difference between a combination weight value and the<br>
target weight value is smallest is selected as a second optimal combination from<br>
allowable combinations made up of combination hoppers which are obtained by<br>
excluding combination hoppers belonging to each of the first optimal combinations, to<br>
determine m optimal combination pairs each consisting of associated first and second<br>
optimal combinations; and a second process in which for each optimal combination pair,<br>
a total of absolute values of differences between combination weight values of optimal<br>
combinations included in the optimal combination pair and the target weight value is<br>
calculated, one optimal combination pair in which the total of the absolute values of the<br>
differences is smallest is selected, one of the first and second optimal combinations<br>
composing the selected optimal combination pair is determined as the first discharge<br>
combination and the other is determined as the second discharge combination.<br>
[0034]    In such a configuration, since the optimal combination pair in which the total of<br>
the absolute values of the differences between the combination weight values of the first<br>
and second optimal combinations and the target weight value is smallest is selected, and<br>
the two optimal combinations included in the optimal combination pair are respectively<br>
determined as the discharge combinations, combination weighing precision for the<br>
objects to be weighed which are discharged from the combination hoppers belonging to<br>
the respective discharge combinations can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0035]    In a combination weigher of a fourteenth aspect, according to the combination<br>
weigher of the fourth or the tenth aspect, the combination process is performed by the<br>
combination calculation means in such a manner that combination calculation is<br>
performed based on weights of the objects to be weighed which are held by the<br><br>
combination hoppers to determine, as allowable combinations, combinations in which<br>
combination weight values are within the allowable range with respect to the target<br>
weight value from all the allowable combination, one allowable combination in which an<br>
absolute value of a difference between a combination weight value and the target weight<br>
value is smallest is selected as a first optimal combination, one allowable combination in<br>
which an absolute value of a difference between a combination weight value and the<br>
target weight value is smallest is selected as a second optimal combination from<br>
allowable combinations made up of combination hoppers which are obtained by<br>
excluding combination hoppers belonging to the first optimal combination, and one of<br>
the first and second optimal combinations is determined as the first discharge<br>
combination, and the other is determined as the second discharge combination.<br>
[0036]    In such a configuration, one allowable combination in which the absolute value<br>
of the difference between the combination weight value and the target weight value is<br>
smallest is selected as the first optimal combination from all the allowable combinations,<br>
one allowable combination in which the absolute value of the difference between the<br>
combination weight value and the target weight value is smallest is selected as the second<br>
optimal combination from allowable combinations of combination hoppers which are<br>
obtained by excluding combination hoppers belonging to the first optimal combination,<br>
and the two optimal combinations are respectively determined as discharge combinations.<br>
Therefore, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers belonging to the respective discharge<br>
combinations can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0037]    In the above described combination weigher, the combination hoppers may be<br>
weighing hoppers each of which has two weighing chambers arranged side by side in a<br>
direction in which the combination hoppers are arranged and measures weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed which are fed to the weighing chambers, the weighing chambers<br>
being each configured to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively in the inward<br>
direction or in the outward direction; and the combination calculation means may be<br><br>
configured to determine the first discharge combination and the second discharge<br>
combination such that the first and second discharge combinations each includes<br>
weighing chambers holding the objects to be weighed whose total weight is within the<br>
allowable range with respect to the target weight value.<br>
[0038]    In such a configuration, since the combination hoppers are weighing hoppers<br>
each having two weighing chambers, it becomes possible to suppress an increase in a<br>
diameter of a circle shape in which the combination hoppers are arranged and to increase<br>
the number of weight values used in the combination calculation so that improvement of<br>
combination weighing precision is achieved.<br>
[0039]    In the above described combination weigher, a plurality of weighing hoppers<br>
may be disposed above the combination hoppers to respectively correspond to the<br>
combination hoppers to measure weights of the objects to be weighed which are held by<br>
the weighing hoppers.    Also, the combination hoppers may be memory hoppers each of<br>
which has two accommodating chambers which are fed with the objects to be weighed<br>
whose weights have been measured by the weighing hoppers, the accommodating<br>
chambers being each configured to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively in the<br>
inward direction or in the outward direction.    Also, the weighing hoppers may be each<br>
configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to one of two<br>
accommodating chambers of an associated memory hopper.    Also, the combination<br>
calculation means may be configured to determine the first discharge combination and<br>
the second discharge combination such that the first and second discharge combinations<br>
each includes accommodating chambers holding the objects to be weighed whose total<br>
weight is within the allowable range with respect to the target weight value.<br>
[0040]    In such a configuration, since the combination hoppers are memory hoppers<br>
each having two accommodating chambers, it becomes possible to suppress an increase<br>
in a diameter of a circle shape in which the combination hoppers are arranged and to<br>
increase the number of weight values used in the combination calculation so that<br>
improvement of combination weighing precision is achieved.<br><br>
In the above described combination weigher, the combination hoppers may be<br>
arranged along two upper lines and one lower line, the combination hoppers located on<br>
the two upper lines may be weighing hoppers each of which measures weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed held by the weighing hopper, and the combination hoppers located<br>
on the one lower line may be memory hoppers each of which corresponds to two<br>
weighing hoppers and is fed with the objects to be weighed whose weight has been<br>
measured by the weighing hopper.    Also, the objects to be weighed which are<br>
discharged in the inward direction from the weighing hoppers located on an inner line of<br>
the two upper lines may be discharged to the inner chute, and the objects to be weighed<br>
which may be discharged in the outward direction from the weighing hoppers located on<br>
the inner line are discharged to an associated memory hopper.    Also, the objects to be<br>
weighed which are discharged in the inward direction from the weighing hoppers located<br>
on an outer line of the two upper lines may be discharged to the associated memory<br>
hopper, and the objects to be weighed which are discharged in the outward direction from<br>
the weighing hoppers located on the outer line may be discharged to the outer chute.<br>
[0041]    In such a configuration, since the combination hoppers are the weighing<br>
hoppers on the upper two lines and the memory hoppers on the lower one line, it<br>
becomes possible to suppress an increase in a diameter of a circle shape in which the<br>
combination hoppers are arranged and to increase the number of weight values used in<br>
the combination calculation so that improvement of combination weighing precision is<br>
achieved.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0042]    The present invention has the above described configuration, and provides<br>
advantages that the combination weigher has the collecting chutes made to have a<br>
relatively simple structure, and is able to shorten the time taken to transfer the objects to<br>
be weighed on the collecting chutes irrespective of the characteristics of almost all the<br>
objects to be weighed, and hence operate at a high speed, without degrading combination<br>
weighing precision.    In addition, the present invention provides advantages that the<br><br>
combination weigher is able to discharge the objects to be weighed to two packaging<br>
machine inlets using a simple structure.<br>

[Example 1]<br>
Fig. 1 (a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view of a combination weigher<br>
according an example 1 of an embodiment 1 of the present invention, as viewed from<br>
laterally, and Fig. l(b) is a schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chutes and two<br>
outer chutes) of the combination weigher, as viewed from above.<br>
[0047]    As shown in Fig. l(a), the combination weigher is constructed in such a manner<br>
that a center base body (body) 5 is disposed at a center of the combination weigher and<br>
supported by, for example, four legs (not shown), and a dispersion feeder 1 having a<br>
conical shape is mounted to an upper part of the center base body 5 to radially disperse<br>
objects to be weighed supplied from an external supplying device by vibration.    Around<br>
the dispersion feeder 1, a plurality of linear feeders 2 are provided to transfer the objects<br>
to be weighed sent from the dispersion feeder 1 into respective feeding hoppers 3 by<br>
vibration.    A plurality of feeding hoppers 3 and a plurality of weighing hoppers 4 are<br>
disposed below the linear feeders 2 and are arranged in a circular shape around the center<br>
base body 5 in such a manner that each feeding hopper 3 and each weighing hopper 4<br>
correspond to the associated one of the linear feeders 2.    The dispersion feeder 1, the<br>
linear feeders 2, the feeding hoppers 3, and the weighing hoppers 4 are mounted to the<br>
center base body 5.    Inside the center base body 5, drive units therefor (vibration device<br>
for the dispersion feeder 1 and the linear feeders 2, gate opening and closing devices for<br>
the feeding hoppers 3 and the weighing hoppers 4, etc) are accommodated.    Each<br>
weighing hopper 4 is attached with a weight sensor 41 such as a load cell which<br>
measures a weight of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hopper 4.    The<br><br>
weight sensors 41 are accommodated inside the center base body 5 along with the drive<br>
units.    Each weight sensor 41 outputs a measured value to a control unit 20.<br>
[0048]    Below the weighing hoppers 4 arranged in the circular shape, an inner chute 6a<br>
having a substantially inverted cone frustum shape is disposed, and outer chutes 6b and<br>
6c are disposed around the inner chute 6a in such a manner that outer chute 6b and 6c<br>
form two parts of a shape whose upper opening is concentric with that of the inner chute<br>
6a.    That is, the two outer chutes 6b and 6c are disposed to surround the upper opening<br>
of the inner chute 6a.<br>
[0049]    Each weighing hopper 4 is provided with gates to be able to selectively<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a, or to the outer chute 6a or 6b<br>
located therebelow.    In Fig. l(a), within a circle 21, the substantially actual shapes of<br>
the weighing hopper 4, and the gate are illustrated.    To be more specific, each weighing<br>
hopper 4 is provided with a gate (hereinafter referred to as an inner gate) 22 for<br>
discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a, and a gate (hereinafter<br>
referred to as an outer gate) 23 for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer<br>
chute 6b or 6c.    Therefore, a bottom surface portion of one side of the weighing hopper<br>
4 shown in Fig. l(b) corresponds to the inner gate 22 and a bottom surface portion of the<br>
other side corresponds to the outer gate 23.<br>
[0050]    A group B including the weighing hoppers 4 disposed above the outer chute 6b<br>
corresponds to the outer chute 6b.    The weighing hoppers 4 in the group B are each able<br>
to selectively discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or to the outer<br>
chute 6b.    Likewise, a group C including the weighing hoppers 4 disposed above the<br>
outer chute 6c corresponds to the outer chute 6c.    The weighing hoppers 4 in the group<br>
C are each able to selectively discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or<br>
to the outer chute 6c.<br>
[0051]    Collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c are provided at discharge outlets 6ae, 6be, and<br>
6ce at the bottom parts of the chutes 6a, 6b, and 6c, respectively.    One lower chute 8 is<br>
disposed below the three collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c.    The lower chute 8 serves to<br><br>
transfer the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from all the collecting<br>
hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c and discharge them through a discharge outlet 8a at a bottom part<br>
thereof.<br>
[0052]    Below the lower chute 8 of the combination weigher, one packaging machine<br>
(e.g., longitudinal pillow packaging machine) having an inlet which is not shown is<br>
disposed.    The objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the discharge<br>
outlet 8a of the lower chute 8 are fed into the inlet of the packaging machine.    The<br>
packaging machine charges the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
the combination weigher and packages them while manufacturing package bags.    Thus,<br>
in the present embodiment, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
all the collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c are configured to be fed into the same packaging<br>
machine inlet.<br>
[0053]    The control unit 20 includes a control means and a combination calculation<br>
means to control the operation of the entire combination weigher and to perform a<br>
combination process to determine a combination (discharge combination) made up of the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 which should discharge the objects to be weighed.    In the<br>
combination process, the combination calculation is performed based on measured values<br>
(measured values of the weights of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hoppers<br>
4, which are obtained using the weight sensors 41) of the weighing hoppers 4 to<br>
determine one combination made up of the weighing hoppers 4 in which a combination<br>
weight value which is a total of the measured values is within an allowable range<br>
(predetermined weight range) with respect to a target weight value to determine it as an<br>
optimal combination.    If the number of combinations in which the combination weight<br>
values are within the allowable range with respect to the target weight value is plural, a<br>
combination in which, for example, a total measured value is closest to the target weight<br>
value (or a combination whose measured value coincides with the target weight value, if<br>
any), i.e., a combination in which an absolute value of a difference between the total<br>
measured value and the target weight value is smallest, is determined as an optimal<br><br>
combination.    In the embodiment 1, the optimal combination is a discharge combination.<br>
In the combination weigher, the target weight value and the allowable range with respect<br>
to the target weight value are predetermined.    The allowable range is determined such<br>
that the target weight value is a lower limit value and a value larger than the target weight<br>
value is an upper limit value, for example.    By way of example, when the target weight<br>
value is set to 400g, the lower limit value of the allowable range is set to 400g which is<br>
equal to the target weight value, and the upper limit value of the allowable range is set to<br>
420g which is larger than the target weight value.    Alternatively, the allowable range<br>
may be determined such that a value smaller than the target weight value is set as the<br>
lower limit value and the upper limit value is not set (In this case, the upper limit value<br>
may be assumed to be infinite).<br>
[0054]    An outline of the operation of the combination weigher configured as described<br>
above will be first described.<br>
[0055]    The objects to be weighed are supplied from the external supplying device to<br>
the dispersion feeder 1.    The dispersion feeder 1 feeds the objects to be weighed to the<br>
feeding hopper 3 through the linear feeder 2.    The feeding hopper 3 feeds the objects to<br>
be weighed to the weighing hopper 4.    The weight sensor 41 measures the weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed into each weighing hopper 4, and sends the<br>
measured value to the control unit 20.    Then, the above described combination process<br>
is performed to determine the optimal combination.    The weighing hoppers 4 selected to<br>
make up of the optimal combination discharge the objects to be weighed and the feeding<br>
hopper 3 feeds the objects to be weighed to the weighing hoppers 4 which are empty.<br>
The linear feeder 2 feeds the objects to be weighed to the feeding hopper 3 which is<br>
empty.<br>
[0056]    In present embodiment, the combination process is performed sequentially, and<br>
the weighing hoppers 4 discharge the objects to be weighed in such a manner that the<br>
discharge direction of the weighing hoppers 4 is switched for each optimal combination<br>
determined in the combination process.    To be more specific, the weighing hoppers 4<br><br>
discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to the inner chute 6a and to the outer<br>
chute 6b or 6c for respective of optimal combinations sequentially determined.<br>
According to the discharge, the inner chute collecting hopper 7a and the outer chute<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c alternately discharge the objects to be weighed.<br>
[0057]    Subsequently, an operation of the combination weigher which takes place when<br>
the combination weigher is configured to carry out the double shift operation will be<br>
described in detail.    In the double shift operation, the number of weighing hoppers 4 in<br>
each of the groups B and C may be set to seven so that the total number of the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 in each of the groups B and C is fourteen, and the number of the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 which would be selected in the combination process (the number of weighing<br>
hoppers 4 which would be selected to make up of the optimal combination) may be set to<br>
four.    This makes it possible to achieve weighing precision substantially as high as that<br>
in the single shift operation carried out under the condition in which the total number of<br>
weighing hoppers 4 is ten and the number of weighing hoppers 4 which would be<br>
selected in the combination process is four.    The phrase " the number of the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 which would be selected in the combination process is set to four" means that<br>
the linear feeder 2 and others are configured to operate so that a target feed amount of the<br>
objects to be weighed which are fed from each feeding hopper 3 to the weighing hopper<br>
4 once becomes approximately 1/4 of the target weight value.<br>
[0058]    Fig. 2 is a timing chart showing the double shift operation carried out in the<br>
combination weigher according to the present embodiment.<br>
One weighing cycle time Tw is, for example, a time period taken to accomplish<br>
a procedure in which, weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of a discharge<br>
combination determined in a combination process in a previous weighing cycle start to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed, the objects to be weighed are subsequently fed to<br>
these weighing hoppers 4 making up of the discharge combination, time for stabilizing<br>
the associated weight sensors 41 lapses, these weight sensors 41 measure the weights of<br>
the objects to be weighed, and thereafter a combination process is performed using at<br><br>
least the measured values of the weighing hoppers 4 to determine a discharge<br>
combination.    In the example shown in Fig. 2, one weighing cycle time Tw is equal to<br>
one operation cycle time.    One operation cycle time is, for example, a time period taken<br>
to accomplish a procedure, in which immediately after a discharge combination is<br>
determined in a combination process in a previous operation cycle, weighing hoppers 4<br>
selected to make up of the discharge combination discharge the objects to be weighed,<br>
the objects to be weighed are subsequently fed to these weighing hoppers 4 making up of<br>
the discharge combination, time for stabilizing the weight sensors 41 lapses, these weight<br>
sensors 41 measure the weights of the objects to be weighed, and thereafter a<br>
combination process is performed using at least the measured values of these weighing<br>
hoppers 4 to determine a discharge combination.    Therefore, one weighing cycle time<br>
Tw is equal to one operation cycle time in a case where an allowance time, a wait time,<br>
etc, which lapses from when a discharge combination is determined in a combination<br>
process until weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the discharge combination start<br>
to discharge the objects to be weighed are zero.    Fig. 2 illustrates a case where the<br>
above described allowance time, wait time, etc are zero.<br>
[0059]    The double shift operation in the present embodiment is carried out in such a<br>
manner that a combination process is performed once in every Tw/2 time and weighing<br>
hoppers 4 making up of an optimal combination selected in the combination process<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed.    The combination process in the double shift<br>
operation is performed in such a manner that combination calculation is performed using<br>
measured values (weight values of the objects to be weighed) of the weighing hoppers 4<br>
holding the objects to be weighed whose weight values have been measured by the<br>
weight sensors 41, which are selected from among all the weighing hoppers 4, to thereby<br>
select one combination made up of weighing hoppers 4 in which a total measured value<br>
is within a specified weight range and to determine it as an optimal combination, and<br>
measured values of all the weighing hoppers 4 are used in combination calculation in two<br>
continuous combination processes.    The weighing hoppers 4 making up of optimal<br><br>
combinations sequentially selected resulting from the combination processes repeated<br>
once in every Tw/2 time discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to the inner<br>
chute 6a and to the outer chute 6a or 6c for respective of the optimal combinations, and<br>
according to the discharge, the collecting hopper 7a and the collecting hopper 7b or 7c<br>
alternately discharge the objects to be weighed.    Thereby, the objects to be weighed are<br>
fed to the packaging machine twice within one weighing cycle time Tw.    In this case,<br>
one discharge cycle time Tdl for the combination weigher is equal to 1/2 of one<br>
weighing cycle time Tw.    One discharge cycle time Tdl is equal to one packaging cycle<br>
time Tpl for the packaging machine.    Whereas the measured values of all the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 are used in combination calculation in two continuous combination processes,<br>
the measured values of all the weighing hoppers 4 are not necessarily used.      For<br>
example, in cases where the total number of the weighing hoppers 4 is large, the<br>
measured values of all the weighing hoppers 4 are sometimes not used in combination<br>
calculation in two continuous combination processes, if the number of measured values<br>
used in one combination calculation is limited, that is, the number is predetermined.<br>
[0060]    Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 7a to opens its gate<br>
to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine in response to the feed<br>
command signal (time tl).    And, the control unit 20 causes the weighing hoppers 4<br>
selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open their inner gates 22 based on the<br>
operation timing of the gate of the collecting hopper 7a to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed from the weighing hoppers 4 to the inner chute 6a (time tl).    Receiving a<br>
subsequent feed command signal as an input, the control unit 20 causes the outer chute<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c to open its gate to discharge the objects o be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine in response to the feed command signal (time t2).    And, the control<br>
unit 20 causes the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the optimal combinations<br>
to open their outer gates 23 based on the operation timing of the gate of the collecting<br>
hopper 7b or 7c to discharge the objects to be weighed from the weighing hoppers 4 to<br><br>
the outer chute 6a or 6b (time t2).    Then, receiving a subsequent feed command signal<br>
as an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 7a to open its<br>
gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine in response to the<br>
feed command signal, and causes the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the<br>
optimal combinations to open their inner gates 22 to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
from the weighing hoppers 4 to the inner chute 6a (time t3).    Thereafter, the similar<br>
operation is repeated.<br>
[0061]    In the operation shown in Fig. 2, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening the inner gates 22 at time t1 are<br>
gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 7a before time t3, and the<br>
collecting hopper 7a opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time t3.    Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening their outer gates 23 at time t2 are<br>
gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c before time t4, and the<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time t4.<br>
[0062]    As described above, the weighing hoppers 4 making up of the optimal<br>
combinations discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a and to the outer<br>
chute 6b or 6c alternately, and according to the discharge, the inner chute collecting<br>
hopper 7a and the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c alternately discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed to the packaging machine.    Whereas in the operation of Fig. 2, the<br>
opening and closing timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 7a are the same as the<br>
opening and closing timings of the inner gates 22 of the weighing hoppers 4 and the<br>
opening and closing timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 7b or 7c are the same as<br>
the opening and closing timings of the outer gates 23 of the weighing hoppers 4, these<br>
are merely exemplary.    For example, the control unit 20 may control the opening and<br>
closing timings of the gates 22 and 23 of the weighing hoppers 4 based on the opening<br>
and closing timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c to make the<br><br>
opening and closing timings of the gates different.<br>
[0063]    By causing the combination weigher to perform the double shift operation as<br>
described above, the combination weigher is able to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
to the packaging machine once in every Tw/2 time at a speed twice as high as that of the<br>
single shift operation.    This enables combination weigher to be adapted to the<br>
packaging machine operated at a high speed.<br>
[0064]    Subsequently, an operation of the combination weigher taking place when the<br>
combination weigher is configured to carry out a triple shift operation will be described<br>
in detail.    In the triple shift operation, for example, the number of weighing hoppers 4 in<br>
each of the groups B and C may be set to nine so that the total number of weighing<br>
hoppers 4 is set to eighteen, and the number of the weighing hoppers 4 in each of the<br>
groups B and C which would be selected in the combination process may be set to four.<br>
This makes it possible to achieve weighing precision substantially as high as that in the<br>
single shift operation carried out under the condition in which the total number of<br>
weighing hoppers 4 is ten and the number of weighing hoppers 4 which would be<br>
selected in the combination process is four.<br>
[0065]    Fig. 3 is a timing chart showing the triple shift operation carried out by the<br>
combination weigher according to the present embodiment.    Fig. 3 illustrates an<br>
example in which one weighing cycle time Tw is equal to one operation cycle time, as in<br>
the example of Fig. 2.<br>
[0066]    The triple shift operation in the present embodiment is carried out in such a<br>
manner that a combination process is performed once in every Tw/3 time and the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 making up of an optimal combination selected in the combination<br>
process discharge the objects to be weighed.    The combination process in the triple shift<br>
operation is performed in such a manner that combination calculation is carried out using<br>
measured values (weight values of the objects to be weighed) of the weighing hoppers 4<br>
holding the objects to be weighed whose weight values have been measured by the<br>
weight sensors 41, which are selected from among all the weighing hoppers 4 to select<br><br>
one combination made up of the weighing hoppers 4 in which a total measured value is<br>
within a predetermined weight range and to determine it as an optimal combination, and<br>
measured values of all the weighing hopper 4 are used in combination calculation in<br>
three continuous combination processes.    The weighing hoppers 4 making up of optimal<br>
combinations sequentially selected resulting from repetitive combination processes<br>
performed once in every Tw/3 time discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to the<br>
inner chute 6a and to the outer chute 6b or 6c for respective of the optimal combinations,<br>
and according to the discharge, the collecting hopper 7a and the collecting hopper 7b or<br>
7c alternately discharge the objects to be weighed.    Thereby, the objects to be weighed<br>
are discharged to the packaging machine three times within one weighing cycle time Tw.<br>
In this case, one discharge cycle time Td2 for the combination weigher is equal to 1/3 of<br>
one weighing cycle time Tw.    One discharge cycle time Td2 is equal to one packaging<br>
cycle time Tp2 of the packaging machine.    Whereas the measured values of all the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 are used in combination calculation in three continuous combination<br>
processes, the measured values of all the weighing hoppers 4 are not necessarily used.<br>
For example, in cases where the total number of the weighing hoppers 4 is large, the<br>
measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 are sometimes not used in combination<br>
calculation in continuous three combination processes, if the number of measured values<br>
used in one combination calculation is limited, that is, the number is predetermined.<br>
[0067]    Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 7a to open its gate<br>
to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine in response to the feed<br>
command signal (time t11).    And, the control unit 20 causes the weighing hoppers 4<br>
selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open their inner gates 22 based on the<br>
operation timing of the gate of the collecting hopper 7a to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the inner chute 6a (time t11).    Receiving a subsequent feed command signal<br>
as an input, the control unit 20 causes the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c to open<br>
its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine in response to<br><br>
the feed command signal (time tl2).    And, the control unit 20 causes the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open their outer gates 23<br>
based on the operation timing of the gate of the collecting hopper 7b or 7c to discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c (time tl2).    Then, receiving a<br>
subsequent feed command signal as an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute<br>
collecting hopper 7a to open its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine, and causes the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the<br>
optimal combinations to open their inner gates 22 to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
to the inner chute 6a, in response to the feed command signal (time tl3).    Thereafter, the<br>
similar operation is repeated.<br>
[0068]    In the operation shown in Fig. 3, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening their inner gates 22 at time t11 are<br>
gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 7a before time tl3, and the<br>
collecting hopper 7a opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time tl3.    Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening the outer gates 23 at time tl2 are<br>
gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c before time tl4, and<br>
the collecting hopper 7b or 7c opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time tl4.<br>
[0069]    As described above, the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the optimal<br>
combinations every time combination calculation is performed, discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed to the inner chute 6a and to the outer chute 6b or 6c alternately, and<br>
according to the discharge, the inner chute collecting hopper 7a and the outer chute<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c alternately discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine.    Whereas in the operation of Fig. 3, the opening and closing<br>
timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 7a are the same as the opening and closing<br>
timings of the inner gates 22 of the weighing hoppers 4 and the opening and closing<br>
timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 7b or 7c are the same as the opening and<br><br>
closing timings of the outer gates 23 of the weighing hoppers 4, these are merely<br>
exemplary.    For example, the control unit 20 may control the opening and closing<br>
timings of the gates 22 and 23 of the weighing hoppers 4 based on the opening and<br>
closing timings of the gates of the collecting hopper 7a, 7b, and 7c to make the opening<br>
and closing timings of the gates different.<br>
[0070]    By causing the combination weigher to perform the triple shift operation as<br>
described above, the combination weigher discharges the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine once in every Tw/3 time at a speed three times as high as that of the<br>
single shift operation.    This makes it possible to adapt the combination weigher to the<br>
packaging machine operated at a high speed.<br>
[0071]    Since in the example 1, the plurality of outer chutes 6b and 6c are disposed to<br>
surround the opening at the upper part of the inner chute 6a, a structure is relatively<br>
simple, and distances over which the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the weighing hoppers 4 to the outer chute 6b or 6c are transferred to the collecting<br>
hopper 7b or 7c can be made short and substantially equal irrespective of the locations of<br>
the weighing hoppers 4, and all of the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the weighing hoppers 4 to the outer chute 6b or 6c can be gathered to the associated<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c in a short time irrespective of characteristics of almost all the<br>
objects to be weighed.    In addition, since the collecting hopper 7a is provided at the<br>
discharge outlet 6ae at a center of the bottom part of the inner chute 6a, distances<br>
between the weighing hoppers 4 and the collecting hopper 7a are made substantially<br>
made equal, and all the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
weighing hopper 4 to the inner chute 6a can be gathered to the collecting hopper 7a in a<br>
short time irrespective of characteristics of almost all the objects to be weighed.    As<br>
described above, a structure of the collecting chutes (inner chute and outer chute) can be<br>
made simple, and a time taken to transfer objects to be weighed on the collecting chute<br>
can be reduced, irrespective of characteristics of almost all objects to be weighed,<br>
thereby enabling a high-speed operation.    Also, the above described double shift<br><br>
operation or triple shift operation can increase a productivity within a specified time.<br>
Furthermore, combination weighing precision does not degrade, because an event that<br>
the measured values of specified weighing hoppers 4 are not used to determine optimal<br>
combinations for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c, does<br>
not take place.<br>
In the first example, the size of the outer chute collecting hoppers 7b and 7c can<br>
be reduced, by configuring the setting in the combination process so that at least one<br>
weighing hopper 4 is selected from each of the groups B and C respectively<br>
corresponding to the outer chutes 6b and 6c to make up of the optimal combination or a<br>
maximum number of the weighing hoppers 4 selected from each of the groups B and C is<br>
limited to less than the number of the weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected.    For<br>
example, when four weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of the optimal<br>
combination (when the number of weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected is four),<br>
combination calculation is performed under a condition in which at least one weighing<br>
hopper 4 is selected from each of the groups B and C, or a maximum number of the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 which are selected from each of the groups B and C is three.      If<br>
such a condition is not set, then the outer chute collecting hoppers 7b and 7c are each<br>
required to have a volume for accommodating the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the four weighing hoppers 4, as in the inner chute collecting hopper 7a.<br>
However, if the condition is set, the number of weighing hoppers 4 which discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c is three at maximum, and therefore, the<br>
outer chute collecting hoppers 7b and 7c may be formed to have a volume for<br>
accommodating the objects to be weighed from the three weighing hoppers 4.    In other<br>
words, by determining the optimal combinations so that the objects to be weighed inside<br>
the weighing hoppers 4 making up of optimal combinations for discharging the objects to<br>
be weighed to the outer chutes are always discharged to the two outer chutes 6b and 6c,<br>
the size of the collecting hoppers 7b and 7c can be reduced.    This advantage is achieved<br>
by setting the above described condition at least in the combination process for<br><br>
determining the discharge combination (optimal combination) for discharging the objects<br>
to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c.    By setting the same condition in the<br>
combination process for determining the discharge combination (optimal combination)<br>
for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a, the combination process<br>
can be carried out in a common method.    In addition, a difference in the number of<br>
weighing hoppers 4 between the groups B and C which can be used for combination<br>
calculation is made smaller, and combination weighing precision is not reduced when<br>
determining the discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the<br>
outer chute 6b or 6c.<br>
[0072]    [Example 2]<br>
Fig. 4 (a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view of a combination weigher<br>
according an example 2 of the embodiment 1 of the present invention, as viewed from<br>
laterally, and Fig. 4(b) is a schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chute and three<br>
outer chutes) and weighing hoppers of the combination weigher as viewed from above.<br>
[0073]    In the example 1 shown in Fig. 1, the outer chute consists of two parts, while in<br>
the present example, the outer chute consists of three parts.    So, collecting hoppers 7d,<br>
7e, and 7f are respectively provided at discharge outlets 6de, 6ee, and 6fe at bottom parts<br>
of the three outer chutes 6d, 6e, and 6f, to hold and discharge the objects to be weighed.<br>
In Fig. 4(a), the outer chute 6f and the collecting hopper 7f are located on back side of<br>
the inner chute 6a and the collecting hopper 7a and therefore are invisible.    The other<br>
configuration is identical to that of the example 1, and will not be further described.<br>
[0074]    The example 2 may be configured as in the example 1 when the double shift<br>
operation and the triple shift operation are carried out.    In the configuration for the<br>
double shift operation, for example, the number of weighing hoppers 4 in each of groups<br>
D and E respectively corresponding to the outer chutes 6d and 6e may be set to five, the<br>
number of weighing hoppers 4 in a group F corresponding to the outer chute 6f may be<br>
set to four so that the total number of weighing hoppers 4 may be set to fourteen, and the<br>
number of weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected in the combination process may<br><br>
be set to four.    Alternatively, the number of weighing hoppers 4 in the group F may be<br>
set to five equal to the number of weighing hoppers 4 in each of the groups D and E so<br>
that the total number of the weighing hoppers 4 may be set to fifteen.    The timing chart<br>
in the case of carrying out the double shift operation is identical to that of Fig. 2.    The<br>
control unit 20 causes the outer chute collecting hopper 7d, 7e or 7f to open and close its<br>
gate at the same timings as the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c in Fig. 1.<br>
[0075]    In the configuration for causing the triple shift operation, for example, the<br>
number of weighing hoppers 4 in each of the groups D, E and F may be set to six so that<br>
the total number of weighing hoppers 4 may be set to eighteen, and the number of<br>
weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected in the combination process may be set to<br>
four.    The timing chart in the case of carrying out the triple shift operation is identical to<br>
that of Fig. 3.    The control unit 20 causes the outer chute collecting hopper 7d, 7e or 7f<br>
to open and close its gate at the same timings as the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or<br>
7c in Fig. 1.<br>
[0076]    In the example 2, the number of parts of the outer chute is different from that of<br>
the example 1, but the same advantages as those of the example 1 are achieved.<br>
[0077]    As in the example 1, in the example 2, the size of the outer chute collecting<br>
hoppers 7d, 7e, and 7f can be reduced, by configuring the setting in the combination<br>
process so that at least one weighing hopper 4 is selected from two or more of the groups<br>
D, E, and F (in this case, two groups or all of the three groups) of the weighing hoppers 4<br>
respectively corresponding to the outer chutes 6d, 6e, and 6f to make up of the optimal<br>
combination, or a maximum number of the weighing hoppers 4 selected from each of the<br>
groups D, E, and F is limited to less than the number of weighing hopers 4 which would<br>
be selected.<br>
[0078]    Whereas the configuration in which the outer chute consists of two parts has<br>
been described in the example 1 and the configuration in which the outer chute consists<br>
of three parts has been described in the example 2, the outer chute may be configured to<br>
consist of four or more parts in the same manner.<br><br>
[0079]    Whereas the configuration for carrying out the double shift operation and the<br>
configuration for carrying out the triple shift operation have been described in the<br>
embodiment 1, the configuration for carrying out the single shift operation which is slow<br>
in speed (discharge speed) may be used, as a matter of course.    In the configuration for<br>
carrying out the single shift operation, for example, the total number of weighing hopers<br>
4 is set to ten, the number of weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected in a<br>
combination process is set to four, the combination calculation is performed once within<br>
one weighing cycle time Tw, the weighing hoppers 4 discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
once within one weighing cycle time Tw, and the collecting hopper discharges the<br>
objects to be weighed to the packaging machine once within one weighing cycle time Tw.<br>
In this case, one discharge cycle time for the combination wiegher is equal to the one<br>
weighing cycle time Tw.      In this case, also, weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of<br>
optimal combinations are configured to discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to<br>
the inner chute and to the outer chute, every time combination calculation is performed.<br>
[0080]    In the present embodiment, provided that all the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 slide down on the collecting chutes<br>
(inner chute and outer chute) in a short time, and the packaging operation of the<br>
packaging machine is not impeded, the collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c may be omitted.<br>
In this case, configuration is simplified because of the omission of the collecting hoppers,<br>
and so, control therefor is unnecessary.    The control unit 20 may cause weighing<br>
hoppers 4 selected to make up of an optimal combination to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed in response to, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine.<br>
For example, in the configuration of Fig. 1, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 may be discharged to the lower chute 8 directly<br>
from the discharge outlets 6ae, 6be, or 6ce of the collecting chute 6a, 6b or 6c,<br>
respectively.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Fig. 5 (a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view of a combination weigher<br><br>
according to an embodiment 2 of the present invention, as viewed from laterally, and Fig.<br>
5(b) is a schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chute and two outer chutes) and<br>
weighing hoppers of the combination weigher as viewed from above, and Fig. 5(c) is a<br>
schematic view of two lower chutes of the combination weigher as viewed from above.<br>
[0081]    As shown in Fig. 5(c), in the combination weigher of the present embodiment,<br>
two lower chutes 8L and 8R are disposed below the three collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and<br>
7c.    The collecting hopper 7a is provided with a gate (not shown) to be able to discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed to the lower chute 8L, while the collecting hoppers 7b and 7c<br>
are provided with gates (not shown) to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed to<br>
the lower chute 8R.    The lower chute 8L serves to transfer the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 7a and to discharge them from a<br>
discharge outlet 8La at a bottom part thereof.    The lower chute 8R serves to transfer the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 7b or 7c<br>
and to discharge them from a discharge outlet 8Ra at a bottom part thereof.    The other<br>
configuration is identical to that of the example 1 of the embodiment 1 shown in Fig. 1,<br>
and will not be further described.    It should be noted that the combination process<br>
performed by the control unit 20 and the operation timing are different from those of the<br>
embodiment 1.<br>
[0082]    Below the lower chutes 8L and 8R of the combination weigher, two packaging<br>
machines or a twin type packaging machine having two inlets for the objects to be<br>
weighed are/is disposed.    The objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
the discharge outlet 8La of the lower chute 8L and the discharge outlet 8Ra of the lower<br>
chute 8R are fed into the inlets of the associated packaging machines (first and second<br>
packaging machine inlets), and are charged into package bags in the packaging machine<br>
for packaging.    In the present embodiment, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the collecting hopper 7a are fed into the first packaging machine inlet<br>
and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hoppers<br>
7b and 7c are fed into the second packaging machine inlet.<br><br>
[0083]    Whereas in the present embodiment, the two lower chutes 8L and 8R are<br>
provided to respectively correspond to the two packaging machine inlets, the collecting<br>
hopper 7a may be configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed only to the<br>
lower chute 8L and the collecting hoppers 7b and 7c may be configured to be able to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed only to the lower chute 8R.    Therefore, the<br>
discharge gates of the collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, and 7c have a simple structure.<br>
[0084]    The control unit 20 includes a control means and a combination calculation<br>
means to control the operation of the entire combination weigher and to perform a<br>
combination process to determine a combination made up of weighing hoppers 4 which<br>
will discharge the objects to be weighed.    In the combination process, the combination<br>
calculation is performed based on measured values (measured values of the objects to be<br>
weighed inside the weighing hoppers 4, which are obtained using the weight sensors 41)<br>
of the weighing hopper 4 to determine two combinations each made up of the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 in which a combination weight value which is a total of the measured values is<br>
within an allowable range (predetermined weight range) with respect to a target weight<br>
value, to determine them as discharge combinations.    This combination process will be<br>
described in detail later.<br>
[0085]    An outline of the operation of the combination weigher configured as described<br>
above will be first described.<br>
[0086]    The objects to be weighed are supplied from the external supplying device to<br>
the dispersion feeder 1.    The dispersion feeder 1 feeds the objects to be weighed to the<br>
feeding hopper 3 through the linear feeder 2.    The feeding hopper 3 feeds the objects to<br>
be weighed to the weighing hopper 4.    The weight sensor 41 measures the weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed into the weighing hopper 4, and sends the<br>
measured value to the control unit 20.    Then, the control unit 20 performs the above<br>
described combination process to determine two discharge combinations simultaneously.<br>
The weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the two discharge combinations<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously.    The feeding hopper 3 feeds the<br><br>
objects to be weighed to the weighing hoppers 4 which are empty.    The linear feeder 2<br>
feeds the objects to be weighed to the feeding hopper 3 which is empty.<br>
[0087]    In the above configuration, the weighing hoppers 4 making up of the two<br>
discharge combinations determined simultaneously in a combination process discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed in different directions.    To be specific, the weighing hoppers 4<br>
making up of one of the two discharge combinations discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
to the inner chute 6a, while the weighing hoppers 4 making up of the other discharge<br>
combination discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c.    Also, the<br>
inner chute collecting hopper 7a and the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed simultaneously.<br>
[0088]    Subsequently, the combination process in the present embodiment will be<br>
described in detail.    Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing the combination process in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0089]    In step S1, combination calculation is performed using measured values (weight<br>
values) of the objects to be weighed of weighing hoppers 4 holding the objects to be<br>
weighed whose weight values have been measured by the weight sensors 41 to determine<br>
all combinations in which combination weight values which are total measured values<br>
are within an allowable range with respect to a target weight value and determine them as<br>
optimal combinations.<br>
[0090]    In step S2, an optimal combination pair formed by combining two optimal<br>
combinations which do not include the same weighing hopper 4 is determined.<br>
[0091]    In step S3, for each optimal combination pair, an absolute value of a difference<br>
between a combination weight value of each of the optimal combinations forming the<br>
optimal combination pair and the target weight value is calculated, and a total of absolute<br>
values of differences is calculated.    The absolute value of the difference between the<br>
combination weight value and the target weight value is an absolute value of a value<br>
obtained by subtracting the target weight value from the combination weight value, or an<br>
absolute value of a value obtained by subtracting the combination weight value from the<br><br>
target weight value, and is zero or a positive value.<br>
[0092]    In step S4, one optimal combination pair in which the total of the absolute<br>
values of the differences calculated in step S3 is smallest is selected, one of the two<br>
optimal combinations forming the selected pair is determined as a discharge combination<br>
(first discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute<br>
6a, and the other optimal combination is determined as a discharge combination (second<br>
discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or<br>
6c.    A determination method of the first discharge combination and the second<br>
discharge combination is predetermined and any method may be used.    For example,<br>
serial numbers may be assigned to the weighing hoppers 4, an optimal combination<br>
including a weighing hopper 4 with a smallest number may be determined as the first<br>
discharge combination, and the other optimal combination may be determined as the<br>
second discharge combination, or vice versa.    Alternatively, the first and second optimal<br>
combinations may be determined according to the magnitude of the combination weight<br>
value.    For example, an optimal combination with a larger combination weight value<br>
may be determined as the first discharge combination and an optimal combination with a<br>
smaller combination weight value may be determined as the second discharge<br>
combination, or vice versa.      In a further alternative, the optimal combination with the<br>
larger combination weight value and the optimal combination with the smaller<br>
combination weight value may be alternately determined as the first and second<br>
discharge combinations, every time combination process is performed.<br>
[0093]    Whereas in steps S3 and S4, for each optimal combination pair, the total of the<br>
absolute values of the differences between the combination weight values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value may be calculated, and one<br>
optimal combination pair in which the total of the absolute values of the differences is<br>
smallest is selected to determine the two discharge combinations, the total of squares of<br>
the absolute values of the differences between the combination weight values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value, may be calculated, and an<br><br>
optimal combination pair in which a total of the squares of the differences is smallest<br>
may be selected to determine it as two discharge combinations, for each optimal<br>
combination pair.<br>
[0094]    As described above, two discharge combinations are determined in one<br>
combination process.    Fig. 7 is a timing chart showing a first operation example of the<br>
combination weigher of the present embodiment.    In the example in Fig. 7, as in the<br>
example in Fig. 2, one weighing cycle time Tw is equal to one operation cycle time.    It<br>
should be noted that two discharge combinations are determined in one combination<br>
process and the two discharge combinations discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0095]    In the first operation example of the present embodiment, combination process<br>
is performed to determine two discharge combinations simultaneously once in every Tw<br>
time and weighing hoppers 4 making up of the two discharge combinations determined in<br>
the combination process discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously once in<br>
every Tw time.    Also, the collecting hopper 7a and the collecting hopper 7b or 7c<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously once in every Tw time.    Thereby,<br>
the objects to be weighed corresponding to the two discharge combinations are fed into<br>
the packaging machine within one weighing cycle time Tw.    In this case, one discharge<br>
cycle time Td3 of the combination weigher is equal to one weighing cycle time Tw.<br>
Also, the one discharge cycle time Td3 is equal to one packaging cycle time Tp3 of the<br>
packaging machine.    In this case, by configuring the setting so that the number of<br>
weighing hoppers 4 in each of the groups B and C is set to seven so that the total number<br>
of weighing hoppers is set to fourteen, and the number of weighing hoppers 4 which<br>
would be selected to make up of one optimal combination is set to four, as in the double<br>
shift operation in the example 1 of the embodiment 1, for example, higher combination<br>
weighing precision is achieved.<br>
[0096]    Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 7a and the outer<br><br>
chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c to open their gates simultaneously to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the packaging machine, in response to the feed command signal<br>
(time t21).    And, the control unit 20 causes the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up<br>
of one of the discharge combinations to open their inner gates 22 based on the operation<br>
timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 7a and, 7b. or 7c to discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed to the inner chute 6a, and at the same time, causes the weighing hoppers 4<br>
selected to make up of the other discharge combination to open their outer gates 23 to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c (time t21).    The above<br>
operation is repeated every time the feed command signal is received as the input (time<br>
t22, time t23).<br>
[0097]    In the operation shown in Fig. 7, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening the inner gates 22 at time t21 are<br>
gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 7a before time t22, and the<br>
collecting hopper 7a opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine through the lower chute 8L at time t22.    Likewise, the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening the outer<br>
gates 23    at time t21 are gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or<br>
7c before time t22, and the collecting hopper 7b or 7c opens its gate to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the packaging machine through the lower chute 8R at time t22.<br>
[0098]    Whereas in the operation of Fig. 7, the opening and closing timings of the gates<br>
of the collecting hoppers 7a, 7b and or 7c are the same as the opening and closing<br>
timings of the inner gate 22 and the outer gate 23 of the weighing hopper 4, these are<br>
merely exemplary.    For example, the control unit 20 may control the opening and<br>
closing timings of the inner gate 22 and the outer gate 23 of the weighing hopper 4 based<br>
on the opening and closing timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 7a, 7b, or 7c to<br>
make the opening and closing timings of the gates different between the collecting<br>
hoppers 7a, and 7b or 7c and the weighing hoppers 4.<br>
[0099]    By causing the combination weigher to operate in the manner as described<br><br>
above, the objects to be weighed are discharged to each of the two packaging machine<br>
inlets once in every weighing cycle time.    As a result, a productivity (total number of<br>
times the combination weigher discharges the objects to be weighed to the packaging<br>
machine) within a specified time period can be improved.<br>
Fig. 8 is a timing chart showing a second operation example of the combination<br>
weigher of the present embodiment.    In the example in Fig. 8, as in the example in Fig.<br>
2, one weighing cycle time Tw is equal to one operation cycle time.    It should be noted<br>
that two discharge combinations are determined in one combination process and the two<br>
discharge combinations discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously.<br>
[0100]    In the second operation example of the present embodiment, combination<br>
process is performed to determine two discharge combinations simultaneously once in<br>
every Tw/2 time and weighing hoppers 4 making up of the two discharge combinations<br>
determined in the combination process discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
simultaneously once in every Tw/2 time.    Also, the collecting hopper 7a and the<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously once in<br>
every Tw/2 time.    Thereby, the objects to be weighed corresponding to the two<br>
discharge combinations are fed into the packaging machine twice within one weighing<br>
cycle time Tw.    In this case, one discharge cycle time Td1 for the combination weigher<br>
is equal to 1/2 of one weighing cycle time Tw.    Also, the one discharge cycle time Tdl<br>
is equal to one packaging cycle time Tp1 of the packaging machine.    In this case, by<br>
configuring the setting so that the number of weighing hoppers 4 in each of the groups B<br>
and C is set to eleven so that the total number of weighing hoppers 4 is set to twenty two,<br>
and the number of weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected to make up of one<br>
optimal combination is set to four, higher combination weighing precision is achieved.<br>
[0101]    Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 7a and the outer<br>
chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c to open their gates simultaneously to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the packaging machine, in response to the feed command signal<br><br>
(time t1).    And, the control unit 20 causes the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up<br>
of one of the discharge combinations to open their inner gates 22 based on the operation<br>
timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 7a and, 7b, or 7c to discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed to the inner chute 6a and causes the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up<br>
of the other discharge combination to open their outer gates 23 based on the operation<br>
timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 7a and 7b or 7c to discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c (time tl).    The above operation is repeated every<br>
time the feed command signal is received as the input (time t2, time t3, ...).<br>
[0102]    In the operation shown in Fig. 8, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening the inner gates 22 at time tl are<br>
gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 7a before time t2, and the<br>
collecting hopper 7a opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time tl.    Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 by opening the outer gates 23 at time tl are<br>
gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c before time t2, and the<br>
collecting hopper 7b or 7c opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time t2.<br>
[0103]    Whereas in the operation of Fig. 8, the opening and closing timings of the gates<br>
of the collecting hoppers 7a and 7b or 7c are the same as the opening and closing timings<br>
of the inner gate 22 and the outer gate 23 of the weighing hopper 4, these are merely<br>
exemplary.    For example, the control unit 20 may control the opening and closing<br>
timings of the inner gate 22 and the outer gate 23 of the weighing hopper 4 based on the<br>
opening and closing timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 7a and 7b or 7c to<br>
make the opening and closing timings of the gates different between the collecting<br>
hoppers 7a and 7b or 7c and the weighing hoppers 4.<br>
[0104]    By causing the combination weigher to operate in the manner as described<br>
above, the objects to be weighed are discharged to each of the two packaging machine<br>
inlets once in every Tw/2 time.    As a result, a productivity within a specified time<br><br>
period can be improved, and the combination weigher can be adapted to, for example, a<br>
twin-type packaging machine operated at a high speed.<br>
[0105]    Also, the combination process may be performed once in every Tw/3 time using<br>
measured values of the weighing hoppers 4 holding the objects to be weighed whose<br>
weight values have been measured by the weight sensors 41, to determine two discharge<br>
combinations simultaneously.    And, the weighing hoppers 4 making up of the two<br>
discharge combinations determined in the combination process discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed simultaneously once in every Tw/3 time.    Correspondingly, the collecting<br>
hopper 7a and the collecting hopper 7b may be configured to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed simultaneously once in every Tw/3 time.    In this case, the objects to be<br>
weighed are discharged to each of the two packaging machine inlets once in every Tw/3<br>
time.    As a result, a productivity within a specified time period can be further improved,<br>
and the combination weigher can be adapted to, for example, the twin-type packaging<br>
machine operated at a higher speed.<br>
[0106]    Since in the present embodiment, the plurality of outer chutes 6b and 6c are<br>
disposed to surround the opening at the upper part of the inner chute 6a, as in the<br>
embodiment 1, a structure of them is relatively simple, and distances over which the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 to the<br>
outer chute 6b or 6c are transferred to the collecting hopper 7b or 7c can be made short<br>
and substantially equal irrespective of the location of the weighing hoppers 4, and all of<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 to<br>
the outer chute 6b or 6c can be gathered to the associated collecting hopper 7b or 7c in a<br>
short time irrespective of characteristics of almost the objects to be weighed.    In<br>
addition, since the collecting hopper 7a is provided at the discharge outlet 6ae at a center<br>
of the bottom part of the inner chute 6a, distances between the weighing hoppers 4 and<br>
the collecting hopper 7a are made substantially equal, and all the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 to the inner chute 6a can be<br>
gathered to the collecting hopper 7a in a short time irrespective of characteristics of<br><br>
almost the objects to be weighed.    As described above, a structure of the collecting<br>
chutes (inner chute and outer chute) can be simplified, and a time taken to transfer the<br>
objects to be weighed on the collecting chute can be reduced, irrespective of<br>
characteristics of almost all objects to be weighed, thereby enabling a high-speed<br>
operation.    Also, since the objects to be weighed belonging to the two discharge<br>
combinations are discharged simultaneously once in every Tw time, once in every Tw/2<br>
time, or once in every Tw/3 time as described above, a productivity within a specified<br>
time can be improved.    Furthermore, when the optimal combination for discharging the<br>
objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c is determined, the event that the<br>
measured value of a specified weighing hopper 4 is not used does not occur.    As a result,<br>
combination weighing precision does not degrade.<br>
[0107]    In the combination process (first combination process) shown in the flowchart<br>
of Fig. 6, the optimal combination pair in which the total of absolute values of<br>
differences between combination weight values of the respective optimal combinations<br>
and the target weight value is smallest is selected, and the two optimal combinations<br>
included in that optimal combination pair are determined as discharge combinations.<br>
Therefore, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed to be<br>
discharged can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0108]    The first combination process shown in the flowchart of Fig. 6 may be replaced<br>
by a second combination process or a third combination process as described below.<br>
[0109]    First, the second combination process will be described.    Fig. 9 is a flowchart<br>
showing the second combination process of the present embodiment.<br>
[0110]    In step S11, combination calculation is performed using measured values<br>
(weight values of the objects to be weighed) of weighing hoppers 4 holding the objects to<br>
be weighed whose weight values have been measured by the associated weight sensors<br>
41 to determine as allowable combinations, combinations in which combination weight<br>
values which are total measured values are within an allowable range with respect to a<br>
target weight value.    The process in step S11 is identical to the process of step S1 in Fig.<br><br>
6, and the optimal combination determined in step S1 corresponds to the allowable<br>
combination determined in step S11.<br>
[0111]    In step S12, specified number m (m: plural number), for example, ten allowable<br>
combinations are selected from among all the allowable combinations, by giving priority<br>
to allowable combinations in which absolute values of differences between combination<br>
weight values and the target weight value are smaller, and the selected allowable<br>
combinations are determined as first optimal combinations.<br>
[0112]    In step S13, one allowable combination in which an absolute value of difference<br>
between a combination weight value and the target weight value is smallest is selected<br>
from among allowable combinations made up of weighing hoppers 4 other than weighing<br>
hoppers 4 making up of one arbitrary first optimal combination and is determined as a<br>
second optimal combination corresponding to the one arbitrary first optimal combination.<br>
In the same manner, second optimal combinations respectively corresponding to the m<br>
first optimal combinations are determined.    In this manner, second optimal<br>
combinations respectively corresponding to the m first optimal combinations are<br>
determined and m optimal combination pairs each consisting of the associated first and<br>
second optimal combinations are determined.<br>
[0113]    In step S14, for each of the optimal combination pairs, absolute values of<br>
differences between combination weight values of the first and second optimal<br>
combinations composing the optimal combination pair and the target weight value are<br>
calculated and a total of the differences is calculated.<br>
[0114]    In step S15, one optimal combination pair in which the total of the absolute<br>
values of the differences calculated in step S14 is smallest is selected, and one of the two<br>
optimal combinations composing the pair is determined as the discharge combination<br>
(first discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute<br>
6a, and the other of the two optimal combinations is determined as the discharge<br>
combination (second discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to<br>
the outer chute 6b or 6c.    A determination method of the first and second discharge<br><br>
combinations is predetermined, and any method maybe employed.    For example, the<br>
first optimal combination may be determined as the first discharge combination and the<br>
second optimal combination may be determined as the second discharge combination, or<br>
vise versa.    Alternatively, serial numbers may be assigned to the weighing hoppers 4, an<br>
optimal combination including a weighing hopper 4 with a smallest number may be<br>
determined as the first discharge combination, and the other optimal combination may be<br>
determined as the second discharge combination, or vice versa.    Alternatively, the first<br>
and second optimal combinations may be determined according to the magnitude of the<br>
combination weight values.    For example, an optimal combination with a larger<br>
combination weight value may be determined as the first discharge combination and an<br>
optimal combination with a smaller combination weight value may be determined as the<br>
second discharge combination, or vice versa.      In a further alternative, the optimal<br>
combination with the larger combination weight value and the optimal combination with<br>
the smaller combination weight value may be alternately determined as the first and<br>
second discharge combinations, every time combination process is performed.<br>
[0115]    Whereas in steps S14 and S15, for each optimal combination pair, the total of<br>
the absolute values of the differences between the combination weight values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value is calculated, and the<br>
optimal combination pair in which the total of the absolute values of the differences is<br>
smallest is selected to determine the two discharge combinations, the total of squares of<br>
the absolute values of the differences between the combination weight values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value, may be calculated, and an<br>
optimal combination pair in which a total of the squares of the differences is smallest<br>
may be selected to determine it as two discharge combinations, for each optimal<br>
combination pair.<br>
[0116]    Subsequently, the third combination process will be described.<br>
[0117]    Initially, combination calculation is performed using measured values (weight<br>
values of the objects to be weighed) of weighing hoppers 4 holding the objects to be<br><br>
weighed whose weight values have been measured by the weight sensors 41 to determine<br>
all combinations in which combination weight values which are total measured values<br>
are within an allowable range with respect to a target weight value and determine them as<br>
allowable combinations.    Then, one allowable combination in which an absolute value<br>
of a difference between a combination weight value and the target weight value is<br>
smallest is selected from among all the allowable combinations, and is determined as a<br>
first optimal discharge combination.<br>
[0118]      Subsequently, one allowable combination in which an absolute value of a<br>
difference between a combination weight value and a target weight value is smallest is<br>
selected from among allowable combinations made up of weighing hoppers 4 other than<br>
the weighing hoppers 4 making up of the first optimal discharge combination and is<br>
determined as a second optimal combination.    One of the first optimal combination and<br>
the second optimal combination is determined as the discharge combination (first<br>
discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute,<br>
while the other is determined as a discharge combination (second discharge combination)<br>
for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute.    A determination method of<br>
the first discharge combination and the second discharge combination is predetermined<br>
as in the case of the second combination process.<br>
As in the example 1 of the embodiment 1, the size of the outer chute collecting<br>
hoppers 7b and 7c can be reduced, by configuring the setting in the first, second and third<br>
combination processes so that at least one weighing hopper 4 is selected from each of the<br>
groups B and C respectively corresponding to the outer chutes 6b and 6c to make up of<br>
the discharge combination which discharges the objects to be weighed to the outer chute<br>
6b or 6c, or a maximum number of the weighing hoppers 4 selected from each of the<br>
groups B and C is limited to less than the number of the weighing hoppers 4 which<br>
would be selected.    For example, in the first combination process, in step S2 (Fig. 6),<br>
each optimal combination pair may be determined so that at least one optimal<br>
combination includes the weighing hoppers 4 selected from both of the groups B and C.<br><br>
In the second combination process, in step S12 (Fig. 9), only an allowable combination<br>
including weighing hoppers 4 selected from both of the groups B and C may be selected<br>
to determine the first optimal combination.    Or, in step S13(Fig. 9), the second optimal<br>
combination may be selected in such a manner that, when the first optimal combination<br>
is not an allowable combination including weighing hoppers 4 in both of the groups B<br>
and C, only an allowable combination including weighing hoppers 4 selected from both<br>
of the groups B and C may be selected as a second optimal combination.    In the third<br>
combination process, the first optimal combination and the second optimal combination<br>
may be determined in such a manner that at least one of the first and second optimal<br>
combinations includes weighing hoppers 4 selected from both of the groups B and C.<br>
In the above case, in the first, second, and third combination processes, if one of the<br>
second optimal combinations selected finally includes only weighing hoppers 4 selected<br>
from the group B or C, this optimal combination may be determined as the discharge<br>
combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a and the other<br>
may be determined as the discharge combination for discharging the objects to be<br>
weighed to the outer chute 6b or 6c.<br>
[0119]    The alternate discharge operation, such as the double shift operation or the triple<br>
shift operation described in the embodiment 1 may be carried out in the configuration<br>
shown in Fig. 5.    In this case, the objects to be weighed are discharged alternately from<br>
the inner chute collecting hopper 7a and the outer chute collecting hopper 7b or 7c, and<br>
therefore the two lower chutes 8L and 8R alternately feed the objects to be weighed<br>
into two inlets of the packaging machine.    In this case, also, as in the example 1 of the<br>
embodiment 1, the size of the outer collecting hoppers 7b and 7c can be reduced, by<br>
configuring the setting so that at least one weighing hopper 4 is selected from each of the<br>
groups B and C respectively corresponding to the outer chutes 6b and 6c to make up of<br>
the discharge combination (optimal combination) or a maximum number of the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 selected from each of the groups B and C is limited to less than the number of<br>
weighing hoppers 4 which would be selected, in the combination process performed to<br><br>
determine the discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed at least to<br>
the outer chute 6b or 6c.<br>
[0120]    It is assumed that the total number of weighing hoppers 4 is fourteen, and the<br>
number of weighing hoppers 4 to be selected to make up of one discharge combination in<br>
the combination process is four, in the configuration of Fig. 5.    In this case, when the<br>
double shift operation described in the embodiment 1 is carried out, combination<br>
calculation is performed using ten measured values, and a combination in which a<br>
combination weight value is within an allowable range with respect to a target weight<br>
value, and an absolute value of a difference between the combination weight value and<br>
the target weight value is smallest, is selected as the discharge combination (optimal<br>
combination).<br>
[0121]    In contrast, in the case of the third combination process, the second optimal<br>
combination is selected from ten measured values, while the first optimal combination is<br>
always selected from fourteen measured values.    It is known that combination weighing<br>
precision increases as the number of measured values used in the combination<br>
calculation increases.    Therefore, if the total number of weighing hopers 4 is equal, then<br>
combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are to be discharged,<br>
can be improved as a whole, when using the third combination process rather than using<br>
the double shift operation.<br>
[0122]    In the second combination process, a plurality of first optimal combinations are<br>
determined under an extended condition for selecting the first optimal combination in the<br>
third combination process, the second optimal combinations respectively corresponding<br>
to the first optimal combinations are determined, and the combination pair consisting of<br>
associated two optimal combinations in which a total of absolute values of differences<br>
between combination weight values and the target weight value is smallest is selected.<br>
Therefore, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are to be<br>
discharged can be improved as a whole, when using the second combination process<br>
rather than using the third combination process.<br><br>
[0123]    In the first combination process, the optimal combination pair is formed by<br>
combining two out of all optimal combinations, and one optimal combination pair in<br>
which the total of the absolute value of the differences between the combination weight<br>
values of the two optimal combinations and the target weight value is smallest is selected.<br>
Therefore, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are to be<br>
discharged can be improved as a whole when using the first combination process rather<br>
than using the third combination process.<br>
[0124]    In accordance with the first, second, or third combination process, since the two<br>
discharge combinations are determined simultaneously, weights of the objects to be<br>
weighed corresponding to the weighing hoppers 4 larger in number can be used in the<br>
combination calculation for determining the two discharge combinations, and as a result,<br>
combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are to be discharged<br>
can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0125]    In addition, the calculation amount decreases in the order of the first<br>
combination process, the second combination process, and the third combination process,<br>
and time taken for the combination processes can be decreased in this order.<br>
[0126]    In the above described embodiments 1 and 2, in a case where the allowable<br>
range with respect to the target weight value is set to a range which is not smaller than<br>
the target weight value, that is, the lower limit value of the allowable range is set to a<br>
value equal to the target weight value, an absolute value of a difference between the<br>
combination weight value of the optimal combination or the allowable combination and<br>
the target weight value is equal to a value (difference) obtained by subtracting the target<br>
weight value from the combination weight value.    Therefore, in this case, in step S3 in<br>
Fig. 6 and in step S14 in Fig. 9, calculating the total of the absolute value of the<br>
difference between the combination weight values of the respective optimal<br>
combinations and the target weight value is equivalent to calculating the total of the<br>
differences obtained by subtracting the target weight value from the combination weight<br>
values of the respective optimal combinations.<br><br>
[0127]    In a case where the lower limit value of the allowable range is set to the target<br>
weight value, the steps S3 and S4 in Fig. 6 and the steps S14 and S15 in Fig. 9 may be<br>
replaced by the operation in which a total of combination weight values of two optimal<br>
combinations forming an optimal combination pair is calculated for each optimal<br>
combination pair, one optimal combination pair in which a calculated total is smallest is<br>
selected, one of two optimal combinations forming the selected pair is determined as a<br>
discharge combination (first discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be<br>
weighed to the inner chute, and the other is determined as a discharge combination<br>
(second discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer<br>
chute.    In this case, two discharge combinations identical to those obtained in the steps<br>
S3 and S4 and the steps S14 and S15 are obtained.<br>
[0128]    Whereas in the present embodiment, the objects to be weighed are fed to the<br>
two packaging machine inlets, the collecting hoppers 7a. 7b and 7c may be also omitted<br>
in this case, so long as all of the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
the weighing hoppers 4 slide down on the collecting chute 6a, 6b or 6 c in a short time,<br>
and therefore packaging operation of the packaging machine is not impeded.    In this<br>
case, because of the omission of the collecting hoppers, a configuration becomes simple<br>
and control therefor is unnecessary.    An example of the configuration in this case is<br>
shown in Fig. 10.    Fig. 10(a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view showing a<br>
configuration example of the combination weigher according to the present embodiment,<br>
which is not equipped with a collecting hopper as viewed from laterally, and Fig. 10(b) is<br>
a schematic view of two lower chutes and pipes in the combination weigher as viewed<br>
from above.    Pipes 10a, 10b and 10c which are tubular chutes are respectively provided<br>
at the discharge outlets 6ae, 6be, and 6bc of the collecting chutes 6a, 6b and 6c, the<br>
objects to be weighed which have slid down on the inner chute 6a are discharged to the<br>
lower chute 8L through the pipe 10a, while the objects to be weighed which have slid<br>
down on the outer chute 6b or 6c are discharged to the lower chute 8R through the pipe<br>
10b or 10c.<br><br>
[0129]    The control unit 20 may cause weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of a<br>
discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed, in response to, for<br>
example, a feed command signal from a packaging machine.    The objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 are discharged to the lower<br>
chute 8L or 8R through the collecting chute 6a, 6b or 6c and the pipe 10a, 10b, or 10c,<br>
and are fed to two packaging machine inlets.<br>
[130]    The alternate discharge operation, such as the double shift operation or the triple<br>
shift operation described in the embodiment 1 may be carried out in the configuration<br>
shown in Fig. 10.    In this case, the objects to be weighed are discharged from weighing<br>
hoppers 4 making up of discharge combinations determined sequentially, alternately to<br>
the inner chute 6a and to the outer chute 6b or 6c.    Therefore, the objects to be weighed<br>
are discharged alternately to the two lower chutes 8L and 8R through the associated pipe<br>
10a, 10b, or 10c and are fed alternately into two inlets of the packaging machine.<br>
[0131]    In the first and second embodiments, the lower chute 8, 8L or 8R, or the pipe<br>
10a, 10b or 10c may be provided at the packaging machine.<br>
[0132]    Whereas the embodiments 1 and 2 describe that only weighing hoppers 4 are<br>
used as combination hoppers which are hoppers (hoppers which participate in<br>
combination calculation) holding the objects to be weighed whose measured values are<br>
used in combination calculation, such combination hoppers are merely exemplary.    Figs.<br>
ll(a), ll(b), ll(c), and ll(d) are plan views schematically showing another examples of<br>
hoppers such as combination hoppers.    An inner chute 6X in Figs. ll(a), ll(b), ll(c),<br>
and ll(d) corresponds to the inner chute 6a in Figs. 1, 4, 5, and 10, while an outer chute<br>
6Y in Figs. ll(a), ll(b), ll(c), and ll(d) corresponds to the outer chutes 6b and 6c, or<br>
the like in Figs. 1, 4, 5, and 10.    One weight sensor 41 (see Figs. 1, 4, and 5) is attached<br>
to each of the weighing hoppers 4 in Figs. 11 (a) and ll(b) and the weighing hoppers 4X<br>
and 4Y in Figs. ll(c) and ll(d).<br>
[0133]    For example, as shown in Fig. ll(a), each weighing hopper 4 is configured to<br>
have two chambers (weighing chambers) 4a and 4b which are each fed with the objects<br><br>
to be weighed.    The two weighing chambers 4a and 4b of each weighing hopper 4 are<br>
arranged side by side substantially in the same direction as the direction in which the<br>
plurality of weighing hoppers 4 are arranged.    In this case, the feeding hopper 3 is<br>
configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the weighing<br>
chamber 4a or to the weighing chamber 4b of the weighing hopper 4.    The two<br>
weighing hoppers 4a and 4b of the weighing hopper 4 are each configured to be able to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the inner chute 6X or to the outer chute<br>
6Y.    The combination calculation is performed using weights (measured values) of the<br>
objects to be weighed inside the weighing chambers 4a and 4b of each weighing hopper 4,<br>
and the weighing chambers 4a and 4b are a candidate for a discharge combination.    In<br>
each weighing hopper 4, when only one of the weighing chambers, for example, only the<br>
weighing chamber 4a holds the objects to be weighed, the weight sensor 41 measures the<br>
weight of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing chamber 4a.    Then, when the<br>
other weighing chamber 4b is fed with the objects to be weighed, the weight sensor 41<br>
measures a total weight of the objects to be weighed inside the two weighing chambers<br>
4a and 4b.    The control unit 20 (see Figs. 1, 4 5, and 10) calculates the weight<br>
(measured value) of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing chamber 4b by<br>
subtracting the weight of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing chamber 4a from<br>
the total weight of the objects to be weighed inside the two weighing chambers 4a and<br>
4b.<br>
[0134]    In the configuration of Fig. ll(b), a memory hopper 9 is disposed below each<br>
weighing hopper 4 and has two chambers (accommodating chambers 9a and 9b) which<br>
are fed with the objects to be weighed from the weighing hopper 4.    The two<br>
accommodating chambers 9a and 9b of each memory hopper 9 are arranged side by side<br>
substantially in the same direction as the direction in which a plurality of memory<br>
hoppers 9 are arranged.    Here, the feeding hopper 3 (see Figs. 1, 4, 5, and 10) for<br>
feeding the objects to be weighed to the weighing hopper 4 is not illustrated.    In this<br>
case, the weighing hopper 4 is configured to be able to discharge the objects to be<br><br>
weighed selectively to the accommodating chamber 9a or to the accommodating chamber<br>
9b of the memory hopper 9, and not to discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer<br>
chute 6Y and to the inner chute 6X.    The two accommodating chambers 9a and 9b of<br>
each memory hopper 9 are each configured to be able to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed selectively to the inner chute 6X or to the outer chute 6Y.    Combination<br>
calculation is performed using weights (measured values) of the objects to be weighed<br>
inside the accommodating chambers 9a and 9b of each memory hopper 9 and the<br>
accommodating chambers 9a and 9b are a candidate for a discharge combination.    In<br>
this case, the weighing hopper 4 does not participate in the combination calculation.<br>
As the weights of the objects to be weighed inside the accommodating chambers 9a and<br>
9b, weights obtained by measurement in the weighing hopper 4 located thereabove are<br>
used.    Each weighing hopper 4 can participate in the combination calculation provided<br>
that the weighing hopper 4 and the accommodating chamber 9a or 9b of the associated<br>
memory hopper 9 are selected simultaneously to form a combination.    For example,<br>
when the weighing hopper 4 and the accommodating chamber 9a (or 9b) of the<br>
associated memory hopper 9 are selected simultaneously, the objects to be weighed<br>
inside the weighing hopper 4 are discharged to the outer chute 6Y or to the inner chute<br>
6X through the accommodating chamber 9a (or 9b).<br>
[0135]    In the configuration of Fig. ll(c), weighing hoppers 4X and 4Y respectively<br>
attached with the weight sensors 41 are arranged side by side in two lines, and the<br>
memory hopper 9 having one chamber fed with the objects to be weighed from the<br>
weighing hoppers 4X or 4Y is disposed below the weighing hoppers 4X and 4Y.    In this<br>
case, the feeding hopper 3 is configured to be able to selectively discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed to the weighing hopper 4X or to the weighing hopper 4Y located therebelow,<br>
the weighing hopper 4X is configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed to<br>
the memory hopper 9 or to the inner chute 6X, and the weighing hopper 4Y is configured<br>
to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the memory hopper 9 or<br>
to the outer chute 6Y.    The combination calculation is performed using weights<br><br>
(measured values) of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hoppers 4X and 4Y<br>
and inside the memory hopper 9.    The combination calculation is performed so that, for<br>
example, the weighing hopper 4Y is not selected for a discharge combination of the<br>
objects to be weighed which are discharged onto the inner chute 6X, but the weighing<br>
hopper 4X and the memory hopper 9 are selected for the discharge combination.    Also,<br>
the combination calculation is performed so that, for example, the weighing hopper 4X is<br>
not selected for a discharge combination of the objects to be weighed which are<br>
discharged onto the outer chute 6Y, but the weighing hopper 4Y and the memory hopper<br>
9 are selected for the discharge combination.    As the weight of the objects to be<br>
weighed inside each memory hopper 9, the weight obtained by measurement in the<br>
weighing hopper 4X or 4Y which has fed the objects to be weighed to the memory<br>
hopper 9 is used.    The weighing hopper 4Y can participate in the combination<br>
calculation provided that the memory hopper 9 and the weighing hopper 4Y located<br>
thereabove are selected simultaneously to form a combination, when determining the<br>
discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6X.<br>
In this case, the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hopper 4Y are discharged to<br>
the inner chute 6X through the memory hopper 9.    Likewise, the weighing hopper 4X<br>
can participate in the combination calculation provided that the memory hopper 9 and the<br>
weighing hopper 4X located thereabove are selected simultaneously to form a<br>
combination, when determining the discharge combination for discharging the objects to<br>
be weighed to the outer chute 6Y.    In this case, the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
weighing hopper 4X are discharged to the outer chute 6Y through the memory hopper 9.<br>
[0136]    In the configuration of Fig. ll(d), one feeding hopper 3 in the configuration of<br>
Fig. ll(c) has been replaced by two feeding hoppers 3X and 3Y, and hoppers which<br>
participate in the combination calculation are the same as those in the configuration of<br>
Fig. ll(c).    In this case, linear feeders 2X and 2Y are provided to respectively<br>
correspond to the feeding hoppers 3X and 3Y and respectively feed the objects to be<br>
weighed to the associated feeding hoppers 3X and 3Y, respectively.    The feeding hopper<br><br>
3X feeds the objects to be weighed to the weighing hoper 4X located therebelow, while<br>
the feeding hopper 3Y feeds the objects to be weighed to the weighing hopper 4Y located<br>
therebelow.    In this manner, since the feeding hoppers 3X and 3Y are provided to<br>
respectively correspond to the weighing hoppers 4X and 4Y, both of the two weighing<br>
hoppers 4X and 4Y forming a pair can be fed with the objects to be weighed<br>
simultaneously, if they have been selected simultaneously to make up of a discharge<br>
combination and therefore are empty.    Thereby, decrease in the number of measured<br>
values to be used in later combination calculation can be suppressed so that combination<br>
weighing precision can be improved, as compared to the configuration of Fig. ll(c).<br>
[0137]    In addition to the above described configurations, configuration of hoppers such<br>
as combination hoppers can be altered in a variety of ways.    In the configurations in<br>
Figs. 1, 4, 5, and 10, one measured value to be used in the combination calculation is<br>
obtained for each weight sensor 41 attached on the weighing hopper 4.    On the other<br>
hand, in the configuration of Fig. ll(a), two measured values to be used in the<br>
combination calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41, while in the<br>
configuration of Fig. ll(b), two measured values to be used in the combination<br>
calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41 if the weighing hopper 4 does not<br>
participate in the combination calculation and three measured values to be used in the<br>
combination calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41 if the weighing hopper 4<br>
participates in the combination calculation.    In the configurations in Figs. ll(c) and<br>
ll(d), three measured values to be used in the combination calculation are obtained for<br>
the two weight sensors 41.    Therefore, the hopper configurations shown in Figs. ll(a) to<br>
ll(d) enable efficient use of the weight sensors 41 which are expensive.    In addition, the<br>
hopper configurations shown in Figs. ll(a) to ll(d) makes it possible to suppress an<br>
