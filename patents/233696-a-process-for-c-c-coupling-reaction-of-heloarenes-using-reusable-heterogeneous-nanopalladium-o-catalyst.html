				<td>The present invention relates to a process for C-C coupling reaction of haloarenes using reusable solid support based heterogeneous nanopalladium(O) catalysts. More particularly the present invention relates to a process for C-C coupling reaction of haloarenes such as Heck, using reusable heterogeneous nanopalladium Suzuki, Sonagashira, and Stille type reactions of haloarenes by using reusable heterogeneous nanopalladium(O) catalysts on the solid support.<br>
The reusable heterogeneous nanopalladium(O) catalysts on the solid support selected from Layered double hydroxides and Merrifield resin is prepared by a procedure as claimed and disclosed in our co-pending patent application no. NF 445-02.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an eco-friendly process employing re-usable heterogeneous catalyst in place of soluble palladium catalysts for preparing coupling products by C-C bond formation reaction of haloarenes that include unreactive chloroarenes in the presence of base. The ligand free heterogeneous layered double hydroxides supported nanopalladium (LDH-Pd°) catalyst using the basic LDH in place of basic ligands indeed exhibits higher activity and selectivity in the C-C coupling reactions of haloarenes that include electron poor and electron rich chloroarenes in non aqueous ionic liquids (NAIL) over the homogeneous PdCh system. The coupling products find good applications as intermediates in the preparation of materials, natural products, and bioactive compounds.<br>
There are serious disadvantages in performing the catalytic C-C bond formation reaction with iodoarenes and bromoarenes in the manufacture of olefins due to high cost of the starting materials. Despite the synthetic elegance and high turnover number, these coupling reactions suffer from serious limitations of using the expensive bromo and<br><br>
iodoarenes that precluded the wide use in industry. By employing the heterogeneous catalytic system and chloroarenes as starting materials, the cost naturally comes down due to easy recovery of the catalyst and low cost of chloroarenes when compared with bromo and iodoarenes.<br>

heterogeneous reusable LDH-Pd(O) is used.<br>
3.	Nanopailadium catalyst, LDH-Pd(O) is prepared and used as heterogeneous catalyst for<br>
the synthesis of coupling products by C-C bond formation reactions. The use of<br>
heterogeneous nanopalladium catalyst precludes the presence of palladium in traces<br>
with the product<br>
4.	The stereoselectivity and the yields are good.<br>
5.	The work-up procedure is simple.<br>
6.	The catalyst is subjected to many recycles, which displayed consistent activity.<br>
7.	The present process is environmentally safe since there is no disposal problem.<br>
8.	The process is economical.<br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	A process of forming C-C coupling reaction of haloarenes such as herein described characterized in that using ligand free reusable nanopalladium (o) catalyst which comprises reacting haloarene with an organic reagent selected from the group consisting of olefin such as herein described, aryl boronic acid, phenyl acetylene and tin reagent in a polar solvent selected from non aqueous ionic liquid, THF, dioxane, water, NMP in the presence of base and heterogeneous nanopalladium (0) catalyst at a temperature ranging between 20 to 150°C for a period ranging from 0.5 to 48 h under nitrogen atmosphere, filtering the above said reaction mixture followed by extraction and washing the resultant mass to obtain the desired C-C coupling compounds.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the haloarene used is selected from the group consisting of chlorobenzene, 4-nitrochlorobenzene, 4-acetylchlorobenzene, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde,	4-chlorobenzophenone,	4-chloroanisole,	4-methylchlorobenzene and 4-chlorobenzylalcohol.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein the olefin used is selected from styrene and n-butylacrylate.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the aryl boronic acid used is selected from the group consisting of phenylboronic acid, 3-nitrophynylboronic acid, napthylboronic acid, 4-fluorophynylboronic acid and 4-methyl phynylboronic acid.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the tin reagent used is selected from tributyltin hydride and allyltributyl tin.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polar solvent used is selected from the group consisting of nonaqueous ionic liquid, water, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl pyrrolidinone or any mixture thereof.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claims 1-6, wherein the non-aqueous ionic liquid used is tetra-n-butlylammonioum bromide.<br>
8.	A process as claimed in claims 1-7, wherein the base used is selected from the group consisting of triethylamine, tributylamine, potassium fluoride, potassium acetate.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in claims 1-8, wherein the catalyst used is a solid support based Layered double hydroxides or Merrifield resin supported heterogeneous nanopalladium (o) catalyst.<br>
10.	A process for C-C coupling reaction of haloarenes using ligand free reusable nanopalladium (o) catalyst substantially as herein described with reference to the exaples and drawing accompanying this specification.<br></td>
