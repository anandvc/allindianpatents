DESCRIPTION<br>
AROMATIC AMINE DERIVATIVE AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT ELEMENT EMPLOYING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel aromatic amine derivatives and organic electroluminescence devices using the same, and more particularly to organic electroluminescence devices which exhibit a high luminance of light emitted and a high efficiency of light emission and have a long life, and novel aromatic amine derivatives capable of realizing such organic electroluminescence devices.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The organic electroluminescence devices (organic EL devices) are spontaneous light emitting devices which utilize the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by energy of recombination between holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode upon application of an electric field thereto.<br>
Since C. W. Tang, et al., of Eastman Kodak Company have reported organic EL devices of a laminate type driven at a low electric voltage (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, "Applied Physics Letters", Vol. 51, p. 913, 1987, etc.), many studies have been intensely conducted on organic EL devices made of organic materials.<br>
The organic EL devices reported by Tang, et al., have such a laminate structure including a light emitting layer made of<br>
tris(8-hydroxyquinolinol)aluminum and a hole transport layer made of a triphenyl diamine derivative.   The laminate structure of these devices has advantages such as increased efficiency of hole injection into the light emitting layer, increased efficiency of production of excited particles (excitons) which are produced by blocking electrons injected from a cathode and recombining the electrons with holes, and confinement of the excitons produced within the<br><br>
light emitting layer.    As the structure of such organic EL devices, there a well known a two-layer structure including a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer, a three "layer structure including a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer, etc.    In these organic EL devices of a laminate type, various structures and production methods thereof have been proposed in order to enhance an efficiency of recombination between holes and electrons injected there in to.<br>
As the light emitting materials for the organic EL devices, there are known chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum complexes, coumarin derivatives, tetraphenyl butadiene derivatives, bis-styryl arylene derivatives and oxadiazole derivatives.    It has been reported that these light emitting materials emit blue to red light in a visible range, and it is therefore expected to realize color display devices by using these light emitting materials (for example, refer to JP 8-239655A, JP 7-138561A and JP 3-200289A, etc.).<br>
In addition, JP 2001-207167A discloses the devices using aminoanthracene derivatives as a green light emitting material.    However, the light emitting material has failed to provide devices having a long life and a high efficiency of light emission and, therefore, has been practically unusable.<br>
In recent years, although many organic EL devices having a high luminance and a long life have been disclosed or reported, the performance thereof has been still unsatisfactory.   Therefore, is has been strongly demanded to develop materials for organic EL devices having a more excellent efficiency of light emission.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above problems.   An object of the present invention is to provide organic EL devices which exhibit a high luminance of light emitted and a high efficiency of light emission and have a long life, and novel aromatic amine derivatives capable of realizing such organic EL devices.<br><br>
As a result of extensive researches for developing materials for organic EL devices having the above advantageous properties as well as organic EL devices using such materials, the inventors have found that the above object can be achieved by using aromatic amine derivatives represented by the following general formula (l) in which a substituted anthracene structure is bonded to an amine structure substituted with benzene rings having substituent groups.   The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the above finding.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides-<br>

tertiary cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms; t is an integer of 1 to 9, and when t is 2 or more, a plurality of R1 groups may be the same or different;<br>

Meanwhile, in the following compounds, Me represents a methyl group.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the aromatic amine derivatives represented by the general formula (1) according to the present invention, since the substituted anthracene structure is bonded to the amine structure substituted with benzene rings having substituent groups , the association between the compounds is prevented, resulting in a prolonged life thereof.    In addition, since the anthracene skeleton has bulky substituent groups such as secondary or tertiary alkyl or cycloalkyl groups, the anthracene structure exhibits a large steric repulsion against the amine structure, so that properties of these compounds such as life can be further improved.    Further, the aromatic amine derivatives have a strong fluorescence in a solid state, and are excellent in field light emission, which leads to a fluorescent quantum efficiency as high as 0.3 or more.    In addition, the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention exhibit not only excellent capabilities of injecting holes from the metal electrode or organic thin film layers and transporting the holes, but also excellent capabilities of injecting electrons from the metal electrode or organic thin film layers and transporting the electrons , and are, therefore, usefully usable as light emitting materials for organic EL devices.    Besides, the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention may be used together with other hole transporting materials, electron transporting materials or doping materials.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention includes an anode, a cathode, and one or plural organic thin film layers.    In the case of one layer type, a light emitting layer as the organic thin film layer is provided between the anode and cathode.    The light emitting layer contains a light emitting material and may further contain a hole injecting material or an electron injecting material in order to effectively transport holes injected from the anode or electrons injected from the cathode to the light emitting material. The aromatic amine derivatives represented by the general formula (l) have a high light emitting property and excellent hole injectability and hole transportability as well as excellent electron injectability and electron transportability and, therefore, can be used as a light emitting material in the light emitting layer.<br><br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the light emitting layer contains the material for organic EL devices according to the present invention in an amount of preferably 0.1 to 20% by weight and more preferably 1 to 10% by weight.    Further, the material for organic EL devices according to the present invention exhibits not only an extremely high fluorescent quantum efficiency but also high hole transportability and electron transportability, and further are capable of forming a uniform thin film.    Therefore, the light emitting layer may be formed from only the light emitting material of the present invention.<br>
Examples of the organic EL device of a multilayer type include those having multilayer structures such as (an anode/a hole injecting layer/a light emitting layer/a cathode), (an anode/a light emitting layer/an electron injecting layer/a cathode) and (an anode/a hole injecting layer /a light emitting layer/an electron injecting layer/a cathode).<br>
The light emitting layer may also optionally contain, in addition to the compound represented by the general formula (l) according to the present invention, conventionally known materials such as light emitting materials, doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials according to requirements.    The organic EL device having such a multilayer structure can be prevented from suffering from deterioration in luminance and service life due to quenching.    If required, the light emitting materials, doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials may be used in combination with each other.   The use of the doping materials enables the resultant device to be improved in luminance of light emitted and efficiency of light emission, and further emit a red color light or a blue color light.    Further, in the organic EL device of the present invention, the hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer may respectively have a multilayer structure including two or more layers.    In this case, the multi-layer hole injecting layer may include a hole injecting layer into which holes are injected from the electrode, and a hole transporting layer for accepting the holes from the hole injecting layer and transporting the holes to the light emitting layer.   Also, the multi-layer electron injecting layer may<br><br>
include an electron injecting layer into which electrons are injected from the electrode, and an electron transporting layer for accepting the electrons from the electron injecting layer and transporting the electrons to the light emitting layer.    These respective layers may be selectively used according to various factors such as energy level of the materials used, heat resistance, and adhesion to the organic thin film layers or the metal electrodes.<br>

At least one surface of the organic EL device of the present invention preferably exhibits a sufficient transparency in a wavelength range of light emitted there from in order to enhance an efficiency of light emission thereof. Further, the substrate used in the device is also preferably transparent.    The transparent electrode is formed from the above conductive material by vapor deposition method, sputtering method, etc., so as to ensure a desirable transparency thereof.   The electrode disposed on a light emitting surface of<br><br>
