				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a direct reduction process for a metalliferous feed ma-<br>
terial, particularly, although by no means exclusively, to a direct reduction process for<br>
an iron-containing feed material, such as iron ore.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for reducing a metalliferous feed mate-<br>
rial that comprises a direct reduction process for partially reducing metalliferous feed<br>
material in the solid state and a smelting process for melting and further reducing the<br>
partially reduced metalliferous feed material to a molten metal.<br>
The present invention was made during the course of an on-going research project car-<br>
ried out by the applicant to develop the so called "CIRCOFER technology" for the direct<br>
reduction of iron ore.<br>
CIRCOFER technology is a direct reduction process that is capable of reducing iron ore<br>
in the solid state to a metallisation of 50% or higher.<br>
CIRCOFER technology is based on the use of fluidised beds. The main feed materials<br>
to the fluidised beds are fluidising gas, metal oxides (typically iron ore fines), solid car-<br>
bonaceous material (typically coal) and oxygen-containing gas (typically oxygen gas).<br>
The main product produced in the fluidised beds is metallised metal oxides, i.e. metal<br>
oxides that have been at least partially reduced.<br>
One of the findings of the applicant in the research project is that it is possible to oper-<br>
ate the process with relatively fine feed materials and minimise carry-over of iron units<br>
in an off-gas stream from the process and minimise undesirable accretions of materials,<br>
such as metal oxide fines, on exposed surfaces in the fluidised bed apparatus that are<br>
capable of disrupting the process. High carry-over of iron units in off-gas streams and<br>
undesirable accretions on exposed apparatus surfaces are significant issues for com-<br><br>
mercialisation of the CIRCOFER technology, particularly with metal oxide feed materi-<br>
als that are relatively brittle.<br>
The applicant has found that it is possible to achieve controlled agglomeration of parti-<br>
cles and minimise undesirable accretions of materials, such as metal oxides, by provid-<br>
ing a carbon-rich zone in a fluidised bed, passing metalliferous material through the<br>
zone, and injecting oxygen into the zone and oxidising smaller particles, including<br>
smaller metallised particles.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a circulating fluidized bed process for<br>
direct reduction of a solid metalliferous material having a particle size distribution that at least<br>
in part comprises micron sized particles, said process comprising: supplying the metalliferous<br>
material, a solid carbonaceous material, an oxygen-rich gas and a fluidizing gas to a vessel,<br>
whereby a fluidized bed is maintained in the vessel, the fluidized bed containing a carbon-rich<br>
zone, withdrawing gas and entrained solids from an upper section of the vessel, separating<br>
solids from the withdrawn gas, and recirculating the separated solids to the vessel, and<br>
discharging a product stream from a lower section of the vessel,<br>
wherein the step of supplying the oxygen-rich gas comprises injecting the oxygen-rich<br>
gas downwardly into the carbon-rich zone using a cooled lance spaced horizontally inward<br>
from side walls of the vessel, whereby heat is generated in the carbon-rich zone by reactions<br>
between oxygen and metallized material, the solid carbonaceous material and other oxidizable<br>
solids and gases in the fluidized bed, metalliferous material is at least partially reduced in a<br>
metal-rich zone below the carbon-rich zone, and the product stream discharged from the vessel<br>
comprises the at least partially reduced metalliferous material, and<br>
wherein the process involves controlling agglomeration of particles by adjusting at least<br>
one of feed rate of the metalliferous material, feed rate of the carbonaceous material and feed<br>
rate of the oxygen-rich gas.<br>
The term "carbon-rich" zone is understood herein to mean a region in the fluidised bed<br>
in which there is a relatively large amount of carbon-containing material in relation to<br>
the amount of metalliferous material than there is in other regions of the fluidised bed.<br>
The applicant does not have a totally clear understanding at this stage of the mecha-<br>
nism or mechanisms that enables controlled agglomeration of metalliferous material to<br>
be achieved. Nevertheless, without wishing to be bound by the following comments, in<br>
the research project the applicant observed that the agglomerates that formed com-<br>
prise smaller particles, particularly fines, adhered to each other and to larger particles.<br>
The applicant speculates that the conditions in the carbon-rich zone, and more particu-<br><br>
tarty a hot zone within the carbon-rich zone, are such that (a) micron sized partially and<br>
completely reduced, i.e. metallised, iron ore particles react with oxygen and generate<br>
heat and the resultant oxidised particles become sticky (b) fine coal particles react with<br>
oxygen and oxidise and the resultant ash becomes sticky; and (c) fine iron ore particles<br>
become sticky as a consequence of being heated. The applicant also speculates that<br>
these smaller sticky particles, adhere to larger particles that have a higher heat sink<br>
capacity, with the overall beneficial result that there is a reduction in the proportion of<br>
smaller particles in the vessel that can adhere to apparatus surfaces and be carried out<br>
from the vessel in an off-gas stream.<br>
Preferably the process comprises supplying the metalliferous material in the form of<br>
fines.<br>
In the case of reducing metalliferous material in the form of iron ore fines, preferably<br>
the fines are sized at minus 6 mm.<br>
Preferably the fines have an average particle size in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 mm.<br>
One of the advantages of the process is that it can accept a substantial amount of met-<br>
alliferous feed material with a grain size of less than 100 microns without a significant<br>
amount of this material exiting the process entrained in off-gas. This is believed to be<br>
due to an agglomeration mechanism operating within the fluidised bed that promotes a<br>
desirable level of agglomeration between particles of feed materials, particularly sub-<br>
100 micron particles, without appearing to promote uncontrolled agglomeration capable<br>
of interrupting operation of the fluidised bed. Similarly, friable ores that have a ten-<br>
dency to break down during processing and to thereby increase the proportion of parti-<br>
cles in the fluidised bed with a size of less than 100 microns may be processed without<br>
significant loss of feed material in process off-gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises supplying the metalliferous material with a selected<br>
maximum particle size and controlling agglomeration so that 90% of the particles di-<br>
scharged from the process as a product stream do not exceed the maximum selected<br>
feed size.<br><br>
Preferably the process comprises supplying the metalliferous material with a selected<br>
maximum particle size and controlling agglomeration so that no more than 30%, prefe-<br>
rably no more than 20%, and more preferably no more than 10% by weight of the total<br>
weight of iron units discharged from the process is carried off in an off-gas stream from<br>
the process.<br>
Preferably the process comprises controlling agglomeration by adjusting the feed rates<br>
of any one or more of the metalliferous material, the carbonaceous material, the reacti-<br>
on temperature and the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
More preferably the process comprises controlling agglomeration by adjusting the feed<br>
rate of the carbonaceous material.<br>
The process has considerable advantages.<br>
By way of example, it has hitherto been thought that CIRCOFER technology requires<br>
amounts of carbon that are at least 20-30% by weight of the total weight of solids in a<br>
fluidized bed to prevent uncontrolled agglomeration leading to undesirable accretions<br>
on exposed surfaces of fluidized bed apparatus that disrupts the process.<br>
The applicant has found that it is possible to operate the process with minimal undesir-<br>
able accretions and with desirable controlled agglomeration with relatively low levels,<br>
typically 5-30%, of carbonaceous material. Low levels of carbonaceous material<br>
means that it is possible to produce a solids product stream with low levels of char and<br>
the product stream can be supplied into smelters with minimal downstream processing.<br>
In addition, controlled agglomeration of metalliferous material fines into larger particles<br>
that become part of the solid products stream rather than being carried out of the proc-<br>
ess as entrained solids in an off-gas stream means that there is higher recovery from<br>
the process and less downstream treatment of off-gas required. This is a particularly<br>
important benefit for iron ores that tend to be brittle and would break down into micron<br>
sized particles in the course of materials handling prior to being supplied to the vessel<br><br>
and during the course of being processed in the vessel. Such brittle ores include ores<br>
mined in Western Australia, such as Brockman and Mara Maba ores.<br>
On current indications, typically the process can reduce minus 3mm iron ore fines with<br>
the following results.<br>
At least 90% by weight of the iron ore fines supplied to the process being metallised to<br>
some extent and discharged as part of a solids product stream, with less than 50% of<br>
the fines being greater than 2mm.<br>
In the range of 5-30% by weight of the solids product stream comprising carbon.<br>
Less than 20% by weight of the iron ore fines supplied to the process being discharged<br>
from the process with off-gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas into a central<br>
region of the vessel, ie a region that is located inwardly of a side wall of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas so that there is a<br>
downward flow of the gas in the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas with a downward<br>
flow in a range of plus or minus 40 degrees to the vertical.<br>
More preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen with a downward flow in a<br>
range of plus or minus 15 degrees to the vertical.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas via at least one<br>
lance having a lance tip with an outlet positioned in the vessel inwardly of the side wall<br>
of the vessel in the central region of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the lance tip is directed downwardly.<br>
More preferably the lance tip is directed vertically downwardly.<br><br>
The position of the lance and, more particularly, the height of the outlet of the lance tip,<br>
is determined by reference to factors, such as the oxygen-containing gas injection velo-<br>
city, the vessel pressure, the selection and amounts of the other feed materials to the<br>
vessel, and the fluidised bed density.<br>
Preferably the process comprises water-cooling the lance tip to minimise the possibility<br>
of accretions forming on the lance tip that could block the injection of the oxygen-<br>
containing gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises water cooling an outer surface of the lance.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas through a central<br>
pipe of the lance.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas with sufficient<br>
velocity to form a substantially solids-free zone in the region of the outlet of the lance<br>
tip to minimise the formation of accretions that could block the injection of the oxygen-<br>
containing gas.<br>
Preferably the oxygen is injected with a velocity in the range 50-300 m/s.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting nitrogen and/or steam and/or other suitable<br>
shrouding gas and shrouding the region of the outlet of the lance tip to minimise oxida-<br>
tion of metal that could result in accretions forming on the lance tip that could block the<br>
injection of the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the shrouding gas into the vessel at a velo-<br>
city that is at least 60% of the velocity of the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
In one embodiment the process comprises establishing reaction zones in a fluidised<br>
bed and moving solids (including metalliferous and carbonaceous materials) and fluidis-<br>
ing gas within the bed so that the solids pass through the reaction zones.<br><br>
The reaction zones may be contiguous.<br>
One reaction zone is the carbon-rich zone described above.<br>
The other reaction zone is a metal-rich zone in which metalliferous material, such as<br>
iron ore, is reduced in a solid state.<br>
The term "metal-rich" zone is understood herein to mean a region in the fluidised bed in<br>
which there is a relatively large amount of metalliferous material in relation to the<br>
amount of carbon-containing material than there is in other regions of the fluidised bed.<br>
The metal-rich zone is located in a lower section of the fluidised bed and the carbon-<br>
rich zone is located above the metal-rich zone.<br>
The zones may be contiguous.<br>
The fluidised bed comprises upward and downward movement of solids through the<br>
zones.<br>
Preferably the process comprises supplying the metalliferous material, the carbonace-<br>
ous material, the oxygen-containing gas, and the fluidising gas to the fluidised bed and<br>
maintaining the fluidised bed with (a) a downward flow of the oxygen-containing gas,<br>
(b) an upward flow of solids and fluidising gas countercurrent to the downward flow of<br>
the oxygen-containing gas, and (c) a downward flow of solids outwardly of the upward<br>
flow of solids and fluidising gas.<br>
In the fluidised bed described in the preceding paragraph, solids in the upward and<br>
downward flows of solids are heated by heat generated by reactions between the oxy-<br>
gen-containing gas, the carbonaceous material and other oxidisable materials (such as<br>
CO, volatiles, and H2) in the carbon-rich zone. The solids in the downward flow of so-<br>
lids transfer heat to the metal-rich zone.<br><br>
In addition, the upward and downward flows of solids shield the side wall of the vessel<br>
from radiant heat generated by reactions between the oxygen-containing gas and the<br>
solid carbonaceous material and other oxidisable solids and gases in the fluidised bed.<br>
Preferably the carbonaceous material is coal. In such a situation, the process devolati-<br>
lises the coal to char and at least part of the char reacts with oxygen and forms CO in<br>
the fluidised bed. Coal volatiles also decompose to gases such as CO and H2, which in<br>
turn may further react with oxygen in the fluidised bed.<br>
Preferably the fluidising gas comprises a reducing gas, such as CO and H2.<br>
Preferably the process comprises selecting the amount of H2 in the fluidising gas to be<br>
at least 15% by volume of the total volume of CO and H2 in the gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises discharging the product stream comprising at least<br>
partially reduced metalliferous material from the lower section of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the product stream also comprises other solids (for example char).<br>
Preferably the process comprises separating at least a portion of the other solids from<br>
the product stream.<br>
Preferably the process comprises returning at least a portion of the other solids to the<br>
vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises discharging an off-gas stream containing entrained<br>
solids from an upper section of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises separating at least a portion of the entrained solids<br>
from the off-gas stream.<br><br>
Preferably the process comprises maintaining a circulating fluidised bed by separating<br>
entrained solids from the off-gas stream and returning at least a portion of the separa-<br>
ted solids to the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises returning solids separated from the off-gas to the<br>
lower section of the fluidised bed.<br>
Preferably the process comprises preheating metalliferous feed material with the off-<br>
gas from the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises treating the off-gas after the preheating step and re-<br>
turning at least a portion of the treated off-gas to the vessel as the fluidising gas.<br>
Preferably the off-gas treatment comprises one or more of (a) solids removal, (b) coo-<br>
ling, (c) H2O removal; (d) CO2 removal, (e) compression, and (f) reheating.<br>
Preferably the off-gas treatment comprises returning solids to vessel.<br>
The process may be operated to produce a product stream ranging from low to high<br>
metallisation depending on the downstream requirements for the at least partially redu-<br>
ced metalliferous material. The metallisation may range from 30 to In excess of 80%.<br>
In situations in which metallisation greater than 50% is required, preferably the process<br>
comprises operating with reducing gas in the fluidising gas. One option for the fluidi-<br>
sing gas in this instance is treated off-gas from the vessel. In situations in which metal-<br>
lisation less than 50% is required, it is envisaged that it will not be necessary to operate<br>
with reducing gas in the fluidising gas and sufficient reductant can be obtained via solid<br>
carbonaceous material supplied to the process.<br>
The oxygen-containing gas may be any suitable gas.<br>
Preferably the oxygen-containing gas comprises at least 90% by volume oxygen.<br><br>
The present invention is described further with reference to the accompany drawing<br>
which is a diagram of an apparatus for direct reduction of a metalliferous material by<br>
one embodiment of a process in accordance with the present invention which illustrates<br>
the reaction zones formed by the process within the vessel shown in the Figure.<br>
The following description is in the context of direct reduction of metalliferous material in<br>
the form of iron ore in the solid state. The present invention is not so limited and ex-<br>
tends to direct reduction of other iron-containing materials (such as ilmenite) and more<br>
generally to other metalliferous materials.<br>
The following description is also in the context of direct reduction of iron ore with coal<br>
as a solid carbonaceous material, oxygen as an oxygen-containing gas, and recycled<br>
off-gas containing a mixture of CO and H2 as a fluidising gas. The present invention is<br>
not so limited and extends to the use of any other suitable solid carbonaceous material,<br>
oxygen-containing gas, and fluidising gas.<br>
With reference to the Figure, solid feed materials, namely iron ore (typically fines sized<br>
to less than 6 mm) and coal, oxygen and fluidising gas are supplied to the vessel 3<br>
shown in the Figure and establish a fluidised bed in the vessel.<br>
The solid feed materials are supplied to the vessel via a solids delivery device such as<br>
a screw feed or a solids injection lance 5 that extends through a side wall 7 of the ves-<br>
sel.<br>
The oxygen is injected into the vessel via a lance 9 that has a lance tip 11 with an out-<br>
let that directs the oxygen downwardly in a central region of the vessel, ie spaced in-<br>
wardly from the side wall 7 of the vessel. The lance tip is directed downward in the<br>
vessel. The fluidising gas is injected via a series of tuyeres or nozzles (not shown) in a<br>
base 13 of the vessel.<br>
The above-described supply of solids and gases produces the following reactions in the<br>
vessel.<br><br>
Devolatilisation of coal fines to char and decomposition of coal volatiles to gaseous<br>
products (such as CO and H2) and reaction of at least part of the char with oxygen to<br>
form CO.<br>
Direct reduction of iron ore to at least partially reduced iron by the CO, H2, which reac-<br>
tions produce CO2 and H2O.<br>
Reaction of CO2 with carbon to form CO (Boudouard reaction).<br>
Oxidation of solids and gases, such as partially reduced iron ore particles, char, coal<br>
volatiles, CO, and H2 (injected as a part of the fluidising gas or produced through de-<br>
composition of coal volatiles) with oxygen which generates heat that assists with main-<br>
taining the reactions described in the preceding dot points and which also contributes<br>
to a desirable controlled agglomeration of the smaller reduced ore particles to form lar-<br>
ger reduced ore particles.<br>
The relative densities of the solids and the above-described injection of the solids and<br>
the gases, including the locations of the solids/gas injection, results in the formation of<br>
reaction zones in the vessel. The zones may be contiguous.<br>
One reaction zone is a carbon-rich zone 17 in the region of the lance tip 11 of the lance<br>
9, i.e. in an intermediate section of the vessel in terms of height. In this zone the pre-<br>
dominant reactions are oxidising reactions involving combustion of metallised material,<br>
char, coal volatiles, CO, and H2 with oxygen which generate heat, particularly in a hot<br>
zone 51 in the immediate vicinity of the lance tip 11.<br>
The other reaction zone is a metal-rich zone 19 in a lower section of the vessel in which<br>
(a) coal is devolatilised and forms char and coal volatiles and (b) iron ore fines are at<br>
least partially reduced and thereby metallised by CO and H2.<br>
The above-described supply of solids and gases produces an upward flow of fluidising<br>
gas and entrained solids in the central region of the vessel. Increasingly, as the solids<br>
move upwardly, the solids disengage from the upward stream of fluidising gas and flow<br><br>
downwardly in an annular region between the central region and the side wall of the<br>
vessel. Recirculated solids are either entrained again in the upward stream of fluidis-<br>
ing gas or are discharged from the vessel. The movement of solids transports the sol-<br>
ids through the hot zone 51 and the smaller particles, particularly metallised micron<br>
sized particles become sticky and adhere to other particles, particularly larger particles.<br>
As is indicated above, this agglomeration of smaller particles provides substantial ad-<br>
vantages.<br>
The upward stream of fluidising gas and entrained solids in the central region of the<br>
vessel 3 is countercurrent to the downward flow of oxygen gas and is believed to result<br>
in the entrainment of some of the solids in the oxygen gas; The interaction of the<br>
counter current flows of fluidising gas and oxygen is believed to limit the extent to which<br>
solids entrained in or passing through the oxygen flow can contact vessel surfaces and<br>
cause accretions. The formation of accretions is believed to be further limited due to<br>
the central location of the flow of oxygen gas within the vessel.<br>
The above-described downward flow of solids in the annular region between the central<br>
region and the side wall facilitates transfer of heat from the carbon-rich zone to the<br>
metal-rich zone.<br>
In addition, the downward flow of solids partially shields the side wall from direct expo-<br>
sure to radiant heat from the central region of the vessel.<br>
The above-described process also produces a stream of off-gas and entrained solids<br>
that is discharged from the vessel via an outlet 27 in an upper section of the vessel.<br>
The off-gas stream is processed by separating solids from the off-gas and returning the<br>
separated solids to the vessel via a solids return leg 29. Thereafter, the off-gas is<br>
treated by a series of steps including (a) removal of solids, (b) cooling the off-gas, (c)<br>
H2O removal, (d) CO2 removal, (e) compression, and (f) reheating.<br>
The treated off-gas is thereafter returned to the vessel as part of the fluidising gas.<br><br>
The above-described process produces a stream of solids, including at least partially<br>
reduced iron ore and char, that is discharged from the vessel via an outlet 25 in the<br>
base of the vessel.<br>
The solids stream may be processed by separating the at least partially reduced iron<br>
ore and at least part of the other solids. The other solids, predominantly char, may be<br>
returned to the vessel as a part of the solids feed for the process. The at least partially<br>
reduced iron ore is further processed as required. By way of example, the at least par-<br>
tially reduced iron ore may be supplied to a molten bath-based smelting vessel and<br>
smelted to molten iron, for example by a process such as the so called "Hlsmelt proc-<br>
ess".<br>
As is indicated above, the present invention was made during the course of an on-<br>
going research project carried out by the applicant to develop CIRCOFER technology<br>
for the direct reduction of iron ore. The research project included a series of pilot plant<br>
runs on 350mm diameter and 700mm diameter pilot plant set-ups of the applicant.<br>
The following discussion focuses on research work on the 700 mm diameter vessel<br>
pilot plant.<br>
The pilot plant comprises an apparatus of the type shown in Figure 1 and 2. The pilot<br>
plant was operated as a circulating fluidised bed at atmospheric pressure. The vessel<br>
has a height of 10.7 m. An upper section of the vessel has a height of approximately<br>
8.9 m and an internal diameter of 700 mm. A lower section of the vessel has a height<br>
of approximately 1.8m and an internal diameter of 500 mm. This height of 1.8 m inclu-<br>
des the height of a fluidising grate and a transition section between the 500 mm diame-<br>
ter and the 700 mm diameter sections. The vessel is refractory lined.<br>
Off-gas from the vessel was processed to remove entrained solids by passing the off-<br>
gas successively through 3 cyclones connected in series. The first cyclone (cyclone 1)<br>
received off-gas directly from the vessel. Solids separated in the cyclone were re-<br>
turned to the vessel via a seal pot that provided for pressure sealing. The second cyc-<br>
lone (cyclone 2) received off-gas from cyclone 1. Solids separated in the cyclone were<br><br>
returned to the vessel via a direct return of solids (i.e. no seal pot). The third cyclone<br>
(cyclone 3) received off-gas from the second 2. Solids separated by cyclone 3 were<br>
not returned to the vessel.<br>
After solids separation by the three cyclones, the off-gas was further treated by a radial<br>
flow scrubber, which further removed solids from the off-gas. These solids were con-<br>
centrated by a thickener and then passed through a drum filter to produce thickener<br>
sludge.<br>
Off-gas leaving the radial flow scrubber was then treated by a tube cooler that operated<br>
to dewater the off-gas by cooling it to within the range 10-30°C. Following treatment by<br>
the tube cooler, the off-gas was combusted.<br>
The fluidised bed was fluidised by air during the initial stages of testing and was later<br>
fluidised by a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen gas. As there were no provisions for<br>
processing and recycling the process off-gas, e.g. CO2 removal and compression, it<br>
was not possible for it to be returned to the vessel as fluidising gas. In this regard,<br>
hydrogen gas was used to simulate the effect of using processed off-gas as fluidising<br>
gas.<br>
In summary, the research work demonstrated the following:<br>
The concept of a coal based fluidised bed reduction process with oxygen injection, pro-<br>
ducing a reduced product with metallisation levels of up to 78%.<br>
Injecting oxygen into/or close to a fluidised bed with up to 42% metallic iron in the bed<br>
appears to be feasible without the formation of accretions.<br>
The concept of simultaneously reducing iron ore and partially burning coal for energy in<br>
a single bed vessel appears to be feasible, at metallic iron loadings up to 48% in the<br>
product.<br><br>
The position of the oxygen lance in the vessel is important because of the desirability of<br>
transferring the heat of oxidation back into the bed while minimising the level of iron re-<br>
oxidation. The 4-m position is about right for the conditions tested.<br>
High phosphorus Brockman iron ore was successfully fluidised and reduced without<br>
excessive dust make. (Brockman ore is a friable West Australian iron ore made avail-<br>
able by Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, Perth, Western Australia.)<br>
Objectives of the experimental program:<br>
The primary objective was to achieve stable operation for a significant amount of time<br>
with high phosphorus Brockman ore (-3mm) and Blair Athol coal.<br>
The plan was to operate with low iron ore feed (up to 20% in product discharge) for two<br>
days with the oxygen lance in a low position (1.9-m above the distributor plate (not<br>
shown in the Figure) of the vessel. The aim was then to operate for three days with<br>
high ore feed (up to 70% in the product) with the oxygen lance in an upper position<br>
(3.8-m above the distributor plate).<br>
Start-up:<br>
The campaign started on the 9th of December 2003 at 0600 hrs with a gradual heat up<br>
of the 700-mm vessel (hereinafter also referred to as a "CFB") using alumina as the<br>
bed material. Once the target temperature was reached, coal and oxygen were intro-<br>
duced into the vessel at 1550 hrs. The oxygen rate was increased up to 105 Nm3/hr<br>
while the coal rate was in the range 300-450 kg/hr.<br>
Operation with coal and oxygen 10/12/03 - 11/12/03<br>
Operation with coal, air and oxygen was conducted on 10/12/03. The operation was<br>
very smooth with the system stabilising fairly quickly and the vessel maintaining its<br>
temperature of 900-930°C without any problems.<br><br>
The standard operating conditions during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperature: 930°C bottom and 900°C top<br>
Fluidising gas flowrate: 140Nm3/hr (N2) and 300Nm3/hr (air)<br>

The discharge product was clean with only some small +2mm pieces which looked like<br>
residual refractory material. The dust make was reasonably low with 
charge reporting to the final cyclone discharge.<br>

simulate use of processed off-gas as fluidising gas. The operation was smooth with the<br>
bed AP being maintained at about 100-120 mbar and the temperature profile having a<br>
range of only 10°C between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br><br>
The product appeared fine without any signs of accretions or agglomerates. However,<br>
on screening the product (at 2mm) some larger scale type material was found but this<br>
was only a very small proportion of the overall product. The scale appeared to be<br>
made up of ash/char and probably formed on the walls of the vessel or distributor plate<br>
in the vessel.<br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>

The iron ore feed rate was increased up to 20 kg/hr at 0600 on 11/12/03 until 1200<br>
11/12/03 and the hydrogen gas rate was also increased up to 40 Nm3/hr. The operation<br>
continued to be smooth without any disruptions. The vessel bed pressure was being<br><br>
maintained at about 80-100 mbar and the temperature profile had a range of only 10°C<br>
between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates. As before the only exception to this was the odd piece of scale type<br>
material, which appeared to be composed of ash/char.<br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>

Summary:<br>
The iron ore feed rate was increased up to 40 kg/hr at 1200 on 11/12/03 and operated<br>
with this rate until 0600 12/12/03, while the hydrogen gas rate was maintained at 40<br>
Nm3/hr and the coal rate was around 360-420 kg/hr. The operation continued to be<br>
smooth without any disruptions and the iron product discharge was highly metallised.<br>
Dust make was also low with less than 10% of the total discharge coming from the final<br>
cyclone (i.e. cyclone 3). The vessel bed AP was being maintained at about 90-135<br>
mbar and the temperature profile had a range of less than 10°C between the bottom<br>
and the top of the bed.<br>
Results<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>

A summary of the results is as follows:<br>
Bed Discharge Rate: 190-210 kg/hr<br>
Cyclone 3 Discharge: 15-20 kg/hr<br>
Offgas Analysis<br><br><br>
The high metallisation achieved (70-77%) indicates that the oxygen lance (even at its<br>
1.9-m position) did not penetrate too far to the bottom of the bed and that there was<br>
good segregation within the bed. The lower part of the bed is iron rich. The higher part<br>
of the bed is carbon rich and this is interacting with the oxygen lance to generate heat<br>
and this heat is then transferred back into the bed by the recirculation of the solids to<br>
the lower parts of the bed. The low CO/CO2 ratio in the off-gas indicates achievement<br>
of high post combustion, with the energy levels being transferred back into the bed,<br>
while maintaining high metallisation levels in the product discharge.<br><br>
The iron levels in the product and the degree of metallisation indicates that the 700-mm<br>
vessel can be operated in gasification mode with up to 20-25% metallic iron content<br>
without any problems with accretions. This is a significant achievement.<br>
Oxygen Lance Inspection (12/12/03)<br>
The lance was taken out of the 700-mm vessel and inspected on 12/12/03.<br>
In summary, the lance was clean. The water cooled pipe as well as the nozzle tip had<br>
no evidence of any buildup of material.<br>
The lance was repositioned in the vessel at a higher position i.e. 3.8-m above the dis-<br>
tributor plate. The vessel was restarted with coal and oxygen and then once stabilised<br>
iron ore and hydrogen.<br>

13/12/03 0600 - 13/12/03 1200: Iron Ore at 110 kg/hr<br>
Summary;<br>
The iron ore feed rate was increased stepwise up to 110 kg/hr at 0625 on 13/12/03 and<br>
operated with this rate until 1200 13/12/03 while the hydrogen gas rate was also in-<br>
creased stepwise up to 110 Nm3/hr over a 2 hr period. The coal rate was around 360-<br>
400 kg/hr. The operation continued to be smooth without any disruptions and the iron<br>
product discharge from the vessel was up to 78% metallised. Dust make was also low<br>
with 
vessel bed AP was being maintained at about 90-135 mbar and the temperature profile<br>
had a range of less than 5°C between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
Increasing the lance height from 1.9m to 3.8m did not seem to impact on the bed tem-<br>
perature profile. In fact, the temperature spread was less than 5°C from top to bottom.<br><br>
Results:<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates.<br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperatures: 953°C bottom and 951°C top<br>
Ruidising gas flowrate CFB 10 Nm3/hr (N2) at 860°C, 110 Nm3/hr (N2) at 740°C, 180<br>
Nm3/hr (N2) at 680°C. and 110 Nm3/hr (H2) at 860°C<br>

A summary of the results is as follows:<br>
Bed Discharge Rate: 162 kg/hr<br>
Cyclone 3 Discharge: 16 kg/hr<br>
Offgas Analysis<br><br><br>
With the higher oxygen lance position the uniform bed temperature profile of the lower<br>
lance was maintained. This indicates that even with the oxygen lance at the 3.8m posi-<br>
tion the solids recirculation profile is such that enough heat is transferred back into the<br>
bottom of the bed.<br>
The temperature profile in the vessel and the cyclones indicated that there was proba-<br>
bly no increase in dust make with the increase in iron ore feed rate up to 110 kg/hr.<br>
The discharge from the final cyclone relative to the vessel also did not change signifi-<br>
cantly. This suggests that either the iron ore is not breaking down as much as predicted<br>
or that any fines generated are re-agglomerated in the high temperature region of the<br>
oxygen lance.<br>
13/12/03 1200-16/12/03 0500: Iron Ore at 120 - 230 kg/hr<br>
Summary:<br>
For the first period of this operation from 17:00 13/12/03 to 12:00 15/12/03 the opera-<br>
tion rate was approximately 120 kg/h iron ore feed. This included a period of distur-<br>
bance where there was no feed. The final period operated at approximately 230 kg/h<br>
iron ore feed.<br>
The operation with 230 kg/hr iron ore feed rate was smooth without any disruptions and<br>
the iron product discharge from the CFB ranged from 48% to 78% metallised. Dust<br>
make was also low at 
bed AP was being maintained at about 80-100 mbar and the temperature profile range<br>
had now increased to about 20°C between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
Operating the vessel at the higher iron ore feed rate of 200 kg/hr increased the range of<br>
the CFB temperature profile with the bottom part of the bed now being up to 20°C<br>
colder than the middle of the bed. The metallisation levels were also lower at the<br>
higher iron ore feed rates but they were still in the 60-80% metallisation range.<br><br>
Results:<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates.<br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperatures: 947°C bottom and 960°C top<br>
FB gas heater temperature: 740°C and 615°C main heater<br>
Fluidising gas flowrate CFB: 20 Nm3/hr (N2) at 840°C, 100 20 Nm3/hr (N2) at 740°C,<br>
185 20 Nm3/hr (N2) at 615°C, and 140 Nm3/hr (H2) @ 840°C<br>
Pressure drop CFB: 83-96 mbar<br>
Oxygen flowrate: 113 Nm3/hr<br>
N2 shield gas flowrate: 30-40 Nm3/hr<br>

Iron Ore Feed Rate: 200 kg/hr<br>
A summary of the results is as follows:<br>
Bed Discharge Rate: 227-286 kg/hr<br>
Cyclone 3 Discharge: 18-24 kg/hr<br>
Offgas Analysis (0400 hrs 15/12/03)<br><br><br><br><br>
At the high iron ore feed rates (200 kg/hr) the discharge from the vessel increased sig-<br>
nificantly while the discharge from the final cyclone only increased slightly. However,<br>
the discharge from the final cyclone relative to the vessel did not seem to change. It<br>
was further observed that the amount of fines 
the amount of fines 
breaking down as much as predicted or that any fines generated are re-agglomerated<br>
in the high temperature region of the oxygen lance. The temperature profile through<br>
the cyclones also supports this since there were no significant increases in tempera-<br>
tures through the cyclone system at the higher iron ore feed rates. The product metal-<br>
lisation levels were maintained in the range of 68-78% during the high iron ore feed<br>
rates while the product discharge had up to 48% metallic iron.<br>
Oxygen Lance and Vessel Inspection (16/12/03 and 19/12/03)<br>
The lance was taken out of the 700-mm vessel and inspected on 16/12/03. In sum-<br>
mary, the lance was fairly clean. The water cooled pipe had a thin coating of material<br>
while the nozzle tip was relatively clean. The nature of the build up (flaky and thin)<br>
suggested that this would not lead to any operational problems.<br>
Iron Distribution &amp; Agglomeration<br>
Analysis of the Brockman ore sample used as feed to the fluidised bed indicated a fines<br>
content of approximately 10.6% sub 45 micron. These units were expected to appear<br>
as output from cyclone 3 or as thickener sludge. Due to the friable nature of Brockman<br>
Ore, it was expected that additional fines would be produced during processing. It was<br>
therefore expected that the percentage of iron units exiting the system through cyclone<br>
3 would exceed 10.6%.<br>
It was observed that approximately 7% of the iron units input to the fluidised bed were<br>
discharged through cyclone 3, either as direct output from cyclone 3 (approximately<br>
4%) or as output from the radial flow scrubber (approximately 3%). Analysis of the<br>
main product output from the fluidised bed indicated that an agglomeration mechanism<br>
was present within the process. This mechanism appeared to be primarily smaller par-<br><br>
tides, typically sub 100 micron particles, agglomerating to each other and to larger par-<br>
ticles.<br>
Many modifications may be made to the embodiments of the present invention shown<br>
in the Figure without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>

33.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the metalliferous material is supplied to the<br>
vessel with a selected maximum particle size and agglomeration of the particles is controlled so that no<br>
more than 10% by weight of the total weight of iron units discharged from the process is carried off in<br>
an off-gas stream from the process.<br><br><br>
A direct reduction process for a solid metalliferous material having a particle size distribution that at least in part comprises<br>
micron sized particles, comprises supplying the metalliferous material, a solid carbonaceous material, an oxygen-containing<br>
gas, and a fluidizing gas into a fluidized bed in a vessel and maintaining the fluidized bed in the vessel, at least partially reducing<br>
metalliferous material in the vessel, and discharging a product stream that comprises the at least partially reduced metalliferous<br>
material from the vessel. The process is characterized by: (a) establishing and maintaining a carbon-rich zone within the fluidized<br>
bed; (b) passing metalliferous material, including metallised material (which term includes partially metallised material), through<br>
the carbon-rich zone; and (c) injecting the oxygen-containing gas into the carbon-rich zone and oxidizing metallised material, solid<br>
carbonaceous material and other oxidisable solids and gases and causing controlled agglomeration of particles.<br></td>
