CLEANSING WIPE ARTICLE<br>
2. Applicant(s)<br>
(a)	NAME : HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY : a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and<br>
having its registered office at<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a personal cleansing article in wipe format having improved foaming properties.<br>
Personal cleansing and conditioning products have traditionally been marketed in a variety of forms such as bars, liquids and gels.  These formats have attempted to satisfy a number of criteria for acceptability to consumers. Among them are cleansing effectiveness, skin feel, mildness and lather volume.  Ideal products should gently cleanse the skin or hair, cause little or no irritation, and not leave the skin or hair overly dry after frequent use.<br>
A series of granted and pending patent applications have been published by Procter &amp; Gamble describing disposable personal cleansing products addressing many of the aforementioned functionality concerns. These products are substantially dry articles having deposited onto a woven or non-woven cloth a cleansing composition of surfactant, structurant, skin conditioning agent and other performance ingredients.  The technology is described in the following patents.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,951,991 (Wagner et al.) focuses on providing the substrate with a conditioning emulsion separately impregnated from the lathering surfactant onto the cloth substrate.  U.S. Patent 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.) emphasizes impregnation of oil soluble conditioning agents. WO 99/55303 (Albacarys et al.) describes skin care actives formulated with the cleansing composition.<br>
2<br><br>
Another approach to cleansing is reported in U.S. Patent 6,063,390 (Farrell et al.).  Therein are disclosed cosmetic wiping articles based upon a pouch formed by at least one water permeable wall and containing an effervescent cleanser composition in the form of an anhydrous dry powder. Effervescence and foaming is achieved by a powdered combination of alkaline material, acid material and a surfactant.  A variety of skin benefit agents can be included to improve afterfeel properties.  Illustrative are deposition aids such as cationic guar gums including guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride in amounts ranging up to about 1% by weight.<br>
A general problem with dry cleansing wipe articles is a tendency for foam not to last too long.  Systems have been sought which would extend the foam phenomena.<br>
In a first aspect, a substantially dry personal care cleansing article is provided which includes:<br>
(i)  a water insoluble substrate;<br>
(ii) a personal care composition adjacent the substrate, which includes:<br>
(a)	from about 0.5 % to about 60 % of at least one lathering surfactant by weight of the composition;<br>
(b)	from about 2 % to about 15 % of a cationic polymer by weight of the composition; and<br>
(c)	a carrier for the lathering surfactant and cationic polymer, the composition having an average particle size ranging from about 75 to about 900 microns.<br>
3<br><br>
Now it has been discovered that cationic polymers can extend foam duration in substantially dry lathering wiping articles.  The improvement is achieved with at least about 2 % cationic polymer by weight of the personal care composition, these levels being significantly higher than those normally utilized in such systems.  Typical levels in commercial products are kept considerably below l %, usually about 0.3 % - 0.5 %, and function as deposition aids or conditioners rather than as foam enhancing agents.  Further, it has been found that the compositions must have an average particle size within the range from about 75 to about 900 microns, preferably from about 100 to about 500 microns, optimally from about 180 to about 400 microns.<br>
Thus, an important element of the personal care composition component of wiping articles according to the present invention is that of a cationic polymer.  Amounts of the polymer may range from about 2 % to about 15 %, preferably from about 3 % to about 10 %, optimally from about 4 % to about 8 % by weight of the personal care composition.<br>
Cationic polymers suitable for purposes of this invention may be selected from cellulose derived and synthetic polymers.<br>
Cellulose Derived Polymers; by cellulose derived polymers is meant any polymer containing a cellulose backbone, i.e. a polysaccharide.  In these cellulose derived polymers, the hydroxy groups of the cellulose polymer have been hydroxyalkylated (preferably hydroxyethylated or hydroxypropylated) to form a hydroxyalkylated cellulose,<br>
4<br><br>
which is then further modified with a cationic quaternary ammonium or protonated ammonium group.  Preferred cationic modifying groups are those having at least one C10-20 alkyl chain and two shorter alkyl chains (i.e. Ci or C2) on the nitrogen.  The substituent on the cellulose polymer can thus be depicted as -(X)NRR'R" wherein X is hydroxyalkyl<br>
(preferably-OCH2CH2- or -OCH2CHOHCH2-), R and R' are methyl<br>
or ethyl, and R" is C10-20 alkyl [preferably lauryl, stearyl, or cocoyl (i.e. a mixture of alkyl groups derived from coconut oil)].  In other alternative structures, it has been found that when R, R', and R" are all methyl (i.e. the<br>
trimonium group) that useful cellulose polymers are also obtained. In yet other alternative structures, the cationic substituent on the cellulose contains both a hydroxyethyl and a hydroxypropyl group such that the moiety can be<br>
depicted as - (OCH2CH20) -CH2CHOHCH2NRR' R" wherein R, R', and<br>
R" are methyl or ethyl, and R" is C10-20 alkyl [preferably lauryl, stearyl, or cocoyl (i.e. a mixture of alkyl groups derived from coconut oil)], or alternatively wherein R, R' ,<br>
and R" are all methyl (i.e. the trimonium group).<br>
Commercially available cationic modified celluloses include laurdimonium hydroxyethyl cellulose (wherein in the above<br>
formula X is -OCH2CH2-, R and R' are methyl, and R" is lauryl), and steardimonium hydroxyethyl cellulose (wherein in the above formula X is -OCH2CH2-, R and R' are methyl, . and R" is stearyl).  These materials are known by the trade<br>
5<br><br>
names CRODACEL QL and CRODACEL AS, which are all commercially available from Croda Corp. Another highly useful cationic cellulose is laurdimonium hydroxypropyl oxyethyl cellulose (wherein the modifying group on the<br>
cellulose is - (OCH2CH20) -CH2CHOHCH2NRR' R" , wherein R, R' are<br>
methyl and R" is lauryl), which is commercially available as CRODACEL QL SPECIAL, from Croda Corp.<br>
Other useful cationic celluloses are available from Amerchol Corp. (Edison, N.J., USA) as POLYMER JR, LR, and LK series which are salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 10; and the polymeric quaternary ammonium salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with lauryl dimethyl ammonium-substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 24, which are available from Amerchol Corp. (Edison, N.J., USA) under the tradename POLYMER LM-200.<br>

Other materials include quaternary nitrogen-containing cellulose ethers (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat.<br>
6<br><br>
No. 3,962,418) and copolymers of etherified cellulose and starch (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,958,581).<br>
Related to these cellulose polymers are ones having backbones that are derived from other sugars (or their related acids, alcohols, amines, etc), e.g. galactose, mannose, arabinose, xylose, fructose, fructose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, 5 or 6 membered ring polyalcohols, and mixtures therof.<br>

Furthermore, the non-woven substrate can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>
Non-woven substrates may be comprised of a variety of materials both natural and synthetic. By "natural" is meant that the materials are. derived from plants, animals, insects<br>
14<br><br>
or byproducts.  By "synthetic" is meant that the materials are obtained primarily from various man-made materials or from material that is usually a fibrous web comprising any of the common synthetic or natural textile-length fibers, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of natural materials useful in the present invention are silk fibers, keratin fibers and cellulosic fibers.  Non-limiting examples of keratin fibers include those selected from the group consisting of wool fibers, camel hair fibers, and the like.  Non-limiting examples of cellulosic fibers include those selected from the group consisting of wood pulp fibers, cotton fibers, hemp fibers, jute fibers, flax fibers, and mixtures thereof.<br>

The water insoluble substrates of the present invention can comprise two or more layers, each having a different texture and abrasiveness. The differing textures can result from the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate layers of the substrate can be manufactured to have different colors, thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces.<br>
The amount of personal care composition relative to the substrate may range in weight from about 20:1 to 1:20, preferably from 10:1 to about 1:10 and optimally from about 2:1 to about 1:2 by weight.<br>
Although the present invention can operate with single substrate wiping articles, the preferred use is with a sachet enclosing an effervescent personal care cleansing<br>
17<br><br>
composition.  The latter is in the form of a substantially anhydrous powder including an alkaline material and an acid material which together when wetted with water liberate carbon dioxide.  Formulated with the powder is at least one lathering surfactant and the cationic polymer which enhances rapidity and duration of foaming.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the sachet in a form of a pouch is constructed of at least one water permeable wall. A preferred embodiment of the pouch includes one wall which is formed of a spunlace substrate and a second wall formed of a meltblown composite substrate, the latter being bonded to a high loft sheet.  The powdered effervescent personal care cleansing composition is dosed into the pouch, and the walls ultrasonically sealed to ensure no loss of the powdered composition.  Copious foam is generated when the pouch is wetted with water, much in the same manner as a toilet bar is lathered.<br>
When the personal care composition is an effervescent system, there will be an acidic material present.  Suitable for this purpose are any acids, and preferably those<br>
present in dry solid form. Especially appropriate are C2-C20<br>
organic mono- and poly- carboxylic acids and especially<br>
alpha- and beta- hydroxycarboxylic acids; C2-C20<br>
organophosphorus acids such as phytic acid; C2-C20 organosulfur acids such as toluene sulfonic acid; and peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide. Typical hydroxycarboxylic acids include adipic, glutaric, succinic, tartaric, malic, maleic, lactic, salicylic and citric acids<br>
18<br><br>
as well as acid forming lactones such as gluconolactone and glucarolactone.  Most preferred is citric acid.<br>
Also suitable as acid material may be encapsulated acids. Typical encapsulating material may include water soluble synthetic or natural polymers, such as polyacrylates (e.g. encapsulating polyacrylic acid), cellulosic gums, polyurethane and polyoxyalkylene polymers.  By the term "acid" is meant any substance which when dissolved in deionized water at 1 % concentration will have a pH of less than 7, preferably less than 6.5, optimally less than 5.<br>
These acids preferably at 25°C are in solid form, i.e. having melting points no less than 25°C.  Concentrations of the acid should range from about 0.5 % to about 80 %, preferably from about 10 % to about 65 %, optimally from about 20 % to about 45 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
For an effervescent type personal care cleansing composition within the pouch, an alkaline material must be present. The alkaline material is a substance which can generate a gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen or oxygen, i.e. effervesce, when contacted with water and the acidic material.  Suitable alkaline materials are anhydrous salts of carbonates and bicarbonates, alkaline peroxides (e.g. sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate) and azides (e.g. sodium azide).  Preferably the alkaline material is sodium or potassium bicarbonate.  Amounts of the alkaline material may range from about 1 % to about 80 %, preferably from about 5 % to about 49 %, more preferably from about 15 % to about 40 %, optimally from about 20 % to about 35 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
19<br><br>
By the term "substantially anhydrous" or "substantially dry" is meant the presence of no more than about 25 %, preferably no more than about 10 %, more preferably no more than about 5 %, and optimally no more than 1 % of water by weight of the composition or article, respectively.  Water of hydration is not considered to be water for purposes of the anhydrous definition.  However, it is preferred to minimize, preferably to eliminate any water of hydration.<br>
Advantageously the combined amount of acidic and alkaline materials will be at least about 1.5 %, preferably from about 40 % to about 95 %, optimally from about 60 % to about 80 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
A variety of skin benefit agents may be included to improve afterfeel properties.. Advantageously these substances will be available as substantially anhydrous dry powders. Alternatively these substances may be liquids deposited upon or into a powdered substrate (e.g. calcium silicate or zeolite) to achieve a resultant dry flowing powder.<br>
Within the skin benefit agent scope are several categories of materials.  These include emollients, antiaging actives, antibacterials and fungicides, skin lighteners, sunscreens and combinations thereof.

25<br><br>
Polysaccharides useful in this invention are dry solid anhydrous substances such as sorbitol, sugars, (such as trehalose), starches, modified starches (e.g. aluminum octenyl succinate) and mixtures thereof.  Most preferred is sorbitol.<br>
Advantageously an emotive agent such as a fragrance and/or botanical extract are included with the effervescent cleansing composition.  Fragrances and botanicals are often liquids.  For this reason it may be necessary to uniformly distribute and allow absorption of liquid components into the solid powder. One method of best achieving this is to spray these liquids onto the solids. Amounts of the fragrance and/or botanicals combined may be at levels from about 0.1 % to about 3 %, preferably from 0.5 % to 2 %, optimally from 0.8 % to 1.5 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
Colorants may also be included in compositions of the present invention.  These substances may range from about 0.05 % to about 5 %, preferably between 0.1 % and 3 % by weight.<br>
Examples<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material are to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>

The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive.<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate embodiments of this invention.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Example 1<br>
A personal care cleansing article of the effervescent type was prepared according to the following method with reference to the formulation reported in Table I.  Phase A was dry blended in a high speed shearing mixer.  Phase C was then formed by mixing mineral oil, vitamin A palmitate, vitamin E acetate, sunflower seed oil, green tea extract and fragrance, which combination was then sprayed with agitation onto calcium silicate.  Thereafter Phase A and C were combined with mixing.  Phase B was then incorporated with the other two phases and mixing continued for twenty minutes.  The resultant dry blend was then fed into a<br>
Chilsonator® which processed the dry blend powder between<br>
high pressure rollers resulting in a compacted ribbon.<br>
A Fitz Mill was utilized to grind the ribbon into small particles.  These particles were then sifted with the very fine and very large particles being recycled back into the<br>
Chilsonator .  Particles ranging in average size from about<br>
27<br><br>
75 to about 900 micron were separated and dosed at 2.9 grams to pouches.  The pouches were formed from a layer of spunlace substrate and a second wall of SMS to which a high loft sheet was sealed.  All sides of the pouch were welded by ultrasonic heat to ensure against powder escaping.<br>

Example 2<br>
A lather duration time (LDT) test was performed on the formulation reported in Table I, except that the levels of<br>
28<br><br>
Jaguar C-13SW were varied from 0 to 7 %.  The test procedure was as follows.<br>
A plastic tub (35 cm x 25 cm) was positioned adjacent a sink. A bath mat with one approximately 1 cm width hole was placed into the tub with the smoother side (no ridges) facing upwards.<br>
A cheesecloth (30 cm x 25 cm) was folded to achieve a double layer.  This cloth was placed over a 400 ml beaker. Both beaker and cloth were tared on a balance.  The cheesecloth was then removed from the beaker and secured over another 400 ml beaker with a rubberband.<br>
The personal care cleansing effervescent article of Example l was placed 6 inches from the faucet head of the sink. Water at 35-38°C and flow rate of 9000 ml/minute was allowed to wet the article for 5 seconds. The opposite side of the article was then wetted for another 5 seconds. The article was then placed into the plastic container on top of the bath mat and allowed to remain for 5 seconds.<br>
The article was then gently tapped with a mixer head in an up and down motion for 15 seconds.  Thereafter the article oriented at a 45° angle was rubbed by hand in a circular motion on the bath mat for 30 seconds. The side of the article being rubbed was alternated every 5 seconds. Excess lather was removed from fingers and hands directly onto the cheesecloth.<br>
29<br><br>
The bath mat was lifted allowing excess lather to be scraped from either side of the article with a spatula. All of the lather was gently transferred to the cheesecloth.  Then the lather was scraped to the bottom of the plastic tub and the lather from the tub poured over the cheesecloth.<br>
The cheesecloth was removed from beaker and draped over the other beaker which had previously been tared.  The amount of lather on the cheesecloth was then recorded.<br>
The article was re-wetted briefly on either side and allowed to remain on the bath mat for 5 seconds.  The foregoing process was repeated beginning with the gentle tapping of the article with a mixer head. The re-wetting/lather cycle was continued until the non-woven no longer dispensed any lather.<br>
Results of the tests are recorded in the Tables below.<br><br>

Each set represents a repeat evaluation. The results recorded in the Tables above demonstrate a steady increase of lather duration time as the Jaguar concentration rises from 3 % to 7 %.  Indeed, the increased duration is almost twice as much as found in the 0 % formula.<br>
Example 3<br>
Another personal care cleansing article of the effervescent type is prepared having the composition reported in Table II.  Phase A is dry blended in a high speed shearing mixer. Fragrance is then sprayed onto the resultant powder as a Phase B.  Only those particles with average particle size from 75 to 900 micron are employed for the cleansing composition. These are separated by sifting through a set of wire screens.  Three grams of the selected sifted powder are then placed into a 5 by 7.5 cm square pouch formed of non-woven rayon/polyester. All sides are closed by thermal heat sealing.<br>

This example presents experiments correlating average particle size with foam enhancement.  These experiments utilized the formulation reported in Table I except that<br>
levels of Jaguar C-13S® were varied between 0 % to 7 % by<br>
weight.<br>
The personal care cleansing articles of Example 1 were held at 15 cm from a faucet head of a sink. Water at 35-38°C and at a flow rate of 9,000 ml/minute were allowed to wet the article for 5 seconds on one side.  The opposite side was then wetted for an additional 5 seconds.  Thereafter the article was transferred to a small plastic tray and placed<br>
under an Instron® model 4501 tester.<br>
33<br><br>
The Instron 4501u was set for speed of 250 mm/minute and<br>
settings were made at -21 mm and touch set 6.1.  The work utilized to deflate the article (i.e. billowed pouch) at a set distance was calculated by integrating an area under a<br>
force vs. distance curve generated by the Instron®.  Results<br>
are reported in Table III.<br>
