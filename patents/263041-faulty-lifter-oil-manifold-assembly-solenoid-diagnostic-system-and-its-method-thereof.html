FIELD OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The present Invention relates to a faulty lifter oil manifold assembly solenoid diagnostic system and its method<br>
thereof. In particular, it relates to displacement on demand internal combustion engines and more specifically to<br>
detecting a faulty solenoid that deactivates cylinders of the internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An increased demand for more fuel efficient engines without compromising performance has led to the development<br>
of displacement on demand (DoD) internal combustion engines. DoD engines include a control system that<br>
deactivates cylinders under low load conditions and reactivates cylinders under high load conditions. For example, an<br>
eight cylinder engine can operate using four cylinders to improve fuel economy by reducing pumping losses but can<br>
use all eight cylinders when more power is required such as during acceleration. A DoD engine is in an activated<br>
mode when using all of the cylinders.<br>
In the deactivated mode, there are less cylinders operating. As a result, there is less drive torque available to drive<br>
the vehicle driveline and accessories (e.g., alternator, coolant pump, A/C compressor). Engine efficiency, however, is<br>
increased as a result of decreased fuel consumption (i.e., no fuel supplied to the deactivated cylinders) and decreased<br>
engine pumping. Because the deactivated cylinders do not take in fresh intake air, pumping losses are reduced.<br>
A lifter oil manifold assembly (LOMA) is implemented to activate and deactivate select cylinders of the engine. The<br>
LOMA includes a series of solenoids associated with corresponding cylinder. The solenoids are selectively energized to<br>
enable hydraulic fluid flow to switchable lifters to inhibit valve operation, thereby deactivating the corresponding<br>
cylinders. In the event of a solenoid failure, mechanical damage may occur to the engine. Therefore, it is<br>
advantageous to detect a faulty solenoid quickly to prevent possible engine damage.<br>
One method to detect a faulty solenoid is to monitor for an electrical short or an open circuit. However, this method<br>
will only detect an electrical failure of the solenoid without regard to a mechanical failure such as a stuck solenoid.<br>
DE000010108425 recites an arrangement for the indirect monitoring of an electromagnetic valve (1), comprises a<br>
switching circuit which controls the valve using a voltage, and an evaluation and control unit. The time the voltage is<br>
applied to the valve is measured and used as an input function. Differentiating units differentiate at least one input<br>
function and a comparator is used to detect at least one zero point differentiated input function. A monostable<br>
member picks up the zero point and a display shows deviations between the voltage pulse intervals and the<br>
predetermined time intervals.<br>
DE102004034296 discloses the device has an electromagnet (1) with a core (1.2) and a stimulation coil (1.1), an<br>
armature (2) and spring element (5) and a yoke (1.3) extending in the armature's direction of motion and connected<br>
to the core. The armature has a polarized permanent magnet (2.2) enclosed by upper and lower armature plates<br>
(2.3,2.1) in a sandwich construction that contacts the yoke at least with one end of the upper plate and there is a<br>
secondary air gap (3) between one end of the lower plate and the yoke.<br><br>
DE102004056653 discloses the method involves a magnetic armature whose magnetic coil is subjected to electrical<br>
voltage and the magnetic coil evaluates the direction of flow of the electric current. The magnetic coil is subjected to<br>
an increased starting voltage during the first time interval and a lower maintenance voltage during the second time<br>
interval. The armature is switched from the starting voltage to the maintenance voltage if the current flow drops<br>
below a given value within a given length of time. An independent claim is also included for the switching<br>
arrangement.<br>
DE000019719602 discloses the invention relates to an electronic control unit for controlling an electromagnetic valve<br>
having an armature, in particular for a heating and/or air conditioning installation in a motor vehicle. The circuit has<br>
an electronic switch element (8) which is mounted in a row with the valve coil. Said switch element (8) is<br>
characterized in that it controls the valve voltage (29) (or valve current (44)) at the coil (12) in such a way that, when<br>
the valve is switched in, the valve voltage (29) reaches a first value (U1). The valve voltage (29) is then brought back<br>
to a second value (U2) which is less than the first value (U1). The valve voltage (29) then takes on a third value (N)<br>
which is greater than the second value (U2) and represents a withstand voltage for maintaining the armature (13) in<br>
its switch-on position.<br>
DE000010040207 discloses detector senses current dip and outputs status signal when magnet and armature<br>
engages by applying voltage to coil (4). Sensor senses current in coil and outputs signal (44) in response to which<br>
peak track and hold circuit outputs track signal (72) that tracks signal (44). The signal (44) is passed through resistor<br>
(83) to output signal (45). Level shifter shifts level of signals (72) and outputs signal (80). Signals (44,80) are<br>
compared to output status signal (84), when signal (45) drops below signal (80). An Independent claim is also<br>
included for DC electromagnetic clutch.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A diagnostic system that detects a faulty liter oil manifold assembly solenoid according to the present invention<br>
includes a current measurement module, a time delay module, a voltage measurement module, and a diagnostic<br>
module. The current measurement module measures current flowing through the solenoid when a trigger signal is<br>
enabled. The time delay module determines a time delay based on the measured current. The voltage measurement<br>
module measures a supply voltage that powers the solenoid. The diagnostic module determines whether the solenoid<br>
is faulty based on the time delay and supply voltage. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method<br>
for detecting a faulty lifter oil manifold assembly solenoid comprising step of measuring current flowing; through the<br>
solenoid when a trigger signal is enabled; determining a time delay based on said measured current; measuring a<br>
supply voltage that powers the solenoid; and determining whether the solenoid is faulty based on said time delay and<br>
said supply voltage.<br>
In other features, the time delay is based on a transition of a slope of the measured current. The time delay is a<br>
period of time between the transition of the slope and when the trigger signal is enabled. The diagnostic module<br>
determines that the solenoid is faulty when the time delay is greater than an upper time threshold or lower than a<br>
lower time threshold. The upper and lower time thresholds are based on the supply voltage.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred<br>
embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended<br>
to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity,<br>
the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a<br>
processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit,<br>
and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that drives a transmission 14. The transmission 14 is either<br>
an automatic or a manual transmission that is driven by the engine 12<br>
through a corresponding torque converter or clutch 16. Air flows into<br>
the engine 12 through a throttle 17. The engine 12 includes N<br>
cylinders 18. One or more select cylinders 18' are selectively<br>
deactivated during engine operation. Although Figure 1 depicts eight<br>
cylinders (N = 8), it is appreciated that the engine 12 may include<br>
additional or fewer cylinders 18. For example, engines having 4, 5, 6,<br>
8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated. Air flows into the engine<br>
12 through an intake manifold 20 and is combusted with fuel in the<br>
cylinders 18. The engine also includes a lifter oil manifold assembly<br>
(LOMA) 22 that deactivates the select cylinders 18', as described in<br>
further detail below.<br><br>
[0021] A controller 24 communicates with the engine 12 and<br>
various inputs and sensors as discussed herein. A vehicle operator<br>
manipulates an accelerator pedal 26 to regulate the throttle 17, More<br>
particularly, a pedal position sensor 28 generates a pedal position<br>
signal that is communicated to the controller 24. The controller 24<br>
generates a throttle control signal based on the pedal position signal.<br>
A throttle actuator (not shown) adjusts the throttle 17 based on the<br>
throttle control signal to regulate air flow into the engine 12.<br>
[0022] The vehicle operator manipulates a brake pedal 30 to<br>
regulate vehicle braking. More particularly, a brake position sensor 32<br>
generates a brake pedal position signal that is communicated to the<br>
controller 24. The controller 24 generates a brake control signal based<br>
on the brake pedal position signal. A brake system (not shown) adjusts<br>
vehicle braking based on the brake control signal to regulate vehicle<br>
speed. An engine speed sensor 34 generates a signal based on<br>
engine speed. An intake manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 36<br>
generates a signal based on a pressure of the intake manifold 20. A<br>
throttle position sensor (TPS) 38 generates a signal based on throttle<br>
position.<br>
[0023] When the engine 12 enters an operating point to<br>
enable the deactivated mode, the controller 24 transitions the engine<br>
12 to the deactivated mode. In an exemplary embodiment, N/2<br>
cylinders 18 are deactivated, although one or more cylinders may be<br>
deactivated. Upon deactivation of the select cylinders 18', the<br>
controller 24 increases the power output of the remaining or activated<br>
cylinders 18. The inlet and exhaust ports (not shown) of the<br>
deactivated cylinders 18' are closed to reduce pumping losses.<br><br>
[0024] The engine load is determined based on the intake<br>
MAP, cylinder mode, and engine speed. More particularly, if the MAP<br>
is below a threshold level for a given RPM, the engine load is deemed<br>
light and the engine 12 could possibly be operated in the deactivated<br>
mode. If the MAP is above the threshold level for the given RPM, the<br>
engine load is deemed heavy and the engine 12 is operated in the<br>
activated mode. The controller 24 controls the LOMA 22 based on the<br>
solenoid control, as discussed in further detail below.<br>
[0025] Referring now to Figure 2, an intake valvetrain 40 of<br>
the engine 12 includes an intake valve 42, a rocker 44 and a pushrod<br>
46 associated with each cylinder 18. The engine 12 includes a<br>
rotatably driven camshaft 48 having a plurality of valve cams 50<br>
disposed therealong. A cam surface 52 of the valve cams 50 engage<br>
lifters, discussed in detail below, and the pushrods 46 to cyclically open<br>
and close intake ports 53 within which the intake valves 42 are<br>
positioned. The intake valve 42 is biased to a closed position by a<br>
biasing member (not illustrated) such as a spring. As a result, the<br>
biasing force is transferred through the rocker 44 to the pushrod 46,<br>
causing the pushrod 46 to press against the cam surface 52.<br>
[0026] As the camshaft 48 is caused to rotate, the valve cam<br>
50 induces linear motion of the corresponding pushrod 46. As the<br>
pushrod 46 is induced to move outward, the rocker 44 is caused to<br>
pivot about an axis (A). Pivoting of the rocker 44 induces movement of<br>
the intake valve 42 toward an open position, thereby opening the intake<br>
port 53. The biasing force induces the intake valve 42 to the closed<br>
position as the camshaft 48 continues to rotate. In this manner, the<br>
intake port 53 is cyclically opened to enable air intake.<br><br>
[0027] Although the intake valvetrain 40 of the engine 12 is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2, it is appreciated that the engine 12 also includes<br>
an exhaust valvetrain (not shown) that operates in a similar manner.<br>
More specifically, the exhaust valvetrain includes an exhaust valve, a<br>
rocker and a pushrod associated with each cylinder 18. Rotation of the<br>
camshaft 48 induces reciprocal motion of the exhaust valves to open<br>
and close associated exhaust ports, as similarly described above for<br>
the intake valvetrain.<br>
[0028] The LOMA 22 provides pressurized fluid to a plurality<br>
of lifters 54 and includes solenoids 56 (shown schematically)<br>
associated with select cylinders 18' (see Figure 1). The select<br>
cylinders 18' are those that are deactivated when operating the engine<br>
12 in the deactivated mode. The lifters 54 are disposed within the<br>
intake and exhaust valvetrains to provide an interface between the<br>
cams 50 and the pushrods 46. More specifically, the lifters 54<br>
selectively induce linear motion in the corresponding pushrods 46. In<br>
general, there are two lifters 54 provided for each select cylinder 18'<br>
(one lifter for the intake valve 42 and one lifter for the exhaust valve). It<br>
is anticipated, however, that more lifters 54 can be associated with<br>
each select cylinder 18' (i.e., multiple inlet or exhaust valves per<br>
cylinder 18'). The LOMA 22 further requires a pressure sensor 58 that<br>
generates a pressure signal indicating a pressure of a hydraulic fluid<br>
supply to the LOMA 22. It is anticipated that one or more pressure<br>
sensors 58 can be implemented.<br>
[0029] Each lifter 54 associated with the select cylinders 18'<br>
is hydraulically actuated between first and second modes. The first<br>
and second modes respectively correspond to the activated and<br>
deactivated modes. In the first mode, the lifter 54 provides a<br>
mechanical connection between the cam 50 and the pushrod 46. In<br>
this manner, the cam 50 induces linear motion of the lifter 54, which is<br>
transferred to the pushrod 46. In the second mode, the lifter 54<br><br>
functions as a buffer to provide a mechanical disconnect between the<br>
cam 50 and the pushrod 46. Although the cam 50 induces linear<br>
motion of the lifter 54, the linear motion is not transferred to the<br>
pushrod 46. A more detailed description of the lifters 54 is presently<br>
foregone as lifters and their operation are known to those of skill in the<br>
art.<br>
[0030] The solenoids 56 selectively enable hydraulic fluid<br>
flow to the lifters 54 to switch the lifters 54 between the first and second<br>
modes. Although there is generally one solenoid 56 associated with<br>
each select cylinder 18' (i.e., one solenoid for two lifters), it is<br>
anticipated that more or fewer solenoids 56 can be implemented. Each<br>
solenoid 56 actuates an associated valve 60 (shown schematically)<br>
between open and closed positions. In the closed position, the valve<br>
60 inhibits pressurized hydraulic fluid flow to the corresponding lifters<br>
54. In the open position, the valve 60 enables pressurized fluid flow to<br>
the corresponding lifters 54 via a fluid passage 62. The pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flow is provided to the LOMA 22 from a pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid source.<br>
[0031] Although not illustrated, a brief description of an<br>
exemplary solenoid is provided herein to provide a better<br>
understanding of the present invention. The solenoids 56 generally<br>
include an electromagnetic coil and an armature that is disposed<br>
coaxially within the coil. The armature provides a mechanical interface<br>
between the solenoid 56 and a mechanical element, such as the valve<br>
60. The armature is biased to a first position relative to the coil by a<br>
biasing force. The biasing force can be imparted by a biasing member,<br>
such as a spring, or by a pressurized fluid. The solenoid 56 is<br>
energized by supplying current to the coil, which induces magnetic<br>
force along the coil axis. The magnetic force induces linear movement<br>
of the armature to a second position. In the first position, the armature<br>
holds the valve 60 in its closed position to inhibit pressurized hydraulic<br><br>
fluid flow to the corresponding lifters. In the second position, the<br>
armature actuates the valve 60 to its open position to enable<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid flow to the corresponding lifters.<br>
[0032] A faulty solenoid detection system 64 monitors<br>
voltage supplied to the solenoid 56 and current drawn by the solenoid<br>
56. Using these two parameters, the faulty solenoid detection system<br>
64 determines whether the solenoid 56 is responding properly. If the<br>
solenoid 56 is not responding properly, the faulty solenoid detection<br>
system 64 reports a fault.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Figure 3, the faulty solenoid<br>
detection system 64 includes a current measurement module 66, a<br>
calculate time delay module 68, a diagnostic module 70, and a voltage<br>
measurement module 72. A voltage supply 74 supplies power to the<br>
solenoid 56 when a trigger signal 76 is enabled. The current<br>
measurement module 66 measures the flow of current through the<br>
solenoid 56 when the trigger signal 76 has been enabled. The<br>
calculate time delay module 68 calculates how much time has elapsed<br>
between the enablement of the trigger signal 76 and the fully advanced<br>
movement of the solenoid 56. The calculate time delay module 68<br>
uses current measurements from the current measurement module 66<br>
to determine when the solenoid 56 is fully advanced. The diagnostic<br>
module 70 uses the time delay calculation from the calculate time delay<br>
module 68 and a voltage measurement from the voltage measurement<br>
module 72 to determine whether the solenoid has a fault 78.<br>
[0034] Referring now to Figure 4, an exemplary embodiment<br>
of the current measurement module 66 incorporating a low side current<br>
measurement scheme includes a transistor 80, a voltage amplifier 82,<br>
and an analog to digital (A/D) converter 84. The transistor 80 is a n-<br>
channel metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (NMOS) and<br>
acts as a switch that allows current to flow when the trigger signal 76 is<br>
enabled. Although the transistor 80 is shown as an NMOS transistor,<br><br>
any switching method enabled by the trigger signal 76 may be used in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
[0035] When the transistor 80 is enabled, a voltage drop is<br>
created across a shunt resistor 85 that is connected to the source of<br>
the transistor 80 and ground. The voltage drop across the shunt<br>
resistor 85 is a representation of current flowing through the solenoid<br>
56.<br>
[0036] The voltage amplifier 82 is connected to the source of<br>
the transistor 80 and ground. The voltage amplifier 82 is used to scale<br>
the voltage drop across the shunt resistor 85 to a level required by an<br>
input of the A/D converter 84.<br>
[0037] The input of the A/D converter 84 is connected to the<br>
output of the voltage amplifier 82. The A/D converter 84 receives an<br>
analog signal from the voltage amplifier 82 and converts it to a digital<br>
signal. The digital signal is additionally scaled by the A/D converter 84<br>
to correspond to the measured current of the solenoid 56. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the A/D converter samples the output of the<br>
voltage amplifier at a rate of 5000 samples per second. The output of<br>
the A/D converter 84 is connected to the calculate time delay module<br>
68 allowing for the use of the digital signal in calculating the time delay<br>
of the solenoid 56.<br>
[0038] Figure 5 is a graphical representation of current<br>
flowing through the solenoid 56. The top graph 86 corresponds to the<br>
actual current flowing through the solenoid 56. The bottom graph 88<br>
corresponds to the digital current readings from the current<br>
measurement module 66. In both graphs 86 and 88, the trigger signal<br>
76 occurs at approximately 50 ms and a "valley" exists at<br>
approximately 60 ms. The "valley" in the current readings corresponds<br>
to the armature of the solenoid 56 hitting a mechanical stop. The time<br>
delay is the difference in time between the trigger signal 76 and the<br>
"valley" of the current readings.<br><br>
[0039] In the bottom graph 88, state 0 describes the state of<br>
the solenoid 56 before the trigger signal 76 is commanded, state 1<br>
describes the state of increasing solenoid current, state 2 describes<br>
decreasing solenoid current, and state 3 describes increasing solenoid<br>
current after the armature of the solenoid 56 has hit the mechanical<br>
stop. The time delay is the time elapsed between the state 0 to state 1<br>
transition and the state 2 to state 3 transition.<br>
[0040] The time of the state 0 to state 1 transition is the time<br>
that the trigger signal 76 is activated. However, the time for the<br>
remaining transitions is calculated by inspection of the current signal.<br>
In state 1, the current signal increases and has a positive slope. In<br>
state 2, the current signal decreases and has a negative slope. The<br>
state 1 to state 2 transition is when the current slope changes from<br>
positive to negative. Since state 3 has an increasing slope, the state 2<br>
to state 3 transition is determined by the time at which the current slope<br>
changes from negative to positive.<br>
[0041] As is commonly known, the derivative of a function<br>
represents the slope of the function. In a discrete domain, an adequate<br>
approximation of the derivative of the current signal can be calculated<br>
in order to determine the slope. Several numerical methods may be<br>
employed to achieve this objective. The simplest is a two-point<br>
backward difference approximation of the derivative. The two-point<br>
backward difference approximation uses the following equation:<br><br>
where / is the approximate derivative of the current signal, y„ is the<br>
present sample of the current signal, yn_x is the previous sample of the<br>
current signal, and his the time between samples of the current<br>
signal. In a preferred embodiment, the time between samples, h, is<br>
equivalent to the sampling rate of the A/D converter 84.<br><br>
[0042] The two-point backward difference approximation of<br>
the derivative may be sensitive to signal noise. Approximations with a<br>
smaller degree of error can be calculated, but they generally use<br>
additional samples to achieve accuracy or use non-realtime<br>
processing. Therefore, it is preferable to calculate the derivative of a<br>
moving average of the current signal rather than the current signal<br>
directly. Although the moving average of the samples will help smooth<br>
out noise, it is still possible for slight increases and decreases in the<br>
derivative of the slope to prematurely indicate that the current signal<br>
has changed direction. Thus, it is preferable for a change in slope to<br>
persist for several consecutive samples before it is reported. If the<br>
state 2 to state 3 transition is not detected within a predetermined<br>
period, the calculate time delay module 68 reports a maximum time<br>
(e.g., 50 ms) as the time delay of the solenoid 56.<br>
[0043] Referring now to Figure 6, the calculate time delay<br>
module 68 implements the steps generally shown at 90. Control<br>
begins at step 92. The calculate time delay module 68 detects the<br>
trigger signal 76 in step 94 and determines whether the trigger signal<br>
76 has been activated in step 96. If the trigger signal 76 has not been<br>
activated control returns to step 94. However, if the trigger signal 76<br>
has been activated the calculate time delay module 68 executes step<br>
98 to calculate the moving average of the current signal. In step 100,<br>
the calculate time delay module 68 approximates the derivative of the<br>
current signal with the backward difference approximation of the<br>
moving average of the current signal. In step 102, the calculate time<br>
delay module 68 updates the time delay calculation. In step 104, the<br>
calculate time delay module determines whether the slope of the<br>
current signal has transitioned from negative to positive. If the slope<br>
has transitioned, control ends in step 106. If the slope has not<br>
transitioned, the calculate time delay module 68 determines whether<br>
the maximum time has been exceeded to find the transition of the<br><br>
slope of the current signal in step 108. If the maximum time has been<br>
exceeded, control ends in step 106. If the maximum time has not been<br>
exceeded, control returns to step 94 for another iteration.<br>
[0044] Referring now to Figure 7, the update time delay<br>
calculation in step 102 is implemented by a state machine. The state<br>
machine begins in state 0 when the vehicle 10 is started. While in<br>
state 0, control determines whether the trigger signal 76 has been<br>
activated in step 112. If the trigger signal 76 has not been activated,<br>
control remains in state 0.<br>
[0045] If the trigger signal 76 has been activated, control<br>
enters state 1 and sets a timer to zero in step 114. In step 116, control<br>
sets a debounce counter to zero. The debounce counter is used to<br>
ensure that a change in current slope persists for several consecutive<br>
samples. The timer is incremented in step 118. In step 120, control<br>
determines whether the maximum time has been exceeded to locate<br>
the transition from negative to positive of the current slope. If the<br>
maximum time has been exceeded, control enters state 3 and reports<br>
the maximum time as the time delay in step 122. If the maximum time<br>
has not been exceeded, control remains in state 1 and determines<br>
whether the current slope is negative or zero in step 126. If the current<br>
slope is not negative or zero, control resets the debounce counter to<br>
zero in step 128 and returns to step 118. If the current slope is<br>
negative or zero control determines whether the slope has been<br>
negative for the last several consecutive samples in step 130. If the<br>
slope has not been negative for the last several consecutive samples,<br>
control remains in state 1, increments the debounce counter in step<br>
132, and returns to step 118.<br><br>
[0046] If the slope has been negative for the last several<br>
consecutive samples, control enters state 2 and sets the debounce<br>
counter to zero in step 134. In step 136, control increments the timer.<br>
In step 138, control determines whether the maximum time has been<br>
exceeded to find the transition of the slope of the current signal from<br>
negative to positive. If the maximum time has been exceeded, control<br>
enters state 3 and reports the maximum time as the time delay in step<br>
122. If the maximum time has not been exceeded, control remains in<br>
state 2 and determines whether the slope of the current signal is<br>
positive or zero in step 140. If the slope is not positive or zero, control<br>
resets the debounce counter in step 142 and returns to step 136. If the<br>
slope is positive or zero, control determines whether the slope has<br>
been positive for the past several samples in step 144. If the slope of<br>
the current signal has not been positive for the last several consecutive<br>
samples, control remains is state 2, increments the debounce counter<br>
in step 146, and returns to step 136. If the slope has been positive for<br>
the last several consecutive samples, control enters state 3 and reports<br>
the time delay in step 122.<br>
[0047] Referring now to Figure 8, the diagnostic module 70<br>
implements the steps generally shown at 148. The process only shows<br>
control for two solenoids 56, but the process can be implemented for<br>
any number of solenoids 56. Control begins in step 150. The<br>
diagnostic module 70 reads a voltage from the voltage measurement<br>
module 72 in step 152 and determines whether time delay data is<br>
available for all solenoids 56 in step 154. If time delay data is not<br>
available, control returns to step 152. If time delay data is available,<br>
step 156 determines whether time delay of the first solenoid is within<br>
an upper and lower time threshold. If the time delay is not within the<br>
upper and lower time threshold, control indicates a fault for the first<br>
solenoid in step 158. If the time delay is within the upper and lower<br>
time threshold, control indicates a pass for the first solenoid in step<br><br>
160. In step 162, control determines whether the time delay of a<br>
second solenoid is within the upper and lower time threshold. If the<br>
time delay is not within the upper and lower time threshold, control<br>
indicates a fault for the second solenoid in step 164 and control ends in<br>
step 166. If the time delay is within the upper and lower threshold,<br>
control indicates a pass for the second solenoid in step 168 and control<br>
ends in step 166.<br>
[0048] Referring now to Figure 9, the graph 170 shows<br>
exemplary upper and lower thresholds with respect to voltage supplied<br>
to the solenoid 56. The diagnostic module 70 uses the time delay<br>
calculated from the calculate time delay module 68 and the voltage<br>
output of the voltage reading module 72 to determine if the solenoid 56<br>
has a fault. More specifically, the time delay of the solenoid 56 must<br>
be greater than the upper threshold 172 or less than the lower<br>
threshold 174 for the respective voltage supplied to the solenoid 56 to<br>
register a fault.<br>
