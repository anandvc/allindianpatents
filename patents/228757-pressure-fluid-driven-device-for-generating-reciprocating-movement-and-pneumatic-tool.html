				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a pressure-fluid driven device for<br>
generating a reciprocating movement. It also concerns a valve<br>
arrangement therefore and a pneumatic tool including such a<br>
device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Such a device is known from US-A-50 82 067. One embodiment in<br>
that document includes a working chamber between two<br>
relatively movable parts, each with a channel or conduit for<br>
supply or discharge of piessure-fluid drive medium,<br>
appropriately compressed air. An axial movement of a tubular<br>
upright displaces the valve element from its seat, thereby<br>
opening a fluid path to supply drive medium into the working<br>
chamber.<br>
Pressurising the working chamber displaces the movable parts<br>
in mutually opposite directions, and when the movable parts<br>
have been sufficiently separated, the supply channel closes<br>
and the discharge channel, in the upright opens for discharge<br>
of the drive medium allowing the relatively movable parts to<br>
approach each other so a.5 to repeat the procedure described<br>
above. A reciprocating movement is obtained by using a system<br>
of springs or other means to return the parts towards each<br>
other after depressurisation.<br>
Using the described embodiment would be very useful in an<br>
arrangement where the two movable parts are mutually discrete<br>
and disposed one after the other in the same housing. This<br>
arrangement would be very attractive as the tool diameter can<br><br>
be made smaller and it therefore should provide for tools,<br>
which are easier to handle, have less demands on tolerances,<br>
have lower manufacturing cost, have less number of bearing<br>
surfaces and thus lower vi.bration level. However, a device<br>
built in the described manner has an effective output, which<br>
is too low to be of any practical, use.<br>
AIM AND MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an aim of this inveition to provide a solution to the<br>
problems of the prior art and to suggest a solution making it<br>
possible to achieve better effective output while maintaining<br>
the advantages of the prior art.<br>
It is a further aim to provide a solution allowing dimensional<br>
advantages and simple and economic manufacture because of the<br>
possibility of obtaining a device having reduced dimensions<br>
with maintained performance, compared to prior art. It is<br>
still a further aim to make these improvements useful for<br>
devices working as pneumatic tools including systems for<br>
vibration reduction.<br>
These aims are achieved according to the invention.<br>
By providing control means connected to at least one of the<br>
valve elements so that the valve elements of the valve<br>
arrangement are axially separated, thus positioning the fluid<br>
inlet to the working chanter separated from the fluid<br>
discharge, several advantages are achieved. The positions and<br>
dimensions of the inlet end discharge are independent of each<br>
other. Thus, each one can be independently optimized to suit<br>
the function and flow characteristics desirable for the<br>
specific application for which the device is to be applied.<br><br>
By the valve elements being movable relative to the parts,<br>
several advantages are obtained such as self-adjustment of the<br>
valve arrangement. This in turn makes the arrangement<br>
relatively insensitive to tolerances, which allows economic<br>
manufacture .<br>
According to a particularly preferred aspect, the valve<br>
elements are connected to each other by the control means,<br>
(e.g. a stem) so as to form a valve body. This provides for<br>
excellent self-adjustment properties.<br>
By allowing the valve elements to perform a limited movement<br>
relative to each other during operation, the operating cycle<br>
may be further optimized. This possibility provides for<br>
advantageous control of the operating cycle and thus enhanced<br>
performance. For example, the period when pressure-fluid is<br>
active inside the working chamber prior to discharge can be<br>
prolonged.<br>
This function may be obtained by the connection between the<br>
valve elements being elastically flexible. The operating cycle<br>
can also be advantageous]y altered by at least one of the<br>
valve elements being flexible. A corresponding functional<br>
advantage is achieved by instead having at least one of the<br>
valve seats being elastically flexible.<br>
The fluid pressure may also act on one or both of the valve<br>
elements to ensure that the element or elements is or are in<br>
the intended position or positions to perform the desired<br>
function.<br>
Placing the two movable parts in a common housing in such a<br>
way that they are mutually discrete and disposed one after the<br><br>
ether and each part is sealing against the housing, makes it<br>
possible not only to build devices with smaller diameters, but<br>
also with smaller sealing surfaces and a lesser number of<br>
bearing surfaces. This tends to lower manufacturing costs and<br>
influence several other important variables positively and<br>
produce more power and lewer noise and vibration level.<br>
Further advantages are achieved through the features of the<br>
other dependent claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be. described in more detail with<br>
reference to the annexed drawings, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 shows, in an axian section, a device according to the<br>
invention in a first.position,<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show, in akial sections and in enlarged scale,<br>
the valve arrangement in different positions,<br>
Fig. 4 shows, in an axial section, a second embodiment of the<br>
invention, and<br>
Fig. 5 shows, in an axial section, a third embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERREC EMBODIMENTS<br>
In this description like elements in different embodiments may<br>
carry the same reference signs.<br>
In Fig. I reference sigr. 1 refers to a pressure - fluid driven<br>
device for generating a reciprocating movement. The device<br>
includes a housing 2, which encloses a first movable part 5<br><br>
having a first channel or a fluid passage 6. Also a second<br>
movable part .3 is enclosed inside the housing 2. The part 3 is<br>
designed with an integral part 4 (in this case a stylus, but<br>
other designs with files, knives, saws, chisels etc. may also<br>
be used or it can be a piston hitting on a chisel, anvil,<br>
needles or similar) for performing some operation on a work<br>
piece (not shown). The movable parts delimit a working chamber<br>
7 together with the housing 2.<br>
The device may be adapted for generating a reciprocating<br>
movement, which can be used also for other applications<br>
involving driving members irtended for reciprocation.<br>
Pressure-fluid from a pressure-fluid source (not shown) is let<br>
into the housing 2 over an inlet 14 and passes through the<br>
fluid passage 6 into the working chamber 7 and is discharged<br>
from this working chamber 7 over a second channel or a<br>
discharge passage 15 to an cutlet. The outlet is in the case<br>
of the shown embodiment arranged as channels through the wall<br>
of the housing 2.<br>
The pressure-fluid flow through the device 1 is controlled by<br>
a valve arrangement, which includes a valve body 8 having a<br>
first valve element 10, which co-operates with the first<br>
movable part 5 and a second valve element 9, which co-operates<br>
with the second movable part 3.<br>
This is shown in greater detail in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig.2 shows<br>
the position of the valve body 8 when the two movable parts<br>
are far away from each other and the discharge passage 15 is<br>
open. Fig. 2 shows in particular the first valve element 10<br>
co-operating with a surface which is positioned on an upstream<br>
side of the first part 5, and comprising a first valve seat<br><br>
13. The second valve elemer.t 9 co-operates with a second valve<br>
seat 12, which is provided on the second part 3 (Fig. 3).<br>
This means that pressure ir. fluid coming from the pressure-<br>
fluid inlet 14 in Fig. l urges the first valve element 10<br>
against the first valve seat 13 in the position as seen in<br>
Fig. 2. Similarly, the second valve element 9 is pressed,<br>
through fluid pressure, which is being present inside the<br>
working chamber 7, in a direction against the second valve<br>
seat 12, so as to close the passage from the working chamber<br>
into the discharge passage 15 as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 also show that the valve body 8 includes a<br>
control means, in this case a stem 11 for connecting the first<br>
and second valve elements 9 and 10, respectively. The valve<br>
elements are thus axially separated a chosen distance from<br>
each other. The stem 11 is accordingly dimensioned so as to<br>
allow a chosen distance between the parts 3 and 5 in order to<br>
provide for separation of the inlet and outlet areas.<br>
According to the invention :his feature provides advantageous<br>
flow characteristics with respect to flow of fluid into as<br>
well as out from the working chamber without the respective<br>
flow being disturbed or restricted by elements belonging to<br>
the other one of the respect ive one of the inlet or outlet<br>
functions. The stem is rigic. in the embodiment shown but may<br>
also be flexible, which will be discussed later. The<br>
construction with the valve elements and the control mear.s<br>
being an integral unit, which is free, in such a way that both<br>
valve elemer.cs are movable with respect to the pares, is<br>
advantageous in that it allows self-adjustment and makes the<br>
device relatively insensitive to tolerances.<br><br>
Further, in Fig. 1 it is shown Chat the first part 5 is<br>
associated with a first force accumulator, in this case a<br>
spring 18. This spring 18 is put under increased load as the<br>
first mcvaole part is moving in a first direction, i.e.<br>
forward or to the right in Fig. 1.<br>
As the pressure-fluid drive medium enters the working chamber<br>
7 through the inlec channel 6 passed the valve element 10, the<br>
cwo parts 5, 3 are driven n opposite directions, the first<br>
part 5 to the left in Fig. L, under simultaneous decrease of<br>
the load on its associated spring, and the second part 3 to<br>
the right under simultaneous increase of the load on its<br>
associated force accumulator, in this case a spring 17. The<br>
cotal of the reaction forces which are applied by the two<br>
springs directly or indirec:ly to the housing 2 will therefore<br>
remain substantially constant through the entire movement<br>
cycle, which lowers vibrations of t.he housing. Naturally other<br>
force accumulators than springs may be used, e.g. draft<br>
springs, bellows, gas springs, rubber hoses etc.<br>
Ir. the embodiment of fig 4, the valve elements are separated<br>
elements and the second valve element 9 is provided with a<br>
control means 20 in the forn of a stem which is guided in the<br>
first part so as to allow a restricted movement relative<br>
thereto. For that purpose, opposite to the second valve<br>
element it is provided with an enlargement 21 which co-<br>
operates with holding elemerts in the first part 5 so as to<br>
prevent trie control means from falling out from the first part.<br>
S. The control means 20 is arranged to urge a first valve<br>
parmanent 23 into an open position when the working chamber 7<br>
cor.: ract s, i.e. the parts approach each other, and to urge the<br>
second valve element 9 into an open position when the working<br>
chamber 7 expands, i.e. the parts move away from each otner.<br><br>
It should be noted that the construction described with<br>
respect of fig 4 may be inverted in the sense that the first<br>
valve element could be attached to the control means which in<br>
that case would be guided in the second part. The valve<br>
elements would then be affected similar to the above case.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 5 an arrangement is shown which in<br>
principle operates in the same manner as the arrangements<br>
shown in figs 1-3. Howeven, a valve body 8' having valve<br>
elements 9' and 10' is proveded with a conduit 24 which<br>
functions so as to provide pressure fluid communication<br>
between volumes (not shown) on either side of the parts 3 and<br>
5. This is advantageous e.g if high pressure fluid is used<br>
for clean blowing purposes, for keeping a tool (e.g. a chisel)<br>
in a specific position, to :reduce the force needed to open the<br>
valve for incoming fluid etc. In the shown embodiment, the<br>
valve body 8' has an .extension 25 with an enlargement 26 at<br>
its free end matching inside the channel 27, and serving for<br>
guiding and sealing purposes. Outgoing fluid is discharged<br>
through a discharge channel 28, which opens downstream the<br>
valve seat for the valve element 9". The extension 24 and the<br>
enlargement 26 are however optional with respect to the<br>
principle of pressure fluid communication through the conduit<br>
8' .<br>
The invention may be modified within the scope of the annexed<br>
claims. The invention may also be applicable in virtually any<br>
equipment using reciprocating movement besides tools.<br>
The operating cycle can be modified by generally arranging for-<br>
al lowing the valve elements to perform a relative movement<br>
between each other, e.g. by making the stem 11 flexible. The<br>
operating cycle can also be modified by using valve elements,<br><br>
which provide flexible co-operation with the movable parts. A<br>
further way of modifying the operating cycle is to use valve<br>
reception means, such as seats, being flexible for offering<br>
flexible co-operation with the valve elements.<br>
The valve arrangement can be made in many different ways<br>
including being comprised of sliding valve elements being<br>
positioned in the respective parts.<br>
Either one of the movable parts may be used as an active<br>
working part, but both parts can also be used for performing<br>
the useful work. They can e.g. impact on different parts of an<br>
anvil.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 1 may be amended such that one of the<br>
parts is fixedly attached to a support structure. Thus, in<br>
this case only the other ore of the parts is free to move. The<br>
housing may be separate frcm, integral with or fixed to any of<br>
the respective parts.<br>
Instead of using compression springs to return the movable<br>
parts towards each other there are many other possibilities<br>
including using pressure-fluid from the pressure-fluid source.<br><br>
