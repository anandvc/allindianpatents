				<td>A BILIQUID FOAMS<br><br>
The present invention relates to biliquid foams with a<br>
high alcohol content and to products which are formulated<br>
therefrom.<br>
Biliquid foams are known in the art in which small<br>
droplets of a non-polar liquid such as an oil are<br>
encapsulated in a surfactant-stabilized film of a<br>
hydrocarbon bonded liquid, such as water, and separated from<br>
one another by a thin film of the hydrogen bonded liquid.<br>
The water or other hydrogen bonded liquid thus forms the<br>
continuous phase in biliquid foam compositions.<br>
US-A-4486333 to Sebba discloses a method for the<br>
preparation of biliquid foam compositions which may comprise<br>
the non-polar liquid in a total amount of about 60% to about<br>
98% by volume, the hydrogen bonded liquid constituting the<br>
balance. The polar liquid may comprise a petroleum<br>
derivative, paraffin or a liquid halogenated hydrocarbon.<br>
The biliquid foam composition prepared comprising 96% by<br>
volume methanol and 4% by volume water had a limited<br>
stability of only several days.<br>
Biliquid foams are disclosed in the following<br>
literature references by Sebba:<br>
"Biliquid Foams", J. Colloid and Interface Science, 40<br>
(1972) 468-474; and "The Behaviour of Minute Oil Droplets<br>
Encapsulated in a Water Film", Colloid Polymer Sciences, 257<br>
(1979) 392-396.<br>
WO 97/32559 discloses a stable dispersion comprising an<br>
oil-based biliquid foam and an aqueous gel which is suitable<br>
for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other industries.<br>
This patent specification does not describe the use of high<br>
levels of alcohols in the compositions.<br>
US Patent No. 4999198 disclosed a biliquid foam (or<br>
polyaphron) having a continuous aqueous phase and a disperse<br>
phase in which a drug is carried in the disperse phase.<br>
This patent does not disclose the use of alcohol in the<br>
aqueous phase.<br>
There is a need to generate aqueous products with high<br>
levels of alcohol, in particular in the cosmetic and<br>
personal care markets. This need is not, however, addressed<br>
by conventional emulsion science because of the instability<br>
of emulsions containing high levels of alcohol in the<br>
aqueous phase. There is also a need to generate topical<br>
oil-based products with a high level of alcohol, which<br>
increases skin permeability, but which products do not<br>
suffer from the disadvantage of the resulting skin dryness.<br>
We have now found that high levels of alcohol can be<br>
incorporated into biliquid foams by formulating the<br>
compositions using particular selected surfactants. We have<br>
also found that these biliquid foams can be formulated with<br>
structuring agents, such as aqueous gels, to give<br>
compositions with a desired rheology.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a biliquid<br>
foam comprising or consisting of from 10% to 98% by weight<br>
of a non-polar liquid other than a fuel and from 2 to 88%,<br>
preferably 2 to 87%, by weight of a continuous phase polar<br>
liquid comprising a C1 - C4 alcohol, a liquid polyethylene<br>
glycol, ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, or mixtures<br>
thereof, in an amount of at least 65% by weight relative to<br>
the weight of the continuous phase, wherein the biliquid<br>
foam is stabilized with an amount of from 0.05% to 2% by<br>
weight, preferably 0.5% to 2% by weight, based on the total<br>
formulation of a surfactant which is selected from castor<br>
oil/poly (alkylene glycol) adducts containing from 20 to 50<br>
alkoxy groups, a C8-C24 fatty acid or hydrogenated castor<br>
oil/poly (alkylene glycol) adducts containing from 20 to 60<br>
alkoxy groups, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The polar liquid is preferably aqueous and comprises<br>
from 65% to 99% by weight of the C1-C4 alcohol, liquid<br>
polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, or<br>
mixtures thereof. The preferred C1-C4 alcohol for use in<br>
the invention is ethanol.<br>
The liquid polyethylene glycol is a polyethylene glycol<br>
which is liquid at room temperature (22Â°C). It may, for<br>
example, contain from 1 to 12 ethylene oxide units or may,<br>
for example, have a molecular weight of up to 600.<br>
The particular classes of surfactant used in the<br>
present invention have been selected for use because of<br>
their ability to assist in the preparation of the biliquid<br>
foam compositions and because they impart good stability<br>
upon the majority of the biliquid foam compositions of the<br>
present invention prepared using them. The castor<br>
oil/poly(alkylene glycol) adducts generally impart a<br>
stability of up to 45 days, whilst the hydrogenated castor<br>
oil/poly(alkylene glycol) adducts generally impart a good<br>
long term stability of from 30 to 90 days.<br>
The preferred classes of surfactants for use in the<br>
present invention are hydrogenated castor oil/polyethylene<br>
glycol adducts containing from 25 to 60 ethoxy groups, more<br>
preferably 40 to 60 ethoxy groups or castor oil/polyethylene<br>
glycol adducts containing from 25 to 45 ethoxy groups.<br>
The C8-C24 fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated.<br>
Preferred are C12-C13 fatty acids, especially oleic acid,<br>
linoleic acid and linolenic acid.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
the choice of surfactant will also depend upon the<br>
particular non-polar liquid and the particular polar liquid<br>
and the amount thereof which are used in the preparation of<br>
the biliquid foams.<br>
The surfactant which is used in the present invention<br>
may be used in combination with an appropriate co-<br>
surfactant. Examples of co-surfactants which may be used<br>
are polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers and hydrogenated castor<br>
oil/polyethylene glycol (25) adduct.<br>
The preferred amount of surfactant for use in the<br>
present invention is about 1% by weight based on the total<br>
formulation.<br>
The biliquid foam compositionsof the present invention<br>
may also contain other additives such as preservatives (for<br>
instance to prevent microbiological spoilage). These<br>
additives may be included in the non-polar liquid or the<br>
continuous phase.<br>
It will be understood that the inclusion of these<br>
additives will be at the levels and with the type of<br>
materials which are found to be effective and useful. Care<br>
needs to be taken in the choice and amount of these<br>
additives to prevent compromise to the other performance<br>
advantages of the present invention.<br>
Methods of producing biliquid foams are described in<br>
US-A-4486333 involving the preliminary formation of a gas<br>
foam in order to provide a sufficiently large surface area<br>
on which the biliquid foam can subsequently be formed. It<br>
has been found that the prior formation of a gas foam is not<br>
required to manufacture a stable biliquid foam, provided<br>
that a suitable stirring mechanism is provided in the<br>
manufacturing vessel. An important aspect of the present<br>
invention is the ability to manufacture biliquid foams<br>
without the preliminary formation of gas foam, by the use of<br>
a tank incorporating a suitable stirring mechanism.<br>
Such an apparatus comprises a tank provided with a<br>
stirrer in which the stirrer blade breaks the interface<br>
between the liquid and air. A delivery device is provided<br>
through which the oil phase (non-polar liquid), which will<br>
comprise the internal phase of the dispersion is delivered<br>
to the tank. The design of the delivery device is such that<br>
the rate of addition of the internal phase fluid can be<br>
controlled and varied during the production process. A<br>
feature of the production process is that the internal (oil)<br>
phase is added to the stirred aqueous phase slowly at first<br>
until sufficient droplets have been formed to constitute a<br>
large, additional surface area for the more rapid formation<br>
of new droplets. At this point, the rate of addition of the<br>
oil phase may be increased.<br>
The production process consists of the following steps:<br>
1. The addition of one or more chosen surfactants to<br>
one or other or both phases (as previously<br>
determined by experiment).<br>
2. The charging of the aqueous phase into the bottom<br>
of a process vessel.<br>
3. The incorporation of the stirrer into the vessel<br>
so that it stirs the surface of the aqueous phase.<br>
4. Adjustment of the stirrer speed to a previously<br>
determined level.<br>
5. The slow addition of the internal phase whilst<br>
continuing to stir at the prescribed speed.<br>
6. The speeding up of the rate of addition of the oil<br>
phase once a prescribed amount (usually between 5%<br>
and 10% of the total amount to be added) has been<br>
added.<br>
The stirring rate and the rate of addition of the oil<br>
phase are variables, the values of which depend upon the<br>
detailed design of the manufacturing plant (in particular,<br>
the ratio of tank diameter to impeller diameter), the<br>
physico-chemical properties of the oil phase and the nature<br>
and concentrations of the chosen surfactants. These can all<br>
be pre-determined by laboratory or pilot plant experiment.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
other manufacturing methods may be used, as appropriate.<br>
The high alcohol biliquid foams of the present<br>
invention may be stabilized by means of an aqueous gel and,<br>
accordingly, the present invention includes within its scope<br>
a stable dispersion having a content of C1-C4 alcohol, a<br>
liquid polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol or propylene<br>
glycol, or mixtures thereof, of at least 65% by weight,<br>
which dispersion comprises from 1 to 80% by weight of a<br>
biliquid foam and from 20 to 99% by weight of an aqueous<br>
gel.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing<br>
a stable dispersion which comprises from 1 to 50% by weight<br>
of a biliquid foam as defined above and from 99% to 20% by<br>
weight of an aqueous gel, which process comprises mixing<br>
together the biliquid foam and the aqueous gel. Preferably<br>
the dispersion has a content of C1-C4 alcohol, liquid<br>
polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, or<br>
mixtures thereof of at least 65% by weight.<br>
The aqueous gel will preferably be formed from a<br>
colloidal polymer or gum suspended in water, at a<br>
concentration of from 0.05 to 20% by weight, more preferably<br>
from 0.2 to 1% by weight. Suitable polymers or gums are,<br>
for example, alginate gums or their salts, guar gum, locust<br>
bean gum, xanthan gum, gum acacia, gelatin,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose or its hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or its salts,<br>
bentonites, magnesium aluminium silicates, "Carbomers"<br>
(salts of cross-linked polymers of acrylic acid), or<br>
glyceryl polymethacrylates or their dispersions in glycols,<br>
or any appropriate mixture of any of these polymers and<br>
gums. Preferred gelling agents are those which confer<br>
plastic behaviour on the aqueous phase, that is, under their<br>
influence, any shear stress applied to the product must<br>
attain a minimum yield value before any liquid flow takes<br>
place.<br>
The stable dispersions of the present invention may be<br>
used to formulate pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions,<br>
for example, pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions for<br>
topical application. Examples of active ingredients which<br>
may be included in such compositions are acyclovir,<br>
beclometasone, benzoyl peroxide, benzydamine, betamethasone<br>
valerate, caffeine, calamine, cetrimide, chlortetracycline,<br>
clobetasol, clobetasone, clotrimazole, crotamiton,<br>
diclofenac, diethylamine salicylate, diflucortolone,<br>
dithranol, econazole, erythromycin, fluocinolone,<br>
fluocinonide, flucortolone, fluorouracil, fluticasone,<br>
fusidic acid, felbinac, ketoprofen, gentamicin,<br>
hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone acetate, ibuprofen,<br>
isotretinoin, lactic acid, lidocaine/lignocaine, lidocaine<br>
and chlorhexidine/lignocaine and chlorhexidine, macrogol,<br>
methyl salicylate, metronidazole, mexenone, miconazole,<br>
nystatin, piroxicam, potassium hydroxy-quinoline sulphate<br>
and benzoyl peroxide, retinoic acid and its derivatives,<br>
salicylic acid, sodium fusidate, coal tar and salicylic<br>
acid, coal tar and zinc, tetracyclin, titanium, tretinoin,<br>
triamcinolone, tioconazole, triamcinolone, triclosan, urea,<br>
zinc, zinc and ichthammol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The drug concentration will vary, depending upon the<br>
drug used, from about 0.01% to 10% by weight. Hence, the<br>
compositions of the present invention comprise a safe and<br>
effective amount of the active ingredient.<br>
The stable dispersions of the present invention may<br>
therefore be used to formulate the following compositions<br>
for use in the pharmaceutical or cosmetics industry.<br>
Topical Compositions<br>
The alcohol which is preferably contained in the<br>
biliquid foams used in the present invention enhances the<br>
permeation through the skin of the active ingredient(a).<br>
The biliquid foam delivers oils to the skin and this helps<br>
to overcome skin dryness associated with topical<br>
compositions containing alcohol and to restore the barrier<br>
properties of the skin.<br>
Topical applications may comprise the delivery of<br>
drugs, such as NSAIDS or anti-acne compositions, in a cream<br>
or gel preparation, or the delivery of drugs such as<br>
nicotine, estradiol, nitroglycerin, testosterone,<br>
scopolamine, etc., via transdermal drug delivery devices or<br>
in a cream or gel preparation. Another topical application<br>
comprises the delivery of cosmeceutical products, such as<br>
anti-cellulite creams formulated with an active ingredient,<br>
such as caffeine, to the skin. The active ingredient will<br>
have an enhanced performance due to the skin enhancer effect<br>
of the alcohol.<br>
Hand Disinfectants<br>
Hand disinfectants formulated using the stable<br>
suspensions of the present invention have bactericidal<br>
properties provided by the high levels of alcohol contained<br>
in the compositions. The combination in the same product of<br>
the alcohol and oils avoids the skin dryness which is a<br>
disadvantage of existing high alcohol disinfectant<br>
compositions.<br>
The present invention will be further described with<br>
reference to the following Examples:<br>
Biliquid Foam Preparation<br>
A suitable vessel is charged with the aqueous phase of<br>
the biliquid foam. The oil phase was added at a constant<br>
rate with stirring, using a sweep stirrer or an orbital<br>
mixer. After completion of the oil addition, the stirring<br>
was continued until the size of the oil droplets became<br>
stable or reached a desired size.<br>
Stable Dispersion Preparation<br>
In a separate vessel the aqueous gel phase components<br>
were combined to produce an aqueous gel. The biliquid foam<br>
was combined with the aqueous gel under low shear stirring<br>
until a homogenous product was produced.<br>

EXAMPLES 22 TO 26<br>
Gelled Formulations<br>
Example 22 to 26 show that there is a wide range of<br>
polymers, which can be used to gel the biliquid foams.<br>
These polymer systems can be prepared at different<br>
concentrations of ethanol. Hence, the concentration of<br>
ethanol in the final formulations can also vary. All<br>
polymers were dispersed in a water/ethanol mixture using a<br>
high-shear rotorstator mixer (Silverson) and neutralizers<br>
were added as appropriate, to form polymer gels.. The<br>
biliquid foams were prepared as discussed above. All<br>
ingredients were mixed together at room temperature.<br>

Examples 27 and 28 were prepared from biliquid foam shown<br>
below. The actives were in both cases formulated in the gel<br>
phase. The Carbomer was dispersed in the water/ethanol<br>
mixture using a high-shear rotorstator mixer (Silverson).<br>
The drug was then added to the above mixture once the<br>
Carbomer was fully dispersed and an aqueous solution of 20%<br>
triethylamine (TEA) was added until a clear viscous gel at<br>
pH 7 was obtained. The biliquid foam (Example 4) was mixed<br>
with the polymer gel at room temperature until a semi<br>
viscous white gel was obtained.<br>
