				<td> ADJUSTABLE DAMPER WITH VALVE MOUNTED IN-LINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]        The present invention relates generally to an adjustable damper. and more particularity, to an adjustable damper with a valve mounted in-line,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Conventionally, adjustable dampers are used on shock absorbers to adjust the damping resistance dependent upon specific external conditions. Conventional shock absorbers operate by metering the How of fluid between chambers, Typically, shock absorbers have a central chamber with a valve siideably positioned therein. The valve is attached to the sprung mass while the cylinder, itself, is attached to the un-sprung mass; (such as the vehicle wheels). Movement of the un-sprung mass moves the valve which causes fluid to move from one side of the cylinder to the other. In addition, a reserve chamber is provided for additional fluid flow. In the adjustable darnpet, an adjustable valve is positioned between the central tube and the reserve tube. As the adiustable valve is relatively complex in construction, especially when compared to fixed resistance valves, they require a large amount of roorn for mounting. Moreover, a prime location for these valves tends to be half way along the length of the damper, as they usually regulate the flow through a down tube and into the reserve tube. As such, the conventional adjustable valve typically extends radially from the central axis of the tube and regulates fluid flow between the central chamber and the reserve tube. [0003] While this arrangement does act to provide an adjustable damper, drawbacks exist; Specifically, as the adjustable damper valve extends; radially outward from the shock absorber, it can interfere with the surrounding<br>
	.	<br>
structure of the vehicle Moreover, this radial extension creates additional manufacturing requirements, costs and difficulties. The present invention was developed in light of these and other drawbacks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] To address these and other drawbacks, the present invention provides an adjustable valve located in line with or covered by the outer tube. Accordingly, the present invention provides an inner cylinder positioned inside an outer cylinder to define a reserve chamber. A rod is positioned within the inner cylinder and has a valve attached thereto. The area above trie valve is<br><br>
defined as an upper working chamber while the area below the valve is defined as a lower working chamber. An adjustable valve porbon is supporter: in a lower support which is in turn supported by the inside wall of the outer cylinder. The adjustable valve portion regulates fluid flow from the upper working chamber tb the reserve chamber. Also, by virlue of supporting the adjustable valve portion by the inside walls of the outer cylinder, the adjustable valve portion can be positioned in-line and as one unit with the entire damper<br>
In another aspect, the inner cylinder comprises a first inner cylinder and a second inner cylinder spaced apart by a gap The gap feeds fluid from the upper working chamber of the inner cylinder into the adjustable valve for regulation into the reserve chamber.<br>
[0005] Further areas of applicability of the present inversion will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter it should he<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit trie scope of the<br>
invention.	<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0014]        The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention,  its application, or uses.<br>
[0015] Referring now to Fig. 1, a first embodiment of the present invention is shown and described. In Fig. 1, a damper  includes a fluid movement portion 12 and an adjustable valve 14.<br>
[0016] Fluid movement portion 12 includes an inner cylinder 16 and an outer cylinder 18 Preferably, inner cylinder 16 and outer cylinder 18 are coaxially aligned, such that the central axis of the inner cylinder 16 is the same as the the that of outer cylinder 18. An upper rod guide 20 and ,1 lower support 22 maintain inner cylinder 16 and outer cylinder 18 in position. Upper rod guide 20 sldingly supports a rod 24 such that rod 2A can slide up and down within inner cylinder 16. At one end of rod 24 is a valve 26. Valve 26 allows fluid to pass through at a resistance desired to properly clamp vibrations. An upper working chamber 28 is defined by an area between valve 26, innef cylinder 16, and upper rod guide 20. Likewise a lower working chamber 30 is defined by inside inner cylinder 16 or: a side of valve 26 opposite to upper rod guide 20. A down tube 32 connects upper working chamber 28 with A reserve chamber 34<br>
[0017] Reserve chamber 34 is defined by the space between outer cylinder 18 and inner cylinder 16. Reserve chamber 34 serves to compensate for the difference in volume between upper working chamber 28 and lower working chamber 30 by virtue of rod 24. Down tube 32 is a cylindrical tube that extends tram a passage 36 lo a valve entrance 38. [0018] Adjstjable valve 14 includes lower support 22, an end cap 40 and an adjustable valve portion 42. Lower support 22 clamps the outer periphery of adjustable valve portion 42 lo maintain adjustable valve portion 42 in axial<br><br>
alignment with foci 24, inner cylinder 16 and outer cylinder 'h. Likewise, end cap 40 slides mtjido outer cylinder 18 and presses against lower support 22 to seal adjustable valve portion 42 therein. Preferably, adjustable valve ;-ortion 42 is maintained within outer cylinder 18. This serves to protect 'ho valve from the external environment and the possibility o; being damaged by external elements;. Moreover, adjustable valve pornon 42 is preferably cylindrical having an axis that is aligned with that of innei cylinder 16 and outer cylinder 18 This allows the overall device to be streamlined and more compact.<br>
[0019]        Valve entrance 38 communicates with a valve entrance 44 and a valve exit 46 communicates with reserve chamber 34 inrough a passage 48 As is understood, adjustable valve portion 42 regulates flow resistance from fluid traveling trom valve entrance 38, through adjustable valve portion 42 and into passage 4|.   This regulation can be responsive to driver requirements, vehicle CPU tecjuifements, or any other requested input [0020]        Reffrrjng now to Figs. 4 and 5, the operation of the present invention is shojwrj and described.  In Fig. 4, an extension stroke is illusiratec where rod 24 i| being moved outward and away trom adjustable valve 14 Here, valve 26 jjs cpesigned to allow a small amount of fluid to flow from upper working chamber $8 to lower working chamber 30 at low piston speeds. As a result,  the majority of fluid is pumped from upper working chamber 28. through passagp $6 and into down tube 32.   From here, fluid is oassed from down tube 32, through valve entrance 38 and into adjustable valve portion 42 Adjustable vaiv|5 portion 42 then regulates the flow of fluid into passage 48 and into reservfe (jihamber 34.   Likewise, in Fig. 5, a compression stroke is illustrated wher
 <br>
working chamber H8 and lower working chamber 30 irom reserve chamber 34. Moreovei, first inner cylinder 16a and second inner cylinder !6b are spaced slightlv apart to provide a gap 16c. An aperture 50 tluidly connects upper working chamber 28 with gap 16c.<br>
[0022] Adiu$ta!ble valve 14 includes adjustable valve portion 4 support 22, and ond cap 40. A seal 52 ensures that leakage does no; occur between end cap 40 and lower support 22.<br>
{0023] In iowef support 22, a plurality ot passages ate provided therein to allow fluid tlow between tho reserve chamber and the upper and sower working chambers. Specifically, passage 48 connects reserve chamber 34 and adjustable valve portion 42, valve entrance area 38 connects vaive entrance 44 and gap 16c, and a passage 54 connects lower working chamber 30 with reserve chamber 34.<br>
[0024] A series of valves ensures that fluid moves throughout the entire damper 10 in ceilain directions under certain resistances. Specifically, a valve 56 is a aMike valve that allows fluid flow only in a direction from reserve chamber 34 to lower working chamber 30. Vaivo 25 allows fluid fiow from lower wotNin chamber 30 to upper working chamber 28. Adjustable valve portion 42 rejgulates fluid flow from valve entrance area 38 to passage 48. This regulation is dependent upon feedback from a vehiclo driver, vehicle central processing unit, or other type of feedback device. By way of a non-limiting example, adjustable valve 42 can adjust the fluid resistance therethrough base0 on an external signal from an air spring. The adjustable vaive portion Ihefi adjusts the flow resistance to obtain the best fiow resistance to obtaifi the best damping characteristics tor the given pressure in the air springs A|s adjustable valves are complicated in construction, wnen compared to tixfcd resistance valves, they tend to be large. Therefore tney have traditionally been required to be positioned external to tho outer cylinder, as the area inside the damper has been typically unable to support the adjustable valve portion.<br>
[0025J Refcjrnpg now to Fig, 6 and Fig. 7, the operation of the second embodiment of thtj present invention is described. In Fig. 6, a compression stroke is lilustraiteijJ where rod 24 is shown being moved toward adjustable vaive portion 42, This compression causes fluid in lower working chamber 30<br><br>
!o travfi through valve 26 and into upper working chamber 28. Ac She volume of lowet working dhamber 30 does not inciudo rod 24. the icjd volume of fee! causes, excess !flupd to flow into upper working chamber 28. Therefore, the excess fluid is forced from upper working chamber 28, thfourjh aperture 50 and into gap 16 From here, fluid flows from gap inc. through valve entrance area 38 and into adjustable valve portion 42. Next, fluid 1 ows ;rom adjustable vaiv@ pjortion 42 into reserve chambei 34. In Fig. 7. an extension st'okH is illustrate^ where rod 24 is moved in a direction away from adjustable valve portion 43. Here valve 26 is designed to allow a small amount of fluid to flow from, uppajr working chamber 28 to lower working chamber 30 at low piston speeds. A$ a result, the majority of fluid comes from -eserve diatribe; 34, through pagjsajge 54, through valve 56 into lower workinq ohambe' 30. [0026] Referring now to. Fig, 3, damper 10 is shown used on a vehicle Here, a sprung niass (vehicle body) 62 is connected io an un-sprung mass (wheel) 64. Specifically, rod 24 attaches to vehicle body 62 and cutoi cylinder 18 attaches iawvrfeel 64, As a result, up and down movements o: whool 6<i cause rod tip rfiove with respect to outer cylinder theiehy moving fluid as described atoofe absorb vibration.></i>
