				<td>Magnesium-based alloy with improved combination of mechanical and<br>
corrosion characteristics<br>
The given invention generally relates to magnesium-based alloys and, more<br>
definitely, to composition and structure of deformable magnesium-based alloys<br>
with the improved combination of strength, deformability and corrosion<br>
resistance at a room temperature.<br>
Magnesium belongs to the group of light metals and, naturally, is attractive as a<br>
constructional material. However it has rather low mechanical characteristics<br>
connected with limited quantity of slip planes at plastic deformation in h.c.p.<br>
(hexagonal close packing) crystalline structure. Besides magnesium has low<br>
corrosion resistance in natural conditions because of strong chemical activity. A<br>
unique way of practical using of magnesium is creation of alloys on its basis.<br>
Mechanical and corrosion properties of any metals essentially depend on<br>
presence into them of other metal elements, which can generate variety<br>
intermetallic connections and the solid solutions that may work various<br>
influences upon the specified properties. Agency of alloying elements on<br>
properties of magnesium-based alloys is well investigated in binary systems,<br>
but in multi-component alloys their aggregate effects can appear complex and<br>
in advance unpredictable. Therefore the choice of alloying elements and their<br>
proportions in an alloy are the controlling factor.<br>
The main alloying elements in industrial magnesium alloys are: aluminum, zinc,<br>
lithium, yttrium, manganese, zirconium, rare-earth metals (RE) and their<br>
combinations.<br>
Mechanical properties of magnesium alloys, as well as of other metal alloys, are<br>
controlled by change: an operating combination of known mechanisms of<br>
hardening (solid solution, precipitation strengthening, deformation hardening,<br>
grain-boundary hardening, etc.) and mechanisms of plastic deformation as due<br>
to alloy building, so also/or by change an alloy condition (temper).<br><br>
Alloying elements and alloy structure also influence simultaneously its other<br>
properties, including corrosion resistance. Corrosion ratio of magnesium and<br>
magnesium alloys also strongly depends on magnesium's degree of purity. For<br>
example, in 4 % water solution of sodium chloride a corrosion ratio of<br>
magnesium with purity of 99.9 wt. % is in hundreds times more, than<br>
magnesium with purity of 99.99 % wt, see Timonova MA. Korrosia I zaschita<br>
magnievix splavov. ML Metallurgija, 1977, 152 p. in Russian.<br>
Besides, some impurities can change a possible solubility range of other<br>
impurities. So, addition of aluminum in a magnesium-based alloy increases the<br>
influence of other alloying elements on corrosion ratio of alloy [see above].<br>
Distribution of alloying elements and impurities, structure of chemical<br>
combination, which they form, affect also the big influence on corrosion ratio of<br>
magnesium alloys and their uniformity. Besides corrosion ratio of magnesium<br>
alloys depends on a condition of an alloy - deformed, aged, in full or in part<br>
annealed etc.<br>
Alloy of the invention are supposed to be used mainly in the field of<br>
temperatures 0 - 50 °C and within the practical applications demanding good<br>
deformability and improved corrosion resistance. Therefore the previous<br>
development in the field of improvement of mechanical and corrosion properties<br>
of magnesium alloys will be considered below only under the specified<br>
temperature conditions. Data on improvement of strength, creep resistance and<br>
corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys at elevated and high temperatures<br>
will be considered only partially, though authors are well familiar with them. It is<br>
so, because, though the improved strength of such alloys will be kept and at<br>
room temperatures, but their plastic characteristics in these conditions can<br>
strongly go down.<br>
Below, at the description of properties of magnesium alloys, the range of<br>
temperatures from 0 up to 50 °C, and the quantitative contents of alloying<br><br>
elements in percentage on weight will be always implied by, if will not be other<br>
special provision.<br>
Plenty of magnesium-based alloys are fabricated now, and their compositions<br>
are chosen depending on concrete applications.<br>
The most part of magnesium-based alloys can be conditionally divided into<br>
several groups, according to prevailing alloying elements. There are groups of<br>
Mg-Li, Mg-AI, Mg-Zn and Mg-RE alloys, where RE - rare-earth metals.<br>
Alloys are also subdivided into classes within the specified groups, according to<br>
additional alloying elements. For example, under specification ASTM:<br>
- Alloys of type LAE (Mg-AI-RE) are within Mg-Li group;<br>
- Alloys of type: AM (Mg-AI-Mn), AZ (Mg-AI-Zn), AE (Mg-AI-P3M) are within of<br>
Mg-AI group;<br>
- Alloys of type ZK (Mg-Zn-Zr) and alloys ZE (Mg-Zn-P3M) are within Mg-Zn<br>
group;<br>
- Most known alloys of type WE (Mg-Y-Nd-Zr) are within Mg-RE group.<br>
Alloys of more complex composition, which cannot be carried unequivocally to a<br>
concrete class under specification ASTM, are described in various patents. The<br>
purpose of their creation is improvement of the certain characteristics of alloys.<br>
Mg-Li eutectic alloys are the most plastic alloys of magnesium (for example,<br>
Pat. No. DE 3922593,1991-01-24). According to binary phase diagram Mg-Li<br>
(Freeth W. E., Raynor, G. V., J. Inst. Metals 82, 575-80, 1954), there is an HCP<br>
alpha-phase in an alloy at the lithium contents up to 5, 7 %, which is peculiar to<br>
pure magnesium. At lithium contents more than 10 %, the beta-phase, having<br>
b.c.c. (body-centered cubic) structure, prevails in am alloy. The possible quantity<br><br>
of sliding systems and, thus, formability of alloys increases in this case. In<br>
tensile test at a room temperature elongation of alloy Mg-11 Li reaches 39 %<br>
and UTS -104 MPa (in U.S. Pat. No. 6,838,049).<br>
Lack of magnesium-lithium alloys is low strength and reduction in corrosion<br>
resistance of an alloy due to presence of chemically active lithium.<br>
Mg-Li alloys are alloyed in addition for increase of strength and corrosion<br>
stability. Aluminum and zinc are often added in Mg-Li alloys for increase of<br>
strength and corrosion resistance of them. The addition of 4 -10 % of aluminum<br>
and up to 2 % zinc leads to an quite good combination of strength and<br>
formability of Mg-Li-AI-Zn alloys.<br>
In Master's Thesis Hsin-Man Lin "Effects of Aluminum Addition on Properties of<br>
Magnesium-Lithium Alloys", Date of Defense 2004-07-15, it is shown, that<br>
addition 0.6 % Al into alloy Mg-9Li can "obviously increase the mechanical<br>
strength and corrosion resistance, and maintain the properties of elongation at<br>
temperatures below 200 °C and any speeds of deformation".<br>
However presence of aluminum, also as well as zinc, in Mg-Li alloys reduces<br>
their formability at room temperature, which is the main advantage of these<br>
alloys. Such changes are essential adverse effect of presence of the specified<br>
elements in Mg-Li alloys.<br>
There are offered also another combination of alloying elements in alloys on the<br>
base of Mg-Li.<br>
In JP Pat. No. 8-23057B yttrium addition is offered for increase in strength of<br>
Mg-Li alloy, but presence of one more active element in an alloy reduces, in<br>
addition, corrosion resistance of such alloys.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No.6,838,049 is described "a magnesium alloy formed at a room<br>
temperature with excellent resistance of corrosion". Its composition includes<br><br>
from 8.0 up to 11.0 % of lithium, from 0.1 up to 4.0 % of zinc, from 0.1 up to 4.5<br>
% of barium, from 0.1 up to 0.5 % Al, and from 0.1 up to 2.5 % Ln (a total sum<br>
of one or more lanthanides) and from 0.1 up to 1.2 % Ca with the balance,<br>
which is being Mg and inevitable impurity. Authors consider that "Ba forms an<br>
intermetallic compound (Mg.sub.17 Ba.sub.2) with Mg. Because Mg.sub.17<br>
Ba.sub.2 precipitates at a temperature of 634.degree. C. which is close to<br>
588.degree. C, which is the Mg-Li eutectic reaction temperature, but higher<br>
than this reaction temperature, it acts as a nucleus when the alpha- and beta-<br>
phases precipitate, providing for refinement and uniform dispersion of alpha-<br>
and beta-phases".<br>
However, though barium has b.c.c. lattice, but it has a low solubility in Mg and<br>
formed intermetallic, which reduce an initial plastic characteristics of Mg-Li<br>
alloys.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,390 "A dual-phase magnesium-based alloy consisting<br>
essentially of about 7-12% lithium, about 2-6% aluminum, about 0.1-2% rare<br>
earth metal, preferably scandium, up to about 2% zinc and up to about 1%<br>
manganese" is offered. The alloy exhibits improved combinations of strength,<br>
formability and/or corrosion resistance.<br>
In JP Pat. No. 9,241,778 (1997-09-16) the magnesium alloy for use as the<br>
constructional material is offered. Alloy contains up to 40 % Li and one more<br>
additive from the following: up to 10 % Al, up to 4 % Zn, up to 4 % Y, up to 4 %<br>
Ag and up to 4 % RE.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No.5,238,646 the method of preparation of the alloy having the<br>
improved combination of strength, formability and corrosion resistance is<br>
offered. The specified alloy includes: approximately 7-12 % of lithium;<br>
approximately 2-7 % of aluminum; approximately 0.4-2 % RE; approximately up<br>
to 2 % of zinc; and approximately up to 1 % of manganese, balance magnesium<br>
and impurity. Purity of magnesium taken for a basis of an alloy is 99.99 %.<br>
Authors ranked yttrium and scandium also to group of rare earth metal. Though<br><br>
they have an identical structure of external electronic shells of atoms with<br>
metals of RE group and similarity of some chemical properties, but they shell be<br>
distinguished from RE, according to Standard ASTM, in their differing<br>
characteristics for alloys.<br>
In JP Pat. No. 2000 282165 Mg-Li alloy with the improved corrosion resistance<br>
is offered. The alloy contains up to 10.5 % Li and magnesium with concentration<br>
of iron 
alloy in a crucible coated with chromium or chromium oxide".<br>
Mg-AI alloys (classes AM, AZ and AE) are the most widespread in practice<br>
group of magnesium alloys. However, though they also show the better<br>
corrosion resistance and higher strength, than Mg-Li alloys, but they are much<br>
less plastic properties.<br>
One of methods of corrosion resistance increasing of magnesium alloys is<br>
reduction of a contents level of Fe, Ni and Cu. According to L. Duffy (Materials<br>
World, vol. 4, pp. 127-30,1996), corrosion ratio of alloy AZ91E (salt fog tests) is<br>
in 100 times less, than for alloy AZ91C, owing to higher purity (0.1 % Cu, 0.01<br>
% Ni, 0.3 % max the others - in alloy A291C and 0.015 % Cu, 0.001 % Ni,<br>
0.005 % Fe, 0.3 % max the others - in alloy AZ91E).<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 2005 0,129,564 it is offered the alloy containing: of 10 to 15 %<br>
Al, 0.5 to 10 % Sn, 0.1 to 3 % Y, and 0.1 to 1 % Mn, the balance being Mg and<br>
inevitable impurities.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,224 the alloy, which includes magnesium as a main<br>
component, boron of 0.005 % or more, manganese of 0.03 to 1 %, and<br>
substantially no zirconium or titanium is offered. This magnesium alloy may<br>
further include aluminum of 1 to 30 % Al and/or zinc of 0.1 to 20 %. Because of<br>
appropriate amounts of boron and manganese contained in the magnesium<br>
alloy, the grain of the magnesium alloy is refined.<br><br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 2005 0,095,166 it is offered "Heat resistant magnesium alloy for<br>
casting", witch includes 6-12 % of aluminum, 0.05-4 % of calcium, 0.5-4 % of<br>
rare earth elements, 0.05-0.50 % of manganese, 0.1-14 % of tin, balance are<br>
magnesium and inevitable impurities. Data about plastic characteristics of an<br>
alloy at room temperatures are not resulted.<br>
Among Mg-Zn alloys are the most known: alloys of class ZK (magnesium-zinc-<br>
zirconium), having good durability and plasticity at a room temperature; alloys of<br>
class ZE (magnesium-zinc-RE), having average durability; alloys of class ZH<br>
(magnesium-zinc-thorium), having high room-temperature yield strength in aged<br>
condition (T5). The magnesium alloys, containing thorium, are not made now,<br>
because of their weak radio-activity.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 2001 6,193,817 it is offered a magnesium base alloy for high<br>
pressure die casting (HPDC), providing good creep and corrosion resistance,<br>
comprises: at least 91 % of magnesium; 0.1 to 2 % of zinc; 2.1 to 5 % of a rare<br>
earth metal component; 0 to 1 % of calcium.<br>
Alloys of type WE (Mg-Y-Nd-Zr) are the most known among alloys Mg with RE.<br>
These alloys possess quite good formability and the increased corrosion<br>
resistance. According to the specification of the manufacturer (Magnesium<br>
Elektron Ltd., Manchester, England) elongation of alloy ELEKTRON WE43<br>
CASTINGS can achieve 17 % at a room temperature, and corrosion ratio is<br>
equal 0.1-0.2 mg\cm2day (ASTM B117 salt spray test) or 0.1 mg\cm2\day (sea<br>
water immersion test). However, deformability of this alloy is insufficient in many<br>
cases, and the experimental dispersion of mechanical characteristics of WE43<br>
ingots is very great: elongation 2 - 17 % (average value is 7 %, data of the<br>
manufacturer on the base of 215 samples). Deformed (extruded, forget) and<br>
thermo-threatened alloy WE 43 shows more stable, but lower plasticity at a<br>
room temperature - up to 10 % (condition T5, T6).<br>
Various changes of Mg-RE alloys composition are offered for increase of its<br>
operating ability.<br><br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 2004-07-27 6,767,506 it is offered "High temperature resistant<br>
magnesium alloys", containing at least 92 % magnesium, 2.7 to 3.3 %<br>
neodymium. 0.0 to 2.6 % yttrium, 0.2 to 0.8 % zirconium, 0.2 to 0.8 % zinc, 0.03<br>
to 0.25 % calcium, and 0.00 to 0.001 % beryllium. The alloy may additionally<br>
contain up to 0.007 iron, up to 0.002 % nickel, up to 0.003 % copper and up to<br>
0.01 silicon and incidental impurities.<br>
Interest to WE-type alloys, as to a constructional material of vessel stents, has<br>
increased last years. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2004 098108 it is offered to<br>
make vascular endoprostheses, comprising a carrier structure, which contains a<br>
metallic material. This metallic material contains a magnesium alloy of the<br>
following composition: magnesium: &gt; 90 %, yttrium: 3.7-5.5 %, rare earths: 1.5-<br>
4.4 % and balance: 
WE43. However, because of insufficient plasticity of such alloy, authors had<br>
simultaneously to offer a new stent design, which provides its working capacity<br>
at the lowered plastic characteristics of the offered alloy.<br>
Mechanical characteristics (tensile test, room temperature) and corrosion ratio<br>
of some most widespread magnesium-based alloys, taken of various accessible<br>
sources are resulted in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Tests for corrosion behavior were carried out by the special technique: in a<br>
stream of 0.9 % water solution of sodium chloride. Speed of stream was 50<br>
m\min. Corrosion ratio was determined on loss of sample's weight and<br>
through quantity of magnesium, passed into a solution washing specimen.<br>
The data of measurements were averaged. Such testing scheme allows<br>
continuously washing off products of corrosion from sample's surface which,<br><br>
for example, deform results of corrosion ratio studying by a method of<br>
measurement of sample's weight loss.<br>
Characters in titles of alloys designate: A - aluminum, E - the rare earth<br>
(RE), K - zirconium, L - lithium, M - manganese, W - yttrium, Z - zinc, and<br>
figures - the contents of an alloying elements approximated to an integer in<br>
percentage.<br>
Table 1 shows that various magnesium alloys have different combinations of<br>
mechanical and corrosion characteristics. One has higher strength, others are<br>
less strength, but are more deformable. However, for responsible applications, it<br>
is desirable to combine high strength and high plasticity with preservation of<br>
sufficient level of corrosion resistance.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is creation of new magnesium-based alloy<br>
having improved (in comparison with existing) combination of strength and<br>
plasticity at preservation of low corrosion ratio, peculiar to alloys of WE- and AZ-<br>
types. For example, it is desirable to create an alloy having yield stress (YS)<br>
more 200 MPa, tensile strength about 300 MPa and more, elongation more than<br>
22 % and corrosion ratio about of 0.1 mg\cm2\day (sea water immersion test) at<br>
a room temperature.<br>
On the basis of available data about the influence of various alloying elements<br>
and their compounds (quantity, condition, distribution, etc.) on magnesium<br>
properties and the carried out own experiments, authors have accepted<br>
following preconditions for development of an offered alloy.<br>
1. The magnesium taken as a basis of an alloy should have high purity. The<br>
total contents of impurities should no be more than 0.005 %, without taking into<br>
account contents of Fe, Ni and Cu. The contents of these elements, affect the<br>
most adverse influence on corrosion characteristics of magnesium, should be<br>
limited no more than 0.001 % of everyone.<br><br>
2. The alloy should contain alloying elements in the quantities, which are not<br>
essentially exceeding their solubility in solid magnesium, according to known<br>
binary phase diagrams.<br>
3. Purity of alloying elements should not be worse than 99.98 % (only metal<br>
impurities are considered).<br>
4. Authors have chosen basic alloying elements, which appreciably improve one<br>
of characteristics of alloy in considered combination (strength, plasticity,<br>
corrosion resistance) and which influence minimally unfavorably on other alloy<br>
properties of invention.<br>
5. For use in medical purposes, the alloy of invention should not contain, in<br>
appreciable quantities, the elements that affect adverse influence on human's or<br>
animal's organism (Zn, Th, Sr, Cd, Al, etc).<br>
6. It is necessary to add in alloy the elements that affect modifying influence<br>
(grain-refining) on its structure and providing grain size in initial ingot no more<br>
10 microns.<br>
7. For additional (besides an alloying) improvement in combination of<br>
mechanical and corrosion characteristics of offered alloy, it is suggested to use<br>
it in ultra fine-grained condition with the average grain size no more than 3<br>
microns. The specified grain structure may be created by processing of an initial<br>
ingot or preliminary extruded slab with application of developed by authors<br>
method of programmed intensive plastic deformation in a combination with<br>
programmed heat treatment [Physitcheskoe metaltovedenie beryllium, I.<br>
Papirov, G. Tikhinsky, 1968, Atomizdat, Moscow, in Russian]. Methods of<br>
pressure processing of preform should be applied for this purpose, which will be<br>
providing prevalence of torsional or shear stresses in a handled material.<br><br>
On the basis of the aforesaid authors have chosen following alloying elements<br>
for magnesium-based alloy as the preferred embodiment(s) of the given<br>
invention.<br>
Scandium has a limit of solubility in solid magnesium about 29 %. According to<br>
laboratory findings of authors, addition of scandium into magnesium within the<br>
limits of up to 8 % provides creation of solid solution Mg-Sc that increases its<br>
plasticity and strength. In the interval of scandium concentration from 3 up to 8<br>
% corrosion ratio of Mg-Sc alloy in water solution of sodium chloride increases<br>
slightly. Precipitation of Mg-Sc phase is possible during high-temperature<br>
processing of magnesium alloys with the big contents of scandium. However,<br>
very thin intermetallic bond in the form of the plates, formed in a direction<br> in a basal plane, is distributed non-uniformly and do not make any<br>
hardening at a room temperature when the main mechanism of deformation is<br>
basic sliding [Buch F., Mordike B.: Microstructure, Mechanical Properties and<br>
Creep Resistance of Binary Magnesium Scandium Alloys. In: Magnesium 97<br>
(Eds. Aghion, E., Eliezer, D.), MRl, Beer Sheva 1998, p. 163-168].<br>
Besides scandium also is the strong modifier grain structure of magnesium<br>
ingots.<br>
Yttrium has the limit of solubility in magnesium about 2 % at room temperature.<br>
Addition up to 3 % of yttrium into magnesium increases strength of an alloy<br>
without essential reduction in its plasticity and corrosion resistance.<br>
Rare earth (RE) metals influence on properties of magnesium alloys depends<br>
on their solubility in it and their melt point. Solubility RE in solid magnesium<br>
changes from practically zero (La) up to 7 percent (Lu). Metals from group with<br>
nuclear numbers from 64 (Gd) up to 71 (Lu) have melting temperatures and<br>
limits of solubility in magnesium higher, than metals of cerium group.<br>
Introduction up to 3 % refractory RE in a magnesium alloy raises creep and<br>
corrosion resistance of an alloy, and reduces micro porosity of multi-component<br>
alloy at its melting.<br><br>
Zirconium, as is well-known, is a basic element, which crushes grain size in<br>
magnesium alloys during an ingot production. The fine-grained ingot is easier<br>
exposed to preliminary and subsequent deformation.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing objectives, as preferable embodiments,<br>
authors offer the following magnesium-based alloy having the improved<br>
combination of mechanical and corrosion characteristics at room temperature.<br>
Alloy consists essentially of: magnesium base with purity not less 99.995 %,<br>
scandium from 1 up to 10 %, preferable 2.5-6 %, yttrium from 0.1 up to 3 %,<br>
preferable 2-2.5 %, rare earth from 1 up to 3 %, zirconium from 0.1 up to 0.5 %,<br>
preferable 0.3-0.4 %. Contents Fe, Ni and Cu do not exceed 0.001 % of<br>
everyone, the total contents of incidental elements and impurities do not exceed<br>
0.005 %.<br>
Alloy of the specified composition is received by direct fusion of magnesium<br>
with preliminary prepared master alloy from the specified alloying elements in<br>
high-frequency induction furnace in atmosphere of high purity argon and in high<br>
purity graphite crucible. Melt is poured out in cooled steel mold with a special<br>
daubing by a method of bottom teem.<br>
The prepared ingot further is subjected to pressure treatment by the developed<br>
by authors method of programmed intensive plastic deformation (for example,<br>
by different-channel angular extrusion) at temperatures 250-350 °C in<br>
combination with programmed heat treatment. At achievement of micro-<br>
hardness Hμ more than 110 kg/mm2, preform is subjected to an annealing at<br>
temperature 270-320 °C.<br>
Preform prepared by the above-stated method, further is subjected to usual<br>
industrial schemes reception of sheets, rods, wire, tubes, etc. for produce final<br>
products.<br><br>
For example the alloy material is well qualified for stents. The alloy material has<br>
the capability of a desired deformation regarding to a specific application.<br>
Furthermore the grain size is adjustable for tuning the strength characteristics.<br><br>
Examples of preferred embodiments<br>
Example 1<br>
Alloy consists essentially of: magnesium with purity of 99.997 % with addition of<br>
4.2 % scandium, 2.4 % yttrium, 3.0 % the rare earth, 0.4 % zirconium. Contents<br>
Fe, Ni and Cu were not exceed 0, 001 % of everyone, the contents of incidental<br>
elements and impurities do not exceed 0,005 %.<br>
The alloy was received by direct fusion of magnesium with preliminary prepared<br>
master alloy from the specified elements in high-frequency induction furnace in<br>
an atmosphere of high purity argon and in high purity graphite crucible.<br>
For full dissolution of all components, alloy was stood in crucible at temperature<br>
720 °C within 30 minutes and then was poured out in cooled steel mold with a<br>
special daubing by a method of bottom teem.<br>
The received ingot (diameter of 50 mm) was extruded at temperature 340 °C<br>
with an extrusion ratio of 3:1.<br>
The received semi-finished product has been subjected to deformation by<br>
different-channel angular extrusion at temperature 320 °C, number of cycles of<br>
extrusion -12, with intermediate annealing at temperature 275 °C through 2-3<br>
cycles (at achievement of micro-hardness Hμ of 110 kg/mm2).<br>
Samples have been cut out from the received extrudate for tensile test at room<br>
temperature and tests for corrosion behavior (in a stream of 0.9 % water<br>
solution of sodium chloride. Speed of stream was 50 m\min).<br>
Test results:<br><br>
Mechanical properties (after annealing at temperature 320 °C within one hour):<br>
YS=240 MPa, UTS=320 MPa, elongation=25 %.<br>
Corrosion ratio (it is obtained by measurement of weight loss of specimens and<br>
quantitative definition of the magnesium, which has passed in a solution,<br>
through the fixed time intervals) - 2.1 mg/cm2/day.<br>
Results of tests show that the alloy of the invention with the specified<br>
composition has the best combination of mechanical and corrosion properties in<br>
comparison with the most widespread industrial alloys of magnesium (see<br>
Tabl.1).<br>
Example 2<br>
The ingot on the basis of magnesium with purity of 99.995 %, with addition of<br>
10.0 % scandium, 1.4 % yttrium, 2.0 % of rare earth (mainly - gadolinium) and<br>
0.5 % zirconium was received by the method specified in an example 1.<br>
Then the ingot had been subjected to deformation by alternation of cycles<br>
extrusion with extrusion ratio 2,5:1 and swage out till initial diameter (one cycle)<br>
at temperatures 300-340 °C, number of cycles - 5, with intermediate annealing<br>
at temperature 275 °C.<br>
Samples have been cut out from the received preparation for mechanical tests<br>
and tests for corrosion (in a stream of 0.9 % water solution of sodium chloride.<br>
Speed of stream was 50 rmmin).<br>
Test results:<br>
Mechanical properties (after annealing at temperature 290 °C within one hour):<br>
YS=210 MPa, UTS=290 MPa, elongation=29 %. Corrosion ratio (in stream) -<br>
2.9 mg/cm2/day.<br><br>
Results of tests show that the alloy of the invention of the specified structure<br>
has the best combination of deformability and corrosion properties at<br>
satisfactory strength in comparison with the most widespread industrial alloys of<br>
magnesium (see table 1).<br><br>
