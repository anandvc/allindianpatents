				<td>Process for the Manufacture of Alkenylated Hydroxylated'Aromatic Compounds, of Chroman Compounds and of their Acylated DeriA;atives<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the manufacture of alkenylated aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group, their ring-closure reactions to chroman derivatives, as well as the acylation of the latter and the aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group themselves. The present invention relates especially to a process for the manufacture of tocols, tocopherols and their alkanoates such as a-toco-pherol (TCP) and alkanoates (TCPA) thereof, preferably a-tocopheryl acetate (TCPAc). The processes of the present invention are characterized in that at least one step of the processes is carried out in the presence of an indium salt as the catalyst.<br>
As starting materials for the manufacture of TCP and TCPA either a mixture of 2,3,5-tri-methylhydroquinone (TMHQ) or a 2,3,6-trimethylhydroquinone-l-alkanoate and a compound selected from the group consisting of phytol (PH), isophytol (IP) and (iso)phytol derivatives, or the "open ring" compound 2-phytyl-3,5,6-trimethyl-hydroquinone (PTMHQ), a 3-phytyl-2,5,6-trimethylhydroquinone-l-alkanoate (PTMHQA) or an isomer thereof are used.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is the use of an indium salt as the catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions of aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group and ring-closure reactions of resulting "open ring" products to produce chroman-ring compounds in organic solvents. According to another aspect of the invention indium salts can be used as the catalyst in processes for the manufacture of tocyl alkanoates, to-<br>
MST, 03.12.2004<br><br>
copheryl alkanoates and alkanoates of aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group by reacting tocol, tocopherols and aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group, respectively, with an acylating agent.<br>
As is known, (all-rac)-oc-tocopherol (or as it has mostly been denoted in the prior art, "d,l-(X-tocopherol") is a mixture of four diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers of 2,5,7,8-tetra-methyl-2-(4',8l,12l-trimethyl-tridecyl)-6-chromanol (<x-tocopherol which is the biologically most active and industrially important member of vitamin e group.></x-tocopherol>
Many processes for the manufacture of "d,l-a-tocopherol" (referred to as such in the literature reviewed hereinafter) and its acetate by the reaction of TMHQ/2,3,6-trimethyl-hydroquinone-1-acetate (TMHQAc) with IP or PH in the presence of a catalyst or a catalyst system and hi a solvent or solvent system are described in the prior art.<br>
One example therefor is EP-A 0 694 541 which describes the reaction of TMHQ and IP, PH or a PH derivative in the presence of a mineral acid, a Lewis acid, an acidic ion exchange resin or a triflate, nitrate or sulfate of Sc, Y or a lanthanide element as the catalyst.<br>
Another example is EP-A 1 000 940, where bis-(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide [HN(SO2CF3)2] or a metal salt thereof of the formula M(N(S02CF3)2)n is used as the catalyst, wherein M is a metal atom such as for example boron, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, scandium, titanium, vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, yttrium, zirconium, rhodium, palladium, silver, tin, lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, europium, dysprosium, ytterbium, hamium, platinum and gold, and n is the corresponding valency (1, 2,3 or 4) of the metal atom M, and supercritical CCh or NaO is used as the solvent. A cosolvent may also be used, which is a lower aliphatic alkanol, ketone or hydrocarbon.<br>
TCP can be converted into its acetate, succinate and further known application forms by standard methods, e. g. as described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A27, 5th edition, pages 484 to 485, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, D-69451 Weinheim, 1996, In contrast to TCP which is labile against oxidative conditions, the esters (TCPA) are more stable and more convenient to handle.<br><br>
Concerning the known use of indium salts in the prior art, the following selected literature is discussed: According to US 6,180,557 Bl supported catalysts of the general formula AaMZb(c)/S are used as the catalysts for Friedel-Crafts reactions such as alkylation, aralky-lation, acylation or aroylation of aromatic compounds, wherein A is selected from the chemical elements Ga, Al, B, Zn, Fe, Sn, Ti, Th, Zr or a mixture of two or more thereof; M is selected from the chemical elements In, Tl or a mixture thereof; Z is selected from the chemical elements O, Cl, Br or I; S is a porous catalyst support or carrier; a is the A/M mole ratio in the range of about 0.001 to about 100; b is the number of atoms of Z needed to fulfill the valency requirement of the metallic elements AaM present in the supported catalyst; and c is the weight percentage loading of AaMZb deposited on said catalyst support or carrier (S) in the range of about 0.5 wt % to about 50 wt %. In example 13 e.g. Gai2.6lnCl4o.g (11.0 weight-%)/Montmorillonite K10 catalyzes the aralkylation of benzene, anisole, phenol, p-xylene, mesitylene and toluene with benzyl chloride or bromide.<br>
According to WO 03/028883 an "ionic liquid catalyst system" consisting of an ionic liquid and indium(in) halide components is the catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation reactions.<br>
European Journal of Organic Chemistry 2000,2347-2356 describes inter alia the use of indium(m) iodide as catalyst for transesterification processes.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of al-kenylated aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group and of the ring-closed products thereof such as a-tocopherol and its alkanoates in the presence of a catalyst and in a solvent wherein a catalyst is used which catalyzes the desired reaction as selectively as possible and in high yields. Furthermore, the catalyst should display its activity in small, really catalytic, amounts and should be readily separable and re-usable several tunes.<br>
According to the present invention this object is achieved by the use of indium salts as the catalysts. It has been surprisingly found that indium salts are most suitable catalysts for the condensation reaction of aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group such as TMHQ or TMHQA with compounds containing a double bond such as IP, PH or a derivative thereof and for the ring closure reaction of alkenylated phenols such as PTMHQ or PTMHQA and/or isomers thereof to produce chroman derivatives such as a-tocopherol as<br><br>
well as for the acylation of aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group, to-cols and tocopherols.<br>

From the preferred phenols, 1-naphthols and 2-naphthols cited above especially preferred are phenols with the following formula II<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
with X1, X2, X3 and X4 being independently from each other hydrogen, hydroxy or linear Ci-6-alkyi.<br>
Concerning the symbols X1. X2. X3 and X4: preferably these signify independently from each other hydrogen, hydroxy or Ci-2-alkyl, more preferably they signify independently from each other hydrogen, hydroxy or methyl.<br>
More preferred phenols are 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone, 2,3,6-trimethylhydroquinone 1-alkanoate, 2,3-dimethylhydroquinone, 2,5-dimethylhydroquinone, 2,6-dimethyl-hydroquinone, 2-methylhydroquinone and hydroquinone.

Therefore, in cases, where the activity of the catalyst, its amount or the further reaction conditions do not enable the isolation of the intermediates of the formula I the final products of the formula VTI are obtained. Thus, a further preferred aspect of the present invention is a process for the manufacture of compounds of the formula VTI<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
by reacting a phenol of the formula n<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
with a compound of the formula HI and/or IV in an organic solvent<br><br><br><br><br><br>

whereby the reaction is carried out in the presence of an indium salt as the catalyst<br>
(PROCESS 1-2).<br>
It is to be understood that PROCESS 1 encompasses PROCESS 1-1 and PROCESS 1-2.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is a process for the manufacture of compounds of the formula YE<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
by<br>

In the following this process will be named as PROCESS 2.<br>
In still another aspect the invention relates to a process for the manufacture of esters of compounds selected from the group consisting of aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group (ArOH) and compounds of formula VH<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
with X1, X2, X3 and X4 being independently from each other hydrogen, hydroxy or linear Ci-6-alkyl with the proviso that at least one of the substituents X1, X2, X3 and X4 is hydroxy, with an acylating agent characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an indium salt as the catalyst (in the following referred to as PROCESS 3).<br>
For the "aromatic compound featuring at least one hydroxy group (ArOH)" the same definition applies as given for PROCESS 1. Suitable acylating agents will be discussed further below.<br><br>
Concerning the indium salts used in the PROCESSES 1. 2 and 3 as the catalyst:<br>
The indium salt used as the catalyst in PROCESS 1,2 and/or 3 is suitably an indium(ID) salt. Preferably it is selected from the group consisting of indium(in) halides such as indium trichloride [InCUJ, indium tribromide [InBrs] or indium triiodide [Ma], indium tris(trifluoromethanesulfonate) (= indium(m) triflate) [InCSOsCFa^; ti(OTf)3], indium tris[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonamide)] [In(NTf2)33 and indium triacetate [In(OAc)j]. More preferred is In(OTf)3 or JtaCl3.<br>
The indium salts are known compounds which are commercially available. They can be used in solid form, anhydrous or hydrated (of which InCl3-4 HaO is an example), as well as in solution or in suspension. Preferably the catalyst is dissolved or suspended in the organic solvent or water; for PROCESS 1 and 2 the catalyst is most preferably dissolved in water. The concentration of such a solution is not critical. Furthermore, the catalyst tolerates acetic anhydride and other acylating agents as well as protonic solvents such as acetic acid, methanol, ethanol and water. After the termination of the reaction the catalyst can be recycled.<br>

The starting material TMHQAc may be obtained e.g. by selective hydrolysis of 2,3,5-tri-methylhydroquinone diacetate as described in EP-A1 239 045.2,3,5-Trimethylhydro-quinone diacetate can be prepared e.g. by the acid catalyzed rearrangement of ketoiso-phorone in the presence of acetic anhydride or another acetylation agent as described in EP-A 0 850 910, EP-A 0 916 642, EP-A 0 952 137 or EP-A 1 028 103.<br>
The (iso)phytyl compounds can be produced by conventional processes known to the person skilled in the art. Phytol and its derivatives represented by the formula IV with n = 3 can be used as E/Z-rnixture as •well as in pure E- or pure Z-form. Preferred is the use of phytol and its derivatives represented by the formula IV as E/Z-mixtures. The most preferred starting material selected from the (iso)phytyl compounds is IP.<br><br>
Of course any other appropriate isomeric form of the (iso)phytol derivatives can also be used. (fl^/O-phytol, (/?^^/Z)-isophytol, (iS^^RJ-isophytol or (/?5,J?»/?)-isophytol or an appropriate (iso)phytol derivative e.g. can be used to obtain (jR^)-PTMHQ/(/?,#)-PTMHQA or<br>
if TMHQ/TMHQA is used as the other component.<br>
The other (di)(methyl)hydroquinones and compounds of the formula HI and IV with n being 0, 1 or 2 can be prepared to processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
PROCESS 1. STEP a of PROCESS 2<br>
The compounds obtainable by PROCESS 1 and STEP a of PROCESS 2 are alkenylated aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group. If these products have the structure of the formula I, they can further react to compounds of formula VH by a ring-closure reaction. This is dependent on the activity of the catalyst, its amount and the further reaction conditions, i.e. the reaction can proceed to the final product (compounds of formula VII) if a large amount of catalyst, a highly active catalyst and/or a high reaction temperature is employed (PROCESS 1, steps a and b of PROCESS 2) or - on the contrary - the reaction is slow enough to enable the isolation of the intermediates of the formula I (PROCESS 1, only step a of PROCESS 2 is performed).<br>
Conveniently the reaction of the aromatic compound featuring at least one hydroxy group and a compound of the formula HI and/or IV is carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably gaseous nitrogen or argon. It can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under pressure.<br>
The reaction can be carried out batchwise or continuously, and hi general operationally in a very simple manner, for example (i) by adding the compound of the formula in or IV - as such or dissolved in the nbn-polar solvent (if the reaction is carried out in a non-polar solvent or a two-phase solvent system) such as mentioned below, preferably as such - por-tionwise or continuously to a mixture of the catalyst, the aromatic compound featuring at least one hydroxy group (ArOH) and the solvent/two-phase solvent system.<br>
It is also possible (ii) to add subsequently the catalyst, preferably as such or as aqueous solution, and the compound of the formula m or IV - as such or dissolved in the non-polar<br><br>
solvent (if the reaction is carried out in a non-polar solvent or a two-phase solvent system) such as mentioned below, preferably as such - to ArOH and the solvent/two-phase solvent system.<br>
Conveniently, the compound of the formula HI or IV is added continuously to ArOH within about 15 to about 180 minutes, preferably within about 30 to about 1 50 minutes, more preferably within about 45 to about 130 minutes, if the reaction is carried out in a single solvent, especially an aprotic non-polar solvent. If the reaction is carried out in a two-phase solvent system, the feed rate is not critical. The catalyst is preferably added at once to the mixture of ArOH and the solvent/two-phase solvent system.<br>
After completion of the addition of the compound of the formula HI or IV (in the non-polar solvent) the reaction mixture is suitably heated further at the reaction temperature for about 10 minutes to about 360 minutes, preferably for about 30 minutes to about 240 minutes. The working-up can be effected by procedures conventionally used in organic chemistry.<br>
Suitable organic solvents for PROCESS 1 and step a of PROCESS 2 are aprotic non-polar organic solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, preferably aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as aprotic polar solvents such as aliphatic and cyclic carbonates, aliphatic esters and cyclic esters (lactones), aliphatic and cyclic ketones and mixtures thereof.<br>

Preferred examples of aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene, toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, pseudocumene, mesitylen, naphthalene and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons are mono- or polyhalogenated benzene. Especially preferred are chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichloro-benzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene.<br>
Preferred examples of aliphatic and cyclic carbonates are ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and 1,2-butylene carbonate. Preferred examples of aliphatic esters and cyclic esters (lactones) are ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate and n-butyl acetate; and y-butyrolactone. Preferred examples of aliphatic and cyclic ketones are acetone, diethyl ketone and isobutyl methyl ketone; and cyclopentanone and isophorone. Especially preferred are cyclic carbonates and lactones, especially ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate; and y-butyrolactone. Most preferred are the cyclic carbonates, especially ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate and mixtures thereof.<br>
Two-phase solvent systems comprising polar and non-polar solvents may also be used. Examples of non-polar solvents in such two-phase solvent systems are the non-polar solvents named above. Examples of polar solvents in such two-phase solvent systems are the polar solvents named above.<br>
The most preferred two-phase solvent systems are mixtures of ethylene carbonate and/or propylene carbonate and hexane, heptane or octane, especially mixtures of ethylene carbonate and heptane, mixtures of propylene carbonate and octane, and mixtures of ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and heptane.<br>
If the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure, i.e. an absolute pressure of about 0.96 bar to about 1.03 bar, it is preferred to use a two-phase solvent system such as named above (with the same preferences). If the reaction is carried out under pressure, i.e. an absolute pressure of at least 1.03 bar, preferably at an absolute pressure of at least 1.1 bar, more preferably from about 1.1 to about 20.0 bar, even more preferably from about 1.1 to about 6.0 bar, then it is preferred to use an aprotic non-polar solvent such as those named above (with the same preferences). Especially preferred aprotic nompolar solvents are toluene and heptane.<br><br>
The molar ratio of ArOH to the compound of the formula HI and/or IV in the reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 3 : 1 to about 0.8 : 1, preferably from about 2 : 1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 1.75 : 1 to about 1:1, if the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure, i.e. an absolute pressure of about 0.96 bar to about 1.03 bar.<br>
If the reaction is carried out under pressure, i.e. at an absolute pressure of at least 1.03 bar, preferably at an absolute pressure of at least 1.1. bar, more preferably from about 1.1 bar to about 6.0 bar, even more preferably from about 1.1 bar to about 5.1 bar, even especially more preferably from about 1.7 bar to about 5.1 bar, most preferably from about 2.0 to about 3.6 bar, then the molar ratio of the ArOH to a compound represented by formula El or IV, whichever is employed, in thfe reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 1 : 1 to about 1 :1.05, preferably from about 1 : 1.01 to about 1 :1.03.<br>
The amount of the organic solvent used is conveniently from about 0!lO ml to about 6 ml, preferably from about 0.15 ml to about 3 ml, based on 1 mmol of the compound represented by formula HI or IV, whichever is employed, these amounts referring to the total amount of solvent, i.e. regardless of whether the reaction is effected in a single phase (single solvent or a homogeneous solvent mixture) or in a two-phase solvent system.<br>
If the process is carried out in a two-phase solvent system, then the volume ratio of the non-polar solvent to the polar solvent is conveniently in the range from about 1 : 5 to about 30 :1, preferably from about 1: 3 to about 20 : 1, most preferably about 1 :1 to about 15 : 1.<br>
It has been found that the cyclic carbonate used in the two-phase solvent systems can advantageously be recycled several times.<br>
The indium salt used as the catalyst may be present in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 5 mol%, preferably in a relative amount from about 0.1 mol% to about 2 mol%, more preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 1 mol%, most preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mol%, based on compound HI or IV, whichever is employed, In this context the expression "amount of indium salt" is to be un-<br><br>
derstood as referring to the weight of pure indium salt present, even though the catalyst may be impure and/or in the hydrated, form.<br>
Suitably, the reaction temperature for the alkylation is from about 10°C to about 160°C, preferably from about 15°C to about 150°C, more preferably from about 20 to about 150°C, when the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
If the reaction is carried out under an absolute pressure of at least 1.03 bar, preferably of at least 1.1 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 bar to about 20.0 bar, even more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 to about 6.0 bar, then the reaction temperature depends on the applied pressure, but is conveniently from about 106 to about 170°C, preferably from about 112 to about 160°C and more preferably from about 125 to about 150°C.<br>
STEP b of PROCESS 2<br>
This ring closure reaction can be carried out using the same catalysts under substantially the same reaction conditions as described above for the reaction of an aromatic compound featuring at least one hydroxy group (ArOH), especially a phenol of the formula E, with a compound of the formula in and/or IV. Therefore, in cases, where a compound of formula I and optionally one or more double bond isomers thereof are produced according to STEP a, it is sufficient to simply prolong the reaction time of STEP a to realize STEP b, i.e. to prolong the reaction time for about 30 minutes to about 240 minutes. Alternatively or simultaneously the amount of catalyst and/or the reaction temperature can be increased.<br>
PROCESS 3<br>
According to still another aspect of this invention, a compound of formula VH, i.e. a toco-pherol, e.g. a-tocopherol or y-tocopherol, or any other tocol derivative as described in DE-OS 21 60 103 on page 5 in the third and forth paragraph, and an aromatic compound featuring at least one hydroxy group (ArOH) as defined above may be converted into its ester, e.g., its acetate by treatment with an acylating agent in the presence of an indium salt.<br><br>
The acylation in accordance with that aspect of the invention can be carried out using acylating agents conventionally used in the acylation of tocopherols such as anhydrides or hal-ides.<br>
Examples of these are anhydrides or halides of alkanoic acids such as acetic acid, propi-onic acid, pivalic acid, palmitic acid, nicotinic acid arid succinic acid. Typically, acetic anhydride or acid chloride, especially acetic anhydride, is used.<br>
The molar ratio of the aromatic compound featuring at least one hydroxy group (ArOH) or the compound of formula VTt to the acylating agent in the reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 1 : 0.8 to about 1 : 5, preferably from about 1 :1 to about 1 : 3, more preferably from about 1 :1.1 to about 1 :2.<br>
The amount of catalyst used is based on the lesser molar amount of reactant, i.e. ArOH/compound of formula Vlt or acylating agent, and can be in the range of from about 0.006 mol% to about 2.0 mol%, preferably from about 0.0075 mol% to about 1.5 mol%, more preferably from about 0.01 mol% to about 1.0 mol%, in the batchwise mode of operation. For continuous operation, the amount of catalyst will be adjusted to the size of the reactor and the flow of the reactants. It will be appreciated that the determination of the appropriate figures based on the figures for batchwise operation is within normal skill.<br>
The acylation reaction can preferably be carried out at temperatures below about 120°C, more preferably at temperatures from about 15°C to about 120°C, most preferably at temperatures from about 15°C to about 40°C.<br>
The reaction can be carried out essentially in the absence of an additional organic solvent, which is preferred.<br>
"Essentially in the absence of an additional organic solvent" in the context of the present invention means that essentially no organic solvent is present during the reaction and that no organic solvent is deliberately added. It might, however, be possible that traces of organic solvent are present in the starting materials or the catalyst as impurities. In other words, the reaction is carried out in substance; i.e. no other compound except ArOH/compound of formula VII, acetic anhydride and the catalyst is intendedly used for the reaction,<br><br>
so that at the beginning of the reaction the amount of any substance except for the starting material, ArOH/compound of formula VH and acetic anhydride, and except for the catalyst in the reaction mixture is £ 5 weight%, preferably £ 3 weight%, more preferably £ 0.5 weight%, and that no further compound is added during the reaction.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably gaseous nitrogen or argon.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out at an absolute pressure of at least 0.02 bar, preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 0.02 to about 10.0 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 0.02 bar to about 6.0 bar, even more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 0.1 bar to about 5 bar, most preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 0.2 bar to about 3 bar.<br>
It is a particular feature of the acylation according to the present invention that when using chiral aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group or tocol and tocopherols, e.g. (enantiomeric pure) (RJR,R)-y-tocopherol (formula VH with X1 = H, X2 = OH, X3 = X4 = methyl and n = 3), the acylation proceeds substantially without epimerization.<br>

In this aspect, the present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of ct-tocopherol or its alkanoates by<br>
a)      (STEP a) optionally reacting 2,3,5-trimemylhydroquinone or 2,3,6-trimethylh.ydro-quinone 1-alkanoates (both represented by formula Ha)<br><br><br><br>

whereby at least one of the steps a and b is carried out in the presence of an indium salt as the catalyst. To this process it will be referred to in the following as PROCESS 2A.<br>
While in PROCESS 2 A of the present invention the production of (all-rac)-a-tocopherol (formula Vila with R1 = hydrogen) or (all~rac)-a-tocopheryl alkanoate (formula Vila with R1 = acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO, nicotinoyl or palmityl), especially (all-rac)-a-tocopheryl acetate (formula Vila with R1 = acetyl) is preferred, the invention is not limited to the production of that particular isomeric form and other isomeric forms can be obtained by using phytol, isophytol or a derivative thereof as the starting material in the appropriate isomeric form. Thus, e.g. (^,/?,/0-a-tocopherol/(^£^,J?)-a-tocopheryl acetate will be obtained when using (tf^-PTMHQ or (^^)-PTMHQAc or (R,K)-phyiol, (RJijR)-isophytol, (iS^-R^isophytol or (RS.RJI)-isophytol or an appropriate (iso)phytol derivative.<br>

(Figure Remove) <br><br>
Preferred embodiments of PROCESS 3     ..<br>
In this aspect the invention relates to a process for the manufacture of cc-tocopheryl alka-noates (represented by formula VIQ),<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
with an acylating agent characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an indium salt as the catalyst (in the following referred to as PROCESS 3 A).<br>
Concerning the substituent R: preferably R is acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, palmityl, HC^C-CHs-CHz-CO or nicotinoyl, more preferably R is HO2C-CHr-CH2-CO or acetyl, most preferably R is acetyl.<br>
While in an especially preferred embodiment of PROCESS 3 A of the present invention (all-rac)-a-tocopheryl alkanoate (formula VIE; see above), especially (all-rac)-cc-tocopheryl acetate (formula Vm with R = acetyl) is produced, the invention is not limited to the production of that particular isomeric form and other isomeric forms can be obtained by using phytol, isophytol or a derivative thereof as the starting material in the appropriate isomeric form. Thus, (2?^R,l?)-a-tocopheryl alkanoate/acetate will be obtained when using (/2^?rR)-a-tocopherol as starting material, since no epimerization occurs under the reaction conditions.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the (all-rac)-cc-tocopherol obtained by PROCESS 2A is acety-lated after removal of the solvent without further purification with acetic anhydride at room temperature in a short reaction time (up to 10 minutes) and with total conversion. No additional catalyst needs to be used as the indium salt is still present. After acetylation (all-rflc)-cc-tocopheryl acetate has been isolated in excellent yield [&gt;99.5% based on (all-rac)-a-tocopherol].<br>
Concerning the indium salts used in the preferred embodiments, the PROCESSES 1 A, 2A and 3 A. as the catalyst:<br>
In(OTf)3 is especially preferred for the acylation of cc-tocopherol (PROCESS 3 A) and the reaction of TMHQ or TMHQA with a compound represented by formula ffia and/or IVa (PROCESS 1A or STEP a of PROCESS 2A), if carried out in a two-phase solvent system. InClj is the most preferred catalyst if the reaction of TMHQ or TMHQA with a compound represented by formula IEa and/or IVa (PROCESS 1A or STEP a of PROCESS 2A) is carried out in a single phase solvent system.<br>
For PROCESS 1A and 2A the catalyst is most preferred dissolved in water. The concentration of such a solution is not critical.<br>
PROCESS 1A. STEP a of PROCESS 2A<br>
As will be readily apparent, the use of TMHQ as a reactant in this process of the present invention will result in the production of PTMHQ while, when using TMHQA, especially TMHQ Ac, the respective PTMHQA/PTMHQAc will be obtained.<br>
As by-products minor amounts of the isomers of PTMHQ(A), (2)- or(E)-2,3,6-trimethyl-5-(3,7,1 l,15-tetramethyl-hexadec-3-enyl)hydroquinone (1-alkanoate) (represented by the formula Va; see above) and/or 2,3,6-trimethyl-5-[3-(4, 8,12-trimethyl-tridecyl)-but-3-enyl]hydroquinone (1-alkanoate) (represented by the formula Via; see above) may be formed in PROCESS 1A as well as in STEP a of PROCESS 2A.<br><br>
PTMHQ(A) and its isomers represented by the formulae Va and Via are intermediates for the production of a-tocopherol or its alkanoates (final products).<br>
Depending on the activity of the catalyst, its amount and the further reaction conditions, the reaction proceeds to the final product a-tocopherol (alkanoate) (STEPS a and b of PROCESS 2 A) or is slow enough so that these intermediates of the formula la can be isolated (only STEP a of PROCESS 2A is performed).<br>
Preferably TMHQ is reacted with PH and/or IP, more preferably with IP.<br>
Conveniently the reaction of TMHQ(-1 -alkanoate) and a compound of the formula Dla and/or a compound of the formula IVa is carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably gaseous nitrogen or argon. It can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under pressure.<br>
The reaction can be carried out batchwise or continuously, and in general operationally in a very simple manner, for example (i) by adding the compound represented by formula IHa or IVa- as such or dissolved in the non-polar solvent (if the reaction is carried out in a non-polar solvent or a two-phase solvent system) such as mentioned below, preferably as such — portionwise or continuously to a mixture of the catalyst, TMHQ or its 1-alkanoates and the solvent/two-phase solvent system.<br>
It is also possible (ii) to add subsequently the catalyst, preferably as such or as aqueous solution, and the compound represented by the formula ffla or IVa - as such or dissolved in the non-polar solvent (if the reaction is carried out in a non-polar solvent or a two-phase solvent system) such as mentioned below, preferably as such - to TMHQ or its 1-alkanoates and the solvent/two-phase solvent system.<br>
Conveniently, the compound of the formula Ufa and/or IVa is added continuously to TMHQ or its 1-alkanoates within about 15 to about 180 minutes, preferably within about 30 to about 150 minutes, more preferably within about 45 to about 130 minutes, if the reaction is carried out in a single solvent, especially an aprotic non-polar solvent. If the reaction is carried out in a two-phase solvent system, the feed rate is not critical. The catalyst is<br><br>
preferably added at once to the mixture of TMHQ or its 1-alkanoates and the solvent/two-phase solvent system having already reached the reaction temperature.<br>
After completion of the addition of the compound represented by formula ffla or IVa (in the non-polar solvent) the reaction mixture is suitably heated further at the reaction temperature for aboutlO minutes to about 360 minutes, preferably for about 30 minutes to about 240 minutes. The working-up can be effected by procedures conventionally used in organic chemistry.<br>
Suitably, the reaction temperature for the alkylation is from about 10°C to about 160°C, preferably from about 15°C to about 150°C, more preferably from about 20°C to about 150°C, when the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
If the reaction is carried out underpressure, i.e. at an absolute pressure of at least 1.03 bar, preferably at an absolute pressure of at least 1.1 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 to about 20.0 bar, even more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 to about 6.0 bar, then the reaction temperature depends on the applied pressure, but is conveniently from about 106 to about 170°C, preferably from about 112 to about 160°C and more preferably from about 125 to about 150°C.<br>
If the reaction is carried out under pressure, i.e. at an absolute pressure of at least 1.03 bar, preferably an aprotic non-polar organic solvent such as an aliphatic hydrocarbon, a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon and mixtures thereof are used. Examples and their preferences are the same as given above for PROCESS 1 and step a of PROCESS 2.<br>
If the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure, i.e. a pressure of from about 0.96 bar to about 1.03 bar, the reaction is preferably carried out in a two-phase solvent system comprising polar and non-polar solvents. Examples of non-polar solvents and polar solvents in such two-phase solvent systems and their preferences are the same as named above for PROCESS 1 or step a of PROCESS 2.<br>
The molar ratio of TMHQ or its 1-alkanoates to a compound represented by formula ffia and/or IVa in the reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 3 :1 to about 0.8 :1,<br><br>
preferably from about 2 :1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 1.75 : 1 to about 1 : 1, if the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure, i.e. an absolute pressure of about 0.96 bar to about 1.03 bar.<br>
If the reaction is carried out underpressure, i.e. at an absolute pressure of at least 1.03 bar, preferably of at least 1.1 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 bar to about 6,0 bar, even more preferably from about 1.1 bar to about 5.1 bar, even especially more preferably from about 1.7 bar to about 5.1 bar, most preferably from about 2.0 to about 3.6 bar, then the molar ratio of TMHQ or its 1-alkanoates to a compound represented by formula ma and/or IVa, whichever is employed, in the reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 1:1 to about 1:1.05, preferably from about 1 :1.01 to about 1:1.03.<br>
The amount of organic solvent used is conveniently from about 0.10 ml to about 6 ml, preferably from about 0.15 ml to about 3 ml, based on 1 mmol of the compound represented by formula Ula or IVa, whichever is employed, these amounts referring to the total amount of solvent, i.e. regardless of whether the reaction is effected in a single phase (single solvent or a solvent mixture) or hi a two-phase solvent system.<br>
If the process is carried out at atmospheric pressure and in a two-phase solvent system, then the volume ratio of the non-polar solvent to the polar solvent is conveniently in the range from about 1: 5 to about 30 :1, preferably from about 1: 3 to about 20 :1, most preferably about 1:1 to about 15:1.<br>
It has been found that the cyclic carbonate used in the two-phase solvent systems can advantageously be recycled several times.<br>
The indium salt used as the catalyst may be present in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 5 mol%, preferably in a relative amount from about 0.1 mol% to about 2 mol%, more preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 1 mol%, most preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mol%, based on compound ffla or IVa, whichever is employed. In this context the expression "amount of indium salt" is to be understood as referring to the weight of pure indium salt present, even though the catalyst may be impure and/or in the hydrated form.<br><br>
STEP b of PROCESS 2A<br>
As will be readily apparent, the use of PTMHQ or an isomer thereof as a reactant in the process of this invention will result in the preparation of ct-tocopherol while, when using a PTMHQA or an isomer thereof, the respective oc-tocophervl alkanoate will be obtained.<br>
As the starting material PTMHQ or PTMHQA and optionally one or more isomers thereof, which are obtained as minor by-products in the manufacture of PTMHQ or PTMHQA, prepared to any method known to the person skilled in the art can be used.<br>
This ring closure can be carried out using the same catalysts under substantially the same reaction conditions as described above for the reaction of TMHQ or TMHQA represented by formula Ha with a compound of the formula Ola and/or IVa. Therefore, in cases, where PTMHQ or PTMHQA and optionally one or more isomers thereof are produced according to STEP a, it is sufficient to simply prolong the reaction time of STEP a to realize STEP b, i.e. to prolong the reaction time for about 30 minutes to about 240 minutes. Alternatively or simultaneously the amount of catalyst and/or the reaction temperature can be increased.<br>
PROCESS 3A<br>
According to still another aspect of this invention, a-tocopherol maybe converted into its alkanoate, e.g. its acetate, by treatment with an acylating agent in the presence of an indium salt.<br>
The acylation in accordance with that aspect of the invention can be carried out under the same reaction conditions as already described for PROCESS 3.<br>
It is a particular feature of the acylation according to the present invention that when using (R,R,R)-a-tocopherol, the acylation proceeds substantially without epimerization. Thus, if for example (J?,^,R)-a-tocopherol is used as starting material for PROCESS 3A, (RJtJfy-a-tocopheryl alkanoate is obtained.<br><br>
PROCESS 4<br>
According to sill another aspect of this invention, a-tocopherol, (3-tocopherol, y-tocopherol and 8-tocopherol as defined in DE-OS 21 60 103 (page 5, third paragraph) and obtained according to the process of the present invention may be converted into then- alkanoates, e.g. their acetates, by treatment with an acylating agent.<br>
The acylation in accordance with that .aspect of the invention can be carried out according to processes already known by the person skilled in the art.<br>
Process for the manufacture of formulations of a-tocopherol or its alkanoates<br>
The a-tocopherol or its alkanoate obtained by one of the PROCESSES 1,2,3, 3 A or 4 can further be formulated by any method known to the person skilled in the art, e.g. as those disclosed in US 6,162,474, US 2001/0009679, US 6,180,130, US 6,426,078, US 6,030,645, US 6,150,086, US 6,146,825, US 6,001,554, US 5,938,990, US 6,530,684, US 6,536,940, US 2004/0053372, US 5,668,183, US 5,891,907, US 5,350,773, US 6,020,003, US 6,329,423, WO 96/32949, US 5,234,695, WO 00/27362, EP 0 664 116, US 2002/0127303, US 5,478,569, US 5,925,381, US 6,651,898, US 6,358,301, US 6,444,227, WO 96/01103 and WO 98/15195.<br>

Especially the present invention relates to the use of an indium salt as the catalyst in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of aromatic compounds featuring at least one hydroxy group hi an organic solvent, as well as to the use of an indium salt as the catalyst in ring-closure reactions to produce chroman-ring compounds in an organic solvent.<br><br>

With Inda excellent yields were obtained in both solvents, heptane and toluene. The selectivity for the formation of the desired 6-membered ring product (all-roc)-TCP with this catalyst was very high compared to results with In(OTf)3 as a difference of 28 to 30% for the selectivity was observed.<br>
It was also found that a small excess of IP (+1.38%) led to a much better yield (see Table 11, example 58). In fact, (all-rac)-TCP could be isolated in 93.9% yield after work-up. It has to be emphasized that at atmospheric pressure a TMHQ/ff ratio of 1.5/1 was used whereas, under pressure, an equimolar- ratio was sufficient to produce the desired chroman ring compound (all-rac)-TCP in excellent yield.<br>
It is noteworthy that the proportion of TMHQ used for these reactions under pressure was twenty-fold higher than at atmospheric pressure (4 mol/1 instead of 0.2 mol/1) and it did not affect the yield of the reaction.<br>

When the amount of InCls was reduced to 0.25 mol% (all-rac)-TCP was obtained in good yield (see Table 12, examples 62 and 63). However a longer reaction time (e.g. up to 566 minutes in toluene) was needed to obtain nearly total ring closure.<br>
It appeared that a good balance between selectivity for (all-rac)-TCP, yield and catalyst amount was the use of 2 mol% InCU, especially in heptane. In toluene and in heptane, the desired chroman product (all-rac)-TCP could be isolated in up to 95.5 % yield.<br>
