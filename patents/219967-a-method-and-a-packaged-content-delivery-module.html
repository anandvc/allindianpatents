The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1053/MUMNP/2005<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method and a packaged content delivery module.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to networks. In particular, the invention relates to content delivery.<br>
2.        Description of Related Art<br>
Information distribution over a network is becoming more and more popular. Users now can have access to thousands of network databases and content providers to retrieve news, articles, files, stock quotes, music files, video clips, etc. with ease. In many instances, content providers download data, news, and files to the subscribers automatically.<br>
As demands for information access become higher and higher, it becomes economical to package the information contents for efficient delivery and discovery. However, the abundant supply of information has created several problems. The interests of users change over time, leading to difficulties in sorting out relevant information. The users" platforms or computer systems are constantly upgraded with new hardware and software, making presentation of information at the user"s site less effective.<br>
Existing packaging techniques merely bundle files into a .zip or .tar file. The content is usually compressed and integrated without any categorization or discrimination of information. These techniques provide no useful information about the content other than the names and sizes of the individual files.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have an efficient technique to package content for delivery.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention in which:<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is a technique to deliver content to a subsystem or node in a network. A package is composed for delivery to have package elements corresponding content of the packaged content. The package and the package elements are tagged using meta-data. The meta-data are then serialized and combined with the package elements into a serialized packaged content compatible with a receiving subsystem using a markup language.<br>
The content is collected or gathered from several content sources. The content is encapsulated into packages with associated annotation and their respective meta-data information. The packages, once created, are used as units of distribution over the broadcast network.<br>
A package is a logical grouping of media and other data files with associated meta¬data about the content. A package is made up of package elements. Both the package and its package elements may have associated meta-data. Meta-data is defined as content or media descriptor tags that characterize the package elements and the package so that the corresponding content can be used in an intelligent manner within the broadcast network. The package elements may include HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages, MP3 files, QuickTime movies, video clips, or any other suitable content. A package is independent of network and transmission mechanisms and policies. A package is represented in the file system with a unique identifier and package markup language data.<br>
The meta-data assigned to the package and the package elements is unchanged in the system. In other words, the meta-data used at the sender and the receiver have the same meaning. The receiving subsystem may add additional meta-data, but the original meta-data as composed by the content originator with the delivered packaged content remains unchanged.<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention. In other instances, well-known electrical structures and circuits are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the present invention.<br><br>

The packaged content delivery module 25 or the packaged content receiver 55 may have several modules coupled to one another. A software module is coupled to another module to receive variables, parameters, arguments, pointers, etc. and/or to generate or pass results, updated variables, pointers, etc. A software module may also be a software driver or interface to interact with the operating system running on the platform. A software module may also be a hardware driver to configure, set up, initialize, send and receive data to and from a hardware device.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating the packaged content delivery module 25 shown in Figure 1A according to one embodiment of the invention. The packaged content delivery module 25 includes a package generator 210, a cache manager 230, and a native<br><br>
file system 250. The packaged content delivery module 25 may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software.<br>
The package generator 210 collects the content from the content sources 30 and generates the packaged content 27 for delivery to the receiving subsystem 50 (Figure 1 A). The package generator 210 includes a package composer 212, a packaged content tagger 214, and a packaged content serializer 216. The package composer 212 composes a package from the collected content. The packaged content tagger 214 tags the package and its package elements with meta-data, which describes or characterizes the corresponding package elements and the package. The packaged content serializer 216 produced the packaged content ready for delivery with appropriate markup language.<br>
The cache manager 230 manages cache memories of the platform on which the package generator 210 operates. The cache manager 230 provides storage mechanism for the content and the meta-data used by the package generator 210. The file system 250 provides an environment to organize data, content, files into an hierarchical file organization. The file system 250 provides directories, subdirectories and other file facilities to facilitate the file management.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating the package composer 212 shown in Figure 2 according to one embodiment of the invention. The package composer 212 includes a collector 310, and an organizer 330.<br>
The collector 310 collects or gathers the content from the content sources 30 into a post-production site to create a package 320, The content sources 30 may include the Web content 32, the re-purposed Web content 34, the produced content 36, and other external content sources 38. The content may include HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages, MP3 files, QuickTime movies, video clips, or any other suitable content.   Any content source or provider may act as a content originator or a content aggregator depending on the exact nature of the business models and alliances with other content sources.<br>
The organizer 330 organizes the collected content into N package elements 3351 to 335N for the package 320. Each package element 335k corresponds to a content type. For example, the package element 3351 may correspond to an MP3 file, the package element 3352 may correspond to an HTML page, the package element 3353 may correspond to<br><br>
another HTML page, etc. The organizer 330 provides a unique identifier to each of the package elements 335t to 335N. The organizer 330 also interacts with the file system 250 (Figure 2) to store the package elements into a set of files or directories/ subdirectories that contain audio, video, data, script, executables, and other content types.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram illustratirt: the packaged content tagger 214 shown in Figure 2 according to one embodiment of the invention. The packaged content tagger 214 includes an element tagger 410, a package element grouper 450, a package tagger 470, a meta-data 430, and a package marker 490.<br>
The element tagger 410 and the package tagger 470 interface with the meta-data 430 to obtain tags that characterize the package elements 3351 to 335N and the package 320. The element tagger 410 assigns a tag from the meta-data 430 to each of the package elements.<br>
The meta-data 430 includes tags or descriptors for the package elements and the package 320. The tags for the package elements include an element name tag 432, an element location tag 434, a content originator tag 436, a content expiration tag 438, a content presentation tag 440, a content filtering tag 442, a platform tag 444, and a personalization tag 446. The tags for the package 320 include a package identity tag 448. The element name tag 432 is the name of the package element. The element location tag 434 indicates the location of the package element within the package according to some pre-defined location protocol. For example, the element location tag 434 may be an absolute address, a relative address, or a pointer to the corresponding package element. The content originator tag 436 provides information about the content provider that provides the content corresponding to the package element. The information may include the identifier, URL, and content type. The content expiration tag 438 indicates the content lifetime within the network. The content presentation tag 440 is used by the presentation engine in the receiver subsystem for rendering the end-user experience. The content filtering tag 442 indicates how the content should be categorized for filtering. The content filtering tag 442 may be used by heuristics that range from simple matching to correlation matching. The platform tag 444 is used to tailor the package element to specific platform capabilities. The content personalization tag 446 is used to personalize the content filtering and presentation to personal preferences for users on the receiver subsystem. The   .<br><br>
package identity tag 448 indicates the package identifier and/or the package element identifiers.<br>
The package element grouper 450 groups the tagged package elements into logical groups based on some pre-defined criteria. For example, package elements having the same tags may be grouped together. The package element grouper 450 generates grouped tagged package elements 455.<br>
The package tagger 470 tags the package 320 with the corresponding package tags. The package marker 490 marks the tagged package for inclusion in a piaylist 495 that becomes part of the packaged content to be delivered.<br>
Figure 5 is a diagram illustrating the packaged content serializer 216 shown in Figure 2 according to one embodiment of the invention. The packaged content serializer 216 includes a representer 510, a schema 530, and a transformer 550.<br>
The representer 510 represents the element tags and the package tag for the package 320 using the schema 530. The schema 530 provides a framework for the representation. Typically, the schema 530 follows some universal standard or protocol so that the delivery packaged content becomes independent of the network and the transmission medium mechanisms and policies. In one embodiment, the schema 530 is based on the extensible markup language (XML). The representer 510 generates markup language elements 515)to 515N and markup language package 518 corresponding to the element tags 415i to 41 5N and the package tag 475, respectively.<br>
The transformer 550 combines the markup language elements 5151to 515N, the markup language package 518 and the package 320 or the piaylist 495 with all the package elements 335t to 335H and transform into a serialized package markup language packaged content 555. The serialized package markup language packaged content 555 becomes the delivery packaged content 27 (Figure 1) to be delivered to the receiving subsystem 50. The delivery packaged content 27 is also compatible with the file system 250 (Figure 2) which is compatible with the file system of the receiver subsystem 50.<br>
Figure 6 is a diagram illustrating the packaged content receiver 55 shown in Figure 1 according to one embodiment of the invention. The packaged content receiver 55<br><br>
includes a receiver interface 610,a receiver meta-data 618, user"s settings 615, a receiver organizer 630 a cache manager 650, and a receiver file system 660.<br>
The receiver interface 610 receives the delivery packaged content 27 and parses the delivery packaged content 27 according tp some pre-defined preferences such as receiver user"s settings 615. The receiver interface 610 may also tags the delivery packaged content 27 with the receiver meta-data 618. The receiver interface 610 then generates a pre-processed package 620 having content modified according to the receiver user"s settings 615. For example, the receiver interface 610 may retain the package elements that have the filtering tags matching the user"s filtering criteria set at the receiver subsystem 50. As another example, the receiver interface 610 may discard the package elements that have the expiration tags (e.g., obsolete news articles) exceeding the limit set by the receiver user.<br>
The receiver organizer 630 organizes the pre-processed package 620 according to the receiver file system 660. The cache manager 650 manages cache memories of the platform on which the receiver organizer 630 operates. The cache manager 650 provides storage mechanism for the organized package. The receiver organizer 630 also uses the tagged receiver meta-data when organizing the packaged content. By sorting out the packaged content according to well-defined criteria and settings, the packaged content receiver 55 allows the receiver user to access the packaged content in an intelligent manner, personalized to user"s preferences and criteria.<br>
While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the illustrative embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention, which are apparent to persons skilled in the art to which the invention pertains are deemed to lie within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
