				<td>Novel Products<br>
The present invention relates to novel products in the form of<br>
electronic or electrical devices, which are treated to protect<br>
them from liquid damage, for example from environmental damage<br>
in particular from water or other liquids, as well as to<br>
processes for their production.<br>
It is well known that electronic and electrical devices are<br>
very sensitive to damage caused by contamination by liquids<br>
such as environmental liquids, in particular water. Contact<br>
with liquids, either in the course of normal use or as a result<br>
of accidental exposure, can lead to short circuiting between<br>
electronic components, and irreparable damage to circuit<br>
boards, electronic chips etc.<br>
The problem is particularly acute in relation to small portable<br>
electronic equipment such as mobile phones, pagers, radios,<br>
hearing aids, laptop, notebook, palmtop computers and personal<br>
digital assistants (PDAs), which can be exposed to significant<br>
liquid contamination when moved outside. In addition, they are<br>
prone to accidental exposure to liquids, for example if dropped<br>
or splashed.<br>
In addition, other types of electronic or electrical devices<br>
are particularly prone to for example, environmental damage<br>
because of their location, for example outdoor lighting<br>
systems, radio antenna and other forms of communication<br>
equipment.<br>
However, most devices of this type are damaged by accidental<br>
spillage or the like. Particular examples may include desktop<br>
devices such as keyboards, or instrumentation for instance used<br>
in control rooms.<br><br>
A particular problem arises in relation to devices which are<br>
used in sound reproduction and which utilise transducers such<br>
as loudspeakers, microphones, ringers and buzzers. These are<br>
particularly susceptible to damage by liquid contamination,<br>
either as a result of accidental exposure or from environmental<br>
factors such as rain or spray in use. In many cases, the<br>
membranes or diaphragms used in the devices, particularly the<br>
most economical ones, are liquid absorbent to some degree, and<br>
when exposed to water for example, will absorb considerable<br>
amounts. This affects the operability of the transducer<br>
significantly and the quality of the sound reproduction<br>
therefore suffers.<br>
Many microphones are provided with an open-pore foamed plastic<br>
enclosure surrounding the transducer. However, these must be<br>
gas permeable and they do not provide complete protection<br>
against liquid contamination.<br>
In the past, this problem has been addressed by introducing<br>
further water protective measures in the microphones. In many<br>
cases, these comprise water-impermeable porous membranes such<br>
as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes (see for example<br>
WO/01/03468 or USP 5,420,570) into the device. In all cases,<br>
these membranes will reduce the sensitivity of the transducer<br>
and therefore have an adverse impact on sound quality.<br>
In other cases, such as that described in GB 2,364,463, more<br>
rigid protective covers are provided, which are solid and holes<br>
into which pick-up devices are inserted. This solution is<br>
costly and complex and only suitable in certain limited<br>
situations.<br>
Plasma deposition techniques have been quite widely used for<br>
the deposition of polymeric coatings onto a range of surfaces,<br>
and in particular onto fabric surfaces. This technique is<br>
recognised as being a clean, dry technique that generates<br><br>
little waste compared to conventional wet chemical methods.<br>
Using this method, plasmas are generated from organic<br>
molecules, which are subjected to an electrical field. When<br>
this is done in the presence of a substrate, the radicals of<br>
the compound in the plasma polymerise on the substrate.<br>
Conventional polymer synthesis tends to produce structures<br>
containing repeat units that bear a strong resemblance to the<br>
monomer species, whereas a polymer network, generated using a<br>
plasma can be extremely complex. The properties of the<br>
resultant coating can depend upon the nature of the substrate<br>
as well as the nature of the monomer used and conditions under<br>
which it is deposited.<br>
The applicants have found that by utilising a specific type of<br>
monomer under particular deposition conditions, electronic or<br>
electrical devices having highly liquid repellent nano-coatings<br>
thereon can be produced, which does not affect the efficacy of<br>
the device.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an<br>
electronic or electrical device having a polymeric coating,<br>
formed by exposing said device to pulsed plasma comprising a<br>
compound of formula (I)<br><br>
where R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen,<br>
alkyl, haloalkyl or aryl optionally substituted by halo; and R4<br>
is a group X-R5 where R5 is an alkyl or haloalkyl group and X<br>
is a bond; a group of formula -C(O)O(CH2)nY- where n is an<br>
integer of from 1 to 10 and Y is a bond or a sulphonamide<br>
group; or a group - (O)pR6(O)q(CH2)t- where R6 is aryl optionally<br>
substituted by halo, p is 0 or 1, q is 0 or 1 and t is 0 or an<br>
integer of from 1 to 10, provided that where q is 1, t is other<br><br>
than 0, for a sufficient period of time to allow a protective<br>
polymeric layer to form on the surface of the electrical or<br>
electronic device.<br>
As used herein, the expression "in a gaseous state" refers to<br>
gases or vapours, either alone or in mixture, as well as<br>
aerosols.<br>
The expression "protective polymeric layer" refers to polymeric<br>
layers which provide some protection against liquid damage, and<br>
in particular are liquid (such as oil- and water-) repellent.<br>
Sources of liquids from which the devices are protected include<br>
environmental liquids such as water, and in particular rain, as<br>
well as any other oil or liquid, which may be accidentally<br>
spilled.<br>
As used herein, the term "electronic or electrical device"<br>
refers includes any piece of electrical or electronic equipment<br>
which may be used, as well as components thereof such as<br>
printed circuit boards (PCBs), transistors, resistors,<br>
electronic components or semi-conductor chips. In particular<br>
however, the coating is applied to the outer surface of a fully<br>
assembled device, for example the fully assembled mobile phone,<br>
or microphone. In such cases, the polymer layer will be<br>
applied to, for example an outer casing or foam cover, as well<br>
as any exposed components such as control buttons or switches,<br>
so as to prevent any liquid reaching the components within.<br>
The applicants have found that the polymer layer forms across<br>
the entire surface of the device, including where the device<br>
includes different substrate materials, such as a combination<br>
of different plastics (including foamed plastic), metals and/or<br>
glass surfaces, and surprisingly therefore, the entire device<br>
is made liquid repellent. Even where these are not in a watertight<br>
relationship, for example push buttons on a mobile phone<br>
which are not fused to the surrounding casing, the polymer<br><br>
layer deposited in this way is sufficiently repellent to<br>
prevent liquids penetrating the device around the edge of the<br>
buttons into the device. Thus it has been found that mobile<br>
phones for example, which are generally very sensitive to<br>
liquid damage, can be fully immersed in water after the<br>
treatment of the invention, without any lasting harm.<br>
As the coating is carried out without requiring immersion in<br>
any liquids, there is no risk to the operation of the device as<br>
a result of exposure to this procedure.<br>
This broad applicability makes the present procedure<br>
particularly advantageous.<br>
Particular examples of electrical and electronic devices<br>
include communications devices such as mobile phones and<br>
pagers, radios, and sound and audio systems such as<br>
loudspeakers, microphones, ringers or buzzers, hearing aids,<br>
personal audio equipment such as personal CD, tape cassette or<br>
MP3 players, televisions, DVD players including portable DVD<br>
players, video recorders, digi and other set-top boxes such as<br>
Sky, computers and related components such as laptop, notebook<br>
or palmtop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs),<br>
keyboards, or instrumentation, games consoles in particular<br>
hand-held playstations and the like, or outdoor lighting<br>
systems.<br>
Other particular examples may include electrical or electronic<br>
components which are particularly at risk of water<br>
contamination, such as those used in transport vehicles include<br>
aircraft and other transport equipment such as trains,<br>
automobiles in addition to other vehicles such as those used by<br>
the Military, and other devices such as washing machines and<br>
dishwashers.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment, the electronic or electrical device<br>
is a microphone. By utilising the method defined above, highly<br>
advantageous microphones have been produced. In particular,<br>
the main features and benefits of using this approach are that<br>
by coating for example the casing in particular the foam cover<br>
of the microphone, the transducer is protected from liquid<br>
contamination without any loss of sound quality. Levels of<br>
protection equal to or better than those achieved using<br>
membranes are achieved without any resultant "muffling" of the<br>
sound quality, which is a feature of the use of such membranes.<br>
When applied to the foam cover, the layer does not affect<br>
porosity of the foam. In other words, the layer is not<br>
sufficient to block the pores of the foam or to affect the air<br>
permeability in any way. However, the entire surface of the<br>
pores is made liquid repellent, and this is sufficient to<br>
ensure that liquids do not penetrate the foam.<br>
However, similar advantages occur in relation to devices which<br>
incorporate small microphones such as communications devices<br>
and sound and audio systems as defined above, and in particular<br>
mobile phones, where coating of the finished phone may further<br>
enhance the levels of protection.<br>
Electronic or electrical devices treated in this way are<br>
protected to a significant degree, against water and oil<br>
damage.<br>
Precise conditions under which the plasma polymerization takes<br>
place in an effective manner will vary depending upon factors<br>
such as the nature of the polymer, the electrical or electronic<br>
device etc. and will be determined using routine methods and/or<br>
the techniques.<br>
Suitable plasmas for use in the method of the invention include<br>
non-equilibrium plasmas such as those generated by<br><br>
radiofrequencies (Rf), microwaves or direct current (DC). They<br>
may operate at atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressures as are<br>
known in the art. In particular however, they are generated by<br>
radiofrequencies (Rf).<br>
Various forms of equipment may be used to generate gaseous<br>
plasmas. Generally these comprise containers or plasma<br>
chambers in which plasmas may be generated. Particular<br>
examples of such equipment are described for instance in<br>
WO2005/089961 and WO02/28548, the content of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, but many other conventional<br>
plasma generating apparatus are available.<br>
In general, the item to be treated is placed within a plasma<br>
chamber together with the material to be deposited in gaseous<br>
state, a glow discharge is ignited within the chamber and a<br>
suitable voltage is applied, which may be pulsed.<br>
The gas used within the plasma may comprise a vapour of the<br>
monomeric compound alone, but it may be combined with a carrier<br>
gas, in particular, an inert gas such as helium or argon. In<br>
particular helium is a preferred carrier gas as this can<br>
minimises fragmentation of the monomer.<br>
When used as a mixture, the relative amounts of the monomer<br>
vapour to carrier gas is suitably determined in accordance with<br>
procedures which are conventional in the art. The amount of<br>
monomer added will depend to some extent on the nature of the<br>
particular monomer being used, the nature of the laboratory<br>
disposable being treated, the size of the plasma chamber etc.<br>
Generally, in the case of conventional chambers, monomer is<br>
delivered in an amount of from 50-250mg/min, for example at a<br>
rate of from 100-150mg/min. Carrier gas such as helium is<br>
suitably administered at a constant rate for example at a rate<br>
of from 5-90, for example from 15-30sccm. In some instances,<br>
the ratio of monomer to carrier gas will be in the range of<br><br>
from 100:1 to 1:100, for instance in the range of from 10:1 to<br>
1:100, and in particular about 1:1 to 1:10. The precise ratio<br>
selected will be so as to ensure that the flow rate required by<br>
the process is achieved.<br>
Alternatively, the monomer may be delivered into the chamber by<br>
way of an aerosol device such as a nebuliser or the like, as<br>
described for example in WO2003/097245 and WO03/101621, the<br>
content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In some cases, a preliminary continuous power plasma may be<br>
struck for example for from 2-10 minutes for instance for about<br>
4 minutes, within the chamber. This may act as a surface pre-<br>
treatment step, ensuring that the monomer attaches itself<br>
readily to the surface, so that as polymerisation occurs, the<br>
coating "grows" on the surface. The pre-treatment step may be<br>
conducted before monomer is introduced into the chamber, in the<br>
presence of only the inert gas.<br>
The plasma is then suitably switched to a pulsed plasma to<br>
allow polymerisation to proceed, at least when the monomer is<br>
present.<br>
In all cases, a glow discharge is suitably ignited by applying<br>
a high frequency voltage, for example at 13.56MHz. This is<br>
suitably applied using electrodes, which may be internal or<br>
external to the chamber, but in the case of the larger chambers<br>
are internal.<br>
Suitably the gas, vapour or gas mixture is supplied at a rate<br>
of at least 1 standard cubic centimetre per minute (sccm) and<br>
preferably in the range of from 1 to 100sccm.<br>
In the case of the monomer vapour, this is suitably supplied at<br>
a rate of from 80-300mg/minute, for example at about 120mg per<br><br>
minute depending upon the nature of the monomer, whilst the<br>
pulsed voltage is applied.<br>
Gases or vapours may be drawn or pumped into the plasma region.<br>
In particular, where a plasma chamber is used, gases or vapours<br>
may be drawn into the chamber as a result of a reduction in the<br>
pressure within the chamber, caused by use of an evacuating<br>
pump, or they may be pumped or injected into the chamber as is<br>
common in liquid handling.<br>
Polymerisation is suitably effected using vapours of compounds<br>
of formula (I), which are maintained at pressures of from 0.1<br>
to 200mtorr, suitably at about 80-100mtorr.<br>
The applied fields are suitably of power of from 40 to 500W,<br>
suitably at about 100W peak power, applied as a pulsed field.<br>
The pulses are applied in a sequence which yields very low<br>
average powers, for example in a sequence in which the ratio of<br>
the time on : time off is in the range of from 1:500 to 1:1500.<br>
Particular examples of such sequence are sequences where power<br>
is on for 20-50μs, for example about 30μs, and off for from<br>
lOOOps to 30000μs, in particular about 20000μs. Typical<br>
average powers obtained in this way are 0.01W.<br>
The fields are suitably applied from 30 seconds to 90 minutes,<br>
preferably from 5 to 60 minutes, depending upon the nature of<br>
the compound of formula (I) and the electrical or electronic<br>
device etc.<br>
Suitably a plasma chamber used is of sufficient volume to<br>
accommodate multiple electrical or electronic devices, in<br>
particular when these are small in size, for example up to<br>
20,000 microphone heads can be processed at the same time with<br>
ease and much more is capably with the correct size equipment.<br><br>
A particularly suitable apparatus and method for producing<br>
electrical or electronic devices in accordance with the<br>
invention is described in WO2005/089961, the content of which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In particular, when using high volume chambers of this type,<br>
the plasma is created with a voltage as a pulsed field, at an<br>
average power of from 0.001 to 500w/m3, for example at from<br>
0.001 to 100w/m3 and suitably at from 0.005 to 0.5w/m3.<br>
These conditions are particularly suitable for depositing good<br>
quality uniform coatings, in large chambers, for example in<br>
chambers where the plasma zone has a volume of greater than<br>
500cm3, for instance 0.5m3 or more, such as from 0.5m3-10m3 and<br>
suitably at about 1m3. The layers formed in this way have good<br>
mechanical strength.<br>
The dimensions of the chamber will be selected so as to<br>
accommodate the particular electrical or electronic device<br>
being treated. For instance, generally cuboid chambers may be<br>
suitable for a wide range of applications, but if necessary,<br>
elongate or rectangular chambers may be constructed or indeed<br>
cylindrical, or of any other suitable shape.<br>
The chamber may be a sealable container, to allow for batch<br>
processes, or it may comprise inlets and outlets for electrical<br>
or electronic devices, to allow it to be utilised in a<br>
continuous process. In particular in the latter case, the<br>
pressure conditions necessary for creating a plasma discharge<br>
within the chamber are maintained using high volume pumps, as<br>
is conventional for example in a device with a "whistling<br>
leak". However it will also be possible to process certain<br>
items at atmospheric pressure, or close to, negating the need<br>
for "whistling leaks"<br><br>
The monomers used are selected from monomers of formula (I) as<br>
defined above. Suitable haloalkyl groups for R1, R2, R3 and R5<br>
are fluoroalkyl groups. The alkyl chains may be straight or<br>
branched and may include cyclic moieties.<br>
For R5, the alkyl chains suitably comprise 2 or more carbon<br>
atoms, suitably from 2-20 carbon atoms and preferably from 6 to<br>
12 carbon atoms.<br>
For R1, R2 and R3, alkyl chains are generally preferred to have<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably R5 is a haloalkyl, and more preferably a<br>
perhaloalkyl group, particularly a perfluoroalkyl group of<br>
formula CmF2m+1 where m is an integer of 1 or more, suitably<br>
from 1-20, and preferably from 4-12 such as 4, 6 or 8.<br>
Suitable alkyl groups for R1, R2 and R3 have from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is hydrogen. In<br>
a particular embodiment R1, R2, R3 are all hydrogen. In yet a<br>
further embodiment however R3 is an alkyl group such as methyl<br>
or propyl.<br>
Where X is a group -C(O)O(CH2)nY-, n is an integer which<br>
provides a suitable spacer group. In particular, n is from 1<br>
to 5, preferably about 2.<br>
Suitable sulphonamide groups for Y include those of formula -<br>
N(R7)SO2" where R7 is hydrogen or alkyl such as C2-4alkyl, in<br>
particular methyl or ethyl.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is a compound of<br>
formula (II)<br><br>
CH2=CH-R5 (II)<br>
where R5 is as defined above in relation to formula (I).<br>
In compounds of formula (II), X in formula (I) is a bond.<br>
However in a preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (I)<br>
is an acrylate of formula (III)<br>
CH2=CR7C(O)O(CH2)nR5 (III)<br>
where n and R5 as defined above in relation to formula (I) and<br>
R7 is hydrogen, C1-10 alkyl, or C1-10haloalkyl. In particular R7<br>
is hydrogen or C1-6alkyl such as methyl. A particular example<br>
of a compound of formula (III) is a compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
where R7 is as defined above, and in particular is hydrogen and<br>
x is an integer of from 1 to 9, for instance from 4 to 9, and<br>
preferably 7. In that case, the compound of formula (IV) is<br>
1H,1H, 2H, 2H-heptadecafluorodecylacylate.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for<br>
protecting an electrical or electronic device against liquid<br>
damage said method comprising exposing said device to a pulsed<br>
plasma comprising a compound of formula (I)<br><br><br>
where R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen,<br>
alkyl, haloalkyl or aryl optionally substituted by halo; and<br>
R4 is a group X-R6 where R5 is an alkyl or haloalkyl group and X<br>
is a bond; a group of formula -C(O)O{CH2)nY- where n is an<br>
integer of from 1 to 10 and Y is a bond or a sulphonamide<br>
group; or a group - (O)PR6(O)q(CH2)t- where R6 is aryl optionally<br>
substituted by halo, p is 0 or 1, q is 0 or 1 and t is 0 or an<br>
integer of from 1 to 10, provided that where q is 1, t is other<br>
than 0,<br>
in a gaseous state for a sufficient period of time to allow a<br>
protective polymeric layer to form on the surface of the<br>
electrical or electronic device.<br>
Liquid damage from which these devices are protected include<br>
environmental liquids such as water and in particular rain, or<br>
any other liquid, which may be accidentally spilled onto the<br>
device.<br>
Suitably, the electrical or electronic device is placed in a<br>
plasma deposition chamber, a glow discharge is ignited within<br>
said chamber, and a voltage applied as a pulsed field.<br>
Suitable monomers and reaction conditions for use in this<br>
method are as described above.<br>
The invention will now be particularly described by way of<br>
example.<br>

A set of 100 microphones were placed into a plasma chamber with<br>
a processing volume of - 300 litres. The chamber was connected<br>
to supplies of the required gases or vapours, via a mass flow<br>
controller and/or liquid mass flow meter and a mixing injector<br>
or any other vapour/gas introduction mechanism as appropriate.<br><br>
The chamber was evacuated to between 3 - 10 mtorr base pressure<br>
before allowing helium into the chamber at 20 sccm until a<br>
pressure of 80 mtorr was reached. A continuous power plasma<br>
was then struck for 4 minutes using RF at 13.56 MHz at 300 W.<br>
After this period, 1H,1H, 2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecylacylate (CAS<br>
# 27905-45-9) of formula<br><br>
was brought into the chamber at a rate of 120 milli grams per<br>
minute and the plasma switched to a pulsed plasma at 30 micro<br>
seconds on-time and 20 milli seconds off-time at a peak power<br>
of 100 W for 40 minutes. On completion of the 40 minutes the<br>
plasma power was turned off along with the processing gases and<br>
vapours and the chamber evacuated back down to base pressure.<br>
The chamber was then vented to atmospheric pressure and the<br>
microphone heads removed.<br>
It was found that the microphone heads were covered with an<br>
water and oil-repellent that protected it from challenge with<br>
water.<br><br>
