				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A POLYESTER Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a polyester. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a polyester from aromatic diiodide, an alkyl or aryl diol and carbon monoxide. More specifically, the invention relates to a process for preparing polyesters by contacting an aryl diiodide and an alkyl or aromatic diol with carbon monoxide in presence of a catalyst, the said catalyst then being recovered and recycled further. Background of the invention<br>
Polyesters constitute an important class of polymers with extensive commercial applications. The interests in polyesters as industrial material originates form their excellent heat resistance, high strength and high modulus. Generally, polyesters are prepared by;<br>
1.	Direct polyesterfication (e.g. Dicarboxylic acid + diol)<br>
2.	Ester exchange ( Dialkyl or diaryl ester +- diol)<br>
3.	Polycondensaition of acid chloride and a diol<br>
4.	Lactone ring opening polymerization.<br>
While, there are many other different methods for the polyester preparation, most of such conventional processes are characterized by difficulties in handling of unstable aromatic diacids or dichlorides, expensive starting materials and high reaction temperatures during their preparation.<br>
The prior art has shown, as exemplified by US Patent No. 4933419 and 4948864 that polyesters may be produced from aromatic diiodides or dibromides and diols by treatment with a carbon monoxide using a palladium catalyst This method of palladium-catalyzed carbonylation - polycondensation of aromatic dihalides and diol for the polyester manufacture based on Heck reaction, was originally developed by Emai and co-workers and subsequently by Perry and co-workers. The commonly employed solvent is monochlorobenzene. The resultant polyester is soluble in the reaction diluent and may be recovered by precipitating into methanol. Thus, all the reaction components including reacting monomers, catalyst and resultant polymer are soluble in the reaction medium. Until now, only homogeneous catalyst compositions have employed in such process. A particular disadvantage, which neglects the commercial use of such homogeneous catalysts, is the difficulties in the efficient separation, recovery and furl her recycling of the catalyst. The loss of the precious metal during frequent recovery cycles makes any such process uneconomical<br>
to operate and overshadows technologically attractive conversion rates obtained with homogeneous<br>
catalysts.<br>
Because of the commercial interest in olyesters, increasing academic as well as industrial attention<br>
has been paid towards research in developing new methods for their preparation. In view of the<br>
advantages and features of the present invention, the process of this invention would be a significant<br>
advance in the current state of the art related in the polyester synthesis.<br>
Polyesters constitute an important class of synthetic polymers and have enjoyed great amount of<br>
commercial as well as industrial interest because of their high performance properties like superior<br>
mechanical strength and heat resistance. Conventional methods of preparation for the polyesters are<br>
characterized by high temperatures and handling of unstable and expensive reactants like diacid<br>
chlorides and the like. Documented literature reveals that only homogeneous catalysts have been<br>
investigated so far. A particular disadvantage of the commercial use of such homogeneous catalysts,<br>
is the difficulty in the efficient separation, recovery and further recycling of the catalyst. The loss of<br>
the precious metal during frequent recovery cycles make s any such process uneconomical to operate<br>
and overshadows technologically attractive conversion rates obtained with homogeneous catalysts.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a process for polyester preparation with the provision for<br>
catalyst recovery.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a one step process for the preparation of polyesters<br>
utilizing a precious metal catalyst such a palladium catalyst, which is easily recoverable and reusable<br>
in the process.<br>

The present invention provides a catalytic method for the preparation of polyesters with provision for a catalyst separation, recovery and reuse. The catalyst being insoluble in the reaction diluent, can be easily separated since all other components including starting monomers, polyester product are soluble. The catalyst may be washed with suitable solvent like one used as reaction solvent, to ensure better removal of adhering product on it's surface. The catalyst may be used as recovered for the subsequent reaction or can be activated by typical activation methods like calcination etc. The polyester may be recovered by precipitation in methanol.<br>
