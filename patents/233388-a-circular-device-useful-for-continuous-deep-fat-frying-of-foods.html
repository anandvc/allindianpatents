				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a circular device useful for continuous deep fat frying of foods. The device of the present invention is particularly useful for deep fat frying of extruded products, boondi, papad, vada, poori and other similar traditional foods. The frying operation is done continuously using edible oil as the source of heat transfer medium. The product obtained by using this device are of uniform in color, texture and are obtained hygienically. The device of the present invention is therefore useful as a machine for continuous deep fat frying of extruded products, boondi, papad, vada, poori and other similar foods.<br>
The medium employed for continuous deep fat frying shall be any edible fat such as groundnut oil, mustard oil, coconut oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil, vanaspathi and also the combination of any of the above oils. Based on circular rotating hot trough and continuous conveyorised discharge mechanism, for continuous deep fat frying of products like sev, boondi, papad, vada, poori and other similar foods is proposed for the first time according to this invention.<br>
There is an appreciable growth in the Industries which manufacture ready to eat snack foods in both at the cottage and medium scale level. Continuous deep fat frying, as an important method of preparation of food around the world, different methods stand next to only cooking, baking and roasting. The process of deep fat frying is popular in India and around the world. There is a global demand for compact and versatile deep fat fryers. One of the main problems, is its huge size and the tedious operation involved in its operations.<br>
In large hotels, industrial canteens, hostels, and large / medium scale manufacturers of snack foods, several of the products like sev, boondi, papad,vada, poori and other similar foods are deep fat fryed and served to the consumers everyday. All the preparatory operations during deep fat frying are carried out<br>
manually. There is no attempt to produce and market compact continuous circular deep fat fryers for preparation of sev, boondi, papad, vada, poori and other similar foods, are being made by industries. The medium / small scale producers of deep fat fryed products are deprived of a suitable machine for preparation of deep fat fryed products..<br>
In case a compact device is made available for various operations involved in continuous deep fat frying of extruded products, boondi, papad, vada, poori and other similar foods would result in reduction in labour and drudgery on the part of chefs, help in hygienic operations, and enhance uniformity in quality and quantities. It would pave way for the medium / small scale production of deep fat fryed food in hotels, industrial canteens, hostels and other mass production centers.<br>
Hitherto the process of deep fat frying is done manually by using either stainless steel or mild steel pans and the discharge of the fryed product and draining of oil is done by using a perforated spatula. For this purpose, a device as shown in fig 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification is being currently used. In manual deep fat frying and discharging, the device consists of a pan (B) arid a perforated spatulla for discharging and draining of the deepfat fryed product / oil (A). The pan is heated by a stove or an electric heater (C). The product is turned and discharged by the perforated sparulla for uniform frying. The temperature of the oil is maintained by the experience of the chef by varying the supply of heat to the pan. Heating of oil is done by commonly used fuels such as, by burning kerosene, LPG, firewood, coal or by using electricity. The fryed products are removed from the pan with the help of a perforated spatula. All these steps are done manually. The manual deep fat frying of snack foods has the following drawbacks.<br>
&gt;	The temperature of the frying medium i.e. the edible oil is monitored by the<br>
experience of the operator / chef.<br>
&gt;	By this process, it is very difficult to achieve a uniform colour of the product and<br>
the colour varies from batch to batch. Even in single batch there is variation in<br>
colour from point to point.<br>
&gt;	The process is labour intensive and manual drudgery is very high which would<br>
reduce the efficiency of the operator.<br>
&gt;	The cooking time of the product will vary from batch to batch and will be at the<br>
discretion of the chef.<br>
&gt;	The process of deep fat frying is done in batches.<br>
&gt;	The production rates are very low.<br>
Batch type deep fat fryers are also available, where in the unit in provided with compartments for heating of edible oil, as show in fig 2. The batch type fryer is provided with perforated basket / baskets (b), which fits in to the frying compartments (c) and is useful for discharging and draining of the product (a) and the edible oil. All the contact parts of the fryer are made of stainless steel. Oil is heated by fuels such as LPG and electricity (d). The units will have castors wheels (e) for easy movement. The draw backs of the above type fryer are<br>
&gt;	High initial investment.<br>
&gt;	The unit is uneconomical for medium and small-scale manufacturers.<br>
&gt;	Production rates are low.<br>
&gt;	It needs a skilled operator / chef.<br>
&gt;	Units are suitable for batch operations.<br>
Deep fat fryers of longitudinal construction are available in the country. They occupy a large amount of space of the plant. They are built with a conveyorised belt dipped in<br>
the hot oil bath, where the material is moved from one end of the fryer to the other end. The residence time of deep fat frying can be varied depending on the material to be deep fat fryed and also the capacity of the unit. Oil is heated by fuels such as LPG and electricity. The major drawbacks of the above machine are:<br>
&gt;	The input and discharge of the fryed product are very much apart.<br>
&gt;	They occupy a large plinth area of the plant.<br>
&gt;	The units are labor intensive and need attention of more operators.<br>
&gt;	High initial investment.<br>
&gt;	They are very difficult to move from place to place.<br>
&gt;	It needs a skilled operator to operate the machine.<br>
Reference may be made to the following patents filed in United States patents. A frying pan has a bottom surface with an outwardly protruding central, planer and circular masses area, which is made for contact with an electrically heated plate. There is also a wing-shaped bottom portion on each side of the contact area. The wing-shaped portions have a periphery, which account for 30-80% of the total periphery of the frying pan bottom.
