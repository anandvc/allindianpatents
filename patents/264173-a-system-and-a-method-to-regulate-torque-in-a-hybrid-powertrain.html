A TORQUE SPLIT STRATEGY FOR A<br>
BELT ALTERNATOR STARTER (BAS) HYBRID<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/921,799, filed on April 4, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
The present disclosure relates to a hybrid powertrain of a<br>
vehicle, and more specifically to a torque split strategy for a hybrid powertrain.<br>
BACKGROUND The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
 Hybrid powertrains typically include a first torque generator,<br>
such as an internal combustion engine (ICE), and a second torque generator,<br>
such as an electric machine (EM), each providing torque to a driveline to propel a<br>
vehicle. In a full hybrid powertrain, the EM drives the driveline directly without<br>
transferring torque through a component of the ICE. In a mild hybrid powertrain,<br>
the EM is typically coupled with the ICE through an accessory drive such that<br>
torque generated by the EM is transferred to the driveline through the ICE. An<br>
exemplary mild hybrid powertrain includes a belt alternator starter (BAS) system.<br><br>
In the BAS system, the EM is coupled to the ICE via a traditional belt and pulley<br>
configuration that drives vehicle accessories such as pumps and compressors.<br>
 Powertrain torque control typically includes axle torque and<br>
propulsion torque control domains. In the mild hybrid powertrain, the propulsion<br>
torque is the output torque at the crankshaft of the ICE. This output torque<br>
includes the EM torque contribution.<br>
 Powertrain torque control typically monitors and adjusts<br>
predicted torque and immediate torque. Predicted torque is a slow changing set<br>
point of the system. For example, a typical predicted torque request may include<br>
driver input. In a spark ignited system, the predicted torque value controls the<br>
airflow. In diesel or electric systems, the predicted torque value is shaped to<br>
establish a normal operating point of the system according to driver preference.<br>
Conversely, immediate torque is a fast changing set point of the powertrain<br>
system. Immediate torque is only active when a torque intervention is active. In<br>
a spark ignited system, the immediate torque value controls the spark and fuel.<br>
In a diesel or electric system, the immediate torque value controls the actual<br>
torque produced by the system.<br>
Mild hybrid powertrain control typically provides an EM torque<br>
command while commanding the ICE torque actuators directly. Mild hybrid<br>
powertrain control typically does not dynamically compensate the EM torque<br>
command to account for a delay in the ICE torque response. Thus, a propulsion<br>
torque output may undershoot or overshoot the propulsion torque request.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
Accordingly, the present disclosure includes a torque control system that<br>
may split a propulsion torque command into an internal combustion engine (ICE)<br>
torque command and an electric machine (EM) torque command. The torque<br>
control system may include a first module that determines an ICE torque<br>
command and an EM torque command based on a propulsion torque request.<br>
The torque control system may also include a second module that delays the EM<br>
torque command based on a dynamic torque response of the ICE.<br>
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no. way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Inputs from a driver and/or a cruise control system (i.e., true<br>
torque requests) reflect an amount of torque desired. All other torque modifiers<br><br>
including, but not limited to, traction control, stability control, engine overspeed<br>
protection, transmission torque limiting and the like, are typically considered<br>
torque interventions. These torque interventions are in either an active or<br>
inactive state. When all of the torque interventions are either inactive or apply a<br>
limit that does not ultimately limit a torque request, the torque request will pass<br>
through unchanged. For purposes of clarity, the term torque request is used<br>
herein for both true torque requests and torque interventions.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary hybrid powertrain 10 is<br>
shown. Although the powertrain 10 is illustrated as a rear wheel drive (RWD)<br>
powertrain, it is appreciated that the torque control system of the present disclosure can be implemented with any other powertrain configuration. The<br>
powertrain 10 includes a propulsion system 12 and a driveline system 14. The<br>
propulsion system 12 includes an internal combustion engine (ICE) 16 and an<br>
electric machine'(EM) 18. The propulsion system may also include one or more<br>
auxiliary components 20 including, but not limited to, an A/C compressor. The<br>
EM 18 and the auxiliary components 20 are drivingly coupled to the ICE 16 using<br>
abelt and pulley system 22. The belt and pulley system 22 includes a plurality of<br>
pulleys that are fixed for rotation with the EM 18, the auxiliary components 20,<br>
and the crankshaft 24 of the ICE 16, as well as a belt to enable torque to be<br>
transferred to/from the crankshaft 24 from/to the EM 18 and/or the auxiliary<br>
components 20. This configuration is referred to as a belt alternator starter<br>
(BAS) system.<br><br>
 The crankshaft 24 of the ICE 16 drives the driveline system 14.<br>
The driveline system 14 includes a flexplate or flywheel (not shown), a torque<br>
converter or other coupling device 26, a transmission 28, a propeller shaft 30, a<br>
differential 32, axle shafts 34, brakes 36. and driven wheels 38. A propulsion<br>
torque (TPROp) that is output at the crankshaft 24 of the ICE 16 is transferred<br>
through the driveline system 14 to provide an axle torque (TAXLE) at the axle<br>
shafts 34 to drive the wheels 38. More specifically, TPROp is multiplied by several<br>
gear ratios provided by the coupling device 26, the transmission 28 and the<br>
differential 32 to provide TAXLE at the axle shafts 34. TPROP is multiplied by an<br>
effective gear ratio, which is a function of the ratio introduced by the.coupling<br>
device 26, the transmission gear ratio determined by transmission input/output<br>
shaft "speeds, the differential ratio, as well as any other component that may<br>
introduce a ratio in the driveline system 14 (e.g., a transfer case in a four wheel<br>
drive (4WD) or all wheel drive (AWD) powertrain).<br>
 A control module 40 regulates operation of the powertrain 10<br>
based on the torque control system of the present disclosure. A driver input 42<br>
communicates with the control module 40. The driver input 42 can include, but is<br>
not limited to, an accelerator pedal 44 and/or a cruise control system 46.. A driver<br>
interface 48 also communicates with the control module 40. The driver interface<br>
48 includes, but is not limited to, a transmission range selector 50.<br>
 The control module 40 may rely on the EM 18 rather than the<br>
ICE 1.6 for torque contribution to improve fuel economy, or use the EM 18 in<br>
addition to the ICE 16 to provide an acceleration boost. In addition, the control<br><br>
module 40 may shut off the fuel supply to ICE 16 during a stopping event to<br>
improve fuel economy and use the EM 18 to restart the ICE 16 quickly. The<br>
control module 40 uses inputs from a propulsion torque arbitration ring (PTAR)<br>
and an opportunity charge discharge ring (OCDR) to determine an ICE torque<br>
command and an EM torque command (TEM). The PTAR and the OCDR may<br>
reside in the control module 40 or in-a separate module. Inputs from the PTAR<br>
include a predicted propulsion torque request {TSLOW_PROP), an immediate<br>
propulsion torque request <tfastj a minimum engine off torque></tfastj>
vehicle coast torque (TCOAST): a minimum engine run torque (TMIN_RUN), and a<br>
maximum ICE torque (TMAXJCE)-<br>
 The PTAR may include coast regeneration logic that sets<br>
TSLOW_PROP 'ess than TMIN_RUN and TCOAST during a coasting event to capture<br>
energy input into the hybrid powertrain 10 through the wheels 38. The PTAR<br>
may also include brake regeneration-logic that sets TFAST_PROP less than TM|N_0FF<br>
during a braking event to capture energy input into the hybrid powertrain 10<br>
through the wheels 38. Inputs from the OCDR include a charge torque request<br>
(TCHARGE) and a negative charge or discharge torque request (TD|SCHARGE)- The<br>
ICE torque command includes an immediate ICE torque command (TFASTJCE)<br>
and a predicted ICE torque command (TSLOWJCE)- TEM includes a predicted EM<br>
torque command (TSLOW_EM) unless TFAST_PROP is active, in which case TEM<br>
includes an immediate EM torque command (TFAST_EM).<br>
The control module 40 provides TEM to the EM 18 and TFASTJCE<br>
and TSLOWJCE to the ICE 16. TEM controls the torque output of the EM 18. When<br><br>
TFAST_PROP is active, TSLOW_ICE controls the airflow in the ICE 16 while TFASTJCE<br>
controls the spark and fuel in the ICE 16. When TFAST_PROP is not active,<br>
TSLOWJCE controls the airflow, spark, and fuel in the ICE 16. The airflow, spark,<br>
and fuel in the ICE 16 govern the torque output of the ICE 16. Thus, the<br>
propulsion torque output is controlled by TEM, TFASTJCE. and TSLOWJCE- The<br>
control module 40 coordinates the EM torque response and the ICE torque<br>
response so that as one is decreased, the other is increased at the proper rate to<br>
ensure the propulsion torque output does not undershoot or overshoot the<br>
propulsion torque request.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 2, a torque split control module 100<br>
receives inputs from the PTAR and the OCDR, including TSI_OW_PROP and<br>
TFAST_PROP- The torque split control module 100 determines TSLOWJCE and<br>
TSLOW_EM based on TSLOW_PROP- The torque split control module 100 provides<br>
TSLOW_EM to an EM delay module 102. The EM delay module 102 calculates a<br>
final EM torque command (TSLOW_EM_FINAL) based on TSLOW_EM and a dynamic<br>
torque output-response of the ICE 16. The EM delay module 102 provides<br>
TSLOW_EM^FINAL to the torque split control module 100. The torque split control<br>
module 100 determines TEM and TFASTJCE based on TFAST_PROP when TFAST_PROP<br>
is active. Otherwise, the torque split control module 100 determines TEM based<br>
on TSLOW_EM_FINAL and sets TFASTJCE to inactive. The torque split control module<br>
100 outputs TSLOWJCE. TFASTJCE. and TEM. .<br>
 In other words, the torque split control module 100 splits<br>
propulsion torque requests into ICE and EM torque commands. The torque split<br><br>
control module 100 determines predicted ICE and EM torque commands based<br>
on the predicted propulsion torque request. The EM delay module 102 delays<br>
the predicted EM torque command to match the dynamic torque output response<br>
of the ICE 16. When the immediate propulsion torque request is active, the<br>
torque split control module 100 determines the EM torque command and the<br>
immediate ICE torque command based thereon. Otherwise, the torque split<br>
control module 100 determines the EM torque command based on the delayed or<br>
final predicted EM torque command and sets the immediate ICE torque<br>
command to inactive.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 3, the torque split control module 100<br>
receives inputs from the PTAR, including TSLOW_PROP. TFAST_PROP, TMIN_OFF,<br>
TCOAST, TMIN_RUN, and TMAXJCE. and inputs from the OCDR, including TCHARGE and<br>
TDISCHARGE. The torque split control module 100 includes a coast regeneration<br>
module 204, an EM boost module 206, and a predicted torque intervention<br>
module 208. When TSLOW_PROP is less than TMIN_OFF and the greater of TMIN_RUNand TCOAST, the coast regeneration module 204 determines TSLOWJCE based on TMIN_OFF or TM|N_RUN and determines TSLOW_EM- based on TSLOWJCE and either<br>
TSLOW_PROP or the EM torque capacity. When TSLOW_PROP is not less than TM|N_0FF<br>
and the greater of TMIN_RUN and TC0AST. and TSLOW_PROP is greater than TMAXJCE.<br>
the EM boost module 206 determines TSLOWJCE based on TMAXJCE and<br>
determines TSLOWJSM based on TSLOWJCE and either TSLOW_PROP or the EM torque<br>
capacity. When TSLOW_PROP is not less than TMIN_OFF and the greater of TMIN_RUN<br>
and TCOAST, and TSLOW_PROP not greater than TMAXJCE, the predicted torque<br><br>
intervention module 208 determines TSLOW_ICE and TSLOW_EM based on TSLOW_PROP<br>
and either TCHARGE or an EM torque capacity. The predicted torque intervention<br>
module 208 provides TSLOW_EM at a current iteration k (TSi_ow_EM(k)) to the EM<br>
delay module 102. <br>
 The EM delay module 102 includes buffer modules 210, 214,<br>
gain modules 212, 216, and a summer 218. The buffer 210 outputs TSLOWJ=M at<br>
an iteration k-d (TSi_owjEM(k-d)) to the gain module 212. When TSLow_EM(k-d)<br>
does not exist, the buffer 210 sets TSLow_EM(k-d) equal to 0. The gain module 212<br>
multiplies Tsi_ow_EM(k-d) by a gain a and outputs the product (a TSi_ow_EM(k-d)) to<br>
the summer 218. The buffer 214 outputs TSLOW. .EM_FINAL at an iteration k-1<br>
(TSLow_EivLFiNAL(k-1)) to the gain module 216. When TSLow_EMj=iNAL(k-1) does not<br>
exist, the buffer 214 sets TSLOw_EM_FiNAi(k-1) equal to 0. The gain module 216<br>
multiplies TSi_ow_EM(k-d) by a gain 1-a and outputs the product ((1-cr)TSL.ow„EM(k-<br>
1)) to the summer 218. The summer 218 outputs TSLOW_EM_FINAL at an iteration k<br>
(TsLOw_EM_FiNAL(k)) to the buffer 214 and the torque split control module 100.<br>
 The torque split control module 100 also includes an immediate<br>
torque intervention module 220. When TFAST_PROP is active, the immediate torque<br>
intervention module 220 determines TEM and TFASTJCE based on TFAST PROP-<br>
Otherwise, the torque split control module 100 determines TEM based on<br>
TSLOW_EM_FINAL and sets TFASTJCE to inactive. The torque split control module 100<br>
outputs TSLOWJCE, TFASTJCE, and TEM.<br>
 In other words, torque split control module 100 determines<br>
whether the ICE 16 is being fueled, whether coast regeneration is requested,<br><br>
whether the maximum ICE torque capacity is exceeded, and whether the<br>
immediate propulsion torque request is active, and splits propulsion torque<br>
requests into ICE and EM torque commands accordingly. When the ICE 16 is<br>
not being fueled, the coast regeneration module 204 determines the predicted<br>
ICE torque command based on the minimum non-fueled ICE torque request and<br>
determines the predicted EM torque command based on the difference between<br>
the predicted propulsion torque request and the predicted ICE torque command.<br>
When the ICE 16 is being fueled and coast regeneration is requested, the coast<br>
regeneration module 204 determines the predicted ICE torque command based<br>
on the minimum fueled ICE torque request and determines the predicted EM<br>
torque command based on the difference between the predicted propulsion<br>
torque request and the predicted ICE'torque command.<br>
 When the ICE 16 is being fueled and the predicted propulsion<br>
torque request exceeds the maximum ICE torque capacity, the EM boost module<br>
206 determines the predicted ICE torque command based on the maximum ICE<br>
torque capacity, determines the predicted EM torque command based on the<br>
difference between the predicted propulsion torque request and the ICE torque<br>
command, and limits the predicted EM torque command within the EM torque<br>
capacity. When the ICE 16 is being fueled and the predicted propulsion torque<br>
request does not exceed the maximum ICE torque capacity, the predicted torque<br>
intervention module 208 determines the predicted EM torque command based on<br>
the predicted propulsion torque request, limits the predicted EM torque command<br>
within the EM torque capacity, and determines" the predicted ICE torque<br><br>
command based on the difference between the predicted propulsion torque<br>
request and the predicted EM torque command.<br>
 When the immediate propulsion torque request is active, the<br>
immediate torque intervention module 220 determines the EM torque command<br>
based thereon, limits the EM torque command within the EM torque capacity,<br>
and determines the immediate ICE torque command based.on the difference<br>
between the immediate propulsion torque request and the EM torque command.<br>
Otherwise, the immediate torque intervention module 220 determines the EM<br>
torque command based on the predicted EM torque command and sets the<br>
immediate ICE torque command to inactive.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 4, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
torque control system according to the principle of the present disclosure will be<br>
described in detail. In steps 300 and 302, control determines TSLOWJCE and<br>
TSLOW.EM, respectively, based on TSLOW_PROP- In step 304, control calculates<br>
TSLOW_EM_FINAL based on TSLOW_EM and the dynamic torque output response of the<br>
ICE 16 from FIG. 1. Control may predict the dynamic torque output response of<br>
the ICE 16 and adjust TSLOW_EM to obtain TSLOW_EM_FINAL using a mathematical<br>
model such as a first order response function that incorporates a delay. In step<br>
306, control determines whether TFAST_PROP is active. When TFAST_PROP is active,<br>
control determines TEM based on TFAST_PROP in steps 308, and then determines<br>
TFASTJCE based on TFAST_PROP and TEM in steps 310. If TFAST_PROP is not active,<br>
control determines TEM based on TSLOWJ=M_FINAL in step 312 and sets TFASTJCE to<br>
inactive in step 314.<br><br>
 Referring now to FIG. 5, an alternate embodiment of exemplary<br>
steps executed by the torque control system according to the principles of the<br>
present disclosure will be described in detail. In step 400, control determines if<br>
TSLOW„PROP is less than TMIN_OFF- When TSLOW_PROP is 'ess than TMINJDFF, control<br>
sets TSLOWJCE equal to TMIN_OFF in step 402, sets TSI_OW_EM equal to the difference<br>
between TSLOW_PROP and TSLOWJCE in step 404 and limits TSLOW_EM between a<br>
minimum EM torque (TMIN_EM) and a maximum EM torque (TMAX_EM) in step 406.<br>
When TSLOW_PROP is not less than TMIN _OFF. control sets a minimum vehicle coast<br>
torque (TM|N_COAST) equal to the greater of TMIN_RUN and TCOAST in step 408 and<br>
determines whether TSLOW_PROP is less than TMIN_COAST in step 410. When<br>
TSLOW_PROP is less than TMIN_COAST, control sets TSLOWJCE equal to TMIN_RUN in step<br>
412, sets TSLOW_EM equal to the difference between TSLOW_PROP and TSLOWJCE in<br>
step 404, and limits TSLOWJ=M between TMIN_EM and TMAX_EM in step 406.<br>
When TSLOW_PROP is not less than TMIN_ .COAST, control determines<br>
whether TSLOW_PROP is greater than TMAXJCE in step 414. When TSLOW_PROP is<br>
greater than TMAXJCE. control sets TSLOWJCE equal to TMAXJCE and sets TSLOWJEM<br>
equal to the difference between TSLOWJ=ROP and TMAXJCE in step 416 and limits<br>
TSLOWJEM between a TMIN_EM and TMAXJHM in step 418.<br>
 When TSLOW_PROP is not greater than TMAXJCE, control<br>
determines when the source of TSLOW_PROP is the transmission 28 in step 420.,<br>
When the source of TSLOW_PROP is the transmission 28, control sets TSLOW_EM<br>
equal to TSLOW_PROP in step 422, limits TSLOW_EM between TMIN_EM and TMAX_EM in<br>
step 424, and sets TSLOWJCE equal to the difference between TSLow _PROP and<br><br>
TSLOW_EM in step 426. When the source of TSLOW_PROP is not the transmission 28,<br>
control sets TSI_OW_EM equal to TCHARGE in step 428, limits TSLOW_EM between<br>
TMIN_EM and TMAX_EM in step 430, and sets TSLOWJCE equal to the difference<br>
between TSLOW_PROP and TSLOW^EM in step 432.<br>
In step 434, control calculates TSLOW_EM_FINAL based on TSLOW_EM<br>
and the dynamic torque output response of the ICE 16. As mentioned earlier,<br>
control may predict the dynamic torque output response of the ICE 16 and adjust<br>
TSLOW_EM to obtain TSLOW_EM_FINAL using a mathematical model such as a first<br>
order response function that incorporates a delay. Up to this point in the<br>
discussion of FIG. 5, control has determined all torque values for the current<br>
iteration k. In step 434, control uses torque values determined at prior iterations<br>
to match the dynamic response of the ICE 16. Thus, in step 434, control<br>
calculates Tsi_ow_EM_FiNAL(k) by subtracting the product of the gain 1-o and<br>
TsLow_EM_FiNAi_(k-1) from the product of the gain a and TSi_ow_EM(k-d). When<br>
TsLOw_EM_FiNAL(k-1) or TSi.ow_EM(k-d) do not exist, control sets the value the<br>
nonexistent torque equal to 0.<br>
In step 436, control determines whether TFAST_PROP is active.<br>
When TFAST_PROP is active, control sets TFAST_EM equal to TFAST_PROP in step 438,<br>
limits TFAST_EM between TMIN_EM and TMAX_EM in step 440, and sets TEM and<br>
TFASTJCE equal to TFAST_EM and the difference between TFAST_PROP and TEM ,<br>
respectively, in step 442. When TFAST_PROP is not active, control sets TEM equal to<br>
TSLOW_EM_FINAL in step 444 and sets TFASTJCE to inactive in step 446.<br><br>
 Referring now to FIG. 6, exemplary propulsion and charge<br>
torque requests, corresponding torque commands, and the resulting propulsion<br>
torque output will be described in' detail. The vertical axes represent the<br>
magnitude of a torque signal at a time represented by the horizontal axes.<br>
Control receives the propulsion torque request and the discharge torque request<br>
shown in graphs 500 and 502, respectively, and outputs the ICE and EM torque<br>
commands shown in graphs 504 and 508, respectively. Graph 506 shows the<br>
ICE torque output resulting from the ICE torque command in graph 504, and<br>
graph 510 shows the propulsion torque output. Control decreases the ICE<br>
torque command before time 3 to track the decreasing propulsion torque request.<br>
Control also decreases the EM torque command before time 3 to compensate for<br>
the delay between the ICE torque command and the ICE torque output, and<br>
continues to decrease the EM torque command until it is equal to the charge<br>
torque request. At time 3, control increases the ICE torque command such that<br>
the propulsion torque output satisfies the propulsion torque request.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 7, exemplary propulsion and discharge<br>
torque requests, corresponding torque commands, and the resulting propulsion<br>
torque output will be described in detail. As in FIG. 6, the vertical axes represent<br>
the magnitude of a torque signal at a time represented by the horizontal axes.<br>
Control receives the propulsion torque request and the charge torque request<br>
shown in graphs 600 and 602, respectively, and outputs the ICE and EM torque<br>
commands shown in graphs 604 and 608, respectively. Graph 606 shows the<br>
ICE torque output resulting from the ICE torque command in graph 604, and<br><br>
graph 610 shows the propulsion torque output. Control increases the ICE torque<br>
command before time 3 to track the increasing propulsion torque request.<br>
Control also increases the EM torque command before time 3 to compensate for<br>
the delay between the ICE torque command and the ICE torque output, and<br>
continues to increase the EM torque command until it is equal to the discharge<br>
torque request. At time 3, control decreases the ICE torque command such that<br>
the propulsion torque output satisfies propulsion torque request.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 8, exemplary predicted and immediate<br>
torque requests and corresponding torque commands will be described in detail.<br>
The vertical axis represents the magnitude of a torque signal at a time<br>
represented by the horizontal axis. Signal 700 represents a predicted propulsion<br>
torque request provided by the PTAR as a result of driver input. Signal 702<br>
represents a predicted propulsion torque request provided by the PTAR as a<br>
result of coast regeneration logic. Signal 704 represents an immediate<br>
propulsion torque request provided by the PTAR as a result of brake<br>
regeneration logic. Signal 706 is an array of the predicted and immediate torque<br>
requests provided by the PTAR, which.includes signals 700, 702, and 704.<br>
Signal 708 represents a sum of the predicted torque requests provided by the<br>
PTAR, and signal 710 represents a sum of the immediate torque requests<br>
provided by the PTAR. Signal 712 represents the EM torque command. Control<br>
sets the ICE torque command equal to a sum of the predicted torque requests<br>
provided by the PTAR and sets the EM torque command equal to the difference<br>
between the propulsion torque request and the ICE torque response.<br><br>
