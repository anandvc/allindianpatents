Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an improvement in paper products having an aqueous based ink<br>
jet coating applied to its surface. The improvement generally resides in the incorporation of an a<br>
primary amine functional polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH PVNH2) as a polymeric binder in the ink jet<br>
coating. One form of an amine functional polyvinyl alcohol is produced by the hydrolysis of a<br>
copoiymer of vinyl acetate and N-vinylfotmamide (PVOH PVNH2). another formed by the<br>
polymerization of vinyl acetate and ailyl amine. and another is the 4-aminobutyral derivative of<br>
polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
Several advantages are associated with the paper products incorporating the improved ink<br>
jet coating. These advantages include:<br>
the incorporation of a primary amine functional poiyvinyl alcohol as a<br>
polymer binder in the ink jet coating eases the makedown procedure of the coating<br>
formulation by eliminating the need to add canonic materials:<br>

excellent lightlaslncss of the inks:<br>
the addition of a pnmary amine functional polyvinyl alcohol prnvides for<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to improvements in paper products preferentially suited for use<br>
with ink jet printers. The key to the preparation of improved paper products for ink jet printing<br>
is in the ink jet coating applied to the surface of the paper. In particular, the improvement<br>
resides in the incorporation of an amine functional polyvinyl alcohol polymer as a binder for the<br>
ink jet coating.<br>
Amine functional polyvinyl alcohols are knowr. and representative examples of such<br>
amine functional polyvinyl alcohols are set forth in Rabeson et al. US Patent 5380.403 and are<br>
incorporated by reference. For purposes of completeness and expanding upon the general<br>
teachings of Robeson el al. methods for preparing amine functional polyl vinyl alcohols) include<br>
copoiymerization of vinyl acetate with an N-vinyiamide. e.g.. N-vinylformamide or N-vinyi<br>
aceiamide. or copoiymerization with allyl amine followed by hydrolysis, or by polymerization of<br>
vinvl acetate followed by hydrolysis to form the poiyvinyl alcohol derivative and then by<br>
reaction with 4-amino butyraldehyde dimethyl acetal. Other routes may be used to generate the<br>
same or similar types of amine functional polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
The syntnesis of the precursor vinyl acetate copoiymer can be conducted in solution.<br>
slurry suspension or emulsion type polymerizations. Roarignez. in "Principles of Polymer<br>
Svstems. P 98-101. 403. 405 ( McGraw-Hill. NY. 1970) describes bulk and solution<br>
poivmerization and the specifics of emulsion polymerization. When preparing poly (vinyl<br>
acetate ) by suspension polymerization for example, the monomer is typically" dispersed in wa:er<br>
contalning a suspending agent such as polyvinl alcohol and then an initiator such as perovde<br>
is added. The unreaeied monomer is removed and the polymer Tillered and dried. A preferred<br>
route involves polymerization of vinyl acetate and N-vinyl formamide in methanol which results<br>
in a "paste" like product which is amenable to hydrolysis.<br>
A variety of comonomers. e.g.. ethylenically unsaturated monomers. may be<br>
copolymerized with vinyl acetate and or vinyl acetate and N-vinyl formamide or allyl<br>
amine to produce amine functional polyvinyl alcohols eopolymers. Representative, but not<br>
totally inclusive. ethylenicaly unsaturated monomers include C,-C, esters 0f acrylic acid and<br>
methacrylic acid, unsaturated carboxvlic acids, and hydrocarbon monomers. Examples of esters<br>
include metbyl methacrylate. ethyl acrylate. butyl acrylate. and 2-ethy lhexyl acrylate. Others<br>
include hydroxy esters such as bydroxyethyl acrylate. The monomers typically are used at levels<br>
of about 10 mole percent and preferably less than about 5% by weight.<br>
A preferred copolymer for use as a binder in ink jet coating formulations consists<br>
essentially of vinyl acetate and N-vinyl formamide eopolymers containing from about 70 to 99<br>
mole percent vinyl acetate and from about 1 to 30 mole percent N-vinyl formamide.<br>
Reaction temperatures for forming eopolymers of vim 1 acetate and N-vinyl formamide<br>
and ally] amine are conventional. The reaction temperature can be controlled by the rate of<br>
catalyst addition and by the rate of the heat dissipation therefrom. Generally, it is advantageous<br>
to maintain a temperature from about 500 to 7O0C and to a\oid temperatures in excess of about<br>
S00C. While temperatures as low as 00 can be used, economically. the lower temperature limit<br>
is about 400C.<br>
The reaction time will also vary depending upon other variables such as the temperature,<br>
the catalyst, and the desired extent of the polymerization. It is generally desirable to continue the<br>
reaction until less than about 0.5% of the N-vinylformamide. aliyl amine or vinvl acetate, if<br>
emploved. remains unreacted. Under these circumstances, a reaction time of about 6 hours has<br>
been found to be generally sufficient for complete polymerization, but reaction times ranging<br>
from about 3 to 10 hours have been used, and other reaction times can be employed, if desired.<br>
The hydrolysis of the vinyl acetate copolymers of this invention can be accomplished<br>
using methods typically utilized for poly (vinyl alcohol). Either acid or base hvdroivsis or<br>
combinations thereof can be conducted to yield the amine functional poiy( vinyl alcohols) of this<br>
invention. The hydrolysis often is conducted in several steps: the first step involving contacting<br>
with a catalvtic amount of base (e.g. K.OH. NaOH) which results in the hydrolysis of vinyl<br>
acetate groups. Hydrolysis o! the vinyl amide groups can be accomplishment by higher levels of<br>
base or hy acid addition followed by proper time""temperature to yield the desired level of<br>
hydrolysis. In the case of acid hydrolysis, the amine group is prolonated to yield a positive<br>
charge neutralized wiih an anionic group (e.g. CT. Br". HSO1. H2PO2. and the like). Both the<br>
amine (-NH2 or protorated versions (NH2 X) are suitable in this invention. Acids suitable for<br>
effecting hydrolysis include mineral acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric. nitric, phosphoric and<br>
other mineral acids commonly used, as well as organic acids such as para-toluene sulfonic acid,<br>
methnnesulfonic acid, oxalic acid and the like. Acidic salts comprised of weak bases and stronu<br>
acids, e.g.. ammonium bisulfate. alkyl ammonium bisuifates such as tetrabutylammonium<br>
bisulfate can be used. For further detail. the hydrolysis of poly (vinyl alcohol) and copolymers is<br>
described in the book "Poly(vinyl alcohol): Properties and Applications", ed. by C.A. Finch.<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. 1973. p. 91-120. and "Poly(vinyl alcohol) Fibers" ed. by l.<br>
Sokuruda. Marcel Dekker. Inc.. New York. 1985. p. 57-68. A recent review- of poly(vinyl<br>
alcohol) was given by F. L. Marten in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering.<br>
2nd ed.. Vol. 1 7. p. 167. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. 1989. Both references are incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
Another potential route for achieving amine functional poly(vinyl alcohols) for use in<br>
preparing the ink jet coatings, as noted supra, involves the reaction of specific blocked alkyl<br>
amine aldehydes with polyvinyl aicohol or polyvinyl alcohol copolymers to produce ammo<br>
functional poiwinvl alcohols. Blocked alky 1 aldehydes include 4-amino butyral dimethyl acetal<br>
and ether aikyl acetals which react with polyvinyl to produce the 4-amino alkylal of<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, e.g.. the 4-aminobutryral of polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
The incorporation of primary amine functionality in the amine functional polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, e.g.. hvdrolvzed vinyl acetate N-vinylfom amide or hydrolyzed vinyl acetate allyl amine<br>
copolvmers or polyvml alcohol aminobutyral polymers is within the range of from about 1 to<br>
amounts of up to about 30. preferablv about 5 to 20 mole%. The desired level of vinyl acetate<br>
conversion to vinyl alcohol is from about 75 to 100%. preferably from about SO to 99%<br>
hvdrolvsis ana the level of vinylarnide conversion to vinylamine is from about 25 to fully<br>
hvdrolvzed. e.g.. about 100%.. In some preferred embodiments the hydroiyzed vinyl acetate is<br>
present in an amount of from about SO to 95 moie percent.<br>
The following sets forth operati\e and preferred ranges regarding the use of an amine<br>
functional polyvinvl alcohol. It is understood that the values identnied are "about" or<br>
approximate ranges.<br>
Operative and Preferred Ranges of the Composition:<br>
Primary Amine functional PVOH<br>
Molecular weight (wt. average)<br>
Primary Amine Content<br>
Acetate Hydrolysis<br>
wt. % binder in ink jet coating<br>
Coaling pH<br>
Ink Jet coating formulations typically incorporate silica pigment and possibly a small<br>
amount of another mineral pigment in the formulation. Typically, the mineral pigment is silica<br>
and is incorporated in the ink jet coating formulation in amounts which range from about I to<br>
90%. preferably about 30 to 85%. by weight. The level of binder (solids basis) will range within<br>
conventional levels or about 20 to 80% by weight of the ink jet formulation. The levels of<br>
pigment and binder depend significantly upon the type of coater used in the preparation of the<br>
ink jet paper. Synthetic aluminum silicates having surface areas of about 100 nr per gram as<br>
well as clay. talc, calcium carbonate, magnesium silicate and the like have been used as fillers m<br>
ink jet coating compositions and can be used. the preferred filler for ink jet coating<br>
compositions is silica having a surface area of about 50 to 700 nr gram. Ink iet formulations<br>
may also contain conventional additives such as defoamers. surface acme agents, dyes,<br>
ultraviolet absorbents, pigment dispersants. moid inhibitors, thickeners and water-resisting<br>
agents.<br>
The ink jet formulation usually is applied to the paper surface in amounts ranging from<br>
about 2 to 20 grams per nr . Coat weight is somewhat dependent upon the type of coating<br>
applicator. The ink iet coating incorporating the amine functional poiyvinyl alcohol is supplied<br>
to the paper surface itself rather than to paper stock prior to sheet formation.<br>
Not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed the amine group in the amine<br>
functional polymers provides a cationic charge on the paper surface which reacts with the<br>
anlonio sulfonie acid groups of the direct or acid dye of the ink jet inks to form an insoiuble sail.<br>
By forming an insoluble salt, the inks become waterast on the paper surface and the<br>
ligitfastness is improved in those paper products incorporating the amine functional polyvinyl<br>
alcohol as compared to ink iet coatings incorporating poly(vinyl alcohol) nomopol"ymer as the<br>
binder. Pigment binding strength, and silica pigmem binding strength in particular, is improved<br>
with the use of the ink jet coatings incorporating the amine functional poiy(vinyl alcohol)<br>
polymers in comparison to the ink jet coalings incorporating the po!y(vinyl alcohol)<br>
homopolymer due to the strong absorption of the amines with the silanol group on the silica<br>
pigment.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the preparation of suitable aminc<br>
functional polyvinyl alcohols and to illustrate ink jet coating systems for paper.<br>

formulated with 100 parts precipitated silica pigment and 40 pans of Airvol 125 polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (A 125) in the one case and an ainine functional polyvinyl alcohol of the type in<br>
Example 1 having 12 mole% amine MMW PVOH/PVNH2 in the other case and then applied to<br>
the paper at a coating weight of approximately 6 grams m2 . In preparing the coatings the<br>
polyvinyl alcohol was solubilized in water to a concentration of about 10% solids by weight.<br>
The pigment was ther. added. The testing was performed on an IGT model AIC2-5 following<br>
T.APPI procedure T514. The larger the value, the greater the coating strength. Table 1 sets forth<br>
conditions and results.<br>

The results show the vin\! alcohol vinyl amine copolymer containing 12 molar%<br>
hydrolyzcd N-vinylformamide gave higher pick strengths than the PVOH homopoly mer. thus<br>
showing the enhanced binding properties of the ink jet coating due to the presence of the pamary<br>
amine.<br>
Example 4<br>
Printed Ink Optical Density<br>
Sheets of uncoated base sheet were coated for the purpose of evaluating ink jet optical<br>
density. Several colors were evaluated. One set of base sheets was coated with an ink jet<br>
coating comprising PYOH and silica pigment and another set was coated with an ink jet coaling<br>
comprising 6 mole% MMW PVOH/PVNH2 and silica pigment coating using a Meyer Rod<br>
drawn down bar. The level of binder was varied from 70 weight parts to 30 weight pans per 100<br>
weight parts silica. Coat weight was in the range of 4 to 6 grams"m2. After coating and drying,<br>
the sheets were printed with an Hewlett Packard 560 ink jet printer using an HP test pattern<br>
distributed by Hewlett Packard for the purpose of testing ink jet paper media. After printing the<br>
samples were measured for optical density using a Tobias IQ 200 Reflection Densitometer.<br>
Figures 1 through 5 compare the ink optical density of the ink jet coatings comprising<br>
PYOH PY\H: copolymer binder versus the ink jet coatings comprising the standard PYOH<br>
binder. In the Figures:<br>
* 100% PYOH means that no silica was incorporated into the ink jet coating formulation.<br>
Airvol 125 polyvinyl alcohol is 99.3% hydrolyzed and has a molecular weight (Mw) of<br>
100.000.<br>
Airvo! 325 polyvinyl alcohol is 98.0% hydrolyzed and has a molecular weight (Mw) of<br>
110.000.<br>
Airvol 523 poiyvinyl alcohol is 88.0% hvdrolyzed and has a molecular weight (Mw) of<br>
110.000.<br>
PYOH PVAm is another abbreviation for PYOH PVNH2 the amine functional poiyvmyl<br>
alcohol of Example 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows thai monochrome ink jet optical density for the paper naving the ink jet<br>
coating incorporating the PVOH PV NH2 binder was superior to the paper having the ink jet<br>
coating incorporating the poiyvinyl alcohol in all cases except at the highest loading. On the<br>
other hand, the PYOH "PVNH2 based coating remained essentially constant at al levels<br>
Figure 2 shows that a: low levels of binder to silica, the PYOH Vam was superior to the<br>
PYOH thus showing enhanced binding strength.<br>
Figure 3 compares the magenta optical density achieved with the various coatings and<br>
particularly that the PVOH VA\m eopolymer was superior in about every category to the PVOH<br>
and especially at the low binder t to pigment levels.<br>
It may be seen in Figure 4 that the poivinyl alcohol polyviny lamine binder was<br>
significant!} better in performance vis-a-vis PYOH in the yellow optical density test. In contrast<br>
to the previons optical density test, substantially superior results were obtained with the amine<br>
functional polyvinyl alcohol at all levels.<br>
It is seen in Figure 5 that comparable results were obtained with the PYOH"YAm binder<br>
at high loadings but greater properties at the lower loading.<br>
Example 5<br>
Waterfastness<br>
The waterfastness of inks printed onto a paper coated with an ink jet coating<br>
incorporating PVOH/PVNH2 as the binder was compared to paper coated with the ink jet coating<br>
incorporating the PVOH homonolymer. The test was performed by first measuring the<br>
monochrome black ink density after printing. The printed area was then immersed in distilled<br>
water for 30 seconds ana dried on a hot plate under tension. The optical density was then<br>
measured again The results are set forth in Table -2.<br>

Between Pre Wet and Post Wet Paper Products<br>
Table 2 shows that the waterfasmess of printed inks is improved when the printing is<br>
effected omo a paper product having a silica based ink jet coating which incorporates the amine<br>
functional polyvinyi alcohol. As a binder, these results show that the loss in optical density after<br>
wetting decreases as the level of 6 mole%( PVOH"PVNH2 was increased in the coaling. These<br>
results also show that the ink jet coating incorporating the 12 moie% PVOH PVNH2- provides<br>
improved waterfastness as compared to the 6 rnoie°o PVOH"PVNH2;. copoiymer a: approximately<br>
equal addition levels.<br>
Example 6<br>
Rheology of ink let coatings<br>
Several ink jet coating formulations were prepared using different binders to determine<br>
their effect on the rheology of the resulting ink jet formulations. The graph (Fiiune 6)<br>
demonstrates the shear vs. visoosity response for a 13% solids coating formulated with 100 parts<br>
silica and 40 parts binder. Four hinder types were used and they are:<br>
1. Fully hydrolyzed medium molecular weight PVOH (FH MMW) the molecular<br>
weight was approximately 110.000.<br>
2. Pan-ally hydrolyzed medium molecular weight PVOH (PHNH2 MMW) the<br>
molecular weight was approximate!) 110.000.<br>
3. PVOH/ PVNH2 medium molecular weight 6 mole%. HC1 salt): the molecular weight<br>
was approximately 95.000.<br>
4. PYOH"PVNH2 medium molecular weight 12 mole % free base: the molecular<br>
weight was approximately 96.000.<br>
The shear viscosity of the coatings was measured with an ACAV High Shear Capillary<br>
Visoometer at temperatures of 35 100C<br>
The results in Figure 6 show that the silica based Ink Jet coatings incorporating the<br>
polyvinyl alcohol) vinyl amine ecpolymer binders produce a much lower viscosin response as<br>
compared to ink jet coatings incorporating poly vinyl alcohol) homopolymer as the binder. The<br>
mechanism for the reduced viscosity response to high shear is not known but may relate to the<br>
hish absorption of the amine functional PVOH onto the surface of the silica pigment. It is<br>
believed a greater absorption of the copolymer onto the surface of the silica would prevent the<br>
Polymer chains from extending into the liquid phase of the coating thereby lowering the overall<br>
 iscosity of the coating. The data also supports the view that the greater the amine content in the<br>
binder, the greater the absorption and the lower the snear thickening response.<br>
Example 7<br>
Lighfastness<br>
Several ink jet formulations were prepared for the purpose of determining the<br>
itghtfastness of the formulations The following table demonstrates the UV hghtfasiness of ink<br>
jet primed sheets with coatings based on 100 parts precipitated siiice pigment. Lignvfasiness was<br>
determined by measuring the optical density of ink jet printed papers before and after exposure<br>
54 hour UV light exposure. The optical densities of the paper were measured with a Tobias IQ<br>
200 Reflection Denshometer. The printed sheet then was exposed to UV light usinu a Q-U-V<br>
Accelerated Weathering Tester. The \alues were recorded and set forth in Table 5. ? represents<br>
the difference in optical density between the initial and exposed samples, the lower the value, the<br>
better the lightfastness.<br>
The results show that the lightfastness of ink jet primed colors improved when the<br>
PYOH PVNH2- copolymer was used as a binder for the ink jet coating compared to when PVOH<br>
hornopohmer was used as the binder for ink jet coatings. Lightfastness also improved with<br>
increased PVOH PVNH2 binder level in the coating as well as with increased amine content in<br>
the copolymer backbone. The mechanism for improved lightestness is not understood but may<br>
be due an increased light stability of the salt complex formed between the sulfonic acid groups of<br>
the dyes used in the inks and the amine in the amine functional polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
Example 8<br>
Dry Time<br>
Ink Jet coating formulations were prepared which vary in the % hydrolysis ol the various<br>
PVOH binders and compared for ink dry time (the time it lakes the ink to dry after printing from<br>
an ink jet primer) to a similar formulation which contained a 12 mole% medium molecular<br>
weight PVOH"PYAm binder. The coating consisted of a 100 parts precipitated silica pigment<br>
with 40 parts of the PVOH or PVOHPVAm binder prepared at a total solids level of 15% The<br>
formulations were Meyer Rod coated on to an base paper at coat weights between 7 and S<br>
grams square meter.<br>
The coated papers were tested for ink dry time according to procedures outlined in the<br>
"Hewlett Packard Paper Acceptance Criteria For HP Deskjet 500C. 550C &amp; 560C Printers".<br>
Results are shown in Figure 7. wherein:<br>
PH MMW refers to 87% hydrolysis at approximately 110.000 average molecular weight-.:<br>
1H MMW refers to 96% hydrolysis at approximately 110.000 average molecular weight <br>
SH MMW refers to 87% hydrolysis at approximately 110.000 average molecular weight:<br>
and<br>
PVOH"PVAm refers to 12 mole% vinyl amine at 95.000 average molecular weight.<br>
Figure7 demonstrates the improved dry time of the ink jet formulations containing<br>
PYOH PVAm versus the formulations containing the PVOH homopolymer.<br>
Example 9<br>
Ink Jet Impregnated Paper Product<br>
Paper products were prepared in accordance with the general procedure of US Patent<br>
4.880.497 in that the paper product was impregnated with the binder prior to coating rather than<br>
being applied the surface of the paper as a coating. The obiective was to determine whether<br>
comparable ink jet; properties could be achieved by impregnation, vis-a-vis coating, in addition<br>
to improving the paper"s wet and dry strength.<br>
As a second objective. me amine functional poiyvmyl alcohol, viz., hydrolyzed vinyl<br>
acetate n-vinyiformaniide was replaced and a commercial quaternized poiyvinyl alcohol<br>
substituted therefor.<br>
Paper products were prepared by adding the aqueous binder to a paper substrate a! the<br>
size press as opposed to applying the binder 10 the surface of" the paper as a paper coaling. Three<br>
methods were employed as follows:<br>
1. Three base sheets were prepared, one haying no coating. another coated with<br>
polyvinyl alcohol and another coated with amine functional polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
Silica was bound to the paper via the binder": no silica was employed in the absence<br>
of the binder.<br>
2. Three base sheets were prepared in accordance with 1 above except the paper was<br>
surface sized (impregnated ) with polyvinyl alcohol prior to coating w ith pol\ vinyl<br>
alcohol or amine functional polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
3. Three base sheets were prepared n accordance with 2 above except the paper was<br>
surface sized with the amine functional polyvinyl alcohol prior to coating with the<br>
respective binders. The results are set forth in Figures 8. 9 and 10.<br>
Results Summary<br>
Surface sizing a paper substrate with 12 mole % medium molecular weight PYOH YAm<br>
provided improved levels of optical density (one measure of ink jet printability) in comparison to<br>
sheets surfaced sized with Airvol 523 homopolymer and the non surface sized base sheet<br>
(Figure 8). However, the results show that by applying the binder as a coating as opposed to<br>
impregnation, the ink jet printing quality is enhanced substantial!}-. There appears to be little<br>
difference between the optical density in o PVOH PVNH2 coated paper and a PVOH "PV NH2<br>
impregnated and coated paper. Ink waterfastness of the three papers was very similar (see <br>
Figure 9). Airvol 523 polyvinyl aicohol surface sized sheets provided a higher level of paper<br>
drv strength in comparison to the PVOH VAm. Both surface size sheets provided strength<br>
greater than the base sheet.<br>
Example 10<br>
This example provides a comparison between ink jet papers coated with a PVOH "PVNH2<br>
aqueous binder and one coated with a eationic polyvinyl aicohoi sold by K.uraray as canonic<br>
polymer. C506. The results are shown in Figures 11 and 12.<br>
Fieure 11 show-s that coating the base sheet with a coating containing 100 cans of silica<br>
pigment and 40 parts of PVOH VAm; provided le. eis of ink optical density which were much<br>
greater than coatings containing 1 00 pans of sihea pigment with either 40 pans of Airvol 523 or<br>
40 parts of thc Kuriaray cationic polymer. C506. -Ml coaled papers provided levels of optical<br>
density which were greater than sheets which were surface sized only. Figure 12 shows that ink<br>
waterfastness was excellent with the PVOH/V"Am coating and very poor with the Airvol 523<br>
poiyvinyl alcohol and the Kuraray cationic polyvinyl alcohol. Dry strength of all coated sheets<br>
were approximately equal to each other and slightly greater than the base sheet. The coated<br>
sheets were much lower in dry strength as compared to the surface sized sheets.<br>
Example 1 1<br>
Ink Jet Paper Using<br>
4-amino butyral derivative of Polyyinyl Alcohol<br>
The procedure of Example 2 to make a 4-aminobutyral derivative of poly vinyl alcohol<br>
was followed except the polymer contained 7 mole% amine functionality. It was compared to<br>
polvvinvl alcohol as a binder and to other amine functional alcohols derived by the hydrolysis of<br>
a vinyl acetate-N-vinyl formamide copoiymer having the mole% amine functionality set forth.<br>
Figure 13 sets forth the results.<br>
The results show each of the amine functional polyvinyl alcohols were superior to<br>
polyviny1 alcohol. The table also shows that the 7% amine functionality was equivalent to the 12<br>
and 18% mole functional bydrolyzed vinyl acetate N-vinyl formamide polymer systems.<br>
In summary, the amine functional polyvinyl alcohols provide excellent properties to ink<br>
jet coatings for paper products and particularl; those ink iet coatings based upon silica. In<br>
almost every case the properties were improved vis-a-vis polyvinyl alcohol. When comparing<br>
the polyviny] alcohol polyvmyl amine binders, the 12 moie% amine was superior to 6 moie%<br>
amine. This is believed evidence that the amine provides cationic sites on the poiymer backbone<br>
which react with the inks from the ink jet printer to improve the ink optical density ink<br>
waterfastness. and ink light stabilitv. The greater the amine content, the greater rhe<br>
improvements. The amine group also contributes to the binding power of the binder and silica.<br>
It is also observed that the 4-aminobutyral derivative of polyvinyi alcohol affords slightly<br>
superior results to the hydrolyzed vinyl acetate N-vinylformamide polymers. This is believed<br>
due to the fact that the primary amine groups are in the form of extended side chains pendent<br>
from the poiymer backbone wherein the hydroivzed N-vinyl formamide groups are closely bound<br>
to the poivmer backbone. It is believed the side chains allow the amine cationic site better<br>
access to the inks and also allows the amine to more easily combine with the sihea.<br>
