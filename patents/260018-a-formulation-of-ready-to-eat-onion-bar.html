				<td>The present invention relates to a formulation for the preparation of ready-to-eat onion bar and a process thereof<br>
The product prepared by this method described herein is in the form of a bar that can be used as ready-to-eat product or as an adjunct in the preparation of bakery product (like tutty fruity). The product is in the form of bar and can be stored for 4 months after suitable packing The product contains moisture-13 2 %, pH-4 9, flavonoid (quercetin)- 56 7mg/100g<br>
Apart from its use as ready-to-eat product or secondary ingredient, this product can be used as nutraceuticals The physico-chemical properties of the final product are given as follows<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Onion contains moisture-86 8%, protein-1 2%, fat- 
Reference may be made to the patent in which onion is blended with lactic acid bacteria to give the aimed jam (JP 2182159, 1990-07-16) Reference may be made to the patent in which one kind of pickles and the delicious onion seed jam is produced with tuber onion seed as material and through simple technological process. The delicious tuber onion seed jam is rich in nutrients (CN 1432296, 2003-07-30)  Reference may be made to the<br>
patent in which Chinese prickly ash jam is prepared by blending fresh pncklyash and refined vegetable oil is heated to certain degree, and first the slices, then onion sections and at last the pncklyash are added The shells and seeds of pncklyash are separated, the pulverized pncklyash shells added with refined oil become pncklyash jam (CN 1082347, 1994-02-23) Reference may be made to the patent in which process for preparation of traditional-style 'soupe paysanne' and the soup so produced was discussed The soup is made from 3 components a vegetable soup base made from non-peeled courgettes, potatoes and haricot beans, a tomato/onion sauce, and an emulsion of cheese, garlic and basil in oil These components are prepared separately, then combined and briefly cooked together to form the final product The soup may be frozen(FR2637780A1, French-Patent-Apphcation, 1990) Reference may be made to the patent in which A barbecue sauce is described which contains a mixture of vinegar, lemon juice, sage, red pepper, paprika, black pepper, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, margarine, brown sugar, chilli powder, garlic salt, onion salt, seasoning salt, melt tendenzerr, tomato sauce and ketchup (US2002/0192349A1, 2002) Reference may be made to the patent in which a salad dressing preparation with a novel flavour, suitable for use with fresh salads, contains water, vegetable oil, vinegar containing 5% brandy, Vegeta (a Croatian seasoning), sugar, salt; pepper; cream of mushroom soup, French onion soup powder, and chives was discussed ( DE19930671A1), German-Federal-Republic-Patent-Application, 2001)<br>
Reference may be made to sources of onion flavouring i e , dehydrated whole onion, onion powder, enzymatically prepared onion oil and onion extracted (oleoresins), besides fresh onion which poses storage problems, are discussed All these products are used in commercially produced comminuted meat products, e g , beef burgers, pate and spreads (Heath-HB, Meat-, 54 (5) 43-45, 1981)   Reference may be made to the main<br>
processed onion products and their methods of preparation which were described under the headings dehydrated onion pieces (light coloured, and toasted), onion powder (air dried, and spray-dried), onion flavourings (sterile onion juice, and onion extracts on inert carriers), and pickled onions (Gummery-CS, Food-Trade-Review, 47 (8)452-454,1977)<br>
Reference may be made in which preparation of onion hydrolysate for usage of sauce was discussed (Won-Dai-Cho, Kwang-Won-Yoo, Journal of the Korean Society of Food Science and Nutntution,26(6), 1997) Reference may be made in which effect of onion juice on the polymerization of melanoidin in a model system was discussed (Tamaki,-M, Ukai,-M, Honma,-S, Joumal-of-Japanese-Society-of-Food-Science-and-Technology-(Nippon-Shokuhm-Kagaku Kogaku-Kaishi,45(1) 52-57 1998) However, the patents and scientific papers mentioned as above do not cover the present aspects of the preparation of onion bar<br>
The mam object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of ready-to-eat onion bar and a formulation thereof. Another object is the use of tomato pulp along with onion pulp and other ingredients<br>
Yet another object is the use of pectin in the formulation<br>
Yet another object is the use of starch in the formulation<br>
Yet another object is the use of sugar in the formulation<br>
Yet another object is the use of maltodextnn in the formulation<br>
Yet another object is the use of salt in the formulation<br>
Yet another object is the use of spice mix in the formulation<br>
Yet another object is the use to make blend of onion pulp, tomato pulp, sugar, maltodextnn, salt and boiling/concentrating them upto the TSS of 60-65Â°B and blending of spice mix and drying them in a hot air oven/tray drier into a paste or bar like product<br>
Accordingly a formulation for the preparation of ready-to-eat onion bar comprising the ingredients and their relative proportion as illustrated in the following table<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br><br>
The flow chart for the production of onion bar is provided in Fig 1<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
In an embodiment, of the present invention, peeled onion is sliced and macerated in a colloid mill with tomato<br>
In another embodiment, of the present invention, salt, maltodextnn, sugar, starch are added while macerating onion and tomato<br>
In yet another embodiment, the material from the colloid mill is mixed with pectin and cooked in a steam jacketed kettle till TSS reaches 60-65 degree Bnx<br>
In still another embodiment, spice mix is added to the cooked material and mixed thoroughly<br>
In still another embodiment, the cooked material is spread on trays and dried in a hot air drier at 60-65 degree C for 10-12 hour till the moisture reaches 13 2% to 13 8% wt basis<br>
In still another embodiment, dehydrated material is cut into rectangular pieces to obtain onion bar<br>
Novelty<br>
1	The product is rich in onion (39-41%) content and has characteristics similar to fruit bar.<br>
2	Since the product is having higher quantity of onion (flavonoid source, 56.7mg/100g product) and tomato (lycopene source), it can be used as nutraceuticals.<br>
3	High tomato content (41-42%) renders the product convenient for addition to the bakery products such as tutty-fruity bread, fruit cakes etc. in place of papaya products or jelly like products inside the candy<br>
4	The product can be considered as health food because of its quercetin content ranging from 53 to 56 7 mg/100 gram of product<br>
5   The product is in ready-to-eat form and can be used a component in food packets meant for emergency use<br>
