THIS APPLICATION HAS BEEN DIVIDED OUT OF INDIAN<br>
APPLICATION NO. 957/KOLNP/2003<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of arylethanoldiamine<br>
derivatives. Compounds of this type are known to be useful as agonists at atypical beta-<br>
adrenoceptors (also known as beta-3-adrenoceptors).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptors are known to occur in adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal<br>
tract. Atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists have been found to be particularly useful as<br>
thermogenic anti-obesity agents and as anti-diabetic agents. Compounds having atypical beta-<br>
adrenoceptor agonist activity have also been described as being useful in the treatment of<br>
hyperglycaemia, as animal growth promoters, as blood platelet aggregation inhibitors, as<br>
positive inotropic agents and as antiatherosclerotic agents, and as being useful in the<br>
treatment of glaucoma.<br>
Compounds which are agonists at atypical beta-adrenoceptors are described, for example, in<br>
WO 97/21665, WO 97/21666, WO 98/43953, WO 99/65877, WO 95/33724, EP 0455006 and<br>
EP 0543662.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have found an improved process for preparing arylethanoldiamine<br>
derivatives. The process of the present invention offers the advantage of achieving higher<br>
yields than previous processes: the process is shorter involving fewer steps, the reactions are<br>
more selective, e.g. the regioselectivity of epoxide opening is highly selective. The process of â€¢<br>
the present invention also offers an environmental advantage in that the quantities of toxic<br>
byproducts and solvents are reduced. The use of boron containing reagents is also no longer<br>
required.<br><br>

It will be appreciated that the above compounds of Formula (IA) are optically active.<br>
Processes for preparing individual, isolated isomers and mixtures thereof, including<br>
racemates, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preferably the compound of Formula (IA) is selected from:<br>

of Formula (IA) is a selective beta-3-adrenoceptor agonist.<br>
As used herein, a "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" means a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, or any other compound which, upon administration<br>
to the recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of Formula (IA)<br>
or an active metabolite or residue thereof. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
the compounds of Formula (IA) may be modified to provide pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives thereof at any of the functional groups in the compounds of Formula (IA). Of<br>
particular interest as such derivatives are compounds modified at the carboxyl function,<br>
hydroxyl functions or at amino groups. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of Formula (IA) may be<br>
derivatised at more than one position.<br>
Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of Formula (IA) are<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>

salicylic, succinic, toluene- p-sulphonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulphonic, formic,<br>
benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic and benzenesulphonic acids. Other acids such as<br>
oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable may be useful in the preparation<br>
of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include<br>
alkali metal (e.g. sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g. magnesium), ammonium and NR4+<br>
(where R is C1-4alkyl) salts.<br>
Preferably, hydrolysis of a compound of Formula (IB) to form a compound of Formula (IA)<br>
is carried out by reflux in the presence of an aqueous solution of a group 1 or group 2 metal<br>
hydroxide, e.g. NaOH or KOH, and preferably an alkanol, e.g. MeOH, for at least 4 hours.<br>
The hydrolysis may be full or partial. A compound of Formula (IA) in which X1 or X2 is (b)<br>
C1-6alkyl CO, or (c) an aryl CO group optionally substituted by halogen or a C1-6alkyl<br>
group, can be produced by the partial hydrolysis of a compound of Formula (IB) and isolated<br>
by standard chromatography techniques.<br>
The optional step of hydrolysing the ester group -CO2R8 to produce a compound of Formula<br>
(IA), wherein R4 is substituted by a -CO2H group can be carried out by a further hydrolysis<br>
step under standard hydrolysis conditions as would be apparent to a skilled person.<br>
In the following description, the groups R1, R2, R3, R5; R6, R7, R8, R9, R11, R12, W and A<br>
are as defined above unless otherwise stated. R4 is as defined in Formula (IB) above unless<br>
otherwise stated.<br>

a compound of Formula (IA) may be carried out separately or in situ. The reaction is<br>
preferably carried out in situ.<br>
A compound of Formula (III) may be prepared from a compound of Formula (IV):<br><br>

(0)). Suitable bases include, but are not limited to KOAc. Preferably, a solvent selected from<br>
toluene, DMA, DMF, NMP, isobutyronitrile and 1,2-diethoxy-ethane is present. A preferred<br>
solvent is toluene. The process is suitably carried out at elevated temperature, preferably at<br><br>
12<br>
80-120Â°C, more preferably at about 110Â°C. In process B, preferably R5 is COOH or<br>
COOCH3, preferably R6 and R7 represent hydrogen, and preferably Y represents bromine.<br>
More preferably, the compound of formula (V) is a 2-aryl-3-carboxy furan or thiophene or a<br>
5-aryl-3-carboxy furan or thiophene.<br><br>
For 2-aryl-3-carboxy furan or thiophene product, use of the palladium catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 in<br>
the presence of the base KOAc is preferred. On a preparative scale (50g of Aryl bromide) the<br>
optimum conditions were found to be 1.4eq of ethyl 3-furoate, 5 mol% Pd(PPh3)4, toluene<br>
reflux 24 hrs afforded the 2-aryl product in 76% yield. This represents an increased<br>
selectivity for synthesis over previously known processes. For 5-aryl-3-carboxy furan<br>
product, use of the palladium catalyst Pd/C in the presence of the solvent NMP and the base<br>
KOAc is preferred. For the 5-aryl-3-carboxy thiophene product use of the palladium catalyst<br>
Pd2(dba)3 in the presence of solvent NMP and the base KOAc is preferred.<br>
Compounds of Formula (V) may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula<br>
(VIII) with a compound of Formula (IX) using standard boronic acid coupling methods<br>
described above.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula (VI) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula (X)<br>
with anhydrous HC1.<br><br><br>
13<br>
Further methods for preparing compounds of Formula (V) are disclosed in WO 97/21665.<br>
Compounds of Formulae (VII), (VIIa), (VIIb), (VIII), (IX) and (X) are known compounds<br>
and can be prepared by processes well known in the art.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in the preparation of the compound of<br>
Formula (IA) or a solvate thereof it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect one or more<br>
sensitive groups in the molecule to prevent undesirable side reactions. The protecting groups<br>
used in the preparation of the compound of Formula (LA.) may be used in a conventional<br>
manner. See for example Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Ed. J.F.W. McOmie,<br>
Plenum Press, London (1973) or Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora Green,<br>
John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981). Conventional amino protecting groups may include<br>
for example aralkyl groups, such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl groups; and<br>
acyl groups such as N-benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl. Conventional oxygen<br>
protecting groups may include for example alky silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl or tert-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl; alkyl ethers such as tetrahydropyranyl or tert-butyl; or esters such as<br>
acetate.<br>
Removal of any protecting groups present may be achieved by conventional procedures.<br>
An arylalkyl group such as benzyl, may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, e.g., palladium on charcoal; an acyl group such as N-benzyloxycarbonyl may be<br>
removed by hydrolysis with, for example, hydrogen bromide in acetic acid or by reduction,<br>
for example by catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
As will be appreciated, in any of the general processes described above it may be<br>
desirable or even necessary to protect any sensitive groups in the molecule as just described.<br>
Thus, a reaction step involving deprotection of a protected derivative of general Formula (IA)<br>
or a salt thereof may be carried out subsequent to any of the above described processes.<br><br>
14<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, the following reactions may, if<br>
necessary and/or desired be carried out in any appropriate sequence subsequent to any of the<br>
general processes:<br>
(i)   removal of any protecting groups; and<br>
(ii)  conversion of a compound of Formula (IA) or a solvate thereof into a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvate thereof.<br>

Into a 4-necked RBF equipped with an overhead stirrer, J-Kem internal temperature probe, a<br>
reflux condensor and an addition funnel was placed isonicotinoyl chloride-hydrochloride<br>
(50g, 0.28 mol). To this solid was added 500ml of 1,2-dichloroethane and the slurry cooled to<br><br>
0Â°C using an ice/water bath. To the addition funnel was added a mixture of the aniline (31.4g,<br>
0.34 mol) and Et3N (59.5g, 0.59 mol) in 50ml of 1,2-dichloroethane. This mixture was<br>
slowly added to the slurry over 25 min. A slight exotherm was observed from 2.4Â°C to 15Â°C<br>
after the addition of the first 10ml. The reaction mixture was observed to cool down slowly.<br>
The reaction mixture turned yellow and became heterogeneous. After 30 min., the ice bath<br>
was removed and the reaction heated to reflux for 1.5h. Deionized water, 100 ml, was added<br>
and an off-white precipitate formed. The precipitate was collected by filtering through paper<br>
on a Buchner funnel and placed in a drying oven (60Â°C) overnight to give 45g (81% th) of an<br>
off-white crystalline solid.<br>

Stage 2(a) Preparation of N-Phenyl-3-bromoisonicotinamide<br>
As described in Synthetic Communications 1997, 27, 1075-1086, a 4-necked RBF equipped<br>
with an overhead stirrer and a J-Kem internal temperature probe was placed N-<br>
phenylisonicotinamide (35.7g, 0.18 mol) and anhydrous THF (700 ml). All material appeared<br>
to go into solution. This mixture was cooled to -69Â°C in a dry ice/IPA bath. To this was<br>
slowly added nBuLi (158 ml of a 2.5 M solution in Hexanes) in three portions. While adding<br>
the first equivalent of nBuLi, an exotherm was observed raising the temperature to ca. -41Â°C.<br>
The orange reaction mixture was slightly heterogeneous. This was allowed to slowly warm to<br>
-5 to 0Â°C over 1.5hrs in a ice/brine bath. The reaction mixture was recooled to -72Â°C and<br>
1,2-dibromoethane (36g, 0.189 mol) in 15 ml of THF was added. A slight exotherm was<br>
observed rising to -62Â°C. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight. The reaction<br>
mixture was poured into a flask containing 10 vol. SiO2- Methanol (100 ml) was added and<br>
the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The dried silica gel was then placed on<br>
top of a bed of silica gel. The plug of silica gel was washed with 40% ethyl acetate/Hexane as<br>
eluent. Concentration of 10 liters of solvent afforded an off-white solid. The material was<br>
placed in vacuum drying at 60Â°C overnight to provide 34g (68%th) of an off-white solid.<br>

Into a 4-necked RBF equipped with an overhead stirrer and a J-Kem internal temperature<br>
probe was placed N-phenylisonicotinamide (35.lg, 0.18 mol) and anhydrous THF (700 ml).<br>
All material appeared to go into solution. This mixture was cooled to -69Â°C in a dry ice/IPA<br>
bath. To this was slowly added nBuLi (156 ml of a 2.5 M in Hexanes) in two portions. While<br>
adding the first equivalent of nBuLi, an exotherm was observed raising the temperature to<br>
approx. -41Â°C. The orange reaction mixture was slightly heterogeneous. This was allowed to<br>
slowly warm to 12Â°C over 2h. This mixture was re-cooled to -70Â°C. At this point, a THF<br>
solution (175 ml) of iodine (47.2 g, 0.19 mol) was added. This was allowed to warm and<br>
stirred at room temperature for 14h. To this solution was added 150 ml of a saturated solution<br>
of potassium rheta-bisulfite and diluted with CH2C12- The two layers were separated and the<br>
organic layer was extracted with brine. The two layers were separated and the organic layer<br>
was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a black oil.<br>
This material was purified by SiO2 column chromatography using 40% ethyl acetate/Hexane<br>
as eluent. Concentration gave 38.6g (67% th) of an off-white solid.<br>
Stage 3      Preparation of 3-Bromoisonicotinic acid hydrochloride<br>
To an RBF equipped with a condenser and outfitted with a heating mantle was placed the N-<br>
phenyl-3-bromo-isonicotinamide (34g, 0.123 mol) and 200 ml of 25% HCl. The reaction was<br>
left to stir for 3 days. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and diluted with ethyl<br>
acetate. The aqueous layer was extracted and the two layers separated. To the aqueous layer,<br>
solid Na2CO3 was added until the pH~4-5 and a dark oil layer appeared. This was then<br>
diluted and extracted with ethyl acetate. The two layers were separated and the aqueous layer<br>
was concentrated under reduced pressure to give an off-white solid. To this 100 ml of 2M<br>
HCl was added and the solids collected. The off-white solids were placed in a vacuum oven at<br>
60Â°C overnight. Yield: 22.4g (76%th).<br>

The mixture was heated at reflux for 1h and allowed to cool to room temperature. The<br>
mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure to give an off-white solid. To this was<br>
added methanol and this was refluxed for 2 hrs. The mixture was then concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure and diluted with ethyl acetate. The precipitate was collected on filter paper<br>
on a Buchner funnel. The white solid was washed with ethyl acetate and air-dried. The white<br>
