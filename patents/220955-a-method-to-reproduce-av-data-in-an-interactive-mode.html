The aspects are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, 'mark-up documents' includes all documents written in the mark-up language, such as HTML or XML, and documents where source codes written in a script language or Java is linked or inserted and even represents mark-up resource, such as files linked to a mark-up document.   In other words, the mark-up document serves as an application program^ reproduce AV data in an interactive mode and contains interactive contents to be displayed together with the AV data.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a reproduction system, according to an aspect of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 1. the<br><br>
reproduction system includes a DVD 300, which is a data storage medium according to an aspect of the present invention, an apparatus 200 to reproduce data, a TV set 100, which is a display device according to an aspect of the present invention, and a remote controller 400, which is a user input device.    The remote controller 400 receives a control command from a user and transmits the control command to the apparatus 200 to reproduce the data.    The apparatus 200 to reproduce the data includes a DVD drive 201 to reproduce the data from the DVD 300.   When the DVD 300 is loaded onto the DVD drive 201 and the user selects the interactive mode, the apparatus 200 to reproduce the data reproduces the AV data recorded on the DVD 300 in the interactive mode using the mark-up document corresponding to the AV data and transmits the reproduced AV data to the TV set 100.    The TV set 100 displays a mark-up screen obtained using the mark-up document with an AV screen obtained by reproducing the AV data.   The AV screen is embedded in the mark-up screen.    Here, the interactive mode represents a display mode in which the AV data is reproduced, displayed in a display window defined by the mark-up document, i.e., a display mode in which the AV screen displays the AV data and is embedded in the mark-up screen.   Here, the AV screen represents a screen displayed on the display device, i.e., the TV set 100, when reproducing the AV data, and the mark-up screen represents a screen displayed on the display device when interpreting the mark-up document.   A screen displayed in an interactive mode is called an interactive screen.   The interactive screen includes the AV screen and the mark-up screen.   A video mode represents a conventional data reproduction mode defined by DVD-video standards, i.e., a mode in which only the AV screen obtained by reproducing the AV data is displayed.   In an aspect of the presept invention, the apparatus 200 supports both the interactive mode and the video mode.<br>
The apparatus 200 provides a parental level setting button or an on-screen display menu that enables the user to set a parental level.   In<br><br>
addition, the apparatus 200 can receive the data from and transmit the lata to other devices through a network, such as the Internet.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example of the apparatus 200 to -eproduce the data, according to an aspect of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the apparatus 200 includes a reader 2, a controller 3, an AV decoder 4, and a blender 7.    A presentation engine 5 is provided in the controller 3.    An optical pickup (not shown) for reading the data from the DVD 300 by radiating laser beams on the DVD 300 is provided in the reader 2.    The reader 2 controls the optical pickup in response to a control signal output by the controller 3 so that the optical pickup reads the AV data and the mark-up document from the DVD 300.   The AV decoder 4 decodes the AV data read from the DVD 300.    In a case where the AV data has been recorded on the DVD 300 according to the DVD-video standards, the AV decoder 4 decodes the AV data following the DVD-video standards.<br>
From software's point of view, the presentation engine 5 in the controller 3 is an engine for interpreting and executing a mark-up language or a client interpretation program language, such as JavaScript or Java.   The presentation engine 5 may further include various plugs-in. Files of various formats included in the mark-up document or linked to the mark-up document can be opened by such plugs-in.    For example, Window Media Player may be called by the presentation engine 5 to reproduce Window Media Player AV data files.    In addition, the presentation engine 5 can bring predetermined data, such as the mark-up documents, from other devices through the network.<br>
The presentation engine 5 interprets the mark-up document<br>
r*<br>
t<br>
read from the DVD 300 so as to reproduce the AV data recorded^n the DVD 300 in the interactive mode.   In other words, the presentation engine 5 identifies the parental level set by the user for the apparatus 200 and interprets the mark-up document in consideration of the parental level.<br><br>
In an aspect according to the present invention, tnere are provided five different parental levels, i.e., G, PG, PG13, R, and NC-17, which are the same as those defined by the DVD-video standards for compatibility.    The mark-up documents, according to an aspect of the present invention, are provided to reproduce the AV data recorded on the data storage medium according to the DVD-video standards in an interactive mode, and the mark-up documents are provided according to the parental levels for compatibility.    The presentation engine 5 uses an application program interface (API) to identify the parental level set for the apparatus 200.   The presentation engine 5, however, may use the API defined by conventional interactive DVD-video standards, i.e., InterActual API Specification.   The example of the API is as follows.<br>
1.	Property<br>
ParentalLevel<br>
2.	Summary<br>
Return a current parental level value<br>
3.	Return values<br>
ECMASCript Number Signed 1 byte integer<br>
Parental level ranging from 1 to 8 where 1 = G, 2 = Reserved, 3 = PG, 4<br>
= PG13, 5 = Reserved, 6 - R, 7 = NC-17, and 8 = Reserved<br>
The user may set the parental level at any of 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The presentation engine 5 can identify the parental level set for the apparatus 200 to reproduce the data by using "ParentLever properties of the API.<br>
The blender 7 blends the AV data stream with the interpreted mark-up document so that the AV data stream can be displayed in the display window defined by the mark-up document; in other wordsirthe AV screen can be embedded in the mark-up document screen.   Thereafter, the blender 7 outputs the result of the blending to the TV set 100.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating directories of data recorded on the DVD 300 on which data is recorded, according to a first aspect of the<br><br>
present invention.    Referring to FIG. 3, a root directory includes a video directory VIDEOJTS in which the AV data is stored.    In the video directory VIDEOJTS, a navigation file VIDEO_TS.IFO containing navigation information of all video title sets is stored.    Then, a navigation file VTS_01_0.IFO containing the navigation information of a first video title set, and the AV data VTS_01_0.VOB, VTSJ)1 J.VOB, .... constituting the video title set are recorded.    Each of the plurality of the AV data VTSJ31JXVOB, VTS_01 jl.VOB, .... is a video title, i.e., a video object.    Each video object VOB includes a video object unit VOBU, which is a package of a navigation pack, a video pack, and an audio pack.    A detailed structure of VIDEO_TS has been disclosed in 'DVD-Video for Read Only Memory Disc 1.0* dealing with DVD-video standards.<br>
An interactive directory DVD_ENAV is provided as a sub-directory of the root directory.    In the interactive directory DVD_ENAV, mark-up documents for supporting an interactive mode are stored.    In particular, in the interactive directory DVD_ENAV, a start-up document STARTURXML, and mark-up documents INDEX.XML and WARNING.XML for selectively showing a parental level are stored.    In addition, other mark-up documents, i.e., files inserted into STARTURXML, INDEX.XML, and WARNING.XML, are also stored in the interactive directory DVD_ENAV.<br>
The start-up document STARTUP   XML contains the parental level information and link information.    In an aspect of the present invention, the parental level information is a parental level written in the start-up document STARTURXML, and the link information is the mark-up document information indicating whether.the parental.Jevjel set by the user is higher or lower than the parental level written in the start-up document STARTURXML.   An example of the start-up document STARTURXML is as follows.<br><br><br>
The start-up document STARTURXML contains meta-information <meta name=',,ParentalLevel"' contents="4H /&gt; concerning the parental level and the link information &lt;link rel=" firstpage href="dvd://dvd_enav/index.xmr%20/&gt;%20&lt;link%20rel=" warning om the mark-up document.>
In an aspect according to the present invention, the CSS file ;ontains display rule information.   The display rule information is written according to a "@media rule" style defined by CSS standards.    An example of "@media rule" defining display rules for target media is as follows,<br>
U 	.			,		J<br>
According to the above "@media rule", the target media is printed out having a font size of 10 and a line space of 1.2 and is displayed on the screen having the font size of 12 and the line space of 1.2.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention, the display rule information written according to CSS standards is as follows.<br><br><br>
Here, @parentalLevel-display indicates that an element having a "class" attribute value of 3, 4, 6, or 7 sets parameters "display" and "visibility" as "box" and "hidden", respectively, when the parental level is G.<br>
In particular, if the parameter "display" is set as "box", box regions are generated and continue to exist even when the box regions are not physically seen.    If the parameter "display" is set as "none", generation of all the boxes is banned so that the arrangement of the mark-up documents is more likely to get messed up because even unseen box regions can help arrange the mark-up documents.    In other words, by setting the parameter "display" as "box", the mark-up documents can be well arranged.    The parameter "visibility" is used to determine whether or not such generated box regions are to be seen.<br>
An example of the mark-up document INDEX.XML including the display rule information written according to CSS standards is as follows.<br><br><br>
As shown in the above example, the parental level value is allotted to each element in the "body" of the mark-up document INDEX.XML as a "class" attribute value.   Whether to display each element is determined based upon the display rule information @parentalLevel-display.<br><br>
An example of the mark-up document INDEX.XML and its display rule information, which is provided as an individual single following CSS standards, i.e., INDEX.CSS, is as follows.<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, the mark-up document INDEX.XML may be written using a script language, such as JavaScript, so as to represent a document appropriate for the corresponding parental level.   The script language, which is a programming language, may be used in various manners.   An example of the mark-up document INDEX.XML using the script language is as follows.<br><br><br><br>
In the above example of the mark-up document INDEX.XML, 'ParentalLevel" that has been described above is used a property for reading a currently set parental level, and ways to represent documents appropriate for their parental levels are written in the script language using simple if-sentences.<br>
The if-sentences are written so that the mark-up document INDEX.XML can be linked to the CSS file and/or the JavaScript file provided separately<br>
Hereinafter, the method to reproduce the data in the interactive mode, according to an aspect of the present invention, will be described in greater detail based upon the above-described structures of the reproduction system and data written on the DVD 300.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of the method to reproduce the data in the interactive mode, according to an aspect of the present invention.
