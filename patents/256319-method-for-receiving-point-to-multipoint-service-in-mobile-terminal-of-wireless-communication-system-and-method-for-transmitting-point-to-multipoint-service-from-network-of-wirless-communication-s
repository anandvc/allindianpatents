Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
 [1]	The present invention relates to a point-to-multipoint service in a mobile com-<br>
	munication system, and more particularly, to transmitting and receiving a notification<br>
of control information for a point-to-multipoint service.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third-generation<br>
mobile communications system evolving from a global system for mobile commu-<br>
nications system (GSM), which is the European standard. The UMTS is aimed at<br>
providing enhanced mobile communications services based on the GSM core network<br>
and wideband code-division multiple-access technologies.<br>
[3]	A related art UMTS network structure 1 is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown, a<br>
mobile terminal, or user equipment (UE) 2 is connected to a core network (CN) 4<br>
through a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) 6. The UTRAN 6<br>
configures, maintains and manages a radio access bearer for communications between<br>
the UE 2 and the core network 4 to meet end-to-end quality of service requirements.<br>
[4]	The UTRAN 6 includes a plurality of radio network subsystems (RNS) 8, each of<br>
which comprises one radio network controller (RNC) 10 for a plurality base stations,<br>
or Node Bs 12. The RNC 10 connected to a given base station 12 is the controlling<br>
RNC for allocating and managing the common resources provided for any number of<br>
UEs 2 operating in one cell. One or more cells exist in one Node B. The controlling<br>
RNC 10 controls traffic load, cell congestion, and the acceptance of new radio links.<br>
Each Node B 12 may receive an uplink signal from a UE 2 and may transmit a<br>
downlink signals to the UE 2. Each Node B 12 serves as an access point enabling a UE<br>
2 to connect to the UTRAN 6, while an RNC 10 serves as an access point for<br>
connecting the corresponding Node Bs to the core network 4.<br>
[5]	Among the radio network subsystems 8 of the UTRAN 6, the serving RNC 10 is<br>
the RNC managing dedicated radio resources for the provision of services to a specific<br>
UE 2 and is the access point to the core network 4 for data transfer to the specific UE.<br>
All other RNCs 10 connected to the UE 2 are drift RNCs, such that there is only one<br>
serving RNC connecting the UE to the core network 4 via the UTRAN 6. The drift<br>
RNCs 10 facilitate the routing of user data and allocate codes as common resources.<br>
[6]	The interface between the UE 2 and the UTRAN 6 is realized through a radio<br><br>
interface protocol established in accordance with radio access network specifications<br>
describing a physical layer (L1), a data link layer (L2) and a network layer (L3)<br>
described in, for example, 3GPP specifications. These layers are based on the lower<br>
three layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) model mat is a well-known in<br>
communications systems.<br>
[7]	A related art architecture of the radio interface protocol is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
As shown, the radio interface protocol is divided horizontally into a physical layer, a<br>
data link layer, and a network layer, and is divided vertically into a user plane for<br>
carrying data traffic such as voice signals and Internet protocol packet transmissions<br>
and a control plane for carrying control information for the maintenance and<br>
management of the interface.<br>
[8]	The physical layer (PHY) provides information transfer service to a higher layer<br>
and is linked via transport channels to a medium access control (MAC) layer. Data<br>
travels between the MAC layer and the physical layer via a transport channel. Also,<br>
data transmission is performed through a physical channel between different physical<br>
layers, namely, between physical layers of a sending side (transmitter) and a receiving<br>
side (receiver).<br>
[9]	The MAC layer of the second layer (L2) provides information transfer service to a<br>
higher layer and is linked via a logical channel to a radio link control (RLC) layer. The<br>
RLC layer of the second layer (L2) supports the transmission of reliable data and can<br>
perform segmentation and concatenation functions for RLC service data units (SDU)<br>
received from an upper layer.<br>
[10]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer<br>
(L3) is only defined in the controlplane and controls transport channels and physical<br>
channels with respect to the establishment, re-establishment, and release of radio<br>
bearers. A radio bearer (RB) is a service provided by a lower layer, such as the RLC<br>
layer or the MAC layer, for transferring data between the UE 2 and the UTRAN 6.<br>
[11]	The establishment of an RB determines regulating characteristics of the protocol<br>
layer and channel needed to provide a specific service, thereby establishing the<br>
parameters and operational methods of the service. When a connection is established to<br>
allow transmission between an RRC layer of a specific UE 2 and an RRC layer of the<br>
UTRAN 6, the UE 2 is said to be in the RRC-connected state. Without such<br>
connection, the UE 2 is in an idle state.<br>
[12]	Hereafter, a Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS or 'MBMS service')<br>
will be described. MBMS refers to a method of providing streaming or background<br>
services to a plurality of UEs 2 using a downlink-dedicated MBMS radio bearer that<br>
utilizes at least one of point-to-multipoint and point-to-point radio bearer. One MBMS<br>
service includes one or more sessions and MBMS data is transmitted to the plurality of<br><br>
terminals through the MBMS radio bearer only while the session is ongoing.<br>
[13]	As the name implies, an MBMS may be carried out in a broadcast mode or a<br>
multicast mode. The broadcast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to all UEs 2<br>
within a broadcast area, for example the domain where the broadcast is available. The<br>
multicast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to a specific UE 2 group within a<br>
multicast area, for example the domain where the multicast service is available.<br>
[14]	The UTRAN 6 provides the MBMS service to the UEs 2 using the RB. RBs used<br>
by the UTRAN 6 can be classified as a point-to-point RB or a point-to-multipoint RB.<br>
The point-to-point RB is a bi-directional RB, including a logical channel DTCH<br>
(Dedicated Traffic Channel), a transport channel DCH (Dedicated Channel) and a<br>
physical channel DPCH (Dedicated Physical Channel) or SCCPCH (Secondary<br>
Common Control Physical Channel).<br>
[15]	The point-to-multipoint RB is a uni-directional downlink RB, including a logical<br>
channel MTCH (MBMS Traffic Channel), a transport channel FACH (Forward Access<br>
Channel), and the physical channel SCCPCH, as shown in Figure 3. The logical<br>
channel MTCH is configured for each MBMS service provided to one cell and used to<br>
transmit user plane data of a specific MBMS service to the UEs 2.<br>
[16]	The UTRAN 6 providing the MBMS service transmits MBMS-related control in-<br>
formation to the plurality of terminals (UEs 2) through an MCCH (MBMS Control<br>
Channel). Herein, the logical channel MCCH is the point-to-multipoint downlink<br>
channel and is mapped to the FACH, which is mapped to the SCCPCH. The MBMS-<br>
related control information includes a session start for indicating the start of an MBMS<br>
service, a session stop for indicating the end of the MBMS service, an RB type<br>
indicator for indicating whether the MBMS service is provided via a point-to-point RB<br>
or a point-to-multipoint RB, RB information for providing point-to-multipoint RB in-<br>
formation such as the MTCH if the RB is a point-to-multipoint RB, counting in-<br>
formation for measuring the number of terminals desiring to receive the MBMS<br>
service, and re-counting information for re-counting the number of terminals desiring<br>
the MBMS service while the MBMS service is being provided.<br>
[17]	Figure 3 illustrates channel mapping for an MBMS of a UE side. The MBMS-<br>
related control information may be included in an independent message and<br>
transmitted, or can be entirely included in one MBMS control message. To transmit<br>
various control information related to the MBMS service, the logical channel MCCH is<br>
used. Channel mapping of the MCCH is similar to that of the MTCH. Namely, the<br>
MCCH is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel and is mapped to the transport<br>
channel FACH, which is mapped to the physical channel SCCPCH. For reference, only<br>
one MTCH is provided for one service, while only one MCCH is provided for one cell.<br>
[18]	The terminal (UE) 2 wishing to receive an MBMS service, must first receive<br><br>
MBMS control information through the MCCH. However, because the terminal 2 can<br>
receive only one SCCPCH for the MBMS, and the MCCH is transmitted through a<br>
different SCCPCH irrelative to the MTCH, the terminal cannot receive the MCCH if<br>
the terminal has already received one or more MBMS services.<br>
[19]	Figure 4 illustrates a related art method for transmitting MCCH information. The<br>
MCCH information is periodically transmitted according to a modification period and<br>
a repetition period. Furthermore, the MCCH information is divided into critical in-<br>
formation and non-critical information. The non-critical information may be easily<br>
modified during each modification period and repetition period to be transmitted.<br>
However, the critical information may be modified only during each modification<br>
period to be transmitted. As such, the critical information may be repeatedly<br>
transmitted once per repetition period; however, modified critical information may be<br>
transmitted only at a beginning point of the modification period.<br>
[20]	A UE desiring to receive a specific MBMS service using a point-to-multipoint RB<br>
receives the MCCH information including RB information through an MCCH channel.<br>
The UE then establishes the point-to-multipoint RB using the MCCH information.<br>
Once the point-to-multipoint RB is established, the UE continues to receive a physical<br>
channel SCCPCH, to which an MTCH is mapped, to obtain specific MBMS service<br>
data transmitted through the MTCH.<br>
[21]	Figure 5 is an example of a transmission of discontinuous MBMS data, scheduling<br>
information and a Secondary Notification Indicator (SNI) through a physical channel<br>
SCCPCH. The UTRAN can discontinuously transmit MBMS data through an MTCH.<br>
At the same time, the UTRAN can periodically transmit scheduling information to the<br>
UE through an SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped. Here, the scheduling in-<br>
formation notifies the UE of a transmission interval of the MBMS service transmitted<br>
during one scheduling period. Previously, the UTRAN notified the UE of a<br>
transmission period of the scheduling information, namely, the scheduling period, to<br>
allow the UE to receive the scheduling information. Therefore, once the UE has<br>
obtained the scheduling period from the UTRAN, the UE then receives the scheduling<br>
information according to the obtained scheduling period. The UE also discontinuously<br>
receives the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped by using the received scheduling<br>
information.<br>
[22]	Still referring to Figure 5, while the MTCH for a specific MBMS service is es-<br>
tablished, the UTRAN can transmit a secondary notification indicator (SNI) to the UE<br>
through the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped. When MCCH information for a<br>
certain MBMS service is transmitted through the MCCH, the SNI notifies the MCCH<br>
information transmission to the UE receiving a corresponding MTCH. In other words,<br>
when the MCCH information to be transmitted through the MCCH exists, the UTRAN<br><br>
transmits the SNI to the UE through the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped.<br>
Therefore, the UE first receives the SNI through the SCCPCH and then receives the<br>
MCCH according to an indication of the SNI. The UE then receives the MCCH in-<br>
formation through the MCCH. The SNI can be transmitted or received through the<br>
MTCH or through another logical channel mapped to the SCCPCH together with the<br>
MTCH.<br>
[23]	However, in the related art, the UE cannot recognize when the SNI is to be<br>
transmitted. For instance, as shown in Figure 4, when the UE discontinuously receives<br>
the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped according to the scheduling information,<br>
only a transmission interval of the MB MS data is notified by the scheduling in-<br>
formation. As a result, the UE receives the SCCPCH only during an interval that the<br>
MBMS service is transmitted.<br>
[24]	Therefore, the UE discontinuously receiving the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is<br>
mapped may not receive the SNI. When the SNI is not received, the corresponding UE<br>
may not receive a notification message, which the UTRAN transmits through the<br>
MCCH.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[53]	The present invention relates to transmitting and receiving a notification of control<br>
information for a point-to-multipoint service.<br>
[54]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The<br>
present invention is embodied in a mobile communication system, such as a UMTS<br>
(Universal Mobile Telecommunications system). However, the present invention can<br>
be applied to communication systems, which may be operated according to other spec-<br>
ifications.<br><br>
[55]	In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided<br>
for when MBMS data is discontinuously transmitted, a UE or mobile terminal can<br>
receive a notification indicator, such as a secondary notification indicator, and ef-<br>
ficiently receive a physical channel, such as an SCCPCH, to which a logical channel,<br>
such as an MTCH, is mapped.<br>
[56]	For this purpose, network transmits MBMS control information through a first<br>
physical channel and a notification indicator through a second physical channel,<br>
wherein the notification indicator indicates the existence of specific MBMS service<br>
data and MBMS control information. The network transmits the notification indicator<br>
during a designated time interval every certain period. Then, the mobile terminal<br>
receives the MBMS control information through the first physical channel and the<br>
specific MBMS service data and the notification indicator through the second physical<br>
channel. During this procedure, the mobile terminal receives the notification indicator<br>
during a designated time interval every certain period.<br>
[57]	Preferably, the network transmits a transmission period of the notification indicator<br>
to the mobile terminal before transmitting the notification indicator. Specifically, the<br>
network transmits a period wherein the notification indicator is transmitted to the<br>
mobile terminal through a logical channel, such as an MCCH or BCCH, before<br>
transmitting the specific MBMS service data.<br>
[58]	Preferably, the MBMS control information is transmitted periodically. The no-<br>
tification indicator indicates whether the mobile terminal, subscribed to the specific<br>
MBMS service, should receive the MBMS control information expected to be<br>
transmitted at a subsequent period. That is, the notification indicator indicates whether<br>
the MBMS control information for the specific MBMS service is to be modified at the<br>
subsequent period. Therefore, when the MBMS control information is modified at the<br>
subsequent period, the mobile termirial subscribed to the specific MBMS service<br>
receives the corresponding MBMS control information.<br>
[59]	Preferably, the notification indicator is transmitted through a logical channel, such<br>
as an MTCH, or through another logical channel mapped together with the MTCH to a<br>
physical channel, such as an SCCPCH. The other logical channel may be a Secondary<br>
MCCH (S-MCCH), which is a logical channel used for transmitting the notification<br>
indicator.<br>
[60]	Figure 6 illustrates a method for transmitting a notification indicator in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 6, the notification<br>
indicator is transmitted once per a certain period. Here, the certain period is a no-<br>
tification indicator period. The notification indicator notifies whether control in-<br>
formation for one or more MBMS services is to be modified, respectively. Therefore,<br>
the notification indicator includes an MBMS service ID and the modified contents of<br><br>
the control information. The notification indicator is transmitted through a logical<br>
channel MTCH, or through a logical channel S-MCCH, mapped together with an<br>
MTCH, to a physical channel SCCPCH.<br>
[61]	Figure 7 illustrates a time correlation between a notification indicator transmission<br>
and an MCCH information transmission. The MCCH transmits the MCCH information<br>
including MBMS control information based on a modification period and a repetition<br>
period. Notification indicators transmitted during a Modification Period #n inform the<br>
mobile terminal of whether the MCCH information to be transmitted during a<br>
subsequent Modification Period #n+l is to be modified. Here, a physical channel<br>
through which the MCCH is transmitted may be different from a physical channel<br>
through which the MTCH is transmitted.<br>
[62]	Still referring to Figure 7, the mobile terminal receiving the SCCPCH mapped to<br>
the MTCH receives the notification indicator transmitted during the Modification<br>
Period #n. If the received notification indicator indicates that the MCCH information<br>
to be transmitted at the subsequent Modification Period #n+l is to be modified, the<br>
mobile terminal receives the MCCH information transmitted during the Modification<br>
Period #n+1.<br>
[63]	Figure 8 illustrates a method of a mobile terminal depending on a time correlation<br>
between a notification indicator transmission and an MCCH information transmission.<br>
In the present invention, because the notification indicator is periodically transmitted, a<br>
UE RRC receives information about a notification indicator transmission period from a<br>
UTRAN RRC before receiving the notification indicator. Afterwards, first and second<br>
layers of the UE attempt a reception of the notification indicator once per notification<br>
indicator period according to an indication of the UE RRC.<br>
[64]	When establishing an MTCH-mapped SCCPCH, the UE determines whether a<br>
reception-ongoing time interval is a time interval wherein the notification indicator is<br>
transmitted with respect to every transmission time interval (TTI) (step S10). If the<br>
reception-ongoing time interval is the time interval wherein the notification indicator is<br>
transmitted, the UE receives the SCCPCH during the time interval (step S11).<br>
[65]	The UE identifies whether a data unit received at the time interval corresponds to<br>
the notification indicator or not (step S12). If it is identified that the received data unit<br>
is the notification indicator, namely, if the notification indicator is obtained, the UE<br>
checks whether the notification indicator indicates an MBMS service to which the UE<br>
has subscribed to (step S13). Preferably, the notification indicator includes one or more<br>
MBMS service IDs and information about whether to modify the MCCH information<br>
for each service. If the notification indicator includes the MBMS service ID to which<br>
the UE has subscribed to and indicates the modification of the MCCH information for<br>
the MBMS service, the UE identifies it as the notification indicator indicating the<br><br>
MBMS service to which the UE has subscribed.<br>
[66]	If it is recognized that the notification indicator indicates the MBMS service to<br>
which the UE has subscribed to, the UE initiates receiving the MCCH from a<br>
beginning point of a subsequent modification period of the MCCH (step S14).<br>
[67]	Figure 9 illustrates transmitting a notification indicator together with scheduling in-<br>
formation. The UTRAN can transmit scheduling information to a UE once per<br>
scheduling period. In order to simplify a receiving operation of the UE, the UTRAN<br>
may also transmit the notification indicator once per scheduling period. As shown in<br>
Figure 9, the scheduling period is identical to the notification indicator period.<br>
Therefore, the UE can receive the scheduling information and the notification indicator<br>
according to one of the two periods. Preferably, the UE simply receives the scheduling<br>
information and the notification indicator when the UTRAN transmits the notification<br>
indicator before or after the scheduling information is transmitted. Thus, the UE<br>
initiates a reception of the notification indicator together with the scheduling in-<br>
formation once per scheduling period. As a result, the UE may operate in accordance<br>
with the method of Figure 8..<br>
[68]	Figure 10 illustrates another example of transmitting the notification indicator<br>
together with the scheduling information. The scheduling information includes in-<br>
formation about a transmission interval of the notification indicator transmitted within<br>
a corresponding scheduling period. Therefore, the notification indicator is transmitted<br>
according to the scheduling information. Here, a transmission point of the notification<br>
indicator within the scheduling period may not be constant.<br>
[69]	Figure 11 illustrates an operation of a UE when transmitting a notification indicator<br>
together with scheduling information. As aforementioned, the notification indicator is<br>
transmitted according to the scheduling information. Therefore, a UE RRC receives the<br>
scheduling information to obtain information about a notification indicator<br>
transmission period. Afterwards, first and second layers of the UE initiate a reception<br>
of the corresponding notification indicator every scheduling period according to an<br>
indication of the UE RRC.<br>
[70]	When configuring the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped, the UE determines<br>
whether a reception-ongoing time interval is a time interval in which the scheduling in-<br>
formation is transmitted with respect to every transmission time interval (TTI) (step<br>
S20). If the reception-ongoing time interval is identified as the time interval that the<br>
scheduling information is transmitted, the UE receives the SCCPCH during the time<br>
interval (step S21).<br>
[71]	The UE then identifies whether a data unit received during the time interval<br>
corresponds to the scheduling information (step S22). If the received data unit is<br>
recognized as the scheduling information, namely, if the scheduling information is<br><br>
obtained, the UE discontinuously receives the SCCPCH according to the obtained<br>
scheduling information (step S23).<br>
[72]	Additionally, when the UE discontinuously receives the SCCPCH, it checks<br>
whether a data unit received from the SCCPCH corresponds to the notification<br>
indicator (step S24). If the received data unit is the notification indicator, namely, if the<br>
notification indicator is obtained, the UE identifies whether the notification indicator<br>
indicates a modification of MCCH information for an MBMS service to which the UE<br>
has subscribed (step S25). Namely, the notification indicator may include information<br>
about one or more MBMS service IDs and whether to modify the MCCH information<br>
for each service. Therefore, if the notification indicator includes the MBMS service ID<br>
to which the UE has subscribed to and indicates the modification of the MCCH in-<br>
formation for the service, the UE identifies it as the notification indicator indicating the<br>
MBMS service to which the UE has subscribed.<br>
[73]	If it is recognized that the notification indicator indicates the MBMS service to<br>
which the UE has subscribed, the UE initiates receiving the MCCH from a beginning<br>
point of a subsequent modification period of the MCCH (step S26).<br>
[74]	Additionally, the notification indicator may include various information or<br>
messages for a specific MBMS service. For instance, the notification indicator may<br>
include release information of a point-to-multipoint radio bearer for a specific MBMS<br>
service or access information for the specific MBMS service. Once receiving the no-<br>
tification indicator including such information, the UE operates depending on the in-<br>
formation included in the notification indicator. The UTRAN periodically transmits the<br>
notification indicator within one modification period repeatedly.<br>
[75]	If the notification indicator received through the above methods indicates a release<br>
of the point-to-multipoint radio bearer for the specific MBMS service, the UE joined to<br>
the MBMS service releases the point-to-multipoint radio bearer therefrom. Also, if the<br>
notification indicator received through the above methods includes the access in-<br>
formation for the specific MBMS service, the UE joined to the service attempts a<br>
transmission of an RRC connection request message on the uplink according to the<br>
access information.<br>
[76]	As described so far, in the present invention, the network periodically transmits a<br>
notification message (notification indicator) for indicating an MCCH reception through<br>
a physical channel transmitting MBMS data. In response, the mobile terminal pe-<br>
riodically checks the transmission of the notification message and determines whether<br>
to receive the MCCH. According to these methods, when the MBMS data is discon-<br>
tinuously transmitted, the UE can easily receive the notification message and also ef-<br>
fectively receive the SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped.<br>
[77]	Although the present invention is described in the context of mobile com-<br><br>
munication, the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication<br>
systems using mobile devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with<br>
wireless communication capabilities. Moreover, the use of certain terms to describe the<br>
