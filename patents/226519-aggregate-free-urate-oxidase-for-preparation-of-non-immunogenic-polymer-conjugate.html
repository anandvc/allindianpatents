Statement of Government Rights in the Invention<br>
A portion of the research described in this application was made with support from the U.S. Israel Binational<br>
Industrial Research and Development Foundation. Accordingly, the U.S. Government may have certain rights in the<br>
invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to purification and chemical modification of proteins to prolong their circulating<br>
lifetimes and reduce their immunogenicity. More specifically, the invention relates to the removal of aggregates larger<br>
than octamers from urate oxidases (uricases) prior to conjugation nf polyethylene glycols) or polyethylene oxides).<br>
This substantially eliminates uricase immunogenicity without compromising its uricolytic activity.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Statements contained in this background section do not constitute an admission of prior art, but instead<br>
reflect the inventors' own subjective comments on and interpretations of the state of the art at the time the invention<br>
was made. These interpretations may include personal, heretofore undisclosed, insights of the inventors, which<br>
insights were not themselves part of the prior art.<br>
Urate oxidases (uricases; E.C. 1.7.3.3) are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of uric acid to a more soluble<br>
product, allantoin, a purine metabolite that is more readily excreted. Humans do not produce enzymatically active<br>
uricase, as a result of several mutations in the gene for uncase acquired during the evolution of higher primates. Wu,<br>
X, et al., (1992) J Mol Evol 34:78-84. As a consequence, in susceptible individuals, excessive concentrations of uric<br>
acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) and in the urine (hyperuricosuria) can lead to painful arthritis (gout), disfiguring urate<br>
deposits (tophi) and renal failure. In some affected individuals, available drugs such as allopurinol (an inhibitor of uric<br>
acid synthesis) produce treatment- limiting adverse effects or do not relieve these conditions adequately. Hande, KR,<br>
et al., (1984) Am J Med 76:47-56; Fam, AG, (1990) Baillere's Clin Rhsumatol 4:177-192. Injections of uricase can<br>
decrease hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, at least transiently. Since uricase is a foreign protein in humans,<br>
however, even the first injection of the unmodified protein from Aspergillus flavus has induced anaphylactic reactions<br>
in several percent of treated patients (Pui, C-H, et al., (1997) Leukemia 11:1813-1816), and immunologic responses<br>
limit its utility for chronic or intermittent treatment. Donadio, 0, et a/., (1981) Nouv Presse Med 10:711-712;<br>
Leaustic, M, eta/., (1983)Rev Rhum Mal Osteoartic 50:553-554.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/370,084 and published International Application No.<br>
PCT/US99/17514, disclose poly (ethylene glycol)-urate oxidase (PEG-uricase) that retains at least about 75% of the<br>
uricolytic activity of unconjugated uricase and has substantially reduced immunogenicity. In one such purified uricase,<br>
each subunit is covalently linked to an average of 2 to 10 strands of PEG, wherein each molecule of PEG may have a<br>
molecular weight between about 5 kDa and 100 kDa.<br><br><br>
The aggregation of proteins is known to increase their immunogenicity. This understanding has contributed<br>
to the development of methods for intentionally aggregating proteins by treatments such as thermal denaturation and<br>
cross-linking by exposure to glutaraldehyde prior to use in the preparation of vaccines or for immunization of animals<br>
to produce antisera.<br>
Unintentional aggregation of proteins has also been recognized as contributing to immunization or<br>
sensitization during clinical use of therapeutic proteins, e.g. for human gamma globulin (Henney et al. (1968) N. Engl.<br>
J. Med. 278:2244-2246) and for human growth hormone (Moore et al. (1980) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 51:691-<br>
697). The contribution of aggregates to the immunogenicity of human interferon alpha has been demonstrated in<br>
BALB/c mice (Braun et al. (1997) Pharm. Res. 14:1472-1478) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has<br>
been developed for their measurement (Braun et al. (1997) Pharm. Res. 14:1394-1400).<br>
in contrast to the known effects of aggregation on the immunogenicity of proteins, there are not reports of<br>
the effect of aggregation on the immunogenicity of proteins conjugated to poly(alkylene glycols) such as PEG. There<br>
is a need for poly(alkylene glycol)-uricase conjugates that substantially eliminate uricase immunogenicity without<br>
compromising its uricolytic activity. The present invention provides such compositions.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Conjugation of proteins with poly(alkylene glycols), especially PEG, produces conjugates with reduced<br>
immunogenicity and increased persistence in the bloodstream. In attempting to produce substantially non-<br>
immunogenic conjugates of uricase that retain substantially all of the uricolytic activity of the unmodified uricase<br>
preparation, it was discovered that traces of large aggregates of uricase in the starting material were surprisingly<br>
effective at provoking both antibody formation and accelerated clearance from the circulation, both of which are,<br>
deleterious, after repeated injections of PEG conjugates prepared from uricase containing such aggregates.<br>
Surprisingly, the present inventors found that the increased immunogenicity and acceiarated clearance were not due<br>
to the presence of well-defined, moderate-sized aggregates of the uricase subunit that are larger than the native<br>
tetramer, e.g. aggregates containing eight subunits (octamers). The octameric form of uricase is present at<br>
sufficiently high concentrations in most preparations of uricase to be detectable by its absorbance of UV light, e.g. at<br>
214 nm or 276 nm, or by its contribution to the refractive index or other measurements of protein concentration.<br>
Nevertheless, the octamers themselves were found to contribute minimally to the immunogenicity and accelerated<br>
clearance of PEG-uricase conjugates, in contrast with the much smaller quantities of the much larger aggregates that<br>
are undetectable by UV absorbance under the conditions tested but are readily detected by static (Raleigh) or dynamic<br>
light scattering. Therefore, the removal of such traces of very large aggregate:; prior to conjugation with PEG was<br>
found to decrease the immunoganicity and the accelerated clearance of the resultant PEG-uricase conjugates to a<br>
surprising extent.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is purified urate oxidase (uricase) substantially free of aggregates<br>
larger than octamers. Preferably, the uricase is mammalian uricase. More preferably, the uricase is porcine liver,<br>
bovine liver or ovine liver uricase. In one aspect of this preferred embodiment, the uricase is recombinant. In another<br><br><br>

liver uricase. Advantageously, the uricase is chimeric. Preferably, the uricase is PKS uricase. In another aspect of<br>
this preferred embodiment, the uricase has substantially the sequence of baboon liver uricase in which tyrosine 97 has<br>

In one aspect of this preferred embodiment, the uricase described above is conjugated to polyethylene<br>
glycol) or polylethylene oxide), under conditions such that the uricase in the conjugate is substantially free of<br>
aggregates larger than octamers. Preferably, the uricase is conjugated to polylethylene glycol) or polylethylene oxide)<br>
via a urethane (carbamate), secondary amine or amide linkage, in one aspect of this preferred embodiment, the<br>
polylethylene glycol) is monomethoxy polylethylene glycol). In another aspect of this preferred embodiment, the<br>
polylethylene glycol) or polylethylene oxide) has a molecular weight between about 5 kOa and 30 kOa. Preferably, the<br>
polylethylene giycol) or polylethylene oxide) has a molecular weight between about 10 kDa and 20 kDa.<br>
Advantageously, the average number of strands of said polylethylene glycol) or polylethylene oxide) is between about<br>
2 and 12 strands per uricase subunit. More advantageously, the average number of strands of said polylethylene<br>
glycol) or polylethylene oxide) is between about 6 and 10 per uricase subunit. Most advantageously, the average<br>
number of strands of said polylethylene glycol) or polylethylene oxide) is between about 7 and 9 per uricase subunit.<br>
Preferably, the polylethylene glycol) or polylethylene oxide) is linear. Alternatively, the polylethyiene glycol) or<br>
polylethylene oxide) is branched.<br>
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for lowering uric acid levels in a body fluid<br>
or tissue, comprising the uricase conjugate described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the<br>
composition is stabilized by lyophilization and dissolves upon reconstitution to provide sohitions suitable for parenteral<br>
administration.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method for purifying uricase having reduced immunogenicity,<br>
comprising the step of separating uricase aggregates larger than octamers in uricase fractions, and excluding such<br>
aggregates from the purified uricase. Preferably, the separating step comprises the step of detecting aggregates<br>

aggregates. Advantageously, the detecting step comprises measurement of light scattering.<br>
The present invention also provides isolated uricase prepared by the method described above.<br><br><br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 illustrates uricase activity, total protein and salt concentrations in fractions from a Pharmacia<br>
Biotech Mono 0 (1 x 10 cm) anion exchange column. Uricase activity was measured at room temperature by<br>
monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 292 nm of 100 μM uric acid in 200 mM sodium borate, pH 9.2. Total<br>
protein was determined from the area under the curve of the absorbance peak of uricase in size-exclusion HPLC<br>
analyses.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates size-exclusion HPLC analysis on a Pharmacia Superdex 200 column (1 x 30 cm) of the<br>
load and selected fractions from a preparative Mono Q chromatography of porcine uricase containing the mutations<br>
R291K and T301S (PKS uricase) showing data obtained by a light-scattering detector at 90°C (upper curves) and by<br>
absorbance at 276 nm (lower curves). The different signal strengths of the tetrameric, octameric and more highly<br>
aggregated forms of uricase in the unfractionated sample (load) and the various fractions are evident. The load was<br>
diluted 1/5 with Mono Q column buffer, fraction 5 was diluted 1/3 and fraction 6 was diluted 1/9. Fractions 5 and 6<br>
were combined to form the "low salt pool."<br>
Figure 3 illustrates size-exclusion analyses of fractions from the Mono 0 column in Figure. 1, showing data<br>
obtained by a light-scattering detector at 90° and by absorbance at 276 nm, as in Figure 2. The fractions shown in<br>
this figure were used to form the "high salt pool", from which PEG conjugates were prepared and injected into BALB/c<br>
mice. The resultant serum activities and immunologic responses in BALB/c mice are shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates octamer content, determined by absorbance at 276 nm and by light scattering at 90°,<br>
calculated from the data in Figures 2 and 3, of unfractionated PKS uricase and of selected fractions from the<br>
preparative MonoQ column chromatography of PKS uricase (Figure 1).<br>
Figure 5 illustrates UV assays, as in Figure 1, of uricase activity after a 4-hour incubation at 37°C, in sera<br>
drawn 24 hours after each of six weekly injections of 6 x 10-kDa PEG conjugates of PKS uricase or of pools from<br>
Mono Q column fractions.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates ELISA analyses of IgG antibody formation against PEG conjugates of PKS uricase and<br>
against PEG conjugates of the pools of fractions from the Mono Q column shown in Figure 1, in sera drawn 24 hours<br>
after each of six weekly injections of female BALB/c mice with 0.2 mg of uricase protein per 20 grams of body<br>
weight. For each mouse, data from bleedings 24 hours after the first through sixth injections are shown from left to<br>
right. The assay conditions are described in Example 6. Data for the eight mice in each group were arranged in order<br>
of increasing immune response, from left to right.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Previous studies have shown that when a significant reduction in the immunogenicity and/ or antigenicity of<br>
uricase is achieved by conjugation with PEG (PEGylation), it is invariably associated with a substantial loss of<br>
uricolytic activity. The present invention includes the observation that traces of aggregates of urate oxidases larger<br>
than octamers substantially contribute to immunogenicity and the induction of accelerated clearance of PEG-uricase<br><br><br>
conjugates. This discovery is most likely applicable to proteins other than uricases, including interferons and growth<br>
factors.<br>
The safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness of biopharmaceuticais are all adversely impacted by<br>
decreases in their potencies and the resultant need to increase the administered dose. Thus, there is a need for a safe<br>
and effective alternative means for lowering elevated levels of uric acid in body fluids, including blood and urine. The<br>
present invention provides a method for producing uricase that excludes uricase aggregates larger than octamers for<br>
use in the synthesis of PEG-uricase. This PEG-uricase retains all or nearly all of the uricoiytic activity of the<br>
unmodified enzyme. The present invention also provides purified uricase substantially free of aggregates larger than<br>
octamers. The term "substantially free" indicates that the purified uricase comprises no more than about 2%, and<br>
preferably no more than about 1% of aggregates larger than octamers.<br>
The present invention provides a method for purifying uricase such that aggregates larger then octamers are<br>
excluded from the purified preparation. Because these larger aggregates are highly immunogenic, their presence in the<br>
purified uricase preparation is undesirable. The method involves monitoring column fractions by light scattering rather<br>
than or in addition to ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm, because the aggregates may be too dilute to be detected by<br>
ultraviolet absorbance. The purified uricase is then conjugated to water- soluble polymers, preferably polyethylene<br>
glycols) or polyethylene oxides) as described in copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/370,084.<br>
The removal of aggregated uricase from a preparation consisting predominantly of tetrameric uricase can be<br>
accomplished by any of the methods known to those skilled in the art, including size-exclusion cnromatography, ion-<br>
exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration through a microporous membrane and centrifugation, including<br>
ultracentrifugation. The separation method may include separation and analysis of fractions and the rejection or<br>
exclusion of those fractions containing excessive quantities of large aggregates. The resultant uricase preparation is<br>
better suited for the synthesis of substantially non-immunogenic conjugates of uricase than is the unfractionated<br>
uricase. For chronic administration, it is important that PEG conjugates of proteins, e.g. PEG-uricase, have low<br>
immunogenicity and do not provoke progressively more rapid clearance from the bloodstream after repeated doses.<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions of the polymer-uricase conjugates. These<br>
conjugates are substantially non-immunogenic and retain at least 75%, preferably 85%, and more preferably 95% or<br>
more of the uricoiytic activity of the unmodified enzyme. Uricases suitable for conjugation to water- soluble polymers<br>
include naturally occurring urate exidases isolated from bacteria, fungi and the tissues of plants and animals, both<br>
vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as recombinant forms of uricase, including mutated, hybrid, and/or truncated<br>
enzymatically active variants of uricase. Water-soluble polymers suitable for use in the present invention include<br>
linear and branched polyethylene glycols) or polyethylene oxides), all commonly known as PEGs. Examples of<br>
branched PEG are the subject of U.S. Patent 5,643,575. One preferred example of linear PEG is monomethoxyPEG, of<br>
the general structure CH3O - (CH2CH2O) nH, where n varies from about 100 to about 2,300.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a conjugate of urate oxidase {uricase) that retains at least about<br>
75% of the uricoiytic activity of unconjugated uricase and has substantially reduced immunogenicity. The uricase of<br><br><br>
this aspect of the invention may be recombinant. Whether recombinant or not, the uricase may be of mammalian<br>
origin. In one aspect of this embodiment, the uricase may be porcine, bovine or ovine liver uricase. In another aspect<br>
of this embodiment, the uricase may be chimeric. The chimeric uricase may contain portions of porcine liver and/ or<br>
baboon liver uricase. For example, the chimeric uricase may be porcine uricase containing the mutations R291K and<br>
T301S (PKS uricase). Alternatively, the uricase may be baboon liver uricase in which tyrosine 97 has been replaced<br>
by histidine, whereby the specific activity of the uricase may be increased by at least about 60%. The uricase of the<br>
invention, whatever the origin, may also be in a form that is truncated, either at the amino terminal, or at the carboxyl<br>
terminal, or at both terminals. Likewise, the uricase may be fungal or microbiai uricase. In one aspect of this<br>
embodiment, the fungal or microbiai uricase may be a naturally occurring or recombinant form of uricase from<br>
Aspergillus flams, Arthrobacter globiformis, Bacillus sp. or Candida utilis. Alternatively, the uricase may be an<br>
invertebrate uricase, such as, for example, a naturally occurring or recombinant form of uricase from Drosophila<br>
melanogaster or Drosophila psaudoobscura. The uricase of the invention may also be a plant uricase, for example, a<br>
naturally occurring or recombinant form of uricase from soybean root nodule (Glycine max). The PEG may have an<br>
average molecular weight between about 5 kDa and 100 kOa; preferably the PEG may have an average molecular<br>
weight between about 8 kDa and 60 kDa; more preferably, the PEG may have an average molecular weight between<br>
about 10 kDa and about 40 kDa, such as, for example, 10 to 20 kDa. The average number of covaiently coupled<br>
strands of PEG may be 2 to 12 strands per uricase subunit; preferably, the average number of covalantly coupled<br>
strands may be 6 to 10 per subunit; more preferably, the average number of strands of PEG may be 7 to 9 per subunit.<br>
In one aspect of this embodiment, the uricase may be tetrameric. The strands of PEG may be covatently linked to<br>
uricase via urethane (carbamate) linkages, secondary amine linkages, and/or amide linkages. When the uricase is a<br>
recombinant form of any of the uricases mentioned herein, the recombinant form may have substantially the sequence<br>
of the naturally occurring form.<br>
One preferred mammalian uricase is recombinant pig- baboon chimeric uricase, composed of portions of the<br>
sequences of pig liver and baboon liver uricase, both of which were first determined by Wu, et al., (1989). One<br>
example of such a chimeric uricase contains the first 288 amino acids from the porcine sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) and<br>
the last 16 amino acids from the baboon sequence (SEQ 10 NO: 2). Hershfield, et al., International Publication WO<br>
00/08196, Urate Oxidase, published February 17,2000. Since the latter sequence differs from the porcine sequence<br>
at only two positions, having a lysine (K) in place of arginine at residue 291 and a serine (S) in place of threonine at<br>
residue 301, this mutant is referred to as pig-K-S or PKS uricase (SEQ ID NO: 3). PKS uricase has one more lysine<br>
residue and, hence, one more potential site of PEGylation than either the porcine or baboon sequence.<br>
 the optimal<br>
conditions were determined for expression in E. coli, using standard methods. See Erlich, HA, (Ed.) (1989) PCR<br>
Technology. Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. New York: Stockton Press; Sambrook, J, et al., (1989)<br>
Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press. The recombinant uricases were extracted, purified and their stability and activity were assessed using a<br><br><br>
modification of standard assays. See Fridovich, 1, (1965) J Biol Chem 240:2491-2494; Nishimura, et al., (1979), and<br>
Examples 1 and 5.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, uricase may be conjugated via a biologically stable, nontoxic, covalent<br>
linkage to a relatively small number of strands of PEG. Such linkages may include urethane (carbamate) linkages,<br>
secondary amine linkages, and amide linkages. Various activated PEGs suitable for such conjugation are available<br>
commercially from Shearwater Polymers, Huntsville, AL.<br>
For example, urethane linkages to uricase may be formed by incubating uricase in the presence of the<br>
succinimidyl carbonate (SO or p-nitrophenyl carbonate (NPC) derivative of PEG. SC- PEG may be synthesized using the<br>
procedure described in U.S. Patent 5,612,460. NPC-PEG may be synthesized by reacting PEG with p-nitrophenyl<br>
chloroformate according to methods described in Veronese, FM, et al., (1985) Appl Biochem Biotechnol 11:141-152,<br>
and in U.S. Patent 5,286,637. The methods described in the '637 patent are adapted to PEGs of higher molecular<br>
weight by adjusting the concentrations of the reactants to maintain similar stoichiometry. An alternative method of<br>
synthesis of NPC-PEG is described by Buttner, W, et al.. East German Patent Specification DO 279 486 A1.<br>
Amide linkages to uricase may be obtained using an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of a carboxylic acid<br>
derivative of PEG (Shearwater Polymers). Secondary amine linkages may be formed using 2,2,2-<br>
trifluoroethanesulfonyl PEG (tresyl PEG; Shearwater Polymers) or by reductive alkylation using PEG aldehyde<br>
(Shearwater Polymers) and sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
In conjugates containing PEG with a molecular weight of 10 kDa, the maximum number of strands of PEG<br>
that were coupled per subunit, while retaining at least 75% of the uricolytic activity of the unmodified enzyme, was<br>
about 12 strands for mammalian uricases {e.g. PKS uricase, a mutein of porcine uricase; see assay conditions in<br>
Example 5). The latter extent of PEGylation corresponds to about 40% of the total ammo groups. In one embodiment<br>
of the invention, the average number of strands of PEG coupled per uricase subunit is between about 2 and 12. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the average number of strands of PEG coupled per uricase subunit is between about 6 and 10.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the average number of covatently linked strands of PEG per uricase subunit is<br>
between about 7 and 9. In another embodiment, the molecular weight of PEG used for the coupling reaction is<br>
between about 5 kDa and 30 kDa, preferably between about 10 kDa and 20 kDa.<br>
There are several factors that may affect the choice of the optimal molecular weight and number of strands<br>
of PEG for coupling to a given form of uricase. In general, the reduction or elimination of immunogenicity without<br>
substantial loss of uricolytic activity may require the coupling of relatively more strands of PEG of lower molecular<br>
weight, compared to relatively fewer strands of PEG of higher molecular weight. Likewise, each different form of<br>
uricase may have a different optimum with respect to both the size and number of strands. The optimal number of<br>
strands of PEG and PEG molecular weight can be readily determined using the methods described herein.<br>
When PEG conjugates of mammalian uricase were prepared from the purified tetrameric and octameric forms<br>
of the enzyme (containing four or eight subunits of approximately 35 kDa), they displayed profoundly reduced<br><br><br>
immunogenicity in mice, in contrast to the moderate immunogenicity of PEG conjugates of uricase preparations<br>
containing large aggregates (see Figure 6) and the very high immunogenicity of the unmodified enzyme.<br>
Purified preparations of naturally occurring and recombinant uricases usually contain a mixture of very large<br>
aggregates of the enzyme, in addition to the tetrameric (140-kDa) and the octameric (280-kDa) forms. The percentage<br>
of each uricase preparation that is in either the tetrameric or octameric form generally varies from about 20 % to 95%<br>
(see Figures 24). Despite evidence that unPEGylated aggregates of several other proteins are highly immunogenic<br>
[see, e.g., Moore, WV, et a/., (1980) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 51:691-697), previous studies of PEG-uricase do not<br>
describe any efforts to limit the content of aggregates, suggesting that the potential immunogenicity of the PEG-<br>
modified aggregates was not considered. On the basis of the observations of the present inventors, it appears likely<br>
that such aggregates were present in the enzyme preparations used for previous syntheses of PEG-uricase. Their<br>
presence may have rendered the task of preparing non- immunogenic conjugates more difficult. It also appears that<br>
the large losses of uricolytic activity observed in previous efforts to PEGylate uricase were related to the large number<br>
of strands of low molecular weight PEG that were coupled. On the other hand, the methods of uricase purification and<br>
PEGylation described herein permit the covaient attachment of as many as 12 strands of PEG per subunit while<br>
retaining more than 75% of the uricolytic activity, at least for certain uricases, e.g., PKS uricase (a mutein of porcine<br>
uricase) and the enzyme from thermophilic Bacillus sp.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, substantially all large aggregates of the enzyme may be removed by ion-<br>
exchange chromatography (Figures 1-3) or size-exclusion chromatography at. a pH between about 9 and 10.5,<br>
preferably 10.2, prior to conjugation of the resulting substantially aggregate-free preparation of uricase to PEG. The<br>
molecular weight of the uricase in each fraction from the preparative column may be monitored by any size -dependent<br>
analytical technique, including, for example, HPLC, conventional size- exclusion chromatography, centrifugation, light<br>
scattering, capillary electrophoresis or gel eiectrophoresis in a non • denaturing buffer. For aggregate-free uricase<br>
isolated using size-exclusion chromatography, fractions containing only the 140-kDa and 280-kDa forms of the<br>
enzyme may be pooled and used for conjugation to PEG. For tetrameric plus octameric uricase isolated using ion-<br>
exchange chromatography, fractions from the ion-exchange column may be analyzed with respect to size to<br>
determine which fractions contain substantial amounts of the tetrameric and octameric forms without the large<br>
aggregates detected by light scattering. In the purified product, the undesirable large aggregates may thus constitute<br>
as little as about 1 %, or less, of the total uricase.<br>
The results presented herein indicate that, even when extensively PEGylated, forms of PKS uricase larger<br>
than the octamer provoke accelerated clearance (Figure 5) and are somewhat immunogenic in mice (Figure 6). In<br>
contrast, conjugates prepared from uricase that is essentially free of large aggregates (detectable by light scattering)<br>
could be reinjected at least six times at one-week intervals with much less evidence of accelerated clearance rates<br>
(Figure 5) and without the detectable formation of antibodies, as measured by a sensitive enzyme- linked immunoassay<br>
(Figure 6). The use of highly purified tetrameric or octameric urtcase further distinguishes the improved conjugates of<br>
the present invention from the PEG-uricase preparations described previously. In contrast, the presence of a<br><br>
significant content of large aggregates in the uricase preparations used by some previous investigators may have led<br>
them to couple large numbers of strands of PEG in efforts to suppress the immunogenicity. Consequently, the<br>
enzymatic activity of the resultant conjugates was decreased substantially.<br>
The PEG uricase conjugates of the present invention are useful for lowering the levels of uric acid in the<br>
body fluids and tissues of mammals, preferably humans, and can thus be used for treatment of elevated uric acid<br>
levels associated with conditions including gout, tophi, renal insufficiency, organ transplantation and malignant<br>
disease. PEG-uricase conjugates may be injected into a mammal having excessive uric acid levels by any of a number<br>
of routes, including intravenous, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and intraperitoneal routes. Alternatively,<br>
they may be aerosolized and inhaled. See Patton, JS, (1996) Adv Drug Delivery Rev 19:3-36 and U.S. Patent<br>
5,458,135. The effective dose of PEG-uricase of the present invention will depend on the level of uric acid and the<br>
size of the individual. In one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, PEG-uricase is administered in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or diluent in an amount ranging from about 10μg to about 1 g. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the amount administered is between about 100μg and 500 mg. More preferably, the conjugated uricase<br>
is administered in an amount between 1 mg and 100 mg, such as, for example, Ei mg, 20 mg or 50 mg. Masses given<br>
for dosage amounts of the embodiments refer to the amount of protein in the conjugate.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations containing PEG-uricase can be prepared by conventional techniques, e.g., as<br>
described in Gennaro, AR (Ed.) (1990) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Easton, PA: Mack<br>
Publishing Co. Suitable excipients for the preparation of injectable solutions include, for example, phosphate buffered<br>
saline, lactated Ringer's solution, water, polyols and glycerol. Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection<br>
comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or non- aqueous liquids, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions<br>
as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. These<br>
formulations may contain additional components, such as, for example, preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting<br>
agents, emulsifiers, buffers, antioxidants and diluents.<br>
PEG-uricase may also be provided as controlled-release compositions for implantation into an individual to<br>
continually control elevated uric acid levels in body fluids. For example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, regenerated<br>
collagen, poly-L-lysine, sodium alginate, gettan gum, chitosan, agarose, multilaimllar liposomes and many other<br>
conventional depot formulations comprise bioerodible or biodegradable materials that can be formulated with<br>
biologically active compositions. These materials, when implanted or injcted, gradually break down and release the<br>
active material to the surrounding tissue. For example, one method of encapsulating PEG- uricase comprises the<br>
method disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,653,974. The use of bioerodible, biodegradable and other depot formulations is<br>
expressly contemplated in the present invention. The use of infusion pumps and matrix entrapment systems for<br>
delivery of PEG-uricase is also within the scope of the present invention. PEG-uricase may also advantageously be<br>
enclosed in micelles or liposomes. Liposome encapsulation technology is well known in the art. See, e.g., Lasic, D, et<br>
a/., (Eds.) (1995) Stealth Liposomes. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.<br><br><br>
The PEG-uricase pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will decrease the need for hemodialysis rn<br>
patients at high risk of urate-induced renal failure, e.g., organ transplant recipients (see Venkataseshan, VS, et a/.,<br>
(1990) Nephron 56:317-321) and patients with some malignant diseases. In patients with large accumulations of<br>
crystalline urate (tophi), such pharmaceutical compositions will improve the quality of life more rapidly than currently<br>
available treatments.<br>
The following examples, which are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way, illustrate the<br>
various aspects disclosed above. These examples describe PEG-uricases prepared by coupling activated PEG (e.g., the<br>
l-nitrophenyl carbonate derivative) to a mutein of porcine uricases. These examples provide guidance to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art for producing substantially non-immunogenic conjugates of uricase that retain at least about<br>
75% of the uricolytic activity of the unmodified enzyme and are well suited for chronic administration.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparative ion-exchange chromatooraphy of uricase<br>
Preparative ion-exchange chromatography was performed on a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC)<br>
apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). The Mono Q coiumn (1 x 10 cm, Amersham Pharmacia) was<br>
eluted with a gradient of 50 mM sodium carbonate, pH 10.3, 0.1 M NaCl (Buffer A) to 50 mM sodium carbonate, pH<br>
10.3, 0.6 M NaCl (Buffer B) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, except that the sample was loaded at a lower flow-rate.<br>
This technique was used to fractionate 25 mL of a solution of PKS uricase (pH 10.3). PKS uricase was obtained from<br>
Bio-Technology General Limited (Rehovot, Israel). The latter is recombinant porcine uricase in which one residue of<br>
lysine (K) and one residue of serine (S) have replaced one residue of arginine and one residue of threonine, respectively,<br>
in the parental porcine sequence (Lee et al. (1988) Science 239:1288-1291; Wu eta/. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.<br>
S. A. 86:9412-9416). After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 100 mL of Buffer A. The peak of<br>
uricase began to elute at the end of a 31-mL linear gradient of 0 to 26% Buffer B. Most of the uricase was eluted<br>
isocratically by 7 mL of buffer containing 26% Buffer B. The remainder of the recovered uricase was eluted by a<br>
linear 89-mL gradient of 26% to 100% buffer B. Fractions of 4 ml or 6 mL were collected. Aliquots of Fractions #4-<br>
11 were assayed for uricase and total protein (Figure 1) and were analyzed by size-exclusion high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) as described in Example 2 (Figures 2 and 3). The remaining portions of Fractions #5-10 were<br>
coupled to PEG, as described in Example 3. Based on the results of the analyses in Example 2, the PEG conjugates of<br>
Fractions #5 and 6 were combined as the 'Low-Salt Pool* and the PEG conjugates of Fractions #7-10 were combined<br>
as the 'High-Salt Pool," as indicated in Figure 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
Size-exclusion chromatooraphy of uricase monitored by light scattering and ultraviolet absorbance<br>
Size-exclusion HPLC was performed at room temperature on a Superdex 200 coiumn (1 x 30 cm, Amersham<br>
Pharmacia Biotech) on unfractionated PKS uricase and on selected fractions from the preparative Mono Q<br>
chromatography of PKS uricase of Example 1. The eluate from the absorbance monitor (UV 2000) of the Thermo<br><br><br>
Separations HPLC (Sunnyvale, CA) was analyzed by light scattering at 90° to the incident light, using a MiniDawn<br>
detector from Wyatt Technologies (Santa Barbara, CA).<br>
The results shown in Figures 2-4 illustrate the resolution among the tetramer, octamer and larger aggregates<br>
of the uricase subunit and the different proportions of the signals detected from these forms of uricase in the various<br>
samples. Unlike the absorbance signal, which is directly proportional to the concentration, the light scattering signal<br>
is proportional to the product of the concentration times the size of the light scattering unit. The resultant sensitivity<br>
of the light scattering detector to very small amounts of highly aggregated uricase revealed the presence of the<br>
largest aggregates, which are eluted at or near the void volume (approximately 7 mL).<br>
Example 3<br>
Synthesis of PEG-uricase commutes<br>
Unfractionated PKS uricase (from Bio-Technology General Limited) and the uricase in fractions from the<br>
Mono Q column of Example 1 were coupled to 10-kDa PEG using the p-nitrophenyl carbonate derivative of PEG (NPC-<br>
PEG) obtained from Shearwater Polymers (Huntsville, AL). The preparation of NPC-PEG from PEG using<br>
phenylchloroformates has been described in several reports {e.g. Veronese, FM, et al., (1985) Appl Biochem Biotachnol<br>
11:141-152; Kito, M, et al., (1996) J Clin Biochem Nutr 21:101-111) and NPC-PEG has been used for the synthesis of<br>
PEG-protein conjugates by previous investigators including the present inventors (e.g. Veronese et al., supra; Sherman,<br>
MR, et al., in JM Harris, et al., (Eds.) Polylethylene glycoll Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS Symposium<br>
Series 680 (pp. 155-176) Washington, DC: American Chemical Society). The number of strands of 10-kDa PEG<br>
coupled to each subunit of uricase was determined to be six by the method described by Kunitani, M, eta/., (1991)<br>
J Chromatogr 588:125-137.<br>
Example 4<br>
In vivo serum persistence and immunogenicitv of uricase and PEGuricase<br>
PEG conjugates of recombinant mammalian uricases, prepared according to the method of Example 3, were<br>
adjusted to 1 mg protein/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for injection. Samples were frozen and<br>
stored until analyzed or injected. Samples were warmed to 37°C for up to 1 hour prior to injection into groups of<br>
eight BALB/c female mice. The groups of mice had mean weights in the range of 18-22 g at the start of the studies.<br>
The weights of all mice were monitored and evidence of adverse reactions to the injections or other evidence<br>
of ill health was recorded. Twenty-four hours after each of six weekly injections, the animals were anesthetized with<br>
ketamine and 100-200 ΜL of blood was obtamed retro-orbitally. except at sacrifice (exsanguination), whan a larger<br>
volume was collected. Serum was prepared from blood that had clotted for between 4 and 32 hours at 2-8°C. Sera<br>
were stored at -20°C. Sera were analyzed for uricolytic activity as described in Example 5 and analyzed for<br>
antibodies against uricases as described in Example 6.<br><br><br>
Example S	,<br>
Uricolvtic activity assays of PEG-uricase in sera from mice injected with PEG-uricase<br>
An activity assay based on ultraviolet light absorbance (UV assay) was performed with 100μM uric acid as<br>
the substrate in 200 mM sodium borate, pH 9.2, in a microplate adaptation of the method of I. Fridovich (J Biol Chem.<br>
(1965) 240:2491-2494). The decrease in absorbance at 292 nm was monitored for 15 minutes at room temperature<br>
in a 96-well plate with a UV-transparent bottom (Costar, Corning, NY), using a SpectraMAX 250 microplate reader<br>
from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). The data were analyzed by finding the maximum slope (in milli-absorbance<br>
units per minute) of absorbance measurements made during the interval while between 10 and 40% of the substrate<br>
was oxidized. Results obtained with this assay are illustrated in Figures 1 and 5.<br>
The mean half-life in sera of mice injected for the first time with PKS uricase coupled to six strands of 10-<br>
kOa PEG per subunit (6 x 10-kDa PEG PKS) was 29 ± 4 hours, based on data from sera obtained 24 and 72 hours<br>
after the injection.<br>
In separate experiments, it was established that the detectable uricolytic activity in the sera of mice injected<br>
with PEG-uricase declines during storage at -20°C and that maximal recovery of this activity is obtained by a 4-hour<br>
incubation at 37° prior to assay. Figure 5 shows that the recovery of uricolytic activity after repeated weekly<br>
injections of 6 x 10-kDa PEG PKS uricase was greatest when the enzyme was purified by Mono Q column<br>
chromatography, as in Example 1, prior to PEGylation according to the method of Example 3. Recovery was highest<br>
after the injection of conjugates prepared from the high-salt eluate pool of Example 1 (see Figure 1), which has the<br>
smallest content of the very large aggregates (see the light scattering profiles of Fractions 7-10 in Figure 3).<br>
Intermediate recovery was obtained with conjugates prepared from the low-salt eluate pool from the Mono 0 column<br>
of Example 1, and the poorest recovery was obtained with conjugates made from unfractionated PKS uricase, which<br>
has the highest content of very large aggregates (see Figure 2). The same order of relative activities recovered in sera<br>
after repeated injections (high salt pool &gt; low salt pool &gt; unfractionated uricase) was observed regardless of<br>
whether the UV assay described above or a colorimetric assay adapted from P. Fossati et al. (J Clin Chem (1980)<br>
26:227-231), was used and regardless of whether the sera were incubated at 37°C before they were assayed.<br>
Example 6<br>
Enzyme-Bated immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of sera from mice injected with PEG-uricase<br>
Non-competitive EUSA analyses were performed with porcine uricase bound to 96-well Immulon 2 plates<br>
(Dynex Technologies, from VWR Scientific, San Francisco, CA). The primary antisera were from mice injected with<br>
uricase or 6 x 10-kDa PEG conjugates prepared according to the method of Example 3. The secondary antibody was<br>
goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem #401 253, La Jolla, CA) and the<br>
substrate was o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma P-9187, St. Louis, MO), as described by B. Porstmann et al.<br>
(J CIin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. (1981) 19:435-440).<br>
-12-<br><br>
Figure 6 illustrates the results of the non-competitive ELISA analyses. The results demonstrate that the 6 x<br>
10-kDa PEG PKS uricase synthesized according to the method of Example 3 from the high-salt eluate from the Mono Q<br>
column of Example 1 (shown in Figure 1) did not produce detectable immune responses in any of the eight mice that<br>
received weekly injections for six weeks. A few mice injected with conjugates prepared from unfractionated PKS<br>
uricase according to the method of Example 3 showed low but detectable immune responses. The highest incidence<br>
of immune responses was in mice injected with conjugates prepared according to the method of Example 3 from the<br>
low-salt eluate pool from the Mono Q column of Example 1.<br>
Without the benefit of the light scattering detector for the size-exclusion HPLC analyses, as described in<br>
Example 2, it would not have been apparent that the presence of the largest aggregates, not of the octameric form of<br>
uricase, is associated with progressively decreased recovery of PEG-uricase conjugates after repeated injections, as<br>
observed in Example 5 (Figure 5) and with an increase in immunogenicity in BALB/c mice, as observed in Example 6<br>
(Figure 6). These results have important implications for the specifications of the uricase used as a starting material<br>
for the production of PEG-uricase for clinical use.<br>
Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for<br>
purposes of clarity of understanding, it is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings<br>
