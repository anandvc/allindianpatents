				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of device and system for, effecting<br>
cashless transactions. The present<br>
invention has particular, but not exclusive, application to effecting payment for<br>
goods and/or services by the electronic transfer of monetary units or by a credit<br>
transaction<br>
Background Art<br>
European Patent EP-B-0 538 933 discloses down loading information<br>
into a pager memory from an insertable card. The information may include<br>
prepaid credit units whicn are spent by usage of the pager itself, for example<br>
on a per hour basis.<br>
Smart cards themselves are used in many applications including making<br>
cash payments against pre-stored credit units The smart card has electrical<br>
contacts which mate with corresponding contacts in a card writing/reading<br>
device and the user selects the amount of money to be loaded electronically<br>
into a non-volatile memory of the card, assuming always that the user is in<br>
credit. The card is then available for use by the user to pay for small<br>
transactions which is achieved by inserting the smart card into a card reader<br>
and the operator deducting the requisite amount of cash from the non-volatile<br>
memory of the smart card. Whilst smart cards are proven to be of value in<br>
many areas and particularly in the payment of cash transactions, their<br>
disadvantage is that the user always has to take them to a suitable<br>
writing/reading device for them to be credited with more monetary units or for<br>
monetary units to be deducted<br>
Payments by credit card either require the card to be presented by the<br><br>
user at the point of sale or for the card number and expiry data to be given, for<br>
example over the telephone. Frequently the vendor makes a check to obtain<br>
authorisation of the transaction involved.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the invention s to facilitate the making of financial<br>
transactions.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method of effecting a cashless transaction in which payment is effected through<br>
the agency of a device comprising a point-to-point radio transceiver having a<br>
non-volatile storage means containing data required in the execution of the<br>
transaction.<br>
The data stored in the non-volatile storage means may comprise pre-<br>
stored monetary units from which deductions are made in a payment<br>
transaction or credit card details from which payment is made as a credit card<br>
transaction.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
a method of effecting a cashless transaction, comprising presenting a device<br>
having a point-to-point radio transceiver and a non-volatile storage means<br>
storing units of consumable data to a point of sales, effecting payment by<br>
deduction of at least one unit of the consumable data from those stored in the<br>
non-volatile storage means by a two-way radio transaction or by a credit<br>
transaction, relaying details of the transaction to a remote primary station and<br>
storing details of the transaction in the non-volatile storage means.<br>
When the stored consumable data becomes depleted the device may<br>
transmit a request to the primary station to replenish the consumable data in<br>
the non-volatile storage means, the primary station in response to verifying that<br>
the request message is genuine, transfers consumable data as a radio signal<br>
to the requesting device, said device storing the consumable data in the non-<br>
volatile storage means. The request message may include a personal<br>
identification code of the user of the device.<br><br>
If desired the level of the consumable data stored in the non-volatile<br>
storage means may be monitored and when it reaches or is below a<br>
preselected threshold level a replenishment signal is generated automatically.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
system for effecting a cashless transaction, comprising a device having point-<br>
to-point radio transceiving means and a non-volatile storage means containing<br>
data required in the execution of a transaction.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
a system for transferring consumable data to a non-volatile memory, comprising<br>
a primary station having means for connection to a source of the consumable<br>
data and means for transmitting at least some of the consumable data when<br>
required, at least one secondary station having receiving means for receiving<br>
signals transmitted by the primary station, a non-volatile storage means having<br>
a storage area for the consumable data, means lor transferring the consumable<br>
data received by the receiving means to the non-volatile storage means and<br>
means for altering the level of the consumable data stored in tne non-volatile<br>
memory.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
device for use in effecting a cashless transaction the device comprising point-<br>
to-point radio transceiving means and a non-volatile storage means containing<br>
data required in the execution of a transaction<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
secondary station for use in a system for transferring consumable data to a<br>
non-volatile memory, the system comprising a primary station having means for<br>
connection to a source of the data and means for transmitting the data when<br>
required and at. least one secondary station, the secondary device having<br>
receiving means for receiving signals transmitted by the primary station, non-<br>
volatile storage means having a storage area tor the consumable data, means<br>
for transferring the consumable data received by the receiving means to the<br>
non-volatile storage means and means for altering the level of the consumable<br>
data stored in the non-volatile storage means<br><br>
Other aspects and subsidiary features of the present invention are<br>
disclosed in the appended claims<br>
In a particular implementation of the device it comprises a two-way pager<br>
having a non-volatile memory for storing consumable data such as monetary<br>
units, and/or credit card details. The size of the pager is substantially the same<br>
as a currently made plastic smart card but the thickness is greater and is equal<br>
to approximately six standard plastic cards. In an alternative implementation<br>
the device could be of a si2e comparable to a remote radio controlled electronic<br>
car door key. A notable advantage of what may be termed a two-way paging<br>
smart card over and above the standard smart card is that the consumable<br>
data, which in this instance comprises monetary units can be credited to the<br>
non-volatile memory by the transmission of a suitable radio message from the<br>
primary station. Optionally deductions of monetary units from the non-volatile<br>
memory may be done over the air. The transmission of the monetary units<br>
may be initiated by the user following checking of the credit balance in the non-<br>
volatile store or maybe effected automatically by the level of monetary units<br>
being monitored and when the level has reached or has gone below a pre-<br>
selected threshold value then the device transmits automatically a request<br>
message to the primary station which responds by sending a topping up<br>
message to the device. In the interests of security the uplink message from the<br>
pager contains a personal identification number (PIN) associated with that user<br>
which PIN may together with the unique address of the pager provide the<br>
necessary level of security to ensure that only the intended device is credited<br>
with the transmitted monetary units.<br>
When using the device as a credit card, the device is presented at. the<br>
point of sale where the details of the proposed sale or transaction are entered.<br>
These details together with the details of the credit card, for example the card<br>
number and expiry date, and the user's PIN, are transmitted to the primary<br>
station which relays them to the credit card centre At the centre a check is<br>
made that the amount to be debited does not take the user's account over its<br>
credit limit, and if not, the credit card centre sends an authorisation of the<br><br>
transaction over-the-air to the device via the primary station The retailer at the<br>
point-of-sale is immediately advised that the transaction is valid and completes<br>
the sale. Conversely the retailer is advised immediately if the proposed<br>
transaction is not authorised for example because the user's credit limit would<br>
be exceeded or the card has been invalidated because it has been reported as<br>
being lost or stolen and in consequence does not complete the sales<br>
transaction.<br>
The device may by means of a man/machine interface be used to call<br>
up and display financial information on a display panel. The information may<br>
comprise a list of the more recent transactions or a statement of the users<br>
account at a bank or credit card centre.<br>
Brief Description of/Drawings<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings wherein<br>
Figure 1 is a block schematic diagram of one embodiment of a system<br>
made in accordance with the present invention, and<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram of the device in use<br>
Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The system shown in Figure 1 comprises at least one primary station 10<br>
which is fixedly sited and a plurality of transportable devices or secondary<br>
stations 12 of which one is shown in detail. The primary station 10 comprises<br>
an input interface 14 which is coupled by a land line 16 to an external data<br>
base 18 which may comprise a bank and/or credit card centre. Input<br>
information to the input interface 14 is encoded, optionally encrypted, and<br>
formatted in a stage 20 under the control of a controller 22. The data may be<br>
formatted in accordance with a known type of paging signal protocol such as<br>
the CCIR Radio Paging Code No 1 (alternatively known as POCSAG). In<br>
accordance with the POCSAG protocol the address of a secondary station to<br>
which the encoded message is to be sent is appended to the front of the<br><br>
message, the addresses of all the pagers operating on the system are stored<br>
in an address store 24. The encoded and formatted message is supplied to a<br>
transmitter 26 from where it is propagated by way of an antenna 28 and an<br>
intervening diplexer 30 as a point-to-point downlink signal.<br>
Any uplink radio signals to the primary station 10 are detected by the<br>
antenna 28 and passed to a receiver 32 by way of the diplexer 30. The<br>
received signals are demodulated and decoded in a decoder 34. Those<br>
messages which are destined for the data base 18 are supplied to it from an<br>
output interface 36 which is also coupled to the land line 16<br>
The secondary station 12 comprises an antenna 36 coupled to a<br>
receiving stage 40. An output of the receiving stage 40 is coupled to a decoder<br>
42 which decodes and, if appropriate, decrypts the received signal and passes<br>
its output to a microcontroller 44 The microcontroller 44 is operated in<br>
accordance with a program stored in a read-only memory 46. The<br>
microcontroller 44 has outputs coupled to a display driver 48 of an LCD panel<br>
50, to an annunciating device as represented by a loudspeaker 52, to a random<br>
access memory 54 for storing messages and to a non-volatile store 56 which<br>
stores consumable data which is relayed from the data base 18 via the<br>
transmitter 26 and/or credit card number. A man/machine interface comprising<br>
a keypad 58 is connected to the microcontroller 44 Art Infrared Data sensor and a set<br>
of electrical contacts 60 for interfacing with a card reading apparatus are<br>
coupled to the microcontroller 44 The microcontroller 44 is coupled to a<br>
transmitter 62 which has an output coupled to the antenna 38<br>
In one mode of operation the secondary station acts as a normal pager<br>
for alpha-numeric messages. Since this mode is well known in the art it will not<br>
be described in detail but for the sake of completeness reference is made to<br>
the "Book of the CCIR Radio-Paging Code No 1" issued by the Secretary,<br>
Radio Paging Code Standards Group, British Telecom, London<br>
In a second mode the secondary station 12 functions as the equivalent<br>
of a smart card and is able to store a variety of information in its non-volatile<br>
store 56 for use later. The secondary station may operate as an electronic<br><br>
cash card in which monetary units have been loaded into the non-volatile store<br>
56 by way of radio transmissions from the primary station 10. In one<br>
arrangement a user by virtue of suitably actuating the keypad 58 is able to<br>
display on the LCD panel 50 the amount of cash which he or she wants to be<br>
loaded into the non-volatile store 56 for subsequent use. This may be effected<br>
by displaying several preset amounts, one of which is selected by the user<br>
using a cursor. Having selected the amount the microcontroller 44 formats a<br>
request message and adds the user's PIN code. The request message is<br>
transmitted as a point to point signal via the transmitter 62 to the receiver 32<br>
in the primary station 10 The signal may be transmitted as a pseudo random<br>
bit sequence. The message is decoded and the PIN number is checked<br>
against PIN numbers associated with addressees in the address store 24. If<br>
it is confirmed that the request message is a genuine message then a request<br>
is sent by the controller 22 by way of the output interface 36 to the data base<br>
18. The data base 18 checks that the user s bank account is in credit and.<br>
assuming that it is, an authorisation of the amount is sent to the input interface<br>
14. The controller 22 takes the message indicating the amount of the monetary<br>
units to be credited to the user together with the PIN number and appends the<br>
user's address. The encoder 20 encodes and formats the message data which<br>
is passed to the transmitter 26 for transmitting as a point-to-point signal in the<br>
appropriate frame of the POCSAG message to the secondary station.<br>
The secondary station 12 is energised in accordance with the batten/<br>
economising protocol of the paging system and on receiving a transmission at<br>
the receiver 40, it is decoded in the decoder 42 and passed to the micro<br>
controller 44 for checking that the message is addressed to this particular<br>
secondary station and as an additional security check the PIN number is<br>
compared to the one assigned to the pager user. If both check out satisfactory<br>
then the monetary units are transferred to the non-volatile store 56.<br>
The secondary station 12 can thereafter be used as a smart card and<br>
deduction of monetary units held in the non-volatile store 56 may be done Dy<br>
radio over the air or through a suitable IRDA or smart card reading station and<br><br>
payment is effected by simultaneously crediting electronically monetary units<br>
to the supplier of goods or services and reducing the number held in the non-<br>
volatile store 56.<br>
When the number of monetary units is low or has run out then the user<br>
may request more monetary units to be credited to his secondary station,<br>
assuming that he is in credit at the data base 18. Since such an operation may<br>
cause a time delay which may be irritating to the user, it is possible to put the<br>
secondary station into an auto-cash load mode In this mode the micro-<br>
controller 44 monitors the number of monetary units in the store 56 and<br>
compares the number against a pre-selected threshold value. When the<br>
number of units has dropped to a value equal to or less than the threshold<br>
level, the microcontroller 44 formulates a request message which is transmitted<br>
via a transmitter 62 to the primary station 10. As before, the message is<br>
decoded and verified and assuming that the request is found to be genuine<br>
then the data base is asked to release a pre-determined number of monetary<br>
units to be credited to the particular secondary station The user Dy requesting<br>
a current balance using the keypad can be advised of the number of monetary<br>
units held in the store 56 and also can get at least the more recent transactions<br>
displayed on the panel 50. The user may also request via the primary station<br>
that the data base 18 can give access to the current state of the user's bank<br>
account. Such messages will require the use of the PIN code.<br>
In a situation of the users account being overdrawn and no further credit<br>
being given, the data base 18 can initiate the generation of a message which<br>
is relayed via the primary station to cause the paging smart card to be<br>
invalidated and to get the microcontroller 44 in the secondary station to<br>
generate and transmit a message confirming positively that the paging smart<br>
card has been invalidated.<br>
The paging smart card can be revalidated by taking it to a bank or by the<br>
transmission of an over-the-air message.<br>
In the event of the secondary station being lost or stolen, it can be<br>
disabled by an over-the-air message sent by the primary station 10 in response<br><br>
to it being notified of the loss or theft.<br>
When using the secondary station 12 as a credit card, the secondary<br>
station is presented at the point of sale where the details of the proposed sale<br>
or transaction are entered These details together with the details of the credit<br>
card, for example the card number and expiry date, and the user's PIN, stored<br>
in the non-volatile store 56, are transmitted to the primary station 10 which<br>
relays them to the data base 18 which functions as a credit card centre. At the<br>
data base 18 a check is made that the amount to be debited does not take the<br>
user's account over its credit limit, and if not, the data base 18 sends an<br>
authorisation of the transaction over-the-air to the device via the primary station<br>
10. The retailer at the point-of-sale is immediately advised that the transaction<br>
is valid and completes the sale. Conversely the retailer is advised immediately<br>
if the proposed transaction is not authorised for example because the user's<br>
credit limit would be exceeded or the card has been invalidated because it has<br>
been reported as being lost or stolen and in consequence does not complete<br>
the sales transaction.<br>
The secondary station 12 can also store details of all purchases made<br>
and the current standing credit limit Such information can be displayed at the<br>
user's convenience on the LCD panel 50<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the secondary station 12 in an IRDA reader 64 at a<br>
point of sale. A remotely located primary station 10 communicates by point-to-<br>
point messages with the secondary station. The data base 18 is shown<br>
coupled to the primary station 10.<br>
Assuming that the secondary station 12 also functions as a loyalty card<br>
for a supermarket 66, the supermarket computer 68 is coupled to the Infrared<br>
data reader 64 and to the primary station 10 A connection 70 to the IRDA reader<br>
64 enables the computer to monitor the customer's purchases award loyalty<br>
points and give discounts whenever appropriate The supermarket 66 can<br>
advise all or selected customers, via the radio link between the primary and<br>
secondary stations, of special offers, new products, new or changing services<br>
and the like, and the customers by virtue of the uplink can reserve or buy<br><br>
goods, payment being made at the time of ordering or later at collection by<br>
credit card deductions or deductions of monetary units.<br>
Further in the event, of a user making a purchase of say travel or theatre<br>
tickets by telephone or electronically, payment can be effected over-the-air<br>
without having to go to a point-of-sale, evidence of the transaction being stored<br>
in the non-volatile store<br>
From reading the present disclosure, other modifications will be apparent<br>
to persons skilled in the art. Such modifications may involve other features<br>
which are already known in the design, manufacture and use of data<br>
transmission apparatus and component parts thereof and which may be used<br>
instead of or in addition to features already described herein.<br>

transmitted by the primary station (10) containing the consumable<br>
data, a non-volatile storage means (56) having storage area for<br><br>
consumable data, a transmitting means (62) for transmitting<br>
point-to-point signals to the primary station (10), a control<br>
means (44) for controlling the operation of the device (12) in<br>
transferring the consumable data received by the receiving means<br>
(40) to the non-volatile storage means (56) and effecting a<br>
transaction by reducing the level of the consumable data stored<br>
in the non-volatile storage means (56), a display means (50) for<br>
displaying data, and a man-machine interface means (58) for<br>
enabling a user to input a. request for transmission to the primary<br>
station (10) and to request the control means (44) to display on<br>
the display means (50) signals to be transmitted, signals which<br>
have been received, or selected information currently stored in<br>
the non-volatile storage means (56), characterised in that the<br>
system comprises control means (44.) for monitoring the level of<br>
the consumable data currently held in the non-volatile storage<br>
means (56) and, in response to the level dropping below a pre-<br>
selected threshold value, generating a message to be transmitter:<br>
to the primary station. (10) requesting that the level of the<br>
consumable data in the non-volatile storage means (56) be increased.<br><br>
A method of, and system for, effecting a cashless transaction in which<br>
payment is effected through the agency of a device (12) comprising a point-to-<br>
point radio transceiver, such as a two-way pager, having non-volatile storage<br>
means (56) containing data, such as monetary units or credit card data,<br>
required in the execution of the transaction. The monetary units are credited<br>
to the device by an over-the-air transmission and are deducted at the point of<br>
sale. A credit card sale is effected over-the-air with a primary station (10)<br>
coupled to a suitable data base (18).</td>
