(Formula Removed)<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Infectious diseases caused by bacteria and fungi affect millions of people worldwide, and in US alone cause a disease burden of more than $ 20 billion annually. Concerted and systemic programs to discover and develop new antibiotics and antifungals have been driven to a considerable extent by the development of resistance by these organisms to the drugs commonly used against them. However, due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics resistance to even relatively new antibiotics such as vancomycin and methicillin are already reported in Enteroccocci and Staphylococci respectively. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) there were 27 antibiotics and 12 antifungals under development in  1998 against bacterial and fungal infections in all  stages of clinical<br><br>
development. At present, about 100 or so antibiotics are in the clinic. A key challenge to the antibiotic industry is that constant innovation is necessary not only because of resistance, but also because of side effects. Use of erythromycin a well-known macrolide antibiotic used as an alternative to patients, who are allergic to penicillins, exhibit strong gastrointestinal problems and also interact with the liver drug metabolizing enzymes. However, derivatives of erythromycin named azithromycin, dirithromycin are devoid of these problems. So, it is often possible to develop multiple analogs of successful antibiotics that achieve the same results with less adverse side effects. On the other hand these derivatives may increase the cost of chemotherapy. The clinical situation is much more complicated hi cases where the chemotherapy has to be sustained for a longer duration (6-8 months) such as in antituberculosis therapy. The front-line antitubercular drugs rifampicin and isoniazid exhibit significant toxicity in mammalian systems. Gastric irritation, hepatitis, is some of the major side effects of rifampicin whereas, peripheral neuritis, anorexia, nausea, jaundice are associated with higher doses of isoniazid22. Under such situations to reduce the drug associated toxicity bioactivity enhancers (Bioenhancers) can be employed.<br>
Bioenhancers are molecules, which do not possess drug activity of their own but promote and augment the biological activity or bioavailability or the uptake of drugs in combination therapy. Natural products especially from plant sources have played an important role in drug development of communicable diseases. Either the isolated plant biomolecules or its semi synthetic derivatives have provided useful clues in the production of medicines. According to WHO nearly 80% of the world's population relies on herbal medicines as primary health care. Synergism hi which the action of one biomolecule is enhanced by another unrelated chemical has been the hallmark of herbal drugs. For instance, berberine and antimicrobial alkaloid isolated from Herberts fremontii has very weak antimicrobial activity in isolation. However, in combination with other compound 5-Methoxy hydnocarpin (5-MHC) the antimicrobial activity of berberine is increased by 200 folds against Staphylococcus aurues23. Another interesting observation is the combination of piperine isolated from Piper nigrum with essential drugs, such as antibiotics, antihypertensives and antiepileptics as well as nutrients24, phenytoin25, pentobarbitone26, theophylline27 leading to 'dose economy' due to enhanced uptake, higher blood concentration and drug available for long duration in the body (US Patent # 5,536,506; U.S. Pat. # 5,616,593 and 5,972,382). Piperine has also been added hi multi-drug formulations for the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy. A formulation containing rifampicin, pyrazinamide and isoniazid has been tested hi human volunteers (Indian Patent No. 1232/DEL/89). For most<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
drugs, the comparative levels and peak concentration of the drugs in the presence of piperine were higher. We have recently demonstrated the bioenhancer activity of cow-urine distillate in a composition containing antibiotics and anticancer agents (US Patent # 6,410,059). Thus, bioavailability enhancement helps to lower dosage levels and shorten the treatment course. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention to identify a plant extract with bioactivity enhancement activity when used in combination with antibiotics, other drugs and nutrients.<br>
Another object of the Invention is to isolate, characterize and establish the nature of the biomolecule from the active plant extract with bioenhancer property.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to test the bioavailability (absorption or uptake) enhancement of nutrients and drugs through gastro-intestinal membrane when used in conjunction with the bioenhancer.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to identify the mechanism of action of the bioenhancer molecule using in vitro assays. Summary of the invention<br>
A new nitrile glycoside, niaziridin (1) has been isolated by bioactivity-guided fractionation from the pods ofMoringa oleifera, which was able to increase the bioactivity of commonly used antibiotics such as rifampicin, tetracycline and ampicillin against Gram (+) and (-) bacteria. Further the molecule enhances the activity of antifungal drugs against C.albicans and increases the absorption of antibiotics and nutrients through gastro-intestinal membrane. Therefore, niaziridin can be used in combination therapy with antibiotics resulting in reduced drug associated toxicity, reduced cost and duration of chemotherapy.<br>

inhibited the growth of fungi like Trichophyton rubruin and T. mentagrophytes19.<br>
However, bioenhancement of antibiotics, antifungal drugs and nutrients by molecules from Moringa pods has not been reported anywhere.<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of niaziridin as a bioactivity and bio availability facilitator and pharmaceutically acceptable additives selected from antibiotics, drugs, therapeutic and nutraceutic agents and similar molecules which are targeted to the living systems.<br>
Niaziridin can be used in antifungal therapy for the treatment fungal infection caused by yeasts such as C.albicans. The niaziridin can also be used in tuberculosis therapy in combination with rifampicin, isoniazid and other anti-tubercular agents.<br>
Niaziridin the bioavailability facilitator helps in transferring the compounds, drugs and nutrients across the membrane and for better effectiveness on the target site.<br>
The antibiotics are rifampicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, quinolones, fluoroquinolones, isoniazid and similar compounds; nutrients are vitamines, aminoacids, nitrogen bases; antifungal agents are azoles such as clotrimazole, ketaconazole, micanozole and itracanozole.<br>
The compound of formula I functions as a bioavailability facilitator and helps the antibiotics and other molecules to act better on the target by increasing the effectiveness.<br>
The living system may be bacteria, fungi or any living cells. Preferably Niaziridin is used in the range between 0.lµg/ml to 10 µg/ml. In one feature, the lyophilized active fraction isolated from the pods of Moringa oleifera used is hi the range between 0.1 µg/ml to 100 µg/ml. The bioactive fraction enhances the activity of anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-tuberculosis agents from 2 to 80 folds.<br>
The methodology followed by us for this screening included specifically designed bioassays described below as examples. The bacterial and fungal strains used in this invention were acquired commercially from Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) at Institute of Microbial Technology (EMTECH), Chandigarh, India that possessed corresponding properties of the ATCC strain mentioned.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
1,COLLECTION AND EXTRACTION OF POD MATERIALS: 20.0 kg of the Moringa oleifera pods were collected from local area of Lucknow. Pods were separated and air dried at room temperature (35°C-40°C) in shade. After air drying they were ground and sieved to fine powder in a mixer grinder. 8 kg of the powdered pod materials were dipped in absolute ethanol in a percolator for 48 hrs at room temperature (35°C-40°C). Ethanol extract was filtered using Whatman filter paper No.l and concentrated at the 40°C under reduced pressure. The ethanolic extract was then lyophilized to obtain 208 g of crude extract. Stock of 100 mg/ml was made in DMSO and tested for bio enhancing activity. The results in table-2 indicate that the crude ethanolic extract prepared from the pods of Moringa oleifera was able to enhance the activity of rifampicin by 2.5 to 3.0 folds against E.coli CA 8000 (Kumar et al 1976;J.Bacteriology 125: 545).<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
2. BIOACTIVITY GUIDED FRACTIONATION:<br>
Solvent ftactionation of the active crude extracts was undertaken to isolate the active principle. 250 g ethanolic extract was dissolved in 500ml of distilled water. Then it was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The insoluble portion was dissolved in methanol and the soluble portion (H2O) was extracted with Hexane, then chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol (saturated with H^O) respectively. NaSO4 (anhydrous) was added to each fraction for removing the moisture.<br>
All the solvent fractions were concentrated at 400C under reduced pressure and tested. The results indicate that ethyl acetate fraction obtained from the crude pod extract possessed the activity enhancement property.<br>
Table-3: Enhancement of rifampicin activity by ethyl acetate fraction of active crude extract @ 10 ng/ml against E.coli (CA8000).<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
Column chromatography of the bioactive ethyl acetate fraction (7.0g) was performed using silica gel. Different solvent systems were used for the elution of the column sub fractions starting with 100% hexane, then chloroform and then ethyl acetate. 150 ml of fractions were collected and ten such fractions were pooled for further bio-evaluation. The bioactivity enhancement of antibiotics was detected in fractions starting from 30% chloroform + 70% ethyl acetate and upto 95% ethyl acetate + 5% Methanol fractions. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the active column fractions was then performed by a procedure that is well documented and can be performed by a person skilled in the art of natural product isolation. All the spots developed by iodine treatment were separated, and re-dissolved in the appropriate solvent (methanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform) for bio-evaluation. The active spot was further purified five times by the same procedure to obtain 20 mg of single active TLC spot.<br>
3.	CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ACTIVE PURE COMPOUND:<br>
The active spot obtained by TLC was further purified by repetitive column chromatography which can be performed by a person skilled in the art and then analyzed by 1H &amp; 13C NMR, LC-MS to determine the structure of the active pure compound. On the basis of spectroscopic data the new compound isolated from the pods of Moringa oleifera was characterized as niaziridin (formula I), a new nitrile glycoside from nature.<br>
4.	BIQACTIVITY ENHANCEMENT OF ANTIBIOTICS AMD ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS<br>
IN COMBINATION:<br>
Bioactivity enhancement of antibiotics was done by working out killing efficiency of antibiotics alone and in combination with bioenhancer (extract/pure compounds). Bacterial / yeast culture was grown in 6ml nutrient broth and Sabouraud's dextrose broth respectively for 48 hours at 37°C by inoculating a single colony. The culture was divided into 3 sections<br>
and fresh broth of 2.0 ml was added into each tube to made up to 4 ml. Test compounds @ 1.0 and O.lµg/ml were added into two of the culture tubes whereas methanol the solvent used for dissolving test compound was added in third tube to serve as a control. The cultures were grown at 37°C for 4 hours in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm and centrifuged to pellet cells. Cells were washed once as above in sterile water or PBS. Pellet of each tube were then dissolved in 4 ml fresh broth and titre of cells were estimated from each tube by serial dilution and spread plating on NA. Colony counts obtained after incubation for 48 hours at 37°C gave initial titre of cells in each tube. A series of tube containing 5 ml of NB with antibiotics of different concentration were prepared in three sets. 0.1 ml of culture pre-treated with test compounds (1.0 and 0.lµg/ml) as well as from control tube was inoculated into series of tubes maintained in three sets. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours to obtain growth. 0.1 ml of culture was removed from all tubes and titre was estimated as before to give final titre. Results were calculated as fold enhancement in antibiotic killing action from initial and final titre of cells. It was evident from Table-4 that pure compound Niaziridin<br><br>
enhanced activity of commonly used antibiotics such as rifampicin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid etc against E.coli a Gram (-) bacteria. Therefore the compound was further tested for its bioenhancing property against representative Gram (+) bacterial species Mycobacterium smegmatis and B.subiilis. Results in table-5 indicates that the compound enhanced activity of rifampicin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid by 1.2 - 19 folds against both the Gram (+) strains.<br>

Further to determine whether the pure compound isolated from the pods of Moringa is able to enhance the activity of antifungal drugs, similar broth assays were done with clotrimazole, a commonly used azole group of antifungal agent against Candida albicans. The results indicate that (Table-6) the compound Niaziridin was able to enhance the antifungal activity of clotrimazole by 5-6 folds against C.albicans when present hi combination. However, the antifungal activity enhancement was observed only at a relatively higher concentration (lOug/ml) of the compound.<br>

5.	BIOACTIVITY ENHANCEMENT  OF ANTI-TUBAERCULAR DRUGS  AGAINST<br>
M.TUBERCULOSISON BACTEC 460 TB SYSTEM     .<br>
Since, the bioenhancer compound was able to enhance the activity of antibiotics against Gram (+) bacteria such as M.stnegmatis, our subsequent interest was to test the compound against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) (Philipp et al 1996; Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci USA 93, 3132-3137), the causal organism of tuberculosis. To accomplish this we employed a radiometric assay using the BACTEC 460 TB system manufactured by M/S Becton Dickinson Ltd., USA. The antimycobacterial property of the drugs in combination with the bioenhancer was studied as per the recommended drug sensitivity protocol prescribed by the manufacturer (BACTEC 460 TB system: Product &amp; Procedure Manual, MA 0029, 1996; Becton Dickinson Co., USA). Briefly the procedure is described below.<br>
(a)	The 12 B vials as provided by the manufacture were pre-tested prior to inoculation to<br>
establish the recommended CO2 atmosphere. The vials that showed a growth index (Gl)<br>
of 20 or more on the initial test were rejected.<br>
(b)	100µl of the mycobacterial suspension indicating a GI value of 500 were inoculated into<br>
12B containing the antibiotics.<br>
(c)	In the control vial 1:100 fold diluted inoculum was used by transferring 0.1 ml of the<br>
suspension into 9.9ml of special diluting fluid.  After mixing thoroughly, 0,1 ml of this<br>
dilution was added into the control 12 B vial (without a drug).<br>
(d)	Biosafety precautions were taken as recommended by the manufacturer.<br>
(e)	Vials were tested daily in BACTEC 460 TB system for 12 days at approximately the<br>
same time each day as recommended by the manufacturer. The mycobacterial growth is<br>
expressed as Growth Index (GI) and compared to that of the control vials (antibiotic<br>
alone).<br>
It is evident from Figures 1 and 2 that the compound Niaziridin was able to enhance the antimycobacterial activity of rifampicin and isoniazid against the virulent strains of M.tuberculsis.<br>
6.	BIO AVAILABILITY TEST USING GASTRO-INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM<br>
Specially designed U-tubes of glass consisting of two components (opposite-L type) were used in which one open end of an L-shaped was tapered to fit within the end of the other L-tube (as described in US Patent # 6,410,059). The membrane of goat gut (initial part) was stretched and fixed to act as the barrier between the two ends such that by joining the two L-tubes, a U-tube was made. Sterile distilled water was then filled in both the sides to equal<br>
height/level. The antibiotic/compound was added to the donor tube (tapered) and through spectra-photometer, the transfer of molecule was observed using UV and visible absorption maxima of the respective molecules by taking the OD at defined wavelengths (264 nm for isoniazid).<br>
7.	ENHANCEMENT OF ADSORPTION OF λ□ PHAGE ON BACTERIA<br>
Overnight grown bacterial culture (Escherichia coli, CA 8000) was divided into 5 ml of aliquot each in screw cap tubes. One of the tube with the bacterial culture was treated with niaziridin to a final concentration of lµg/ml. Both the control and the treated tubes were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. The cultures were then infected with \ phage (MOI=10) for l0minutes at 37°C (for adsorption) followed by centrifugation at 10000 RPM for 10 minutes at4°C.<br>
The supernatant and the pellets for both treated and untreated cultures were then compared for the phage liter by plating on top agar containing sensitive bacteria at different dilutions. The phage liter hi the supernatant of the treated culture was reduced by 2.6 folds indicating increase in adsorption to the bacterial cells harvested in the pellet. Table-7: Effect of plant compound, niaziridin on X phage adsorption on E.coli cells. <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
8.	ENHANCEMENT OF BACTERIAL TRANSFORMATION<br>
Overnight grown bacterial E.coli DH5 (Sambrook at al28) cells were diluted to 10 folds in growth medium and Irealed with niaziridiu @l-10µg/ml for 4 hours at 37°C in a shaker (200 RPM).<br>
These log phase cells were then treated with calcium chloride to induce competence and then transformed with pUC18 plasmid DNA and plated on Luria agar plates containing 100µg/ml ampicillin. The detailed procedure can be found in Sambrook at al28.<br>
The colonies thus appeared, on the plates for both treated and untreated cultures were scored. An increase of 2.3 folds for transformation was observed in case of the strain DH5aC<br>
and 5.5 folds in case of CA8000 indicating that the compound enhances the uptake of plasmid DNA in E.coli cells. <br>
