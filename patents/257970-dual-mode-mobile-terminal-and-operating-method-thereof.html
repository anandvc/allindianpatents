Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to dual mode systems and nodes. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to the area of WLAN - mobile telephony integration of voice services.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The current GSM/3G and WLAN technologies constitute two separate radio network<br>
technologies. They operate at different frequencies and make use of separate desig-<br>
nated protocols. Currently standardization work is ongoing on integrating data and other<br>
services of WLAN and GSM/3G in the forums of 3GPP, 3GPP2 and IEEE.<br>
Six scenarios dealing with various degrees of integration have been sketched in the third<br>
generation partnership project, 3GPP. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 have been defined so far.<br>
However, the work for scenario 6, i.e. WLAN GSM/3G integration of telephony (Circuit<br>
Switched voice services) has not yet started.<br>
A desirable concept known as "always best connected" aims to ensure that the best and<br>
cheapest service connection is rendered available to the user at all times and performing<br>
handover in such a way that the user hardly notices the underlying access technology.<br>
Currently, dual mode mobile phones integrating different kinds of radio access tech-<br>
niques, such as WLAN and GSM/3G, providing prior art access on the choice of the user<br>
by means of one apparatus have been rendered available on the marketplace. However,<br>
Cellular systems and WLAN systems are currently not interoperable on the network side.<br>
A further problem for the integration of WLAN and GSM/3G services is the pico-cell<br>
character of the WLAN radio network. The WLAN radio network consists of a flat struc-<br>
ture of pico-cells, not at all suitable for typical mobile user behavior. A telephony call<br>
would be difficult to maintain in a WLAN network when a user moves with high speed as<br>
he is used to in a cellular network.<br>
Prior art document GB2336069 shows a dual use mobile station (10, 21,41) having a<br>
GSM interface (451) and a local area interface, such as a RS-232 interface, W-LAN,<br><br>
USB or an IR interface (52) for connecting to a personal base unit (PBU) which com-<br>
prises a (virtual) base transceiver station (BTS) emulator or virtual base station, which<br>
may be implemented by means of a personal computer (PC). The PBU has a LAN inter-<br>
face for connecting to an Interworking Unit (IWU). The interworking unit (IWU) is having<br>
on one hand connectivity for the PBU and a GMS base station transceiver and on the<br>
other hand connectivity to a Home Location Register (HLR), a Mobile Station Switching<br>
Centre (MSC) and an IP Plane. This allows cellular users to utilize private intranets to<br>
carry the cellular services within the intranet coverage area. Access to public GSM net-<br>
work is offered by introducing a transparent location management method, which allows<br>
terminals connected to the intranet to be reached from the GSM network in a normal<br>
manner. The Interworking Unit comprises among others an Intranet Location Register<br>
(ILR). The function of the Intranet Location Register is to store mobility management in-<br>
formation and call statistics of the subscribers configured into the Wireless Intranet Of-<br>
fice system. Roaming of visitors is controlled by the mobile switching centre. For visitors,<br>
only temporary information will be stored into the Intranet Location Register. When a<br>
mobile station is connected to the PBU, for example over the RS-232 cable or RF inter-<br>
face, information such as voice data, Fax SMS (Short Message Service) is transmitted<br>
over the local area network. The information and GSM layer 3 (i.e. Mobility management<br>
messaging, paging, page response, routing area updates etc.) signalling messages are<br>
re-directed to the RF interface branch. When the mobile station and the PBU are linked,<br>
the "field strength" of the virtual BTS will be (rendered) greater than that of other BTS's<br>
in the GSM network. Consequently, handover is made to the virtual BTS.<br>
Prior art document US6119003 shows a multimode cellular telephone capable of bi-<br>
directionally exchanging control messages and status messages with primary and sec-<br>
ondary system controllers, such as a of a D-AMPS (Digital-Advanced Mobile Phone Ser-<br>
vice) and an AMPS network, for automatically switching the state of the terminal be-<br>
tween primary and secondary systems. If the terminal is using its preferred network, then<br>
it stays connected to the primary network until the network is no longer available. If the<br>
latter applies the terminal begins scanning for the second network in an ordered priority<br>
list.<br>

Multiplex Access) protocols. D3 bridges the gap between in-building WLAN network en-<br>
vironment and the external cellular environment to ensure that a data link exists between<br>
the wide area network across the WLAN air interface provided a WLAN access point.<br><br>
Once an interworking node (Ethercell) is aware that a dual mode cellular phone has<br>
been authenticated, it will assign a service point Identification value to the dual-mode<br>
cellular phone. Such assignment will be used for future communications with the dual<br>
mode cellular phone. According to D3 a mapping of IEEE 802.11 WLAN specific values<br>
are mapped to traditional cellular hand-over parameters for enabling seamless hand-<br>
over's between these heterogeneous networks. Throughout any call set-up processes,<br>
all communications between the dual mode cellular phone and the interworking node<br>
take place via a LAPDm (Link Access Protocol in the D channel - mobile) data link using<br>
previously assigned SAPI values during the registration process. All signalling messages<br>
(either GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), TDMA (Time Division Multi-<br>
plex Access), or CDMA (Code Division Multiplex Access)) exchanged between the dual<br>
mode cellular phone and the interworking node are formatted into LAPDm message<br>
frames. The LAPDm message frames are further encapsulated in IEEE 802.11 MAC<br>
(Medium Access Control) headers and transmitted across the WLAN air link. Although it<br>
is not specifically stated how paging is carried out in D3 it appears inherently disclosed<br>
that even paging messages are sent through the WLAN interface.<br>
Prior art document "Interworking Between WLAN's and Third generation Cellular Data<br>
Networks", A. K. Salkintzis, 2003, IEEE, pp 1803-1806 discloses a WLAN adaptation<br>
function (WAF) that supports interworking functions between GPRS (General Packet<br>
Data Radio System) signalling and data over 802.11 WLAN's. The system is intended<br>
for data services and no special means for voice services are defined.<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
It is a first object to set forth a method or an apparatus for integration of telephony be-<br>
tween WLAN and GSM/3G and which provides mobility and paging efficiency while re-<br>
quiring minimum adaptation of existing legacy cellular systems.<br>
This object has been accomplished by the method defined in claim 1.<br>
This object has moreover been accomplished by the apparatus defined in claim 8.<br>
Further advantages will appear from the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
The present invention proposes a method for integrating the telephony service of WLAN<br>
and GSM/3G.<br>
The integrated architecture according to a first embodiment of the invention is shown in<br>
figure 1. A GSM/3G network is shown, comprising prior art elements: base station set,<br>
BSS, Serving Mobile Node, also denoted Mobile Switching Center / Visiting Location<br>
Register, S_MSC/VLR, (also partly referred to as Serving GPRS Support Node),<br>
G_MSC/VLR, Gateway Node Mobile Switching Centre / Visiting Location Register,<br>
S;_MSCA/tR7(also partly referred to as Gateway<br>
—regjster;iHt^Ae7lherplatrrot^^	mobile terminalra	<br><br>
The WLAN AP node may be coupled to the interworking and forwarding node IWFN ei-<br>
ther through an appropriate network such as an Ethernet LAN or via another network<br>
such as an ADSL modem and suitable backbone network, BKBN.<br>
In fig. 2, a logic diagram pertaining to the dual mode WLAN-GSM/3G mobile, MT2, ac-<br>
cording to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. The dual mode<br>
terminal comprises two radio network interfaces - one for GSM/ 3G transmission / recep-<br>
tion, GSM_NIC, and one for WLAN transmission / reception, WLAN_NIC, whereby both<br>
interfaces may be in operation simultaneously. The dual mode mobile terminal moreover<br>
comprises a conventional sound card, SND_C, offering connections to loudspeaker /<br>
amplifier and microphone.<br>
The dual mode terminal may consist of a standard processing platform, such as a laptop<br>
or personal digital assistant (PDA), controlled by a usual common operating system. The<br>
network interface cards may be off-the-shelf components, while the functionality of the<br>
call selection processor and the various logic functions may be performed by a software<br>
application running on the standard processing platform, such as a common laptop com-<br>
puter or PDA.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dual mode platform comprises<br>
a software application, D_APP, which comprises the following logic functions: apparatus<br>
control and call selection, CTRL_CALL_SELCTION, SIP/H323 logic and signal process-<br>
ing, SIP/H323J_OGIC, voice over IP coding/ decoding, VOJP, GSM logic and signal<br>
processing, GSM_LOGIC and GSM voice coding / decoding, GSM_CODEC. Finally<br>
there is provided a camp logic function, CMPJ-OGIC, for controlling whether the dual<br>
mode mobile terminal shall operate over the GSM or WLAN network interface cards. In<br>
the following, a preferred embodiment for the handshaking between the dual mode mo-<br>
bile terminal and the exterior (cf. fig. 4 and 5) is illustrated using SIP protocol signaling.<br>
As an alternative, the H323 protocol may be used.<br>
For the WLAN network interface card, signal streams are communicated over a user<br>
plane, UP, bearing voice over IP packets and a H323 / SIP control plane, CP. For the<br><br>
GSM network interface card signals are transmitted over GSM-codec, UP, and GSM<br>
control signaling plane, CP. In a manner, which shall be disclosed in the following, voice<br>
signals may selectively be transferred between the sound card, SND_C, and the WLAN<br>
network interface card, WLAN_NIC or the GSM network Interface card, GSM_NIC.<br>
The control plane signaling issued on the respective Interface cards shall be explained<br>
later with reference to fig. 4 and 5. It should be noticed that, the principles of the present<br>
invention also applies to a 3G/WLAN equipped dual mode terminal although the exem-<br>
plary embodiment has been shown for GSM/WLAN dual mode terminal. It should be fur-<br>
ther noticed that the term dual mode terminal does not exclude more than two access<br>
technologies being provided in the terminal.<br>
According to the invention a WLAN-GSM/3G Interworking, IWFN, has been provided<br>
between the WLAN AP and the S_MSCA/LR. The IWFN is responsible for "translat<br>
ing" a voice call between GSM voice and IP telephony, that is, translate the GSM audio<br>
codec format to voice over IP audio codec and performing signaling for enabling the call<br>
to be made via standard nodes.<br>
In fig. 3, a preferred embodiment of the IWFN has been shown. It comprises an A-GSM<br>
interface for connection to a mobile switching center, MSC, and an Ethernet interface for<br>
coupling to a WLAN access point AP. It moreover comprises an GSM codec coder and<br>
decoding unit, GSMJJ, as well as a voice over IP coding and decoding unit, VOJP, for<br>
translating a GSM codec stream into voice over IP stream and vice versa. Moreover, the<br>
unit comprises a SIP signaling protocol control unit, CTRL_SIP, for transmitting for sig-<br>
naling to a GSM interface card. It moreover contains a H.323 service. The functionality<br>
of the IWFN shall be dealt with in more detail later.<br>
As mentioned above, the WLAN AP node may be coupled to the interworking and for-<br>
warding node IWFN either through an appropriate network such as an Ethernet LAN or<br>
via another network such as an ADSL modem and suitable backbone network, BKBN.<br>
According to the invention, The Serving MSC is configured such that it can hand over a<br>
voice call from the Base station to the new IWF node. However, the IWF node preferably<br>
"appears like* an ordinary base station system, BSS, to the MSC and normal HO is done<br>
between WLAN and GSM/3G from the MSC point of view.<br><br>
Advantageously, the dual mode mobile terminal MT2 may identify the IWF node by an IP<br>
address that is preconfigured In the dual mode mobile terminal, MT2.<br>
According to the invention as exemplary system is envisaged where many AP's are pro-<br>
vided In different locations so as to provide so-called "hot-spof access to prescription<br>
users. The system according to the invention may moreover comprise predetermined<br>
lhr^n,^H"tP?hVide? in hTB and °ffiCe environments. Common for these AP's are that they<br>
are coupled to the mterworking node, IWFN, according to the invention, alternatively,<br>
that there are provided several interworklng nodes to which respective the AP's are cou-<br>
pled.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention shall now be explained with reference to fig 4<br>
and 5.<br>
I. - Signaling method for incoming voice calls from the GSM/3G system and hand-over to<br>
the WLAN radio interface of a dual mode terminal<br>
Figure 4 and 5 shows the signaling sequence according to the invention where a voice<br>
call is received tn the cellular network and handed over to the WLAN network interface<br>
card of the dual mode terminal.<br>
In the present embodiment the dual mode terminal is active and is attached to both the<br>
GSM network as well as a WLAN network. It should be understood that the network pro-<br>
vider both supports both the GSM facilities as well as the WLAN facilities to the dual<br>
user subscriber.<br>
1.	An Incoming Voice Call to Gateway G-MSC (GSM Mobile Switching Center)<br>
/VLR Is detected<br>
2.	the G-MSC Initiates a HLR Location Request to find the S-MSC to which the ad-<br>
dressed terminal Is attached, the HLR responds<br>
3.	the G-MSC signals a Call Arrived message to the S-MSC<br>

7.	the dual mode mobile terminal performs a determination as to whether WLAN<br>
access is possible from an AP providing WLAN telephony calls, and if so, de-<br>
cides to proceed further over the WLAN radio interface (by the mechanism pro-<br>
posed below in connection with fig. 8)<br>
8.	a Page Response is sent from MT2 to WLAN AP (the IWF is addressed an IP<br>

30. caiTln progress	<br><br>
The SIP signals comparative to the SIP protocol have been indicated in brackets above.<br>
It Is seen that in. relatjpp to a prior art GSM call, the voice call according to the Invention<br>
Is routed to the IWFN instead of to the Base station (BSS) in the serving MSC.<br>
II.	- Signaling method for making outgoing voice calls from a WLAN radio Interface to a<br>
GSM/3G system<br>
A method is also set forth involving a user of the dual mode terminal Initiating a phone<br>
call. This procedure shall also be explained with respect to fig. 4 and 5, using the follow-<br>
ing steps:<br>
-.' The user of the dual mode terminal, MT2, wants to make an outgoing telephone<br>
call<br>
7. The dual mode mobile terminal decides to make the call over the WLAN network<br>
interface card (by the mechanism proposed below as explained in connection with<br>
fig. 6)<br>
8.- 30 A voice call setup signal is sent via WLAN AP IWFN to S-MSC (the IWF is<br>
addressed by a MT preconfigured IP address) as explained according to steps 8 -<br>
30 above<br>
The voice call is handled as usual in the GSM/3G network and is setup towards the fixed<br>
end user, The call is made and when completed the dual mode mobile terminal goes<br>
back to camp on the GSM/3G channel.<br>
III.	- Signaling method for handing over a voice call from the WLAN radio interface to the<br>
GSM/3G interface of the dual mode terminal<br>
If during a voice call in WLAN radio access, the dual mode mobile terminal moves out of<br>
reach for the WLAN AP, a handover to GSM/3G is triggered. The action taken in the<br>
dual mode mobile tormina) is as follows:<br><br>
As mentioned above, when a particular predefined AP is discovered ("home AP"), 103,<br>
WLAN access may be selected, MS3, without any timer being set. WLAN is installed in<br>
many homes today, and a given Home AP may be set as preferred access. Alternatively,<br>
a typical preferred AP may be the WLAN in the office, hence more than one pre-defined<br>
"home AP" may be provided.<br>
In any case, when the selection mechanism enters the state "WLAN Access Allowed",<br>
MS3, the behavior of the dual mode mobile terminal can be such that the dual mode<br>
mobile terminal by itself always access through the WLAN or alternatively it can be indi-<br>
cated to the user that this state has been entered, so that the user can chose to do ac-<br>
cess by WLAN. Preferable, the actual state is notified to the user when the state is en-<br>
tered or left or when an automatic transition between the WLAN system and the<br>
GSM/3G system occurs. This notification can be a noise signal, a light signal, a buzz<br>
signal, a message or an icon on the display or any other type of signal.<br>
The above mechanism secures that if the user of the dual mode terminal is on the move<br>
and is passing through a given area in which WLAN access is available, the readiness<br>
for responding, making and keeping GSM/3g phone calls, including during GSM/3G<br>
handover, is prioritised and secured. On the other hand, if the user is within a "station-<br>
ary" reach of a "home AP", calls are enabled over the WLAN interface.<br>
If the user remains within coverage of the predetermined home AP, but is not using the<br>
dual mode mobile terminal actively, the dual mode terminal may enter a power save<br>
mode in which the WLAN network interface card is set to sleep after a suitable period of<br>
inactivity, 106. If activity is again encountered involving attempting to use the WLAN<br>
network interface or an activity on the GSM interface is encountered, a wake-up request<br>
107, places the terminal back in the WLAN access allowed state, MS4. In this instance<br>
the user may or may not have moved out of WLAN coverage, in the former case, the<br>
dual mode mobile terminal entering state MS1.<br><br>
This mechanism may work as exemplified by the states of the dual mode mobile terminal<br>
MS1, MS2 and MS3 and the corresponding change state conditions that are shown in<br>
figure 6. There is moreover provided an optional power save mode MS4, in view of the<br>
relatively high power consumption of current WLAN network interface cards. The selec-<br>
tion mechanism may be implemented in the application, D-APP, in the logic function<br>
camping logic, CMPJJDGIC, shown in fig. 2.<br>
The mobile terminal initially adopts a WLAN access disallowed state, MS1, searching for<br>
WLAN AP's, 101. if a WLAN AP is identified offering access, state MS2 js adopted. One<br>
way of determining whether the found AP is offering connection to an JWFN is that the<br>
terminal tries to communicate with the IWFN, sending a WLAN Call message (cf. fig. 4)<br>
step 8-WLAN Call (Page Response)) and await an Invite, (cf. fig. 4, step 13, Invite) or<br>
some other message, such as Pinging the IWFN.<br>
In state MS2 a timer value T1 is defined such that, if the dual mode mobile terminal has<br>
heard the same WLAN AP for a time longer than given by the timer, MS2 - "WLAN ac-<br>
cess disallowed wait for T1", then the dual mode mobile terminal is set in a state, MS3,<br>
allowing voice calls to be handed over to WLAN, "WLAN access allowed", since the dual<br>
mode mobile terminal is probably not moving, if the signal is lost the mobile terminal<br>
goes back to MS1,102. When, in MS3, the dual mode mobile terminal cannot hear the<br>
WLAN AP anymore -104, WLAN lost - the dual mode mobile terminal is set to state<br>
"WLAN access disallowed", MS1. WLAN access may also be allowed when one of a set<br>
of pre-defined AP's, such as a "home AP" is found, 103. In other instances, when the AP<br>
Is lost, the WLAN access disallowed state MS1 is chosen.<br>
In MS3 the WLAN Interface card is powered on and will remain so if the WLAN card is<br>
used for transmission or access to the WLAN AP is not lost. However, if no transmission<br>
takes place while the AP Is being present, the dual mode mobile terminal may enter a<br>
power save mode switching off the WLAN network interface card, WLAN_NIC.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the user may also actively select or overrule WLAN<br>
access by giving a command to the dual mode mobile terminal that WLAN access is pre-<br>
ferred. This selection can be based on a presentation of available radio access networks<br>
as sensed by the dual mode mobile terminals, e.g. WLAN AP's that are within reach.	<br><br>
As mentioned above, when a particular predefined AP is discovered ("home AP"), 103,<br>
WLAN access may be selected, MS3, without any timer being set. WLAN is installed in<br>
many homes today, and a given Home AP may be set as preferred access. Alternatively,<br>
a typical preferred AP may be the WLAN in the office, hence more than one pre-defined<br>
"home AP" may be provided.<br>
In any case, when the selection mechanism enters the state "WLAN Access Allowed",<br>
MS3, the behavior of the dual mode mobile terminal can be such that the dual mode<br>
mobile terminal by itself always access through the WLAN or alternatively it can be indi-<br>
cated to the user that this state has been entered, so that the user can chose to do ac-<br>
cess by WLAN. Preferable, the actual state is notified to the user when the state is en-<br>
tered or left or when an automatic transition between the WLAN system and the<br>
GSM/3G system occurs. This notification can be a noise signal, a light signal, a buzz<br>
signal, a message or an icon on the display or any other type of signal.<br>
The above mechanism secures that if the user of the dual mode terminal is on the move<br>
and is passing through a given area in which WLAN access is available, the readiness<br>
for responding, making and keeping GSM/3g phone calls, including during GSM/3G<br>
handover, is prioritised and secured. On the other hand, if the user is within a "station-<br>
ary" reach of a "home AP", calls are enabled over the WLAN interface.<br>
If the user remains within coverage of the predetermined home AP, but is not using the<br>
dual mode mobile terminal actively, the dual mode terminal may enter a power save<br>
mode in which the WLAN network interface card is set to sleep after a suitable period of<br>
inactivity, 106. If activity is again encountered involving attempting to use the WLAN<br>
network interface or an activity on the GSM interface is encountered, a wake-up request<br>
107, places the terminal back in the WLAN access allowed state, MS4. In this instance<br>
the user may or may hot have moved out of WLAN coverage, in the former case, the<br>
dual mode mobile terminal entering state MS1.<br><br>
