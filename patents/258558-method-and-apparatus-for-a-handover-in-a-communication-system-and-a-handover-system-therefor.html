DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram schematically illustrating a conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has a multi- cell structure.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system has multi cells, e. g., a cell 100 and a cell 150.<br>
Further, the IEEE 802.16e communication system includes a Base Station (BS) 110 that<br>
controls the cell 100, a BS 140 that controls the cell 150, and a plurality of Mobile Stations<br>
(MSs), e.g., 111, 113,130, 151, and 153. The transmission/reception of signals between<br>
the BSs 110 and 140 and the MSs 111,113, 130,151, and 153 is accomplished using a<br>
signal transmission/reception scheme such as an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme or an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA) scheme. In FIG. 1, the MS 130 is located in a boundary region (or a handover<br>
region) between the cell 100 and the cell 150.<br>
Accordingly, the IEEE 802.16e communication system must support handover for the MS<br>
130.<br><br>
As described above, because the IEEE 802.16e communication system must support<br>
mobility of a MS, supporting handover for a MS is important for determining performance<br>
of the IEEE 802.16e communication system. That is, it is also necessary to accommodate<br>
handover for a MS between a plurality of BSs, handover between BSs in a multi-sector<br>
structure supporting a plurality of sectors, and inter-sector handover within the same BS.<br>
At the present time, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has proposed only<br>
extremely restricted handover processes to support handover for a MS. Accordingly, it is<br>
necessary to provide detailed handover processes to support handover for a MS.<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description of the present<br>
invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention unclear.<br>
The present invention proposes a system and a method for handover, that broadcasts<br>
information, particularly, preamble index information, of neighbor Base Stations (BSs) or<br>
sectors in a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system. Specifically, the<br>
present invention proposes a system and a method for handover that enables high speed <br>
handover to be performed by broadcasting BS identifiers (BS-IDs) of neighbor BSs and<br>
preamble indices corresponding to the BS-IDs through a Mobile Neighbor Advertisement<br>
(MOBNBR-ADV) message. In the present invention, the Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e communication system is described as one<br>
example of the BWA communication system. It is natural that a system and a method for<br>
handover proposed by the present invention can be applied to all other communication<br>
systems as well as the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a handover process in an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a Mobile Station (MS) performs a scanning operation for one or more<br>
neighbor BSs (step 211). In FIG. 2, it is assumed that the neighbor BSs are a second<br>
BS(BS#2) 220, a third BS(BS#3) 230 and a fourth BS(BS#4) 240. Hereinafter, the<br>
scanning operation will be described.<br><br>
A first BS 210, acting as a serving BS, broadcasts a MOB-NBR-ADV<br>
message, and an MS 200 receives the MOB-NBR-ADV message and acquires<br>
information for the one or more neighbor BSs. In the present invention, when<br>
the corresponding neighbor BSs support a multi-sector structure, the number of<br>
sectors and preamble indices used in the sectors are added to the information for<br>
the neighbor BSs included in the MOB-NBR-ADV message, so that the MS 200<br>
can perform a high speed scanning operation for the neighbor BSs in a<br>
predetermined interval.<br>
Further, in the present invention, the number of sectors and the preamble<br>
indices used in the sectors are added to the MOB-NBR-ADV message as<br>
described above, so that handover between BSs including a multi-sector structure<br>
can be performed. When the neighbor BSs do not support the multi-sector<br>
structure, only the preamble indices used in the neighbor BSs are added to the<br>
MOB-NBR-ADV message, so that the MS 200 can perform a high speed<br>
scanning operation for the neighbor BSs in a predetermined interval. Because<br>
the information for the neighbor BSs included in the MOB-NBR-ADV message<br>
will be described in detail later, their detailed description is omitted here.<br>
After acquiring the information for the neighbor BSs, the MS 200<br>
transmits a Mobile Scanning Interval Allocation Request (MOB-SCN-REQ)<br>
message to the first BS 210 when the MS 200 intends to scan intensities {e.g.,<br>
CINRs (Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratios)} of reference signals (e.g., pilot<br>
signals) transmitted from the neighbor BSs, i.e., the second BS 220, the third BS<br>
230 and the fourth BS 240. In the following description, it is assumed that a<br>
preamble signal is one example of the pilot signal. For convenience of<br>
description, it is noted that the pilot signal is used together with the preamble<br>
signal.<br>
The MOB-SCN-REQ message includes information, which is desired by<br>
the MS 200 and relates to the scanning for the pilot signal, and a 'Scanning<br>
Interval'. The time during which the MS scans for available BS will be referred<br>
to as a Scanning Interval. The Scanning Interval will be used equal to 'Scan<br>
Duration' in present invention, for the CINRs of the pilot signals transmitted from<br>
the one or more neighbor BSs. The 'Scan Duration' is expressed by the frame<br><br>
unit. Because a timing point at which the MS 200 wants to perform the<br>
scanning operation has no direct connection to the present invention, its detailed<br>
description is omitted here.<br>
After receiving the MOB-SCN-REQ message from the MS 200, the first<br>
BS 210 transmits a Mobile Scanning Interval Allocation Response (MOB-SCN-<br>
RSP) message to the MS 200, which is a response to the MOB-SCN-REQ<br>
message. The MOB-SCN-RSP message includes information for the pilot signal<br>
scanning to be performed by the MS 200. That is, the information includes the<br>
'Scan Duration', a 'Duration' for which the MS 200 performs the scanning, and a<br>
'Start Frame' indicating information for a timing point at which the MS 200 starts<br>
the scanning operation. The MS 200, after receiving the MOB-SCN-RSP<br>
message from the first BS 210 as described above, performs the pilot signal<br>
scanning for the target BSs in response to the information for the pilot signal<br>
scanning in the MOB-SCN-RSP message.<br>
After completing the scanning for the neighbor BSs according to the<br>
scheme as described above, the MS 200 transmits a Mobile Station Handover<br>
Request (MOB-MSHO-REQ) message including information for recommended<br>
one or more neighbor BSs to the first BS 210 when the MS 200 determines to<br>
perform handover based on a result from the scanning (step 213). As described<br>
above, the present invention supports handover to a BS including a multi-sector<br>
structure by adding an 'Inter-sector HO' and a 'Preamble Index' to the<br>
information for the recommended one or more neighbor BSs included in the<br>
MOB-MSHO-REQ message. The 'Inter-sector HO' indicates if the handover<br>
performed by the MS 200 is an inter-sector handover and the 'Preamble Index'<br>
indicates a preamble index of a target sector in a final target BS to which the MS<br>
200 is to be handed over when the handover performed by the MS 200 is the<br>
inter-sector handover. Because the MOB-MSHO-REQ message will be<br>
described later, its detailed description is omitted here.<br>
After receiving the MOB-MSHO-REQ message from the MS 200, the<br>
first BS 210 transmits a HO-PRE-NOTIFICATION message to the recommended<br>
one or more neighbor BSs (i.e., the second BS 220 and the third BS 230) included<br>
in the MOB-MSHO-REQ message (steps 215 and 217). The -HO-PRE-<br><br>
NOTIFICATION message includes a plurality of Information Elements (IEs), that<br>
is, a MS identifier (ID) of the MS 200, information for time predicted as start time<br>
of handover by the MS 200, bandwidth information requested from the MS 200 to<br>
a final target BS to be a new serving BS, and QoS information requested from the<br>
MS 200 to the final target BS.<br>
After receiving the HO-PRE-NOTIFICATION message from the first BS<br>
210, the second BS 220 and the third BS 230 transmit HO-PRE-<br>
NOTIFICATION-RESPONSE messages to the first BS 210 in response to the<br>
HO-PRE-NOTIFICATION message (steps 219 and 221). The HO-PRE-<br>
NOTIFICATION-RESPONSE message includes the MS ID of the MS 200<br>
included in the HO-PRE-NOTIFICATION message, and bandwidth and QoS<br>
information capable of being provided by a corresponding BS when the MS has<br>
been handed over to the corresponding BS.<br>
The first BS 210 analyzes the HO-PRE-NOTIFICATION-RESPONSE<br>
messages received from the second BS 220 and the third BS 230, and selects a<br>
BS, that canoptimally provide bandwidth and QoS requested by the MS 200 when<br>
the MS 200 is handed over to the BS, as the final target BS. In FIG. 2, it is<br>
assumed that the third BS 230 has been selected as the final target BS. Then, the<br>
first BS 210 transmits a HO-CONFIRM message to the third BS 230 to report<br>
that the MS 200 is to be handed over to the third BS 230 (step 223).<br>
Further, the first BS 210 transmits a Mobile Handover Response (MOB-<br>
MSHO-RSP) message the MS 200 (step 225). The MOB-MSHO-RSP message<br>
includes information for the final target BS (i.e., the third BS 230) to which the<br>
MS 200 is to be handed over. Because the MOB-MSHO-RSP message is a<br>
response to the MOB-MSHO-REQ message, the MOB-MSHO-RSP message<br>
includes information added to the MOB-MSHO-REQ message. However,<br>
because this will be described later, its detailed description is omitted here.<br>
The MS 200, after receiving the MOB-MSHO-RSP message, transmits a<br>
Mobile Handover Indication (MOB-HO-IND) message to the first BS 210 in<br>
response to the MOB-MSHO-RSP message (step 227). The MOB-HO-IND<br>
message includes information added to the MOB-MSHO-REQ message, the<br><br>
MOB-MSHO-RSP message, etc. However, because this will be described later,<br>
its detailed description is omitted here.<br>
The first BS 210 after receiving the MOB-HO-IND message releases<br>
connection having been set with the MS 200 (step 229). As described above,<br>
because the MS 200 has already known the final target BS or a preamble index of<br>
a corresponding sector in the final target BS, it is also possible to perform a high<br>
speed network reentry to the final target BS according to the handover.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary case in which the MS 200 determines<br>
handover from the first BS 210 (the serving BS) to another BS and requests the<br>
handover to the first BS 210, that is, handover requested by the MS 200.<br>
However, it is natural that the first BS 210 may request the handover to the MS<br>
200 by an unsolicited scheme even without the request of the MS 200, due to a<br>
road balancing, etc. In this case, the first BS 210 transmits a Base Station<br>
Handover Request (MOB-BSHO-REQ) message to the MS 200 in order to<br>
request the MS 200 to perform the handover.<br>
FIG 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a scanning process in an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, a first BS 310, i.e., a serving BS of an MS 300,<br>
broadcasts a MOB-NBR-ADV message (step 311). In FIG. 3, it is assumed that<br>
neighbor BSs are a second BS 320 and a third BS 330. The MOB-NBR-ADV<br>
message is a message newly proposed by the present invention, that may be<br>
generated by changing a format of a general MOB-NBR-ADV message in the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system or by using a new format.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a format of a MOB-NBR-ADV message<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MOB-NBR-ADV message includes a plurality of<br>
IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' indicating a type of a currently<br>
transmitted message, the 'Operation ID' indicating a network identifier (ID), the<br><br>
'N_NEIGHBORS' indicating the number of neighbor BSs, the 'NEIGHBOR BS-<br>
ID' indicating IDs of the neighbor BSs, the 'DL Physical Frequency' indicating a<br>
downlink (DL) physical channel frequency of the neighbor BSs, the 'N_sectors'<br>
indicating the number of sectors in a corresponding neighbor BS, the 'Preamble<br>
Index' indicating preamble index of a corresponding sector, the 'Configuration<br>
Change Count' indicating the number of times by which a configuration changes,<br>
the 'TLV (Type, Length,Value) Encoded Neighbor Information' indicating extra<br>
information relating to the neighbor BS, a 'Reserved' prepared for an additional<br>
purpose, etc.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, the MOB-NBR-ADV message newly proposed<br>
by the present invention enables the MS to perform a high speed scanning for<br>
neighbor BSs in a predetermined scanning duration by allowing the MS to<br>
recognize, in advance, the number of sectors in a corresponding neighbor BS and<br>
preamble indices of preambles used in corresponding sectors, after adding the<br>
'N_sectors' and the 'Preamble Index' to a general MOB-NBR-ADV message<br>
used in the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
As described above, after the first BS 310 broadcasts the MOB-NBR-<br>
ADV message, the MS 300 receives the MOB-NBR-ADV message broadcasted<br>
from the first BS 310 and acquires information for the neighbor BSs at step 311.<br>
After acquiring the information for the neighbor BSs, the MS 300 transmits a<br>
MOB-SCN-REQ message to the first BS 310 when the MS 300 intended for<br>
scanning of intensities (e.g., CINRs) of pilot signals transmitted from the<br>
neighbor BSs, i.e., the second BS 320 and the third BS 330 (step 313).<br>
After receiving the "MOB-SCN-REQ" message from the MS 300, the<br>
first BS 310 transmits a "MOB-SCN-RSP" message to the MS 300 in response to<br>
the MOB-SCN-REQ message at step 315. The MOB-SCN-RSP message<br>
includes information for the pilot signal scanning to be performed by the MS 300,<br>
a 'Duration' for which the MS 300 performs the scanning, and a 'Start Frame'<br>
indicating information for a timing point at which the MS 300 starts the scanning<br>
operation. It is assumed that the 'Duration' is expressed by N frames and the<br>
'Start Frame' is expressed by M frames in FIG. 3. The MS 300 after receiving<br>
the MOB-SCN-RSP message from the first BS -310 as described above performs<br><br>
the pilot signal scanning for the neighbor BSs in response to the information for<br>
the pilot signal scanning included in the MOB-SCN-RSP message.<br>
First, the MS 300 waits for the M frames from a timing point at which the<br>
MS 300 has received the MOB-SCN-RSP message in response to the 'Start<br>
Frame' included in the MOB-SCN-RSP message (step 317), and performs the<br>
pilot signal scanning operation for the second BS 320 and the third BS 330.<br>
That is, the MS 300 synchronizes with the second BS 320 during the N frames<br>
(Duration) (step 319), and performs the pilot signal scanning (step 321). Further,<br>
the MS 300 synchronizes with the third BS 330 (step 323), and performs the pilot<br>
signal scanning (step 325).<br>
As described above, because the MOB-NBR-ADV message includes<br>
preamble indices of preamble signals used in a corresponding neighbor BS and<br>
the MS 300 performs the pilot signal scanning in response to the preamble indices,<br>
the MS 300 can perform the pilot scanning at a high speed. Thus, it is possible to<br>
perform the pilot scanning for all neighbor BSs within the duration. The high<br>
speed pilot scanning enables a high speed processing relating to handover of the<br>
MS 300 to be accomplished in selection of a recommended target BS, etc. As a<br>
result, high speed handover can be achieved.<br>
Description with reference to FIG. 3 discusses the pilot signal scanning<br>
operation when the neighbor BSs do not support the multi-sector structure.<br>
However, when the neighbor BSs support the multi-sector structure as described<br>
above, the MS 300 performs the pilot signal scanning in response to preamble<br>
indices of sectors in the neighbor BSs because the preamble indices are included<br>
in the MOB-NBR-ADV message. Therefore, the MS 300 can perform the pilot<br>
scanning at a high speed. Consequently, it is possible to perform the pilot<br>
scanning for sectors in all neighbor BSs within the duration.<br>

Although the detailed description is not given in the present application,<br>
when a serving Base Station and a neighbor BS use a common frequency band,<br><br>
the MS can request directly the serving Base Station to perform a handover<br>
without performing a scanning operation, i.e., without transmitting MOB-SCN-<br>
REQ message. The reason is because it is possible to measure, simultaneously,<br>
the strength of preamble signal of base stations using the common frequency band<br>
in accordance with PHY modem. Also, it is understood that when the serving<br>
Base Station requests a signal strength measurement of the neighbor BSs, the<br>
serving Base Station does not require a specific measure interval. That is, when<br>
the serving Base Station and the neighbor BS use the common frequency band,<br>
the preamble index is notified and thus, it is possible to obtain the more speedy<br>
handover by removing unnecessary operation.<br>
As described above, the present invention enables a MS to perform a high<br>
speed scanning by notifying in advance the MS of neighbor BSs and preamble<br>
indices of sectors in the neighbor BSs through a MOB-NBR-ADV message in a<br>
BWA communication system. As a result, it is possible to achieve high speed<br>
handover. Further, the present invention enables handover between BSs<br>
including a multi-sector structure to be achieved by notifying in advance a MS of<br>
a sector index, etc., in a BWA communication system.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
